5,Rotterdam Rocks!,"I am not much into reviews but i have to say that i have heard this concert and feel that the comments about its quality are unfounded. The quality is not true ""off the shelf"" cd quality but it is excellent quality as far as bootlegs go and truly sounds great. The arrangement and flow of the concert is excellent too - well worth the money for the collector."
1,Embarrassing attempt to sound modern,"James adds synths, rappers, drum machines to a bunch of lifeless songs. His voice hardly sounds as good as it did even as recent as the early '80s. The one star is for the ballad ""Georgia-lina"", which actually has musicians playing their instruments on it."
1,Few words for such disappointment,"This movie failed horribly! It should have never been made! GLAD TED BUNDY DIDN'T SEE IT! I guess this is what happens when someone's life, or crimes....is viewed and dissected by another. This was painful to watch. Another dust collector!"
2,Promises Promises. Failed Promises,Not insightful and not interesting this is more a grisly series of vignettes than a movie of depth or substance.Rather than taking us into the mind of the killer as the box said it was just an opportunity to display Ted's insanity in a variety of different settings. Even the girls all blends together since there is no effort made by the filmmakers to give them any humanity.In this case the TV movie was much better.
1,Warning,This DVD was a load of [stuff].This movie skims over some facts and events and totally ignores others. It tells very little of how Bundy manipulated victims. It ignores how much support he had from friends and work collegues when first caught and how they faught for his release. It ignores Bundy's arrogance with the police. It actually portrays Bundy as having no confidence in his crimes and when being interviewed by the police. Other than one line it ignores the fact that he represented himself in court. Skims over his two escapes from prison.If you want to see a factual movie on Bundy watch the Deliberate Stranger on Video.
4,Ted Bundy review,"This movie was really great. Most of the death/abduction scenes were, in fact, accurate (as far as how they happened, but I think the names were changed of the victims, and rightfully so) Some of the other reviewers seem to be misinformed about Bundy's childhood and the enjoyment he got out of killing. He lived in a fantasy world which eventually took over his reality. The movie perhaps didn't make that quite so clear. Bundy just didn't have much of a conscience about it. The execution scene is pretty graphic, but it was not ""funny"". It was a reality, as it is for all of those on Death Row. I do wish they would have put some of the court trial scenes in the movie. If you are interested in the story of Ted Bundy, I highly recommend reading Ann Rule's ""Stranger Beside Me"". It is probably the most accurate and honest account of the serial killer I have read."
2,No respect for victims,"Told from the point of view of Ted Bundy, this film is no holds barred, it provides some quite sickening details of the killer's actions with no explanation of what drove the man. I do wonder about the families of the victims. The victims were portrayed as one-dimensional walk-on parts. I know this is how Bundy would have seen them, as meat and nothing more, but I found it disrespectful to those who died and who were left to grieve. It is clear that the director has no idea of the enormity of these crimes and the affect on the victums' families, if he did he might have thought twice. I suppose he felt the execution scene would create a balance, but it doesn't. These were real people, not inventions, by showing us this the film would have been that much more powerful and convincing."
4,Good,My husband and I saw this movie when we first started dating. My husband was the one to recommended this to me. We liked it so much that I decided to buy for him as a christmas gift. It didn't take long for it to show up at my house. I highly recommend this movie.
5,dark but exciting movie about ted bundy.,this movie will leave you saying how could anyone do the things ted bundy did.as with moct serial movies gacy dahmer etc this movie is a look into the mind of one of the most fasmous serial killers.definately the best of the movies made about bundy.
3,One sick S.O.B.,"First let me say this: My husband taped this for me because he knows I am interested in forensic psychology. Well, this movie summed up the ""psychology"" in one scene, while leaving out the major points completely. ""Ted"" mentions that it was upsetting to find out that his sister was really his mother, and that his father wasn't really his father...ok....and???? What about the girl whom he was in love with earlier in life who ditched him? I think by leaving out this crucial, emotional event in Ted's life, it makes his whole trail of murder and mayhem less believable. Of course, the fact remains, he was just plain, flippin' nuts...."
1,A pathetically poor effort at film-making,"I characterize this version of the well-known Ted Bundy story as a total failure. From the gratuitous manner in which the film capitalizes on Bundy's gruesome crimes, to the poor cinematography, this film packs about as much meat as a marshmallow. In fact, when it was over, I really felt like I had wasted my time watching it. It taught me absolutely nothing about the real Ted Bundy. Even if you really get into grotesque violence, there are certainly much better movies with far more intelligently written screenplays than this one. The whole movie is filled with poorly shot scenes and inappropriate music throughout. Hang it up, Mr. Bright, you're not a film-maker. This film simply sucked."
1,Aweful,"This is one of the worst films that I have ever seen. The makers try to make it seem like Bundy, at first, was a sloppy idiot. I admit that by the end of his killing spree his work became more sloppy, but to kill over 100 people and never be caught is a tribute to how smart and percise this animal was. Not to say I agree with anything he did, just that to make him seem like an idiot just makes the people that couldnt find him and keep their hands on him look stupid themselves."
4,"The Real ""American Psycho""","The scene where Bundy tells his girlfriend to ""play dead"" while they are in bed is truly shocking stuff and is worth the eight dollars by itself.The film ultimately succeeds for several factors.(1) An incredible performance by Michael Reilly Burke. Christian Bale in American Psycho was cartoonish. Burke plays Bundy as he was...a real person who had parts of his personality that were numingly normal and obviously the very evil and twisted parts of him as well.(2) The film is violent but it doesn't go over the top in terms of portraying the crimes in all of their grisly detail. As a result..it retains its objectivity and doesn't turn the film into and exploitation picture glamorizing the killer.(3) The film shows Bundy getting his come uppance and shows him for what he was..a coward who died crying and snivelling rather than going out with some dignity.This movie definately warrants viewing."
1,Serial Thieves -- on a Serial Killer,"While Bundy is still very interesting 11 years after his execution, this depiction is weak and lacking in depth and understanding of the kind of mind Bundy had. Much of the material -- even direct quotes -- are lifted from ""The Only Living Witness,"" the 1983 book written by two reporters who were the ONLY reporters to interview Bundy at length after his Florida murder spree. The subject still is interesting, but most (who understand) won't be interested in second-hand psychiatric babble interlaced with fact and semi-fact."
3,It's Alright Depending On Your Expectations,"Growman's review really hit the nail on the head here. Though this film centers around a real life murderer, it's NOT an insightful biopic. Sure, there are important scenes which really happened, but the movie only shows what it needs to in terms of reality. Lets face it, this film is B horror expoitation schlock, pure and simple. It's no different than the other direct to video B horror flicks like Junior or Cheerleader Massacre that are currently on the New Release wall. And really, you should view it as such, coz there isn't much of a message here only to see the horrible events from Ted Bundy's point of view. Maybe that was the point. I don't think so though. Burke's performance is creepy though."
3,watchable,THis movie wasn't that bad compared to the other serial killer flicks that have been made recently. Its better than Dahmer or Gacy. has some details but not all.I would have liked to seen more about his childhood. I still think its worth a look.
1,"That's OK I'd rather not see in graphic detail all of Mr. Bundy's sick ""jollies""","I should have read before buying this piece of""awful"". What a truly disgusting and ""base"" film this is. Worst than that it insults the memory of the girls that fell into this ""Monster's"" hands. I suspect had he not been executed for his crimes, this film would be palyed often in Bundy's cell."
2,Toooo cheesy!,When I ordered this I was expecting a gruesome horror flick. So much of the actual story was left out that this was hardly believable and the acting was corny to boot.
1,Not a good movie...,"I rented this movie expecting an accurate depiction of Bundy's life, as a serial killer and as a human. I got neither. I have studied Bundy extensively in school (I was a Sociology major at the University of Washington, where Bundy took Psychology classes, one of my professors was an investigator in the King County cases), and I was amazed how few facts there were.Not only that, but there were things in that movie that NO ONE should ever see, I can't believe someone would watch this as a director and think it looks like something someone should watch...The Deliberate Stranger with Mark Harmon is more accurate than this, this is just garbage."
4,Into A Madman's Mind...,"The first time I saw ""Ted Bundy"" on TV, I only watched about 20 minutes of it. This time around, I decided to give it a chance...I'm glad I did. Michael Reilly Burke offers a unique portrayal of one of America's most infamous serial killers in this 2002 film. He lacks the swarthy good looks and seductive appeal of Mark Harmon in ""The Deliberate Stranger"", but there is still something about him. We see his bouts of kleptomania and violent fits of rage. We see him leading his victims like lambs to the slaughter, a demonic Pied Piper. We see the madness and evil that lurks behind the facade of respectability. And at the end, we see what he probably was like in his final moments...a terrified little boy, stripped of his power. The execution brought his reign of terror to an end but I'm sure that the horror still lingers in the hearts and minds of the people who came into contact with him.I apologize for the potential spoiler, but the execution scene was pretty intense."
3,Fast forward review,"I was late getting to this film because I figured it would be lamo, but lo and behold they actually made a sleaze flick out of it, something rare in these Janet sunburst boob back to morality days.Anyway, we got several rambunctious Ted scenes clobbering screaming babes with tire irons and hunks of wood, lots of blood, and surprisingly a lot of nudity, even chasing around partially clad babes through the woods, something missing from the screen since the days of House on the Left, eh?Unfortunately, we also got several scenes marred by closeups of the straining Ted's face as he's humping, always objectional even in a porno loop, and several instances of flashing from nude babes to long ago dead nude babes, which edges the flick out of the sleaze category and into gore.So, 2 stars for the good parts, and an extra star just for daring to make something this nasty these days."
4,"""Hi, my name is Ted"" *insert gorilla noises here*","I myself have yet to see ""The Deliberate Stranger"", I can't compare it to ""Ted Bundy."" However, I did enjoy this movie. The crimes depicted in this movie showed the true heinous nature- there were NO holds barred. One cannot go in to watching a movie about Ted Bundy and expect rainbows and butterflies. I like how they showed how he verbally manipulated the girls before abducting him- it showed how Ted could be a charmer. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I wish they could've made it longer and a bit more in depth about aspects of Ted's life, like his childhood and involvement with Stephanie(the girlfriend who rejected him and is said to be the trigger of his crimes.) By leaving her out, I think they are leaving out a LOT of psychological explanation. I would've also liked to see more about his political involvement and how he could even charm and manipulate his friends.Overall, I love this movie. Michael Reilly Burke is amazing."
3,"Average, at best....","....and doesn't dramatize Bundy's trial, which is a key component of his sick saga. His execution and the lead-up to it is quite realistic, and to those who complain about how Bundy was treated - get a life. Personally, I think we worry far too much about the treatment of criminals and far too little about those they victimize. I was glad to see Ted get a little dose of what he so freely doled out to others prior to his execution.All in all, this movie is average. If you can get it cheap, watch it, if not, catch it for free on YouTube."
3,Well..........,"... the movie wasnt that bad. I think it was a little too upbeat and funny though. I;m thinkin the best part in the movie was the very beginning when he stood in front of the mirror practicing his ""Hello"" speech and making a bunch of incomprehensible noises. Now that was character.I also found it very amusing when Ted was applying lipstick to a severed head saying ""Soo pretty, yes you are"". His relationship with his girlfriend was sickening and perverse, as with his relationship with women in general. This movie failed in humanizing Ted Bundy, though it was pretty entertaining. ... Well, at least Michael Reilly Burke kinda SOUNDED like Ted Bundy. But this want not an effective movie, I didnt get anything from it. I felt no empathy at all for Bundy, I just think he's an even bigger monster than I originally thought."
3,Thank God for Florida and Old Sparky!,"Ted Bundy may of been likable, but he was still scum of the earth. I beg to differ in that this film showed him to be the ruthless thug that he was. I especially like the ending , where instead of the pity most films try project onto the condemmed. This film instead shows Ted to be the cowardly wimp that he was. Good Riddance is all I can say. A good solid film."
2,regarding Ted Bundy........,"I find the stories is pieces(story is useless) and it stress more on killings. The opening shots show that Ted bundy steals flower pots, television sets in a kind of expression and action which looks funny and the sex scene inside is more of less a 'push' and 'push' scene. The actor's script in this movie shows that the killer is a problematic or 'psycotic' person and at the end of the movie the killer was sentenced to death by electrocution. This movie is one of the lousy story based film which I've seen in theatres."
3,Every womans worst Nightmare!,"While the movie isn't as gory as expected being that it's made about Ted Bundy, it shows Bundy's slyness, it shows that he was a liar and a thief as well as a brutal murderer, though i don't think he would steal a topiary from the front of a nursery in broad daylight (a little exagerated)it does show him a pervert, following young girls home, watching them undress in their strangely open curtain-ed windows while he masterbates in bushes and nobody seems to care much except the guy on the second story of the building.This film is exaggerated in a comical sense of his excessive compulsive urges of thievary, no thief should follw his example in this movie, and it doesn't show enough of what actually happened except the 2 second constant bludgeoning of women which he may have done but i know he did alot more. Not good if you want some real gore.But it is interesting all in all watching him get away with murder and escape it over to murder some more!"
1,Utter tosh. Not worth even one star,This reminds me of the 'cold fusion' fiasco. The transmutation of elements in biological (or any other) systems would involves huge amounts of energy. As another reviewer wrote: E = mc^2. Transmutation results in a change of mass. This change of mass means that either a hell of lot of energy is either going to be given out or taken in.
1,"Ripped, Does not have a titanic model","This book when I got it is ripped, It does not have a titanic model, 1/5. Not what my son expected"
3,not really necessary,"The gate itself is nice but never once used the remote, wish I didn't spend the extra money."
3,Great Gate...Except For One Major Flaw,"We replaced a manual wood gate with the Evenflo because of the remote opening feature. For a few days, we loved the new gate, then began to notice that we'd hear a clicking noise and find the gate had opened itself. After joking about a Poltergeist in our home for a few days, we began to notice a link between using our Microwave and the door opening phenomenon.Although this explains most of the opening events, it also happens in the middle of the night sometimes, when no one is using the microwave. This could be a rare problem due to our particular power microwave and it's proximity to the gate (or a Poltergeist!), but it is a major flaw to it's usefulness to us."
5,so simple,I love this gate. you can push the button mounted to the wall with your shoulder or elbow if your arms and hands are occupied by a baby or laundry or whatever.
1,Fails to provide safety,This gate will not keep your children safe simply because it opens on it's own. Like others people who have reviewed this product our gate opened all the time even in the middle of the night. I'm in the midst of contacting evenflo and strongly suggesting that they recall the product before a child gets badly injured or worse.Do yourself and your children a favor and stay clear of this gate.
5,Nancy Drew- Treasure in the Royal Tower,My friend and I own all of the other Nancy Drew games and want to buy number 5 when it comes out. We've played all of them and they're all fun but this one is the most fun because there are so many places to go and so many riddles/puzzles to solve. There are also lots and lots of places to explore. This game is so good it deserves 5 stars so thats what I rated it!
5,Nancy Drew Cracks Another,I loved playing this game sooooooo much!!!!! I have all of the other Nancy Drew games but this was the best!!!!!!
5,wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this was my first one to solve and i loved it i enjoyed being a bellhop for professor hotchkis or whoever she was and everyone there will lighted up and be pleasant once you start helping them and figure out the mystery of the vandalized library. and there are hidden secrets about everyone there once you open every door and read every book. plus check out that elevator ceiling that's your only way into the library but careful for people ""checking"" on the library and listen to everything because professor hotchkis is most helpful she knows the resorts history!!good luck!!!!"
5,Great mystery solving opportunity,"I am a a29 year old mom, who's been a Nancy Drew fan forever. My 7 year old son and I can sit for hours trying to figure out the clues, and find our way down the secret passages. This game is the most fun I've had in a long time, and is a must, not just for girl sleuths, but for boys and grown up Nancy Drew fans alike. It really makes those pages of the popular books come to life, and I'm hoping I get another title for my birthday!"
4,Treasure in the Royal Tower by Lindsey Allen,This game was great and very informatic(just a minute <tiny> bit). I would reccomed this game for people who would like an easy game that you could finish in between one and two days.I give this game an A- .
5,FABULOUS!,Playing Treasure in the Royal Tower marked one of the most exciting moments of my life. I also got a tingle of excitement when playing Final Scene and Message in a Haunted Mansion. I had always wanted a computer game like this and here it is!!!
3,My hand is still aching from traipsing all over the castle,"This is the weakest of the Nancy Drew, Her Interactive Series. After playing Message in a Haunted Mansion I had high hopes for thrills and chills in The Royal Tower, however there was little excitement to be found in this game. The castle was far too spread out. Three full floors of dull hallways to walk through in order to search for clues; left my mouse hand feeling numb, and my detective instincts feeling bored. Hey, I know its a castle and has to be on the large side, but for crying out loud, jauntering about from one floor to another, up and down staircases, over and over just left me more frustrated than anything else. If you want to maximize your Nancy Drew fun, check out Message in a Haunted Mansion or Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake. Both of these titles have a better pace, and creepier feel."
3,Pretty good,My only problem with this game was that it was more of a history lesson than a game. You have to read a lot of textbooks. But the castle was really cool and the people were friendly and it had a really good twist ending. Good graphics too.
3,A bit of a disapointment,"I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING THIS GAME AFTER READING SOME OF THE REVIEWS, IT SEEMED TO HAVE ALL THE INGREDIENTS OF A GREAT MYSTERY.ALTHOUGH THE GAME HAD THE POTENTIAL TO EXPAND TO A GREAT EVOLVING SUSPENCE, I FELT IT DID NOT FULLY TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY. THE RESULTS WERE IN MY OPINION, FLAT CHARACTERS WHO'S PERSONALITYS BEG TO BE WOKEN UP, A LACK OF EXPLORATION INTO THE MANY ROOMS IN THE GAME, IE DEXTERS ROOM , JAQUES ROOM ETC YOU I FELT AS THOUGH I WAS PLAYING ONLY HALF A GAME.THEN IT ALL ENDS TOO QUICKLY FOR THE PRICE. I CERTAINLY WAS LEFT FEELING IS THAT IT. I HAVE NOW PLAYED ALL THE NANCY DREW GAMES , THEY ARE NICE BUT TOO SHORT IF YOUR HOPING IT WILL SEE YOU THROUGH THE FESTIVE SEASON."
4,I loved this game,"My Dad bought this game for my sister and I about 5 years ago. The three of us played it together and LOVED IT!We wanted something that was relatively simple to get the hang of but had challenging puzzles and things to solve. We'd stay up well past our bedtime, just so we could get to the next section.Thoroughly well recommended!"
5,Treasure in the Royal Tower,"This was a really fun game! In this fourth game, Nancy is in Wisconsin taking a vacation at a ski lodge which happens to be a huge, ancient castle! She finds out about a long-lost secret, (which you can find out for yourself) that someone else in the castle is trying to find also, but with desperate measures. I loved exploring the castle, it was so much fun and exciting. You basically stay in the castle the whole game, but you can also go outside on the grounds. The game was so exciting. I loved it!"
4,Nancy Drew Treasure in the Royal Tower,"Game is fun and interesting. The graphics are a little dated since it was one of the early games. Overall, I liked the story line and it was entertaining. People new to the Nancy Drew games might like to play this one first."
4,Nancy Drew Treasure in the Royal Tower,"When a blizzard ruins your vacation, you are stuck in Wickford Castle in Wisconsin. But you don't get to relax much on that trip, because another mystery turns up! The castle holds many passageways, conataining many historical artifacts. Marie Antoinette may even have hid her famous diamond somewhere in the Royal Tower...This game was a ton of fun! The puzzles were not so easy, but not too hard either. The plot was wonderful and mysterious at the same time. It was not the best Nancy Drew Game I've played, but it was definitely worth playing."
4,Listen to this album a few times with an open mind,"After my first listening of 'Cry' I was disappointed. It did not sound anything like 'New Gold Dream' or 'Sparkle in the Rain' (which I think we all secretly hope their albums will sound like). But after listening to 'Cry' for the past three weeks or so I found that I really like it for what it is. The songs are all catchy as I find myself singing a different one in my mind during the day when I am not listening to it. The songs are different (as opposed to 'She's a River' where they all sounded alike) and well written. 'Cry' is more of a laid back, easy listening album (as opposed to NGD and SITR which were tense and energetic). It looks like Jim Kerr gave a good effort on this one (It is interesting that Charlie Burchill did not assist in writing the songs). I am really enjoying this one."
3,still don't know what to make of this CD.....,"Well,I bought this CD a few months ago,listened to it over & over,and still trying to stomach the contents.To be honest,I'm still having a hard go of it trying to accept this new sound they seem to be toying with.The sounds may be SM's attempt to return to the dance tunes of the early 80's-before New Gold Dream-I don't know.It sure is a kind of contrast to material from Sparkle in The Rain,and Once Upon a Time(sorry folks...I have very high preference for the SM of the 80's!).One thing for sure,I kinda like songs such as ""One Step Closer"" & ""Sleeping Girl""(which has that new-wave kind of feel to it)and the softer,acoustic version of ""Cry""(called ""Cry Again"").What I dislike is the final track(I forgot the title of it),and ""Disconnected"".The others,I'm neutral on.All in all,a somewhat fine piece of work,if only they would just stick to the awesome charismatic musical power that got them the acclaim back in the mid 80's."
2,CritterTrail Outhouse,"Its an okay item, litter breaks down to sand, doesn't clump well, and will not attach to every expandable cage so don't assume it will or try to force it because i did, and my hamster escaped last night from it. but it does have a nice secure lid. over all find something better."
2,Doesn't work.,"My two gerbils were very young when I got this (you know how the say you can't teach and old dog new tricks), and it still didn't work. My gerbils just piled litter in there to the brim at first. Now I put some in there already and they use it as a lookout bedroom kind of thing which is OK; it doesn't work as far as training them to go potty in there but it's cool to see them sleeping in there or whatever. Maybe other people will have better luck with it than I did."
3,Hamster didnt fit in it,"Our hamster is a brown bear hamster and he didnt fit in this, he could get in but couldnt turn around, so he doesnt ever bother to try to use it"
2,Look for others,Not happy with the construction. The very first time I disconnected each one to clean them the round connector cracked along the bottom. Lots of glue later they work and are easy to clean out with the flip top.
2,Outhouse,"Great if you have just one hamster and have the time to get them trained. With two hamsters, pretty useless as they mark their space so they won't use it."
2,its a great ballet but missing a lot of pantamime parts....,"This ballet is quite grand in that La Bayadere is a story of a Bayadere which is a temple dancer who is named Nikiya not Nikita(hense not La Femme), this ballet is quite beautiful with the wonderful Darcey Bussell, a grand prima ballerina. Despite the length of the ballet, its only like about 3/4 of the original of the actual story, the Choreography by Natalia Makarova is quite beautiful but none compared to the Original Marius Petipa movements and the music is fairly glitzy. thats just my opinion."
3,What is the lost last act?,"I have the Kultur Bolshoi version. What is this 'lost last act'? Is it missing from mine?I am undecided whether to buy this version because of the pervious reviews.Disregard the rating. The website insisted on a rating but as I have not seen this version, I am unable to rate it."
4,Great video,My son loves all the (3) videos. I would recommend all of them to family and friends. Cool graphics too.
4,"Stimulating, despite insufficient editing of lecture texts.","Irwin's award winning book is a stimulating application ofnow traditional 'new' literary criticism/analysis and more recent andtrendy (read: quasi-post-modern) devices.The result is a frequently absorbingstudy of the labyrinthine minds of Poe and Borges,as seen principally through their related six detectivepieces.Unfortunately the sutures as well as the strivings-for-effect from Irwin's foundationallectures stand too proud, making for greater appeal to academicsthan to even highly motivated general readers.Irwin's work would find and deserve more cover-to-coverreaders, rather than citation researchers, if asecond edition were edited for repetitiveness andprolixity."
2,Contains Sulphur,"I am allergic to sulphur and started taking Milk Thistle. I didn't know that it was high in sulphur. I stared to get bumps on my fingers and swelling. I realized something was wrong. When I looked up more I discovered it is high in sulphur. Just a warning. If you are not allergic go ahead and take it, I think it helped."
3,Well it was doing something,"I don't know what effect it actually had on my liver, but it did make my stomach cramp up a lot. I really couldn't take this for more than a couple weeks. Of course the price on amazon beats any store though."
3,Not sure this is the best approach,"This product sits on your toilet seat instead of being a self contained potty chair. I'm still not sure if this approach is the best. Potty chairs are lower to the ground and may be easier for the child to accept. My twin boys seem a bit apprehensive, almost scared, when on this toilet seat reducer. It's been a slow go training them and I think most of it is just the fear of them being so high up and wanting to hold on to me or my wife while they try to go."
5,Potty training complete!,"We tried 2 other toilet reducer seats before this one and this duck seat is by far the best: sturdy, fits in normal and larger/oval-shaped toilets, and comfortable for our son. We also like that it has the loop at the end - we hung a hook on the wall for it. Overall, a star!"
5,"High deflector for boys, Stable, adjustable...Perfect","Perfect for every need. I adjusted the pins to fit snug on the toilet. My 2 year old can put it on, sit on by himself (with a step stool), and remove it after each use. Same great features as Bjorn, almost half the price! Duck is good entertainment while waiting to ""go"". Easy to clean with Clorex Wipes as well. No buyers remorse. It's just perfect."
3,Didn't fit my toilet,"seems great until i tried to fit it on my toilet. It was too big and sat on top of the lid on the back which meant there was a gap about the perfect size to pinch a toddler's fingers all around the sides of the ducka seat. I was very hopeful this would work. Sad to say, I'm disappointed."
3,Does not fit on Toto toilets,"Amazon is forcing me to give this product a rating. This is more of a comment for others who have Toto toilets. I did not use the product so the rating is not fair. Plus, I really wanted it to work on my Toto toilets.It absolutely does not work with Toto toilet seats: Both round and elongated. The product itself is cute and my kids were in love with the duck. I was sorry to have to tell them that it was going back to Amazon.Update: I found a seat that would fit the elongated (but not the round) Toto toilet seat:Prince Lionheart weePOD Toilet Trainer, Blue"
4,Not great on my elongated toilet seat..otherwise 5 stars,"After checking stores and several websites for different ""potty chairs"" and ""seat reducers"". I decided on the Ducka Seat Reducer, but was hesitant because the girl is so little (2 1/2 and 22 lbs) her rear slips into standard potty seats. The minute the mail delivered it she had to try it out. It didn't fit on the oblong seat itself which is a Westport Elongated, but it does fit perfectly on the bowl with no slippage. She fits it comfortably (no sliding in) and she loves using it making training easier. I notice it's a bit tricky getting on it over the ducks head, but she doesn't really seem to mind (a boy might). I really like that it hangs on the wall out of the way, and it cleans up easily.Downfalls: The eyes are just stickers that she tries to peel off and that distracts her from her ""business"". Also now she doesn't like to use the standard potty chair at her Mom & Dads, she wants to ""potty with duck""."
5,Best seat for a boy I have found,"The most important part of the whole seat is the ducks head and the slope down around the duck's feet. This provides a true barrier for preventing little boys from peeing over the seat onto the floor in front of the toilet when sitting. Other seats have the raised part in front of the seat, but becuase the legs are not any lower their penis can point straight out and sent pee over the small barrier.This was the thrid seat that I tried for a potty training boy. This seat is easy enough for him to take on and off by himself, and secure enough when on that he can climb on by himself. He did use a step to get on at the start, but a year later he still uses it but with out the use of a step."
5,The way it sounded on the radio,Now this is how it sounded when I was listening to it while cruising up or down Lake Shore Drive during my high school years. It went well with Aliota Hanes and Jeremiah's song titled Lake Shore Drive. Ah those were the days....
5,this cd kicks,"this cd is creative, and has a very unique sound to it. i was impressed by it's content , and i hope they come out with another album that is like this one very soon."
1,Inaccurate depiction of Mary,"I have allowed my five year old son to watch most of the Beginner's Bible Series videos and most of them are very good. However, this one does not get a good rating from me because as a Catholic who reveres (not worship) Mary the Blessed Mother I cannot accept big hoop earrings and the subtle innuendoes that she was not much different than other women of her time."
1,Stop: not a high capacity battery at all,"The item is described as ""high capacity"" battery. The picture(s) show a battery rated at 1300 mah which reinforces the high capacity claim. The battery received was only a 330 mah battery which is less than the 340 mah original. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM AS IT IS NOT WHAT IS PICTURED."
1,"Low quality, gets really hot when charging.","It should be noted that replacing the battery voids your warranty, but chances are, if you're buying it now, the warranty has long expired. It should be also noted that replacing your iPod nano (1st gen) battery does require soldering skills. I suggest you practice before proceeding.I was hoping to squeeze out a few more months out of my nano, but I guess that was wishful thinking. This battery is quite low-quality. When I installed it into my iPod nano, it got extremely hot. I double checked the wiring, so I was sure that I had installed it correctly. I doubt it even charged.It's a low-cost repair, but your results may vary."
2,pictured was a 1100 mah battery,I needed a battery with at least a 800 mah and the picture shower higher with the Dimensions I needed what came was not what was shown
1,"incompatible, dont buy",it will work for five minutes and your ipod wont turn on until you put the original battery in it. it has 4 times the power
4,As advertised,"This battery replacement pack is exactly as advertised. A bit of work to put it in, but if you can do that then it will work very well. My Nano has been saved!"
5,"After two years, still working strong","I bought one of these about two years ago. The plastic ipod opener things broke and I had to use a small screwdriver to pry open my first gen nano, which scratched it a bit. But heck, it's four years old and doesn't have the appearance of new any longer anyway.The battery still works great. I get good battery life still (comparable to my original battery when near new) after one year. For the price, it can't be beat!"
5,Simple if you know what you are doing,"Took 10 minutes and my Ipod is back in business. Use a soldering iron, cut the wire close to the old battery, melt the insulation to expose as much wire as you need, twist, solder, tape, and close. Make sure to align the hold button before closing the case. Battery holds a great charge so far! Just ordered another for second Ipod."
2,no Battery,We installed the eatery it worked for a few days whit one hour charge. Then after a couple of weeks the iPod stopped working. I don't know if is an apple thing or the battery is not good. But the fix did not work at all.
3,Cheap Tools Broke but Good Price,"Not for People with big hands and fingers!!! Battery 5 stars, Tools 1 star.The tools broke in the first 2 minutes. I had to use a fruit paring knife to finish the job of opening the iPod. The plastic ""tips"" shaved off when I attempted to move the tool around the iPod to pop the clips. I used my old Weller soldering gun (with a magnifying glass) and it was a snap. I can't imagine how anyone could cut and splice these wires!!! WARNING: Older far sighted people with big fingers will be very challenged without a very bright light, tweezers, and a magnifying glass/stand... Good Luck!"
2,Unacceptable,"I recently purchased this battery for my nano. When I got the battery, it came with cheap plastic tools used to open the ipod. The tools broke while I was trying to open the back. It took me over 20 mins to finally open the back metal part with a tiny screwdriver that I had. Soldering the battery in was a challenge. I wouldn't suggest doing this unless you have good technology skills. The battery held a charge for about a week, but it wouldn't hold a charge at all. I'm terribly unsatisfied at this product."
2,Replacement Battery,"The product worked for about a week before it stopped holding a charge. It is possible that the wires came apart, or loosened. I wasn't all that convinced after I finished the ""easy"" step by step instructions. It wasn't worth my time and energy to try and pry the iPod case open again and re-solder the smallest wires known to man."
2,remember to have four hands and a soldering gun,"This was an option for me, as I am always willing to go through a little bit of a headache to save some money. The price was right, compared to the cost of getting apple to do the deed. However, I was disappointed because I personally don't own a soldering gun and I don't have four hands. Luckily, a friend at work decided to help me, and he had a pair of hands and a soldering gun for me to borrow. The other problem was the size of the area to work in. It's impossible to see really well unless you're 18 and have perfect eyesight. We used a magnifying glass. The only other thing that was really hard to do was open the ipod nano case (first generation). I would recommend the fee to send the thing back to Apple and have it done by the people who made it..."
4,Before you buy:,"Excellent if you have the means and guts to do it yourself.Before you buy:You'll need an iron soldering with a very very sharp, thin headYou'll need solderYou'll need a magnifing glassYou'll need some skillIf you do have all this things or are accesible to you, then you can do it yourself (search youtube, how to replace an ipod nano battery, everything you need to know, and how to do it, is there)Since i dont have all this, i took the battery to an electronic repair shop and they changed the battery in 20 minutes (its a very meticulous job). After this, my ipod came back to life again. Notice that i had to take the ipod + battery to 4 or 5 repair shops before i found one that could get the job done, some wouldn't do it because they were afraid to mess my ipod up, some because they didn't have the right tools."
2,you get what you pay for,"easy to install if you have all the right tools and skill , but once put in it only last about 6 hours on a full charge with or with out using the ipod i would have to charge it ever night to have any charge !"
4,An unappreciated airplane,"This book does a fine job of revealing the story of an airplane that has been largely forgotten. It suffered through many modifications and was called many less than complimentary names by her crews, but when everything was said and done she accomplished her missions as well or better than many of her compatriots. In the end she even lost her B26 designation to another airplane. A fascinating story you shouldn't miss."
1,Junk,"I stopped watching after about 15 minutes. This is junk, the people talking were terrible, the acting was lousy, and the story (from what you could tell in the first 15 minutes anyways) didn't seem that great either. I'm glad I only paid $2 for it."
4,With a title like this...,"you don't think you can go wrong, which may be true. That all depends on your needs in a good Japanese film. First of all, the movie is not that violent, but to me, and maybe many of you, it was still pretty good. Te ending brough up a few complaints, becasue not much gets resolved, seriously, but it does set up for the sequel which is also good. If you like Riki or are a fan of the genre, try it out, and don't build it up too much."
2,Beware - this is not the version you are familiar with!,"Yes, it's the Grinch, but an old one. No songs, jerky animation etc. This is an old version of the Grinch who stole Christmas; not the one that you are probably familiar with that is regularly shown on TV. Just a heads up!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS VERSION!,This is NOT the one!This is more horrible than home video and is so poorly done it should be removed from circulation as it confuses the buyer into thinking it is the cassic animated video. You will be sorry if you buy this! Get the other one.
1,Not what it appears to be.,"This video is not the classice animated feature. It is a collection of still photos, captured on video, with a voice over."
1,Terrible!,This movie is awful. I purchased this instead of the animated version and was very disappointed. This tape is very bad. If you purchase this you will be stuck with a video you do not like and will never watch. I know I am.
1,THIS IS NOT THE FULL MOVIE!,"I ordered this and was very dissapointed to find I had ordered the wrong one. This is a reading of the book by Walter Matthau. This would be a good selection for younger children due to the easy to follow reading and not too complex images. My son was very entertained, but my wife and I got a headache... Merry Christmas."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"As the other reviews have stated, this is not the version you want. It is photographs of the storybook, not the animated characters you remember. There is no way to tell until you open it and watch it. It is terrible."
2,THIS IS NOT THE TV PROGRAM!!,"If you are wishing to buy the Grinch we all know and love from the TV program DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! I bought this by mistake (as others have) and I give it 2 stars just because it is original Seuss. It put the whole family to sleep! What a snore ZZZZZZZ."
1,NOT the Cartoon!,"What a scam! I think they HAD to know the the overwhelming majority of people would pick this DVD up in the store, and think it was the original animated Grinch. Why in the world would I want to buy a DVD of someone reading a book?"
1,WARNING - DON'T BUY ... not the movie you expect,This is just still pictures of the book pages ... with Walter Matthau reading the text. BORING! Definitely not the old animated TV movie I expected.
1,!!!!!!!DON`T BUY THIS VIDEO!!!!!!!!,***THIS IS NOT THE GRINCH WE HAVE ALL SEEN ON TV AND PROBABLY ACTUALLY THOUGHT WE WERE ORDERING. READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE YOU BUY.***
1,wish I had seen these comments before I purchased,"I agree with all the folks here saying what a drag this product is. I bought it on the fly in a brick-and-mortar store to put inside my son's Christmas stocking. I was expecting the children's classic animated short movie, but was most chagrined to find our family watching a screen scan the pages of the book with an actor reading the lines. Why would I want this when I can read the book to him myself in person? I must say this product embodies false advertising - with the result being quite the Christmas spoiler. What a lame gift - here we were expecting to share a great, fun part of our own childhood holidays and instead got a 30-minute video reading of the book. I wish I could return it, but can't since it is already opened and viewed! This is the tale of ""How SONY (the manufacturer) Stole Christmas""!"
2,A sullen film,"They are indeed asleep. A widower of 15 years seeks solace in their unconscious company. He lies beside the beauty selected for him. He touches, caresses and occasionally kisses, while reflecting on his life and the prospect of death. There is nakedness but no eroticism. The touching and caressing (for which he is paying) seems like a form of tactile therapy. The madam muses openly, `he is a man not at peace with himself'; a confirmation of the therapeutic benefits of this arrangement perhaps. The reason for each girl's sleeping is revealed. If you are in the mood for an essentially sullen film then this is for you. It is, in essence, a prolonged conversation. It's much too clever for me to understand. Others might simply call it weird.Ian Hunter.Author of `e-Love'."
1,An erotic misadventure,"There were several questions that entered my mind, when I watched this movie,the number one was, who in the right mind green lights these projects.This movie is about a lonely old man, Vadim Glowna, who also happen to be the director. His wife has recently deceased and is suggested to visit a place for therapeutic reasons by his friend. Most of the movie is about him in this place, sleeping next to a bevy of sleepy young naked women and having conversations with them. You get glimpses of his life through these conversations but none that reveal anything that can keep you engaged.I researched this movie and I found that it is based on a short story by Japan's Nobel laureate Kawabata and such a place did exist in Berlin. I watched this movie because the NY Post gave it a high rating. I hated this movie, it is boring and pretentious. If there was a less than one star rating, this movie would have earned it hands down....."
3,"AN OKAY ALEXANDER O'NEAL CD , BUT IT'S JUST NOT PERFECT!","first off, i'm a huge o'neal fan. the man can sing! but this album is missing jimmy jam and terry lewis' amazing song-writing skills and super-tight smooth production! alex, by himself, is like a plate of lip-smacking bbq ribs. yet, if you add jimmy jam and terry lewis to alex's husky voice, it's like a tasty soulfood buffett for 5 million and counting.still, this album is a must-have just to hear the songs LOVE MAKES NO SENSE, IF YOU LET IT, AFRODESIA, and IN THE MIDDLE! so, get this album just to add onto your personal cd/mp3 collection of alex's body of impressive work!...""now, fellas! ...can i get you to put your hands together for that?""-ALEXANDER O'NEAL, from the song, ""FAKE!"""
5,Classic R&B,"As a fan of Alexander O'neal I'm so glad to have found this cd on Amazon, I bought it for the song In The Middle, it's a great up tempo dance song, the rest of the cd is nice also, very smoothe soulful voice."
2,not what I expected,"This product does not fit very snuggly on my hand, therefore provides little support. I do have small hands and ordered a small but could really have used an extra small if that size was available."
3,Not sure it helps at all...,It's really thin and seems too light to really do anything. I used it a few times when my hand gets sore from crafts or computer use and it's mediocre. I rather use the sturdier wrist wraps or tape so you can adjust the fit.
1,Handeze,"This was the wrong product and has been returned. Still waiting for confirmation and credit on account and once credit is received, replacement item will be ordered."
2,Unhappy fingers,I bought this item as I am on the computer all day and my hand gets really cold and achy. I thought that it would help my fingers warm up but that did not happen at all. They still got as cold even with the glove on.
1,Not Sure What They're Thinking,"This product is like putting your hand in a sock.It's pretty much pointless. It's all loose; butsince it's cut off at the fingers, you won't haveto worry about over heating I guess. Actuallyusing a sock might be better as you couldmake a cute puppet and entertain yourself.Seriously, the box looks sharp, but it'sone of those times when the box is moresubstantial than what's in it."
1,Ridiculous,"I have been experiencing increasing wrist pain over the past couple of months, and decided that I needed to do something to head off carpal tunnel or some such thing at the pass. So I ordered this product thinking that it would offer some support and, perhaps, alleviate some of the pain in my wrist. Ha! This ""glove"" couldn't do any of that. I bought the smallest glove possible and to say it was ""form fitting"" would be a joke. There was no ""compression"" and no ""support"" offered by this product. I had the same amount of movement in my wrist whether I wore it or not. Also, the heating and massage element of this product is practically nonexistent. I was very disappointed in the Handeze glove and felt that it claimed to help with more symptoms then it could ever hope to and that it grossly exaggerated the beneficial aspects of the product. I ended up going out buying another support to help. Overall, it is my opinion that if you buy this product you will be wasting your money."
4,Hot Champaign Music,"Champaign, IL has been blessed with the outstanding band ""Beezus."" Unfortunately the women of this ""chick band"" have parted their ways. One great way to capture some of their great music is by listening to this album. The songs are fantastic. Their cover of ""Rebel Girl"" is outstanding. The lyrics in ""Keeper"" really capture their feminist theme in many of their songs. If you enjoy this album, try to locate Beezus's first album...it's a little better than this album, but it's a tough call when you're comparing great with outstanding."
3,Good,"I liked very much my Le Chateau but when I received it, it was not working and I have to change the battery."
5,Screw Publisher's Weekly,"This is my favorite of all the Heinlein novels I have read. Far from being a story of debauchery and helpless characters, it is both a wonderful scifi novel and an exploration in open-mindedness. The sexual attitudes represented here are refreshing in their non-conformity, and yet completely logically reasoned out. Maureen is a wonderfully real character with flaws and aspirations to delight any reader. Our favorite scifi kitty Pixel also makes an appearence.This is one of those books that I will read over and over again, and it will hold a place amongst my favorite scifi novels for a long time."
3,"Great novel, no dust jacket at all, cover was faded and stained","Book sold as good but I would have rated it Average, at best. Not a nice copy. Boards are bent as well."
1,"Ruined ""Time Enough For Love"" for me....","""Time Enough For Love"" is one of my favourite Heinlein books. After reading this abomination...well, the ending story of Lazarus Long (Woodrow Wilson Smith) and his relationship with his mother ""Maureen"" and his family is ruined. The books protagonist Maureen Smith in ""To Sail Beyond the Sunset"" is a full blown skank. Her husband wants to sleep with his young daughter...Maureen says, ""That's wonderful"". Huh? what just happened here? Maureen sleeps with the ice man...heck, she seems to sleep with anyone who can benefit her even minimally.I gave up after half a book. A very disappointing skewing of characters I liked and no longer do."
1,Alzheimer's was definitely setting in,"Poorly written. I mean really, really bad. It is evident to me he couldn't carry a coherent train of thought, just rambled onto the page, and very occasionally inserted a touch of sci-fi to keep his long term readers happy. Mostly an ode to the world as he would have liked it to have been, filled with endless sex and incest. I really like Heinlein, Stranger in a Strange Land is one of my all time favorites, but he is so far off his game here, it is quite painful to read. I really don't understand the 5 star ratings for this one, I would give it zero stars if that was an option."
3,Still Pretty Average,"This volume was a little bit better than the 1st. Kosei had a date with a pirate girl that fell in love with him. Things go much worse than expected, and the date turns out to be their last. Meifon Li also has a date that also turns out to be a disaster. The characters are developed a bit, and the plot thickens. Other than those things, Angel Links continues to to be mediocre. I am enjoying myself, but I can't give it 4 stars b/c it is a disappointment. Comparing it to Outlaw Star isn't really fair, but if that's gonna be the animes selling point, That's what I'm gonna do. Meifon Li's awesome looks, and her fun personality continue to be the best part of this series."
3,Angel Links is getting better,"I reviewed Angel Links Vol. 1 Before and here is my review for vol. 2. I believe that the series is starting to get better as I watch each episode! The first episode deals more with Kosei who begins to fall for a pirate named Jesia who he meets after a battle. The next two episode deals with Mefion and more of her past. We learn more of her grandfather and how she came to be a pirate fighter. We also learn more about Lem Lou, but I will not go any further as I do not with to ruin it for anyone who does decide to buy, rent or borrow this dvd. I gave it 3 stars in this review, but I actually wish to give it 3 and 1/2 stars but the review system won't let me."
1,BAD BAD BAD BAD MOVIE Angel links volume 2,Good movie if you like kinky angels running around naked and sinning but otherwise WHERE'S THE F***ING PLOT! NO ACTUAL CHARACTER AND NO COOL FIGHT SCENES. Besides even when they are nued there still to kinky!
2,Alcohol Helped In At Least One Case,"I stumbled across this book, priced to sell, at a nearby Half Price Book Store, and they had several copies. The author is harsh with John Steinbeck, who definitely did drink (and who mentioned severe hangovers in the journal he kept while writing East of Eden).However, Steinbeck's descriptions of Doc's relationship with beer in Cannery Row were right on target -- likely inspired by real life -- and you couldn't turn more than five pages of that fine little book without craving to pop a cold one."
5,Useful intro to comparative politics research,"There are a lot of books about social science research. This one still has value, even after 40 years. I like that it has multiple scholars contributing their perspectives. This book does a good job laying out various strategies for research design. It isn't filled with a bunch of dumbed-down examples about abstract logic, but rather explains what types of comparisons are useful for testing alternative theories."
1,Cheaper at Costco,This machine is just marginally OK for advertised functions and it is usually available at Costco for much less! Why pay full-price for second-rate machine?
2,Saeco Magic Deluxe,"I bought one of these last fall and have had reasonably good results until a few weeks ago. The grinder has ceased to put coffee into the system for brewing, resulting in a ""bean out"" warning light even when the hopper is full. Now I grind the coffee and use the bypass chute to make coffee - less than ""SuperAutomatic"". I am finding that the system sometimes simply dumps the coffee grounds without making a cup of coffee for no apparent reason.My wife also dislikes the positioning of the steaming wand; it should be on the side with a greater separation from the body of the machine.I sent an email to Saeco's US Warranty station a week ago asking about a fix for this problem and have heard nothing. If there is no support for the product, it is not worth buying, even at a good price.Caveat Emptor"
3,great machine -- poor repair service,"We had this machine and loved it until it started leaking all over the place. We sent it in for repair assuming that all parts were covered under the 1 year factory warranty. Apparently not. [$$$] repair costs already charged to our credit card and 3 months later, we still have not had our espresso machine returned to us by Saeco."
2,Service Problems,"I purchased the unit in January '02 and started to leak water after about 8 months. I had to call the customer service department repeatedly to get a return authorization number. I was informed that it would take approximatley 4 weeks to repair the unit even if it was under warranty. By the time they called with the RMA, I had already returned the unit. The machine is easy enough to use, but I question the reliability. I was also very disappointed with their customer service."
2,coffee/cappuccino making,"be aware that a machine with one boiler will become a problem if you want to make an espresso, froth the milk and want to go back to making an espresso. you will have to wait until the machine cools down which is a PITA!Invest in a machine which has two boilers one for the espresso and the other for the frothing of milk etc."
2,Service?,In a nutshell...........makes good coffee while it works.Customer service is none existing. If you have a problem it willtake half a day on the phone and then 4-8 weeks to get it fixed.They really don't seem to back the product. Suprised Amazon is pushing the product.
5,Emma's Birthday,I had such a great experience with this order. My grandaughter loved the book. The person I dealt with was wonderful. So efficent and nice.Thank you for the very good experience.Vickie Simpson
1,re-bof !,"Pour la seconde fois et pour les mmes raisons, je suis très déue de cette réception :- le coffret était cassé- il manquait la jaquette et (éventuellement) le livret.Est-il possible de la recevoir ?"
3,this is so wonderful,Pas de Tot is so fun and I love it. It means step of the. The tot little child. I was dancer in New city. I am back now after while. A little
5,Fat Lady of Limbourg still is the best,"This is the definitive Eno album. But don't be confused. Even though this is catchier at first listen, Taking Tiger Mountain by strategy is the best by far!"
2,Brian Eno - Father of Indie,"Although this album pretty much started the Indie music genre that we know today, it just really isn't, umm, ANY GOOD! Eno's songs are quirky, musical, and innovative...but they simply aren't very enjoyable.However, if you ARE into Indie, you will probably like the album...Just be mindful that Brian Eno is a ""musician's musician."" (If you've never heard that term before, then you DEFINATELY won't like this album.)"
4,Baby's Still Smokin',"Don't worry about this album sounding dated - the pop mainstream has yet to catch up to it, or any of Eno's other 70s albums. As a bonus, ""Baby's on Fire"" contains one of Robert Fripp's best and most vicious guitar solos."
4,Here Come the Warm Jets,"Here Come the Warm Jets being Eno's debut solo album and his 1973 release was both a critical as well as a commercial at the time of its release. The album peaked at #26 in the UK album charts. Songs that standout on this release are ""Some of them are Old"" and ""Cyndy Tells me"". The booklet is strange with a cover that looks like a friend made that photograph. No lyrics are included but we do get a nice list of whom plays what on the album. It sounds very experimental and sounds a bit like a mix between experimental music and rock. 4/5."
5,"Great record, great seller!","This is a great record, and the seller provided awesome service. Would definately buy from her again!"
5,Classic album but buy the remastered edition,"""Here Comes the Warm Jets"" stands as one of Eno's best solo albums. Later he would venture into more ambient territory but here Eno rocks out with a vengence. ""Baby's on Fire"" with Fripp's stuttering guitar solo is one of the stand out breaks. While Eno never had a great voice, he does a pretty good job overall singing the material. His singing improved greatly with each successive album.Although the remastered/reissued edition doesn't have any bonus tracks, I'd recommend it over this edition. The DSD remastered sound captures much more detail, depth and, well, ambience than the originally issued CD. This isn't a bad mastering job, it's just dated sounding compared to more recent reissues."
5,a very funny record,"A terrific record - definitely groundbreaking, probably influential (it sure influenced me), and extremely funny both lyrically and musically (check the spot-on Bryan Ferry impersonation in ""Dead Finks Don't Talk,"" the lyrics of ""Paw-Paw Negro Blowtorch,"" or the sound of robot chipmunks in heat during the instrumental break of same).The new remaster marginally improves the sound of the original CD release (to my ears, anyway), though the tinny, early-70's studio sound is still very much in evidence. For some reason the LP cover was butchered on the original CD (bad cropping job) but for the remaster Virgin has restored the original sleeve illustration to its full, weird glory."
5,Elmo in Grouchland (Sing & Play),"My 18-month old son is a huge Elmo fan, and this is hisfavorite Elmo video so far. The video is almost non-stop music, andthe catchy tunes will have even the parents singing along (""Elmo's best friiieeend!"") There is a bonus ""Elmo's World"" at the end of the video, featuring a version not seen on TV. It is all about balls, which happens to be my son's second favorite subject after Elmo! I definitely recommend buying this video. END"
4,GREAT VIDEO FOR ELMO FANS,"I accidentally bought this movie in the store. I thought I was buying the movie-Elmo in Grouchland. It was a fortunate mistake. Like most sing alongs, this video has all the words to the songs across the bottom of the screen. Wonderful for pre reading toddlers. Also if your child likes Elmo's World on Sesame Street- the last 20 minutes of the video is Elmo's World on balls. My 18 month old LOVES it."
5,want to read it again..on my kindle. * hint hint nudge nudge*,If you like the ships from the Culture Novels this is the best read about them to date. I'd like to read it again soon on my Kindle.
4,Interesting book,"Interesting book with some really neat ideas.....it goes on a bit in places, as this author tends to, but the story is great and the sci-if in it all first rate."
4,Thoughts on Excession,Excession (Culture #5) is great story from an artificial intelligence and non-human perspective. It actually manages to feels alien yet understandable.
5,Fantastic! Ignore all pessimists and give it a shot!,"Excession is among the five best books I have ever read. This is the first of Ian Banks' books that I have read and I couldn't put it down. It does take a bit to become immersed in the plot but once there, it's absolutely fantastic. The ideas will stretch the limits of your mind and leave you with a new perspective on the universe."
1,Banks falls way short of his own high standards,"If you fancy reading a book full of conversations between computers which are written half in English and half in some meaningless gibberish concocted by the author after spending the night with a bottle of Scotch, then this is the book for you. Tedious, unfocussed, all-over-the place rubbish. Scarcely believeable that it was written by the same pen as the beautiful ""Consider Phlebas"" or even the highly effective ""Player of Games"". A big letdown."
2,Laboured,"Don't believe the puerile rubbish you read in other reviews ; this story (I will not credit it with the description ""novel"") wheezes along like the pot-boiler it is, in order that Banks can continue to lead his champagne socialist lifestyle, and bore everyone else rigid in doing so. If you're looking for imagination, you'll be better off with the Lion King video."
4,Nice book,"This is a very nice book, and, frankly, although I read them out of order, my first introduction to this universe. I am currently reading Player of Games."
1,Nothing happens!,"I have never written a review for a book before. But I feel it is necessary to warn people about this book. It starts interestingly, mysterious, and has a lot of different plot lines, and then...nothing EVER happens. Even when things get tense and you are certain that someone will do SOMETHING...it doesn't happen. All everyone does is talk a lot about what they would do if they were going to do anything...which they don't. So don't be fooled: there is NO action, NO plot, and NO direction to this book. So if you want a science fiction book where nothing happens and you are completely confused for hundreds of pages...you've found the right book to read!As has been said here before by many other reviewers of not good books: ""I would have given this book a ""0"" if they allowed it."
1,"The most tedious, fustrating book I have ever read.","This book is shockingly bad.There is no story, endless pages of nonsense, with descriptions which are quite franky tedious and childish.I had read The wasp factory and thought I would give the sci-fi side of Ian Banks a go.I read in the hope the book would improve, which took a year as I read several books in between desperate for a good story.The book did not improve.How the book has received so many good reviews reminded me of another story.The Emperor's New Clothes."
3,This book reads like it was written in three days.,"by a very intelligent and talented writer. I've loved every other Banks novel I've read, but this one was really carelessly written. Banks is capable of much more than this."
3,"Good beginning, long middle, no end","Banks' ""Culture Universe"" is definitely intriguing, the backdrop for potentially great stories such as ""Player of Games"". This book looks promising from the start, but then you realise that you're halfway through the book, and nothing much has happened. By the end, still nothing has happened. Missed opportunity for a good story."
4,No Hugos for Iain? No justice!,"Banks is easily the best science-fiction author to be repeatedly stiffed for its major awards, which makes no sense to me considering some of the mediocrities that have been so rewarded (David Brin, Orson Scott Card). As always, pay close attention or else, because Mr. Banks never panders to his readers. His books are dense, ambiguous, and laced with irony, and Excession is no exception to that rule. This is one of his more playful books, however, especially in the wordplay between the various Culture Minds who constitute the novel's main characters. Though Banks's Culture books need not be read in any particular order, I would not recommend this as an introduction to his universe-start instead with Player of Games or Consider Phlebas (if you can find them). Excession is best read in a few sittings-say, a nice weekend at the beach. Stretching it out over a period of weeks may cause one to lose track of the nuances, which are typically plentiful and worth catching."
3,Fascinating and frustrating,"I am a big fan of I.M Banks, but I had a hard time with this one. Most of the characters are ""Minds"", complete with their outrageous names, but there are too many of them and I had a hard time figuring out who was who (or what was what, to be accurate). The story is too convoluted for my tastes, and I never did truly grasp what was going on in places. Nonetheless, it also has some of his wonderful imageries and exciting situations that kept me going to the end."
3,Good fun,"Not one for Culture beginners, but a rollicking yarn for those already immersed. Can be a little hard to follow owing to the number of Minds that communicate and the plot is perhaps more than necessarily convoluted, but it builds to a thrilling climax."
4,"Nice universe, shame about the story","Reading Excession soon after 'Consider Phebas' amplified the disappointment I felt with this book. CP was a fast-paced, absorbing yarn set against a rich, detailed background. In Excession the background has become the book's central character. Whilst the Culture universe is fascinating it does not constitute a plot in itself.There is a comparison which comes to mind: The excellent Dune series which started with a fantastic story and ended as a political and sociological case study of a fictituous universe.It's as if Banks, like Herbert - Dune's creator, has become more interested in creating a cerebral word than telling the stories which occur in it."
2,"All skin, no meat","I found Excession a disappointing, if entertaining, read. I've read two of his other Culture novels -- Player of Games and Consider Phelbas -- and found them both intriguing and thought-provoking. Excession, however, has no real main plot but a thousand sub-plots that lead nowhere, serve no clear purpose, and end with a colossally boring anticlimax. All I got from this book was a renewed sense of loathing for the Culture (I've loved to hate them since the dungeon scene on the Planet of the Gerontocrats in Consider Phelbas) and a sneaking regard for the ""bad guys"", the gasbag Affront."
4,"highly complex, very enjoyable sf, beautiful language","I happened upon Excession by chance, and enjoyed it so much that I immediately picked up all of Bank`s SF books. He uses wonderful language,precise, clear, witty, just as a language lover's experience, it's worth reading. At the same time, it is a very gripping story. His use of parallel strands of storytelling and his very interesting use of time - he actually tells the story in the reverse, up to a point - would be confusing if not done so masterfully. Consider Phlebas, which is very well reviewed by some others here, was very dark and somber, while this novel is so beautifully amorally joyous for most of the characters, one of the most impressive reads in a long time. I look forward to reading the rest of his books."
3,"Good beginning, no climax, no end.","Banks' ""Culture Universe"" is definitely intriguing, the backdrop for potentially great stories such as ""Player of Games"". This book looks promising from the start, but then you realise that you're halfway through the book, and nothing much has happened. By the end, still nothing has happened. Missed opportunity for a good story."
3,Good Setup... but that's all their is.,"When I read a book, I want a page turner. I want the story to have enough interesting for me to want to see what happens on the next page. While Ian Banks does create an imaginative universe where different species coexist and interact, there is not enough characterization for me to care about what happens to any character, neither major or minor.The major characters themselves do not progress much. We are told they change from a time before the book starts but the reader is not witness to that change. The story sets up potentially major characters, but they do not contribute in any ways significant to the story line other than a different perspective for the reader to know.The set up to the major conflict in the story arc takes too long. And when the major conflict comes to a point, by then you don't really care what happens to any of them.While this is my first Ian Bank book, I am an avid science fiction reader and I believe this book was ok."
2,Interesting but tedious.,This book had many interesting concepts but there was too much not relevant to the story and it is somewhat confusing trying to keep all the players in their proper place. It would have been a much better book if it were a few hundred pages shorter.
2,Great ingredients but grossly undercooked,"As I waded through Banks' story I wondered why I didn't like it more. I never got engaged or really found a character about whom I cared deeply. Compared to Vernor Vinge's A Fire Upon the Deep which I read straight through, Excession is a complete misfire. It has galactic travel, ship minds, suspended animation, time shifting, exotic xenobiology, and more but the story is related in episodic sections jumping around so much among points of view that a sense of plot or character is lost in the riffing on the certainly fascinating concepts Banks envisions. So this is more a book of ideas and concepts many of which are well realized than it is a novel or even a compelling story."
2,Great start but ended with a fart,"Don't know how to explain it but being fully ""interfaced"" between the MINDS running the various spaceships was GREAT in a cruising sense...but the unraveling of multiple plot lines and the eventual blackholing of characters in face of the some alien Quitoxic reflective ""being"" as EXCESSION...hmmm, a bit too excessive"
1,CAUTION: DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE,"This movie was sooo bad, I stopped watching it after the first 30 mins. I mean some of the ladies are beautiful, but this is the worst low budget film I ever seen. Its more like low budget porn than anything. It could have been a better film if the story line was produced better and focused less on the man having sex w/ his woman. The way the film is structured, you would have thought that the man was bisexual himself. Just do yourself a favor and DON'T Buy This FILM!!!"
3,"BI Chance, slight chance...","Bi Chance is a decent movie, but with better editing the film could have been taken more seriously. The acting is okay, but with the subject matter I expected more. The comedy in the film drowns the real drama."
2,Turn piece not practical,The only thing I do not like about this product is the turning mechanism on top of the product. It is very flimsly and very hard to turn. I had already broken one set but thought it was a fluke so I purchased another one for me and one for my elderly mother. I still found it very hard to turn and she found it impossible and broke it right away. I wish this problem was corrected as the rest of it is very good. The turning wheels work well in the inside and I like the spray and clothes that are included. I can carefully get it to work even though the turning mechanism on top is hard to turn.
2,Very uncomfortable,"I hoped that since this was an expensive shoe, it would be more comfortable than it was."
4,Great functions but uncomforatable strap,"I am a fan of the Timex Ironman series because they have the ""countdown repeat"" function, which is perfect for doing laps in pools - it chimes off every minute (or whatever you program) to keep you on a consistent pace. But I recommend getting one with a cloth strap rather than the rigid-ish plastic one here; I've had both and find the former much more comfortable."
5,Ironman watch,"This is a great watch, I don't have to wear my glasses when I am swiming so I can see what time it is. It is comfortable, good looking and works great."
3,It's an okay watch...nothing special,"Not exactly what I was looking for, but hey it tells the time....I gave it to my son."
2,The Wanamaker Legacy,Most of the recital was too soft on this magnificent instrument. A grand organ should have a grand sound...from start to finish.
1,Wrong shipped CD,"By an unfortunate mistake in shipping, the CD in the ""Wanamaker Legay"" jewel case was not the Wanamaker organ. It was Virgil Fox playing an unidentified organ. I was given an immediate refund."
1,poor recording,I've just received a series of recordings on the organ and found all but one of them quite good recordings. This is the bad one!
3,Title Incomplete,"My only complaint with this book is that nowhere in the title or description of this book does it state that it is a manual for Photo Elements 2002. In looking back over the description on the Amazon page there is no mention of the book being for PE 2002. I have Adobe Elements 7.0 and this book is absolutely useless.So be sure you are choosing a book for the version software you have, because although is looks fairly thorough if you're using 2002 the interface has changed and is not helpful for other versions."
2,"Nice try, but too light","I'd agree with Charleston; better books exist on the subject. (""Gili's Book"", for one)"
5,Good value,Happy with the product. It was as advertised. Great service; fast delivery and easy to do business with.
3,Things you need to know to have Ray's TECHNICAL ABILITY,"If you want to have Ray's TECHNICAL ABILITY (not his musical concepts), this book surely have the content of what you need to know to be one. But if you're a beginner (which at this time needs full guidance in almost everything), then maybe this book isn't yet for you (except, if someone more experienced could help you out). Almost from the beginning we were forced to find out fingerings on your own (and this is good, if you already have enough experience with the instrument). So, if you don't have enough experience, you need another book that gives you full guidance in every material taught, for example: Lew Berryman's 'Intonation Plus'.Another problem - there's some mistakes in the books. Either some wrongly written notes, and some wrongly written content. P 29 have exactly the same content with p 31, but the titles were different. These things could led to confusion."
5,Ray Brown's Bass Method,"This book will complete any aspiring bass student's learning methodology along with their classical training, utilizing book's like F. Simandl's classic technique series. Along with the teaching of a quality instructor, the learning musician will find working between classic and jazz forms an expansion of expression Ray Brown discovered in developing his interpretation of upright bass technique."
3,Madeline's Winter Vacation,"The movie is really cute, except there is an abdomindable snowman that my two-year old daughter is afraid of. She covers her eyes when she sees him. Otherwise she loves the show."
1,NEVER RECIVED PRODUCT!!!,"i never received the 30"" chain i purchased i contacted the seller and they never responded until i filed a bad report then they gave me some number to track down the product. I will never buy from then ever! i should have gone on EBAY i never get screwed there!!!!"
4,Comprehensive Guide!,"Texas has had a great and colorful history! This book tells about this history from an archeologist's point of view. From PaleoIndian to the simply historic, great digs and their importance are described in the state of Texas."
1,Maybe good for kids,"I thought this would be a slightly more academic book. It has some fairly decent information, but it is written like an elementary school textbook. Also, there are these really terrible ""What would it be like"" sections were they tell little fake stories about the people featured in the book. Terrible. Skip it."
5,read it in one day,"This is a great book for the novice and directs the reader in the field of historical and present archaeology, Texas field research, and in my opinion...Texas history- from ancient to present times. I thought the drawings, even though primitive, were helpful and interesting and did not degrade the subject matter at all. I've driven by many of the spots mentioned in the book all my life and never knew what awesome things lie beyond the barbed wire fences. This is a book that I will take with me on long road trips traveling across the highways in the great state of Texas that I call home!"
2,Poorly done,"Disappointed in this book. Poorly done drawings of points and of other things. Subject matter jumps around too much, reads like a ""People Magazine"" version of archaeology."
4,great coffee,"overall i absolutely love the coffee, but the machine is somewhat high maintenance. The thermostat burnt out a month after i bought it, and it took Saeco 6 weeks to repair it. It worked well for almost two years after that, and it looks like the thermostat died on me again. I'm sending it to local authorized repair place but i have no idea how much it'll cost.Overall- maintenance is time-consuming and expensive but the coffee is wonderful.However, a $750 coffeemaker should not break at least once a year.update 2 years later: the second repair was almost $200- the thermostat burnt out. This time it was out of pocket since it was nounder warranty. It worked for 4 months after that- and lo and behold, the thermotat went again. I ended up trashing the machine and getting a new one. What can i say, i love the coffee :)I've had the new one for a year, and the LED display is starting to burn out. If this one dies i'm going to try Jura Capresso."
5,Caricature 101,"With Keelan Parham's ""Let's Toon Caricatures"" school is in session. This book is a must have for both up and coming and seasoned caricature artists alike. I have been doing caricatures for over ten years now, and seen all of the how to caricature books, and this one takes the cake. This is not so much a how to book, but a manual with practical real world applicable instructions. He not only teaches you how to ""toon"" faces, how to set up the best way, but how to deal with some of the little problem's that arise in everyday caricaturing. He gives you all you need to get started doing successful caricaturing. I definitely have seen improvement in my work, and plan to reread it again and again so I remember everything that Keelan taught me. Buy it, you will NOT regret it!"
5,The Complete Caricature Course!,"For a complete novice who suddenly realised it would be fun to have a go at drawing caricatures, I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Other ""how to"" books on the subject left me feeling inadeqate and incapable of drawing anything resembling my victims. When Keelans book safely and quickly arrived to me here in the UK, the easy step by step illustrations immediatley gave me the confidence and skill I was lacking and my results have rapidly improved.I now find myself staring a strangers trying to decide how I would tackle their caricature by wondering what their head shape is and how their features are arranged. Thanks Keelan!"
5,A must have reference,"Keelan Parham shows beginners and experienced artists an excellent approach to the art of drawing caricatures. You'll find this book to be a comprehensive, entertaining, exciting and easy to follow tutorial filled with start-to-finish examples. Keelan explains the value of line quality, simplicity, accessorizing and much, much more. This book is written for anyone who draws or is interested in drawing caricatures, and best of all: it's FUN. I highly recommend it!"
4,Some Drawing Experience might be needed,"I am not an artist but am very interested in drawaing simple caricatures of people.I received Keelan`s book and was very impressed with the way the book lays out the foundation for a person to do caricatures.However after reading the book I came to my own personal opinion that in order to do some of the things the book gives you that you need some drawing experience or natural drawing talent, I have neither.However that being said I would still highly recommend this book to anyone willing to put in some long hours of patience and practice.That I can do."
5,Extremely Helpful,"Although I've been cartooning professionally for years, I've only recently started doing caricatures. This book was a great help in getting me going. The author breaks down the caricature process in an easy-to-follow and entertaining manner.I'd recommend this book to beginners as well as to more advanced artists who are interested in learning to draw caricatures."
2,Anthony was definately running out of steam,"Piers Anthony was obviously having trouble figuring out what to do with Nature. Add to the fact that he just doesnt write female lead characters very well and you have a very mediocre book. How many times can Orb dance the Tanana in a wet nighty? Sigh. Still, it's worth a read if only to finish out the series."
3,"Well-intended, but a weak link in the INCARNATIONS series.","I have to admit, I expected a whole lot more from Gaea. The book may be a wonderful book, but compared to the others of the Incarnations series, she was weak. I loved Nature's interactions in the other books and I did love the ending of this book, but the plot proved to be slightly boring. I like the other INCARNATIONS books better."
3,At least I've now read all in this series --,"I see there are great differences in opinions on this book -- I enjoyed the other four in this series but had to struggle through this one. I assume, since this was the fifth of the series, it was the fifth written. As I read the book, I had the feeling that Mr. Anthony had gotten to the ""Let's get this overwith!"" point with this one. Not near as much to think about, or to be intrigued by as there was in On A Pale Horse or Bearing an Hourglass."
1,Disgusting!,"This book is the worst Piers Anthony has ever written. The plot is shallow and disjointed, three of the lead characters have no names, the female lead is written with startling ineptitude, and the storyline is absolutely nothing new compared to the other books in the Incarnations of Immortality series. There are only two possible reasons to read this book. 1: You are trying to finish off the series. 2: You are an aspiring writer who wants the confirmation of reading something by a published author that could have been done by a twelve year old with a typewriter and a sick mind."
3,Lossy and glossy.,"Being a huge fan overall of the entire Incarnations series, that means that <u>Being a Green Mother</u> is lumped in there as well. While I do thoroughly appreciate and enjoy the idea that Piers Anthony has put forth with this series, this book just does not do that idea justice, as far as I'm concerned.It's as though the author was rushed to get to 'the interesting parts', and glossed over some areas that I really would have liked to seen more depth to. I felt like I was being told, ""Yadda yadda yadda, I had the lobster.""This book could have been so much more, and while I do enjoy repeat readings of it, each time I go back to it I'm struck more and more with how much -isn't- there, rather than what is."
4,"Great series, decent book.","The book is part of a great series, but this particular installment is luke warm by comparison. There's plenty of exposition, as well as loose ends in the story line being tied up, but it doesn't seem as fun to read as the rest of the series.After reading the book I found out why. If you read the authors notes you find out that Piers Anthony was tired of writing the series, and while he knew he had to write a final book to give the series an ending, he didn't want people constantly bugging him to start writing the series again (like what happened with his Xanth series.) Therefore he purposely made this book a less enjoyable read.Later inspiration struck and he continued the series with For Love of Evil."
1,I couldn't even finish...,"After reading the first four books in this series, I picked up this one, thinking that I would enjoy it just as much. Oh, how I hate it when I'm wrong...There was just nothing there to hold my interest. It was.... well, boring! I didn't care one bit about the characters or what happened to any of them.Maybe it got better toward the end, but I can't say for sure. I think I was about 100 - 130 pages into it and just trying to force myself through. So - I decided to stop.Sorry Piers."
1,the series just gets worse,"This is the only review I will write for the entire Incarnations of Immortality series because the review will be about the same for each book.The series is uneven most of the time, with philosophy thrown in with annoyingly cute humor and cliches. This book is the worst of the lot. It goes on and on about this quest, following the exact same formula as in all the other books. The only thing that changes is the point of view depending on what character is highlighted.It's boring. It's a waste of time. The only good thing about this book (and all the rest) are the interesting concepts about Death, Time, Fate, War, Nature, Evil, and Good. The premise is okay, but the storytelling is awful. Read one book and consider yourself done."
1,RECALLED DUE TO INFANT DEATHS!,Please note that this carrier is UNSAFE and has been recalled by Infantino. They no longer make or sell this product because several infants died in it. These types of baby carriers - bag style with a deep pouch are very unsafe. Please do not purchase this product. There are much better user-friendly and safe baby carriers out there.
2,Not good for nursing,"I bought this carrier strictly for the purpose of nursing on the go. As the box itself advertises. However, even with a 9 lb baby I could not get her positioned inside to nurse and be in the sling at the same time. It is too deep for nursing and the sling is too hot for my baby to ride in in 60 degree weather. I returned this sling after two weeks of use."
2,Could be better,"I bought this before my son was born. He hated it. He screamed each time i put him in it. This sling seemed to swallow him up. His head seemed too far up yet there was alot of room towards his feet. I think if they redesigned this sling with the straps down just a few more inches, it would be great. Hear that Infantino???? REDESIGN THE SLING!!!!!!The pros: Really easy to use.It was easy to carry.I ended up giving this away to a friend ang bought myself a ring sling which I found worked better for me and baby."
1,Disappointment,"I was hoping to be able to put my daughter in it and have two hands free to get something done. She had colic and wanted to be held all the time, basically in that position. It just seemed like she was too big for it. Her head just gets lost in it and she hates it. She is only 9 weeks old now and I thought I would get some use out of it for a few months. But she just won't tolerate it! It was almost as if she was going to sufficate in it the way her head was in it. It has a piece of material in it that you velcro and strap them in so that they don't fall out or move. It seems like that piece needed to move down in order to give her head some room. It just didn't work for us and I don't see how it would work for anyone else, unless they only want to use it for the first 4 weeks or so while the baby is still very small."
2,Why is my baby being squished in here?,"We tried to put our 22"" 9.5lb baby in this sling. We strapped her bottom into the little holder and my wife slung it over her shoulder. Unfortunately, this sling seems to crunch our baby in on herself so her nose is practically touching her chest. It can't be a good position for keeping a nice open airway. I don't get how anyone can use this thing without their baby being folded in half."
4,My daughter loves it!,"Overall this sling is working out well. My daughter is 8 weeks old, but was born premature and is still just under 6 pounds. We've been using it for a week and she loves it. She sleeps very soundly and I love carrying her in it. It is great for keeping her shielded from people when out in stores etc. The negatives are: her head turns to one side and she does feel warm on warmer days. But, she still sleeps well in the sling and doesn't seem to mind the warmth or head turning to one side! So, it must make her feel very secure and I think that's a big plus. I haven't used it for breastfeeding as it does seem to hang too low (I'm 5'8""), but as a sling to carry her around it I'd say so far so good. Also, no problems with soreness in my shoulders, but my baby is small so we;ll see if that changes in a couple months!"
2,For Newborns in Cold Weather Only!,"Having received both a Snugli and a Sling, I wasn't sure which one to keep so I tried them both out. Unfornunately this didn't live up to my expectations. Its uncomfortable after about 8 pounds and is awkward for my baby. Her head falls to one side & she sweats profusely in it in just a diaper. The strap doesn't give you any support, constantly slipping down and its impossible to do anything like work around the house or take a long distance walk. The snugli was much better for that, although its harder to get the baby in and out, especially while sleeping. She did fall asleep immediately in it but woke up when she got too hot about an hour later."
4,Better then most,"I had a different sling with my first child and this one is much better. That being said, my second daughter just hates being in a sling period. So even though this is a nice sling some babies just don't like them. This one in comparison to the the Dr. Sears one I bought, is easier to use and is better looking. Hope this helps!"
1,Save your money! I wish I had saved mine!,"Lousy! My daughter, who is considered average for her height and weight,r never fit in it properly. It felt uncomfortable to wear. What a WASTE!!!!"
2,There are better!,"I was a carrier novice then I purchased this before my baby was born. This was the first sling I used, and I first put my son in it at 10 days old. I did like the ""swaddle"" feature, I felt like at least he wouldn't fall out of it. But, the sling wasn't at all comfy for a post-partum mom. It also wasn't that well-designed, and I agree about having the wrong ratio of room at the top of the head. I felt like he was at an awkward angle, and nursing in this thing sucked big time. I eventually gave up on this thing LONG before the weight limit. It was too shallow to do a tummy-to-tummy or a ""buddha"" carry, and the shoulder is completely uncomfortable.I graduated to a Moby Wrap at about 3 months old, and to ring slings at around 4 months old, and then at around 8 months old, to Hotsling pouch slings.I can't imagine a 20 pound baby in this thing!"
2,Too big for small babies and small moms,"I bought this sling and the ultimate baby wrap to see which one my baby and I liked better. The answer is neither. I am 5'6"" and around 130 lbs, my daughter is 21"" and about 7.5 lbs. It is easy to wear, but she sank so far within the sling she couldn't see out and this made for a very unhappy baby. Also, I had to adjust the buckle all the way to one side so that I wasn't kicking my baby as I walked, which left a long strap hanging down my back. I liked the design and pattern, but it just wasn't working for either of us, so I had to return it."
3,Could have been better,"I had high hopes for this novel but they were not realized. The main problem that I had with this novel is that the flow of the story was not very smooth. The ""chapter"" transitions were pretty choppy and there were quiet a few typos. It also ends quite abrubtly. It literally ends mid scene. Perhaps this was done on purpose to lead up to a sequal but if this is true I am not too sure that I will be reading it."
2,A Lesser Life is Thought Provoking but the economic policy will not work,"I read this book over twenty years ago but I still remember its arguments that Western European governments, whether ""socialistic"" or ""conservative"", made social investments in the raising of the children. It dawned upon me five years ago that the economic arguments for this policy were fallacious. The proof is in the pudding. The population of Western Europe is falling because people cannot afford housing. In America, the population is even expanding with or without immigration, because people can afford to buy homes."
1,Really...??,"If I could give negative start ratings, this would be the one. Why it had a Five Star rating is beyond me. The production value is low, the acting is way sub-par. It feels like your watching an adult film. A really bad one at that. Skip it!"
2,It's all government programs,"This is a huge book and took a while to read. It's all government programs to pay your rent, bills, tuition, etc. I'd split the cost with a few friends and take turns reading it. Even used, this isn't a big bargain. There was a total of THREE programs that would be useful to me. Not that great."
2,Not as expected,"This book offered more disability programs and veteran programs available to those people, not just anyone. I expected to find out about things offered to people who did not fit this type of profile, but who might be able to acquire government grants or money through programs not known to the general public. Everyone knows about the programs offered in this book, or can easily find out about them through their local government offices. I was glad I did not pay the full $30 + price at a book store for this book. I would really have been upset. The only thing that might be useful to me specifically is college money for my daughter, who has already graduated with a Bach. of Science degree, but who may have to go back and take some additional classes in order to get her teacher's certification. I would not recommend this book to people I know as a great source of help."
2,Misleading,"In the infomercials it states ""millionaires are eligible"" and the title is ""Free money to pay your bills"" It is obvious that the author wants you to think of this book as a way to get rich quick. Thank God I at least checked mine out from the library. Seriously folks if the government was just giving away money we'd all be millionaires. That being said it still doesn't justify the authors tailoring this reference in such a misleading way. Using human greed to feed one's own greed...how ironic."
5,EXCELLENT CONDITION - SUPER FAST!,"The book arrived nearly two weeks before the guaranteed date. The book condition listing was ""Good"", but it was Excellent. I had been expecting to find a previous user's notes scrawled in the margins, but it looked like I was the first one to actually open the book!The price of the book was less than half of its $100+ new price. I found that the average used price for this book was just a little less than the new price.I will put this seller at the top of my list when looking for used books.Thanks!"
3,best in years,"Phil Collins has never been a good singer, his wavering nasil voice was an annoying step down from Peter Gabriels (even though he was a good drummer) so Genesis did a good job by finding a replacement vocalist for Collins who sounded like Gabriel in Ian Wilson. On top of that Tony and Mike used two excellent drummers as additional musitions on this album. This works quite well for the 3 standout tracks on this album Alien Afternoon, The Dividing Line and One Mans Fool. Even though the rest of this albums filler the combo of Wilsons strong rasp and the drumming make this Genesises best album in years."
1,And then there were none...,"There were several fatal errors that Genesis took that cause their near-demise: First, they waited too long between albums (excluding 'The Way We Walk', there was a 6 year gap between 'We Can't Dance' and 'Calling All Stations', so some fans were bound to give up or forget the band. Second. Phil Collins quit the band, there goes the killer drumming and vocals. Third, Tony & Mike hire some no-name singer named Ray Wilson (only Fred Durst is a more lousier singer). The music isn't that bad, but even Tony's voice would of been better than Ray's. Then there were times when I wonder, why didn't Tony hire a singer from his previous solo albums? I mean, Fish or Jayney Klimek would've been perfect for the music heard on this CD. It's just screaming out their names! Only Congo was the only decent song on this CD, but this album is not worth your time. First time Genesis listeners don't be deceived, because NONE of their other albums sound like this garbage!"
5,Classic,"This is the kind of record that only grows and grows the more you listen to it. Every time there is more to discover and in the end when you think you?ve heard it all, you can still return to it every second year for another 10 - 15 listenings. That?s what I call a classic! For the Genesis-lovers who failed to appreciate this I can only say, you?re like a begger an a beach of gold.It?s really saddening that this record was a commercial flop. It put an end to Genesis when they were at their best!But on the other hand, if you listen to Mike & the Mechanics, you will find a refined Genesis."
3,NOT A SPECIAL ONE!,"This album is entertaining but could be boring sometimes, and does not really reflect the GENESIS distinguished style!This is my own experience and opinion anyhow, and everybody's opinion is different!I would rate this album 3 1/2 Stars."
4,Fine recording from Tony & Mike,I think there are some beautiful songs on this cd..Fantastic keyboard playing by Tony( as usual)..beautiful chords...And Mike does a great job as well..The vocialist has a pleasant voice and the material is very nice.It's not the Genesis Material we are used to hearing..But I listen to it and it makes me feel good.It does not have a Peter or Phil fill to it...but I like it!
3,If you want REALLY DARK...listen Steve Hackett!,"Ok... not bad, as I've said before in an spanish writen review, this is not a bad album, but it's definetly inferior to the band's prior releases. Rutherford and Banks said in a 1997 interview that this album was dark... well, if you want REALLY DARK, listen to Steve Hackett's Darktown... that is great album!"
4,A nice combo of Gabriel progressive and Collins pop,"The fact this album hasn't sold the numbers as We Can't Dance or Invisible Touch is no surprise to me. Their label abandoned them because Phil isn't in the band anymore. That's too bad because this is the best Genesis album in a long time. I liked the pop stuff but it was the more expiremental pieces that caught my ear (Driving The Last Spike, etc).Ray Wilson does a fine job and fits in easily with darker sound. His voice gives an energy to the mix that hasn't been there the last few albums. Nir Z is good but he's no Phil Collins which is why it's only 4 stars.My personal faves are the title track, and Uncertain Weather."
2,I tried...I really did,"Lets start with the inevitable...this album is a piece of junk. It has been said in other reviews...but with Gabriel, Hackett and now even Collins gone...the chemistry just ISN'T there any more. Like taking 3-out-of-5 components out of a soup.I've given it a couple of years...maybe I'd grow used to the album. Maybe it was ahead of its time or something.None of that...""Calling All Stations' is Genesis without energy, creativity and sounding in each and every song as if they don't know where they are going to end. Pointless, directionless album.*deep sigh*The songs are just recorded a few BPMs too slow...the voice sounds so damned unsure of itself...pfff...So much obviously WRONG with this album...I wonder where all that experience Banks and Rutherford MUST have gained over all those years of working together with great musicians has gone.Exit...Genesis...may she rest in peace."
4,Genesis continues to evolve,"To the average listened, the most obvious aspect of Phil's departure is as the vocalist. But, the major blow of Phil's exit is not what he brought to the microphone, but what he brought to the drum kit. True, Phil was the one member of Genesis that most people can name (poor Mike and Tony.) But, it is not Ray Wilson who has caused Genesis to fall from airplay. This album has much good about it. One Man's Fool, Calling All Stations, The Dividing Line, and Congo are all wonderful songs...just not sung by Phil."
4,Give Mike and Tony a Chance,"Well, they're not art-rock anymor. Not even that pop hurricane. But this album is very good. How many bands on the road today can wrtie such powerfull songs as title-track and There Must Be Some Other Way? Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks wrote most of the hits in Genesis history. Phil Collins said that. Let's wait for the next album. And let's see if some of the new stars that music media invents every year will be writting nice songs and selling 2 million copies in the next 30 days. Mauricio Noriega"
4,"Surprizingly wonderful, but may not be what you want","I have been writing a much much longer review for months, then decided to scrap it and just sum it up for you.Pros: This is the best Genesis studio album since the 4th side of Three Sides Live. Excellent drumming, wow. Ray Wilson is excellent in the band.Cons: The songs are awfully similar sounding, and many lack real endnings. If you want a preview of what a Banks-Rutherford dominated genesis sounds like, listen to the last (istrumental) half of the song Abacab and you'll have a flavor of where CAS comes from.Bottom line: They could use a songwriter in this band with some fresh ideas. Is Ray like Peter or Phil? No."
2,Why bother?,"I've never thought Phil Collins was the most important member of Genesis, but that doesn't mean this post-Phil effort is worth much. Anyone who listens to it objectively has to be disappointed. There is a smattering of pretty good songs, but overall this is not worth your time. No true Genesis fan could possibly give this five stars."
1,Find a new bloke,"How in the world Tony and Mike could choose Ray Wilson for vocals is beyond my wildest imagination. He simply cannot sing. Shipwrecked should have been the name of this CD. I have been following Genesis since Foxtrot and was amazed that Phil could take over for Peter. Each is different, each is alike, and each sound very good. I plead with these guys to get someone who can bring it back again or this could be it. As you listen to this CD it just keeps getting worse and I have tried to like it. The first 3 songs are fair and after that nothing. What a shame."
2,"Great sound,poor content","Shortly: this album has awsome sounds, awsome guitars, awsome voice.But that's all. The content of songs is empty. What's worse, I think, this is a love-songs album. Each third word is ""you"". The songs are basically about how the singer is willing to be a little puppy, just to get her back. The content of songs is very intime--i hardly can imagine,that anybody will listen to this on a daily basis. I can't imagine, how could these songs be delivered on a big concert.They are simply very deppressive,sad...and just empty,the singer sings them,like he has no soul!"
2,A Shame,"This CD isn't horrible. But it doesn't sound like Genesis. It's a far, far cry from We Can't Dance. They wisely haven't released a follow up to this. I think the group's days are numbered. Unless...Phil, will you rejoin Genesis?"
4,So it's not Phil Collins. Who cares?,"The atmosphere is terrific. As for Ray Wilson, he has a terrific voice that at times reminds me of Peter Gabriel's finest moments with the band (if you were lucky enough to see Genesis live while Ray was in the band, you know what I mean). The standout tracks in this one are definitely: ""Congo,"" ""Not About Us"", and ""If That's What You Need."" I recommend this album to all Genesis fans, both old-school and current, as well as to anyone looking for a VERY welcome change of pace in pop music. Here's hoping Tony and Mike decide to give it another go. This album is not perfect, but its flirting with the band's progressive edge gives us glimpses of what could be a very bright future for one of the greatest bands of all time."
3,At least that Collins is gone,"This album can't be worse than the previous ones for the simple reason that Phil Collins, the world's most boring singer, left the band. Congratulations !"
4,This is a pretty good album,"No this album doesn't have Phil Collins, but don't dismiss it because of that. Ray Wilson does a decent job with the vocals and the music is written by Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford. While it's not their best work, it's not bad by any stretch. There are some real highlights here, two of which I can mention off the top of my head; Congo and If That's What You Need. In summary, be open minded if you're a Genesis fan and give this album a real try. I don't think you'll be sorry."
1,HORRIBLE!,"Older sounding GENESIS? Hardly! Sounds more like the throw away songs from Mike and the Mechanics albums gone by. Mike and Tony, shame on you. What were you two thinking? This longtime GENESIS fan was saddened when this release came out, but was almost drawn to tears when he actually heard this pathetic musical effort."
4,Cannot be compared to Wind & Wuthering...,"Though I did enjoy many of the songs on this album, it's just not right to compare this cd to Phil Collins' Wind & Wuthering. Twenty-three years have passed since the time they made Wind & Wuthering, but without Phil, nothing can beat Genesis' earlier days with Collins. I enjoyed It's not about Us & many other songs on the Calling All Stations album, but Ray's voice is much more limited than Phil's. Can you imagine Ray singing ""You Have your Own Special Way?"" I like the new Genesis, but without Phil... It's just not the same band anymore."
4,The end of Collins' era...,"Actually, I enjoyed when listening this album after pop-rhythms in the last Genesis' albums with Phil. Of course, it is not as strong as ""Selling England..."" or ""Lamb..."", but definitely better than the albums inspired by Collins. The title theme and ""Congo"" are my favourite in this album. So, if you do not like Phil, but like Genesis, you should have this album in your collection."
3,¡Por fin se ha ido Phil Collins!,"Puede que haya otorgado demasiadas estrellas al disco, pero creo que la marcha de Phil Collins bien merece una celebración. Collins fue un buen batería, pero sus baladas cursis y su inmerecido protagonismo habían convertido a Genesis casi en lo opuesto de lo que fue cuando era uno de los mejores grupos del mundo. El melodrama ha regresado; han vuelto el dramatismo y la melancolía. Bienvenidos sean. A ver si en el próximo disco cuidan más los textos, se esfuerzan más instrumentalmente (sin divismos, eso sí) y abandonan cualquier referencia a las horribles e insustanciales baladas de Collins. Ah. Ray Wilson canta muy bien, y escénicamwnte han mejorado."
4,This is a very good album!,"When I first listened to ""Calling All Stations"", I admit that I didn't like the album at first, since it just didn't sound the same without Phil's vocals. After listening to it a few more times, it started to grow on me. Ray Wilson is an excellent singer, and the music is very good. Even though ""There Must Be Some Other Way"" is in reference to a negative topic (divorce), the music is quite moving, and Ray's voice is strong. This is my favorite track on the album. I have been a long-time fan of Genesis, and ""Calling All Stations"" is one of the best albums the group has put out. I'm looking forward to the next one."
4,A New Genesis Is Born!,"OK. That's it. No more Gabriel, no more Collins. Now it's just the real Genesis songwriting core: Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford. No more happy-light-radio-friendly non-sense. An album as important as Foxtrot. Ray Wilson stands as Genesis ultimate vocalist, and maybe one of rock's finest: he just seem to get any note, without effort! Finally, a comeback to melodies. It's not a five-star just because of two songs: 'If That's What You Need', and 'Small Talk', which are completely superficial. Buy it and listen it carefully, maybe it's not big deal at first hearing, but the same happens with the old stuff. Genesis is back, we just need Hackett again: Rutherford, shut up 'n play bass!"
1,A great time for a tax write-off,"Best thing to do with this is give it to charity and take the donation off your 1040. However, proceed with caution as even the IRS would know this thing has no value. Mike and Peter should have known much better than to ever let this get into print. Real Genesis fans run as fast as you can from this imposter. And Ray - please learn another trade"
3,Un poco aburrido... mejor esperar el proximo.,"Si señores, hace falta el Sr. Collins en las voces y mas que nada, en la bateria. Sin embargo no se puede decir que el disco es absolutamente malo... tiene momentos interesantes, como ""Calling All Stations""; ""Congo""; ""Shipwrecked"" y ""Small Talk"", de ahi, el resto es insultantemente aburrido. Extraño de un super grupo como lo es Genesis. Espero que el proximo sea mil veces mejor que este, de lo contrario, estaremos asistiendo al comienzo del funeral de un gran dinosaurio del rock."
3,"Solid, but still miss Phil","Without Phil Collins' upbeat songwriting and singing, this album takes on a darker and moody quality that I actually like. Tony Banks' keyboard work is brilliant as usual. Too many of the songs fade out however (c'mon write a decent ending for once !). Singer Ray Wilson kind of grows on you, but I can still picture Phil singing some of these melodies - which makes me wish he stuck around for this one."
4,A whole lot better than '...Dance',"I really didn't know what to expect when I put this cd in the player. I hoped it would sound more like a Tony Banks solo album than a remake of We Can't Dance. I was pleased to find that it did. It's a lot easier to pick out who wrote what. I like it. I especially like Dividing Line and Alien Afternoon. If you don't like this album better than ...Dance, check out how I reviewed that album."
4,It sounds better everyday,"Being a brazilian Genesis fan from the age of 9 - i'm 31 now - its great to know, first of all, that Genesis is still alive. CAS is an album to be listened years and yars. Neither classic not revolutionaire, but just a good album, with three or four great pop songs like title song, Not About Us, There Must Be Some Other Way. Genesis still has some fuel to burn. To whom doubt it, try to listen to the third single from CAS, Not About Us. Sign Your Life Away and Run Out of Time are songs that proves that Tony and Mike deserve respect in pop music world."
3,"Not the debut that Phil experienced, but good nonetheless","Peter left and Phil experienced Trick of the Tail's amazing aclaim. This album is not what Genesis was during Collin's time; however, was From Genesis to Relevation a Gabriel landmark? Keep in mind this group is awesome without Hackett, Phillips, Gabriel and now without Collins, so they are experiencing some growing pains on their third phoenix rising. It is a good album, better than Genesis and Invisible Hand during Collin's rein. Salutaions - A Genesis Fan"
3,"OK, but nowhere close to their best","Ray sounds too much like Paul Carrack, making this album sound like a Mike and the Mechanics release. The instrumentation and Tony's keys in particular are very good and occassionally great (last half of Alien Afternoon is late 70s Genesis come back to life), but the overall dark feel of the album is too much of a downer. I was sad that they didn't tour the US this time, because the live show appears to have been an awesome visual spectacle as usual and might have given me a whole new perspective on the new material. Overall, after waiting 6 years for a new album, this was a disappointment. I still won't give up on them, though....Tony and Mike are still one of the best songwriting teams out there, so I look forward to the next album and to CAS just being a temporary misstep in a long and illustrious career."
1,Absolutely Awful,"This was suppose to be Genesis's delve back into serious music from the 70's. You'd never know it from this album. They should have at least tried to get someone who was in the Gabriel / Collins vocal range. And the music is downright vile. It's hard to believe the this came from the same musical minds that brought us ""Mad Man Moon"", ""Your own special Way"", and other masterpieces. I couldn't wait till this disc was done to get it out of the player, and into the garbage!"
1,"Time to move on folks, this horse is dead.","I am a huge fan of Genesis. The first LP's with Gabriel will always be in my collection. When Phil Collins stepped up to lead vocals it quickly grew on me and I was impressed. But then I feel in the 80's he took the band into a nose dive that they may never recover from. I know Phil doesn't like hearing about being the culprit but when you listen to solo projects, the proof is there.I was highly disappointed when this LP came out. I bought it immediately in hopes that a new singer would bring life back into this band, but it didn't happen. Each song is bland, effortless and cut short as if it were for demo purpose. As if it were meant to be samples. This LP will collect a lot of dust if you buy it. Sorry Tony and Mike but let it go."
2,Somebody Please Bring Back Prog Rock,"Having been a fan of this band for 20 years, and thinking that Peter Gabriel's exit actually improved the band, and allowed him to do great music as well, I really have tried to like this album. It sounds to me like its either some stuff that they left on the cutting floor from ""We Cant Dance"" or maybe some Mike and Mechanic's retreads. I'm certainly not in love with Phil Collins, in fact when I heard he was leaving and they would be getting a new vocalist, I looked forward to hearing the new sound. I don't have a problem at all with Ray Wilson, I think he sounds somewhat like Paul Carrack, its just the material did not do it for me. I do hope however that the band will continue. I'm willing to give their next CD a chance. Even had I liked the new album, I wouldn't have heard it anyway for this market refuses to give new releases by the prog rock bands any airplay To most people in this town, Lynard Skynard is progressive enough, one would think!"
3,More fine POP from the band that used to be So Much More,"Once there was a band that dared to create music like no one had ever done before, music rich with Hammond organs, 12-string guitars and an orchestral approach. Music that told stories and uplifted your heart and inspired you! Melodies that soared!But this band discovered that if they stopped being so darned creative and original, and made music similar to other successful bands, that they could appeal to a larger audience (the dreaded Lowest Common Denominator). So they smothered their passions, squashed their genius, and Got Rich!This is really a pretty decent album if you like pop, but it's indistinguishable from thousands of other nice pop records. NO GENIUS HERE, FOLKS. My heart yearns for another album like Trick Of The Tail or Trespass or The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway."
2,"Ah well, maybe they can go back to their solo careers now...","I've been a fan of Genesis as long as I remember...I grew up listening to my brother playing their albums over and over and over...and I would have to say this is my least favorite of any album they have ever done. It's not just the loss of Phil...I've enjoyed both Tony and Mike's solo efforts, so that is not the problem. It's just too overdone...almost a desperate attempt to show they can do *serious* music without him, and it just doesn't work. There are some good moments and some good music, but they are just too few and far between."
3,Kathy Smith PIlates for Lower Body,"I would not suggest this workout for the average pilate user. This is an intermmediate to advanced workout. Usually I love Kathy's instruction, but this workout contain so many steps to achieve one movement that it became frustrating to follow the routine. Some of the terms she used were completely foreign to me. If you are considering buying this workout make certain you know your pilates."
3,a little too slow for my taste.....,"i purchased this DVD because it is difficult to find tapes that focus just on the lower body, and i love pilates. i imagine this DVD would be fine for beginners, but i found it to be all instruction. after the tape was finished, i felt as if i learned a lot, but it was not a very good workout. she seemed like a good instructor though. very slow. so sorry."
5,Maximiliano,"Excellent team, came in perfect new condition and flawless. LIittmann design make this stethoscope is versatile for the job it was designed."
2,"No, don't use this. Really.","I like Eyewitness Guides a lot, particularly for their glossy graphics combined with comprehensive information, but this really doesn't make the cut. How is it possible to cram Scotland into 224 pages? Well, it is not. Besides having very poor coverage on Glasgow and particularly Edinburgh, it also has - well, more poor coverage. Maps for the bigger islands in Northern Scotland are sorely lacking. More effort has really got to be invested in making this guide before it is worth your money. I know DK can make some really great guides, so it saddens me that they are now churning out trash like this."
2,Hard to read,"The book is visually pleasing and gave a good general overview but when we actually started looking for details to plan our trip, we found the format frustrating and vague. It wasn't organized the way we expected a travel guide to be and ended up getting the Lonely Planet book instead."
2,Slick and touristy,"This travel book is attractive and expensively produced. The content is probably quite satisfactory for travelers interested primarily in historic sites, castles, distilleries, restaurants, and posh places to sleep at night. However, I had hoped for travel tips that would help me explore the rugged Scottish coast, find places to see wildlife, and locate out-of-the-way places of interest to the adventurous, not just the affluent. I should have read the book's cover more carefully. It highlighted ""Sights in Edinburgh & Glasgow,"" ""Malt whiskies & where to enjoy them,"" "" Outstanding golf courses,"" ""Best hotels,"" ""Liveliest pubs and clubs,"" ""Best restaurants,"" and the like."
2,Not a good guide,"We used in August . Found it to be of little value. One small example: By chance we visited the Kelvingrove Museum in Glasgow. Truly a ""must visit"" museum. The guide book (revised version dated 2006) says it is closed for renovation. We were told that it had been reopened in 2005.David J. California"
3,"Good book, but not great","The book had a good overview of everything to see and do, but I prefer the format of Lonely Planet or other books that go more indepth"
5,Scotland in a Nutshell,This little book has been very helpful in familiarizing us with Scotland in preparatation for a trip there this summer. The information is very succinct but adequate to whet your appetite. After reading the book I am looking forward to seeing all of the sites in person.
2,Very poorly edited,"After noticing that five people were sitting in four chairs in the high school office, I started looking for similar inconsistentcies. Are there editors or at least proofreaders at publishing companies these days? All the characters seemed to speak in the same voice and the old guy who's his friend seems way too much like the crazy old guy who lives in the swamp in Carl Hiasen's books. Get Toby Peters back to work."
4,A fun read,"I have been a Toby ""Peelers"" fan for ages and was delighted to find out Stuart Kaminsky has begun a new series. Yea, Stuart!Right from page one, I was suckered into Lew Fonesca's world. I hope it doesn't take too long for the second book to appear, but I will wait patiently. I highly recommend this book."
3,"After Rosnikov, a disappointment","After having gone through almost every Rostnikov mystery with great joy, I was eagerly anticipating Kaminsky's new main protaganist, Lew Fonesca. But unfortunately I was disappointed. The characters just weren't that interesting to me, particularly Fonesca. I guess it's because I could identify more with Rostnikov - a sincere guy trying to do the best for himself, his family, and his fellow man. Fonesca, for whatever reason, seems aimless. Rostnikov was also grappling with ""the system"" whereas Fonesca had essentially dropped out. These observations are applicable to most of the characters in both stories.The plot, though interesting and entertaining, was dominated by the personalities. And the intricacies and resolution of the plot came too late to have a major effect on how I responded to the book."
2,First & Last Fonesca Novel,"Let's get to the heart of the matter: boring 'hero,' uninvolving characters, stilted dialogue, fragmented dual storylines, unappealing locale. 'Nuff said: I won't be back for more."
5,I enjoyed reading this book...,"This is my first book by Stuart M. Kaminsky, I enjoyed his work a lot, I highly recommend it."
1,Unnecessary part,"I bought these to go with the fans, and ended up not using them. The fans are flush enough normally, and this didn't save much room.Unless you have ascetic reasons, don't bother with these. I returned mine."
3,Small Minds,People try to fool a king. His daughter not only saves him but also his kingdom and daughter. This is a reversal where the child helps the parent to be a better person. To learn what is important. Not mentioned is she has proven her own worth and her time may come.
1,Really bad,"I thought this performance was bad. The dancers were not so good, and kind of boring. The exception is that it is the only full length Paquita around. However, most companies do Paquita as something quite different than this one, such as in the movie Kirov Classics."
5,beautiful book!,"I gave my 2-year-old nephew this book for his birthday (I think he'll enjoy it more next year). It's a beautiful celebration of the connectedness of all life. Like the American Indian blessing, ""All my relations."" Spirituality for kids, without religious overtones. Both his parents are psychologists, and they like it, too!"
5,All I See Is A Part of Me,"This is a charming and most beautifully illustrated story. I bought it as a gift for my youngest daughter, who just had her 1st child in Oct. She was thrilled and read the entire book before even opening the rest of her gifts."
4,Non-Dualism for Kids,"This is a fabulous introduction to non-dualism (providing that you scratch out several lines, starting with ""So you know everything, don't you see?"", where Ms. Curtis gets a little carried away). Though clearly written for kids, reading it as an adult reminds one that the most profound truths are simple in concept though difficult in realization. For those willing to see a common thread in all religions, it reminds one of Jesus' instruction to become like a child."
2,Okay but...,"This book was okay but might be a little too confusing for the average child (and maybe the average adult!). I appreciate the idea that there is a 'light' within us as people and in nature and in all living things but when the child sees the 'light' in a bar of chocolate and in a teddy bear??? I thought the idea was taken too far. Then I started getting confused about what she meant by the 'light' within us all because that light, as I imagine it, would NOT be found in inanimate objects.I normally love books like this and am very fond of the idea that we are all part of nature- all connected- but I really don't think this books does anything but jumble and confuse that idea.The drawings are average- not particularly breath-taking.All in all I don't think I'd read this book again or recommend it but I applaud the author for trying."
2,The artwork is lovely but.......,"I am just sorry. This SEEMS like the kind of book I would really like. I bought it for my granddaughter when she was tiny. Now she is five and we picked it for a bed time story a couple of weeks ago. I just felt embarrassed reading it to her; it seemed to make no sense. We agreed that it was rather goofy. While trying to be serious! I guess maybe that's why we abandoned it before the middle for one of our old favorites, Mariana and the Merchild. Glad so many of you enjoyed it though."
3,It's Okay,"The title of the book says it all, if this is what you believe. I thought the story itself was a bit, how shall I say, silly? I know it is a kids book, but I was hoping for a little more depth than what was in it. Maybe my expectations were too high. So I say this book is ""just okay""."
3,amazing art work,Some of the pages of this book I could just frame the art is amazing. I think the text was over the heads of my 4 year old class. I am saving it until the end of the year when they are all 5 and maybe they will get it. I think it would be perfect for a first grade class to read and make their own art to go with it.
5,Good Investing Section,"I am a recently divorced mother of two and didn't have a clue about investing. I read this book because it was written by real people who aren't financial experts. I guess I thought I might be able to understand it and that it would deal with issues I face. I was right. I liked the book and have loaned it to my sister and she likes it too. It's a quick read and it held my attention throughout. Now I'll need to start reading some of the other books recommended in this book. Thank you Tooheys, for sharing your experiences and showing me how it's done."
4,Fast read with some good but general tips (good motivational book for beginners),"I read this book whole in about 4 hours, while also taking notes on its contents. It's a fast read. Most of the real ""tips"" are actually the titles of the chapters of this book, which say it all. It's a very simple message: first, you will have more money if you learn to get out of debt and spend less; second, once you have more money, grow more by investing it. There is no magic trick or formula - it's all about old-fashined self-discipline and biting the bullet (ie, shopping generic, not competing with the Joneses, using old stuff as long as you can, avoiding expensive entertainment and activities, etc.). Rather than informational, I would classify this book as MOTIVATIONAL. It is a very good book in that sense, because the authors are examples for everyone: they are ordinary people who managed to save nearly half a million on a very modest income."
1,"Not great, advice is outdated, too much bragging","This book is an easy read, easily done in one or two days. The book starts in 1991 and the family seems to live in the country. They talk about their money all throughout the book, how they saved thousands over many years. That does not inspire the struggling family nowadays. Their strategies deal with how much you can do without, keeping children at home all the time. They spend ALOT of time reading. The last 2 chapters almost preaches how to raise your child, nothing to do with financial matters. It was OK reading, I had a few days to take a mindless break."
1,Not Good @ All,The writer needs to direct us to real contacts. Explain beeter where to go and who to ask for? I am still looking for a good finanial book for the working class....
4,A Fan not Foe,"I really enjoyed the book. Especially when I was able to use it to make a friend (studying to be a psychiatrist) believe that I had MPD! True this is fiction, but some are real expiriences whether or not this man has expirienced them. While it seems laughable in it's extremity, it's not too far off should you isolate the events rather than lump them together. In any event, it makes for captivating reading. I have been reading it over and over again since I was about 12 (I first read it's prequel, Dead Air, when I was 10) and am reading it even now."
5,grandmalucy,I bought this adapter to go along with the Vsmile for my grandson so they wouldnt have to worry about batteries. Perfect accessory.
2,Air Battles-Find Another Game,"Air Battles: Sky Defender- The Air Battles game just simply does not work- it locks up my computer, has poorly defined menus and although it will recognize my joystick, the game won't utilize it. Pass on this software- even at $7.95 it's just not worth the frustration. FWIW- I have a modern, up-to date computer and I'm fairly adept with it. In short- Air Battles: Sky Defender is just not a good game product."
2,Not too bad,This is a pretty good game. The menu is a little hard to understand. The in-game aircraft is not as responsive as it could be but what do you expect for a 16 dollar game. I cannot find a free combat sim at this time so I cannot compare. Would I buy it again? Not when I can get better non-combat flight sims for free.
1,"Same as ""What Happened?""","It loads perfectly, but will not open & run. I get an error message every time and it has to shut down. Zero on the 'fun scale'."
1,AIR BATTLES / SKY DEFENDER,"...do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this one, it has great grafics if all you want to do is sit and watch but if you intend to fly forget it, i still can't configure the joystick buttons to work and the flight model is way too sensitive, you'll be all over the screen trying to fly while other planes are shooting you down...the only thing that works right is the ""bail-out"" key."
4,Just Enough Serbo-Croat,This book is designed to help you get around a Serbo-Croat speaking environment with ease. I think the book is capable of providing the basics needed to get around. I would recommend this book for foregin travelers.
2,Not too happy with the book,"This book is written in more Croat ""language"" than the original and true Serbian language."
5,McCutcheon makes math fun!,"Full disclosure: I haven't read the book yet, but Mr. McCutcheon was my math teacher in 6th and 8th grade and all through high school, and he is singlehandedly responsible for making me comfortable and confident with math. He made math class both fun and challenging, and taught in a way that forced us to use our brains creatively rather than simply memorizing formulas and spitting them back. If this book is anything like his classes (as the title suggests it is), it would be a wonderful resource for teachers, students, and anyone interested in increasing their knowledge and enjoyment of mathematics."
5,Disturbing.,"I was ten when I read this book. I'm 13, now, but am still haunted by the story 'Drawing The Moon'. I have never read anything more disturbing in my life. I don't really care as much about the other stories, although they were quite good, but if you want to be seriously disturbed and disquieted, read 'Drawing The Moon'. Seriously, now I am afraid of the moonlight. To really get the story, you have to look at it a certain way, and really think about it. The other stories were very good, but not really that scary or anything. I liked the first one by Bruce Coville, it was descriptive and imaginative, giving creativeness to the old yarn of what's under the bed. The one about Death driving the school bus was also an excellent story. I think it's in that collection, I have't read the book for a long time."
3,Good- Has Potential But Not Quite Realised...,"This KC album has it's good and bad stuff. The title cut parts I+II have flashes of brilliance but gets drowned out by a lot of noise (as with Yes 'Tales From Topographic Oceans'). 'Easy Money', 'Book Of Saturday' and 'Talking Drum' are good songs but the best by far is 'Exiles' in which we have a wierd beginning and then a nice segue into the rest of the song with Fripp's acoustic guitar, Cross' soothing violin, Bruford's soft & jazzy drumming and Wetton's true talent coming out of his relaxing vocals and bass riffs. Buy this album to get a feel of KC from this period and if you like it then go for the other stuff and enjoy. If not then your loss is limited to afew good songs that you can enjoy and ignore the rest."
4,"Unsettling , unforgettable , with unique instrumentation","King Crimson uses part of the rock language ( with the instrumentation ) but adds something extra that makes the listener uneasy . The music is similar to their first album in that there are heavy songs put together with much lighter toned ones .Though I like the album a lot , it's not one I listen to for pleasure . If you were driving at night and were lost , this would not be the music to have playing .Beacuse a lot of the music is instrumental , the listener can conjure up mental images .It is intense and I recommend you hear it first before buying ."
3,too harsh for my taste,"After listening to ""Starless and Bible Black"" which i thought was very good and had many beautiful moments, i was disappointed by Larks in that overall it sounded very dry and dull. I fail to see what KC was trying to do when they recorded this album. I wish they would have said something about that in the newspaper clippings in the albums liner notes. Until i hear something about their purpose behind this album i cannot apreciate this album from the standpoint of a music fan, there is just no emotion like there is in a Yes or Beatles recording. ""Book of Saturdays"" is an ok song and ""Larks..pt.1"" is slightly interesting, but other than that i'm sorry i got this cd."
2,Overrated album,"I am goin' against everybody here, I just don't like this cd and I gave it to a friend of mine. The title track (part II) is the only one that I can listen too, but not too often. Sorry everybody, but I can't rate it as a five stars album just because everybody did."
1,A blind alley,"I think that, because of his frustrations and problems with the precedent formations of King Crimson, R. Fripp needed to take a revenge. It's a pity that the victim was the fan."
2,Pretty bad really,"I really like King Crimson's first two albums. And ""Islands"" is pretty good too. But this one is way too odd and freaked out, more like avantgarde. Not really my thing, I prefer KC when they're a bit more melodic.Let's see how many ""Not helpful""-votes this will get..."
1,Nothing worth a 2nd listen,Nothing worth a 2nd listen here.But if you want to download the best King Crimson then download justEpitaph > Moonchild > Court of the Crimson King > The Return of the Fire Witch > The Dance of the Puppets
5,Amazing,"A beautiful, timeless and delectable mix of surrealist lyrics and blistering musical build-ups that swirl around the listener obligation he or she to deem it nonsense until he or she truly wants to an EXPERIENCE out of the music. I have heard few albums that make me wish that Amazon's scale allowed more than five scales. This is one of them. This album should please fans of progrock, jazz and even classical."
5,King Crimson's Fourth and Final (?) Masterpiece,"I needn't waste words: as with their first recording (""In the Court of the Crimson King""), the consensus is that ""Larks' Tongues"" is a masterpiece. Nevertheless, it is perhaps noteworthy that this is the first truely ""rock"" album by KC. The group had, by now, become a ""basic"" rock ensemble (electric guitar, bass, percussion, drums, with the important but essentially subordinate contribution of violin). Gone were the dominance of mellotrons (""In the court of the Crimson King""), saxophones, piano's and flute (""Lizard""). The King had shed its clothes; Fripp had entered into power. And with Bruford (drums) and Wetton (bass and vocals) to back him up, he suddenly seemed quite muscular. Noteworthy too is ""Larks' Tongues in Aspic Part One"": this remains the best track recorded by KC since 1973. Like ""Bolero"" from ""Lizard"" or ""Starless"" from ""Red"", it is, furthermore, an example of perfection in modern music."
3,"3 STARS FOR THE EDITION, TOO MUCH MONEY FOR CASSETE BOOTLEG STUFF","KING CRIMSON IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE BANDS, BUT THIS BOX HAS 7-8 CDS OF ""HISTORICAL"" MATERIAL ""CASSETTE BOOTLEG"" QUALITY ONLY FOR FANS, AND THE PRIZE IS TOO HIGH FOR THIS KIND OF STUFF (EVEN IF AMAZON USA HAD THE LOWEST). THE REST IS REALLY GREAT, WITHOUT ANY DOUBT."
3,Oddly lacking in spark ...,"... by which I mean in comparison with their live performances. Musically, this is a complex, disturbing album; however, to my ears the production, although clear and forward, is rather dead and cramped sounding. And frankly, both parts of ""Larks Tongues"" need to be speeded up.Listen to the the live set ""The Night Watch"" to hear just how capable these guys were of taking off. As it is, the sound here remains earthbound.The best moments are the mosaic-like ""Lark's Tongues Part 1"" and the lovely ballad ""Book Of Saturday"".One more thing. Despite being praised to the skies for his eccentric genius, Jamie Muir's percussion sounds to me like a man falling down a flight of stairs."
4,Exiles in search of a style,"Larks' Tongues In Aspic, Part One/Part Two...very good 2 part trackBook Of Saturday - Crimsos attempt at the mainstreamExiles - The Mellotron is backEasy Money - poor mix on otherwise good songThe Talking Drum - same as easy money, the mix is inaudible until the last few minutesAll the experimental household gadget percussion, garbage can gongs and swinging motorcycle chains courtesy of short-lived member Jamie Muir. He was an big percussion influence on Bruford, so I guess he served a purpose in this chapter of Crimson."
3,Not Bad for a White Boy!,"OK, Here's the rundown - LTiA1 is pretty cool, although it runs a bit too long in my opinion. Book of Saturday is an agreeable little tune with very nice vocals. Exiles will remind you of the first couple o' KC albums.Easy Money is similar to ""Cat Food"" and ""Ladies of the Road,"" The Talking Drum is pretty much a complete waste of space, and finally LTiA2 is one of the best rock and roll tunes in exsitence and is pretty much worth the price of the CD alone.""Red"", ""Discipline"", and ""The ConstruKction of Light"" are all better KC CD's, but if you're a fan this is definitely worth the purchase."
3,Not as good as I remembered,"The trouble with trying to remember why you liked something 40 years ago is the context of the time is missing. While sonically this reissue is fine the music itself doesn't stand up to the test of time very well and is the reason I give only 3 stars. Maybe its my fault for not trying to get a copy of the music before buying (my original album has been long lost to history) but it seems very dated. The music lacks coherence and a feeling that the sound has an overall goal or purpose. This could be just me and others who remember this album fondly may be very satisfied, but for me this was one I should have skipped."
5,here's my suggestion,"Go to your local music store, as I did.Buy this 1 CD, 1 DVD setListen/WatchWorth it?In my opinion, YES"
4,"Yes, it's flawed.","Fine musicianship and expansive dynamics abound. However, this album is marred by John Wetton's horrendously off key and whiny singing. Exiles makes for particularly excruciating listening."
5,Crim gets scary,"LTIA was the first in a trilogy of albums in which Crimso was attempting to prove that they were the scariest, most intense band in the world. They succeeded here, although I feel they truly upped the ante on the succeeding LPs, ""Starless and Bible Black"" and ""Red""--most particularly the last-named record.LTIA Pt. 1, with its whisper-quiet intro and loud, dissonant middle section, declares this intention immediately. ""Easy Money"" proves it further, especially with the evil canned laughter at the end. ""Book of Saturday"" is a lovely, abstractly despairing track. The whole album is mesmerizing, and for me, LTIA, S&BB and Red represent the best period in the group's choppy history, especially after the near-misses of ITWOP, Lizard and Islands."
5,one of their best,"From hypnotic to disturbing, sweet melodies to discordance, has it all. My college son says Easy Money stands the test of time sounding oddly new."
5,Ann Rule has a unique perspective on murder,"As a long time reader of Ann Rule, I was very pleased with the newest addition to my library. She has an uncanny way of getting you into the minds of both the murderer, and their victims. This book hit home in an unusual way; Cunninghams first wife, ""Loni Ann"", worked in the same Kinsiotherapy clinic as I did. She was a very lovely woman, but quite shy and quiet,in an unnatural sort of way. She let on very little about her past, and after reading this book, I can understand why. Ann Rule took me into the life of this woman, as well as Bradly's other wives, allowing me to understand how dangerous a conniving, narcisstic and delusional individual can be. I thank her for that."
1,Boring,Such a very dry and boring read. Had a really hard time getting through it. Big disappointment .would not recommend .
4,Pure Evil!,"I hope that Cheryl's sons will grow up to remember what a brilliant and coragious woman their mother was. I also hope that Brad Cunningham will rot in his prison cell!!! The more I read about Brad's background and his marriages, the more I was convinced that he would be capable of murder - it's just too bad that so many children had to suffer because of his manipulation and temper! I don't understand, though, why Cheryl did not ask someone to accompany her to the gas station - she knew she was putting herself in harm's way! I just don't get that."
5,This book is THAT good...,"Here is a book that takes you on a long but fascinating path through a wife killer's relationships in a way that makes you shiver in disgust and terror. She brings Brad Cunningham to horrific life on the page...you are witness to his multiple marriages and the sadistic brutality that overtook each of his wives. She nails the true sickness that was his narcissistic, neglectful treatment of all of his children, especially the three boys from his marriage to Cheryl, the victim. The passages of his crash-and-burn self defense in the criminal trial would be laugh-out-loud hilarious, if the case were not so disturbing and tragic. With each book, I am incredulous at the way Ann Rule crafts these cases together like a sturdy quilt. It's truly amazing."
3,It's Not Her Best- It's Still Her!,"To be sure, this is still an Ann Rule book and true fans like me will be satified, but just satisfied. The true crime tale is well -written and well- documented, with good Oregon background. The main fault of this book, in my opinion, is that there is so little suspence! We basically watch as spectators until the wheels of justice apprehend and prosecute ""whodunit"". On a more picky note, I believe Cheryl is not as compelling a victim as other female characters in other A.R. books. As always, don't dwell on those centerfold pictures. They may (or may not!) give things away too soon."
3,Not Ann Rule's Best,"It's incredibly easy to become an Ann Rule Addict, but not with this particular title. ANY other book she has written shows off her true- crime reporting skills to much better advantage. She IS the best..... of course read this title too, but only after you have read all her others. Her subject here, Brad Cunningham, is different from her other subjects in that he lures women who are not the usual vulnerable victims. Rather, they are moxie medics and lawyers who should have known better. Makes you want to box their ears for letting themselves get trapped by him. All the characters are on the boring side. And it's difficult to keep track of those with similar names, like Brad and Brent"
1,"Come on, what's the point here?","Why would an author choose a good story like this, only to give it away from beginning to end? From the author's point of view, was there ever any doubt what Brad was capable of? But who besides the author knew that until there was a murder and an investigation into his character. I felt like I had been cheated and would have preferred the story to be told to the reader in the very same fashion as it unfolded to every person related to the crime including the author. The old cliches, ""And this was the last time...., it was the most important case of her life..., never again would she......"" Come on, what's the point here? Give the reader some credit, we can read between the lines. And let us have the opportunity to make up our own minds about character flaws and as to how that motivates a person to murder. I found this book totally biased from beginning to end and with no social redeeming value. This will be my last Ann Rule read."
4,Excellent True Crime,Ann Rule rules in this genre. This is a well done chronicling of a sadist and his eventual downfall and imprisonment.
5,All you could ever want to know about a monster and his victims,"Rule caught my attention quickly. She starts with the crime, the relevant people, and then brings us back to the murderer's childhood. From there, we see how he develops into a cold-hearted murderer. He's married multiple times, each time abusing his spouse. (Save for the marriage of convenience) We relive the night of the murder, and then we become immersed in the hell through which he puts two more lovers. We read how he abuses his children. We have this monster before our eyes and we want justice. Rules provides details of the his fall from ""glory""."
4,Chilling and hypnotic,"I have an addiction - I pick up true crime paperbacks in airports (they make great plane reads.) Ann Rule's DEAD BY SUNSET is one of the most fascinating I've ever read...and among her very best. The profile of sociopath and ""malignant narcissist"", Brad Cunningham is so searing that it's chilling to think that there are others like him walking around...hiding their evil behind charm and intelligence. It's also a great tale of ""justice will out"". Excellent work, Ann."

2,"Saeco Vienna Deluxe Good Coffee, Not so good plumbing","WE bought ours at Costco in January 2003 and it provided excellent coffee until yesterday, July 3, 2005. However, it is a temperamental appliance, and after a year it began to develop vacuum locks in its water system which occasionally required a handyman husband to dismantle the Brew-group to break the little clear plastic ball bearing valve free. MOre recently the water simply didn't pump through, not because of scaling, but apparently because the pump had given out. It is not easily disassembled, and there is no way to service the thing at home . . . If anyone has a suggestion for a more reliable automatic espresso maker, we're in the market."
3,In Shock and Awe,"I found out that a local Bath Bed and Beyond (Rockville, Maryland) carried this same machine and was allowing customers to use this machine in their store. I loved the expresso that it produced and the Saceo Vinnea is a big step up from my $200 Starbuck's Saceo Barista. However, I was shocked that it is mostly made of plastic and that the buttons have a flimsy cheap feel to it. I did expect the plastic to have a better feel; so it was dissapointing to me. Other than the lack of a cup warmer, its short frothing tool, and its plastic body it makes a good espresso. I could not over look its plastic body and and this price I think that you can do a better with Starbuck's Saceo Italia. It cost $530 and it has better buttons , a metal body, a cup warmer,a ground coffee bypass and, a better frothing wand. In my opinon if you are going to spend $600 on an espresso machine this is not the one to spend it on."
1,Extremely unhappy,"I am extremely unhappy with this product. It did work well for the first year of light use, but since then it has been a nightmare. 2 times in the shop well over $100.00 at each wack. Parts for it seem to be very hard to get as it takes well over a month for the shop to get it. Communications with factory rep and parts department are almost impossible to get through.Stay away from this item, it is not worth the money."
5,The Perfect Gift,"My girlfriend gave me one of these last Christmas. It seemed kind of extravagent at the time but I was glad to see it. I have thought for years that freshly ground beans, like fresh cracked pepper, are superior. This machine does it all, it grinds, tamps, brews, dumps - all you have to do is fill it with water and beans, dump the daily grounds and rinse the spill catcher ocassionally. It makes great espresso or cafe americano (at infinitley different strengths, also one or two at a time), steam or hot water (for frothing, tea, instant soup, etc.), and virtually cleans up. It makes easy, high quality coffee products and looks good..."
3,Good Coffee / Unreliable Machine,"This machine does make great coffee. You must follow the directions for brewing and maintenance exactly as listed. That being said, I've had mine for about 9 months and it's been in the shop twice. Once for a bad pump and once for some timing mechanism thing that just stopped working. Customer service at the 800# was horrible earlier this year but they seem to have improved quite a bit. Since mine was a gift and I did not have the receipt, they did not honor the warrantee so save your paperwork!"
1,Do Not Buy This Machine,We have had this machine for 3 years and it has broken three times at $100/repair. It has just broken again after being fixed a month ago. I have had it and I am going to try a Delonghi machine. Save your money and forget Saeco it is poor quality.
3,Great Machine Better Built in Obsolescence,"We've had the machine for over 3 years and yes, we use it every day. That said, when you purchase a machine at this price, you expect it to perform over the long haul when it is used every day for only two people. We have used it at parties, perhaps 4 times in the three years we have it and only to make 6 - 8 capuccinos or espressos. Nonetheless, it no longer pressurizes (Panel is no good). As perfect as the coffee is, we will be looking at other options."
5,I love it.,"I read it 2-3 times, and I love to read it again an again! ;)Actually I bought this one for a friend, who like to know more about persians. :P It's a great idea, isn't it?!"
5,"Loved it, laugh out loud funny~","You don't have to be Persian to appreciate this book, I thought it was an absolute riot! I recommend!"
5,"So funny, so real","I laughed out loud through most of the book. I could relate to many of the stories but I would have never imagined describing them in such an amusing way!!! Great Job, Great Stories, Great Humor."
4,"Resonant, Poignantly Delightful","This autobiography, written as a compilation of short stories, resonates strongly among not only Iranians, but also other immigrants to North America.Having said so, it also helps those of us not living in the United States understand how intolerant the American Melting Pot can sometimes be and appreciate the ethnic harmony that is Canada."
3,"Not very funny, not very Farsi","Is this the new DaVinci code? One book about the Templars and soon the libraries are full of them. Now it's Iranian women and the trials of their lives. I expected more laughs and more culture clash. Humorous? Yes. Funny? Not too much. Several chapters do not even take place in the USA, several more have NOTHING to do with being Iranian, so the subtitle is borderline deceitful when it states ""growing up Iranian in America"". Her father's scholarship, her trips as a child from her home in Iran to the Caspian sea, her husband's plan to honeymoon in India, babysitting nightmares, her trip to Paris: what do they have to do with growing up Iranian in America? Nothing. Simply humorous anecdotes about her life, much of which have nothing to do with American vs. Iranian cultures.And how did she learn English? That is entirely left out of the book. One chapter she knows nothing more than the names of colors, the next she's an interpreter for her mom."
4,Funny in any language,This is such a fun book! Anyone who has ever felt like an awkward outsider will enjoy this book. I had the pleasure of meeting the author in real life and she is as delightful as in her book. She spoke to a group of high school students and was such a hit!
5,Excellent!!,"A fabulous book!! You'll find yourself laughing out loud many, many times. It's heart-warming and touching and yet light-hearted. An absolute must-buy!"
2,A few highlights but mostly disappointing,"Tries very hard to be hilarious but doesn't succeed. There are several amusing stories but I feel that she writes at the expense of her family. Perhaps her family does not mind this - I think I would. Short vignettes, some quite poignant, as when her father lost his job and when there was so much anti-Iranian feeling after the Iranian Revolution. It was disjointed - going back and forth from when she was 7 to when she had kids, then back to high school, then to her wedding. I was mildly disappointed."
2,Not so funny- Amazon,Somewhat entertaining but several spots where it was slow and seemed to drag on at times. It seemed very melancholy from the writers view instead of funny.
3,Insights into Iranian culture,Father's memories of America and the realities of bringing his family often made for comic times. Fun to read.
5,very funny and entertaining book,"I read this book a few years ago in high school and it was very entertaining. Having immigrated from Iran to US, I could relate with many of the stories in this memoir. I would recommend this book to anyone interested about Iranian culture or in general immigrants from other countries and the process of integration into American culture."
4,Light read on a book on an immigrant family,"The book got funny later on but at first seemed like she was sucking up to Americans. She also tries hard not to associate Islam with being Iranian, Supposedly her family only celebrated the Persian New year."
3,Cute,Fast read and funny. Its a good beach book. After reading it I was curious about what hapened to the family as time went on.
2,verey superficial,"I bought this book because I was really craving a book written by an iranian so I could relate to... The book is well written if you want to have some fun laughing at extremely superficial issues about iranians living in the US, but totally lacks a real understanding of the situation. In few words this was a teenager book although I would not even recommend it to teenagers to read"
2,Wish I'd read it in Farsi,"Funny in Farsi? Maybe. Not so funny in English. I found it stale and unsurprising throughout. The characters didn't come through, the episodes seemed forced and shallow, and I gained little insight. On the positive side, it was fairly short."
2,"Too shallow, even for summer reading","It would have been wonderful if she wrote it to share with her family and friends, but to publish it? There is no substance, it is not particularly funny and it is just plain boring. This book proves that not everybody needs to write a memoir.I've been married into Iranian family and I recognized a lot of traits she is describing. The book was amusing, at times. However, I would not recommend it."
5,Hilarious Insightful Memoir,"I absolutely loved every word of this book. I read it in one day. It was so good that I could not put it down! The writing was superb -- clever, witty, and descriptive without being wordy. She has a gift for describing painful situations in such a way that they are funny and educational without any hint of bitterness. It really made me think about things from a different perspective and feel so proud and lucky to be an American. I am a better person for having read this book -- and in a much better mood. I don't want to spoil any of these stories for those who have yet to read this gem, but they are hysterical!"
5,I almost pulled an ab,"""Funny in Farsi"" is a light, short memoir of a young girl and her family's adjustment to life in America. It was, as many others have written, laugh-out-loud funny - so much so that I almost hurt myself - and very touching at times, too. Firoozeh's story will resonate quite stongly with readers, Iranian or otherwise, who have shared some of these experiences, but also maybe with those who haven't."
5,funny in farsi,This is the best book I have read in a long time.I would recommend it for anyone who is looking for sensibility in this otherwise insane world with the spice of laughter put in.
1,"The book speaks of the writer's weak English, hence it is too elementary",The only folks this book maybe funny to are the type of Iranians who have little mastery of the English language. I found the writing skill to be too elementary for anyone with educations beyond the high school level. I have to say that I have not read the Farsi translation of it which incidentally I have heard is much better than its English version.
1,When Shallow meets Pen,"I could not handle Ms. Dumas book. She uses repetitively ""don't get me wrong"". She jumps from one subject to another with very little background explanation: suddenly, we find her in France bathing in the MED. She brings an idea up, but never expands on it. For instance, she decides not to change her name, and her only reason because the day she wanted to change her name a friend with the same name came to visit her. Don't get me wrong, there are thousands names in the English language for girls that she could have chosen.As an emigrant to the US, I thought she will bring some insight about what she learned here, and what makes both cultures different. Unfortunately, one learn about this culture and her culture, and her writing makes her look shallow, in spite of a her graduating Cum Laude."
5,I highly recommend this book!,"Funny in Farsi is a great book, not just because of Firsoozeh Dumas's great sense of humor, but because it is down-to-Earth and fun. I love how Firoozeh's family gets into all sorts of crazy situations, including, but not limited to, getting separated at Disneyland, taking ""exciting"" trips to Vegas, and learning how to swim.Though the book is laugh-out-loud hilarious, the meaning goes deeper than a bunch of immigrants trying to find their place in America. It shows that anyone can be American, no matter what ethnicity they are or where they come from. A true American is defined by their spirit.I enjoyed this book and highly recommend it for people of all ages!"
4,America Is Still a Melting Pot,"With the Arab-American Comedy Tour taking the country by storm, this is a timely read. The cultural confusion that the author's family undergoes when moving to America is not uniquely Iranian, yet the Iranian elements add a unique perspective that other ethnic groups might not experience.I laughed a lot at the predicaments of this family, and through the author's insightful eye I was able to see sides of America differently. It usually takes another culture for us to understand ourselves, and this book helps in that regard.I recommend this book to anyone interested in assimilation, growing up in America, and a good laugh."
4,Funny In Farsi: A Memoir of Growing Up Iranian in America,"The book Funny in Farsi by Firoozeh Dumas is a great book that captures the author's life in America as a child and young adult. The author is a female Iranian who learns to adapt to her new life in America. She recalls her experiences in depth and shows how hard it can be to be from a different country and especially in America. Many other people who have come from different countries experience the same types of obstacles that the author went through. Coming to America from a different culture and country is difficult for anyone. At first, I was not sure if I would enjoy this book since it was non-fiction and I have not read many non-fiction books that I enjoyed. This book proved me wrong. It was fantastically written and I felt like I understood exactly what was going on with Firoozeh. This book was wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good non-fiction book."
4,Delightful and Funny,"I really loved this memoir.It's funny, an easy read, but not a frivolous read by any means. I wanted an insight into the Iranian culture and got it! It was written in small chapters that were scattered throughout the author's lifetime and the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was that I would have preferred it to be chronological. There were times I was unaware at what age the author was during a particular chapter and it threw me off.A delightful book full of humor, insight, tolerance and love."
5,Fun read!,"Funny in Farsi is a fun, easy , funny look at the author's life. She humanizes a culture different from our own while making us realize how much we are the same. I enjoyed it so much I immediately read it again. I want my teen daughter to read it. It has much to offer."
3,Funny in Farsi,"It was a cute book, and I would rate it between 3 and 4. Some of it was cute and funny but overall, I was a little disappointed."
4,"Like Ed says, eat, sleep, dream knives...","I have to mention that I am a big fan of Ed Fowler and try not to miss his articles in Blade magazine. For those not familiar with his style, Fowler presents a bladesmith's techniques, thoughts, and philosophies in an entertaining style, free of the technical jargon that clutters similar books on knives and knifemaking.For the non-knife enthusiast, this book is still a fine read and you may end up converted (like I was, many years ago).For the 'knife nuts' this book should be on your table to be read and reread until you are too old to read anymore. Great stuff, Ed!"
2,For Knifemakers Only,"If you are a knifemaker, then you may appreciate this book. If you're a fan of Ed Fowler, you may appreciate this compilation of previous articles for a magazine. As a person interested in knives, I was more interested in learning about different materials, hardness scales, knife functions, styles of knives, and the like. This book does not address those issues. I don't care to learn how to skin a rattlesnake, buy dying sheep for their horns, and I'm not interested in Ed Fowler's dating and subsequent marriage. I didn't expect to get story (with no instructions) about knife sharpening. All in all, the book was very disappointing."
1,Blade articles in book form,Ed Fowler is a advocate of the triple quench. This has no scientific basis. He also in the past has advocated edge packing which is impossible. He has created a lot of useless hype about his knives and methods.
4,A journal of an exceptional woman,"""Johnnie"" Fisk mixes memories of a rich life with ornithological observations during a birdwatching expedition. Remarkably human."
4,excellent,the first time i saw kylie in stret fighter i thought i was in love . later i found out she was a singer i bought impossible princess and was very happy with the album .
4,Not for me,I bought these books for my daughter she enjoyed them I am sure she likes this author and so that is why she got so many
3,Not at all the best in series....,"I have to say I read the first two within three days and read the third after. I was dissapointed incrediably with this book. This is my least favorite out of all the books in the series. I still think you need to read it just so you can understand some of the parts in the next two books. I just found this book to be boring---it was nothing like the first two at all. No action, no twists...it just fell flat...but it shouldn't stop you from reading the first,2nd,4th,fifth in the series! I gave it a three just because it's part of a great series."
4,The Mediator 6,"Meg Cabot's The Mediator 6 brought my attention to it from its mesmerizing plot. She has written this series very well. Every chapter is a cliff hanger and leaves u wanting more. It is about a teenager named Susannah Simons who is a mediator, meaning she can see and talk to ghosts. Trouble strikes fear into her when she hears that her fellow mediator, Paul, wants to keep her, nineteenth century, ghost boyfriend from ever dying. That would mean that Paul would have to go time and stop a heinous murderer. ""' I promised I wouldn't kill him,' Paul said.' I didn't say anything about keeping him from dying in the first place(13).'"" Can Paul go to the past with out killing him self? Will Susannah be able to foil his plans? You'll just have to read The Mediator 6 Twilight to find out."
4,Reunion,"Suze's best friend, Gina, is visiting her for a few weeks. Suze would be thrilled but a pack of teenage ghosts are trying to kill the school geek, Michael. Things get even more complicated when Michael develops a crush on Suze.There's not much I can say about this book that I didn't say about the first two. The series seems to have settled into a pattern of murder mysteries revolving around Suze's latest love interest. That isn't necessarily a bad thing though and the book was still a fun read. I will certainly continue to read this series with enthusiasm."
4,Shocking Blue,"Who knew what Shocking Blue did aside from Venus? This double CD is full of cool songs! It's fun to try and think what genre and what time period you would put them in - rock and roll, alternative, country alternative ... every song is a little different. Good value and a nice addition to your collection."
1,Beware!,"The audio quality on this 2 CD set is just plain awful.It's as if all the sound tracks were all old records played on a crappy old record player with a worn out stylus though dinky little AM radio sized speakers, then miced with some crummy cheap microphones then re recorded on junky old consumer grade recording equipment that was badly in need of cleaning and adjustment. It's as if all the sound is compressed but with no expansion.The quantity is there but there is no quality or dynamic range. I couldn't fix it with an equalizer either because you just can't put back what isn't there to begin with.This is not at all the artists fault but the recording and production is wanting and leaves much to be desired. It assaulted my ears and pained me so much to listen to it, it's going into the plastic recycle bin. That's too bad because it sounded like there were some really good songs on it. As it is, it's not worth the plastic that was used to make it."
2,Incomplete!!!!!,"Even if the staging is quite good, and the singers are competent,specially the Lulu, one amazing singer, (the conducting is not remarkable ) be warned: this is a Two Act version of Berg's masterpiece. I can't understand why some people insists in doing one unfinished version of a work that since 1978 is very well completed by the Austrian composer Friedrich Cerha. Berg wrote the essential of the music of the third act. The third act, that isn't played in this DVD, is essential for the complete understanding of the work. The Mise - en - Scene kill the characters in the second act trying to explain the history without the real end. Don't miss your time and money. Go to the DVD recorded in Glyndebourne. There you will have a first rate conductor, a fantastic staging and a complete performance of this sensational opera."
4,LULU Naxos,"Excellent version but not the best. 2 acts and a half. That's good, that's what Berg composed...We don't need extra music provided by other people! The version is nice but I suggest the Christina's version (3 acts)...If you don't want the 3rd act, just skip it!Martin"
1,Bad translation,"This is a terrible translation of the original Rivera work. If you want to get the real feeling of ""Y No Se Lo Trago La Tierra,"" read other translations. This does a great disservice to Rivera and his work."
3,Cheap enough,screws that came with it weren't black headed so you need to paint them. No wiring harness included. No template (not needed anyway)
1,Be warned: this is a novelization of original poem,I just purchased this book and looking through it discovered that this is not the original edition but made into a novel. The book is both a poem and prose and magnificent. It is a novelization of the poem and I discovered this too late. I have a leather edition of this book and it is magnificent but I wanted it as a kindle book. This is not the same book. I should return it.
3,Sadly outdated,"As most O'Reilly books, this *was* an outstanding, readable, and indispensable guide for Tomcat development and administration. Unfortunately, it's sadly outdated: this book only covers version 4, while versions 5, 5.5, and 6 introduce many, many innovations and changes, and you don't want to waste time reading material that doesn't apply to the current versions. It is unfortunate that this book is still being for sale. This book has well deserved stars, but those starts are now obsolete. We all Tomcat lovers are looking forward for an updated edition."
1,rushed and shallow,"while the book may be useful for getting started/familiar with tomcat for system administrator new to JSP/servlet containers, the coverage is very shallow. touches on subjects without getting enough depth to be useful (optimization, security).i get the sense the book may have been rushed. it's understandable, perhaps, given that as popular as tomcat is, there is dearth of printed documentation for it, and author/o'reilly felt the need to fill the gap asap.revised edition with in-depth coverage of various parts of tomcat would be welcome (but the software changes quickly enough that printed publication like this may not be able to keep up and be profitable)"
5,"Solomon Northup's Odssey: ""Twelve Years a Slave""",Very Good Film. I enjoyed every mintue of the Film. Sorry it ended so soon.
4,"Important, but not necessarily good....","Xie Bingying was many things. Unfortunately, her autobiography does not convey this well, reading like a nationalist propaganda piece. She also did not write much about the political context of the times in which she lived, although I suspect that was deliberate. Her story is still fascinating, however, because of how she navigated the shifting social intersections of China in the turmoil of the early twentieth century. To understand what women went through during this period, this is a valuable resource. I wouldn't recommend it for casual reading though."
3,All these issues can be found in Frank Miller DD Vol.2,"I bought this book and Frank Miller DD Vol.2 at the same time. Even though i enjoyed the reading it, I was dissapointed to find that all of the issues printed in this are foud in Frank Miller DD Vol.2. So if you already have vol.2 dont get this."
3,Review of Miller's 'Daredevil: Gang War',"A fair, but fairly uninspiring addition to the Miller Daredevil series. There is less thematic thrust and character development here than in previous volumes I have review. This isn't a terrible collection, but Miller has done better."
4,Daredevil: Gang War,"I personally love this trade for so many reasons. I thoroughly enjoy the dark edge Miller gave daredevil in the 80's, the intense battles with not only the enemies (Bullseye/Kingpin) but using rival gangs, and good old drama with his outstanding storytelling. I have always been a fan of Frank Miller's art with daredevil and the blend of fighting techniques that he gives the characters which gives the reader more vivid excitement from page to page. Noone has been able to touch his art/storytelling since and reading these older issues reminds me of why I am still a Frank Miller fan even today."
4,Attractive book with lots of information,I have only read it through and have not been able to use it on our trips...could be our kids are too young and we have so much work moving the kids from point a to point b.
4,great book for Smokies visitor,I actually got this after I went to the Smokies. It is very informative and will take it on the next visit.
2,Not much functionality over MS Money 2000,I got disappointed by the added functionality. It is not worth paying (price)when you already have MS money 2000. Bill screen is worse than 2000. Disappointed.....
2,Better data exchanged for rotten performance,"Money 2002 corrected some of the calculating errors in Money 2001 such as bills not being included in the budget report even though they appear on the budget screen. However, the performance in the budgetting section is HORRIBLE. It takes my computer 30 seconds to make even the slightest change to the budget. Apparently it's related to the number of bills you have. I was so frustrated I switched back to 2001. I would rather live with faulty reports than spend an eternity trying to generate an accurate budget. Money 2002 still doesn't total columns in the investment reports either, so I keep having to get out the calculator to find out if my tax forms match the data on the computer! What's the point of using a computer?!"
4,GOOD money program,"Its user interface is very friendly, It defenitly helped my finances. I can see my savings and losses.....could have a little more features...and the charts and graphs are hard to read sometimes....specially the bar charts.Its worth a little less than what you pay for , but it is still a good deal. I got my rebate quickly too!"
2,A Step Backward,"In Money 2002, the all-important task of creating and sending electronic payments has become a massive headache. In all recent versions, regular payments were a snap to set up. If your electronic payments, called Epays, were set up in advance, each one could be recorded and batched to send to your bank later. In 2002, Money prompts you to log into your service provider everytime you record a payment. It requires multiple clicks and dealing with a succession of annoying pop-up windows to continue. The time to pay bills has at least tripled! Money fans should stick with 2001 until Microsoft fixes this."
1,"Don't force me, and hey, I paid for this!","Just some facts:1. If I don't want to register the software, please leave me alone.2. I don't want to become passport member and don't want that server to have my information.3. I do NOT want to see any ADs in my ""paid"" software!"
4,"Ok, but too much reliability on the Internet","They are making Money more and more like you're expected to have a broadband 24x7 connection to the Internet, plus there are several other annoying features like the necessary Microsoft Hotmail/Passport account necessary to login. Also, the online synching is very poor, can't even cancel it in many cases when it takes FOREVER."
2,Happier w/ 2001,"So far, I haven't run into anything besides minor annoyances. The only saving grace for my upgrade from Money 2001 was the price after rebate -- free.So far, my biggest problem with 2002 is the constant effort to direct me to Passport and MSN. Internet Explorer pops up a ""MoneySide"" sidebar that I finally figured out how to turn off after over a month. I can't say how much I resent this ""feature."" I would prefer to pay retail price for a product that won't advertise constantly.The only new feature I find myself using is customizing the ""home page."" It's a very nice feature, but I'm not sure if it was worth the aggravation I experienced in my first month.From my perspective, upgrading from 2001 would not have been worth it if I had to pay anything over [$$$]."
1,Forget Support,"I've been using Quicken for nearly 10 years and decided to switch. At first I was impressed with Money 2002 and decided to scrap Quicken.Now, whenever I attempt to download information from my bank or brokerage Money crashes. Repeated messages, calls to Microsoft support don't help. They constantly suggest reinstalling many aspects of the OS, IE, etc. Which I did, and it still doesn't work.The support people have the typical attitude that you don't have a clue and that their software would never be the problem.After extensive debugging with Visual C++ I found a conflict between a device driver on my Toshiba and Money. If I run in ""dumb mode"" on Win Pro 2K, it works. Once I run with all the device drivers that are required for the notebook computer to be useful, it fails.MS Support is unwilling to elevate issues to development. They have a ""until we get around to it"" attitude. Guess that's what you get with mass market software."
4,excellent web integration and customizability,"pros: background banking is awesome and the ability to do customized homepages is sweet. web integration better than quicken. the online manager is much more intuitive than previous versions. cons: taxcut is still inferior to turbotax. basically no skins like quicken, only the default money colors"
1,Needs Work,"i purchased money02 deluxe and find it to be a waste of money. I have had a difficult time managing anything and keeping track of anything. I find it is not user friendly, and a seemingly stubborn peice of software. What I mean by stubborn is if your particular financial situation happens to be somewhat out of the norm then good luck attempting to enter it in money02 deluxe."
1,Maybe later folks!,"Have read all reviews for MS Money 2002 and Quicken Deluxe and can only say this Oh My God please let me stay with Money 2000.My Credit Union says download with Quicken. Money 2000 does not recognize it. I am happy with MS Money 2000, can track all moneymatters with ease. If it isn't broke, don't fix it."
2,Electronic payments are a big negative in Money 2002,"If you use Money to make electronic payments through your bank, 2002 is a huge step backwards. Through an inexplicable design error, gone is the ability to quickly queue up a series of electronic payments and then connect to your ISP and send the payments in a single batch. Don't the Money software designers know how the banks work? Many financial institutions charge by the connection and it takes a minute or two per connection to send your payments and get a response. If you don't use Epays, Money 2002 is a great product. Otherwise, wait for a new release or a patch."
3,Problem closing passport when quit,"The other review pretty much sums up the functionalities of this software. I do want to raise some problem that I encountered. If you choose to login use passport with your Money software, and when you are done, you quit, assuming that it will log you off. It's not the case for me, even after I shut down the program, my passport session is not over.... I have to kill the cookie manually or go to hotmail and logoff manually. It is very confusing."
2,another money downgrade,"i have been a loyal money user. once you start with either money or quicken, you are pretty much locked in to continue using the same product. 2002 money has been the poorest upgrade yet. it is interesting to see what improvements microsoft implements and what they end up screwing up all at the same time. i will be returning 2002 money for a refund. the one feature i can not live without was removed. in the scheduled bills area you can not highlight upcoming bills and see your account balance. i removed 2002 and am back with 2001 money."
4,Great Old Songs,"I play these for my 3 and 5 year-old grandsons. We have a grand time singing along with ""The Name Game"" and ""The Clapping Song""."
1,A great disappointment!,"I've been an avid Asia fan from their inception so I was very excited with the release of this live compilation. Unfortunately my excitement was short-lived...The sound is so horrendous, I literally disconnected my speakers to check for faulty wiring. With today's technology, there is no excuse for not cleaning up the noise from these performances. In addition to poor sound, some effort could have been made to edit this collection (do we really need 3 versions of ""Heat of the Moment"" and ""Only Time Will Tell""???). Asia is a hard-working group of artists...too bad the same can't be said about the technicians. I can only hope that if a DVD is ever released of Asia in concert, someone will take the same care in recording it as the band does in giving us their music."
1,"Asia Quadra, What a Disaster","As a long time fan of the original lineup, I thought this 4 disc set was finally going to put to rest my long suffering soul that was dying for a definitive release of Classic Asia live. I cannot believe how poor these recordings are. Why can't someone release a decent soundboard of any of these shows from 82 or 83. I have cassettes from this time period which are probably as good if not better than this fiasco. If you gotta hear Asia before the breakup, well there's not much else around. (besides the other Zoom Club Records debacle ""Asia, Alive in Hallowed Halls""). I certainly can't believe that Carl Palmer doesn't have anything better than this garbage lying around his collection. Then again though, this is still a lot better than anything by the current lineup. Hard to recommend for anyone besides the absolute diehard."
1,A Terrible Recording,"No matter how big a fan you are of Asia, Steve Howe, Yes, ELP, King Crimson, etc., DO NOT BUY THIS! It is a horrible, horrible product. I've read others warning of this, but I bought it anyway, figuring it couldn't be that band. I was wrong. The sound is dreadful. You can hear audience members talking louder than the band is playing. There are much better bootlegs out there. I couldn't even listen to this once. It would have been great if the sound was even radio-quality, but it sounds like it was recorded from the hallway on a dictation system. It is a total disgrace that this was ever released by anyone associated with the band."
1,I felt robbed.,"First of all, I did not purchase this from Amazon, but from a small outlet mall somewhere in Pennsylvania. I was quite excited to find a collection of concerts from Asia's original line-up. However, my excitement soon turned to dissapointment and disgust as I realized that tis was nothing more than a crummy, poorly recorded bootleg. Unfortunately, I discovered it too late to take it back, as I was on vacation when I purchased it. Be warned: If you buy this you are making a mistake. There are far better live cd's out there. Read the reviews!"
3,Sound is Fair at Best--Asia Concerts,"This a four cd set of 4 ASIA Concerts in the eighties. The sound on 3 of them is fair but one (cd 2) sounds muffled and mono. Each concert for the most part has the same songs except for some solos by band members. You have got to be a real Asia fan to love this 4 cd set. I like the concerts but I wish diffent songs were used at times, because it was getting sort of boring at times. Being an Asia fan and collector I had to get this box set. No booklet in this box set or any linear notes--- what a shame!"
1,"Yep, this is lousy....","but if you're really desperate for the original line-up, blow your money on it. Live at Nottingham is better (no Steve Howe) & Asia in Moscow (again, no Howe) are better. Even the Live in Hyogo is of better quality. Do you really want to hear Heat of the Moment 3 different times in one box set? You can't find the Moscow concert anywhere except for a 2-disc set called The Asia Story, it's got one disc w/Wetton solo material & the Moscow concert on the other. If you must buy this garbage though, get it on CD Universe for about $16"
2,Dreadfully disappointing,"Can't add much more than has been said. Sound quality is dreadful. I tried to look past it, but after a while I couldn't and sold it on an auction site. At least we now have quality recordings of the reunited lineup playing live."
4,ASIA - DIE HARD,I have just received my copy of QUADRA and I have to say that this is a fantastic collection for me as a fan. The boxset is top quality and although the music is not soundboard quality it didnot put me off getting hold of this piece of music history. I have other Zoom Club boxsets including Phil Lynott Live in Sweden and Grand Slam and have to say top marks for finding these releases and making them available.ROCK ON !!
5,It's a miracle,"It's a miracle itch reliever. There is nothing else like it on the market. We live in a woody area and cannot escape mosquitoes, so I always have After Bite on hand as soon as I walk indoors."
3,Middle of the road again,"I followed this book immediately after reading Agent of Influence, and found my sentiments from that one bleeding over to this one as well. Again, I appreciated that it moved quickly and I could finish it in a long afternoon on the beach, but the story was SO cliche. I didn't mind that it was terribly dated, but again...it's all been done. So...3 stars."
3,Cute but there are better,"I bought this one and the Grandpa one as a Christmas gift to my parents. They're cute, but I wasn't blown over. I think there are better books out to spend your money on, like ""I Loved You Before You were Born,"" or ""Wherever You Are, My Love will Find You."""
2,Review,"My main impression of this work by Becher is that it is far from to the point. The author strives towards assisting the reader in making their own decision, which as such is not a bad idea, but it results in the book missing an adequate structure. Time and time again the author gets lost in details, quotes, and footnotes, while the reader has no idea of the the bigger picture since that is not presented until much later. The practical application of the theme of the book (classification of academic disciplines - only twelve of them, by the way) does not come until the very end.If I'd recommend this book it would be for the lack of something better. For those enjoying a good, clear, to-the-point and enjoyable-to-read textbook this one would not be the right choice."
2,I wish this cd was better,"I Wish is about the only good song on the CD. Everything else is just mediocre. Do yourself a favor, just buy the I Wish single and leave the CD's sitting on the warehouse shelf."
1,Repeating,"This CD starts off well, the second track is of course ""I Wish"" the big hit, but where does the song finish? Track 15 I think. On the next album. Wow. I wish things would drop on his head. Like cars."
3,"Skee-Lo's hit I Wish was catchy back in 1995, now its old","When I purchased Skee-Lo's I Wish CD back in August 1995 I thought that it had some tight music on it like I wish and others without the swearing. But now in 1999 it is ancient history of rap. Now, swearing in rap seems to be more of a cooler trend and bands make it seem cooler like Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, Master P and Mystikal. Skee- Lo seems really gay now and doesn't appeal to me at all. But remember that was back in 1995 that was 4 years ago, music has changed since then. If you like slow R&B with no swearing and if you like old school rap music you'll like Skee-Lo"
4,a very funny black comedy about what divorce may make you do,I saw this film at the Florida Film festival and it was great. A few very funny plot twists and a wonderful cast of characters. A fun rental!
5,Saeco Vienna Superautomatica Espresso Coffee Machine,I bought this coffee machine as a Christmas gift for my parents. On Christmas day we set up the machine - which consisted of putting coffee beans and water (always use filtered) in it and plugging it in. We read the enclosed quick set up and away we went. I knew Saeco is one of the leading coffee machines - which I researched - but I had no idea how good this machine really is. Not only was the taste exceptional - but the aroma was also wonderful! What they really liked about this machine besides the excellent taste - was the ablility to make a fresh cup of coffee each time. There was no coffee pot to wash - virtually little clean-up. For the price and quality - this is well worth it.
1,You get what you pay for,"This machine is a problem. It has broken down several times needing repairs. I should have opted for better quality machine at a little higher price. Doesn't heat coffee enough, leaks, flimsy parts."
4,Great machine until it breaks,Can't find parts anywhere! Repair facilitys are very limited and none in my area however the machine lasted five years so i give it four stars.Heating element burned out!
1,OK perfromance & Bad customer service,The superautomatic function works ok but the steam unit is greatly underpowered. A $29 Krups makes better steamed milk. After trying Saeco customer serverice several times I finally got through only to get zero help. Under engineered product and below par customer service is a bad combination.
5,LOVE IT!!!!,"We have had our machine for over two years and we are still as much in live with it as when we first bought it! We have started a trend among family and friends and these machines are popping up in all their kitchens. Wonderful news for us because it means we have fab coffee when we visit them. We don't have a concern with changing bean types frequently but, it would be nice to have a larger water tank and grounds drawer(mostly because I am the only who remembers to refill/empty the machine). Highly recommended."
2,"Great machine, at first","When I first used the machine I was very pleased. I made roughly 20 shots per day on the weekends and about 4 per day during the week.The machine functioned well for a while, then after a few months the grinder began to go nuts. There is a small plastic flapper at the end of the grind chamber that is supposed to turn the grinder off when the grind chamber is full and trigger the machine to dump the grinds into the brew group. Sometimes the flapper performed and sometimes not. When the flapper didn't work the machine would continue to grind until one shut off the power or it ground up all of the beans in the hopper. Then a messy clean up was in order to remove all the grinds from the machine.I tried to remedy the condition as best as I could, then one day when the machine was about 10 months old I had enough. In the big green can it went.Loved the machine at first, ended up hating it. I will not travel the Saeco road again."
2,Broken,Bought a new one and wouldnt work when I recieved it. Sent it back (paid 30 dollars to ship it back)Then when it was fixed it worked for about 2 weeks then broke again
3,No chords written out for you to learn to play.. No chords in back of book .,I had to buy a book of chords to figure out the chords for the first song.....This First Fake Book book has no chords printed out at the top of the page of the song.......If we could see the chords and practice first the chords......Then we could play the song with ease....First you have to go find the chords needed for this song from somewhere.. Write down all the chords needed......practice these chords.....now you can put both hands together and play the song.........would be so much easier if the chords had been printed out at the top of the page to glance up and see and practice.. Some books have chords printed in the back of the book...NOT this book. I had to buy a chord book ...I don't consider this a First Fake Book... The first song has at least 8 chords to play in in the song and they repeat. I think I should have bought The Piano Guy book. Im going to look for that book.
1,Only if you are a raw beginner,"To make this easy they have made some compromises in the chords they use. The print is large and easy to read, but you may have to turn pages. I am no music theorist but I found the G7 chord with the C note not pleasing in the key of C. This occurs often. I found F7 better with C. The Easy Fake Book makes some of the same compromises but seems better. In addition it provides an introduction to each song. I use the Ultimate Fake Book when I want to learn, the Easy Fake Book when I play for relaxation, and the First Fake Book seldom."
4,Engaging,"I agree with a previous poster regarding the album cover art work, it is nearly equally as spacial as the music. Many have written with detail regarding the works of this band and it's many guest hosts. I will say that side 1 will live forever in my mind, it is dramatic and melodic all at the same time. My favorite bit is Prince Ruperts Lament and Robert Fripp's guitar work, simply genius. I also favour Indoor Games as it might pertain to anyone you know, cough, hint, hint."
1,THE WORST CRIMSON ALBUM,"Don't bother. The only thing worth noting is the guest vocal on ""Prince Rupert Awakes"" is Jon Anderson of Yes."
4,Still Enjoyable,"Although certainly one of the weakest Krimson albums (not saying much, is it?) this is still a pretty good album. The album is more of a whole expirience for me rather than a track-by-track one, which isn't a bad thing. The whole feel of the album is extremely Jazzy and progressive, which works well. The weakest link is definately the vocalist Gordon Haskell, as another reviewer said, he sounds amateurish and very weak compared Greg Lake. The high point of the album is the 23-minute Title track, especially the Prince Rupert Awakes track, in which Jon from Yes guest vocals. The lyrics are also very good, more exotic and strange than before.Overall, it is a great and underrated album from the ProgGods of King Crimson."
3,"Art, vinyl and pretentious jazz","I will try to describe this complicated album in a simplistic way.Lizard is a piece of art. No doubt about that. Experimental jazz, tales, rock, orchestra, laughter. But even good art has not only got supporters. And this album is not my taste of art.I bought Lizard because it's supposed to be King Crimson's best album - and because Jon Anderson sings on Prince Ruperts Awakes (the first part of the 23 minute title track) which is definitely the album's highlight, together with Cirkus. The rest is so much giggeling around and blowing horns to de-jazzability that it becomes kinda pretentious. It undoubtedly remains a piece of art, though.If you can get hold of the paper sleeve instead of the jewelbox, then do so! This one is refreshingly provoking: it's simply the original vinyl album cover and inner covers reduced in size! Brilliant! And a needed provocation to all the drawbacks of the CD age!"
2,King Crimson at their worst!,"My God, what is this? Certtainly not King Crimson! Or at least, not the King Crimson of Red, Discipline, In Court or Islands. Now, to do them justice, there is ONE really good piece in the album, the instrumental Bolero/The Peacock's Tale. The preceding vocal Prince Rupert Awakes, is not too bad, either. But apart of this, this album is a disaster. To see what I mean, all you have to do is play first samples from In Court, then play a bit from Lizard's first side and then play Red. You'll see how far behind Lizard is from those landmark albums, as well as from anything else King Crimson has done. In Court, Red and Islands all have an inernational, universal I should say, appeal: Their music is timeless. Lizard, on the other hand, presents a sample of overblown, pretentious, pseudo-progressive British music."
5,I'm Surprised No One Mentioned Happy Family....,"I agree with all the reviews about how unbelieveably good this album is. All the earlier albums, up to Red, are wonderful. But I noticed no one caught that the song ""Happy Family"" is about the Beatles. Look at the drawing on the album cover and read the lyrics again. If anyone else figured this out, I apologize for missing your mention of it."
3,One of the King's most fascinating misfires...,"As this album shows, King Crimson was off the mark often enough, at least on these early albums, to be lumped in with the rest of the indulge-o's in the prog hey-day. Songs like 'Battle of The Glass Tears' and 'Big Top' are sorely in need of a riff-laden rave up from guitarist Robert Fripp. Indeed, like the proceeding '...Posiden' LP, Fripp's role here is overshadowed by the album's more jazzy tendencies (chalk this up as well to Fripp's commendable generous ego; a virturosi with restraint--quite a rare thing). Fripp instead contributes the often eerie, boggling neo-classical picking on tracks like 'Cirkus'. Lyricist Sinfield's post-hippie, acid-burnt words were at the height of their ridiculousness here, but they mesh well with the bizarre arrangements. All in all, this definetely is no jumping-on point, as it were, but it may be the album that every Crimson fan may someday want to own."
3,Mad Dr. Fripp concocts a strange brew on Lizard.,"By the time of their third album, Lizard, King Crimson was not so much a band as a musical laboratory run by mad musical scientist Robert Fripp. Interchangeable group members would come and go through his revolving door, but Fripp's warped view of the universe remained the one constant. The album meanders through assorted weirdness (Cirkus, Indoor Games, Happy Family), while the extended Lizard song suite harkens back to The Devil's Triangle, a disturbing exercise in dissonance from the second album (In The Wake Of Posiedon). By the time Mr. Fripp closes the album with his wailing, sustained guitar solo, only the most hard-core of Crimsonites will bravely remain under the Big Top. A difficult album to digest for the uninitiated, but recommended for the more adventurous listener. (Album highlight: Yes vocalist Jon Anderson's guest appearance on Prince Rupert Awakes.)"
4,Genuine avant-garde music from a group in transition,"Lizard is perhaps the most experimental album from the progressive band King Crimson. It encompasses feelings of a circus-like atmosphere in the beginning to a rather midevil feeling toward the end, especially in the last song (Jon Anderson of ""Yes"" guest vocals!). Overall it is a solid group effort, however, it lacks star power from other musicians besides Robert Fripp. The group was a couple of years away from the great Bill Bruford and vocalist/bass John Wetton joining. Instead, we have to settle for Mel Collins and other minimal musicians. For those just getting aquainted with King Crimson, buy their basic albums (In the Court..., Larks...). One bit of interesting news: I bought the album Larks Tongues in Aspic 2 years ago at Tower Records in Philadelphia knowing nothing about the band except Bill Bruford drummed for them. Since then they have quickly risen in my list of best bands of all time. They are probably number one."
5,CRIMSON AT ITS MOST BIZARRE,"I love this album, even though I can rarely listen to it. ""Lizard"" has astonishing jazz sections that morph into hard and prog-rock. True, Fripp himself rarely picks up the guitar as often as we are accustomed, but the sheer weirdness of it all makes up for his absence. I mean, this album is WEIRD. It creates a state of mind and emotion like no other pop effort I know, and I have heard lots and lots of music from every corner.As one reviewer noted, ""Lizard"" is art. Not always pretty, not always immediately intelligible, but you won't forget it if you really listen."
3,I Can Take It or Leave It,"Lizard gets three stars from me: it is just an ""average"" album for them, with pitfalls surrounded by a few gems, but it never reaches the heights of In the Court... or Larks' Tongues. To be sure, rarely does it reach the lows of Islands, but that album is just around the corner. The whole album has a rather ""cold"" aura on CD, as if the original recording (in 1970) was somehow done digitally. Sure, there are some clever lyrics and great Fripp acoustic work, but there's not too much good electric guitar, and the second half starts to grate on ones' nerves after a while. It's nice to see Jon Anderson show up, and the cover's beautiful--but it's hard to believe that this is the same band responsible for one of my absolute favorite albums of all time, Larks' Tongues In Aspic."
5,Finally an extra long necklace that's nice!,"Its taken me forever to find a really long necklace that looks nice, feels nice and isn't going to break after one little tug. And this is it! The rope link is stylish and delicate looking whilst still maintaining a toughness to avoid breakage. This chain looks great with any pendant hanging off of it and I'm currently deciding whether to buy another one. Probably!"
5,Nice Chain,This is a very nice chain. It is a very bright light silver color and so it doesn't go with some of my sterling silver pendants which are more of a stainless steel color.
3,Pretty necklace at a good price,Great necklace; very pleased with the price & quality. Long enough to be a nice layering necklace.
4,best multi playa...,This is one of the best multi player games i have eva played not only that it is fun younger players can play too (kinda no blood) there is alot of mini-games if u beat the story mode!!! i played it for x-box and i had to get the game. I bought it two days later. It is definitly worth the money. get this game if you like shooting games!!!
5,Timesplitters 2,"Okay, imagine all of the James Bond games, gameplay better than any first person shooter, excellent controls, and an incredible multiplayer system ALL IN ONE GAME!! This game is incredible. There are so many features, and I have finally found a multiplayer game better than any of the Bond games. This is a must-have for any PS2 owner, no matter what. I would buy this game just for the arcade mode, but soemhow, Eidos has also made a great Story Mode, where there are objectives to coplete. Also, in addition to regular arcade mode, there is an arcade league, which is personally my favorite part of this game. If you don't buy this game, you have no clue what you are missing out on, this is my favorite game of all time!!!Ifyou buy this ame, a multitap is definatley necesary to get the full potential out of this game. 4 PLAYER IN THIS GAME RULES!!!"
3,Time Splitters 2,Game is pretty fun but its for an old system so the graphics aren't good but it still is fun to play
2,"Hmmn, is this really the succesor to Halo?","No, it isn't. Not even close. Bland story, decent gameplay, subpar graphics. It's not as emmersive as Halo ever was. And compared to te Red Faction series, this game isn't even close. Nice level editor and multiplayer, though I wish it was online."
5,THE BEST SHOOTER GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!,"Goldeneye has met its match. Timesplitters 2 has great graphics, awesome gameplay, and good replay value. I also like the multiplayer story modes. This is the game you pull out when your friends want to play a good shooter game."
5,great game,"this game is great for you and your kids, But its not appropiote for younger kids though. I had a great time playing it, and i cant wait for Timesplitters 3 to come out. I overall rate this game 5 stars because its probobly the funnest game ive played in a while."
5,This game is a must have.......,"I have played the last Timesplitters quite a bit on the multiplayer side and this one is twice as good. 126 guys to unlock and choose from, lots of levels, cool map making, and great graphics. The single player is 100% better as well, making a great overall game.The multiplayer is the reason why I bought the game and it hasn't disappointed. I haven't unlocked everything yet, but there are some many options, you sometimes don't know what to do. Some of the levels have remote guns that you can use or huge cannons that you can get behind and fire rockets at your buddy. Great stuff. Get this if you know what is good for you."
5,"Up to 4 players, fun, addictive, action-packed, etc.","Everything is fun on this game rather you play by yourself, 2, 3, or 4 players. You can go on missions. There is also something called arcade where you set your own bots, guns, music, time limit, etc. That is the most fun. There is a mapmaker feature where you create your own levels. And the last thing, for single player only there is something called challenge which you do levels in a time limit or other things. You break windows within a time limit, you snipe people and youll lose if youve been spotted, etc.OH YA AND I ALMOST FORGOT, it has an ONLINE MULTIPLAYER feature!!! Its free!!! you battle other players in any level like in arcade. you can join one's game or start your own.This game and socom II are my 2 favorite gun/shooting games."
5,i link compatible!!,"Does anyone know that this game is i link compatible!?! does anyone even know or own an i link!?!? well i do and i can tell you that this connection: 2 copies of Timesplitters 2, 2 PS2s and 2 separate TVs , makes this game 6 stars!! I have read many reviews here, and not one mentioned the i link. That is by far the best multiplayer option. I absolutely hate being able to see my opponents screen and vice-versa. Maybe you've played HALO. Now I do believe HALO is a better game because of scope, music, vehicles and the ability to JUMP! But Timesplitters 2 is definitely a contender. My question is why aren't there more i link compatible games!?!??! The locales are excellent and the music fun. If you do have an i-link it's tricky timing when to press the buttons for the load sequence, but it gets better after time. I feel like I am the only person on Earth that knows about the i-link..."
5,This game is th coolest shooter game ever!,"The arcade mode is the best part of it! Your can play capture the bag, team death match, or a deathmatch! Even though the story mode (for 2 player to!) is very hard and is not the best i still give it an 5 *!"
4,Energy Suspension / s13,There exactly what i wanted.Master bushing set with just abut every major suspension bushing one could need / want.Good quality / well labled and packaged / instructions are sufficent.Paid i belive it was 111.00$ for them on Amazon where as i couldent find them any cheaper then 150.00$ on just about every web site.Took about 4 or 5 days to get my order using the freebie shipping option.This was for a 91 nissan 240sx s13
4,We never did too much talking anyway.,"RCA Records wanted to follow up Aloha From Hawaii with a new Elvis studio album in 1973, but all they had to work with were leftover recordings. The songs that ended up on the album were all recorded one or two years before. The first two tracks were taped in March of 1972. Six of the tracks date from May of 1971. ""(That's What You Get) For Lovin' Me"" is from March of 1971, and ""It's Impossible"" is a live recording from February 1972. Despite the hodgepodge nature of the album, it's actually pretty good. There a couple of weak songs, like ""Love Me, Love the Life I Lead"" and ""Padre"", but the rest of the material is pretty strong. There are three great songs where Elvis is alone at the piano: ""It's Still Here"", ""I'll Take You Home Again Kathleen"" and ""I Will Be True"". I'm also fond of ""Don't Think Twice, It's All Right"", which is sloppy, but fun. Most Elvis fans should enjoy this album. But I should mention that it's only 26 minutes long."
3,Ace back support,This is a nice back support but wish they had them in sizes. One size does not fit all. It is too big for me and I have to sew extra velco on the support. The velco that comes with the support does not last very long. I was glad to find this on Amazon because I have not found them in the stores.
3,"Good product, but not discribed well.",The discription of the product did not mention any metal stays. Also the product did not say it was non-returnable and that the packaging would be damaged. There was a note saying these things included in the mailing.
3,Beware - it is a bloody chess book !,"After reading ""Killing Suki Flood"" which is one of my all time favourites I ordered the new Robert Leininger Book ""Middlegame Strategy"" as soon a s it was out. Other than the Suki Book, which is some sort of a Tarantino-esque action thriller, ""Middlegame Strategy"" ia actually a chess-book with nothing but 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.c3.f6 etc. and I doubt that it is written by the same person. I do not play chess therefore I cannot comment the quality of this book.(The only reason I gave it a rating is beacuse I had to enter one - please ignore)"
5,Sonomas finest punks,"A good, fast, fun album bringing me back to the good days out there in Sonoma county. Where every thing is layed back and oh soooo green. If you like NOFX, Good Riddence etc.. Definetly check Dave, Justin, Mike and Greg"
3,pretty decent pop-punk,"This cd is on HOnest Don's (as opposed to Fat) apparently because Fat mike didn't like half of it.. The cd's kind of a blend of older NOFX and Green Day. Most of the songs aren't really energetic, but a few are fantastic, such as ""titty twister"" (listen to Survival of the fattest for a better version of this song). Overall, this is a pretty solid release, and better than most Fat stuff."
2,Ok,"I wasn't all that impressed with this book. Half the book is spent on generic topics (filler I guess), and when he does finally start talking about routers the explanation was unclear to me."
2,somewhat useful.,"I expected a little more from this book. A router is a very important tool in woodshop and it requires careful attention to safe operation, proper setup, and very precise measuring for accuracy. This book does not go into depth in this area. I didn't feel that the techniques were properly explained. The book was ok and I'm sure some people, especially beginners might find it useful."
2,Thumbs Down,"I heard ""Impatiently"" on the radio and immediately had to know who the artist was. I went right out and bought the CD thinking that if this obviously talented man could put forth such a beautiful song as ""Impatiently"", then surely the rest of the CD would have much to offer. WRONG!I was sorely disappointed and haven't listened to the CD since. It's not the worst I've heard, it was just a let-down. I expected more. I would say...see for yourselves. Find a way to hear it before you buy it. Then make a decision."
3,Good but not essential,"While Ride's first full-time album ""Nowhere"" really deserved 5 stars, I would rate this subsequent album with 3 stars only. ""Twisterella"", ""Time Machine"" and the gorgeous ""OX4"" are standouts, but the rest of this album lacks inspiration and makes too much row without memorable melodies or structures. ""Nowhere"" was a more consistent and enjoyable record. Ride's mid-'90s albums ""Carnival of Light"" and ""Tarantula"" were a complete departure from their well-known noise-rock sound, I'm sure other Ride fans can tell that, too. All in all, ""Going blank again"" is worth the money, but I recommend you too look for the accompanying EP releases. The ""Twisterella EP"" contains three previously unreleased tracks, among them the theme ""Going blank again"", which is not featured on the album! The ""Leave them all behind EP"" contains a alternative version of ""Chrome waves"", and ""Grasshopper"" (11 mins.)."
4,A great CD from my original college days,"This album made Ride a little more palatable for the casual listener, which should have really given them some sort of success because this is good record. The arrangements are all really simple, but still sound great with all of that distortion and layering washing over them. I saw them at the 930 club for the tour of this album and they were excellent. I had seen them previously for the Nowhere tour and they were with Lush. That show wasn't so good. Hmmmmm... Wish I could go dig the CD out of storage right now."
5,to this day I can still find a song to suit my day,"A pivotal album that changed the style of shoe-gazing and brought muddy guitars and heart felt vocals into a deeper arena. Probably one of the best albums which covers a great song to dance to (leave them all behind), a song to swing your hips to (twisterella), a song to be angry with (mouse trap), a song inspired by genius (crome waves), .........and finally a song to contemplate life about (OX4). The brillance of this album comes from the brilliance of Ride on stage and capturing what they do best - play live. Songs are genuine and real, music is complex and inspired. Compare it to Nowhere and get a feel for the progression in what was Ride. Truly brilliant."
4,It's a cracker!,"The beautiful noise that drapes these songs, all feedback and fuzz, usually puts pop loving people off, however, these songs are just so strong the effects add to the overall package. The result is a quality CD, it shows a band reaching its artistic zenith. While Ride had shown they had the goods on earlier efforts - check out Nowhere and the lovely song Sennen from an earlier (and now sadly hard to find) EP - they, unfortunately, were never this good again."
3,Maddening but necessary,"Until we get a decent recording of this wonderful score, fans of Rodgers and Hammerstein will have to settle for this stopgap. Providing only 33 minutes of the show in truncated versions of the songs, this is the only recording of ""Allegro"" ever made. Why did no one think to record the wonderful concert staging at ""Encores!"" a few years back?! If you love Rodgers and Hammerstein, you will want this, but the poor recorded quality and the brevity of the selections are drawbacks. 5 stars for the show, but 3 for the recording."
3,Poorly sung and recorded but the only version available.,"If any Broadway score needs a ""new"" recording, this is it. This was RCA's first Broadway Cast recording - the sound is atrocious. Performances vary. The 78 rpm format allowed only fourteen songs to be recorded - out of 25 - and some of those were abridged. This is one of R&H's most important shows - we need a complete and reverent recording of this work. For R&H buffs and cast album buffs only."
4,I have an original album.,"My husband and I saw the original Broadway production in 1947 on our honeymoon. I bought and still have the 78 RPM album which I get out occasionally and play. Of the songs, I love ""A Fellow Needs a Girl,"" the most -- so romantic. The play was innovative and did not last long, I suppose audiences were not ready for it. But we were able to get tickets without a long wait, and we will never forget the experience."
3,New one in the works,"This original cast album is not bad, but, considering the innovative format of the show, it just isn't good enough. If ever a musical called for a complete recording, this show is it. Well, according to Rodgers and Hammerstein Library friends of mine, one is in the works at last. I will not say who is performing, but it will have some of the best singers on Broadway and opera today.The original just doesn't carry the pizzazz the show requires, and bear in mind that the original show is a very bold kind of show, with a Greek style chorus, consistently underscored dialogue, and a misunderstood""message"" that rubs some people wrong. It isn't about big city life being bad, small towns being good. It's about allowing your life to spiral out of control. This recording preserves the voices, but sonically it shows it's age much more than the original South Pacific does. The new recording of Allegro will be out early in 2009, so let's save our money and wait."
5,A Great Learning Adventure,"Fred Shoemaker, Author of Extraordinary GolfGreat golfers are simply ordinary people who continually put themselves in a learning environment and are willing to risk the ""tried and not-so-true"" in the face of unpredictable outcomes. Ron Mann's ""Find the Zone"" is that kind of learning adventure. He presents the golfer with the opportunity to play freely and creatively and to explore new horizons which may give benefits beyond the game itself."
1,spade was awful,"the spade i ordered came to me and looked like it had be made by a 5 year old. there were paint marks on 3 different places, there was a scratch, etc.the company was great about returning it, but i had to take the time out of my day to return it, but the postal packaging, etc.i wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
5,Just your typical amazing album.,"I love this album, you're missing quite a bit if you haven't listened to it, I just wish it had more songs on it."
2,Cool design but too big,"I really liked the design of this buckle, but found the dimensions are just too big. Like, cowboy belt buckle BIG. Plus it's not nearly as shinny as the picture makes it out to be. This belt buckle would be much better if it was sized 33% to 50% smaller. Bottom line: I wish I had not purchased it and will probably only wear it if I'm putting on a Stetson hat & boots."

4,Nice book. Thanks.,"It seems the readers are staunchly divided; you'll either like this book or hate it. If you read it as a bout of light reading and don't dig too deeply for meaning or what have you, you will enjoy it for the simple play of language, for all of the words bumping each other pleasantly. If you're looking for wit and meaning, I'd stick with the pithier two- or three-lined poems. The longer ones strike me as a sort of absurdist mad-lib, which was a plus in my book, but may not be in yours. Borrow a copy first, to test it out."
1,Don't waste your money,This isn't poetry. It's mindless. It's narcissistic. It's not even clever. But it sure does think it is.
1,give me a break,"What kind of narcissism and boredom leads to publishing a book of lazy spontaneous poetry-slam style performance poems? Especially when they're all based on a tediously repeated formula? These poems are a silly gimmick, a campfire game really, and are trite and trivial beyond belief--clear evidence of the creative nonexistence of these two ""poets."""
1,WORST PRODUCT EVER,"Difficult to build.Shoddy materials and parts.Many pieces are designed to be held together with cheap glue, included in the box. The drawers do not slide open properly. As soon as opened a package for one set of drawer rails, a ball bearing fell out. I'm not sure I will be able to use this thing at all. I am beyond frustrated with this product. I feel duped by everyone involved with selling this product."
1,stay away!!,"my husband and i were looking for affordable dressers and bought 3 of these about a year ago from Target. they are the worst purchase we've ever made, they are flimsy and two of them are completely coming apart. the sides are bowing out and the drawers won't stay in place. now i am on amazon trying to find better dressers to replace them.it's a bummer that dressers are so expensive, but sometimes you have to spend money to save money in the end, and i think that this is one of those cases. :("
3,Not as good as Once Upon a Dream,"Serafina is like a fairy appearance in the woods when Aidan sees her and they fall in love. Unfort, she is about to be married.And that, my friends, is the plot. Do we doubt they will end up together? Not really. Once Upon a Dream is much better."
2,this book was sooo disappointing,"What a disappointment!!!! I loved the Sound of Snow by Katherine Kingsley and some of her other books, and looked forward to reading this book, which I bought used for a dollar. I made myself finish the book because I kept thinking the story would get better or start making sense. The characters behaved so stupidly and situations were so silly, that I'd rate it among the worst romances I've ever read. I was so disgusted with the stupid story line that I threw the book in the trash afterward, since IMO, the book was not even worth giving away (I just wish I could get my dollar back)."
2,Weird book,This book just wasn't my cup of tea. I thought it was really weird and I just didn't care for it. The going back in time was just too off the wall for me.
2,Yech! Shouldn't acid jazz be instrumental?,"This was a disheartening surprise. If you expect something akin to one of the ""This Is Acid Jazz"" compilations, you are in for the same. I would liken this nonsense to a dumbed-down hip hop and rap combination--an altogether unpleasant experience. The label would do well to stay out of this genre before they discredit it out of existence."
4,Fishermen,"Six foolish brothers fished at the river at the spot of his choice. From a boat, from a raft, from a log, from a bridge, from a rock, from the bank. But something is wrong! When each of the brothers counts the others, there are only five!"
4,A funny book to read,"The name of this story is called the ""Six Foolish Fishermen"", and they really are six foolish fishermen. They always get things mixed up and they then get confused. Three of them will only bring their fishing rods, and then the other three would only bring their bait. People will tell them to switch what they have with each other. They then still don't have the materials they needed after they switched. To me, I liked this book and I think that this story was well writen and funny."
5,Captivating real life adventures...,"This is a favorite for me - a retrospecitve on real life adventures of a man experiencing life with reckless abandon, yet searching for something - meaning, fulfillment, legacy...Tony Cohan bares his sole, show his flaws, character strengths and character failings. No glossing over the facts, just tells it like it was. Easy to relate to for those with a sense of wanderlust. His failings are our failings. We experience his adventures as if we were there.A really good read if you like biographies, adventure, character studies...Cohan's ""On Mexican Time"" was also a very good book."
2,"slow read, not particularly gratifying","I purchased this book based on the author's experiences with many artists that have touched my life. I found this to be a slow read and not particularly thought inducing. Perhaps someday as my father is aging I will re-read it and find a new appreciation for it, but until then I would suggest avoiding this one."
1,Do not buy. Drained battery!,"The BatterySaver SE2 actually drained my battery. I hooked it up directly to my battery (they don't mention in the description that if your cigarette lighter doesn't work when your car is off, then this charger won't either...makes sense though). When I hooked it up my battery had enough juice to crank my car. 5 days later when I went to start the car again, the battery was totally dead. Even if it didn't work at all, my battery shouldn't have been totally dead. It was not hooked up backwards, and I live in Florida. It was sunny all week. After my experience I found another review of a different model charger from this same company. That model also drained the car's battery. I would stay away from ICP solar all together."
2,Truely a trickle,"I have used a very similar product before with good results. I take the battery out of my boat between infrequent uses, and attack to the solar charger mounted to a window in my garage. The last time I used the battery, it was dead. I was able to charge it and use it later, so I believe the battery was not the problem."
3,meaaaaa,Received different panel than what was advertised.Will not work when attached to windshield or any tinted glass; requires direct sunlight.Shipped in a couple weeks.Works fine.
2,not worth it,"Am glad I didn't pay full price for this.The workouts were too short and not challenging at all.Instructions were not well cued.I use Ellen Barret and Core Fusions by Elisabeth Hafpapp and Fred Devito,much more rewarding and worth my time."
1,No audio,"I bought this set, and when I got it home, there was no Audio. I took it back and got another one...NO AUDIO! All 4 DVDs! Of course this is not a comment on the quality of the workout. But, I hope that someone looks into this situation of the particular batches that I got."
2,Makes great espresso... for the first 3 months...,"I bought this machine after reading a few positive reviews. I got mine and it worked perfectly well for 3-4 months (using bottled water, descaled once a month). First problem happened- it started to leak. I 've shipped it back under my 1 year warranty, got it back 5 weeks later. It worked for another 3 months after which it started to release steam at all times when mashine was on. I sent it back for repairs, got it back 4 weeks later ( I spent on average $2 a day on espresso :). I worked for another couple months and now it's at the point when my pump is not pumping water through coffee (like not enough pressure). My warranty has ended and I am looking for a new Espresso maker. It is not going to be SAECO. My advice is to get something with longer warranty and maybe more expensive but reliable.I got Rancilio Sylvia now for 2 years - so much happier!"
5,Love it -- makes a superb cup of coffee!,"I've had this model for about a year, and I love it. It is easy to use, easy to clean and makes a beautiful cup of coffee with a thick, rich crema and not a hint of bitterness. It steams milk beautifully and quickly, too. I very much enjoy using it, and would highly recommend this machine to anyone looking for a high quality machine at a mid-range price."
5,I own the Saeco Classico in black,"I own the Saeco Classico in black. I've had it for about 1 and a half years and love it. Great tasting cappuccinos and espresso. It takes a little getting used to, and a little time to make, but once you get it down, its not too bad. You have to really learn and ""know"" the machine, as it will not work correctly if it is not hot enough, or too hot. It is worth spending a little extra time making these considering they are so expensive at Starbucks, etc. I always look forward to my morning cappuccinos!"
4,"Reliable machine, good buy","My husband purchased this machine for me as a wedding gift about 8 years ago. I have only used it once-in-a-while. I used to de-scale the machine monthly, but then the screw knob corroded about 4 years ago and I had to take the machine in for repair at a local shop around Boston, MA. The coffee machine repair-man told me that it was NOT necessary to de-scale a home espresso machine and that the de-scaling powder/solution was causing corrosion of the internal parts of the machine, which led to the corrosion of the knob that controls that steam.SO - I stopped using the de-scaler. I only use bottled spring water in the machine because my local water here in NJ is foul and this will also prevent any sediment in the local water from ruining my machine."
4,"handy product, poor nozzle","This is a handy household product, but I usually pour it into a different dispenser bottle. For some reason, the nozzle becomes loose and the sanitizer drips out the sides of the bottle. Other than that, it's OK. I certainly hope it's as safe as it claims to be."
3,Not What I Expected but Okay,"When I ordered this I thought it was an antibacterial cleaning spray. My fault, I didn't realize there was such a thing as ""Sanitizing Spray.""So now I've got nine of them.That said, I've found many uses for the product:*Inside of trash can / diaper pail*Changing table*Cleaning exterior areas of my humidifier*Kitchen counters*Baby toysIt does have a slight bleachy smell but it's pleasant, not overwhelming (I'm sensitive to smells so if I'm not sneezing you're probably okay)."
2,Marketing genius,Whoever came up with this was brilliant. Add 6ml of bleach to a bottle of water and charge people an exorbitant amount of money. I just did the math and made my own. You can do that too and save the environment by using your spray bottle over and over. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because the spray bottle is good and a decent spray bottle will cost you a few bucks.
1,It's WATER + 2 drops of bleach!!!,"Uh, people, put down the Kool Aid and google ""sodium hypochlorite"" - the only active ingredient listed on the label. Sodium hypochlorite is bleach. So..get yourself a few cups of water, add a couple drops of bleach, sell it to the hordes, and make a billion dollars! Wait, you're too late...Clorox has already done that!"
5,GREAT for Cleaning Anywhere & Everywhere,"I use this stuff like it's going out of style. I love the fact that I can spray down the tray on my son's high chair without worrying about some toxic chemical ending up in his mouth. I use it in the kitchen, bathroom, & everywhere else I can think to use it.It has a slight bleach smell, but it's not overwhelming. I've never had a problem with the bleach in it ""bleaching out"" or discoloring anything. I know that some of it gets on my carpet when I'm cleaning, & this hasn't caused any discoloration.I feel like I am really getting things clean when I use this spray. I've used it for a few years now, & it's my cleaner of choice."
4,review for NFL phone case,I purchased the NFL phone chase for a friend that was having problems finding a case for his common flip phone. This has worked great and it is his favorite team. I was pleased with the quality of the product. Thank you
3,"If you search, you will find it.","Thomas Moore's ""Dark Eros"" has a clear agenda to achieve -- to show that Sade was a genius who saw the reality of the human mind and emotional needs. Unfortunately this agenda clouds his logic at times and limits the quotations and questions he addresses in his book. If you haven't read Sade yourself, please do so before you get this book then judge the comments and theories promoted in this book. This is not to say that Moore analysis is poor or completely incorrect, just that by being so focused on finding the genius in Sade and the sadism in everyday life he is blinded to historical and gender questions and evidence to answer these questions."
3,Could have been better,"My main complain about the book is that I got the feeling the writer was constantly making excuses for his ideas or the ideas of others he was writing about. Like 'we find it disgusting but...', 'this is unacceptable in our society but...', 'for the religious it might sound horrible, however...'. I'm paraphrasing, but this attitude was something I noticed throughout the text. Firstly, this makes the book sound slightly less professional. Secondly, de Sade never made no excuses, so why should one feel to do so when commenting on his writing?The book touched on some interesting ideas, myths and etymologies but in itself, it is not enough neither for getting enough knowledge nor for satisfying some curiosity."
1,Stay Lost In Asia,"Anyone who has spent more than two weeks backpacking in Asia can easily detect the book's lack of adventure, curiousity and soul. After reading the first 2-3 chapters, I could not bring myself to read further. It is apparent that the author had lived a sheltered life prior his Asia experience and has yet truly lived life 'off the beaten path'.Perhaps the author's next title will be: ""Finding Oneself in Remote Asia."""
1,Save your money!,"How long did it take to return a useless book for a refund - less than 24 hours.Really I should not have picked up this book.There is no real insight, useful tips, or real meat to this book. If you're looking for screen pictures well you've found them and that's about all.It's a very cursory, generic overview of Exchange 2000 Server barley touching on any subject in any real depth. Just one man's opinion."
4,Does the job,"I needed a temporary solution for a few days and this definitely did the job. Comfortable, light and easy to fold after use. Good price. It does not come with a pump."
4,sleep good,"Bought for my Grandson for camping, but it is so comfortable I use it in our sunroom all the time."
1,Horrible,Leaked the first time I used it. Contacted Coleman to return but postage would cost 50% of my purchased price. Decided not to waste more money on poor quality.
2,Incomplete,"Its fine, however, it did not have the 'Wrap 'n' Roll' storage bag it boasts about so I'm returning it."
1,Deflated after a week.,"I purchased this air mattress thinking the Coleman label would be very reliable. Mattress was comfortable and easy to inflate using the Coleman pump. However, this ""guaranteed not to leak"" mattress deflated after one week of daily use. I kept refilling with air to no avail. I couldn't tell where it was leaking air since I didn't hear air leaking from the ""air tight"" valve or the mattress. But it leaked down to a sixth of its size overnight. I will purchase a brand other than Coleman."
2,Doesnt last,"It is very comfortable but I camp about once a month and get a new one in the spring and by about the november campout i usually wake up in the mornings on the ground because it loses all of its air. I dont know why, but they never last more than a year and I am not rough on them or anything. Very disappointed."
2,Poor build quality,I bought this mattress based on the brand name Coleman. But this mattress is worst than Intex brand. The Intex mattress atleast lasted more than 8 months. This mattress lasted less than 2 months. Now a big air leak has developed. Can't even hold air for more than an hour. I would like to give 0 stars but gave 2 stars for Amazon customer service. Amazon gave quick replacement even if it was out of the 30 day window. I wish all companies were customer centric like Amazon.
3,"Great Bed, Great Price, Invaluable Function","As an out of state college student I often have friends come visit me at school, but never had anything more than a ceramic floor to have them sleep on. For me it made sense to purchase an air bed to have on hand -- I have already pulled it out several times. No complaints about comfort, it inflates/deflates easily with an electric pump (not included), and won't be horribly expensive to replace when college happens to it.Edit: After about 15 uses over a span of 2 years the bed no longer makes it through the night. A slow but noticeable leak starts after about 4/5 hours and by morning you are on the ground. Will look for similar products!"
2,Save the receipt...,"Good points:* When it holds air, it's a comfortable mattress to sleep on.Bad points:* Filling it without a pump is suitable only for fans of hyperventilation.* It began losing air after a few nights of sleeping on it, and within a couple of weeks it was unusable. I got a warranty replacement from the store, and that one lasted several months of daily use before failing the same way.Conclusion:Like I said, save the receipt. You may get a good one, and it'll last for months of daily use, or a near-lifetime of camping. Or it could spring a leak after just a few nights. If you're going camping far from the big box stores, buy something more robust, or bring a spare. Or find a way to patch them."
1,Don't buy this,"This air bed leaked right out of the box and I can't find the leak. So, now I am stuck with it and the pump. Some stores will not do a refund if the box has been opened. How do you know if it leaks? I will never buy another Coleman product because of this. Keep up the good work China."
1,Puncture the first time out,"I bought the double Quickbed and the inflator. First time out, tent camping, the mattress was punctured and I ended up using it as a ground cloth. No it wasn't on the ""ground"", it was on the ground pad of a North Face Expedition Series tent that was in turn on a tarp.What a disappointment. How could I recommend it?"
4,Decent air mattress,"We've got three of these air mattresses for our kids (my wife and I have a queen size for us) when we're car camping and also to make the mattresses in our RV more comfortable.They're not heavy, they inflate quickly and easily (I recommend the 4D inflator) and deflate and store away just as easily. I leave them a little bit ""mushy"" so that the kids don't feel like they're sleeping on a board. They're far and away more comfortable than the thin little sleeping pads (even the self-inflators) that we use for canoe camping and backpacking.I did puncture one on the sharp corner of our RV door, but that's the only problem I've ever had with them.I was initially using a 12v inflator to pump them up, but learned quickly that the smaller 4D inflator is far superior and more convenient.For the price and the comfort they give you for that price, I recommend them to anyone. You can get better, but it will certainly cost you."
1,Coleman Twin QuickBed,"Buyer beware! I purchased two of these Quickbeds, twin size, to replace one that the valve had torn out. These are more convenient to roll up and store than the prior ones that fold up because of the roll up package so they help break camp quickly. They blow up quickly too, with the proper pump.One of the two developed a leak along the seams after no more than about 10 uses which would be typical of a couple of camping seasons for us. It would not hold air for more than about 2 hours near the end of it's life. This is definitely a manufacturing defect. 10 uses puts the age at about two years after purchase.Coleman customer service would not replace the bed because of the age in spite of their ""No Leak"" guarantee. So the take away here is: Use it often and long during the first year to make sure it will not develop a leak. After that, Too Bad. If you push them, they might extend the warranty to 18 months. A good mattress should last more than 10 times."
1,Started leaking after 15 days...,After 15 days it started leaking completely in a one night. I have to get it replaced .
5,Another Adventure by Lassey,"This book is quite an adventure. This book talks about how Soren and his friends Gylfie, Twilight, and Digger travel to the great Ga'Hoole tree. Soren and Gylfie have just been captured by the horrible St. Aegolius. On the way back they meet up with their nest maid snake Mrs. P. She has been with Soren and his family for many years. When they get there they have to go to their chaw practices. Soon the will be picked for a chaw that is right for them. Soren has a great ryb (ryb means mentor). His teacher is Ezylryb for the weather chaw. Another teacher is Bubo for the colliering chaw. From a 5th grader, I would rate this book a 5. I also read book 1 and it tells the beginning of the adventure."
4,Fantastic,I bought this book for my 13 year old son who had just got his first book as a gift. He got so much into the story that he could not wait for the second one and is now already into the 5th book. I would greatly recommend.
4,Owl Series launches another successful owlette,Book two had an interesting beginning but it explained a little too much of the first book. My favorite part was when Soren got picked to be a collier (who carries coals). This also required him to know the weather. I liked when Eglantine got shaken out of a trance with music.This series has taught me a lot about owls and I'm looking forward to reading more in the series.
3,A little slow but KEEP WITH THE SERIES. The next 4 are fantastic,"I have read all 14 of them (most twice!) and think this is probably one of the four slowest in the series. I will not spoil anything(a good review shouldn't spoil the ending -..-) but I will say that this is a book that is simply a setter-upper and a filler. Some things happen, and it is fairly interesting, but pales in comparison to the rest of the series and other action packed books. However, don't let this stop you. If I were you, I would buy that 14pack that is the last one left, because this is the kind of book that is the ""darkest befor the not-quite-so-far-off dawn"" kind of book.GET READING! =)"
4,Another helping of Hoot,Here comes the Gaurdians of GaHoole is thrill packed sequel: The Journey! In this book Soren Gylfie Twilight and Digger are off to find the so called legendary Great Gahoole Tree. but it will be a great journey to get there and they will encounter Bobcats puffins and Williwaws. and when they reach the tree they will learn it is not what they expected to find! having new characters such as Ezylryb Boron and Otulissa this book though not as great as the first one is definately awesome.
5,Even better than the first!,"The Journey is a great book! I liked it even better than The Capture. In each book you learn more and more about owls, from how they fly to how they catch their prey. I can't wait for the third book, I want to know the secret of ""you only wish!"""
4,Pintacuda,"I bought several different windup toys at once. When I got them, I noticed they had a size difference. Pintacuda is the biggest. The drawback of being big is that it takes more energy to make it move and sustain its motion. The time I spend on winding it up is more than the time I can enjoy watching it dance. But still it's a bundle of fun and sets my desk apart from those boring ones of my coworkers.Pintacuda I got is wearing black shoes. I wish they had sent me one like in the picture."
2,A bust as a gift,I gave this as a gift and was disappointed in its performance. It barely moved. The Critter Windup that I gave to another person was a better performer and danced around nicely. This Pintacuda just isn't interesting and felt like wasted money. But at least it looks good on a shelf or desk.
3,Nothing to exciting.,Bought this toy for my 6 year old who requested wind up toys for his birthday. This one just kind of bounces around nothing to exciting.Fun for the first 5 minutes he hasnt played with it since.
4,"Great, but not definitve","I'll start this review by stating that for the casual fan who is ONLY interested in Elvis's hits, you clearly can't go wrong with this set.However, it is important to realize that much of Elvis's greatest material is missing from this set, most notably his sessions for Sun Records, which was probably the best material he ever recorded. Additionally, none of his bluesy material or gospel is included; the set ""overlooks"" the brunt of his country work as well. Therefore, if you are single set that will give you a summary of Elvis's career, look elsewhere. If you want to hear songs you've likely already heard, this set is for you."
4,PN5004,Very stylish and accurate. Day date and month subdials hard to read without magnification. No instructions are provided on setting the moon subdial. Buy it for looks.
4,Buy It!,"This is one of the best albums for Killing Joke fans and for anyone who loves music. It's dancy, punky and gothy sounding. Song & Dance, Dominator, Let's All Go (To The Fire Dances)...all very good songs. I play this album very frequently. There's nothing bad about this album except that it's too short. Clocks in at 39 minutes."
4,No joke,This release is severely underrated. There's some powerful stuff here that fits nicely in any Killing Joke collection. Go for it.
3,disappointing,"I loved Olivia St. Claire's first two books. ""203 ways to drive a man wild in bed"", and its successor, ""Unleashing the sex goddess within"", were both groundbreaking. ""203"" taught women that sexy is in the mind, and ""sex goddess"" connected them to the eternal feminine mystery of women's sexuality. This new book, however, hasn't much that's novel to say. The philosophy is the same, and I've seen most of the tips she gives in this one in her other books or other people's books. However, it is very erotically written and if you haven't read her first two books, you might enjoy it greatly. Fans of her previous work (like me) will probably be disappointed."
5,Groundbreaking yet easy,"I loved Olivia's first two books because they're fun, sexy, and so easy to dip into when you need a quick tip or some inspiration. This new book is packed with completely new and wild suggestions for a sexy, romantic, or daring erotic encounter. And I really liked all the boxes with extra tips and hints, like The Art of the Quickie (which shows you how to make it hot and enjoyable for BOTH of you). It has lots more variety, novelty, and pure eroticism than most other sex books I've seen. Just reading it make me tingle!"
2,"Been There, Done That","Maybe I am just naughty, but there is really nothing new here. I could have written a better book. On the other hand, it was nice to see that I know what I am doing without having to read it in a book. :) I guess if you have no passion and no animal instint, get the book."
3,Works well,"It seems to work as well as anything else while still being environmentally sound, but it is a bit more expensive."
5,Surprisingly Good,"Seventh Generation Dish Soap / B000E1G02WI was a little worried about switching over to this dish soap, but I took the plunge and I'm really glad that I did. I feel that the dishes get as clean as they did before, and my hands don't feel raw and painful after washing. I have really bad skin allergies, which is probably why chemical cleaners disagree with me so much, and I'm very happy with this natural cleaner.I originally purchased a single bottle from [...], but Amazon turns out to be a slightly lower price (adjusted for scale, of course), so I'll probably order the larger Amazon pack whenever I run out next time.~ Ana Mardoll"
4,The devil is in the delivery,"I got my box AFTER the ups website said that the shipment has been ""damaged"" and was being returned to Amazon. The bottles were sticky and soapy - clearly, some bottle had sprung a leak. But the oddest thing was that the box only had 11 bottles! I haven't contacted Amazon yet, but I hope they give me a refund for that bottle."
3,Dishwashing liquid is great - but beware of poor packaging,"We've been using seventh generation dish liquid for a long time now and love the product, especially the lavender scented one. However, this particular package has a problem - it is not robust enough to withstand the transit - we received the package with serious leakage of dish liquid all over the inside of the box."
3,One bottle broken,"I received my box today and one bottle's top broke off and leaked through the box. DHL left the box on my porch anyway. I fault DHL more than Amazon. The lavender fragrance is nice, I cannot really comment on the cleaning ability yet. If it's not satisfactory, I'll post an addendum for your review.FYI: Amazon came through by refunding for the one damaged bottle.I liked this product so much (but must still use Dawn for real greasy pans)that I use one bottle a month and stock up on all 7th Generations lavender products when there is a coupon special. Try the laundry products."
4,Memorable Performance,"This is a noteworthy addition to any collector's library. The singing is exemplary and production eye-popping.As far as Pavarotti's ignoring the indicated triple pianos at the end of ""Celeste Aida,"" what tenor, inicluding Caruso, hasn't made this a ""show piece"" singing full volume? It's now expected, and audiences feel cheated. So it's become a moot point (a la Adrian Edward's Amazon.com editorial).Margaret Price's is outstanding, while Simon Estes is powerful, singing pretty much at top volume throughout. The triumphal scene is spectacular, and tomb finale emotionally moving.This is a hard piece to photograph, and the camera work does well enough. All in all, a fine collector's item."
3,A non-expert opinion,"This review should only be read by people who are as shallow as I am. I bought this because I like the opera, and wanted to witness the grandeur and spectacle that is missing on audio recordings. Also, it was cheap and had good reviews. The singing is fabulous, but Price's face and body are not made for close-ups. She was about 40 when this was shot, and even though she was gorgeous in her younger years, she had not aged well, being about 100 pounds overweight. I know, I know, we aren't supposed to judge operas by the appearance of the singers, but for me, it is very distracting. Buy this performance on CD where you can use your imagination to create a young, beautiful Aida. Pavarotti shows his age, too."
3,A little story of an Ethiopian slave and the fortunes of war,"I have to confess I have not watched much of Verdi so I do not have enough knowledge to compare and contrast. I also was watching sub titles the firt time through. Looks like I will have to find a different production and hope it is just not Giuseppe Verdi I find band. I know this 1985 but it has a 60's feel.This presentation seems a bit bland. But Stefania Toczyska made a splendid Amneris and kept you in your seat wanting more.Do not let me discourage you from watching as everyone needs to know the story and especially find where they extracted the Act 2, Scene 2: ....Triumphal March from.""Aida"" an Arabic female name meaning ""visitor"""
2,"Verdi - Aida / Wanamaker, Price, Pavarotti, San Francisco Opera","I regret not ordering the La Scala version, which I have seen, for I found both the picture and sound quality of this one so poor that I may never watch it all the way through. A professional review I read, alas, only after buying it said that the poor quality probably reflected the relatively early date on which it was recorded."
3,Follows the formula,"Whether the subject is sports or college debate, the same formula is applied over and over again. TGD is an ok movie but very far from being original. Denzel Washington, as always, is awesome but its not enough to carry the movie. Yes, there are some good parts but, overall, TGD is contrived and predictable. I just keep thinking: ""Remember the Titians"" with speeches instead of a football.Not terrible but not recommended."
3,THE GREAT DEBATERS.....NOT THAT GREAT!,"I know there are a lot of people who loved this film and I did enjoy it, but it felt like something was missing. The cast is excellent as well as the subject matter, but many scenes have very uninspired dialogue. The film is also a bit long and that might not have mattered if the dialogue was better throughout. it's a good film worth seeing, but it's not as great as some reviewers would want you to believe."
2,snorefest,"I gave this two stars. One because I love Denzel, and one for the climax. This role did not tap into Denzel's awesome talent (see training day) Plus, the kid character was screechy and annoying. It didn't reveal how to become a great debater except for enunciation and knowing your facts. On the meat scale of spam-prime rib, this was a cafeteria hamburger."
5,The kids get down,The young stars in this movie are great actors they throw down great debates great story Mr Washington & Forrest shine as always but they let the kids have the spotlight and they run with it dam good movie
4,My Own Opinion,I thought the movie would have been more enjoyable if the parts of the teacher were not shown of him trying to start a union or if that was to be it should have been more apparent. I thoroughly enjoyed the teaching part of being a debater and I thought the actors were great!
5,Great Inspirational Movie,"I showed this movie in my class for a unit or Public Speaking. The students really enjoyed it and were prepared for thier speaking event after being inspired by the actors of this movie. I would recommend this movie to other Middle school and high school teachers. It is PG-13 and has a few uses of profanity, but it's nothing your students havnen't heard before."
5,Quality film,"Seen twice a few years ago. . . I am reminded of this film as I see it listed on my ""Review Your Purchases"" page on Amazon so, being unprepared to review it at this time, I'll just say for now that I loved it, that I enjoyed Denzel's performance (as always) and that it's an intelligent film with a well-treated sensitive but inspiring theme(s). Historical and informative too."
4,Unusual,An unusual subject matter well developed and well placed in the context of its time. Actors all excellent with special emphasis on Denzel Washington.
3,I Wanted It To Be Better,"When I came across this movie, I was excited! Denzel, Whitacre and a story about the first black debating team to go against Harvard- how could you go wrong? There were many good- even great- moments, but it wasn't as good as it could have been. The story was solid. The scenery TOTALLY set the mood. There were diverse characters played by good actors. The historical aspect of it was interesting, but it felt formulaic and preachy. And although I am not a debater, I am a logical thinker and many of the arguments didn't seem to be based on logic at all. As I said, I am not a debater, so I could have this wrong, but it seems that that is what it is all about- a contest of logic. You defeat propaganda, red herrings, emotional arguments, and fallacies with logic, right?Hint for Oprah the next time: Just let the story tell itself. Don't try to tell people what to think or create a feeling. If it's a solid story with a good cast, the magic will happen effortlessly."
4,A solid movie,"1. Since this is based on a true story, one already knows the outcome of the movie and although the acting is a bit overly dramatic and stereotypical at times, in the end it's a solid movie with an important theme / message etc..2. A worthwhile movie for the entire family."
2,Too much lag time,"A good movie, BUT the amazonprime instant video version was terrible. There was big gaps in the visual and audio playback that made it difficult, frustrating, and annoying to watch. I am sure a dvd version of this movie would be fabulous. I hope amazon does something to fix this GLITCH."
2,nothing special,"Although Denzel Washington directed this capably, with a good feel for pace and timing, the script is predictable and formulaic: it's really nothing more than another flick about a teacher making a difference in the lives of disadvantaged students, something we've seen a few too many times.The only divagation from the formula is that the students in this film actually want to learn."
1,Do Not Buy This DVD!!!,"It's not that this DVD is bad - it is fine. However, this DVD is included with the newer Globe Trekker - Australia (Double DVD). So get that instead, unless you want to buy the same DVD twice - like I did."
4,a surprising cd from a mainstream label,i bought this cd at the mall after i noticed a few of the names on it. i was suprised to see the likes of origin unknown and ed rush & optical. it's not the best jungle compalation out there but it is still good. i would recomend it to anyone just getting into drum&bass as a starter to here a few good names. over all the cd has some very good tracks. it is on a heavy rotation on my cd listening list. buy and enjoy
2,"Negative aspects overwhelm any ""relationship"" value","The other reviews express almost unadulterated ardor for this director/writer, Eric Schaeffer. (sp?) Perhaps all of his films show the misogynistic/sadistic qualities that make relationships interesting? I don't find this to be so in this film and like the other ""low"" reviewer, it simply seems morbid and perverse. Any human being with an ounce of self respect would have left this couple behind, whether because of sheer meanness through words or sexually. Most relationships have conflicts of a considerably more benign nature. Representing the extent of this couple's confusion, depression, numbness and sexual deviance enlightens no one and certainly does not restore one's faith in humanity of any stripe. Frankly, it is easier to equate this film with troop reports from Afghanistan than any human relationship. I would not recommend this film to anyone. Other positive reviews feel like friends of the creators ""stacking the deck."""
2,"After fall, Winter","Slow, fragmented, drifts and relies on sex scenes for pull. Story has potential and better actors could have made a difference. Save your bucks."
3,compelling!,"The film is surprisingly full of new twists. The filming is enticing as well as the location.The storyline is at times, weak and the plot has times where it drags. The film does offeran interesting look at relationships and kinky activities."
1,Short-sighted,"The Politics of Transgenderism is an interesting commentary on society today, but it falls incredibly short of meaningful, documented research.One-sided, biased work such as this serves to only further divide."
5,Correction of the review above,"I would like to apologize for the mistake made in the review above titled ""Another King Crimson Masterpiece"". The correct name of King Crimson's drummer is Bill Bruford, and not Robert."
2,Not enough music and too much noise !,"Just like ""Beat"", this cd starts strong with the first three tracks but they are followed by experimental sounds goin' nowhere. A big dissapointement. When I buy a cd, I want to hear music, if I want to hear noise, I put a microphone in the dishwasher !"
2,Least favorite of the 80s Crimso,"While ToaPP has a few good tracks (the instrumentals Nuages and LTiA3), as a whole it is crippled by a number of very weak numbers. Interestingly, it is those very tracks that reviewer JMcHenry seems to like, so as with all art, it boils down to a matter of taste.I also feel that this disc sounds the most dated of the line-up, reeking of that awful early-mid 80s synth-pop vibe.IMHO, Adrian Belew's pop talents were better served in his solo/Bears releases of the same period. To me, they feel out of place on this disc (more so than on the previous release BEAT) This is the only Crim CD I never bothered to purchace on CDand I haven't listened to my vinyl copy in many years."
3,Less than stellar,"This album was a disappointment for me, but my expectations were high. I've got King Crimson albums from the first one they released. This one has no teeth. There is no comparison between Red or Discipline and this album. Sleepless is a nice cut, but the rest is just not that interesting."
4,"A ""pop"" Krimson?","Some people at the time wrote strange (to me at least) reviews about this album, saying it was too pop and things of the sort. I'm a Crimson fan, so I'm a bit bias, but I really like this album. It has some serious abstract landscaping as well as song with a more ""pop"" oriented structure. I clear they were more worried about textures than virtuso playing in this album, but ""Larks Tongue In Aspic part III"" is in here, just to feed the old fans some classic Fripp crazy guitar ostinatos and all."
4,If only there had been two great sides,"Although both of the other entries in the Fripp/Belew/Bruford/Levin trilogy are arguably better, when I want to listen to King Crimson's best songwriting, I pull out this album. Certainly nowhere else on any King Crimson album are there four songs back-to-back with the strength of the first four on Three of a Perfect Pair. Nowhere does King Crimson mix meter and syncopation as well as in the title track, which slides between a sturdy 6 and a devilish 7 (if you want to get lost, listen to Bruford's kick and snare!). ""Sleepless,"" with its infectious Stick lead-in, was as close as the group came to a hit in the ""early MTV"" era. The songwriting style evidenced in the first four tunes carried over to Belew's work with The Bears, especially ""Model Man"" and ""Man with an Open Heart."" Great stuff.The rest of the album? Well, that's why Discipline and Beat are better."
4,good album,"i been a fan of king crimson since the early eighties,they dont get much airplay on the radio.its good to listen to this album"
4,It will grow on you,"The first few times that I heard this, I was rather disappointed, but it got better with age. It's complex."
4,Like two different bands,"I have a soft spot for the last album released by the 80s quartet. It starts out strong with the title track and then lapses with three nice but forgettable tunes. However, the rest of the CD shows Crimson doing some really weird, neat stuff. I particularly like the sinister ""Industry"" and the bizarre, lurching ""Dig Me"". I like it!"
1,The worst DVD jewel case on the market!,"Whatever you don't buy Scanavo cases. Their hub design is ridiculously bad. Unlike others where you just press the hub to pop out the DVD, the Scanavo hub does not move and is solid as rock. It will hold your DVDs in a death grip, making them nearly impossible to get out of the case, and makes damaging the disc upon removal many times more likely than normal cases. I wish companies would stop using Scanavo or the company would at least change their piss-poor, crappy design, but this idiocy continues to survive in a market place with many more superior alternatives.Just don't punish your customers or whoever else will be receving your DVDs, and buy some other company's jewel cases."
3,"Good, But Doesn't Compare To Discipline","It seems that when Robert Fripp puts together a Crimson line-up, that it only remains really viable creatively for it's initial studio offering; then what follows is either an attempt to re-make it's debut with lesser tunes, or an entire breakup. Beat isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, just a letdown after Discipline, one of the greatest and most inspiring progressive rock albums ever made. Beat seems almost too mainstream for a follow-up, especially the single ""Heartbeat"", which had MTV era (they did play the video)written all over it. I learned to appreciate more of this one as the years have passed, especially after seeing them perform some of this material on The Noise video release. ""Neal, Jack And Me"" is a great cut, as is ""Waiting Man"". The rest is not that memorable, and overall has none of Discipline's groundbreaking edge."
4,"This'll Get Your ""Heartbeat"" Going","This was the second release from the strongest lineup of King Crimson, a tight, focused album rather unlike their earlier prog-rock work in the late '60's and early '70's that featured Greg Lake as the vocalist. The four folks (Adrian Belew, Robert Fripp, Tony Levin and Bill Bruford) are OUTSTANDING musicians, with Levin perhaps the best bass player ever (he played quite a bit with Peter Gabriel also). From the opener ""Neal Jack And Me"" to the closer ""Requiem,"" it's a tight, propulsive tour de force. ""Heartbeat"" is a great tune, and the odd ""Neurotica"" showcases the slightly skewed nature of the band."
3,i can't feel that beat,"this is a second part from Crimson's eigthies new-waved influenced trilogy (""Discipline"",""Beat"",""3 of a perfect pair"").and it's the least impressing one.The best songs from here are the pop ones (""Heartbeat"",""Two hands"",""Neill and jack and me"",).it is funny because Fripp's band is famous for long epic suits and complex compositions and not for pop songs.the longer tracks and more Progresive-rock oriented (""Requiem"",""sartosi in tangiers"",""the howler"") are quite boring and are lacking originality that almost all of King Crimson tracks has.""Requiem"" sounds like a parody of groups mid-seventies noise experiments - without melody or any synchronicity.in general - if you love King Crimson's music you will surely love it too (or at least like it) but for everyone who don't know their music so good i recomend ""Discipline"" instead of this.it is much more catchier,interesting and intriguue than ""Beat"""
3,Thin on Ideas,"Really, there's only an EP's worth of stuff on here that's worthwhile, and even less that's as much as ""really good"". ""Heartbeat"" is a decent pop tune. ""Sartori In Tangier"", an instrumental featuring Fripp going wild over brilliant band playing, is the album's highlight.Much of the rest of the album is derivative, sounding a lot like the first album's material, or just plain bad wimpy attempts at pop."
1,You'll Listen Once And Put it Away,"I have Civil War, Chance to Cut and also this CD, The Rose Has Teeth or whatever.I spend a lot of time and money chasing down engaging new music but everything by Matmos leaves me cold. The title track of Rose is fairly cool but the CD coasts from there on. I've seen Matmos live a few times with So Percussion in New York and their whole cooler-than-thou-gay-San-Francisco-performance-artist jive is so tired.I like the new bands from LA's Smell club scene, like HEALTH."
1,gross,"I bought this with my only reference point being their work with bjork. That stuff is magical. This stuff is beyond pretentious. Unappealing sound clips, mismatched ideas and uncomfortable fashionista beats. Its not like this release is beyond me, I like a challenging listen. But this just sucks. I don't relate to it. All the snot-nosed attitude of IDM without the appealing soundscapes. Or the forethought."
4,Absorbing Reading!,"I very much enjoyed reading this book. The author treats his subject matter objectively and gives both sides of the issue. In doing so, he creates a vivid portrait of Christian fundamentalism and education in the late 20th century"
5,Roselli at his best,"No one, absolutely no one puts the romance and love in these songs as Jimmy Roselli does. When he sings about the ""Old Wedding Ring"", you can see the people involved. An outstanding album, and I heartily recommend it."
4,Not a bad encyclopedia.,"From natural to artifical mummies, from mummies in the movies to those used in advertisements. You get it all in this book. Some complain about to much fluff in the book, but what do you expect from an encyclopedia."
2,The author was obviously mummified prior to writing this,"For some obscure reason this book seems to focus more on mummy candy, mummy clothing, mummy perfume, mummy movies, mummy urban legends, and modern mummy fanatics rather than Predynastic Egyptian mummies, techniques of mummification, use of herbs and scented plants in mummies, Egyptian afterlife beliefs, Hindu, Inca, Messopotamian, prehistoric and other mummies, and countless other much more appropriate topics. This book has no insight whatsoever, it gives no maps or detailed information, the tone is pitiable, and, overall, this is a disaster. Encyclopedia of Mumies gets two stars from me only because it gives halfway-decent data on near-modern mummies."
5,New treatments + great sidemen+ of great material= It goes down very easy.,"From Chega De Saudade"" and the hard swinging ""Days of Wine and Roses"" to the beautiful flute ballad reminiscent of Wynton Kelly's playing on ""You're a Weaver of Dreams"" and the Coltranesque tenor sax and piano explorations on ""Softly as in a Morning Sunrise"", the music is brought to life in a dynamic manner.It goes down very easy.The moods created by improvisations on jazz standards combined with scripture are a joy."
3,It's a re-print,"This book is a re-print. The original was written under the name Susan Kyle. The storyline is passable but it's got too many sub-plots happening at the same time, which sorts of distracts the reader from the main plot."
5,Good read,I enjoyed reading this book on my new kindle. The characters were well done. I would like to finish the other relationships sometime.
2,Not sure whether to finish or not,"I bought this book at a used book store and it was bundled with another by the same author titled ""Before Dawn."" I had never heard of this author before but thought I'd give her a try. I'm only on page 94 and already there are two discrepancies in the book. When Nikki finds Kane on the beach she worries because she has no telephone. When they get inside she called her doctor friend on the telephone! Also, having already told Kane she sculpts and sells her work in galleries, the next day he asks her what she does for a living and she says she's a housekeeper. He seems disappointed. Hello, did he forget she said she was a sculptor? Did she forget she told him? Things like this really bother me in books. It's very careless. Maybe it's just me. I read all the previous reviews and no one else mentioned the discripancies. I'll give it a few more pages."
3,Ok book. But travel research needs to be done.,The plot was ok but Ms. Palmer nees to look at a map if she's never been to the area she is writitng about. They were going to take the jet from Charleston to Seabrook Island? Ummmm you can drive to the island itself in about 15-20 minutes from downtown Charleston. It would take you 30 minutes to get to an airport that would be completely out of the way.
2,not her best,I read Diana Palmer for a easy no brains love story this was not it. To many plots and relationships going on and not enough on the main couple. I give it 2 stars because its Diana Palmer.
4,Video Ecstasy,"Often when viewing a small budget independent film, you do not know what you are getting in to and it winds up being a pleasant surprise. This was clearly the case with All Saint's Day which I viewed in advance several months ago. And, just as I did not know what I was in for by watching this film, the characters did not know what they were getting in to as they hatched a plan for a ""simple"" heist. The misadventures that the group gets into as they attempt to execute their plan leaves the viewer in stitches and not knowing what lies ahead for them. There are many comedic overtones, and whether you are a fan of over-the-top slapstick, or refined, subtle humor, you WILL find something to your liking in this movie. If you have nothing to do, pop in All Saint's Day and you won't be disappointed, if you have something to do, cancel your plans and buy this video now!"
4,All Saints Day,"This was a fresh look at young,energetic and wholesome boys trying to find themselves in a stereotypical neighborhood environment. They try to take the easy way out instead of being real men and work hard for a living. It is both delightful and fulfilling. You almost feel kind of sympathetic towards these young wannabes. With a cute cast of main characters and unforgettable extras, this film was truly entertaining. I can't wait to see if there is a sequel."
5,Reservoir Dogs of The New Millenium !!!!,This is a fantastic movie ! ! ! Tommy La Sorsa has done a masterful job of depicting a local heist gone bad in Brooklyn !! Not since Saturday Night Fever have we been able to relive the true flavor of this urban city!! I loved it in the theaters and even more at home!! I am definitley looking foward to Mr. La Sorsa's next feature. You have got to see this if you are a fan of movies like Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction!! Truly a work done in the eyes of a young Quetinn Tarantino!!!!
5,See This Film !!!!,"All Saint's Day is an EXCELLENT film, it is very cleverly written with a great setting and cast. Tommy La Sorsa does an excellent job directing this film and I look foward to seeing more of his work very soon!!! Since I am from Brooklyn and in the entertainment industry, I can appreciate the dedication and hard work involved in bringing this wonderful film to life, and it is EXCELLENT !!! A must see for everyone"
3,Standard public domain horror titles,"I don't own this, but I just scoured the internet to see how many and which films are on this set, so I'm passing along the info. Looks like your typical selection of public domain horror films that are on dozens of cheapo collections already. Here's the list:White ZombieThe GorillaThe Human MonsterThe Devil BatChamber of HorrorsThe ApeInvisible GhostThe Ape ManScared to DeathThe Indestructible ManI Bury the LivingBucket of BloodThe Wasp WomanHorror HotelThe Devil's HandCarnival of SoulsDementia 13The Last Man on EarthKill, Baby, KillThe Devil's NightmareMoon of the WolfSilent Night, Bloody NightGood Against EvilSnowbeastNight Train to Terror"
2,The real thing missing,"This weekend I bought Gene Dunlap's previous album, Groove with You. On a few songs he uses drum programming and, hardly recognizable, occasionally percussion programming. Such a pity. His songs with the real thing are sparkling en refreshing. Luckily, ""Groove with you"" offers enough live performances on drums and percussion. Reading the review of Jonathan Widran about Gene's latest release, noticing that the album only contains machine created percussions, made me decide not to buy ""Tales of the Phatman"". Thank you Jonathan. You saved me from buying an album, I would surely regret.I really hope the Artist himself will read this review! The same goes for many other contemporary jazz artists. Try the latest relaeses of Everette Harp, Kirk Whalum, Jeff Lorber, The Rippingtons and many others. Please gentlemen, quit using computers and give us 'live' perfomances"
3,The Real Problem is...,"While Gene's last two albums cannot compare to what this marvelous drummer and composer had recorded earlier, the ""Real Problem"" is that Capitol Records has not re-issued the albums he recorded in the early 1980's on CD. I cannot understand this! ""It's Just The Way I Feel"" and ""Party In Me,"" are hot commodities on the web sites that sell vinyl. C'mon, Capitol, please give us what we want!!!"
5,German Classical Shred at it's Best!,"Bernd Steidl rocks like no other. Even Steve Morse (Deep Purple) exclaimed ""Fantastic!"" ""He is absolutely mad!"" If you love this CD high highly recommend that you purchase his first CD entitled "" Psycho Acoustic Overture"" which I like even a little better. I actually don't have the ""Paganiniana"" U.S. version CD. I have the German (european) version which is called ""Burnt Steel"" and has three extra tracks on it: Cobra, Odyssey and The Bunker. This CD has slightly more keyboard and techno-compostion sound on it than his previous CD does. That's why I prefer his first CD, it shows off more of his mastery shredding skills on the classical guitar."
5,ONE OF THE BEST GUITAR ALBUMS I EVER LISTENED TO,"To describe this album i must to use these three words:Beautifull, Impresive and Unforgettable. This is Steidl's second release since his great debut album ""Psycho acoustic overture"", that one was an amazing album... but this one is better. I must to say that this one is pretty diferent from the first one too.The comositions in this album are great...the songs where composes by steidl himself and other from great composers as paganini or albioni. ALL the songs in the album are really great and diferent from ech other...its hard to say wich ones are the best by my point of view...i must say.Impresive songs: paganinana 1 and 2beautifull songs: albioni addagio (it almost made me cry) but the other song are also great.If you are a guitar player, guitar music fan, classical music fan...or just a music entusiast looking to hear something new...DON'T MISS THIS ONE, IT'LL BE ONE OF YOUR FAVOURITE ALBUMS FOR THE REST OF YOUR DAYS."
4,Overall it works well,"First off let's just say that in Love Like Blood they have made an incredible song that any band would give their lives to make. Agreeably catchy, it has all the right ingredients for a killer pop song ( and no the pun was not intended ).As for the rest of the album......well it has it's bad moments. Tabazan and Kings and Queens have some slightly embarrassing lyrics plus Jaz Coleman's overwrought frightened-at-what-the-world-has-become vocals can be more than a little tiring, it still offers a great slab of 80s new wave pop music.Without a shadow of a doubt this is one of Killing Joke's more commercial albums if not THE most commercial. Granted there are Brighter Than a Thousand Suns and the panned Outside The Gate ( which I have not had the mis/fortune of hearing so I cannot judge ) but this is Killing Joke at a crossroads: not as heavy as they were before, not too wishy washy. A sort of combination that happily sits inbetween."
4,An excellent book on TPM,"Although the book has been intended to focus on the TPM for the process industries, yet I found the book equally valuable for discrete manufacturing. The book explains in detail the TPM pillars and can be used as a guidebook for direct implementation."
5,Details into a TPM program,This textbook provided detail into a TPM program. It is not a quick read but definitely worth the time if you are looking to implement. A TPM program on e shop floor.
4,TPM Reference Title,I think this is the reference book for TPM. It's not the easiest book to read but is comprehensive and detailed like no other book I've seen on the subject. A must have book for anyone interested in continuous improvement.
2,"Poorly Developed Characters, Thin Plot","If you buy this book expecting a corporate thriller, filled with larger-than-life characters and exciting tales of industrial espionage, you will be disappointed. TPM Manager is a tiresome main character---imagine a dumbed-down, cliche-filled John Galt from ""Atlas Shrugged."" Many times I shouted: Shut the F--- up! as I read TPM Manager spew drivel on the wonders of TPM. Initially, I wondered if Suzuki's book was purely ironic. Alas, the author really believes this nonsense. Here's some free advice: save the money, skip the reorg, don't hire the consultant, refrain from making people ""take ownership"" over a language that no one really takes seriously and instead show re-runs of the ""Love Boat"" once a week. It is guaranteed to make your employees run back to their cubicles and do some work."
2,Fischer Trash,This is an Amadeus 'straight to' movie. It is entertaining but pure trash. Some good acting and some really bad acting. It is wortha watch but nothing great. Pure exploitation and tabloid trash. They stretch and exploit the truth and even add some garbage fordramatic effect and shock value. This will end up a cult so bad it's good movie if that.
2,forgettable,Im a huge Fischer fan but I saw this a year ago and I dont even remember anything about it. It just wasnt that good.
1,"Bad and Ugly, with very little Good.",I agree completely with the first reviewer as far as The Bad and The Ugly go. But I wasn't as wild about the singing. I thought that Wotan and Fricka were sung admirably. Angela Denoke was OK as Sieglinde but she will never make you forget the greatest interpreters of this role. But I found no beauty in Siegmund or any of the Valkyries.There should be a law against any production that makes a travesty out of the magnificent farewell of Wotan to his daughter.
5,One Night in a Bad Inn,"One Night in a Bad Inn. I could not put the book down. Christy did a very good job of putting the story line together keeping ones interest through out the book, while keeping up with the back ground and story of Both families.Wonderful Job Christy"
3,Intriguing history but too long,I was glad to read some real good stories about life in Montana during the turn of the century through WWI. I thought too much of the book was devoted to the war maneuvers around WWI and was based on historical accounts and not first hand recounting from those who had been there. Great historical research about the times. Would recommend reading it for those interested in Montana history.
2,Juvenile writing style,"I was disappointed after getting into this book of the juvenile writing style. Seems a 5th grader could read this book easily. Short, simple sentences got very annoying and had to put the book down."
5,A Metal Masterpiece,"This album outshines most any metal album that I can think of. With it's ripping riffing (cute, eh?) and it's excellent vocals, lyrics and musicianship all around, it throws all other metal albums for a loop.Done in a ""classic"" metal style, very guitar heavy with no Synth, lots of guitar solos, etc. Silicon Messiah rips into you from the first to the last. The track ""Stare at the Sun"" is honestly one of the best metal tunes ever written. It's beyond discription. Check these guys out for yourself."
5,One of the Best albums of the 90's,"This C.D. is amazing and has the best guitar sound ive ever heard (no joke). The tones are incredible. The riffs are superb with a twin guitar attack. There is great variety as well with many acoustic/slow guitar starts etc...... If u like REAL Metal (ie. Judas Priest, Megadeth, Dio etc...) buy this album."
4,"gorgeous, sumptuous and original","This is not the Nutcracker ballet that everyone is familiar with; the story is more sinister and creepy. However, the sets and costumes are just amazing. They've created different dance concepts for act II instead of candy and flowers and their choices worked better for me -- for example ""Coffee"" is performed by a stunning caged peacock. I don't think I can really describe this ballet well. I don't think it is an ideal video for small children (Drosselmeyer is especially creepy), but I think the obliqueness (I can't think of a better word) of it is better suited to Tchaikovsky's complex score."
1,Polygram Video 1996 re-release of Paramount Pictures 1986 Nutcracker,"The original motion picture Nutcracker starring the Pacific Northwest Ballet under Kent Kent Stowell, directed by Carroll Ballard and with production designs by Maurice Sendak is a marvel to behold. Please see the original reviews for this screen production. However, since the film was released on VHS in 1987 it has not, to date, been introduced on DVD. This has presented an opportunity for companies such as Polygram to offer low quality VHS tape copies since the demand remains high for this screen rendition of the perennial favorite. No matter how enticing, I strongly recommend that potential buyers steer clear of these second generation tapes. They are invariably of poor video quality, recorded in Extended Play (EP) mode, and not worth the frequent high price charged by the sellers. Buyer Beware !"
2,Not for kids or educational use!,"I had hoped to use this in my (Spanish) classroom, to replace an old PBS Going Places VHS. However, it has several things in it that are inappropriate for school-aged children (I'd put it at about PG-13) and I certainly can't use it in a middle-school classroom! Scenes about ancient sex toys are pretty much unnecessary in any travel video; then to find that the exhibit was traveling and not even a permanent fixture in the town just made me more upset! I do love the adventurousness of this series; but sometimes things go a bit over the edge (there's an emphasis on drinking and partying, and some of the ways the two women sleep are simply unsafe for women traveling alone!) This is a very informative video for the average adult traveler. I simply can't use it in the classroom."
2,Not a typical Globe trekker!,"Although most of these videos are very fun, accurate, and educational to some extent, this Spain episode is not very good. The Northern section is fine and interesting but then in the Southern section there are strange sexual references on a few occasions making it impossible to show in a classroom. Having lived in Spain, it seems to overly stress stereotypes of what the people and places are like and doesn't do the culture justice."
2,inappropriate DVD for classroom use,This video has a short segment that is inappropriate for middle school and younger. I will not order Globe trekker for my classroom again. Some type of rating should've been on the box. Thank goodness I previewed the DVD. I'm not sure it is even appropriate for the high school Spanish classes.
4,Myofascial Pain text,"Product came on time and undamaged thanks to shrink wrap, although box was very mangled."
4,Great Collection...Super Arists...Missing One Thing,"All songs and arists on this album are legendary from Queen to the recent Spice Girls. There music has shaped the way for modern day acts. The only surpising thing is why megastar Michael Jackson wasn't included. Last time I checked he was among the most, if not the most popular artist in the world selling over 60 million copies world wide of ""Thriller"". 'Billie Jean' was also one of the most polished pop songs of the decades. Oh well, as long as your happy with Prince's spectacular '1999' to substitute."
4,Landmark Work,"There is a direct line of descent from Killing Joke to Steve Albini, Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson...even Metallica and Queens Of The Stone Age. The fact that so many bands and genres have reduced this sound into redundancy should not detract from this 1980 album that it epitomises the apocalyptic sound of 1980's so-called ""post-punk.""A dark, bleak sound. Harsh vocals. Tight rhythms and thudding drums. Tracks like ""The Wait,"" ""Requiem"" and ""Wardance"" have aged well, sounding better than most of the doom & gloom angst-schlock being passed off as heavy music today. A true underground classic."
5,Flawless post-punk,"Killing Joke is easily becoming one of my favorite bands of all time, mostly because of this phenomenal masterpiece. My enthusiasm towards KJ started with Requiem, which is still my favorite of the lot. It's probably the most catchy song but every track is memorable and flawless to say the least. This album is a fine blend of punk, industrial, quasi-metal and even a bit of pop. It was quite influential back then; can you say Metallica, Faith No More and Nirvana?!The musicianship is top notch. The songs are very atmospheric and creepy. The band is not technically amazing, but the music is intricately crafted nonetheless. Jaz Coleman's lyrics are wonderfully apocalyptic and paranoid, and that's coming from a person who usually ignores lyrics!Other top cuts from the album are: Complications, SO 36 and Tomorrow's World. This album really is a perfect entity. It has got it all! I also like looking at it's interesting cover while listening to the gloomy music. Enjoy!"
5,the first and the best,"Killing Joke's first album is also their best. top to bottom brilliant, powerful, intense, like nothing else that came out in 1980. Best songs are ""The Wait"", ""Complications"", ""Primitive"", ""Change"" and ""Bloodsport"". Absolutely essential for fans of post-punk, goth, new wave, metal and industrial. Note that Metallica covered ""The Wait"" on their Garage Days Revisited album (now available on Garage Inc)."
4,Good bag,Just got this bag. Workmanship seems good. Materials seem good. I am 6 ft 220lbs and a little overweight and the fit is perfect. Can't wait to try it out.
4,Good points,"While the author belabors many of the points in the book, I believe it was well-worth the read. The kindle price was excellent!"
5,Essential accessory for protecting your Canon,"After buying our elegantCanon PowerShot SD700, I wanted a way to protect it without having to carry it around in a camera case.This silicone cover is just ideal. It gives me a much better grip on the camera itself, and still lets me easily use ALL the buttons and controls on the Canon. I can stretch the case easily to access the battery and memory card.I love the extra security that the cover gives me. The protection is enough that I don't mind dropping the camera into the bottom of a bag or putting it into a drawer.After buying the SD700, this is the very next thing you need to get to provide a safe skin for your Canon."
4,One of Elwood's Best,"The second book in the Angelwalk series is rather different from the first. Observer, a fallen angel, is commanded by Satan to compile all the things that Satan has caused mankind to do, and to put a twist on it, so that Satan looks like the good guy. Observer is then told to write it all down, and this book will become the new Bible. You may think I have given the book's plot away. Hardly. There are many different stories within this book. I just gave you the centerpiece. I enjoyed this book thoroughly. If you enjoy spiritual warfare, this is for you."
3,A legendary band that deserves better,"So far, THE YARDBIRDS documentary on RHINO, gets my nod for video quality. This particular dvd, ""The Legend of"", although it has some clips that the other videos do not, is of poor quality, and some of the songs are edited.I saw them live with Jeff in 1965 in Chicago, one of my more memorable concerts.They did much to make us all aware of the great blues that was coming out of Chicago, and they had an energy about them, that no other British Band could come close to, at the time.Hopefully, someone will take the proper care of remastering these performances, and put out the definitive collection and documentary.Until then, the ones we have to pick from, will have to do.Rave On Keith! Rave on!"
1,MUDDY!,"Stay away from Edduie Jobson's alleged ""remasters"" of the three UK albums, ""UK,"" ""Danger Money"" and ""Night After Night."" All three sound horrible! They are muddy with all the high frequencies rolled off. Save your money and look for the Editions EG versions. They sound MUCH better."
5,The cause of my tinnutus.,"Can't say enough good things about this album. The best ELP? This is better. As strong as Genesis circa 1974-1976. I've blown out more stereo amplifier channels, shredded more woofers playing this album than anything else."
4,A fan by accident because my brother bought it.,"The copy I have is on Vinyl. Which makes this a special peice. The reason I say this is that if this album was a waste of time to have in your collection I would not go to the bother of having to dig this old 12"" peice of plastic just to listen to this timeless music. The music that is on this album could have easly become singles on the radio in the 80's and 90's. The music does not go way out there such as King Crimson did but also did not go comercial such as Asia. This is the kind of stuff that you could listen to in a group of friends having a few cocktails and having it provoke interesting conversation. Hope to a degree this reveiw means something to somebody."
5,A rock masterpiece,"Buy it without hesitation. Outstanding progressive keyboards , drumming and guitar from four of the best artist of the genre."
4,Great classical progressive rock,Forgot about this assembled 1970's rock stars until I hear it on the radio....ha to get it back (ha it on vinyl way back when)
4,Classic Fusion prog,"The praise lavished on this title is deserved. The problem I have here isn't the music, it's the cd. They recorded it from less than clean source material, and even at that, they did a poor job. I was disappointed that that cd couldn't surpass the original vinyl in terms of playback quality. I finally went out and bought a cleaner piece of vinyl and recorded it onto my computer, remixing and editing out the pops and hisses in the process. The EG label is hit and miss in this regard.Bottom line the music is great, and if you don't want to go thru the tedious process I described, the cd is the way to go. Enjoy."
4,Timeless Prog-Rock,"One of the most overlooked album of the early Progressive Rock world,this one raised the standard!"
4,Time for another rave review? See Danger Money for 5 stars.,"I love the roto-tom drum fills sync'd with the synth. Tight stuff! Low points include vocals (straining at times to hit notes) and bloated keyboard intros that loose interest after a few measures. Still, it's in my top 20 of prog rock albums. There are moments of brilliant inspiration here. If you're looking to build your prog collection, click ""buy"". If you want just one UK album, I'd go for Danger Money."
2,the sum doesn't equal the whole,"i don't know why, but supergroups (whether music, movies, sports) rarely work out. you'd think with big names and talents, that would be projected into something extremely successful, but for the most part, it doesn't. in my opinion, u.k. falls under this spell. great names, all playing in successful bands, but together, the magic isn't there. to me, this sounds very labored, and forced vocals. i disagree with previous reviewers claiming this is an important part of prog history. no it's not. maybe the bands jobson, holdsworth, wetton and bruford came out of, but not this group. two plays is all i've given this cd and that was enough for me."
2,A Strongest Debut,"What I say about this album? John Wetton excelent vocals, Allan Holdworst, a virtuoso guitar, and Bill Bruford of Yes.The review of I. C. GARZA ""nach"" say than it is not remastered, I don't yet buy this CD, have in mp3 version, but if this CD is really not remastered, this was a bad reissue. Maybe this album in the future receive a best tratament than this.I am waiting for this, and fans worldwide of U.K."
3,Three Stars For Nevermore!!!,"The SUPER GROUP UK never achieved the commercial success that many expected. They were basically a flop like the band Asia. At least Asia sold some albums. Although, the talent was there the songs on this set are basically filled with stupid themes and really lack anything lyrical. I was disappointed with all of them...except for Nevermore. I give this CD three stars for Nevermore!!! This is the best song on the CD and the reason why I bought it!"
2,y-UK!,"I agree, this album is boring. Reminds me of the 80's band ""ASIA"", only not nearly as good (didn't like them much, either). It might have recieved another star if the awful singing/unoriginal lyrics were edited out. As usual, Holdsworth's guitar playing is excellent (what little you hear of it), but even in combination with Jobson's appealing keyboards/synths and Bruford's solid beat, this CD sucks."
1,Ho hum - not anotha prog rock album,"I went into a frenzy over this album back in 197? when it came out - missed their concert and almost never got over it. Still love/listen to ELP, Crimson and YES. So after all these years I find UK available on CD and buy it immediatley. What a BORE - this is what gave PROG ROCK a bad name. Both Bruford AND Holdsworth have been into this same ""intellectual"" (?) rock/jazz b******t ever since. every time/key change becomes agonizingly painful and I found that I couldn't even listen to the whole thing one time all the way through- I will sell my copy to anyone who is interested - it is like brand new!"
5,My Favorite! Complete!,"A Masterpiece. This is the definitive conclusion of 70's prog-rock days. Excellent musicianship by them, 4 masters. Eddie Jobson(Keys,Violin) devoted himself, Allan Holdsworth(Gtr) showed his best playing;really melodic solos, John Wetton's excellent vocal harmony and thrilling Bass playing and Bill Bruford(Dr)'s intelligent and cool playing plus recording quality! Best musicians' best performance. Cold flame. A MUST!"
3,Had Early Issues,"The unit seemed like it would do everthing that I needed for a vaction or school show. One unit for MP3 or video watching on the plane, recording the kids at the beach or taking snap shots. I opened the box and the camcorder and camera functions did not work. All I had was a snowy screen for both. It was sent in for repair...let's see what happens."
2,Wait,"I asked for a digital camera for Xmas. My husband went to a electronic store (alone) and came back with this. It does everything he says. Camcorder. MP3 player, has games, records voices and takes pictures. Well it takes crappy pictures. The camcorder and the MP3 player were very nice. We ended up returning it and getting him an Ipod and myself the digital (low price) camera that I wanted in the first place. I would wait until this gadget has been upgraded a few times. Like the 3rd or 4th generation."
3,"very old ""Modern miniatures!""","This book as a good collection of anotated miniatures chess games (less then 25 moves games) But from Modern it as only is name, since the most recent games there are from something like 1950! there are plenty other miniatures books with an updated collection. Another downside at least for me, this book is in descriptive notation and I prefer Algebric.Other then that, the book is well design, the games where well chosen, there are some rare games in there and they are well sorted by the opening played, that can be good if you are interested in study some opening, you can see fast were people tend to go wrong!"
5,Excellent,"If you are intersted in persian/kurdish music, this CD is a must buy. Shahram Nazeri has one of the best voices in this category. His great voice and the continus Sufi theme in the songs, create a very special recording."
4,GA Tech hard hat,Bought this as a Christmas gift......it was a little lighter weight than i expected and i wondered if it was really safe to use on a job site. It arrived quickly and overall i was happy with it. thanks
2,somewhat witty dialogue at times,"This is admittedly a dog of a movie. All of the cast in it have proven themselves in other films, but this one misses the mark. The only thing that's remotely interesting is the ending, and it's not something that anyone would write home to mom about. There is a bit of clever dialogue in the movie as well, mostly coming from Courtney Love's character, but in general this is not really worth your time or money (though it DID have a plot and it DID follow the plot, which is more than can be said for about 90% of the Action movies out in the market today, which is ALSO why it got 2 stars instead of 1).I can't even think of a comparable film that would be better to recommend, as it's not really comparable to much... I'd just steer clear of this film unless you're an extremely huge Beat Generation fan, and even then, I'd be wary."
4,"Good, not the best, but good.","I have to admit I am huge Courtney Love fan. I have really enjoyed her in 200 cigarettes and The people vs Larry Flint where she proved to everyone that she can indeed act. I have to admit that I am not very familiar with the whole beat generation,but I have read the works of Burroughs, Ginsberg, and Keurorac. I didn't find out about this movie untill recently, andu assumed that Courntey as Mr. Burroughs wife, would be a minial role. To my suprise she is pretty much a central character of the movie. I feel that the movie had some wonderful cinematography, but the acting was a little bit low keyed for all those involved. Still for any enthusiasts of Courtney Love its a must. She played her part well and I am afraid that the subtly in her characters experession through out the film may have either been intentional or chalked up to poor directing. In any case the film is definitely worth a look."
3,Burroughs Fans Only,"This movie was obviously made for William Burroughs/Beatnik fans only! Slow moving with a lot of dialogue, although interesting to see a glimpse into everyday life of Burroughs/Ginsberg and others. A ""must see"" for fans; A ""hard to get through"" for non-fans."
4,Visually appealing.,"This film was much better than expected, great performances and a visual treat, wonderful light and color, and you can almost smell the lush, tropical foiliage of Mexico and Guatemala. I loved Courtney Love. She never had a bad scene and was gorgeous throughout, like a young Anna Magnani. It was fine seeing Kiefer in something so different than ""24"", and Ron Livingston played a very tight and appealing Allen Ginsberg. There is much to enjoy here. It is a fascinating glimpse into the time period and the lives of these turbulent souls. Take a trip to Mexico City and visit with the Burroughs. It'll make all your headaches disappear."
5,Delightful,"This movie is best enjoyed by Portuguese native speakers, as me. It touches the hearts of everyone who sprang from Lusitania. Beautiful."
3,Testamento - interesting look at Island life but,"The movie is well made but I found it just didn't get to me. Due of course to my own insensitivity, I just didn't care about the characters or their lives."
2,Beautiful scenery is where it ends,O Testamento is a beautifully shot movie that shows the amazing geography of Cabo Verde but that is the movie's only redeamig quality. The extremely sexist script is slow to the point of being almost painfull to watch at times. I recommend just getting a travel video for Cape Verde and skipping this disappointing attempt at Cape Verdean filmaking.
3,"A little entertaining, but director held back on central story","The love story between the two gals is simply not believable because there is nothing prior to their ""awakening"" that indicates either one of them was physically or emotionally attracted to the other. Was Nina a lesbian when she first appears on the screen? Was Lisa a lesbian coincidentally working in the restaurant? No clues given. The director (Parma) was ultimately timid about the subject and the first kiss between Nina and Lisa is delivered without spark and passion -- and if there's more to being a lesbian than just two women kissing, you won't find it with these characters. The story of two women destined to find an interest in each other beyond their attachment to the restaurant lacks evolution. Finally, the pseudo-Bollywood ending was not only out of place, but it made whatever came before it absurd."
4,A Fluffy Confection of a Film,"Nina's Heavenly Delights is a lighter-than-air, fun film about family, the meeting of cultures and the sensual pleasures of life - like food and sex. Er, I mean love. Between very cute young women.The story is dead easy to follow, the actors likeable and the aftertaste sweet. Both Shelley Conn as Nina, the daughter who has returned to Scotland after her father's death, and Laura Fraser as the local girl who captures her heart, are charming and cute.The plot, in which Nina decides to take up her late father's mission to win a local Indian restaurant competition, could be a little more challenging, but this isn't Oscar territory. What it is, is an angst-free lesbian love story that leaves you smiling - and maybe a little hungry for a samosa or two. I would serve a nice bottle of bubbly with this film."
4,"Good, but short","Provides a great look into the writing process, the recording process, the band, and just about any aspect of Diorama.Diorama, the album itself, is one of the greatest peices of music I've ever heard. The DVD really captures what the band put into it.My only problem with this DVD is it's too short. It would have been great to hear some alternate audio tracks, some rehearsal videos, music videos, some live material (it looks like they have some good stuff by looking at the credits). But otherwise, if you liked Diorama, I'd definately pick this up."
4,OK...,The graphics on this game are terrible!But I still think it is a fun game.It got boring after a while tho.This game is half good half bad.So get this game.
1,Don't waste your money!,"This has to be the worst game. If nothing else, it's totally boring. My little boy gets so frustrated trying to play it that he just turns it off. (me too!) We have never gotten past the ""flying off the cliff"" level. A total waste of money!"
3,A little frustrating but it's an alright game.,I bought this game because i thought it would be cute and it is. The game can be a little frustrating it's hard to believe they intended the game for children. i mean i am having a hard time with it. But overall it's a pretty good game.
3,game,game has a skip in it. Cannot play this game. Won't load up. Looks like it would be a fun game though.
1,This game is really boring.,I bought this game a few years ago and I liked it because I was only about 5.But now that I'm 11 now and I have not played this game for years I thought why not try this game since I forgot so much things about it.The game was really boring.I just got to level 4 and that was it.It was plain boring.And Filk never stops saying unreasonable commets.And also the graphics are horrible.Don't buy this game!!!
3,Good for Children,Some of the boards are a little confusing as the levels increase but my kids seem to enjoy it and can play for hours.
4,Acme Novelty Datebook,"I just finished reading this, and it's a real treat. Fans of Jimmy Corrigan or Acme Novelty Library will enjoy drafts of these but expect differences in style. This gives a better look at Chris Ware than his other publications that I've read. You can really feel his frustrations in this work. I reccommend this to both fans and non-fans."
5,great stuff,"beautiful drawings...no matter how self critical mr. ware was back in the day. the book really allows the reader into the head of a master illustrator. if you're looking more for a graphic novel, don't start with this one (try his first real freshman work jimmy c, or his ACME novelty library, probably my favorite - you get a real sense of what ware is all about - clean lines, insane, or better put, anal details). anyway, back to this one...great book, if you're a fan of ware, there's no reason not to get this one, and if you're not yet convinced, this is a nice piece just to have - these same drawings and doodles that once inspired ware himself, now get me thinking. love it."
2,La peor selección de Luis Angel/ The worst of Luis Angel,"Luis Angel es uno de mis cantantes favoritos, pero a menos que uno sea un fanático a muerte no recomiendo comprar este álbum. Fuera de Lluvia no hay temas conocidos. Algunos están más o menos para oir, nada impresionante conociendo la cantidad de éxitos que el cantante tiene. El sonido tampoco es muy bueno. Escribí esta crítica airado por esos que están tratando de vender este álbum por mas de $20 dólares en Amazon. Son unos pillos. Este álbum no vale la pena tenerlo.Luis Angel is one of my favorite singers, but unless you are an extreme fanatic I don't recommend to buy this album. Besides ""Lluvia"" there are not known hits. Some songs are ok to listen, but nothing impressive knowing all the hits that the singer has. The sound is not very good either. I wrote this review upset with those who try to sell this album for over $20 dollars. They are such thieves. This album is not worth having.Cheruk."
3,Tusk of Jaguar... hmmm... not quite toothless,"Akira Takasaki proves he can do more than shred on this collection. The songs run the gamut from prog rock to fusion and even some contemporary classical (sounds like a string quartet in the style of.. Penderecki, maybe?) While not groundbreaking or even amazing, there are enough surprises (odd meter, Jon Lord style organ, the aforementioned string interlude) to keep things from being samey. The vocal tracks are performed acceptably (to the standard of J-rock of the time).The only glaringly weak spot for me is ""Show Me Something Good"", which sounds like a slightly reworked version of Journey's ""Stone in Love"". A worthy addition for any fan of early Loudness (as in before ""Thunder in the East"")."
1,Waste of money,Its in no way comparable to a good memory foam pillow of the same cost range. ($45 to $60).This product is a waste of money. And there is no returns or refunds.
2,"Good idea, but does not work very well.","The interchangeable cores for the pillow are a good idea, but they do not work very well. The pillow material compresses, and you are left with no support (for the softest core) or a hard cylinder that does not support your neck very well (medium and hard cores). Also, the pillow opens to put the core in and does not close completely."
5,Less neck pain after using this,I use it every night. Takes about a month to get fully use to it. I didn't know these existed before. Recommended by our company physical therapist.
1,Uncomfortable!,"I bought this pillow hoping it would help me sleep & help my neck pain. Boy was I disappointed. My neck hurt worse after using this pillow & the material smells. I returned it, don't waste your money."
2,Pillow has fumes. Seller takes too long to mail things.,"The seller took over a week before they mailed it out. I was copied on a reminder email from Amazon and then they mailed it the next day. Anyway, it was too long so I won't order from them again.Secondly, the pillow has a lot of chemical-smelling fumes, which I am allergic to. So I'm going to have to air it out for several months.However, it works great for my neck - not too firm, not too soft."
2,Not for me,"Fast delivery! The idea for this pillow is great. However, the pillow is a little flimsy. The foam has a pre-cut slip in area where you place the firm pieces of foam. But the pillow as not sturdy enough for me to sleep on. I am going to use it in the car when I need a nap."
1,Terrible Quality!!,"I bought this pillow hoping that for $45, it would be a good investment as well as good for my neck. I couldn't have been more WRONG! This pillow is terribly cheap. I wish I could give it a worse review (doesn't deserve even one star!) I tried to take the pillow out of the pillow case to investigate the foam quality and I about ripped into the foam with my fingers just trying to get the case off. YUCK! This company should be ashamed of setting the price at $45. And the foam inserts are no better. Is this a joke?!?"
5,Double Core Pillow Orthopedic- Core Item #172,"I am pleased with this product and the quick service to deliver it.If i ever need another product like this i will buy from this company.Thank you,R.D.F."
5,The Lowest of the Low are back!,"I was lucky enough to get my hands on an advance copy of Sordid Fiction during the Low's gig at the Waterats in London UK on September 16th. Seeing the guys playing together again was fantastic, my only complaint is that it left me wanting more!Luckily for all of us, Sordid Fiction delivers what Lowest of the Low fans have been craving for years; an album full of terrific new songs, beautifully written and arranged.Do yourself a favour and pick up a copy!"
1,Not just the attitude,The attitude isn't the only thing that is bad here. The music and the cover picture are pretty awful as well. Avoid.
3,"Perishers' ""Let There be Morning""","The Perishers sound exactly like Travis. If I just heard it without knowing that it wasn't Travis, I would simply assume it was Travis. It's kind of weird. ""Trouble Sleeping"" is the best song, and the CD is pretty good. It's not original though, at all. If you like Travis you will like the Perishers."
1,Good book - if you like JDK 1.0.2,"Looks to be a fine reference on Java, but it's of little use if you're one to program in JDK 1.1 or later since it focuses on JDK 1.0.2. An updated version would be more appropriate."
5,"Love having it, ordering a second one now","I've never had to use it, but it's a small shape with a point at the end and it fits nicely in my pocket, about the size of a cigarette lighter or a lipstick. Its never gone off. I often go into the city at night and there are some areas that make me feel uncomfortable walking in at night, and I just hold on to it with my finger ready to go as I walk, I feel so much safer with it.I'm ordering a second one now for a trip I'm taking.In the past few years know of 2 people who were attacked walking around at night, and didn't have anything to defend themselves. Why wouldn't you want *something* to defend yourself and get away.Worth every penny."
2,Shipping costs are rediculous,"I like this product, but, I'm looking for a replacement.To order 2 units, the cheapest shipping is $15.00."
3,Casing too fragile,"I never had to use this (thank goodness) so I cannot say how effective it is. But I would like to say a word about the casing. Too fragile. I carried this on my keychain which hung from my belt loop. After about 2 months or so and all the abuse it went through from my daily activities, the casing came apart and broke. Everything else about it was good. The best part that I thought was great was the trigger button. It looks like it could be pushed easily, but it can't. Only if you slide it forward them push it will work making it a great safety trigger. Had it in my pocket several times and it did not shoot. I would recommened this only if the casing were stronger."
5,The best pepper spray!,"Knock on wood, I've never had to use this, but it is my favorite pepper spray canister I've ever had. It doesn't have an awkard case, like several of the other brands, and has a patented design where you cannot spray it, unless you are intentionally trying to do so. (It won't happen on accident) Its very slim, and almost attractive, unlike big bulky ones I've had in the past. Fits perfectly on my key ring. It really does make me feel safer. If I'm in a situtation where I feel uncomfortable, I just hold onto it, I don't have to worry about undoing a snap or anything. Highly recommend it!!"
2,Unreliable,"I like the design because it is easy to carry and easy to use. Unfortunately, that is not what matters. I run on back roads where every so often dogs like to chase. I was bitten once and swore it wouldn't happen again. This dog was part of a pack of three (I never see the owners despite all the barking). The next time they came after me I was ready. When they were about 4 feet away I sprayed but the cloud didn't make it to them. I sprayed again and I think the wind caught the cloud because one dog looked surprised. Apparently not surprised enough because they came after me again the next day with the same results. The next time they came after me I tried to spray them but the device didn't work. I got home, opened it up, canister worked, but the mechanism that makes the canister spray was broken. A cheap little plastic part. So, if you think you are safe carrying this thing, think again."
1,Globe Trekker Brazil is for idiots.,"The Globe Trekker DVD has the most annoying host ever imaginable. In addition to his 8th grade attitude he pronounces every Brazilian word incorrectly. Having spent several years of my life in Brazil, I found this DVD full of inconsistencies and errors."
1,This sucks!,"This video totally sucks. The host is one of the most obnoxious people I have ever had to tolerate. You learn a couple of things, but its not worth it having to sit thru his blaringly obnoxious personality.As a side note, he must be gay or something, because not only does he go to the transvestite carnival, but he also goes to some sort of transvestite after party. Still, even if you are gay, this is not the film to learn about brazil. All movies by this globe trekker company suck big time."
2,no thanks,"Poor representation of the sites there. The facts presented by narration and special feature are interesting, but i dont feel i learned much and didnt see enough scenery. This show is definetely for hobo traveleres on the cheap, very basic and rustic travel here, not much overall the normal seasoned traveler would want to see."
1,Embarassing...awful host!,"I am a traveler and Brazilian...How embarassed I felt after seeing this video portraying my country and people so poorly. Ian missed so many historical, beautiful and meaninful spots. Believe me!! There are a lot more to Brazil than parties, macumba, and poor people."
1,Mistakes and Wrong Info...,"Ian missed the best spots in Rio (Botanical Garden, Imperial Palace, Marina da Glória, Municipal Theather...) and also has a biased view on Brazil. How come someone come to a country and can't speak some of the local language? British attitud about the world? The few words his says in Portuguese are completly wrong. Terrible biased view of Rio and Brazil (Ian Brazil is Brazil not CUBA). The DVD is too old!!!! Was made in the early 90s and Brazil since then changed very much...Very disapointed as a Brazilian!!!!"
2,Very Educational....,"I don't think the real point of Black Hands, White Sails was to teach you about whalers. It was more or less another book about the struggle of blacks in America. There's only so much a person can read about whaling. I learned a lot while reading this book, and it had a lot of information in it. I reccommed for those insterested in the struggle of blacks or fans of whales. If you don't like either of these, try going to the library and reading a little first."
1,A Kid's review,"It's lacking the vary basics, like how many days are in a month and so....but if you like to play games about greek and norse mythology, and would like to know the islamic or jewish calendars, you will enjoy this software. I just wanted to learn the days, weeks and so on, but it doesn't teach about that."
4,Great Collection Of Old And New Freestyle!,Great CD with classic freestyle tracks (Time Passes By / Lissette Melendez) alongside new hits (I Need/Saint). Best Old School Track: Love Desire (Chrissy I-eece) Best New School Track : These Tears (Lovari)
5,if you love Freestyle music,"you must get this CD, it has alot of different drums soundsI love the following tracks, Geo Villacis, Fredd Lopez, Lissette Melendez, Chrissi I-eece, Javier Lopez. I can't wait for the next album to be release.....wow"
3,Old school flavor,"This cd is another one to add to your collection of freestyle music,even if there are some spanish songs in the cd. Joey Santana and Lissette Melendez are among the best on this cd. Joey Santana's old school style is one to listen too along with his vocals. I remember J.Santana formerly known as JoeyRedd and L.Melendez, they bring memories to keep forever."
4,works just like a mosquito coil!,"These seem to have the right ingredients to keep mosquitos away. They're reasonably long-lived, and come with a handy wire stand that seems stable enough. I bought these for a small area on my unscreened front porch to sit during the evenings. For that purpose they work fine. They are not wide-area repellents. They are quite solid, and not too easy to break off the burning end if you have one lit, and want to save the remainder."
1,EATEN ALIVE,"I was sitting on my friends back porch in Costa Rica having some beers and some laughs with one of these lit not 2 feet from me. I got DESTROYED by mosquitos. Cool idea, doesn't work."
1,Not worth the time or money ... much better is available.,"Of all the books I have ever owned this is probably the least worth reading. While Karen Finley is sometimes brilliant and incisive, this story is not. The sexual descriptions in the book are obscene, as are the pictures, without any discernible artistic purpose (particularly when you consider that this was originally a play). It might make you laugh, but only to avoid crying. When you're done reading, you'll wonder why you did. My advice is to choose something/anything else to spend an afternoon reading."
4,like listening to 40 minutes of great radio,"with all due respect to the privous reviewer, there is no such thing as 40 min of great radio.with that in mind. yo can't go wring with this CD"
2,Strictly for the under 10 crowd,"There is so little realism in the this movie - that it is strictly for young kids - like under 10. To begin with the star is supposed to be 13 - well, he is about the youngest looking and acting 13 I have ever seen. Also the idea that one can learn enough about skateboarding to win a rather large competition literally overnight, just because you believe in yourself, is quite a stretch. Any kid old enough to watch this movie knows better. The skateboarding and music are about the only good things in this movie."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"This movie took three years off of my life. It was like a horrific car crash that I could not look away from. First of all, Dom Deluise is the voice of a magical talking skateboard. The only way you'll ever see his butt on a skateboard. Second, this movie forgot to have stuff actually happen! Enjoy the montage of the skateboard kid and skateboard playing baseball together ( oh, yes) and then watching a sunset together. There are homeless people on the street, and people sick and dying, but the producers of this movie decided to use their money not on important causes, but instead on this waste of celluloid because they thought they were making citzen kane, or something. This movie hurt me, but I could never hurt it the way it hurt me. With all that said, I say go out and see it anyway. Trust me, you will rate all other movies with this one. And you too will say, ""Oh yeah, you think that movie's bad? You should see 'Skateboard Kid'!!!!"""
3,FYI for those giving these as gifts,"The Tool Band-It I purchased from Amazon came in nothing more than a plastic baggy - not the traditional sealed packaging that features an item name, description and photo. This is fine if you intend to purchase this for yourself, but if giving as a gift it may be a cause for concern."
2,Functional but shabby construction,"The tool band works as promised, but the velcro straps are very thin and the band itches like nothing else. The magnets may be strong enough to hold 25lbs but the velcro won't support any substantial weight. It was very cheap, but I'm not sure it was worth the cost."
3,arm band,Magnets are powerful - band not as big around as I thought - person I gave to as gift will need to use it around lower arm.
5,It's a keeper,"After reading some of the mixed reviews, pleasantly surprised when I received my Tool Band-It today and found it quite acceptable. I tried it on both my forearm and above my elbow. No problem attaching a small collection of wrenches, files, and screwdrivers to see how much it would hold. Might add some foam padding to the inside as some have mentioned that it can be uncomfortable when used on bare skin. Overall a nice inexpensive addition to my toolbox."
4,Good. Strong magnets.,"Bought it based on reviews. Yes, the magents are strong enough to actually hold stuff (reviews of competing products complained about weak magnets). Works on forearm. Works on biceps unless you're big (maybe 200#)."
4,Tool Band-It,"I bought the Tool Band-It for my boyfriend, a.k.a. my personal handyman, because he is always holding screws and nails in his mouth when he works on my house, and is always having to go up and down the ladder to get tools and stuff. This is a great way to hold those items and he really loves using it.The only negative we came up with was the size. It does not go as big as one would hope, especially if you're on the husky (or muscular) side. All in all though, this was a great buy and I would definitely recommend it."
2,Poor Quality Arm Band,"Defiantly was very disappointed to find out I did not get what I expected. I already owned one arm band that works great and is made out of some heavy duty material and can hold a hammer without question! As I went on amazon to order one for my other arm because I could no longer locate it in stores anymore, I opened my package to only find with surprise an arm band made of cheap pleather that can't hold anything heavier than a nail or screw!!"
5,Bought it as Christmas gift for Dad - He LOVES it!,"I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my Dad, and he had to open it as soon as he unwrapped it. He took it out of the package and began experimenting with it. He stuck just about every metal item he could find and the arm band held them all. It holds the items very securely. He was very happy with it, and could wait to use it at work and for home projects."
1,Uncomfortable & Doesn't work.,I work in short sleeves and the velcro straps are very narrow and hurt. The arm band slides up and down your arm as it doesn't stay in one place. You'd have to tighten like a tourniquet to get it to stay in place. My magnets were fine but the fake leather is extremely uncomfortable.
4,Handy Tool,"Purchsed for Dad and his house hold products. Strong magenet, not to heavy and easy acess to smaller metal tools, nails and screws."
5,Great product!,I saw this product and had to get it for my dad. He is a handyman and this is perfect for him. The product works exactly as you would hope and is very reasonably priced. The magnets are STRONG and the arm band tough. I am VERY PLEASED and so is my father. Thanks Amazon for always having fabulous products!!
4,Good,I bought this product for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it. The product came really fast in the mail but unfortunately it was kinda banged up but It didn't affect the product whatsoever so for the price I paid I wasn't concerned.
2,Weal Magnets,"I like the idea. The arm band feels well made, and the adjustable Velcro straps are great.Unfortunately this idea fails in it's most crucial element. The magnets are too weak. If you move quickly, anything attacked WILL dislodge, fall of, or at least shift a lot.I nailed mine t a wall instead.. It's great for sticking a small nut/bolt on it, but that's about it."
3,"Nice Book, Will Re-Read, But...","I did enjoy this book by Kara Oh and plan to re-read it in the future, as it is a good read; however, personally, I did not 'learn' very much from it all. Perhaps, its because I have read many articles and books on relationships for many years now. I was hoping to gain a lot of clarity and insight from her book after all the information I had seen on it, but was disappointed that I did not learn anything new.I do find this book to have very useful reminders of the differences in men and women and how we as women can better relate to men. Also, I found that a lot of the book referred to married couples and did not really seem to delve into single people like me, who at this time are uncommitted and out in the dating scene."
4,"This book should be called ""Starting a Relationship Right""","I bought and read ""Men Made Easy"" just as my divorce was going through and shortly before I began a new relationship. Kara Oh gives you practical advice on how to communicate with a man and understand what they are trying to communicate with you. Just knowing that men view sex as affection and a way of showing love helped me understand why they always seem preoccupied with it. I believe my ""new"" relationship had a much stronger start because of Kara Oh's book."
2,Some useful ideas but mostly all well known information,"This book was a helpful reminder of what I had read in other books. I found the writing slow moving and by the time I got to the so called ""secrets"" I found them predictable. There are a few good points in this book but not enough to fill a whole book. It did not have the depth that I was looking for."
5,Interesting and valuable,"I bought this book as an E-Book. I found it to be interesting, entertaining and valuable. Yes, the book is written in a fairy tale format, but that is part of its charm. Included in the book are ""secrets"" to which a few reviews have responded something to the effect that ""everybody knows that."" But the truth is that not everybody knows that. Kara explains in very simple terms what a man wants and needs in his relationship with a woman. Included at the end of the book are twelve secrets for men to help them relate to the woman in his life. Kara wrote me a note telling me that in her seminars she can tell the women that will walk out or give extremely negative reviews. We know them too, they're the man haters that write such columns as appear in the New York Times running down anything male."
4,Bought and given to friends many times,"This is my first review, but I must say I have paid for this hard copy book many times over and always end up giving it to a friend. It is excellent and eye opening."
4,Worthwhile Relationship Pointers,"This book reminded me of Venus and Mars in a good way. Whenever I see agreement from one author to the next, it instills confidence that the writer is on the right track.Ms. Oh provides pointers on how to appeal to the man in your beau. When you know how to push the right buttons, your man will be more gratified and eager to please, and you will reap the benefits of working with the male-female contrasts instead of against them.I believe this author knows of what she speaks. I have picked up additional pointers from her e-mail newsletters. Mastering the concepts in this book would be worth any woman's while."
4,The Art of Simplicity:Living Life by the Essentials of the Heart,"A Great little book to live your life by, this book will help you open your eyes to see and feel what was there all along. A book you can read over and over."
2,Deep Powder Snow,"I can't believe I had to pay $48.00 for a tiny little paperback which is clearly marked $6.95! Really?! This is a gift for my husband, whom I am sure will love it, but the cost of this little thing is absolutely ridiculous."
4,fun and easy to assemble.,"This item was easy to assemble and the kids really enjoy it. It is also lightweight and easy to move from one location to another. This will be useful in the summer for grass cutting. However, it does not have any anchoring system. Since it is so lightweight, I would feel better if I could somehow anchor it to the ground. still, my 2 and 5 year old love it."
3,Bolts don't fit....,"Well, it looks fun and also reminds me of my childhood toy I had in the 70's Only mine had 4 seats! Loads of fun for the neighborhood friends. I expect this 2 seater to be just as much fun, but I am disappointed that I have to run out to my local hardware store to get bolts that fitand give it the stability it needs. Safety first!Please make sure yours fit if you buy it. I found out when I started putting it together that the mm of bolts were not the same from the list of hardware to the step by step directions.I will update AFTER I finish assembling."
4,Would have liked it to go higher off the ground,"I bought this for my 7 and 3 year old thinking it would be like a see saw. It does go up and down as well as all around. It is also very sturdy and I put it together by myself in under 1/2 an hour. However, it doesn't go very high off the ground at all. They do still have fun, but it would be better if it were more like an actual see saw. For the price, I would probably spend extra to get something more see sawish...lol."
4,Good for the price,"This teeter totter is good for the little ones. My 4 and 2 year old children enjoy it for a few minutes then move on to something else. The posts on the bottom of the seats stop it from going down too far, which I am sure is for safety, but it limits the toy's full range of motion. It's a good value but I'm sure my kids will grow out of it quickly."
2,music didn't work-baby didn't play with it,"I bought this for my 11 month old son with hopes he would like it so i could get ""some"" shopping done with him in his stroller, but that didn't happen. When i got this the music didn't work it was warped but being a new mom i didn't even want to deal with sending it back. The only good thing was that it had a little snack tray for cherrios witch worked good...."
3,strange guys...,"This is indeed an odd album...I may even say I like it for some reason. Maybe it's because, even at this stage, Simple Minds had a natural talent for catchy melodies, maybe it's because the murky, thin sound goes naturally with the opaque nature of the lyrics. But there are blasts of distorted guitar here and there, Jim Kerr barely sounds like Jim Kerr at the beginning of ""Naked Eye"" (more like Johnny Lydon), and the angular, rather harsh sound of the whole thing lends a rather industrial flavor to this whole affair(they even have a sound collage of factory sounds). The whole thing is unique and uncompromising. How fitting it is that the cover has no artwork at all-just dark, dark blue. Anyway, for those who like the clean, friendly rock we heard in the back 15 years from this band would be fairly shocked by this album. I wonder what these songs sound like live, these days."
4,Kinda fun in a weird way,"I call this ""Robot Rock"". Ghostly, distant vocals, opaque lyrics, jerky beats and clammering guitars occasionally give way to eerie instrumentals that bring to mind music from ""The Twilight Zone"". There are real songs, though, and some of them are actually good-favorites are the pulsing ""Premonition"", the instrumental ""Film Theme"" and the pretty closer ""Scar""."
2,Dissapointing Kim Wilson,"I'm afraid I disagree with the raving reviews above. Kim Wilson is an exceptional harmonica player and a good soulful singer, but this live album just doesn't cut it. It's a fine album per se, but certainly not on par with Kim's talent. After a few listenings, I found myself bored by the repetitiveness and the lack of originality in arrangements.Blues, especially blues covers, can be tricky : on most songs of this album, Kim ends up sounding just like the other 399 covers of the same song. It's a shame because he's capable of so much better. I cound't help myself thinking this was just another live blues album..."
2,Don't Bother!,"The only reason I gave this book the 2nd star is because of the photos. Many details left out, Materials list doesn't correspond to detail specifics. Many inaccurate dimensions. Assembly instructions leave a lot to be desired. All this applies to what is supposedly the easiest model to construct.Add this to the differences between the actual car and the model design and you'll quickly realized you've wasted your money"
3,Building Antique Model Cars,"While this book shows wonderful plans most of us don't have a lathe or the metal to complete as shown,"
3,review,detailed plans but the title is misleading as all plans involve the use of brass as well as wood which needs to be turned shaped etc
3,Missing a lot,"I love this movie and the music, so this album disappoints me in that it omits the majority of Moroder's fine score. There are mostly vocals, some of which are ok, but the meat of the music score is totally absent. The scenes where Tony meets his mother and Gina, the scene towards the end where Sosa's goons are raiding Tony's estate, the scene where we zoom into Sosa's estate in Colombia, the final confrontation between Tony and Gina and the list goes on. Talk to me when these cues are restored and given their just position on CD."
4,A Little more of the score please,"While the coked up sound to the dance tracks are important to the movie, too little emphasis is on Giorgio Moroder's score. Like the opening credit music, or when tony's place is being attacked, the interlude the first time tony goes to South America to see Sosa. Not to mention Gina & Elvira's theme could be expanded or seperated. Gina's theme when tony finally see's her again & Elvira's theme when she just learns that frank is dead and also when we first see her. Tony's theme is good but too short. How about a Score Soundtrack as a companion to this one, and forget the Def Jam crap...(what a disgrace,Mr. Scarface)This is all they gave us, and it's too hard to get. Great music for a classic film. SCARFACE:The World Is Yours...also recommend:Heat SoundtrackCaddyshack SoundtrackBuster SoundtrackPeter Gabriel: Passion (Music for The Last Temptation Of Christ)"
3,"Doesn't skimps on songs, but not quite a 'soundtrack'","All the original songs heard in the film are here in all their glory. BUT, it's a 3-star review from me for the simple reason in that it omits some very beautiful Giorgio Moroder soundtrack cues in the film! Should be renamed 'Songs from the Original Soundtrack'! What happened to the opening heart-pounding version of 'Tony's Theme' (the soundtrack version is a slow -- but great -- burner), the Bolivian introduction Incan flute piece, Lopez' assassination, the attack on the Montana compound, and even a the groovy salsa jam heard in Omar Suarez' car introduction scene?I've owned this soundtrack for years, and do feel it's authentic, but incomplete nonetheless. Bonus Track for a future, more comprehensive disc -- although I'd never expect it -- would be to include Santana's 'Guajira' which Manolo is singing on screen as he walks to the mismatched 'Vamos A Bailar.'"
4,GIFT,this was a gift for my son who had been looking for it for quite some time and he was very happy to get it thanks
1,Total Junk,"After owning the original vinyl since 1984, I was excited to see this soundtrack released to CD. After buying it, I thought it was the worst piece of junk that Universal can ever sell, and I'm returning it quick smart for a full refund.I think it's an absolute sacrament, how they have destroyed Debbie Harry's ""Rush Rush"". Who was the mindless numbscull responsible for this?"
1,Buy Grand Theft Auto 3,"This CD is not worth it on its own. If you want to hear these songs buy Grand Theft Auto III and listen to it as you carjack people and run them down. Seriously, that ""she's on fire"" song is just bad. Really bad!"
3,Croc Files,"""Croc Files"" is a wonderfully entertaining show that both adults and older children will enjoy - some younger ones might be a bit scared by some of the close calls between Steve and the animals."
3,"too much entertainment, too little education","This DVD is a lot of fun. There is no doubt about that. After watching this, my four year old and his friends were practicing Steve's croc catching techniques on each other.But Steve himself and his wife are given too much camera time. And when the camera is on them, they don't seem to be saying all that much of value. Steve just gets super excited and tells us what a ""naughty crocodile"" he had caught.If your kids like seeing crocs in action, they might do better watching a documentary. At least they would see more of the crocs."
3,Eh,"The book was eh. Some of the pics were really good, but all the info was outdated. One of the best bands of the 90's deserves something better."
4,Pretty Good,"Based on my high expectations for this book it achived them to a certain point. The events were factual, but the writing stunk. Average Book!"
5,Insightful and Authoratative,"Taken as a piece of historical literature, 10,000 Miles has few equals. Mine is a first edition printing of the book,and it holding it in my hand often gives me a chill as I read Stuck's accounts of his winter travels by dogsled. Being a fan of the Alaskan literary genre, I hold this book in high esteem; in its own right, as illustrative and authoratative in its telling as John McPhee's Coming into the Country would be over 60 years later.Find it and read it!"
4,Good book,"This book has been a lot of help for me. I came from an all C# programming background and took a job as a VB.NET programmer. With what I already knew, and this book as a reference I was programming VB.NET almost as well as I had programmed C# the very first day.This book is a very handy tool for anyone to have especially for the price. My one compliant is that there is no index but you can quickly get use to thumbing though to find what you need in a hurry."
3,Good but out of date,This book really hit home the differences between C# and VB.NET. I am a C# programmer who is now working in VB.NET and even with the book being for VB.NET 1.1 I was able to get a better feel for the differences. I still find I have to look some things up but I have a better understanding of the underlying philosophy of VB.
4,Fun for My Son,"I teach second grade and am always on the lookout for books that could interest my 6-year-old son, a reluctant reader. I am happy to report that this book fit the bill! I read the entire book to my son in less than one day, and the light-hearted text stimulated conversations about time, numbers, and dinosaur theories and habits. While the story is simplistic, it is engaging as well, and leads into many future series possibilities. If there are more, my son is already set to read them, and I'll be giving them out to children in my classroom as well."
1,CANNOT BE INSTALLED PER MFG SPECS,"I am a ret. mechanic of 30 years and have learned that if you want something to last you should follow the mfg recomendations. This product cannot be installed as shipped,(not talking about added heater hose) on my 86 GMC 350. The instructions clearly state to not add more than 12-18"" of heater hose for lower block install. Easiest install is heater hose to lower rad. hose but they do not include the lower rad. hose coupler ""T"".The schematic looks like it was drawn by a third grader! The thing is not motor driven but works on fluid convection and has to be installed in a vertical position only. Had I knowen this I would not have purchased it. They do not point this out on the amazon website. It has been my experience in the past that products such as this,(slipshod instructions) probably are not worth installing because they just do not LAST. In short if they are going to economize on the instructions what else have they economized on?"
1,RED MOUNTING BRACKET MISSING- NEED!,"Looks like a good, solid unit, but the plastic wasn't sealed and the red mounting bracket is gone. I'm hoping someone there reads this and sends me one quickly. Also, that they let me know promptly that the bracket is enroute. Thanks."
4,Ok,"More videos should have been displayed, more of a self dedication type dvd, instead of a straight video dvd."
4,Great Video Collection,I really liked this video complation from Kellz. My only complaint is missing video for great Feelin' On Ya Booty. I really cannot understand how they left it out. Apart from that behind the scenes and short documentary on Kellz makes this a worthy addition to your DVD collection
5,dug the Videos,while I was Hit&alot of Miss with the Album on a Whole this Video put things back into perspective.I enjoyed this Set&It's Presentation.
4,Strung out on strings,"I bought these strings for use on my son's Yamaha electric guitar. He tends to break the high E string a lot, and rather than buy full sets and end up with numerous extras of the other five guitar strings, I find it more efficient to buy the high E strings in bulk.D'Addario is a high quality string and these are a great value. If you are a guitar novice and are looking for a particular string in bulk, just keep in mind you are probably not going to find ""bulk E strings"", ""bulk G strings"", etc. Rather you will find them sold by gauge. For example, for the high E string you would buy 09 or 010 gauge strings, and so on.I did not rate these strings a 5 for one reason. I have found they do tend to break more frequently that Ernie Ball strings, thus I would consider that brand a somewhat better purchase."
5,How is it possible...,"that this tour was within two years of the ""Prenda Minha"" tour, another available DVD? The arrangements, the color of these two DVDs couldn't be more different. It is as though there are two different Caetano Velosos and both artists drop my jaw in awe and consistently inspire me while they leave me dreamy. I have the CD and DVD of both. My wife and I saw maestro Veloso on this particular tour and we wanted to make the concert memories more permanent by purchasing the DVD.Caetano Veloso has no English-speaking equal. He is a poet, master crafts-musician and ultimate performer all at once. I know of no greater musician-writer alive."
3,Not the best from Caetano,"The kind of music included in this concert its not the best from Caetano Veloso,"
5,Best book ever,"There are a lot of ""Grandma"" books out there but not nearly so many for Grandpas. This book is an excellent way for Grandpa to share special time with their grandchildren."
5,"Fever does it again,it is slammin!","Fever is one or if the best Freestyle labels out there.You can see that they put alot of energy in making sure people get educated with freestyle.The cover and information is beautiful.THe songs are excellent.Unlike Metropilatans Ladies of Freestyle1,2, and 3 comps which seemed to be rushed out in the market,and have many artists who are not Divas and are hardly known.Fever definitly has all the divas Lisette Melendez,Safire,Nayobe dare i say anymore.Other Freestyle labels should look at Fevers releases because this is how your supposed to put out a cd.This is speaking from a true Freestyle fan since freestyle began."
4,A Romance Junkie,"Stefano is the kind of man we all need, he's rich, handsome, and madly in love with Fallon. It didn't matter to him that she'd been in an accident and had some scars on her beautiful face. He fell in love before the accident and it just didn't matter to him. I thought the ending was the MOST romantic ending Ms Marton has written so far. I read it twice....aaahhhh! I recommend this book highly."
2,5 Stars and More,"Simply put, this book was lovely, tender and touched my heart. Others have reviewed it on this site so there's not too much more to say. However,I wept and was truly moved. Fallon's story was extremely moving and Sandra Marton has outdone herself. This series is wonderful and I highly recommend it."
4,Pumping powerhouse rock and roll,"This record has found it's way into a permanent slot in my CD player, with it's raw energy and vintage vibe. Imagine the Cavern Club era Beatles transplanted smack in the middle of a hot and sweaty Memphis roadhouse, and you get an idea of where The Forty Fives are coming from. Other sounds come to mind also, such as the MC5, The Pretty Things, and even the early Who and Kinks. Pedal to the floor and damn the torpedoes, The Forty Fives are a joyride for the ears."
3,Great name for a garage rock band...,Great name for a garage rock band. Nothing ground breaking from this Atlanta band but they're decent garage rock and the singer has a strong angry voice with good energy. The Forty Fives would be a good opening band for Jet.
1,one album that didn't get it together,This album is full of short unfulfilling sounds that range from the monotonous to the unbearable. Lyrics that scream Jr. high and music that doesn't even muster up some toe tapping. I purchased this album on the advice of a friend who said that they rocked but was sadly disappointed with it. The production of it was lacking in any depth with no apparent style that was consistent throughout. in short they didn't get it together.
1,What??????,"I honestly don't remember ever hearing such a homogenized album. Every song except for one has pretty much the same feel, and I just couldn't get anything out of that one song anyway. Even when rock 'n' roll is simple and fun, there's at least a modicum of honest emotion in there somewhere. Not here (at least as far as I can tell). I had a bandmate who just loved this album, though it might have been out of obligation- he said it was what rock 'n' roll was ""supposed"" to be. Since when was rock 'n' roll about doing what you're supposed to do?"
3,45's (out of a hundred),"I bought this record with no knowledge of the 45's what-so-ever. Cover looked cool, song titles like what I thought to be the Doors informed ""Drinking with # 3"", and a fairly glowing reveiw sticker allowed me to plunk down ... for this album. So what do you get? Well, nearly every song speeds at a fairly rockin' but not swinging, pace, lyrics are standard "" she's no good. gotta get outta this place"" fare, drumming is fast but non descript, instrumentation unremarkable. The singer aint bad, but sings nearly every song in the same sort or urgent style. A 45 out of 100. You may get in the mood for this every once in a while, but don't spend ... bucks on it."
1,The worst album I have found at a used shop,"Awful, has nothing to offer the musical world whatsoever avoid avoid avoid. nothing of substance and nothing of value"
2,Get rid of both hosts & replace them with professionals and this would be SOOO much better.,"Since we have a daughter who was born in China I thought this would be an excellent dvd to show her birth country. Like the other reviewers I liked most of the dvd, but I couldn't get past the 2 annoying hosts. Both really should not have done this video, to me in my eyes they where your typical tourist making fun of food that is normal food for people in China and is different to those of us who don't live in China as well as other little annoying things. I just couldn't get past the hosts... maybe you can.This dvd features Southwest part of China including provinces of Yunnan, Sichuan & Guizhou and Guangxi and then the central part of China - Shanghai, Yangzi River, Xi'an and the Yellow Mountains. It also includes a Long Horn Miao Ceremony, Huangguoshu Waterfall, Giant Panda, a silk factory and the terracotta warriors."
5,Wheelbarrow handle,I bought this for a friend. He seemed pleased with the product. He used them to replace his old wheelbarrow handles.
2,"Good idea, Poor Product","The whole idea of having worms in 3D forts, sounds like it would be fun but the actual gameplay was lacking. There are problems with the physics of the game that make many of the weapons very difficult to use. The graphics do look pretty nice, and are one of the pros in the game. The multiplayer games do lack the quickness and speed of the old 2D worms games that made them enjoyable and ideal for a fast pickup game. The controls and the aiming for many of the weapons are hard to get the hang of, so it requires a lot of time just getting a knack of your weapons, before you can become even mildly proficient with them. Overall, this game is a disappointment to the worms series, and I would not recommend purchasing it."
3,An old one but a good one.,"This is a good family game that the whole family can play. It is strategic, so you have to think about your next move. You can't find it in the stores very often, but Amazon had it & it shipped right away."
1,Stay away from this garbage,"Just bought it today and after about 2 hours of play, the grip is starting to tear. STAY AWAY is the best advice I can give."
5,The Greatest Live Album Ever Recorded,Elvis is the greatest singer ever and this is his best. The live versions are overall better than the studio versions. His band is great and with the addition of the horn section it is better. The highlight is the 7 and a half minute version of Suspicious Minds.
5,Return to Form,"This is Pearl Jam's best studio effort since Yield, and definitely worth a look for past and present fans of this classic band."
5,Pearl Jam's Greatness,"As a band that has been around enough time to be praised and trashed throughout their career by media and so called music experts, Pearl Jam is still able to prove that they are the ones to set the trend mark in rock.This album is the living proof of PJ's maturity and their knowledge (that only time can give) of what rock music should sound like.Intensity, crazy guitar riffs, monster drum playing and Eddie's vocals switching off the pace at the right moment of each song. Lyrics fall down a little, but it's like if they know now that music is the message, not so much the words.Using every trick on the book, PJ has pulled off the record that could and probably will put them back on the top.Only thing lacking here...a Black or Immortality kind of ballad to put the melancholy vibe.In sum, buy this, enjoy it and forget everything you thought you knew about this Seattle's band."
4,Finally,These guys finally put together a bunch of good songs. I think this is their best effort since Vs.
3,Ten is SO much better than anything else!,"I am a huge PJ fan and own every CD they've made. I was so excited to get this new CD based on all the reviews I had read. Unfortunately, for me, you may as well group this one in with the rest of their recent mediocre releases. There are a couple of good songs - probably the ones you'll hear on the radio, but the rest are quite forgettable. Every time they release a new CD, it just reminds me of how good Ten is."
1,Latest is not greatest,"After reading some of the very positive reviews both by 'professional' rock critics and by PJ fans I was really excited to hear this new album but after listening to the album several times, I have to say that I'm sorely dissapointed. In fact it was difficult for me to try and listen to this multiple times hoping that it would grow on me.The hype about this being their best album in 10 years is just that - hype. I truely respect this band and have enjoyed most of their albums but sorry to say I can't see how this stacks up as one of their better albumns. IMHO a couple of good songs does not make the whole album worthy of four or five stars.If you're new to PJ check out just about anything else from them.......sorry guys"
1,Awful.,"This is quite possible is one of the most boring and tiring albums ever released, there is absolutley nothing good or exciting about Pearl Jams eighth album. Who would of thought ""like most bands end up doing"" they went commercial, this album will stay on peoples minds for about the length of the record playing time, and then forgotten.For people unfamilair with Pearl Jam start with Ten then work your way down to Yield or Binuaral, after that they sounded completley bored and so will you be if you listen to this album."
2,Ouch!,"I love Pearl Jam. They're songwriting skills and emotion made them great in the 90's and early 00's. Unfortunately, I'm very disappointed with this album. It has terrible sound quality, like it was recorded in someone's garage. The voice, drums, bass, guitars, all sound distorted like they're overdriving the microphones, so it's hard to listen to. The other reviews indicate Pearl Jam is back in form and compare this to Ten. I don't know what album they were listening to.Maybe that same Pearl Jam I loved still exists but you wouldn't know it from this recording. On a side-note, what the heck is going on with the artwork? It's full of mutilated body parts and grotesque images."
1,What Happened to Pearl Jam????,"It appears that people either love or hate this album. Unfortunately I hate it. I have been buying PJ albums since the day after Ten debuted on the video channel (whichever one it was back then, at least it played music unlike now), and they have been going progressively down hill. I thought this one might be different after hearing World Wide Suicide, so I bought it the second it was released (literally, I opened the box of CD's for them). I have forced myself to listen to it repeatedly, but it just won't click. I find that most of my most treasured albums take at least three good listens to start to click. This one just won't. Nothing sticks in my head besides the first single. It's all disappointing.Luckily I bought 10,000 Days on the same day."
1,What happened?,"As a long time fan of the Seattle,WA. alternative underground explosion that hit like a bullet 15 years ago (Nirvana/Soundgarden/Pearl Jam) I have to say this is by far the worst Pearl Jam album I have ever heard. It's the kind of record you will soon find at a gas station when buying that soda to keep you awake for a long trip down I-5(for $1.99)In fact one might even save themselves some time by just going to a flea market where I promise every booth will have a copy on sale for a quarter. If Eddy want's to take a few years off he better spend that time creating at least an above average CD. Im am very dissapointed!!!"
2,Much ado about nothing.,"Do I really need to type a review of this ""more of the same""? Seriouly people, stop hoping and start listening. They obviously ran out of ideas a few albums ago. If they're going to at least record a ""comeback album"" they should make sure that it's not recorded ""underwater"" (production wise).P.J. can rock out and that will be cool. But stop make excuses for this sleepfest."
3,Mixed review...,"I have mixed emotions about this recording. It's enjoyable to me that the band is going back to the hard-edged approach that brought them recognition, but perhaps time has taken a toll. The recording is mushy and indistinct (the blame for that can most likely be placed at the feet of the engineer), but additionally the playing sounds a bit sloppy and lackluster and Eddie frankly seems to be having a bit of trouble singing to pitch. The guitar tone is horrid, as if a bargain-bin mike was set up in the far corner of a garage with a cheesy amp as a source. Still, though, some of the magic is still there. I have respect for what these guys have done, and I found myself enjoying simply hearing them again."
5,Could It Get Any Better?,"The anger in Eddie Vedders voice on this album speaks for itself. You can hear the passion of they're message in every track of this album. Ive been a long time fan since i was 10, and Pearl Jam has yet to dissapoint me. What a classic, this world needs this album now. Great timing."
4,Part of a whole,"It is discouraging to read some of these reviews because they miss the point of PJ entirely. Knowing and apperciating PJ is discovering the body of their work. For many their music is a journey that is personal and takes time to discover. Each album has gems that connect on a personal level, lyrics that touch the soul, and tell a story. PJs music is about ourselves, our culture, our religion, our politics, our struggles and truths. Many times those connections are revealed after hearing a song several times or maybe the very first time. It is no lie that many times a single line has brought me to tears or caught in the back of my throat and those lines are found throughout their work. This album, Pearl Jam is a continuation of their story. It is powerful and should not be missed. It gives individuals, like me a voice and sense of connection to the bigger picture--That is the magic of Pearl Jam."
3,considered honesty,"This album is a very big shock to the system.........this may apear a different band the formula disapearedbut give it time... its worth itgone is the intensity drive passion and poetry however........For the first time PJ apear to have made a very friendly album -almost- happyYou wont quite want to go out and change the world with it ...... nor will you continue hating your parents.....a good car in the summer albumTracks like WWS and Severed Hand are truely great songs and should be amazing live as will unemployable and Gonebasicallydisjointed and drifting .........still great fun and will keep lots of people very happy ...............looking forward to the future.......but dont think theyre in as much a rush to change the world sadly anymore... do buy it by any other bands standards its really great but for pearl jam i am a bit disapointed.if you want to be inspired or motivated buy any of their other albums esp Yield or Binaural, If you want a good time buy this..."
5,Great album,"People before me have gone into much more detail about the songs than I will. I am only writing this to say that if you once liked Vs and Vitalogy, you should get this album. I don't undestand why people have such a problem with PJ's experimentation phase, but in this case there is none of it, we have a short and sweet grunge rock album just like in the old days. The songs are well performed and the track list flows well: I wouldn't change anything. ..well except the cover artwork..."
5,Good To Have 'Em Back,"It is well about time for a new statement from the Seattle boys. Time to hit the road with a new album! Eddie Vedder sounds raw and energized and his lyrics are full of piss and vinegar in as timely a fashion as ever. Matt Cameron gets better each time out and really kicks it up a notch. Clearly the right wing's attempt to hijack America has inspired the band to their best efforts. The songs styles are very familiar, a tad too much so if the songs weren't so damned good. The first two cuts are as good as any Pearl Jam album has ever opened with, the first with a blistering Stone solo and a headbanging crescendo, the second with a catchy hook that just screamed 'make me the single'! The closers are the stylistic breakouts, a soul ballad that builds and builds followed by another ballad with lovely Mike-Stone-jeff interplay. The closers show this band is still growing. The lyrics show they have not forgotten their roots. Very encouraging."
4,Opening for Tom Petty,"I bought this based on World Wide Suicide, their appearance on Saturday Night Live and the fact that it is self titled, and now that they are on J records I felt it was Pearl Jams way of saying, take a look at us once again. Plus I wanted to get ready to see them open for Tom Petty. I love how stripped down the album is, with some of the songs being a little weird but in a good way. Strong lyrically and very interesting musically. It is a rare CD that rocks and is still mellow at the same time. I also like that the bass lines were not forgotten in most of the songs. Not flashy or glossy by any means, and I really liked Eddie Vedders voice being mic'd so close. The album artwork on the inside is incredible."
3,HT,"I've got my copy today from Amazon (delivered sooner than scheduled, thanks guys) and I feel a bit dissappointed..and worried. Our most cherished band's latest release is now-let's face it-mainstream. Pearl Jam has always meant innovation in its own right. Where did the flair go? Though last 3 tracks shine, which seem most musically coherent and true to Pearl Jam sound.I cannot compare...I cannot compare..."
2,There are much better Pearl Jam albums,"If you're a hardcore fan of Pearl Jam you already know that the magic was on Ten, Vs, and Vitalogy. Since then Pearl Jam has released some good stuff (Yield), some average stuff (No Code), and some bad stuff (Binaural, Riot Act). This release falls into the good category. Sure, there's a few good songs that will sound great live but Pearl Jam's music still lacks that special element it used to have. There are no anthems like ""Alive"" or ""Jeremy"", no heavy rockers like ""Animal"" or ""Go"", and definitely no classic ballads like ""Black"" or ""Indifference"" or ""Nothingman"". Pearl Jam was touched by the music Gods early in their career but alas the Gods have moved on and given the power to Jeff Scott Soto and Dramagods."
1,Come on people...,"I am a huge fan of early Pearl Jam, but just because this album says ""Pearl Jam"" doesn't mean its good. ""World Wide Suicide"" is probably the best song on the album, and that song totally stinks. Quit fooling yourselves. Its OK to admit that your once-favorite band has grown old."
1,Their WORST Album!,"I've been a fan of Pearl Jam since the Ten days, so it's not like I never heard of them, OK!This is their WORST album to date, uncatchy songs, weird guitar riffs and rhythms, vocals suck, weak meaningless solos, even the cover art is weak.Here is their Albums List From Best To Worst.VSTENVITALOGYYIELDNO CODERIOT ACTBINAURALTHIS ALBUM"
2,"Another '90s Band, Another Medicore 2006 Album","The title really says it all. It's nothing special. Those who hailed it as some sort of ""return to form"" haven't listened to early PJ enough. That's not to say there aren't *some* redeeming qualities here, but it's an extremely inconsistent effort that, in the end, wasn't worth the wait or the hype."
3,Ummm.... not quite,"It SEEMS more energetic and the lyrics are good poetry (gotta read the lyric book, you will not make them out binaurally.) Ed's quite a poet; can do without the politics. You want to talk about a reviving album.... Pearl Jam's Yield. No politics, just a solid album that sounded fresh at the time (and still does). But that was long ago now, I guess. You know what was Avante-Garde? ""You are"" off Riot Act. Make a whole album like that; make the next grunge, whatever it would be called (Trance rock? Techrock?) But, I suppose it would have to come from a band with members still in their 20s. PJ have had their time. To compare current work, PJ is not quite as good as RHCP (another older band that is still functioning.) PJ didn't have as many problems in their past as RHCP, hence they are less interesting, i guess. Just some theories..... It's token PJ energy; it doesn't feel real."
1,they are ok but i didnt like this album,"i have 10 and at one point had vs. although i thought ten only had 4 good songs (jeremy,alive,even flow,black) and the other ones were bleh.in vs they were still creative. stuff like daughter and rearview mirror were cool and the rest was ok i guess. i didnt like it enough to buy vitology. only some good songs mixed with an album of whatever ones seems to be their technique for making cds.today i relistened to 10 and its a great album. mcready in great form.ok so i just finished listening to this new album. its whatever. nothing stood out for me. mike mcready does 3 sec solos. their sound is too polished. vedders voice annoys me a little.i really would give 2 stars but nah."
4,Still good,"Most great older band's new music is complete crap (Metallica, mostly), but this CD is a great addition to Pearl Jam's awesome history. It's no ""Ten"" but it'll still let you rock out pretty good. A lot of bands struggle to write as good of music as they used to, but Pearl Jam succeeds on this one."
4,Nice return to form,"Pearl Jam has been my favorite back since high school, but admittedly I started losing interest with their two consecutive mediocre albums (Riot Act, Binuaral). I wasn't sure that they had a good album in them anymore, but luckily this new CD has provem me wrong. My favorites so far are Unemployable, Big Waive, Inside Job, and Marker in the Sand. The only negative I can think of is the album doesn't have a ""classic"" PJ song (there is no Rearview Mirror, Alive, Jeremy, Better Man, Corduroy, etc), but either way, after all this time, it is great to see PJ relevant again and I can't wait to catch them live this year."
5,Pearl Jam,"Pearl Jam is back after Riot Act with a new record that blows all preconceived expectations. Yes. Ed, Stone, Mike, Jeff and Matt have put together a cohesive and solid album. A Versus vibe is all over this record with strong punkish songs, exploding solos, melodic riffs, incredible drums and bass lines and Ed's voice giving 101% on each track.Thank you PJ for opening the window and letting fresh air come through."
5,The words are too important = @,"I own every album except Binural & No Code. Also, I am wondering when/if they'll have 'Picture in a Frame' on a new album soon?This rock group still has it and always did. If you're more into the typical 'hype' of the music industry...Pearl Jam is definitely NOT FOR YOU!I love the messages in the songs- the feelings of being 'human' on this crazy messed-up planet.Honestly, I am never burnt out on their music...I don't believe I ever will. (Proudly, I have a Pearl Jam logo tattooed on my wrist along with: corduroy, i am mine, save you, & come back- 'do the evolution' is on the back of my neck!)"
3,goethe,"I'm always amazed by the bad reviews of yield. Yield is a great album but not for head bangers. This new album is for HB's - which is probably why it receives such praise. Yield, Riot Act and Live at the Garden are the best."
4,"Oh, jingleboy, jingleboy....","As a professed ""metalhead"" why were you even bothering with Pearl Jam in the first place? They have never been, nor have they claimed to be, metal.Oh, and while you may think that the substance is what made them good, the fact is they are good. It is your OPINION that they are not.Still.... A metalhead giving Pearl Jam a try?That's just freaking weird, man."
5,Worn out lyrics from a tired band,"WORLD WIDE SUICIDE! This song rocks my socks off! Complete with trite lyrics and a washed up lead singer, Pearl Jam really over did themseleves this time. I thought they were simply a relic from the early 90's grunge scene - and boy was I wrong! They've brought back talentless music to the masses! Thank you Eddie & friends!"
2,GK1981 is dead on!,"After reading GK1981's (September 2006) review i couldnt have said it any better myself. His song comparisons are dead on. I tried, oh did i try to like this album. I just could not get into it. I have liked just about every other pj album thats come out, but i cant get into this one. Its okay to admit that your favorite band has lost their touch!"
2,Pearl Whaaat ???,"I'm very impresed for some reviews I read. The last album of Pearl Jam, Pearl Jam it's better than Stadium Arcadium of Red Hot Chili Peppers !!!These two albums are very diferent. Two diferent music styles. But if we compared the music quality of these two albums. The Red Hot chili Album it's very much complex & very much varied than Pearl Jam last album.This Pearl Jam grunge is very dirty ... I understand that this type of music is recorded in this type of sound. But come on !!! Nirvana album In Utero it's dirty but it's one hundred times much complex and cool than this Pearl Jam album.I give two stars ... because respect to this band carreer & because this album have a few cool songs, but is an overvalued album."
1,Not afraid to tell the truth about this CD.,I'm sorry to say I bought this CD based on hype and good reviews. Shame on me. It's boring. I really can't find one song that I even sort of like on in. Most of these reviews remind me of the fable of The Emperor's New Clothes! Everyone is afraid to tell the truth here. It just sucks. I was really disappointed.. Want to buy a very slightly used CD?
1,You can't go home again,This is a shadow of what Pearl Jam used to be. Skip it and break out your old CDs.
1,Disappointing,I am a big Pearl Jam fan and this album is musically and lyrically not very good at all. Don't believe all of these reviews. I was shocked when I listened to the CD the first time. The quality of the CD is very poor. On the first 4 songs it feels like they are rushing to play the music which is repetitive and unappealing to the ears. Then the CD mellows out a little bit. I really like a lot of thier softer music(loved Live at Benaroya Hall) but these songs don't do anything for me. A couple of more bland rock songs are follwed by the best part of the CD. The last 3 songs sound like a gift after listening to the first 10. Overall very disappointing. Can't wait for the Chili Peppers. I heard their double CD on VH1.com and it sounds great.
2,Sucked in once again,"I own every Pearl Jam album. I was always blown away by the passion of their earlier work, but the CDs in later years were passionless. Each time a new CD was released, reviewers would praise the latest CD, but each work became weaker and weaker, although each had a few bright spots. Although, Riot Act was dismissal from beginning to end. I read reviews of the latest work which said the old Pearl Jam is back. They said the band had the passion and hooks from the earlier days. They are wrong. Although Pearl Jam is still better than most ""mainstream"" bands on the radio, this work is still very disappointing. They have tried to regain their passion, but it sounds and feels forced. It is evident that they are angry about the state of America and the world, but they no longer know how to express that anger in their music."
1,SUCKS,"Not the Pearl Jam of the 90's this CD SUCKS bad, there are no good songs on it..highly disappointed"
2,Should've been better... not bad,"This doesn't suck, but after the second album, I'm constantly trying to find the band that I was SO into. I like some weird stuff like they played on 'No Code'. If you're a fan, you remember 'Mankind'. THAT was a real treat.I'm a fan, and this is getting closer to the Rock I wanna hear, but just not close enough. 2.5 stars actuallly."
2,Some good songs but still lacking,"I read many reviews before i bought this album. I was under the impression that this cd would be similar (in energy and emotion) to Ten, Vs, and Vitalogy. I was wrong! The album has many ""mainstream""-type songs which lack in screaming and originality. I miss the Pearl Jam of old.Save your money and just download a few songs like Wasted Life, Worldwide Suicide, and Marker in the Sand from the internet (pay sites of course). The album as a whole is not a must buy. Sorry, but it's the truth."
1,The Worst,"These guys must hate music. Because they are the worst. And they have paved the wave for awful bands like Nickleback. Pearl Jam is for people who just stopped listening to Jimmy Buffett and Bearnaked Ladies. And then they decided to move on. These songs contained here are the worst ever. And Pearl Jam is the worst ever. I laugh when I listen to these songs...are you seroius. Yes. They are and that is what makes it even worse. All of the songs seemed forced. Like an eighth grader wrote it for the talent show at summer camp. This music is detached from nature and is false. Even 10, looking back is some pretty gawd awful stuff...But there are Pearl Jam fans. And they love thier Jam. And who am I to say. I know some of them and they are nice people. But when it come down to music...There is just no talking to them...Check out some other ""rock"" bands out there...and explore your world.Don't sit in the mud..."
1,Terrible album from Pearl Jam.,"NOT IMPRESSED.I was expecting a lot from this legendary band but this albums sounds like a cheap copy of the Who. I highly DO NOT recommend this album. If you want to hear a raw garage band type of album without any crisp guitaring or vocals, get this. Vedder sounds the same. Have you heard spin the black circle? This whole album sounds like that, but a lot more worse. Where are the solos, Mike McCrady?If I could give this a ZERO, I would.- Andy"
1,"Six of one, half a dozen of the other","It's an election year.What does that mean?Pearl Jam releases another, *yawn*, album.Of course we get the obligatory, vitriolic, whining of the self righteous malcontent Eddie Vedder. I swear, this man has no range in vocals. It's either: sneer, growl, or mumble.The lead guitarist tries his best to steal lame licks from the School of Hendrix.Didn't this over-rated Seattle schlock grunge go out of style circa. 1998?Virtually every Pearl Jam album is interchangible. They've been cranking out the same, tired, schtick for at least 12 years now.And, of course, while their time has come and gone (they hardly make a dent in the charts anymore), their mind-numbed fans eat up this worn out crud.I'm sure my humble review will raise the ire of the fans of the band. But it is the harsh truth. The outside world has changed. Bill Clinton is no longer president. Time to step out of your bubble and smell the fresh air."
1,Not Nirvana,Pearl Jam is not Nirvana.They will never be Nirvana.They suck.They have always sucked.Their lead singer runs around on stage. He doesn't play guitar. Give me a break.Pearl Jam is what we've got left from the 90s. That and Green Day.It's sad.
2,Bar lowered,"2 1/2One of the dreaded ""rocking comeback"" discs you hear about your old favorite bands producing, only to witness its faded out, rather limited glory and realize how comparatively tame expectations had become over time. I try to keep an ear on these old chums, but gloating reviews of course thrust higher expectations then logical. The release is a perfect encapsulation of the musty, distort-chord rock they are doing functionally well these years- perhaps even to the extent that there are no great songs but all decent ones. To expect any real hard hitting melodic power of yore would be a mistake."
3,Has Eddie Run out Of things to Write About???,"To start, this album is not bad, but its not great. If your looking for the Pearl Jam that put out Ten & Vs, well, those days are gone. You have to remember that we are dealing with a band that is 15 years older and has taken their music in a completely different direction.I agree with others that the bush bashing is getting old-- okay we get it. Is there anything else to write about eddie????? I'm no Bush fan, but find something else to pour your heart into. We get it already.This is not a must have album- its just another basic rock album with a few okay singles on it. Nothing that will blow you away from start to finish.Still, pearl jam still puts out better albums then these new one hit wonders that are getting all the radio play today."
5,One of the best songs in the album,"The self titled Pearl Jam album had one of the best songs in it. I cannot relate to anyone who after listening to ""Come Back"" does not want to buy this album."
1,Disappointed at first,"I pre-ordered this album through the TEN club. I felt the whole album was a let down at first, but after listening to it 5-6 times, I'm starting to hear some good Pearl Jam in there. I don't think that the vocals/instuments mesh into a complete package on most songs, Eddie almost seems like he is singing to some other music half the time. I feel like they are trying to play harder for the sake of playing harder, not to create songs that truly stand out. I think tracks 5 and 12 are my picks on this album."
1,Don't waste your money,"Nothing good on this CD, a big dissapointment. Songs are boring, and not even one good song."
1,Please,...As usual the politics ruin another pretty good effort by a great band...Vedder should get back to singing about homeless people and spinning records...W
1,Politics and Musicians,Thank god politicans don't try and play cheesy guitar in their speeches.And don't ask me why E. Vedder thinks he should make ignorant political speeches in his music.
2,bland album,"After all the rave reviews, I expected better.It's like an entire album comprised of all the bad songs on Riot Act. Why make garage music when you have the ability to create classic rock?Pearl Jam's working overtime trying to promote this album, which has gone a long way towards building hype. Don't believe it.Even the album's artwork is uninspired (especially inside)."
1,"a bore (in other words, usual Pearl Jam fodder)","Pearl Jam hasn't released anything decent since ""Ten"" (a masterpiece!) and this album is no different. Only the true die-hard fans that have no credible musical tastes will get anything out of this sloppy excuse of a release. There are only a couple of rare glimpses of the brilliance that was ""Ten"". For the most part, however, it will bore the hell out of you. The songwriting is lame and Vedder's voice is as annoying as ever. Plus, they continue to push their self-righteous and ignorant political views on us (see ""World Wide Suicide"") which just make them a laughing stock. Thankfully, I found this album online and listened to it before wasting any money on it."
4,Eddie should read this,"I have been Pearl Jam's largest fan since before they were Pearl Jam! First a few facts:Pearl Jam is the finest live act in RockEddie Vedder is the best performer in RockThe band is amazing together as a unitIsn't it nice to review a true band from the 90's?Now, on to the album. Great. Buy it. I'm from a red state and don't get into the politics too much, so I can say that his lyrics(their lyrics) are out of this world. The album moves along at a nice speed. Life Wasted, Wolrd Wide Suicide, Severed Hand, Inside Job, Come Back, and Comatose are my favorties as of now. I think Severed Hand is their best rock song in years. Good God, it has been a while since they rocked. I stuck with them through no code, yeild,(I liked both of these cds) binural, and riot act. I did not care for riot act too much, and binural made be only want to hear out of one ear. So it is nice to again say that Pearl Jam is back on top of Rock!"
2,perl jam,this new album is being very much over rated....i feel this album only has a couple of good songs...would not reccommend...
3,Not as good as the first single,"I didn't even recognize Pearl Jam's first single, World Wide Suicide. It was fresh and rockin! I thought this may be a new sound for them. But I was disappointed, most of the CD is slow, typical sounding Pearl Jam songs."
3,"High expectations, but","overall the album didn't deliver. Critics do this album a disservice by mentioning Ten in the same sentence, it's extremely misleading. Artistically, they could not be more different. From track 1 to track 11, Ten was an unbelievable masterpiece of its time: Vedder's vocals had depth, the band was phenomenal and the music had direction. ""Pearl Jam"" just sounds like a mish mash of random musical thoughts, with occasional glimpses of their former brilliance.I wanted so much to love this album. I miss the PJ I fell in love with over a decade ago."
2,Kinda Boring...,"I love Pearl Jam's old stuff and I was really excited for this album, but it's really just kinda blah. There werent any great guitar parts, no exciting vocals. I guess this album is going into the ""listening to music but not really listening"" section of my collection. It works for background noise, but beyond that...."
2,weak effort,"...like some other reviews stated, this disc is much like Riot Act in that it has the same crappy production (the drums sound flat and lame) and the same forgettable tunes. At least Riot Act had ""Love Boat Captain"", I don't think this CD has one song that's even as good as that. I don't think they really 'have it' anymore...too bad, they were once relevant."
5,pearl jam rocking again,"Not 10 , not even VS, but this release has faster pace to it than anything since Vitology. Comparable to the Yield album. But, not as good as Ten or Vs. The album songs display a sense of maturity, something different in general, and a bit grown up in mood. It's as if they suddenly settled down with a need to go back to their real roots of rebellious ecstatic uplifting tunes of grunge. Perhaps, a realization of what really works for them, doesn't necessarily work for their listeners. All in all an awesome piece of work. Going back on tour probably helped alot as well."
3,"Pretty Good, Not Great","I like and enjoy this album, but it's not their best. There are some moments here are greatness, but some of the songs fall a bit flat. The production on the album also sounds thin, and not lush like some of their other recording.Stand out songs: Marker In The Sand, Life Wasted, Severed Hand, Army Reserve, and Parachutes.OK songs: Comatose, World Wide Suicide, Inside Job, Unemployable, Come Back, Wasted Reprise and Big WaveNot so great: Gone"
3,"A solid album form a maturing band, ""This is often hard to digest""","Well,I haven&#65533;t bought the Cd, but i heard it in a music store from bigining to end. I liked it, after so many years i actually like the darn album. They are all maturing adults and the whole psychosocial proceses really influences the music quality in any human beings artistic expressi&#65533;n. Its not the best rock album of the year or the best PJ album, its just a really solid piece of artistic expressi&#65533;n from a group of middle aged men doing what they most enjoy, at least thats what i percive from their music.............Good Album................."
3,A little disapointing,"I have always been a huge Pearl Jam ever since 6th grade, and I was really looking forward to this album, but I was a little disapointed. The songs are pretty good but make no mistake-this is no masterpiece by any means. There are several great songs on here-Life Wasted, World Wide Suicide (the music is good, the lyrics are too propaganda-ish), Gone, Come Back, Inside Job and Severed Hand. But there are some bad songs on here too-Comatose (this is now my least favorite PJ song ever), Marker in the Sand and Unemployable arent that good either.If you were expecting beautiful songs like Off He Goes or Thumbing My Way, you won't find them here. If you want some noise, its here for you. Don't get me wrong-any Pearl Jam album beats most other musicians, but this won't beat any other previous Pearl Jam album."
2,Not for seed bead starters,"This is not a starter book even though bead stitch techniques are shown much-enlarged in photographs. Jeanette's book provides an excellent springboard for the intermediate to advanced beader. The projects use seed beads and you will be required to be as competent with thread tension as you are with netting, brick stitch and peyote stitch. Are you bored with too-simple projects? Try some of Jeanette's ideas."
2,Very Disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I was expecting patterns that were more up to date with the times and jewelry that I could wear to work and out to dinner. These patterns weren't difficult to understand but like I said, who would want to wear it out of the house. Possibly little children would wear while playing house or something. Extremely disappointed. Don't waste your money."
5,Very useful.,"I have to give our elderly cat subcutaneous fluids, a daunting task for one person! This product allows me to do the job alone with FAR less stress for the cat AND me. SHe's a tiny cat, under 6 lbs., but I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and bought the medium instead of the small."
3,"Nice Comp, Lousy Sound","This excellent compilation is severely undercut by truly poor sound quality. Even vinyl played on a good system sounds WAYYY better. But, now that the original albums have been nicely remastered from the original multitrack tapes, there is happily no need for you to shell out your bucks for this relic of the Dark Ages of digital remastering! Start with the reissue of ""...Takes Off"" and work your way up through the catalogue. Your head will be nicely fed."
5,Linda Dominique Grosvenor author of FEVER,"""Word of Mouth"" [he say, she say] the poem rings true as does the entire collection. Terry A. O'Neal is a wordsmith. ""Loose Change,"" ""A Bottle's Blues,"" and ""Behind Romance,"" are some of my favorites and posess words that take you poetically and hold you hostage, leaving you finally understanding what drives some people to write poetry. Her poems are crisp, clear and are varied in that they range from love to a prayer for the people. The Poet Speaks in Black is a collection that you'll be glad that you purchased and will encourage your friends to own for years to come."
5,Struts they make a car ride smoother,They are struts they were easy to install after rust fell out. Monroe is always the way to go for normal cars.
2,1/2 a book,"I ordered this book because by title/summary it was perfect for my essay. 48pgs for $13 wasn't an even exchange, but I figured the information would make up for it. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because it arrived quickly. HOWEVER, this book is advertised as being 48pgs. It *does* have 48pgs. What the summary neglects to tell you is that 25 of 48 pages are BLANK. The pictures and information stop on pg 23"
4,A very creepy Korean treat,"I heard that this was a good film and decided to check it out. I was definitely not disappointed. Black House is an expertly crafted mystery-horror-thriller about a rather timid insurance investigator who stumbles upon an unexpected, horrifying situation in the course of his work. To be more specific would risk spoiling one of the best ""unexpected treasures"" I've unearthed in quite a while. What I will say is that the acting is top-notch, the direction is perfectly suited to the subject matter, and the writing is nice and clever. Anyone who enjoys Asian horror will find much to appreciate in the unrated version of Black House."
2,"Moody, creepy, thrilling ... and yet, stupid.","Basically, this movie does a lot right, and yet finds a way to fail at the end.It's sort of like how Tony Romo of the Dallas Cowboys can have a great statistical season, yet somehow find a way to end it on a sour note - botched handling of a field goal, game ending interceptions, anyone?That's how this movie plays out.A caring, nerdy and haunted insurance agent winds up involved in the case from hell, when he unwittingly gives out some personal information to a potential client on the phone. It has a nice premise, but in the end, this individual (for the sake of not giving away too much of the plot) turns out to be almost superhuman in her tolerance for pain, and the ways that she escapes death.I defy anyone to attempt to make sense of the ending of this movie. The last 10 to 15 minutes are downright bizzarre and illogical."
3,Average,"Average ""horror"" movie. Thought the synopsis was interesting so I decided to purchase. Story was ok with an occasional good scene."
2,Dresser Plan,"Blueprint is nice, but needs step by step instructions. Disappointed with the overall plan considering how much it cost. I would not recommend buying this plan."
3,Only 4 or 5 really good tracks,"This album isn't nearly as good as their earlier releases such as The End.""Sippin On Some Syrup"" and ""M.E.M.P.H.I.S."" are the only classic tracks on here. ""Sippin..."" features a great beat, catchy hook, and worthwhile guest appearance from UGK, while ""M.E.M.P.H.I.S."" is just an all-out banger featuring the Hypnotize Camp Posse.""Touched Wit It,"" featuring former No Limit Soldiers Fiend and Mr. Serv-On, is also a nice track. But outside of maybe one or two others, the album is filled with mediocrity. Nothing else stands out, and this ends up being nothing more than an average album.It's a shame too, because this album had a huge build up, and it only ends up disappointing.If you're a die hard 3-6 fan, you might enjoy this. Otherwise, save your money."
3,How Long Can Kyle Depend On It?,"What the hell was the reviewer from Toledo talking about? First of all, it's not true that ""all the merchants on the last cut took a soroptical view of King Dong's property"". How the hell could they when only Sharpe and Grimsvald knew about it in the first place, huh? Not only did Slicey Dice kick some serious ass in ""Beevin' up the Zugga"" (track 25), he even alluded in the most elliptical way to what happened 'tween him and Clark Massie, and it ain't even what you think. Worst of all, the Toledo reviewer has no business makin' up that sh*t 'bout Turk and Gilroy. IT NEVER HAPPENED! Okay?Someone oughta slap young Kyle upside the head with a brick for his lyin' dumbass review. If ya don't know the rap, ya gonna get slapped! Yeah."
4,not the best from three 6,"44 killers is a bangin intro song, juicy j rips it up on weak ass bitch, sippin on some syrup is perfect 4 chillin, act like u know me is bangin all members bring it, my second favorite song on here, i'm so hi is more of a song to listen to while ur high instead of while ur gettin high and is hot, who run it is a straight up ridin/club song and my favorite on here.the rest of the songs ain't bad i just don't listen to em but definitely worth the $$. memphis 10 runnin thangs always and 4 eva."
3,"Weak by Three 6 standards, but way above pop rap","This album could've been much better, but it certainly is nothing for Three 6 to be ashamed of. My biggest criticism is actually the most popular song, ""Sippin On Some Syrup."" I would've liked to have heard the rest of Three 6 rapping on it, and UGK left off. In the end, there are too many weak spots, and not enough good songs to make up for it. Basically, WTSC is an ""easy-listening"" rap album (although 99.9% of rap albums are), not like their early material, which you could get into a little more. Take it to your parties and play it on the road, but don't try to get attached."
3,Three 6's Weakest CD,"This CD was very average IMO. It doesn't hold a candle to The End or Ch. 2, and Da Unbreakables was a better album. This album just didn't sound like the group put 100% into it. The beats for the most part were on point & they delivered with tracks that make you wanna smack your own mother like Weak A** B**** and Put Ya Signs, and some tracks were all around hotness like Whatcha Know and Sippin On Some Syrup. At the same time, there were quite a few filler tracks like From Da Back (which was old), Tongue Ring, Take A Bump, Who Run It (also old), and Just Anotha Crazy Click. Crunchy Black (the ODB of the South) even got a solo track. Crunchy cant rap to save his life but his one liners are classic. Gotta give em props for F*** Yall H***s tho, any song that gives me the chance to rep my hood gets me crunk."
5,ILL HOT SH*T,"I GOT A SYSTEM, AND THIS IS WHAT I PLAY TO BUMP IT TO. I DONT CARE WHAT NONE OF Y'ALL HATERS SAY 666 MAFIA MEM. TENN. R THE KING OF THE SOUTH CRUNCHY BLACK GANGSTA BOO LORD INFAMOUS HOLDIN IT DOWN. MY FAV SONG OFF THIS ALBUM IS I GOT MINE, AND ITS OV, AND EVERYTHING ELSE EVERY SONG IS HOT. SO PICK THIS CD UP AND SUPPORT THESE RAPPERS, THEY DONE PULLED THEIR WEIGHT IN THE GAME AND WILL CONTINUE SO QUITE HATIN."
3,M&M's Best Yet...,"This is Eminem's best album yet. He still has a long way to go before he reaches the heights achieved by Slappy Mack or Grobo, but he is definitely showing improvement. I think one reason he doesn't get as much respect as he deserves is because he is a white man working in the whole space-jazz genre. We will have to wait until reverse racism has died before we will see true acceptance of what he has achieved here. Meanwhile, this album is proof positive that white boys CAN groove to that syncopated rhythm and stay just behind the beat, like a real cool cat should. He's sooper groovy and only an idiot refuses to admit it."
3,Nice,"Triple 6 definetely has it's ups and downs, and this set is no exception. While Sippin on Da Syrup and Who Run it! remain my favorites, there are dull parts to this album, and after a day of listening to the cd, you will probably end up putting it away until next week. SOme tracks are dope, others bothersome; all in all it is a mediocre cd. It will creep to your player every now and again, but overall you'll be listening to another disc. Buy it if you're a fan, if you can't live without sippin on Da sisurp -- otherwise, download it."
2,Not as good as I thought,"The first woman doing this DVD was disrespectful to Greek culture. She constantly laughed behind the locals backs, it was very unprofessional and rude. Overall, both sections failed to show enough of the country. In the beginning one gets the sense that a lot of historical sites were going to be reviewed, but so. Not a lot is going on in this DVD. It really failed to capture Greece's spirit and culture."
2,Disrespectful to Greeks,"I thought that Christina Chang made an absolute fool of herself in this video. She moon walked on the Acropolis in front of the Parthenon, and spit out the mastic that she was offered on Chios. The Globe Trekker hosts need to be more respectful of the foreign countries they visit."
3,Disappointed.,"Either Greece isn't spectacular, or these hosts just didn't do a good job of presenting it to us. I was looking forward to watching this video, but was sadly disappointed. I hope that visiting Greece will change my opinion."
2,Not even close,"Besides what other reviewers have written about Chang's inadequacy, this looks like it was made very hastily and as a result it misses a lot of important things that could have been covered in the same amount of time. The choice of islands eg, is arbitrary and irrational."
2,Christina Chang is Immature,Christina Chang treats Greece and Greek culture in a very snide and condescending manner. If you want a immature kid for a guide - then this is perfect.
2,Pallino is a disappointment,"I bought this gift for my 5 year old. I thought it looked like a great educational toy. However, I tried it before I gifted it and decided not to give it. The reason - the balls do not go easily into the slots. What a shame because this is a really neat game."
3,not enough for a developer,"I read the ISDN part of the book and then stopped. I am a software developer and have worked on several device drivers, eg, ATM and Ethernet under UNIX. This book tells you the basics about ISDN. It is easy to read and understand. But if you want to work on ISDN protocol stack, hardware design, or device driver, this book is definitely not enough. You want to read some other ISDN books."
4,Very good for beginners,"Uyless Black has great skill in technical writing. This book is not for those who need to know SS7 to a low level, or need to know the protocol inside it. But as a book for the beginner or someone who does not need to know SS7 inside out, then this book is easy to understand, and has appropriate coverage of both ISDN and SS7. So in short not a large book, nor is it in depth, but what is there is well written, and therefore for someone who only wants light coverage it is very good."
5,Loudness ga suki desu ka? You Should.They Still Sound Amazing,"Nihongo wa wakarimasen? If you THINK you don't understand Japanese culture, just listen to this & you'll be convinced that perhaps the gulf between us is not quite so great as we had thought.I had the pleasure of seeing these guys quite a few times in San Francisco back in the 80s and they were absolutely amazing. In fact, my friends and I were so blown away by them the first night, that we went back to see them just days later at another night club--and everytime they returned to California after that.Still, when I listen to these guys, I think to myself ""how the hell did they know to do THAT there in THAT way? THAT particular vocal touch THERE? THAT particular chord right THEN?"" These guys were amazing live and this album does their live shows justice. After all these years, they still sound great, and in many ways--and quite ironically--they are THE epitome of American-style 80s hardrock."
2,Good examples but with no instruction,"This book, as the rest of this series by Charusin lacks explanation; the examples are interesting, but the book consists only of move lists and diagrams with no explanation of the rationale behind the moves.It would probably be a good book if you have a master available to go with you through the games, but if you are an average chess player by me you will be dissapointed."
4,An informative behind the scenes look at Formula One,"A well written book covering the various players (the teams, FIA, advertising, sponsors and the media) that make up Formula One today. The book traces the origins of the sport and how it has evolved into the media event that it is today.The book is an easy read and makes watching Formula One racing more interesting."
1,"Biased, sterile and boring.","The author collected the background for his book exclusively from British sources and the result reads as an us -the British- versus them -the Europeans- accounting of grievances. The British teams are filled with geniuses while Hitler runs Mercedes Benz and Ferrari is filled with politicizing mumbling fools. The writing is sterile and filled with inaccuracies and one wonders how it is possible to write such a boring book about such an exciting sport.However when time came to sell this tome the publisher placed two F1 cars on the jacket, they are wisely both Ferraris."
1,A serious disappointment,"Sometimes things are not what they appear to be on the cover. And this is one. If you want a DVD that is mostly interviews and interrupted music, this is for you. Cutting in and out of the outstanding perdormance of Pirates was horrible. This DVD is an injustice to a great band."
2,Only for the hard core,"Some great footage from the early days, but the bits are too far apart and too short. Most of the tunes on this disc from the Black moon tour aren't up to usual ELP standards.If you're looking for an ELP concert disc, this ain't the one. Get this one after you've gotten the rest.Also, I have to agree that this disc wasn't put together very well. Very hap hazard and disjointed. The sound's pretty good, though."
4,Some people forget....,"....that a lot of DVD's out now are just straight reissues of product previously only available on VHS, hence no extras.The critisism I've read for this release is unjust. Complaints of ""they don't know how to make a DVD"" are rediculous. This is the exact same material that was on the original VHS and it's about the same price as when I bought the VHS new. Some may complain that interviews interrupt the music constantly and I agree, that is annoying if it's supposed to be a concert film. However, this is a DOCUMENTARY! That's the way they are.And it's not a bad documentary at all. There's cool old footage and new interviews with the band during the comeback ""Black Moon"" period. I do feel they could have gone a little bit more in depth and shown more old footage and presented more interviews but what is there is fine. Not outstanding, but entertaining enough for ELP fans."
2,ELP Not welcome back,"This dvd was disappointing, knowing of the quality of ELPs work made this dvd hard to swallow.First off the quality is low with popping and clicking across the entire length of this dvd. The fact that is from 1992 is no excuse, I have an Ozzy concert from same year with much higher quality. Then on top of this not one whole song is ever played constantly being over shadowed by talking in the middle of songs is no way to make a dvd thats what extras are for. Its apparent that these people {the ones who produced this} had no idea how to make a good dvd. I do not like a supposed concert dvd with less music then talking. Ohh well with the poor quality it does not matter all that much. I was expecting so much more out of one of my favorite bands of all time. Don't buy it unless your a hardcore ELP fan even then.... Try the new Live DVD from ELP it's much better. On a side note for pure reference it's intresting historical perspective."
2,Misleading box information,"Very frustrating! ELP is one of my all-time favorite bands and there are so few movies on them. I guess someone tried to make some bucks out of this situation. The info on the box is misleading. There is not a single complete song available in this disc. Several interviews and footage were old and already presented on the multimedia track of their King Biscuit Flour Hour Live CD. This disc is simply a patch of old material, not exactly a documentary project. The Dolby 5.1 track is awfully mixed, so bad that I preferred to listen to the Dolby 2.0 one.A shame to release a disc with mostly old interviews available elsewhere, and glimpses of live performances. I guess the new ELP Live at the Albert Hall is the one I should have bought. Unfortunately it wasn't available at the store on the day I was easily fooled to buy this one as a real ELP DVD. The Welcome Back DVD should be a freebie/complement to the Albert Hall Live DVD, not sold as a separate stand-alone item."
1,Horrible quality...poor rep of ELP and unprofessional master,"This is the worst DVD I've seen...I love ELP so was completely interested in it, having seen 3 dates on the Black Moon tour myself. However, the constant cutting off of songs for interviews (why not just insert the interviews BETWEEN the songs, instead of cutting them?) makes it an ANNOYING view. ALSO, there is a HORRIBLE mastering issue/mistake, where the surround channel only outputs from the Left rear in 5.1 mode, with NO right rear output. I expect to hear that the company either recalls this master and reissues it to purchasers, or that the company producing it is bankrupt. DON'T BUY UNLESS THIS PROBLEM GETS CORRECTED!!!"
1,respect to the only source of excitement . ZERO stars,"Our time will be remembered for its music, not its politicians. Who remembers which king ruled Austria during Mozart? The same must be said about producers of this DVD. Folks behind the scene decided to get on the wagon of history by cutting up some immortal music and mixing the pieces with some interviews with the musicians.Joking is not appropriate here. You, the scissors-happy fools need to know that in the Ukrainian coal mines in the 1970-th and 1980-th my now dead brothers were yelling `oo a lucky man he was!"" You owe some respect to the only source of excitement in the endless dark labyrinths. We, the Emerson, Lake and Palmer fans, formerly or presently oppressed, demand release of all row footage in fool, no cuts, no butchering! No picking and choosing, please! Hadn't we had enough of the censorship! Interviews belong at extra-bonus section."
2,Waiting for the next comeback!,"When I bought this DVD I thought I would see more of the shows and less talking, or at least, the interviews apart from the shows (as Alice Cooper's Welcome to My Nightmare). Unfortunately most of music DVDs are released this way: interviews over the music/show. I liked the old footage, but I think there would be at least ONE complete song. ELP version of ""Fanfare"" is one of my favorite pieces but I didn't like the way they glued it from two different shows (it works best on CD). For die-hard fans only!"
3,I liked it for some strange reason!,"I have to agree with the other reviews of this DVD, in that no whole songs are played, and that is basically an INTERVIEW DVD. However, I guess that is why I liked it, because it presents the background of ELP that many of us haven't heard before. I've been a fan of ELP since day one, and saw their 1977 concert tour with the full orchestra BEFORE they had to abandon it. So, seeing the bits and pieces of that tour on the DVD brought back a lot of memories. But, I agree that ELP should put out a REAL concert album, like the California Jam concert, which I feel was their greatest work ever! I mean, it's about time and we've all waited long enough!"
1,performances chopped up with cheesy interviews,"Don't waste you time on this. All of the performances are chopped up with cheesy interviews. On the other hand, if you are such a total ELP fan that you will enjoy little excerpts of performance mixed in with little excerpts of interviews, maybe you'll like. Personally, I don't get it, and I wish that I had known what it was before I bought it."
1,ripped off,"I didn't mean to click even one star.What I recieved was an unauthorizized COPY of a DVD that won't play.It's the only time I've been ripped off using your site, but I thought you should know."
5,How to Become an Entrepreneur,"An outstanding synopsis of ideas about becoming a successful entrepreneur. Jerry Clum writes from his own interesting and personal experiences of creating one of the most successful franchise systems in the history of the country. This book will be especially valuable to anybody contemplating going into business for themself. Full of real-world meat and potatos ""stuff"" for new business owners. I wish I had read this gem many years ago."
1,Tissue of Lies from the UFO chasing Liar Chamish,"Save your money. Chamish is 100 times stupider and more idiotic than the worst ""911 Truth"" Cult of Conspiracy Nuts"
1,Clearly written by a psychotic refusing to take his medication.,"Chamish sees ""writing"" as a substitute for taking his meds. But no one else should waste a nickle on his lunatic ravings and subliterate ""writing""."
1,Barry Chamish... loon in a religious suit,"Who exactly is this Barry Chamish? Is he a gifted historian, or a typical nutjob? Well, to see for yourself, check him out on the web. You will find that good 'ol Barry is one of the head honchos when it comes to the UFO conspiracy that the Antichrist will come back with aliens in UFO's guiding him. No, as others have said, Barry Chamish's book on the Rabin conspiracy (with more holes in it than swiss cheese) is an insult to intelligence."
4,If it's true- We're in trouble!,"Barry Chamish's book will definently shock you. No matter what your own political views are, the facts brought in his book arise many questions. Personally, I disagree with his conclusion, and think he might be just a bit paranoid. But that does not mean he is totaly wrong. There are solid facts in his book that only a blind man or one who wishes to ignore the truth would over-look. Read the book with an open mind. You might find it distrbing- and so you should! As the x-files would say:""The Truth is Out There..:"" Enjoy"
1,A kindergarden kid could write better than this moron,A kindergarden kid could write better than this moron
3,FAIRLY ENTERTAINING,"Of course this book gets no points for originality since it is, as advertised, a retelling of the Cinderella tale. However, it was pretty good. I wish a little more action had taken place in London (a few more tantalizing encounters between the hero and heroine at some of the ton balls) and maybe the last half of the book wouldn't have been so slow. At least our hero is a man of honor (he doesn't just want to sleep with Lucy - he wants to marry her) which is a little different. He is definitely not a rake. Don't get me wrong! I love rakes, but Prince Charming does not fall into that category. Not a keeper although I will probably check out other KK books. Order a used copy."
2,it wasn't that great,"this book was a major dissapointment to me. The characters were wonderful, I loved them. But, to be blunt, the story line sucked. It was very unoriginal. The only time the book was good was when the story line strayed away from the Cinderella plot. I wouldn't advise u to by this book."
2,LOGO WARNING!!!!,"Another one of Goodtimes Stooge collections, ""Festival"" is just another rip-off disc of material available elsewhere in better form. Worst of all is the ""GT"" logo which appears throughout. This series of Stooge DVD's from Goodtimes are worthless."
4,A Movie For You To Cheer Up!,"""The Invisible Mom 2,"" is a really impressing movie. It cheers you up when you feel blue.There's this teenage guy, who discovers some kind of a machine. By mistake, he turned his mom invisible. Later, he and his mom face all kind of trouble going through daily life processes. I don't want to spoil the movie...cause what happens next is BIGGG!"
3,For Micky Fans,"OK, so this isn't a GREAT movie, but I did get a kick out of it. If you are a Micky Dolenz fan, it is worth seeing just for his role, which does fit him. The images it gives of the foster care system are laughable... My 4 year old was a bit scared of all the threatened violence in it. I'd watch it, but get it from the library."
5,AWESOME!,"I borrowed this CD off of a friend of mine and I fell it love with it. From the first note of Footloose to the ending Reprise, I was singing along. The duo in Almost Paradise is unbelievable. I can not wait to purchase my own copy of this CD. If you want a great Broadway soundtrack, this is your one to buy."
2,Why is this show still on Broadway?,"Even the 80's music that's usually great is awful on this cd. And the new music is some of the worst stuff I've ever heard. I gave it two stars only because ""Let's Hear It For the Boy"" and ""Footloose"" are well-done. Other than that, this cd would make a great coaster or frisbee...."
4,A lot of Fun!,"Footloose was probably one of the cheesiest broadway shows ever made, but one it also one of the most enjoyable original bway recordings. Filled with the films most loved songs and a few new ones, all you need to do is just have a lot of fun listening to it. Vocally the cast is incredible. Jeremy Kushnier as Ren displays a raw and intense quality to I'm Free (Heaven Help Me), I Can't Stand Still, and Footloose. Stacy Francis has an amazing voice that makes Lets Hear it For the Boy the highlight of the album and the show. Holdin Out For A Hero and Almost Paradise are also included and sound terrific. Mama Says sung by Willard is hysterical. Other songs don't fair as well. The new songs written just for the show, are standard broadway pop songs that don't seem to fit, but out Dee Hoty does what she can with the weak material and has a beautiful voice. There may be a few tracks you skip over, but overall a very enjoyable soundtrack that will make you get up and dance."
2,WORSE THAN CARRIE!!!,"This is show is by the same lyricist as Carrie. I have heard Carrie and am sad to say that Carrie is better!!! The best song in this show is ""Cant Stand Still"". I bet the dancing in the show is great but the songs just dont do anything for me. The singing is scary by most of the cast. Jeremy Kushiner is good. I would like to see this show on the stage so I could see how bad it is! This is still a fun CD. If you are in a happy mood it is good to listen to but some of the country songs in it are REALLY SCARY! That is why it is better than Carrie!"
2,ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,"The recording is ok, but save your money till the national tour comes to a town near you. The national tour is sooooooooooooo much better. Except Jermy Kushner is better than the guy in the National Tour."
5,Outstanding Performaces!,"Footloose is an amazing new musical with a vibrant and exhilarating score and book. I am currently appearing in a rendition of it and it is truly amazing! Do yourself a favor and buy this recording, for it will keep you entertained forever."
5,FOOTLOOSE is the show to see...Should have got all the TONYS,FOOTLOOSE....where is the best musical tony...I saw it this past week...and I have had the cd since the day it came out...FOOTLOOSE is the show...The cast(Jeremy Kushiner is GREAT)...The sets...the songs...and the dancing...WOW what a show...Next Long running musical
4,Makes you get up & dance & sing along,For anyone who grew up in the 80's this is a must have. It has all of the old favorites as well as some great new ones like---Mama Says... If you love dancing & singing aloud at the top of your lungs then this is the CD for you! Enjoy!!!
1,Save Your Money,I have about 300 original cast recordings and it's difficult to find one worse than Footloose. I am ashamed to say that I was even dragged to the show by a friend. It's 98% garbage...the only number in the show that even remotely worked was Let's Here It For the Boy. If you are yearning for some recycled pop music you'd be better off with Saturday Night Fever...though a close cousin is much more listenable.
1,This is truly disgusting,"This is a really bad album, Broadway cast recording or not. But, since it is an OBC recording, I will say that it is THE worst one ever made. One might argue that even though it's bad material, it's fun to listen to. Sorry...it just gave me a splitting headache. This stuff is bad. Really bad."
2,"If your into musicals, try RENT OBC cast recording instead.","Footloose danced into our hearts years ago when Kevin Bacon danced across the big screen, yet with this stage adaptation nothing even moves. This recording features very talented people, some so talented we may see them in the broadway hit RENT one day. The songs are all rusty, and so is the plot of the musical which they sing about. The producers seemed to want the play to reach out to people of the younger generations. This cd can't though, especially when the characters rap about religious figures who danced (pathetic and true). Instead of purchasing this cd, for now you should purchase other cast recordings such as RENT, where people don't rap about religion, and clear meaningfull songs are presented."
3,A landmark recording of a Broadway nightmare! (a hit flop),"This original cast recording is a must have for any fan of contemporary musical theatre. Like it's film to stage predecessors, ""Carrie"" and ""Big,"" it has some truly wonderful moments but contains more than a few moments that are truly cringe worthy. For example, the lyric, ""I'm.... Becoming a mime...""However...the following cuts are well sung and alive and make it worth owning: Footloose, The Girl Gets Around, Holding Out For A Hero, Let's Hear It For The Boy, Mama Says, and Almost Paradise.My three star rating is not quite an accurate reflection but rather a median. One listener would give it negative stars (if there is such a thing) while another might give it five stars without battting an eyelash. My advice...get ""Footloose""!!!"
2,A mostly blah recording of a mostly blah show.,"Like the movie on which it is based, there is little of true excitement or energy in the musical version of Footloose. Do not buy this CD for the mostly forgettable score or most of the performances. Buy it for Dee Hoty's excellent performance as Vi, Reverend Shaw's wife, and the uniquely interesting ""Learning to Be Silent."" Most of the rest of the disc--as well as most of the score and book from which this disc comes--can be left at the door."
1,Take off your sunday shoes and beat Dean Pitchford,"Wow! Is this show horrible! I'm sorry, I know the dancing is spectacular and everything, but since this is a review of the CD and not the show, I'm judging it simply on it's musical merit. It's repulsive! The lyrics are the most contrived and pointless things I have ever heard. Lines such as when Ren is refering to David in the bible he says 'Didn't like math, or geography, but check this out, he loved choreograpy'. That has to be one of the dumbest lyrics I have ever heard! There are two things, and two things only that save this CD, the songs 'Holding Out For A Hero', featuring a great fresh new arrangement of this classic 80's song, and the spine tingling 'Let's Hear It For The Boy', where the female playing Rusty delivers a vocal performance unlike anything heard for a long time on show CD's. And while these are great, shouldn't we expect more than that from a Broadway show? While it may be great to see, it's painful to listen to."
5,Cut loose! Footloose! Fantastic!,"I love the funky tunes, great singers, and music. It's the greatest CD! Don't miss it. Get it now! It's great to dance to, sing along with, have fun listening to it. I love it, and so will you!"
5,This cd is awesome!,"I really love the music on this cd. After seeing the broadway production, I had to have this soundtrack. My favorite songs are, ""Let's Hear it for the Boy"" and ""Mama Says (You Can't Back Down)"". The latter is hilarious. I believe that the music on this cd appeals to nearly all age ranges. This is not music that only one person in the family will listen to and enjoy. My entire family loves the cd. The only people who might not enjoy the music on this soundtrack are young children. There is the occasional ""four letter"" word, but nothing that bad. Once again, I think that this is a wonderful cd to purchase!"
3,Well recorded. Title track is great.,"Same genre as New Rider of the Purple Sage, Marshall Tucker. Not as accomplished as Alman Bros or Skynrd.This album is so well recorded. Actually, I have the Quadrophonic LP, and that usually means great time and expense were put into this recording. And you can hear it.Its a bit 'hokey' and 'twangy' and 'cheesy'. The title track excels. Cover art is nice.If you like Marshall Tucker stuff, this may appeal to you. Its certainly not currently (year 2000) fashionable stuff.Urban city slickers just cant dig this stuff. Very not funky.Usefull to clash with a neighboors relentless groovy funky recycled garbage music in an all out STEREO WAR!!"
2,The Chop Shop,"Very simply, it's Fripp's most interesting album and the one in my collection that makes my hair stand on end. But in the process of transferring it to CD, it was butchered. There is a full minute and a half on music missing from the album, as well as Fripp's acerbic wit on some of the songs (esp. Haaden Two) and the most fasceted instrument lines were also eliminated from the album, like the missing echo from ""here comes the flood"", the synthesizer line from ""NY3"" and ""Chicago"". In the end it was given the same rotten treatment that they gave to Fleetwood Mac's ""Tusk"", an equally diverse and experimental album. Both CD's should be avoided like the plague. My best advice is just to get an LP Player and enjoy the vinyl."
3,Peter Hammill [...] big time!,"I'm not sure that this 'two versions' of the same work is worth upgrading to. If you have the original cd maybe because of the sound enhancement it would be worth it. But if you are buying it to hear how some songs sounded when originally they were (must of the songs) sang by Philly singer Hall of Hall & Oates, then you might be dissapointed at how terrible he sounds compared to Hammill (the final choice in at least 4 songs).Peter Hammill saved the day in those songs and who ever chose him made a wise decision."
4,Exposure to a solid album,"Robert Fripp is best known as the pillar of ""King Crimson"" but has performed with countless artist. He is a true musicians musician. Exposure was Fripp's experience living in New York in the late '70s. Darryl Hall sings on several tracks.(Very different than most of his work) This album is said to be the begining of a whole different genre of music. I say that's true. It's a mix of ambient, hard rock, and experimental. If you want something that is revolutionary for your collection, give it a try."
4,Small difference before vs. after,"Solid and often overlooked work from Fripp. The remixed version is not so vastly different from the original to support reissuance, but is worth a listen for hard core KC and Frippmaniacs, only. Philly Soul meets Frippertronics."
4,You can listen to Robert Fripp for years...,"...BR>...and still not get his number. This is King Crimson's leader the way you'd expect him to sound in a solo effort. He throws you a few curves like the punkish ""You Burn Me Up, I'm a Cigarette"" or the micro-play ""NY3"" involving a dysfunctional family screaming at each other over a hardcore soundtrack, he comes across pedantic and pompous in liner notes he writes for himself--but then he goes and completely turns a whole track of this album over to another artist. The two-part ""Water Music"" is a ""frippertronics"" composition, but the song it brackets, ""Here Comes the Flood"", is all Peter Gabriel on voice and solo piano, which doesn't appear in that form on any of Gabriel's own albums until the ""Shaking the Tree"" anthology. So ""arrogant"" obviously isn't really the right word for Robert Fripp. Go figure."
4,Robert Fripp,"As a teen found Robert Fripp's music so fascinating.Still remember them and they are good to listen to , but different , maybe a little weird to.You Burn Me Up I'm a Cigarette is a fast paced good song. Disengage was mesmerizing to me as a teen and Mary was kind of soft and sweet as a love song."
4,Great cd -- idiotic liner notes,"Terrific album. Darryl Hall's vocal's are terrific. Remastered 24 bit recording sounds great if you listen to it on a decent stereo. The liner notes are so pretentiously idiotic and self-important though. I assume it is a goof (a la Metal Machine Music); if he is serious, he has a slightly inflated view of his role in the Cosmos."
5,Fast,"ordered Monday, received Friday. Now that's fast. And CD in great shape. It was advertised as ""played once"" but you can be skeptical of such claims. However, the disc looked new. Thanks!"

2,Nope did nothing for me...,"Did a lot of eye rolling here, and the ending was unbeliveable. I like a story that can draw me in and but for the most part most of the character here acted like teenagers not adults.If the premise of the story sounds great to you then read ""Undressing Mercy"" now that is a great story that really makes art erotic."
1,Handle covers are too small for most pans,These handles will only slide over your metal pan handle if the handle is as thin and narrow as a butter knife. Nowhere in the description of these silicone handles does it say these are to be used specifically with the French pan set they sell. Very disappointed....
3,A Little Dark,"The collection is ok, not as funny as I remembered, though the last time I saw them was 20 something years ago. The darkness of the picture (sometimes) was another thing. I don't know - maybe all the Little Rascal b&w; versions are like this.Also, seemed like there'd been cropping (?) - some of the letters in the opening titles, for example, are not visible.On the other hand, for the price you can't complain too much. I don't know if these 6 shows are the ""best"" of the Little Rascals, or if they represent the same quality you'd find in larger collections, but it may be worth picking up something like this before spending more on a larger collection. Also, after watching these episodes I started thinking I should have bought the technicolor version (bright!)."
5,Our Gang--Little Rascals Greatest Hits,"My eight year old LOVES this tape...he watches it over and over again...I would recommend this for anyone, young and old..I love the tape also...Thank you"
1,No attachment hardware,It's a pain to have to finish someone elses job. I now have to go get hardware so I can use. This on top of the double ship on my last order has been the breaking point.
3,Nice Product Slow Shipping,Product nice has held up so far. Shipping was very slow from company took over 2 weeks from time shipped to time getting
4,Good buy for the price,"I have taken my boat out about 10 times since using this product, and it has held up thus far. Very easy to install. The support poles seem a bit flimsy, but have held up my bimini top without bending/breaking while cruising at 40 mph on the water and at over 60 mph while trailering the boat. The base that attaches the poles to the boat is plastic, so warn passengers against using the poles for support, or the base will probably break. Overall, very satisfied."
3,mpmp,"book ok, not easy to use ... pictures in back and have to refer back and forth. pictures are ok, but not real good for many of the species. picture from bad angles and colors off, reflections, etc. better books.... Dragonflies and Damselflies of the East by Paulson. Damselflies of the Northeast by Lam. much easier to use. mpmp"
5,This book is very good.,"I have had Dunkle as a college professor, and his books are as good as his teaching. This book is a must if you love dragonflies. The book shows that a lot of work was involved, and it is a masterpiece which shows the many species of dragonflies. I am definitely looking forward to Dr. Dunkle's next masterpiece."
2,Frustration in the Field....,"Does not merit ""thru binoculars"" status in my experience. A real frustration in the field - attempts to make it ""work"" as a true field guide only had me reaching for the aspirin at days end. The species descriptions are obviously written with a specimen, countless images, and hours of experience in hand (Note no binoculars in aforementioned). One is provided with similar species to consider, yet the key comparitive marks again read like a lab description. I am challenged to find much that is helpful to a reasonably competent fieldperson who has no problem IDing a respectable number of birds, butterflies, flowers etc he comes across. Better than nothing, but not by much.For California, Manolis' excellent book is highly recommended, AND , it includes damselflies !"
4,Dragonflies Through Binoculars,Excellent guide to the Dragonflies of North America. Clear range maps and nice descriptions cover each species.The only negative about the book is the photographs for identification. The details on the dragonflies aren't easily seen since the photographs are taken at different angles which makes it more challenging to pick out the defining differences between the species.
1,Useless Without Pictures,"While I will not discuss the merits of this book, I will make a comment regarding the fact that the Kindle edition DOES NOT INCLUDE any photos, nor does the description warn buyers of this fact. I wish there was a way to get my money back, and I wish Amazon would be better about providing this type of detail."
3,User friendly,It is a joy to find an easy to use book to identify dragonflies. Especially after I photograph them. Dragonflies are an amazing little insect that are super abundant in the wetlands I visit.
3,Dragonflies Through Binocular (Almost),"This book was eagerly awaited by legions of dragonfly watchers, and Dragonflies Through Binoculars by Sid Dunkle is an good addition to the tools we need to help us identify the many dragonflies in North America. HOWEVER, the PUBLISHER has done many a reader a disservice by putting the idea into people's heads that with this book, a person can ID a dragonfly with binoculars. Even the more advanced Odonatist would have a hard time using the photos in the book to ID specimens in the field. For many species, you have to look at male genitalia, and of course, they are not shown close-up in the book. Furthermore, the photos are too small to show the pertinent features discussed in the text.Pluses: Good synopsis of natural history, range mapsMinuses: photos too small, no keys, no close-up details of pertinent features, some species not shown.Overall, even with its faults, this IS a useful book and if you are interested at all in dragonflies, go ahead and buy it."
3,somewhat of a disappointment,"I have taken this book on a dozen field trips, and it is extremely difficult to use. The pictures are photographs, untouched and any many cases unclear against a poor background. The only good thing about the book is that it is better than nothing. Just a little.Another minus about this book. If you get the pages wet they stick together and will not come apart once dry. A very bad trait for a field guide."
5,Gorgeous alternative baby book,Get this for any artists or musicians you know who are having a baby. The book has a poetic tone and lots of space for writing in comments far more personal and sweet than the typical height/weight/tooth stuff. Beautiful!
5,"Such a beautiful book--love using it as a mom, love giving it as a gift","Gorgeous illustrations and perfect pacing make a beautiful place to scrawl down the moments and memories you'd never have time or energy to record otherwise. I look forward to writing in my 15-month-old's book every month. I got it as a gift, and now I give it as a gift---truly a great reward for the wild ride of parenting. I hope someday my daughter will treasure it, but for now, it's a journal of love and development."
2,Very little for the money,I was very disapointed by this product. I felt the paper-size of the book was too small to enter all the things it requested and the paper appeared and felt cheap.The topics it suggested that you keep track of seemed good.
3,Cute but...,"Cute book and I love the art! I just wish it was a bit bigger, not enough room to write what needs to be said"
5,not your usual baby journal,not your usual baby book. but that's why I love it! I was looking for something different and more meaningful. this book is perfect. with entries like...how we welcomed you into this world...and our hopes and dreams for you...I enjoy writing in it and love the art as well.
5,wonderful,Someone gave me this gift and I have bought at least 5 books for people who are expecting. It is a wonderful beautiful book for new moms.
5,Waking Up....,"Yep,that's right,the Mayflower has landed,and its passengers are slowly starting to come out of hibernation.What they find is startling,the ship has landed in a strange world,half is black-and-white like an old photograph,and the other half is like an impressionest painting!the clock says they have been in space about 500 years!Over half of the passengers are dead,some missing...some people are still the same,others have been changed dramatically........I can't get enough!Once you read the first book with the rock and all that,you get excited about whats going to happen,and a lot does!There are no boring places in theese books,just places to catch your breath!I can't recomend theese books enough,although some younger kids might get frightened,anyone can enjoy theese books,even adults!So if you like a great sci-fi book,or kids and teen books,or if you just like a good read try theese books,I garentee you will not regret it!Hope this helped!"
2,very bad support services from Gateway,I bought a similar computer to this one and have had problems with the keyboard functioning intermittently. I returned the first one I bought and was given another but the problem exists with this one too. I called Gateway on the first one and was told that they could send me a box and it would take 3 to 4 weeks to fix or I could go to the store and buy a new keyboard at my expense! When I complained about that the tech said he could no longer talk to me if I refused to except those options for a computer I had 1 day! and he hung up on me. The web site for support is useless also. I will never buy another gateway product. Do yourself a favor and buy and HP or a Sony I have owned both and wish I had bought another instead of this.
2,Insta-Book,"As I read this and realized what talent Greenberg has, I couldn't help but wish she'd waited a few years to publish a book. There are glimmers of genuine inventiveness here, but too many of these poems are weighted down by the baggage of a kind of currently hip easy and breezy pseudo-experimental gimmickry. Cutsey little typographic tricks (i.e. crossouts, dashes, slashes and scissor-shaped word-art), studied ironies cleverly juxtaposed against the mock-naive, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. When are the crowd publishing in places like Verse and Volt going to realize that its complacency, not experimentation, when your poems all look and sound exactly the same? Greenberg's good, but she still has to filter her own voice from the fashionable clamor of her influences."
5,Given Over!,"These poems are daring, playful. Delights to the eye and ear. The variety of form, the voice(s) and play present in each poem makes for a thrilling journey. This collection does not tread lightly and directly as first books so often do. It tears through, it juggles, it incises & surmises the way that children do--without forsaking fun for intellect. I've rarely been so excited by a book. (And it's visually beautiful to boot.)"
1,cruddy at home edition,wont play on most cd players...this is some kind of at home operation that probably wont work for you. I bought it for Sound of San Fran by Global Deejays...sent back...got another...same issue.lame!
1,One word: Horrible!,"There's supposed to be one thing about a game that's the most important to me: How long you keep playing it. For me, I only played for three days, and got bored of it! At least it only costed [..] bucks...Cons:1. There is no creativity, and you have a very small selection of what to put in your mall.2. You can't really decide where to put a store.3. The items are so, so, expensive! I wasted 30,000 bucks in just 10 minutes, and was very dissatisfied, so I kept making new games over and over again, but each one turned out really disorganized.4. The symbols for each item a person's wants is so confusing! Example, the color red is for ""sports"" and the color blue is for ""food.""5. You lose business easily.I only bought this game because I once played Roller Coaster Tycoon 2, and I really liked it, but I found out Mall of America Tycoon was nothing like it, not even close!"
3,mall,"There is no real excitement in this game. It can be fun, but it is not very exciting and lacks unexpected problems popping up that make the game special It can keep you entertained for a while, but it does not keep the adrenaline pumping"
1,Didn't even work,"This game didn't even work out of the box.I'm glad, because I don't have to put up with what everyone else had.I guess I had a little fun trying to make this work, but no use."
1,Quite Disappointed,"No manual included. No manual on CD either. There's not a variety of merchants (stores) available to ""build"" your mall, or if there is I don't know how to get a variety. Even after building a few stores, the same merchants kept appearing so you end up putting 4 music stores on the same section/floor of the mall. That doesn't make sense. You also cannot rotate the screen to see all angles of the mall, or at least I haven't figured out how to if you could because there was no manual. The CD insert shows how to install the game manually, has an overview of the game and a small paragraph about gameplay and a few shortcuts how to get around the mall. That's not enough explanation of the game. The tutorial also does not help. Very disappointed."
1,I wish I could give this zero stars,"I made the mistake of buying this for my 9 year old daughter who LOVES Zoo Tycoon, thinking it would be similar. Someone must have sold (or stolen) the Tycoon trademark, because MOA is difficult to use -- it is not intuitive, and I cannot figure out how to fix mistakes (so there are trash cans all over the place and the stores won't land anywhere....)."
3,Entertaining but lack in coherence,"Fun to watch and some nice shots, but does not really tell you what to see or visit in Mexico. I am going there next month, and if like me you are looking for ideas as to what to visit, then this may not be your best choice."
2,Shallow Gal,"Tender Murderers &#65533; Women who kill by Trina Robbins is a puff piece. Twenty error filled chapters written with a wink and a nudge. Robbins couldn&#65533;t of picked easier murderers to write about and they have all been written about before with more detail. Her section on Dorothea Puente, the Sacramento rooming house murderer was almost fiction. She also left out tons of information on the Benders. This book is fine if you are a novice, but anyone who has read Bloodletters and Badmen by Jay Robert Nash will know more about any of the criminals than what Robbins wrote in this book."
2,Meter broke after used 5 times,"I purchased the item at Auto Supermarket about 8 months ago. After just at few times used, the meter stopped working. I paid about $115 for it. Not happy at all. Manufacturer offers two year warranty, but I have to ship it back to them (IT IS VERY HEAVY) and then they replace it with a refurbised one - not a new one. Stinks, after how much I paid for it."
1,Poorly Made,Went through two of these within one month. Overcharges batteries and then self-destructs. Poorly made.......
1,NOT HAPPY,"Bought my first one several years ago and got to use it 4 times before it died. Auto Zone kindly allowed me to exchange it. The new one was used the day I got it and went to use it again about 2 months ago and got it out of its box and guess what, that's right. Not working. Pleased? I don't think so. It is the Schumacher model se-2151MA SPORTS POWER. Where's the power?"
3,A story to visit WWI history.,"The actors were better than the plot or vice-versa. I'll keep it in my library, and probably will see it again."
3,Three Comrades,"The movie was fine, I kind of knew what to expct, being I read most of the book already by Remarque, a great writer, I guess I expected more from the movie, but all in all it was fine."
4,Intriguing and sad,I watched this movie based on a friend's recommendation as well as the fact it had Javier Bardem. He did an excellent job too. Its not your tourist bureau picture of Barcelona for sure. And there's enough little mysteries going on to provide plenty of post film discussion over a cup of coffee and dessert. But it is sad and dire. Be prepared to be in the right frame of mind to take in this film.
1,Disappointed,"The most depressing film I have ever seen and I have seen a lot. Unrelentingly dismal. Although the performances are excellent, especially the lead's, this does not a good film make. Warning: it might forever change your image of party-hardy, trendy Barcelona."
1,D for depressing,"If you like depressing stories about smugglers with terminal illness, druggy X, bad situation and bad scenery. This is for you- just not my taste."
3,Very depressing...,"This film was worth sitting through but I would not want to own it or sit through it again, too depressing."
3,DOES NOT MAGNIFY!!,"The product description implies that this telescope magnifies: ""See the stars; get an up-close look at everything"". Although I wouldn't expect much magnification for this price, it would have been easy for them to do since the telescope does actually have lenses. My kids have little binoculars that provide 5x or 10X magnification for under $10, so it's a shame this doesn't do the same. If you just want it for pretend play, then it would be fine, but then why did they put lenses on it in the first place?"
4,Pretty good movie made for tv,"I remembered seeing this little flick on the tube when it came out. Features George Kennedy with the annoying kid from the movie Ben. Somewhat predictable plot and obviously made for tv, but still decent entertainment for 90 minutes."
2,Montana Decoy,Item was extremely difficult to fold properly and one leg of decoy was missing fitted material in which to put hard support for attachment into ground.
4,Macfadden's Best,"I'm glad to see this book by the ""father of physical culture"" back in print. It is truly a classic and by far the best and most useful of Macfadden's numerous books. This book mainly covers exercises for developing vitality (physical well-being and energy), but also has some good information about diet, correct breathing, fresh air, preserving the teeth, curing constipation, blood purifucation, bathing, clothing, sleep, etc. It covers a wide range of health subjects. Bernarr Macfadden (1868-1955), America's first ""health guru"" was definitely ahead of his time. This book presents many of his theories in a clear and readable format. The style of writing is definitely dated, but his message is clear. The photographs are numerous and excellent."
5,The Father Of Physical Culture,"It is great to see 2 of my favorite books back in print.""Vitality Supreme"" and ""Muscular Power And Beauty"" both by Bernarr MacFadden was one of the greatest innovators in the field of physical culture. His magazine""Physical Culture"" was the dominant publication in the field in the early 1900s. The 2 previously mentioned books introduced the public to resistance exercise which was later hyped as Dynamic Tension by Charles Atlas who had been named ""The World's Most Perfectly Developed Man"" in a contest sponsored by MacFadden and made popular by ads run in MacFadden's ""Physical Culture Magazine."" He also sponsored perfect woman competitions and promoted healthy living in numerous ways. Great Books!"
5,10 out of 10 spacerock,"well this is it,how can i explain this, i bought this album plus there other double CD at the same time. went home and listened to both these two cds for at least 3 weeks straight. feedback . drone , spaced out drums all over the place. cymbals crashing , melodic bass distortions. i tell ya this is how space rock is ment to be. 11 out of 10"
3,An interesting concept,"The American philosopher of evolutionary adaptability Alois P. Swoboda said ""All evolution is a reaction to stress"" and life experience has made me realize that this is as true in mental and emotional activites as it is in physical ones.If you read biographies of famous people you will find that overcoming barriers made the difference in many of their lives. In fact, psychologist Alfred Adler based much of his theory on great people who had become that way by overcoming inferiority complexes."
4,Children of the Nazi Germany,Number the Stars is the book I read. I think the book has a lot of cliffhangers that will keep you on the edge of your seat.It will keep you thinking and wonting more.There is a lot of good things in the middle of the book but i think at the end of the book it gets boring.Over all i think Number the Stars is good book i give it 4 stars.
4,Number the Stars,"Ten-year old Annemarie Johansen and her family fights for their Jewish friends survival during the Nazi occupation in Denmark during World War II. Prewarned that the Nazi's intended to relocate the Jews, the Johansen family take in Ellen while her parents hide elsewhere. Posing as another daughter, they visit Uncle Henrik at his home near the sea. Courageously, the family smuggles Ellen and her family out of the country. Overall this is an interesting book however, it is geared towards a younger audience."
5,Number the Stars,"This book called Number the Stars by Lois Lowry is a great book for any person who likes action. It tells a lot about what happened in World War II, and what the Jews had to go through.So, it starts in Denmark where Annemarie, her friend Ellen, and her little sister Kristi, walk home from school like it was any other day, but then they got stopped by two German soldiers. Later they find out that Ellen has to stay with the Johnanson's for a while. One night the Nazis almost find out that Ellen is Jewish.Then they go to Annemarie's uncle's house, Annemarie finds out many truths in all that's going on with the war, and is sent on a small but dangerous mission.Will Annemarie help Ellen and her family escape from the German soldiers? And, will Annemarie complete the mission that she was sent on? If you liked the story and you want to find out what happens, then you have to read the book to find out the answers. I personally liked the book and would give it five starsNaomi C. age 11."
5,How sad,"I read this and it is a vary sad story about the jews in world war 2 but not in teh camps but in hiding. I also reamand "" teh dairy of ann frank"" that is vary sad too"
5,This is a very good book and I recommend that it is read.,"The way this book touches the heart of so many readers is phenomenal. The two girls that are in this story go through many hardships together, as one of them is a Jew in Nazi Denmark during World War 2. The young girl is very brave, somewhat mature about her situation. The daring escapes and the manipulation of the Nazi army makes this book very exciting to read. I recommend this to everyone to read."
4,Zapnes' Crew talks about Number the Stars,"This book is about courage and bravery for Annemarie and Ellen during World War II when German Nazis invade and occupy Denmark, along with other European countries. The two families, the Rosens and the Johansens, are involved in a journey that many took to help Jews in Denmark to safety. We recommend this historical fiction to people who want to learn about WW II and read about the struggle of the Jews and Danes that lived in Denmark during the war. It's a heart-breaking story about love and danger."
5,Casey's Critique,"I think that Number the Stars is an amazing book. It's about ten-year old Annemarie Johansen and her best friend Ellen Rosen. All they want to do is to have fun and play together. But, they can't. The Nazis marching all over town searching for Jews. Ellen and her family must be ""relocated"" and fast. Her family must leave Ellen in the care of AnneMarie and her family, in order to hide themselves. Ellen has done a great many things for AnneMarie and her family. Can they repay her by keeping her safe? This book is wonderful. It will keep you reading with page-turning suspense. If I rated this book from 1 to 5, I would give it a 5, because once you start reading it, you'll never put it down until you've finished it! And you'll always pick it up to read it again!"
3,Stars.....,"This book is about a girl who has to face many things involving her to be brave. The setting is in Copanhagen Denmark during WWII. I would recommend this book to children 12 and under for it is a very easy read. Although, it is a very good book.So read it!"
5,A Touching Classic,"Number the Stars should be on every book shelf of the schools in America and other International Countries. AnneMarie's fight through the terrorizing Nazi regime in Copenhagen during Hitler's Era is a major part of American History, that every child should be informed of. If any child has gone past the age of twelve without reading this book, I reccomend they read it. It is a book that is hard to put down, and you will spend hours currled up on the sofa reading it. I read this book for a school assignment in the fifth grade, and saw it as an American Classic. Ms. Lowry outdid herself with this one, in my opinion."
4,...Review,"The book is good. I hope Lois Lowry's books are all as good as this one. When I started to read it, it was hard to stop. This is the best book I have every read. I think Annamarie was the best character in this book. I really enjoyed reading this book at (local) Elementary School."
4,Number The Stars,"The book Number The Stars was very good.It's about two girls.One of their names are Ellen Rosen,she's a ten year-old that is Jewish.The other one is Annemarie Johansen.The both girls are best friends.But they're going through a war.There are men that are called soldiersand the soldiers are taking all the jewish people.I would reccomand this book because once you start reading you can't put the book down."
4,"Absorbing, frank, and serious -- all all the same time","Lowry does an excellent job at absorbing the reader immediately into a story that it full of emotion and frankness. The characters are fairly believable, albeit one-dimensional. The metaphors are obvious, but enough so that most children will detect them. The text deals with the Danish Resistance, a subject that has only recently gotten the notoriety it deserves. Readers wonder along with Annemarie whether they could be heroes if such dire situations presented themselves."
2,NTS Review,"Number the Stars is about a Danish family and their Jewish friends during World War II and their struggles with the Nazi dictatorship.I didn't like this novel so much due to the lack of action. I'm more of a fan of fast-paced thriller novels. This book seemed to avoid the gory aspects of the war, which many people seem to appreciate. It was an informative story on how things were like for victims of the Nazis. It focused more on emotions and their test on the people threatened by Nazi dictatorship.I didn't enjoy this book, but would recommend it to other novelists who can enjoy reading books with less action than I'm used to."
3,DIDNT READ IT,"I have no idea what this book is about, but it must mean something since it was recommended for my son who is in Middle school as ""recommeneded reading""."
1,really bad,"this book is 1 ihad to read, &i hated it! the caracters and plot were soooooo boring. seriously, dont read it. :("
5,This is a great adventure story,"Interesting from the beginning, lot's of danger and risk taking. I have only had it 2 weeks and I am reading it a second time. The story gets better every time."
5,This is the measure that should be used for a Newbery winner!,"This 1990 Newbery Medal award-winning book is stunningly powerful. The title is taken fromPsalm 147""The Lord is rebuilding Jerusalem;he gathers in the scattered sons of Israel.It is he who heals the broken in spiritand binds up their wounds,he who numbers the stars one by one""The setting is 1943 and Nazi occupied Denmark where, while there is a shortage of food, heat and clothing, there is no shortage of fear and terror wrought by the invasive German soldiers.Using the historical backdrop of the bravery, courage and sense of moral imperatives demonstrated by the Danish people which resulted in saving the lives of at least 7,000 - 8,000 Jews, Lowry provides a story strong in character, fortitude and resistance.Highly recommended!!!"
4,Review about Number the Stars,"This is a book about Annemarie, a girl who has a Jewish friend. The two girls live in the time that the Nazi soldiers are trying to kill Jewish people. Ellen, Annemarie's friend, goes to live with Annemarie while her parents are being relocated. This is a good book with a great ending. I reccomend it for 3rd and 4th graders. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because it got a little confusing and boring at the end. I hope you read Number the Stars."
4,Number the 4 stars I rated it,"I heard about this book on PBS and when I started to read it, I remembered hearing the story of the Danes during WWII at the National Holocaust Museum. The story is indeed inspiring and a wonderful tool to expose children to the horrors of the holocaust without being traumatic. For a Newberry Award winner, I was a little disappointed: I was just getting into the story when it abruptly ended, skipped a couple of years to the end of the war, and summarized the ""happy"" ending. I would have preferred to have more detail of Annemarie's experiences during the occupation. (Also, the younger sister was too ""cutsy"" and very annoying.) However, on the whole, this is one of the best children's fiction books on World War II in Europe, second only to ""Journey Through the Night"" by Anne De Vries relating the Dutch experience."
3,"An okay book, not too great, a good account of the Holocaust","I mean, I think I read this book expecting too much of the author because I had loved her Giver book, and I thought that this book would have the same sort of magic in it. But no. The story doen't tell much at all. I felt a loss at the end because I wanted to know more, and in more detail. No offense, this book was a pretty sinple plain book. The only reason people may like it (in my opinion) is that it has a touching plot."
4,I thought that the book was great.,"I give,Number the Stars,four stars. I liked the way the author used some facts about the war, but summed it into a story. Another thing I liked about the book was the resistance. That is cool how those poeple worked so hard. They gave their lives sometimes to stop Hitler from distroying Denmark and other countries. I recommend this book to someone that is intrested in wwII and wants to read.You learn alot of things about the war you didn`t know. It made me cry sometimes and mad sometimes. Hitler was such a bad man. I hope something like that never happens again."
3,It was ok.....,"I read this book in my class and I thought it was boring, but it did have a good plot. The author could have made it longer and more descriptive. Ellen was in danger but Lois didn't make you feel that. And Annemarie wasn't acting like she was scared for Ellen, even though I know she was. Lois' book The Giver was a great book, I thought, but not Number The Stars. I also read A Summer To Die. I thought that was great! But anyway Number The Stars wasn't what it was cut out to be."
5,A very interesting book......,"I loved the book, Iit could happen in real life. The book is about a girl [Anamarie] and her best friend. [Ellen] The story takes place in Copenhagen during world war two. Ellen is jewish, Anamarie is not, and like the Jews of Denmark were being relocated, then somehow Ellen and her family must escape to a place were they wont be taken away....."
5,A very good book,"My Language class in school is currently reading this book. It's about a 10-year-old girl named Annemarie Johanson, and her Jewish friend Ellen Rosen who are both growing up in World War II, 1943. The Nazis are sent by there leader Hitler to kill all those who are Jewish. Annemarie and her family protect Ellen and her family from the Nazis. This book is very good. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical-fiction. :)"
5,Number the Stars,"Number the stars by Lois Lowery is a book full of adventure and excitment. I liked this book because Annamarie Johannsen (the main girl) goes on a life-threatning ""mission."" My favorite charactor is Annamarie Johannsen because she puts herself out there without thinking of herself or the dangers. My single favorite moment is when Annamarie is stopped by four police men and is asked to open her basket. To her surprise she finds out whats in the bottom of her basket. So if you like adventure and excitment then this is the book for you!!!"
5,"Overall, this book is a masterpiece from top to bottom.","This book is a wonderful thing for people,not just young adults, but of all ages. It teaches all about the challenges people have to face when there's a war and not just the soldiers have to face them. In this book one family, like many other families worked to halp their friends the Rosens from a horrible death. this novel is so dramatical is will make you cry picturing the lifelike images in your mind. The only thing about this book that is bad is the fact that it was written about something that really happened in our civilized world."
3,number the Stars,"Hi my name is Matthew. I read the book Number the Stars, I only gave it three stars because to me it is not very intresting . But if you want to read it go ahead and read it you'll probaly agree with me."
3,Not a Eye Catcher,"This book was a well written book and the book had a lot of information, but the book did not catch my eye. The book was not as fufilling as I hoped. Sometimes the book carried on something but other wise it was a good book."
3,O.k.,"Number the Stars was a book of worries , emotions, and sadness. Number the Stars taught me more about the Nazi and what the Nazi did to Jewish people and the people that helped the Jews to excaped. But with this sorrow this book also has happiness and joy. I reconmand this book for you. I hope u read this book."
2,useless Anne Frank imitation,"I read this book in the second grade, and again as it was assigned in the 5th grade. It was full of over used metaphors and shallow characters. Number the Stars is an example of writing on a popular subject, and getting popular in school because it's easy and not too violent. I could name you 10 holocaust books that are much better than this one."
5,A wonderful introduction to generally difficult material,"Introducing children to the study of the Holocaust can be a difficult task, but Lois Lowry's book lends itself as a perfect way to do this. The story's happy ending does not diminish the fact that it teaches many of the important lessons young children can gain from the study of the Holocaust. It is a book that will prepare young readers to read books such as The Diary of Anne Frank and others in the future."
3,Awesome,I I loved this book it is soooo applicable and fun to read I think all of you will love this book!!!
2,not the best,"i did not want to read it at all but i had to for school. i did not like it, it was confusing"
5,Number the Stars is a must read!,When I looked at the front cover of the book I thought that it would be a boring book but I was wrong. Right away I was on the edge of my seat. Lowry started it when two best friends were trying to make the best of every day even though World War two was going on. Then the Germans were trying to take all of the Jews away and relocate them which that was her best friend Ellen Rosen. Annemarie is asked to be as brave as she has ever been in her life when it comes to the Nazi soldiers. Annemarie Johansen and Ellen Rosen go on a wild journey to save Ellen's family and many other Jewish people. Louis Lowry told about a breath taking story of friendship and bravery between two best friends. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes exciting and adventurous books.
5,Fantastic read,This book is as close to real life events as could possibly be. The characters and stories they tell are told with such depth that you just want to continue reading. This is a must read and one for keeps.
5,Number the Stars,I would rate the book number the stars a five because it is a book that really keeps your attention the whole time. It is amazing how you can see what some of the jews went though. I love the whole book but I think the ending could be changed.You should still read the book anyway.
4,number the stars,This is all about what I thought of the book. I think it is really good. It was wierd that they stood at all of the street corners. I thought that they were going to see the Star of David imprinted on Annemarie's hand. That is what I thought of this amazing and entertaing book.
4,number the stars,one of the best books ive ever read it really shows an understanding of what it would have been like all the charecters are all very lovable especially little kristie.
4,Number the Stars,"Number the Stars... Four Stars: A great novel about World War II.This is a great book. It is about a girl called Ana Marie who lives during the time of World War II. Her best friend Ellen is Jewish, and Ellen and her family have to get away from the Nazi Soldiers. Ellen's parents go into hiding with the help of Ana Marie's parents, but Ellen stays with Ana Marie and they pretend that they are sisters. The only problem is that the Nazis know that Ana Marie's parents are friends with Ellen's parents and they come to their apartment and accuse them of hiding Ellen's family.In this book the vocabulary was somewhat difficult, but I would still recommend this book to other students. Ana Marie was a very important character in the book. She saved Ellen's life numerous times in this book, and without her this story won't make any sense. This is a really exciting and adventurous book, and I would definitely recommend this book to other people who like adventure."
3,Not Moving,"Although my favorite genre is historical fiction, this book just didn't do it for me. I wasn't greatly moved and I didn't feel really sad or compassionate. This novel is short and sweet, informative, not boring, and well put together. The only thing is that it doesn't make you feel the way the characters do, or change your perspective on things. I reccomend to anyone who enjoys reading about the holocaust. I did enjoy reading it, but it wasn't fanominal. The plot was almost unbelievable. It is a little juvenile for older kids, who can move on to more sophisticated Holocaust books. I read it just befor going to the Holocaust museum in Washington, DC and found that having background knowledge is very useful when going there. Overall, good and informative; not breath taking."
3,Good in some ways...,"I read this book as a class-reading project during 5th grade. The way the book is written is quite impressive in itself. The story offers much history. It may offend you, however, if you're a Jew(I am not). Get the book if you want an interesting WWII novel read."
4,This is a great book to show kids about the holocaust.,This is a great book that teaches children many things about what happen and how it happened. Lois lowry makes them think about it and that it could have been them that this was happening too.
4,Annmarie has to help her friend so she does with courage.,I liked this book alot.It was really a great book because it was heartwarming and also had some humor in it. I especially liked it when they were at Aunt Birte's funeral and the guard came in. This was a great book and recommend it to anyone.
5,I believe this is the best book in the world!!!!!!!!!!!,"I would definitly recommend this book to anyone because it teaches people that they would never want something like this to ever happen again.It also lets them know how bad the Jews were treated.Ithought the way that Denmark helped their Jews was wonderful and brave.I hope every child gets a chance to read the GREAT book ""Number The Stars."""
1,Very Unsatisfied,I purchased and paid for this item over a month ago. I have not recieved it or heard anything.
3,Number The Stars,"Number The Stars is a very good book wrighten by Lois Lowry.This is a very good and interesting book about World War Two and what the German's did to the Jews, and how Hitles wanted to eliminate all Jews. German Solders are on every corner to watch and control everything the people would do. The book took place in Denmark. Some of the main characters are Annemarie Johansen, a ten year old girl, that is growing up at the time of the war in 1943.Annemarie's best friend was a Jew, the solders came to the room and ...... read Number The Stars by Lois Lowry to find out what happens."
3,This book was OK,"Not very good. Hardley any detail. I think I'm a little too old anyway.I feel like it was wasted time, but I gave it a 3 because any book that's ever been published deserves at least a 3.It was worth Accelerated Reader points though and I got the points.I would recommend this book to people that are into wars. I'm really not much into that kind of thing or I think I might have liked it!~ :)"

3,IT'S GGGRRREEEAAATTT!,I liked the book a lot.I would recommend it to people of all ages.I liked everything in it.The characters were very real.
5,Extremely Interesting,"This book was very interesting. I am a Jewish girl. I'm only 12, I read this book last year in school. I thought it was interesting to learn about what exactly happened during the Holocaust. I also felt it was interesting learning about what a life was like during the war. I mean, how the people snuck out of their country, out of their house because of the German soldiers. What made me mad was that Hitler was part Jewish, he was killing his own people! That's killing your heritage. If your up for adventure and want to learn about what life was like back then or about what the Jews went through, this is the book for you!"
4,number the stars,This book is great it is filled with excitement.There is a girl that lives in copenhagen.It has been invaded by the German Nazis.these germans are capturing Jewish people because of their religion.Annemarie's best friend and her parents are jewish.This book is great and I recommend this book because it is an excellent and sad story and I say to read this book.
