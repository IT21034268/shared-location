1,Lame,"I do agree that this novel was very well written.It has an interesting plot, intense characters, a very intelligent developement and sound arguments. I just could not see why Mr. Jonathan as a scientist wanted to obliterate the truth.I would like very much that someone would find Jesus' bones (and eventually, we will!) and end this religious hypocresy and finally contradict St Paul and his ridiculous epistles. Anyway I never thought that Jesus resurrected carrying all his bones with him. What for? P.S.(Is a good thing that Mr Maier doesn't write any romance novels)"
2,Interesting Premise but Weak Writing and Predictable Ending,"I really wanted to like this book. It was highly recommended to me by a close friend. I was fascinated by the premise of the book, but I found the writing to be weak and the ending was easily predictable less than half way through the short book."
5,better than its sequel,Thoroughly enjoyable. More so than it's sequel.A bit of rmance thrown in to spice it up.This would make a fun movie.
4,Thoughtful fiction!,"One occasionally disturbing romp of a tale! The author does a terrific job of touching on the fascinating archaeology that goes into the backgrounds of antiquity. This is fiction that deals honestly and intelligently with the serious study of the foundations of Christianity, not the deluded ""straw man"" of a Dan Brown."
2,Disappointing,"Anyone familiar with Rumi's Persian originals will find these translations deeply disappoinitng. Communicates only a fraction of Rumi's burningly intense and often complex pictorial language. Highly edited, lightweight and unnecessary."
3,Chopra's Rumi,"Nuances are everything when interpreting any writing. This book was disappointing in contrast to other interpretations of Rumi I have read. There was actually little of the passion of his writing. Poetry was all about words, and the translator or the editor or Dr. Chopra missed the mark. However, the book is lovely to look at, was in the condition described and the seller shipped it promptly. I recommend seller highly."
5,Perfect,"Rumi and Deepak, a union made in heaven:)Perfect little book of Rumi to give as a gift for a first glimpse into his world, beautiful."
4,A Rumi Bedside Companion,Trying to plow through all of Rumi's works can be overwhelming. How nice to have a tiny selection to keep by the bedside for inducing dreams of love!
5,RUMIRUMI R U M I,"Anyone who doesnt know Rumi . . . Introduce yourselfI have been listening to or reading Rumi for over 5 yeatrs now(and so has my 19 yo son)When I do so before bed . . . I sleep like a babyRumi is . . .. . . SPIRITUAL. . . INSPIRATIONAL. . . LOVE. . . THE MANRumi is the mystic and poet for ALL agesTry 'A Gift Of Love"" - Deepak Chopra . . . music to Rumis love poemsThis too is awesome"
2,Very disappointing,"The title of this book is misleading. Only one chapter in the entire book deals with hedged scale trading and to sum it up the author says...""buy puts"". Brilliant. The rest of the book describes scale trading (poorly) and fundamental analysis. If you want to learn about scale trading go to the source. Look at Robert Weist's, ""You Can't Loose Trading Commodities"". Weist does a much better job describing this trading technique. This book was a real disappointment and waste of money (in my opinion)."
1,i tossed mine in the trash,less than a week after buying this cable it went out. don't waste your money.
5,fine presentation,"I knew very little about the artist prior to viewing this DVD. The script is substantial, yet not burdensome, and helped me to appreciate the works presented. Images are crisp and plentiful. It's a keeper."
4,It Works,"I purchased this book because i bought it when it first came out and it works. I was fighting in tournaments and won many times but not until I started using the advice in this book it works it is a no nonsense approach to endurance training, how many books have you read that go on like someone who just keeps talking about nothing, this book doesn't it gets to the barebones about it and the exercises do work at least for fighting ie: karate, tae kwon do and mixed martial arts and i have the trophys to prove it."
5,Simply Beautiful,"Much more stripped down then her other releases, ""Earthbound"" lets Alice's song writing speak for itself. On the first listen you may not ""get it."" After a few more spins, the simplicity of the arrangements lets the lyrics and the melodies sink in. Very emotional, great for rainy days."
5,So I'm going to Bali,"I found the CD-ROM to be extremely informative in thinking about what to pack, what to expect in customs, where to eat, how to bargain and many more questions I had when considering a trip to Bali. I have actually used the information in this CD-ROM to prepare my ""Bali travel book"" that I can use as a quick reference while I'm there. It provides first hand practical information that most travel books do not, or would not include about how to travel on a budget. I would highly recommend this CD-ROM to anyone considering a trip to Bali."
4,Amusing fun for Who fans,"That description is true for about half the tracks, while the others may leave you scratching your head and go ""huh?""Featuring Doctor Who themed tracks from Jon Pertwee (the third Doctor), Frazer Hines (Jamie) and Roberta Tovey (Susan in the Dalek movies), as well as TV and movie themes. Then there are The Go-Go's ('I'm Gonna Spend My Christmas With A Dalek' - and no, not those GoGos) with a strange stocking stuffer, and then there is the 'Dance of the Daleks' which seems to have nothing to do with Daleks at all.If you are a Doctor Who fan and willing to go on a journey down the very strange byways that the show has generated, then give this a go!"
2,OK,"The music goes no where near fitting any sort of a feel the Dr. Who series usually embodied. Especially the orchestrated versions are extremely jumping and terribly goofy. It is OK, but hard to listen to more than once. The only really interesting novelty is the Jon Pertwee track."
2,Missing...,"There were 49 envelopes in the package.Seeing as it says there should be 50,and I needed them for a 50 CD-RW project, I was dissatisfied. I now have one cd without a case."
3,About right for low price,"These are OK, but I wish I'd spent a little more for heavier paper (assuming the ones costing more have that). Well made but light."
5,"Outstanding Player, Outstanding Music, Outstanding","I've been a Charlie Parker fan, almost since I started playing the alto sax in high school in the early 70's.Much of Parker's recorded work has been of substandard sound quality or released, then out of print. The Dial recordings, included here, were among those seminal recordings of Bird at his peak, but availability has been limited for years.This recording puts together in one compilation a number of his best recordings: Cool Blues, Bird's Nest, Ornithology, Parker's Mood, and much, much more. The application of 21st century recording techniques results in a package of sound quality that enhances, rather than detracts from the music.I recommend this to any fan of Bird, any fan of jazz and any saxophone player."
1,"I LOVE this set, HATE the price!","I AM VERY DISAPOINTED IN AMAZON. OVER 100 DOLLARS?! ARE YOU PEOPLE CRAZY?! IT'S ONLY GOT 20 SOME EPISODES! I PAYED ONLY 60 DOLLARS AT EBAY FOR AN ANIME SET WITH 70 EPISODES! WOW, DOES THAT SAY ALOT. I KNOW THE ECONEMY IS HARD, BUT OVER 100 DOLLARS IS CRAZY. WHAT A RIP OFF. IT IS NOT WORTH THAT MUCH. IT'S WORTH NO MORE THAN 30 DOLLARS SINCE IT'S ONLY HALF OF THE SEASON. I COME TO AMAZON SINCE YOU GUYS HAVE BETTER DEALS THAN PUBLIC STORES, BUT THIS IS INSANE! I love this season, and my sister was about to buy it for me this Christmas, but then you guys jacked it up insanely high to a price where NO ONE will buy it!"
4,Great only if you have the space for it,"I bought this organizer for my college dorm, and I can tell you that it is MASSIVE. I left it on my desk for two months, but then I had to put it underneath my bed because it was taking up too much space. The Safco brand is a very good one, and I would recommend their products. But make sure you can accommodate 20 inches of space width-wise before you buy this product."
5,nice organizer,"Helps to keep my husband's desk neatly organized. doesnt look cheap, matching with any interior, holds a lot of papers. both liked it!"
2,Better to Apply the Ten Dollars to Douglas' Book,"As the guinea pig, I am happy to report that this is an 8-page downloadable e-article that skims the surface, and that it would be better to apply your ten dollars to one of Mark Douglas' books."
3,"OK book, but focused on a very low intelligence audience.","I think that this book covers a lot of good material, but it is not geared toward an avid tester. Great book for those just trying to learn what a software tester must do with no prior experience, but avoid this one if you are experienced at any level with software testing."
1,You won't know to test after reading this!!,"You will not know to test after reading this. It's generic and gives a broad overview about the history of testing, but there are no practices of any sort. It doesn't cover different types of testing or even show you what a test case looks like. This maybe useful for non technical people to figure out what testing is, but if you are actually planing on testing, this book will better serve as a door stop.If you are planning on a career in the IT field, this is NOT the book for you."
1,"Ron Patton, improve your book instead of commenting on every review!","I would NOT recommend this book to anyone who really want to know about testing/ want to get into testing. There is not one iota of information about how to test. It's like a ""cookbook"" without a single recipe. It maybe good for managers to learn what testing is, but it's not practical at all.And Mr. Author, take these hints and improve your next book instead of getting defensive about every comment."
4,Book Contents,"The ""Search inside this book"" feature was not available for this book when this review was posted. Hope it helps.TABLE OF CONTENTS01 Software testing background02 The software development process03 The realities of software testing04 Examining the specification05 Testing the software with blinders on06 Examining the code07 Testing the software with X-ray glasses08 Configuration testing09 Compatibility testing10 Foreign-language testing11 Usability testing12 Testing the documentation13 Testing for software security14 Website testing15 Automated testing and test tools16 Bug bashes and beta testing17 Planning your test effort18 Writing and tracking test cases19 Reporting what you find20 Measuring your success21 Software quality assurance22 Your career as a software tester"
4,Solid Introductory Book,"Very good book that covers several other topics related to software testing: software testing documentation, bug tracking Quality Assurance, compatibility and internationalization testing, ...Contains many suggestions on areas that are error prone. I found the book and excellent introductory level book that exposes you to all the facets of software testing.I give four stars as I found the part on actual software testing rather light. White/Black box static/dynamic testing are each covered in a separate chapter. Would be ideally complemented by a reference document on actual software testing techniques."
2,A point to be noted.,"While the shipping response and everything was respectable, I was disappointed to find that the CD inserts were blurry, and after comparing them to my friend's official copy of the album, I am 90% sure that this was a bootleg CD."
2,I've seen better,"I've used other Falcon guides in Montana, and was very impressed. I admit I haven't fished in Yellowstone yet, and from the other reviews it looks like it's pretty useful.But from just a reading standpoint, it's not very good. The pictures are terrible, and I don't think there's a picture of a fish in the entire book, if you can believe that. Also, there needs to be an overall map of some kind, so you can figure out where in the park the little maps are. Even if the big map was split into quadrants spread out over several pages it would help alot. Check out ""Fishing the Beartooths"" - now that's a great book.Just my two cents worth."
5,Vintage my Foot!!!,"A little sociology lesson as you travel around with rick and buddy, drinking beer and breaking into backyards to ride some gems. Don't get the idea that this is vintage footage. shot and edited on super 8. This is the kind of thing that skaters dream about all day. Great footage of the greatest pool riders of modern times. Salba, Tony Farmer, OX, Royce Nelson and others. Don't get sucked in by the egoes of other films, there is no comparison for this movie."
3,It's all good...,"Not my favorite, but definitely entertaining. Does a good job of documenting pool skating out west."
3,Some problems,"I bought these for my Fein random orbit sander. The first 25 or so kept de-laminating, that is, the abrasive side kept coming loose from the velcro side, after just a few moments of use. Frustrating! Before I got around to contacting the company, I got a little deeper into the box, and I've had no problems since. These are not the same quality as those made by Fein - thinner and cheaper. But they are quite a bit less expensive, so you get what you pay for. Hopefully my delaminating experience is isolated. I also bought a heavier grit box and had no problems from those. All in all, I would still buy them even if I expected to lose 25 off the top, just because of the price."
5,Fun primer on some counterintuitive quantum phenomena,"A great reader on some ""unbelievable"" sounding physical phenomena, with a focus on quantum mechanics. It's quite intellectually satisfying to see the ""bizarre"" micro-level physics behind what we regard as everyday macro-level phenomena.Some math/science experience is probably a prudent prerequisite for appreciating this book, but it is certainly not necessary to be a physicist (nor even to know calculus) to understand most of the ideas presented here. It is maybe half a notch more technical than the average quantum mechanics article in Scientific American. It is certainly nowhere near the technical level of a physics journal article, nor even a college physics textbook."
5,A big help,The cleaning swab works very well in my .45 and is good for other cleaning jobs as well. The quality of this swab is good.
4,Wonderful fusion of traditional Indian music and rhythmicjaz,"I bought the CD by chance in a Warsaw jazzstore, misled by the title which in my mind suggested something precolumbian. What I heard instead was most amazing. I have simply never heard a better matched fusion between classical Indian music, expressed in very powerful both male and female voices, traditional instruments, but an especially strong rhythmic section (tabla's, etc..), and on the other hand, very convincing rhythmic jazz with keyboards, trumpets etc.. This is neither one or the another, but a new kind of powerful blend, not newagey at all, but nevertheless trance-inducing through its rhythms ... There's also an identifiable African percussion to be heard. I only give it a four, instead of five, because the documentation is very poor, apart from the names of its musicians, you get no background about the project, the musicians etc..."
1,Years worse book,"This book is so historically inaccurate and full of the most idiotic portrayals of Caesar, Octavian, Brutus, etc, etc that I have ever read. Take my advice and save your money. Conn is ignorant of factual history and it amazes me that so many people like his work!"
4,Emperor: The Gods of War,I have read the entire series and was delighted when the final book finally became available. This is the perfect book for those of us who like to read historic novels. The characters really come to life and have a very 'real' feeling.
3,Not originals,"Of course these are not the original recordings.The bulk of the tracks here are from the K-Tel re-recordings Pat Boone made in the early Seventies.I think ""Rip it up"" and ""Oh Boy"" may have been a seventies single and ""Mr Blue"" comes from the album ""All in the Boone Family"" again from the seventies.That,of course,doesn't mean this CD isn't enjoyable on its own terms."
2,Resolving the re-make issue,"To resolve the argument between the two previous reviewers, I found both this and the ""Original Dot Records Hit Recordings"" on iTunes. The versions of ""Ain't That a Shame"" are clearly different (iTunes samples both versions in the same area). Given that, at least some of the items here are re-recordings. But even the re-recording of ""Tutti Frutti"" shows why the original was left off the Dot package - it is an utter embarrassment that shows the worst side of the 50's trend for white artists to ""sanitize"" black records. Still, this is the only place to get anything like the period recordings of ""Tutti Frutti"" and ""Rip it Up"" (the re-recordings were made in the early 60's - only a few years after the originals, and before the embarrassment set in)."
1,Not the Originals,These are not the original hit recordings. Very disappointing although the cheap price should have been a clue to the fact that this was another rip-off.
4,Awsome concert and extras!,"The concert portion of this package is a great show of the beard. Yes, the sound could be better. Besides the sound (which isn't all that bad), this is the beard at their progressive best. The musicianship that shines through is breathtaking.The Making of V is awesome. To see these guys at work is inspiring to say the least. They don't check their emotions at the door. They invite you into their home, studio, etc. and let it all hang out.The CD doesn't knock my socks off, but it is good. If you like out-takes and demo versions, there is some great stuff here."
5,Great Product,I had been carrying wood into our place in my bare arms... that sucked. I bought this just in time for Christmas and it's been great. It feels very strong and works perfectly.
5,Sturdy and well worth the money,I ordered this for our camping trips so we can haul wood in our vehicle and not get the trunk dirty. It works great. The material is heavy duty and very durable. I like that it folds flat enough to tuck under the seat when not in use. Great investment and I'm sure I will be using it for years and years.
4,fire log carrier,"Product pretty much as I expected. Have only been using it for a few weeks, but so far is holding up. Very large size holds all of the logs without spilling over the ends. Material is not cloth, more like a vinyl-type material, which is ok but not sure of its long term durability. Seems well made."
5,Best contracts casebook available,"Dessent is brilliant and a contracts wizard. He distilled contracts into a simple casebook. He trimmed all the fat out of every case, so students don't have to waste time reading useless stuff. I loved this casebook, and think it was the best casebook I read in law school."
4,EACH BOOK BETTER THAN THE LAST,This is the third of what I understand is a projected seven book series on two cousins from Rhodes who sale the seas as merhcantmen around 300 B.C. Each book is better than the last and as the cousins grow and mature with each adventure so does our fondness for them.
3,"""What happened to the Song?""","I enjoyed the show, ""Married With Children"" very much.The only problem I had was the intro. of the shows..Music SUCKED to high Hambugers!It was then I realized that they could not use the ""Love & Marriage"" theme due to copyright reasons.But otherwise in all..Was a good video."
1,"it's a technical grade saltpeter, not food grade","There is no mention in the product description that this is a technical grade saltpeter, not a food grade... meaning this probably shouldn't be used to cure meats.Disappointing."
4,Una pesadilla pero de risa,"Un curioso cuento sobre la vida de un luchador que busca su renombre en ""El Sueno Americano"". La historia es bien chistoso y chido. Se trata de como Miguel ""Cachondo"" Sanabria sale de Sinola cuando deja la hija de un jefe de un narco cartel embarazada. Un groupo de huevones lo sique hasta Los Angeles mientras hay mucho aventura por el camino. Por el camino encuentran romance,persecucion, engano ,fraude y desilusion. ""El Sueno Americano"" no es lo que el protagonista esperaba pero si es algo que nunca se le va olvidar. Los que lo siguen son una bola de ratas que son comicos en las situaciones que enquentran. Para todos el sueno es una pesadilla. Recomendo esta pelicula por que te va dejar casi con lagrimas de soltar una carajada!"
1,Junk - You get what you pay for,I purchased two of these and after less than a month one of these is already useless. It has an intermittent open conductor that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Obviously no good for performances and less than helpful at home. My email to SoundTech for replacement bounced back as undeliverable. Don't buy.
1,Nothing Compared to the original,Sorry but this album is nothing compared to the original by andrew. The depth of voice of the lead singer is lacking and the orcherster is half a sleep I was very disapointed by this album. I STRONGLY reccomend the orignal instead.
5,Wonderful music!,"I have the movie soundtrack with Julie Andrews, a version with Mary Martin, but this is my favorite because it includes songs not heard in the movie: How Can Love Survive, No Way to Stop It, and Something Good."
5,An excellent book for anyone who is applying for an MBA program,"Without the information, I would not have known the best way to start writing an essay for an MBA program. It gave me very valuable information. I liked the analysis of each question type and the detailed information about what schools are really looking for. I certainly recommend it."
5,Very useful stuff written in a very good language,"Have read only about 10% so far but already love it. Great language, clear structure and valuable content. Found it useful not only for MBA but also as a general guide for being successful candidate on labor market."
5,He knows what the adcom wants!,"This is not my first try at knocking on the doors of the top MBA programs. Fortunately I found this wonderful book before I started my campaign this year. The book helped me to identify several mistakes that I've made in my previous application, and of course much more things that I can improve, especially in the essay writing part. Amazingly, the insights to the application process that the author shared in this books matches perfectly with the feedback that I got from the schools that I applied before. On top of that, the book also gives out hands-on instructions to address each aspect with a lot of details. Also it teaches so many smart techniques on how to positioning and marketing yourself. To me, it is an extremely practical guide to help me through the process."
5,Excellent Resource for Essays,"I applied to Darden using another reference and online resources before I found ""MBA Admissions Strategy"". I was blown away by the insight that permeates each chapter, and I corrected manymistakes on my HBS app. I do not know what Gordon's background is, but he clearly knows exactly what goes on behind the scenes at adcom. He even explains what kind of people end up on the adcom and how to tailor your message to them.So, I was waitlisted at Darden and now I have an interview atHarvard. Wow! Can't argue with results like that. It was a lot of work but this book was my sole guide in transforming my essays. I am not an excellent writer but I am very pleased with the results. I would never try to apply to an MBA program without this book."
4,The ESSENTIAL MBA Admissions Guide,"for the second edition...After perusing many online and print resources on MBA Admissions, Gordon's MBA Admissions Strategy is truly one of the best resources an applicant can have in his/her toolkit. It should be required reading for any ambitious MBA applicant."
5,Wonderful words of wisdom--easy to understand,"Whether one is foster parent or considering becoming one, this wise and humane book will be of great value. The author has lots of experience and shows great common sense. It is a book for the professional and for the foster parent."
3,DISTURBING MESS IS A FASCINATING CURIO,"Very much a film of it's era, this disjointed mess is still a must see if you love Edie or have any interest in the 60's Warhol crowd.Edie certainly is everything you've heard, one of the 60's great beauties: charisma and vunerability coupled with mental instabilty-she's a ravishing nutcase (If you know her ghastly family history, it will only add to the tragedy). And sadly we're either seeing one of the 60's great under utilised acting talents or someone's obvious insanity caught on film-probably both.Ciao Manhattan has that train wreck quality in gorgeous colour and B&W.;The commentary adds plenty of anecdotes and flavour to this disturbing piece of pop culture history."
3,Interesting,"Bad plot, parts didn't seem to fit into the story.Still interesting to watch Edie even if she didn't make much sense."
3,Ciao Manhattan DVD,I ordered this item because I love and adore Edie Sedgwick. Yet I found the little bio of her rather dull and lengthy. It was not as exciting as I would have imagined her life to be. Still it is worth the time of getting a glimpse at her charm.
3,Won't fit with many cases,"I'm not sure why anyone makes iPod/phone chargers that simply don't fit in the opening of most cases these days. Oh, because suckers like me buy them anyway! If you use a case that is not wide open at the dock, this connector will not work with your case. The followup question should be why do case manufacturers still not make the accessory openings large enough? I think you know the answer."
3,It does the job,"I wasn't expect it a lot of this product (it is a cable anyway), but I can say it is very durable even when the handling is not that good as sometimes I haved to pull it with strength to keep it stretched, I also though it was a little bit longer, but it does the job."
5,Stellar work!,Newsradio is one of our family's most favorite TV series! It's Dave Foley and Phil Hartman at their absolute best! This show is well written and flawlessly acted and directed. Everyone who worked on this show must be so proud of their work.
3,A Pretty Good Deal,"I picked up the NewsRadio Fan Favorites DVD as a gift.It looks like a pretty good deal and includes these Season 3 episodes:ChristmasThe TrainerRapLed Zeppelin Boxed SetComplaint BoxRose BowlKidsAirportTwins---I got a chance to see the DVD. It is simply Disc 2 fromNewsradio - The Complete Third Season.The packaging is different, but the menu and selections appear to be the same."
5,How Horwitz brought local history to life.,"What is most remarkable about this book is the research that went into it.Mr. Horwitz meticulously plodded from one courthouse to the next along the Ohio River bordering three states. He tracked down old court cases where claims had been filed for reimbursement against the Confederate raid led by General John Hunt Morgan.So what sparked this interest? First, he had a strong interest in the Civil War. So when Mr. Horwitz found himself living in one of the homes relieved of some horses during this diversionary tactic, he went to work.Instead of ignoring the significance of this conjunction of his passion with history, he began collecting data, delivering lectures at an historic museum - and would you believe it? - even accumulating anecdotes from descendants of those householders alive today.This is living history and I recommend it to American History buffs."
5,The Longest Raid of the Civil War,"Just a brief note to let Mr. Horwitz know how very much I have enjoyed his book, The Longest Raid of the Civil War. The stories from local people across Indiana and Ohio are just terrific. Thanks again to the great contribution Horwitz has made to this page in Civil War and Ohio's history."
5,local resident,"Must read for residents of the areas concerned. Brings 'characters' to life as people of the time. For school kids this book could bring the history home to them. The details of who & when are there if you want them, or it is an interesting read about a little known but exciting part of our history. Definitely worth a weekend in the swing with a glass of lemonade. Highly Recommended."
5,Buy this one for your personal library!!,"I love this book because it is so easy to read and one of those books you can't put down until completed because it captivates your interest. I was doing my family history concerning the TAYLOR family and was so intriqued by the book that I bought it and invited the author to our family reunion to share Morgan and his adventures. This is a must have book that inspires the basic Civil War buff and the knowledgeable historian also. The style of the writer makes it enjoyable for the reader. It is like reading a great novel, but accurately depicting the events."
2,"About his life, not his work.","I was really disappointed by this DVD. It is very much about his life, especially his marital problems, more than any of his work. The greatest (and much too lengthy) emphasis on his achievements is his Mexican burial film.If you're expecting to learn anything about his techniques you also will be disappointed. The DVD seems to explain his work as just random shots taken at will that happen to look good when viewed in the right mood and perspective.Buy a good book instead of this."
4,strand,I showed this dvd at a class at the local VA hospital where I have a Photo group of out patients.It gave them some insight on Paul Strands life.We had a group discussion on the material covered in the DVD about his life.Worked out fine.
3,Fairly Good Edition,"This version of the Monopoly game is Ok. The game pieces are excellent, the board is fair and the chance and other cards are quite cute. However, the money is small and there is not enough of it. It doesn't allow for that many players to play. The tin container is very efficient. For what I paid for it, it's darn right excellent. I paid $11.00 at Toys R Us several years ago during Christmas time. I couldn't believe it. It may have been a mistake on the store's part, Because everywhere else I looked it was about 50.00 bucks. So for the $11.00 bucks that I paid, it's a darn good buy. Would I pay never pay over $100.00 bucks for it."
3,Psychology of Chart Patterns Review,Psychology of Chart Patterns was OK - the author makes some good points. Before I bought it I took a quick look to see how long the book was - unable to find the number of pages. I know $10 isn't a lot of money but I was expecting a little more then 7 pages (cover included).
5,great concert,"this warts and all is much better than warts and all volume one..the highlights include a 25 minute version of Kids, a very good timmy tucker and some other extended jams which were good as hell"
1,Really?,"This video was quite a dissapointment. I was thinking it was in concert form. Nope. It's just a compliation of videos. There was nothing in this video that kept our interest. You truly get what you pay for. If you pay more than 50 cents, don't buy. Trust me. Unless you absolutely love Kutless and don't care about production."
4,Escape Fire good not great,"Although, it was professionally done, Escape Fire, missed a bigger point. As Big Pharma, Big Insurance, and Big Government have totally dominated and decimated ""Modern Medicine"", maybe the answer lies outside the paradigm. Nutrition, Naturopathy, etc are arguable better done non-medically..Within medicine the usual ""mavericks"" were interviewed, but who died and left MDs king? The answer, my friend is complimentary and alternative medicine as developed and practiced by the natural cognoscenti. Would you pay a premium to your house painter because he had a medical degree? I wouldn't, but unfortunately the people who made this movie would. I enjoyed the film Doctored much more because they were free of this biasis."
4,Timely subject... will we listen now?,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie though at times it was difficult to watch. I am always grateful for the suggestions and examples of what is being done in a better way, it gives much needed hope. The same kind of overdue message as those I've heard for climate change. We are the generation that must be the change for so many things. Change is hard but going down on a sinking ship while exclaiming how nothing else will work? That's a fate I hope we don't choose as a society.Too bad money is valued over precious lives. We can make one but not the other.I wish the cynics would just step aside and allow some new methods in. I especially feel that we can do much better by our war vets who are coming home to such uncertainty and bringing with them wounds on many levels of their being.Thanks for making this documentary!"
4,Fantastic.,"This cd is fantastic. The gutteral screams Jalme puts out are quite possibly the best in an entire genre. He lets his heart fly out of his chest and his lungs push out air vocalists in the heavy side of music wish they had.Even on the acoustic ""Bigger and Better Things"" he never lets down on his passionate vocal attack.The music throughout is very tight packed, and most of the tracks stay below the 2-minute mark. The last 5 songs were recorded live at a radio station since the whole cd alone would've been an EP without them.Very good stuff."
3,Some good info,"Talks about fib ratio confluence gathering up in price clusters and then zooming down into a smaller time frame to have a finer entry on a pivot break.Save your money, this information should already be widely known."
3,Pricey,I didn't read fine print and thought I was going to receive the 3 scoops pictured. A little pricey for one scoop.
2,lotsa flute,"you really have to love flute music to have 2+ hours, I didn't realize it was ALL flute."
1,DON'T GET THIS FROM AMAZON!!!!!,"Ok people. I ordered this from Oct. 13 and NOw it's Nov. 3. I still didnt' get it. They told me it's gonna be delayed until the 14... I'm rating this only a one star not because SIR James Galway isn't a great flutist, but it's Amazon's crappy service and lack of interest."
5,Hope for ADHD families,"In August 2005, we felt like we had exhausted ALL options and were considering medication for our daughter who was diagnosed with ADHD/NLD. We were really against meds and then I ran across this book on a search engine.Not only the book, but the CAER treatment and Dr. Weathers, have helped us change our lives significantly. We have been able to apply what we learned with the entire family. Our daughter's school year has been much better! She is now the happy, little girl who we once knew. Overall, our family is more balanced.The book and treatment can benefit any ADHD/NLD family who is willing to make changes in their home, not only with the ADHD child, but also with the parents and other siblings. This is truly a family changing approach!"
2,Advertisement not book,"The author has some interesting ideas about the genesis of ADHD. However, the only solution he offers is to come to his clinic and try a revolutionary new treatment that no one else uses and has not been scientifically evaluated. Basically this is a promotion for his clinic and not a book about ADHD. Although, it appears that some people have had success with his program, I wish I had known the book was not a self-help book."
5,"Finally a book and treatment that make sense, and work.","I read ADHD: A Path to Success by Dr. Lawrence Weathers. Prior to that I had read several other books on the subject. The school was recommending he take Ritalin but I did not want to go that route. Dr. Weathers book made a lot of sense so I took my 9 year old son to him for treatment. The changes that took place in a short period of time were quite dramatic. His behavior changed from being ""all over the place"" and impossible to handle to being cooperative and able to sit down and do his school work. I will be forever grateful to Dr. Weathers and I would highly recommend his book and treatment to other parents with the same problem."
1,Is this a book or a marketing ploy?,"I've read a good deal of this book and agree with most of what the author says. However, I don't have the resources to participate in his program. So how do I use his ideas to help my child (and myself)? Answer: I don't because I can't afford it. The book is misleading because it is marketing literature, not a parenting guide. By the way, notice that the vast majority of favorable reviews for this book come from the people who participated in the program. The reviews are not for the book. They are for the program. As such, they should be taken down because they are misleading as well."
2,advertisement for this therapy treatments,"The author's theory can be explained in one chapter. The book is an advertisement for his therapy program. You won't find any real recommendations about how to solve the problems for a child ""with ADHD"". The answer to everything is his therapy program. He reports nothing but outstanding success with his therapy program. At best it is a general guide for good parenting skills."
1,Load of Garbage,"I have never read such a load of garbage before encountering this book. If you go to this, (I hesitate to call him this) Doctor's, site you will notice he only accepts patients he is 100% certain he can help. After reading this swill, I can only conclude he accepts patients who he is 100% certain don't have a problem to begin with.I'm left wondering what his advice would be to a person suffering from bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. ""Your not suffering from psychosis! but rather an intricate emotional defense system that I can help you unravel! Oh, and please don't smoke around me I cant stand the way it smells, er I mean it will completely destroy my treatment for reasons I can't begin to explain!"""
5,Different Approach from Talk Therapy and Medication,"My 20 year old son who was on medication for ADD and smoking pot was giving my wife and I a very difficult time when we came across Dr. Weathers book. I was very taken with Dr. Weather's approach and pursuaded my son to read his book. After he read the book he was ready to try the techniques recommended by Dr. Weathers as he was not happy with the medication claiming that medicine put him in a 'zone'. The straight talking Dr. Weathers and his method of confronting and getting rid of old disturbing experiences worked. My son has since stopped smoking, given up medication completely (after being on different ones for over a year) and is gaining self confidence every day. He is well on his way to completing his degree at UCLA. The examples in the book of how families treat kids with ADD were an eye opener."
1,Dressing up: Transvestism,"It turned out this book was not available any more so was cancled off the order. An e-mail was sent to me about this, which explained the situation. I was disappointed, of coarse, but not angry or upset.Rock onJohn Steen Sr."
5,"If a Giants fan likes it, you know it's good","This DVD of last year's world series is very well done. I am a life-long Giants fan who agonized over the loss, but realized they over-achieved just to make the world series.I love baseball and I love the Giants. That said, I found the video to be an excellent record of the series and pointed out a lot of interesting details, not just home runs and big moments. It's well shot and edited and the team that put it together worked hard to do an excellent job of this production. I should know: I have produced high end media such as films and videos for many years and I know what it takes to deliver a solid product such as this effort."
4,Could be best world series ever,"even though I am a Giants fan, this World Series was so fun to watch. Seven very competitive games. It seemed like at times it was Bonds vs. the Angels. It's going to neat to be able to relive it any time that I want to."
2,The worst edition yet!,"This year's (2003) edition is so riddled with egregious omissions (such as the APA accreditations for many programs) that you'd be better off with last year's edition. Entire headings and subheadings are missing! Granted, some of the omissions are due to the schools themselves, but the APA should certainly know which programs they accredit. If you buy this book, you'll have to go to the APA website to get that information. This year, I cannot recommend it."
4,Good with a word caution,"I love the texture of this paper; this is just what I was looking for. However, perhaps due to the texture, there seems to be more lint and paper fragments in the box. You must be extremely careful to brush each sheet before you print, and even then, lint or dust releases over time revealing white paper where the ink was. I've had to use spot tone a few times to repair prints. If you can live with this quirk, you'll love this paper. It prints colors beautifully, even the blacks are almost as dark as with glossy or pearl paper."
3,"explains XP jargon, but doesn't support its assertions","I found the book Questioning Extreme Programming to provide a good explanation of XP for people who don't already know its jargon.However, Pete's assertion that XP only works in a certain niche of possible project-types isn't supported in the book -- the assertion is made many times, but no real evidence is presented. Since there are many successful projects out there doing XP, the niche must not be as small as Pete says.I agree with one point from another (not yet published) book on agile software development: XP can provide a great improvement in software quality in those companies that don't already have a good development process. If your company has a good development process with acceptible agility and good enough results, you don't need to change what you do."
4,Valuable read for the XP/Agile devotee,"I'll tell you at the outset I'm a big fan of agile programming. I lived through many years of waterfall development and all the pain that ensued. Having been convinced of the power and flexibility of Agile methodologies though hands on expereince there is *no* going back (never say never, eh?).Although this book is written to debunk XP (no matter what the intro says), it doesn't do that job. What is does do very well is raise many of the questions that anyone intersted in Agile should ask themselves -- no matter if they have been practicing agile methodologies for years, or if they are just thinking about it.Even if your are a 100% died in the wool fan of agile/XP/whatever - this is a very valuable book. It'll cause you to think and question. And that is always good."
3,valuable for coaches; needs more valid research,"Some quotes from a longer review that I wrote:""presents many good challenges that need to be addressed""""Questioning XP did not appear to be backed by enough meaningful research or experience to provide a truly honest critique of XP. Its conclusions did not seem to be in line with the evidence presented in the rest of the book. However, I do recommend it for XP coaches--it does provide a thorough awareness of the issues that will be faced on an XP effort.""A complete review is available at xprogramming.com."
3,hmmmmmmmm.. OK!,"In Questioning Extreme Programming, the book helps you answer such questions:* Is the cost of change really low?* Does XP do proper testing?* Does XP make sense?* Is XP a return to the dark ages?* What can other approaches learn from XP?* Do you need process improvement or process change ?* Why are developers so zealous about adopting XP?* Is XP suitable for your projects?* What is the next step after Extreme Programming?After reading this thought-provoking book, software developers can make an informed decision about Extreme Programming, and whether it is suitable for their organization. Readers will also be able to determine whether Extreme Programming is inappropriate for their project. Discover for yourself. Look past the hype, and start asking the hard questions about how software is built!"
4,Fit very well for WIDE feet.,"I ordered these the other day for my main shoes for a trip to Cancun. I was a bit hesitant about the width they stated when I ordered the 11-XX, which was reported as EEEE. Well, they fit extremely well, the ball of the foot is quite wide, the underside of the velcro straps is well-cushioned, and the heel has a very cushiony feel to it. I'll update the review after walking on them for a week; but I had a pair of New Balance and they were nowhere near the quality/support of this item and lasted one summer."
3,Poor Sylvia...,"It bothers me that the people who compile these collections so often seem to go out of their way to avoid including some of the bigger hits that the artists are known for. It wouldn't be so bad if there was a complementary compilation available but, of the two Sylvia cds out there, neither include Tumbleweed, which was a big song. While it's nice that several b-sides and rarities are included, it sure would have been nice to show the artist and her fans a little more respect, as she didn't have an extremely long recording career with RCA. It's not like she had 100 chart hits..."
4,Pretty damn cool!,"Much better than their first release...they're actually structuring their songs! Some cool Bungle-esque middle eastern sounds, sped up and mulched by a twelve speed bicycle....not bad!"
5,Great Book,"When I found out that there was a part 2 to this book I was very excited, and couldn't wait for its release. I love the characters, and the love that they share is unbelievable. Although I am giving this book 5 stars, I can honestly say that I will never be able to read part 1 again. I will say that for those who are thinking about purchasing this book, you should definately read part 1 first."
5,RAY AND J 2-,I loved the book. The book mirrors life. In life there are no perfect endings.The characters are realistic. Giovanni reminds me of my husband. He is quiet and strong.
5,I haven't stopped crying,I'll have memories of what made both Renee and Jay's special and what their love meant as well as what their love meant for Renee and just who she was and turned into.
1,This CD Really Sucks,"I ordered this thinking I would get original recordings of some of the best music made by the 60's English group (Eric Burdon and the Animals). Wrong. These are all recuts of the originals and sound NOTHING like the originals. Burdon has (or had) a terrific voice, but he has a really stupid habit of singing lyrics off-beat and off-key in live performances or recuts... apparrently he thinks it sounds ""bluesy"" or hip, but it actually sounds like crap. The classics like House of the Rising Sun, San Francisco Nights, We Gotta Get Out of This Place, When I was Young, White Houses, and the rest are some of my all time favorite songs: this garbage is so bad I am going to chuck the CD and try to find the originals somewhere else. Listening to this CD makes me cringe.. and somebody should pimp slap Eric Burdon for releasing this."
4,Re-cuts with new band,"This is album is a 'best of'...sort of...!! Eric resings these tunes with a new band, so the tempo and production is different than the original 'album/radio' version. This is nonetheless a good album as it features the mainline songs, sung slightly different. Soul and emotion is still there in the tunes.Not for people looking for 'The best of EB album/radio' versions...!!"
4,Wow,"this is some good stuff, not quite like anything you've heard before. dont be put off by the fact that you can't understand a word they say on this album, the music and the pure emotion in the voices you hear speaks more than words can convey. the music is a bit darker and heavier than a few people may enjoy, especially if they've been weaned on a steady diet of popular american music"
4,Nordic Pride,"Delicate walls of guitar feedback and rich basslines await the patient listener, but you'll also have to negotiate a disconsolate falsetto and Icelandic lyrics that are pushed up in the mix on this album. Musically, it bears strong resemblance to The Verve circa ""A Storm In Heaven"" with the added intimacy of a string section that invokes the quaintest of moods. Sigur Ròs tread a fine line between pastoral melodrama and ornate spaciousness, but when they get it right this album sounds nothing short of majestic."
3,"Very nice, but...","It's indeed, a very NICE album. It's nice to listen to when I am reading, going to sleep, trying not to think of anything, but upon further inspection... it doesn't really hold up. My father once said to me that his problem with minimalism was that, they wrote really nice introductions but it never went anywhere. I never agreed with him, but I feel that that statement applies well to this record. They have a wonderful knack for making nice arrangements with shifting seventh chords and whatnot, but it basically comes out in the end not really MOVING me in the least. Though they have their own sound, the comparisons come rolling off my tongue so easily. Certainly, the new Radiohead is not far off... I've found it reminds me most of Rachel's ""The Sea and The Bells"", only it doesn't hold as much depth. So, in the end... a very nice album, I'd be interested in seeing them live and possibly hearing some of their other records, but it doesn't really leave me feeling fulfilled."
5,amazing,"This album is very very cool... I picked it up in Iceland almost two years ago. I'm very excited that it's now available in the U.S. I've just read that the version available here is missing one of the tracks which the original album included (the opening track). This is ashame, since this track is one of the album's components that ties the whole thing together.The album as a whole is truly unique. It plays with your emotion which is indicative that it really comes right from the hearts of these beautiful guys who created it. The album is a bit reminiscent of Pink Floyd while it also seems to have influenced Radiohead's latest album.The lyrics sound beautiful. If it's possible that the grandeur of a peculiar country like Iceland could be described only by sound, Sigur Ros has already accomplished it."
5,A music of silence and noise. . .,"I had never heard of this Reykjavík based band until last night, when I saw them in concert, so I was completely unprepared for the experience. I left feeling as if I'd attended a strange ritual combining classical music, avant-garde rock, and a mass. Sigur Rós manages to bring the ethreal feel of a Philip Glass opera together with the ambiant tone of Radiohead, the serene, tortured vocals of a gregorian chant performed by Smashing Pumpins, with occational ephiphanic peaks of driving drums and impelling base echoing the rage of Tool; and yet the totality is their own. The concert was more like a trance, I wanted the audience to stop clapping between songs so I could simply float between waves of sound and silence in this extraordinary realm the band managed to create - they performed like classical musicians rather than rock-stars, not speaking, not posing, merely playing their ethreal mucis and leaving the audience in some transubstatiatory state. Brilliant."
2,Audio Version,"The message of this audio is an absolute 5 out of 5 stars, but the audio is read very fast and for me, it was difficult to process what is being said. I have the book and have read it several times and refer to it often. I purchased the audio so that I could enjoy the message on my way to work. For me, I would have preferred the audio to be read slower and maybe discussed a little. However, if you are not one to read, then by all means, get the audio, for the message is very powerful."
1,Disappointed!,"I felt I wasted my money on this CD audio book. It feels like it's ""CUT & PASTE"" from book 1. Book 1 is excellent and I've listened to it many, many times, so the minute he begins a new topic, it's verbatum from book 1. I thought this Part II would expand on book 1 and cover topics that hadn't been discussed."
4,Feels like there should be 2 CDs when there's only one,I love the CD but it stops short. There should be 2 CDs on this especially when Jerry is just reading the book. He get's half way through and stops. The end? Ugh- Left me feeling half satisfied!
5,Easy to understand and apply,"I have enjoyed all of the Abraham-Hicks material that I have purchased, this one is no different. Some of the Processes are really fun to do!"
1,Ask and it is Given Part 2,"Don't buy this item if you have the book Ask PART 1Part 2 is in the book and also on CD - so if your lookingfor part two GET THE BOOKI purchased the book and CD from Amazon and since I opened the CD's you can't return them so I am stuck with two copies. Contacted Esther Hicks thru her web site and was offered something comparable, also to incur more shipping and handling and no even exchange was offered.Just beware when you buy from Amazon, there is no guarantee from the publisher, distributor and author themselves if you don't buy it from them direct - so be clear on your point of purchase and what you are giving up by purchasing thru Amazon. I have nothing against Amazon and have been a long time customer, I do feel they should place a disclaimer on their site regarding point of purchase - voids guarantee."
3,"IF YOU READ THE BOOK BEFORE , DO NOT BUT THIS CD .","This CD is same as reading the book 'Ask and It is given' so buy it unless you hate to read the book.I already read the book before and no doubt, I loved it but when I saw on Amazon that CD is available, I thought jerry hicks has added more to it than the book and may be I can learn more about these processes but I ended up not listening to it after 2nd CD since I read his book twice before.After reading his book, I was so excited to learn something more and new in this CD ...Do not buy this CD as its contents are same as Book, Read by author, word to word."
2,Part II...?,"It is obvious from the responses here that this is simply a replication of the book in audio form. I found myself mislead on the ""Part II"" on the cover - buyer beware!"
2,Ask and it is given,disc 3 loads as pep boys album cover and loads the song titles instead of the the disc content. and the album titles do not display any order so I have to search my media player to find to next cd
3,I found it rather slow-moving,"I listened intently but was unable to get beyond the first two CD's -- perhaps I've already heard too much motivational, success-oriented, self-help kinds of things, but this one lacked enthusiam and anything new. Content was OK."
3,Newbies might like the techniques.,"If you are just beginnning to learn about the Law of Attraction, there are techniques that might be very helpful. I was looking for something new in information, but I have read a lot on the Law of Attraction."
1,Stale Presentation,I only ordered it because I needed extra to get free postage.I found the information stale and poorly presented. Would not recommend.
1,funniest BS ever...,these people should see a shrink ASAP if they are seriously believe what they claim...
5,Introducing Abraham should be first.,"""Introducing Abraham - the secret to the secret"", (DVD) should be seen first and then the ""Ask and It is Given"" next. They are both great."
3,If you want ot know about diplomatic LIFE this is for you,"If you are loooking for a treatise about diplomacy, this book is not for you. If yu are looking for a book that gives you a good overview about the people and the embassies in Washington, give this one a read. It deals with the inner workings of every day embassy life and provides a little hisoty into the enbassies interviewed. In my mind a worthwhile read."
1,Disappointing,"This is a missed opportunity. If the book had a competitor, there would be another view of Embassy Row available. Unfortunately, there's not. This journalist has difficulty distinguishing between the trivial (e.g. what videos ambassadors watch) and the important. It reads like a term paper in which the student had to write 15 pages with 5 pages of material. I suspect the journalist stretched the thin material she assembled from the limited access she received. At times, she invokes cultural stereotypes that are disturbing. At best, it's a ""People Magazine"" view of Embassy Row, focused on the glamour rather than the substance of diplomatic life."
4,a great read,"Twilight Man is a wonderfully detailed, moving novel about an interracial marriage in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The two main characters, Karen and Conrad, are likeable, warm, and fully developed, and you can't help but root for them. In fact, they stayed with me for days after I finished the book. Lenore DeKoven's attention to detail is wonderful, and the descriptions of the characters' lives in LA is particularly interesting. Their day-to-day struggles to make their marks in Hollywood is made all the more difficult by pressures from both the black and white communities, and by the complexities of negotiating a social life that includes them both. Heartbreaking, funny, and sexy. All in all, a great read."
2,Feel-Good Book But...,"This is the kind of book that tries to be informative and enlightened, but only appeals to a limited group of people: namely, the parents of undeniably abysmal failures. Sure it's nice to be told, as a parent, that if your child is about as responsible an adult as Ted Bundy that ""it's okay"" and ""it's not the parents' fault,"" but come on! What kind of parents are really going to buy into a line like THAT?"
1,Another Idea Is...,"Everyone should try the Talmud and The Torah to learn better human relations than you will find in this book. The Judaic rules about ""lashon hara"" say it all and say it all better than the Jacobs duo."
4,This is the older edition,"An updated second edition, published 2011, can be found here:The Number Sense : How the Mind Creates Mathematics, Revised and Updated Edition. I have reviewed the book on that page."
2,Outdated,"Dr. Dehanae has continued his research. Neuroscience has advanced so far in the last 10 years that there is very little to glean from this this book. See instead, Reading in the brain and for information on number processing, Dr. Dehanae's latest publications."
4,Good summary of research on the psychology/neuroscience of numerosity,"I got this book as a gift and wasn't expecting too much. It's a little dry -- you'll be exercising your number sense while you count the pages until the end -- but it's very comprehensive and, even if it's not engaging, it's interesting in many parts. Overall it's a nice summary of the research going on in psychology and neuroscience about how the brain represents numbers and performs calculations."
2,"Again, who are these people?","Better than that complete ripoff DVD ""Unforgettable Journey"", but still pretty lame. Once again there are a bunch of no names providing their brilliant insights. Who are these people and why do I watch them for an hour talking about U2? I particularly liked it when one guy, some unknown local musician, said that he liked Joshua Tree the best because that was BEFORE THEY GOT INTO ALL THAT POLITICAL STUFF? What, are you joking? There's a bunch of other no names, the only one of reasonable notariety is BP Fallon, but he's about as boring to watch as paint drying. He speaks so slowly and deliberately its like he has a speak impediment without the stutter. You get frustrated just waiting for him to complete a simple thought. Overall, the women who ran the video and interviews is not bad and its worth a one-time watch. At least there is some footage and music. But borrow this one if you can."
4,MY review,"I was very pleased with this book, and it's coming of age sexual experience. i think that everyone can relate to one of the four characters. the book offers a look at different aspects of sexual intercourse, and what people really look for in it. and the books twist ending guarrantees the reader a smile. i hope to someday direct the play, but for now i will continue to read it and find more meaning."
4,A Lot of Laughs,Had a fun time with this one...like really being at a beach place. Those two guys and the girls were all a delight to read. Hope I can see it some time!
3,Fun to perform,"Loads of laughter kept the audience rolling. Gripping plot, reminds me alot of a Seinfield episode.. good"
1,fan faves?,"The disc included was Season 9 disc 2, ....we already had season 9, and expected something that included actual fan favorites. VERY DISAPPOINTING! I wondered why the product description didn't include a list of episodes...now I know why."
1,Disappointed,I chose the Fan Favorites because I thought it would be episodes of some of the more funniest shows. I was highly disappointed! The video should've been title The Worst of The King of Queen!
1,disappointing,"Unclear what it is before u buy it. Thought it was bloopers, deleted scenes etc. Turns out it s a bunch of episodes I already had"
1,Wrong DVD,"I ordered the King of Queens Fan Favorites DVD and when I opened it the label on the DVD also said this but when I played it the DVD was one of the discs from Season 8 of the King of Queens. Since I did not play it for awile after I bought it, it was past the return date. I didn't know that I should check it, I usually don't have to check any DVD that I buy. So, not very happy review."
3,"good fun, novelty, toy keyboard",I bought this recently as a joke for a friend who had complained that they couldn't practice piano away from home.It is a pretty good novelty toy - very durable - and suitable for small kids.The sound is quite pleasing but it does require you to hit the keys very cleanly away from the edges --> not good for learning to play quickly or properly.Lots of fun though!
4,Great Value,"I received it quite fast (within 1 or 2 days from ordering). The outer packaging is a little cheesy but don't let that persuade you. The quality of the toy is actually quite good. It comes in a nylon pouch with a drawstring closure which is nice. The one I saw at Target did not include a pouch to carry it in and costs $24.99 on sale. This one only costed $14.99. Quality is pretty good. Keyboard must be on a solid surface to work properly. Overall, great value."
1,Completely unreadable,"I thought this sounded pretty clever, from the title and description on the back cover - but it was TERRIBLE! I forced myself about half-way through it and gave up - the characters are cookie-cutter, the ""mystery"" - well, you really couldn't care less and are glad the guy is dead and actually cheering on whodunit, whoever that might be (although I peeked at the ending because I can't stand not knowing what happens, and it really isn't what you think) and the main character, Rosie Marie, is a weak-willed, neurotic shrew. The only somewhat likeable character is Michael Nash, her one-time paramour, and even he is obviously an idiot for still liking this walking bag of neuroses. Ugh. A strictly by-the-formula romance fills out the excrable plot, making me want to vomit out of my brain everything I read. This one goes into the ""sell this"" pile IMMEDIATELY."
5,Suicide Survivors will find this book helpful,Worden's book is an outstanding resource for professionals helping grieving children. I would recommend it to those who work with child suicide survivors. Children and Grief will provide insight regarding the child's tasks of grief.
3,"Good book, no follow-up from author","I read this book upon the recommendation from my son's Montessori teacher. I understand early-start potty training much better having read the book (my own pediatrician discouraged me from even broaching the topic before my son's 2 yo check-up) and in my opinion, the book is most helpful the earlier it is read. I will start the process of potty training my next child at 12 months if not before. However, on her web site the author has a ""contact the author"" link to email questions. I emailed a fairly quick question to her weeks ago and never received contact back of any sort. Why even have this feature on a self-promotional web site if there is no response?"
3,A Good Quick Read,"I like all the tips in this book, but it was mostly just the author's justification for getting kids out of diapers sooner. Which I didn't need since I already agreed with her. I say get it from the library if you can."
5,Fabulous book!,"This book makes so much sense! We started sitting my 10 month old daughter on the potty last week and she really has the hang of it! I know that it will take some time, but I think this is really going to work for us."
2,repetitive and condescending,A lot of parenting type books fall into this the trap of repeating themselves over and over again to make a point. This one is no exception. Word for word sometimes from one chapter to the next. And the tone of the author is just annoying and condescending.The one redeeming quality (and the reason I bought it) is the discussion of the history of potty training and how it and the popular theories have changed over the decades/centuries.
2,Useless Book for Potty Training Our 2 year old,"We were looking into potty training our 2 year old. This book was useless for a 2 year old. It just basically went into details on how to routinely put babies on the potty from before a year onward at certain times and go from there. It did not detail a real program how to potty train a 2 year old that had never had potty experience before. The potty training in a day book from the 1970's (NOT TERI CRANE) worked for us. We potty trained our 26 month old boy in 2 days. I recommend that book, NOT this one!"
1,"Fake name, no drivers, no support","If you are running Windows 98 or ME this is the Camera for you. If you are using an OS from the last 6 years, it is not.It is advertized as a 640x480 web cam, but can only film at 320x200. The software that comes with it works with Win2k and XP, but if you want to use it for other programs like Yahoo IM, forget it. In 2000 it crashes the computer, and in a fresh install of XP it just gives a black rectangle. It worked in Win98, though.There is no support at IBM because IBM had nothing to do with this camera, they just sold their name to Xirlink. Xirlink seems to have gone bankrupt years ago, so they offer no support either."
3,CUTE TOY BUT . . . .,"I bought this toy for my 7 month old daughter. She loved it and smiled at the monkey thinking he was the greatest thing since peanut butter and jelly. After a day, the monkey would get stuck and stop spinning so I returned the toy and exchanged it for a new one. I assembled the second one and again the monkey didn't work properly. Besides all that, this toy has no educational value at all. My daughter seemed to enjoy it for the moment and then became bored with it. I really would not recommend this toy."
2,Not Great,"I bought this item for my 7 month old son and kept it for a whole 2 hours. He was so mesmerized by the dancing monkey, that he paid no attention to the rest of the toy. I exchanged it for the laugh and learn table and he loves it! Don't waste your money on this. The laugh and learn table is cheaper and so much better. It has more for baby to do. The bandstand is great because a baby can sit in front of it and play, but it doesn't hold their attention long enough to be useful."
3,Not worth the batteries,"I bought this for my daughter for christmas (she was 6 months old). At the time she was not real interested. Now that she is 13 months old, she still isnt! And she loves music and LOVES to dance...but not this toy! In that time I have also changed the batteries 3 times in 6 months!!!"
2,Somethings not right!,My Daughter got this toy the beginning of November for her birthday. Once she figured out how everything worked it's all she played with until then middle of Dec when it started studdering. I have changed the batteries with several different brands and it will work for a few tries and then it's back to the same old thing. My sister in law got one for there daughter for christmas and it was doing the same thing right out of the box.I called Fisher-price they said there were no reports of any problems with this and they sent me a form to return the legs and I would receive the replacement toy in 6-8wks. That's a rediculous turn around time. Guess waiting the time for a new one is better then wasting it.
2,"FUN TOY, BUT NEVER SHUTS OFF...","I bought this for my 6 month old daughter, and although she seems to enjoy it for a while, it never shuts off. i thought the whole point of the toy is that when the baby moves, they get rewarded with lights and sounds. However, that doesnt seem to be the case. Id invest my money in another toy!!"
1,Dangers over looked,"My 9 month old son received this toy for Christmas. He loves it. However, now that he is pulling up on everything, the toy is too short. The thing that concerns me the most is the spinning monkey. My son was playing with this toy the other day and his shirt cuff got caught on the monkey. Before I could get over to him, it had pulled off his sleeve and was wrapping it around the monkey. I don't know what would have happened if I had not been standing right there. The same day, his pacifier on a string also got caught on it. He is only allowed to play with this toy with close supervision. I will be contacting the manufacturer."
4,"Maybe not the most durable toy, but it's fun!","Like some previous reviews, my biggest complaint about this toy is that the monkey broke almost immediately. But that did not take away from the basic fun this toy provides. The rest of toy still works fine, and my kids never seemed to mind that the monkey wasn't dancing along with them. We've had this for over 6 months now, and it still gets played with almost daily. We have only replaced the batteries once in 6 months, so as long as you're using a brand name battery, I don't really think that's an issue with this toy. For the price I paid at the time, it was well worth the money spent!"
2,Do not waste your money,"We bought this for our little boy who loves music. He hates this toy. He gets more stimulation from a link a doo ring.We have only had it a week and they have already broke it. My little one grabs on to the monkey and stops it from dancing. Now he spins one way gets stuck and makes an awful loud sound.In the store when it was in the box, my boys loved hitting the drum. Now they only care about who can stop the monkey from dancing.I agree with everyone when they say it is too small. It has two height adjustments. One so they can sit on the floor and the other so they can stand. They are taller than the unit.Battery eater. The thing should have been made by energizer. It never stops it just keeps going and going till it eats up all your batteries.If my husband had not thrown out the box, this toy would have been heading back to the store."
4,My daughter liked it!,I bought this for my seven month old. She's just learning to crawl. This toy is great because she can crawl to it and pullself up to sitting.... I wish I would have bought it a little earlier. There is an off switch it's found underneath the toy. Great product!
3,Disappointed,"I purchased this toy for my 11 month old last week. I was a bit disappointed, it is smaller than it appeared in the pictures on the box. The height is adjustable, but even at the highest setting it still is smaller than I expected. The dancing monkey is not attached well enough, everytime I turn on the toy my son pulls the monkey off. It is only a matter of time until that breaks. Fisher-Price should know that babies six months and up are going to pull on things and adjust designs accordingly. However, I did love the carribean style music and so did my son. The music was a refreshing change from other musical toys in his age group."
3,He loves it...but Mom thinks it's too short,"My son received this as a gift a couple of months ago when he was 6 months old. He loves the lights and especially loves the monkey on top. He quickly learned to pull himself up to a standing position, which is great. But, this toy is so short! The person that gave this to him thought that it would be good for him to learn to stand..which I suppose he has..but in another month he's going to be taller than the toy and have to bend over or sit down to play with it. That's my only complaint..just wish it could be adjusted more to be taller."
4,My Son Likes It!,"We received this toy as a christmas gift for my son when he was four months old. He wasn't able to start playing with it till he was about 5-6 months old. He loves this toy. The music, the lights, the drum, the monkey, he loves it all. I think this toy is pretty durable. But I didn't give it 5 stars, as I agree about the monkey. I think it ""sticks"" out above anything else on this toy and naturally the baby is going to grab at it. Although my son doesn't hold it ""hostage"", but still grabs at it every now and then. Other then that I think this toy is great and worth the money:)"
2,Fun But Not Durable!,"My son got this for Christmas when he was 7 months old. He loved swaying to the music and making the guitar and horn play. It was great until he started standing up and grabbing the monkey as other reviewers have stated. The sound started going and I thought it was the batteries, but upon replacing them, it still didn't work right, so it ended up in the trash. In the end, we got about 2-3 months of use out of this before it deteriorated, not a good track record for the price paid. You would think that Fisher Price would test these toys out on babies/toddlers before selling them. Clearly they would have realized that grabbing the monkey would eventually break the toy."
1,Boring-at best,"I was so excited when my son received this toy for his birthday. The box showed a brightly colored toy that he could stand up and play and that he can make his own music. WRONG-Even though my son is short, he could not stand up well with this low lying toy--EVEN AT ITS HIGHEST SETTING. He also could not make his own music. Any touch to the floor pad or to the keys would send off a computer generated sound. My son eventially got bored with it. For the kids that would actually be interested in this toy, the toy is not recommended for them. ONE STAR-ONLY BECAUSE IT'S THE LOWEST ALLOWED!"
2,Not worth the money,"My 16 month old son got this toy for Christmas (2 weeks ago!) and already doesn't play with it anymore. Which is surprising since he loves music. My biggest complaint is that it is supposed to have two levels: one for sitting and one for standing. Well, the standing position is a joke! My son can stand on the mat and at the highest level, it reaches a little bit above his knees. He has to bend down to play with it and he's NOT tall for his age. I would say this toy is more annoying than anything. And I can see what most others are saying about the monkey. My son likes to hold onto it as well and it's already making weird sounds. I would not recommend this toy."
2,Too bad it was a non-returnable gift,"Both my girls prefer the Leapfrog Learning Table to this. My 1 yr old continually pulls off the trumpet and is obsessed with trying to detach the monkey. The music or drumbeats that play when you step on the mat is very annoying (on any setting). It plays for about 30 seconds, and it is bothersome for us because our children have already moved on to the next toy before it stops. Sometimes we feel that it never stops....Too bad it was a gift and the box was destroyed when it was opened on my daughter's birthday, because my husband said it was the first thing going in the next yard sale...."
4,Very fun and cute,"My daughter got this for Christmas when she was 4 months old, and she interacts with it more every time she plays with it. I love the textured handle that encouraged her to sit on her own. Now she is able to play all the instruments and she raises her arms into the air to ""dance"" while sitting. This toy really makes her happy, and I like how it has three settings to use as she grows, up until she is playing her own music on the keyboard. However, there are a few reasons it doesn't get 5 stars from me. The mat part is pretty slick and on occasion her butt has slid right out from under her. I wish the volume had a quieter setting and that the lights were syncronized with the music instead of being so sporadic. Lastly, the horns have to be pushed hard in one direction to play. I wish they were more sensitive to her touch."
5,Baby loves it!,This toy was a great idea. Even when she is not playing with it she will activate it just to hear the music.
3,Uninterested,"My son is 20 months and he hasn't loved this toy yet. It never entertains him for very long, even if I'm playing with him. He's short for his age and is still too tall for this toy. His cousin loves music and she will play with it a little longer but not as long as other toys out there. It eats up batteries super fast and even with the sound setting on low will use up the batteries and just keep playing. I'll put the toy away for a couple weeks and bring it out and he still will only play with if for 5 minutes. Not our best buy."
3,not durable,"My 11 month son was given this as a Christmas gift and LOVED it. The problem is it stopped working in less than 24 hours. I should say it works for a few minutes then seems to short out. I've tried new batteries, and I think there is a shorted wire or my 7 year old twin niece and nephew played with it a little too much before they gave it to their cousin. Not sure, but if it's just this one or across the board. The box got thrown out, so no return, but I do think I'll try another one because he loves it so much"
1,Call Fisher Price about this toy.......get a voucher!!!!!,"I too purchased this toy and am very unhappy with it. My son played with it 4 times and the monkey no longer spins around and now makes a loud grinding noise. I called Fisher Price today and told them the problem and they told me that they would send me a voucher for any F.P. toy and instructed me to send them back the legs to this toy. So, F.Y.I., call the 1-800 # for Fisher Price if you too have the same problem."
1,Dangerous!,"My daughter received this toy a week ago for her 2nd birthday, and loves it, particularly the dancing monkey. She also loves the music and all the different blinking lights. It would be a great toy except that it is potentially dangerous. The problem is that the dancing monkey operates on a motor that makes it go around in a circle. Somehow my daughter's hair got stuck in the monkey. I heard her screaming and turned around to see her trapped face down on top of the toy. Of course the motor didn't stop and the monkey kept turning with my daughter's hair wrapped around it. I was able to turn the toy off and found a huge chunk of her hair had been pulled out by the root. It scares me the thought of this happening to a younger baby. Buyer beware!"
1,Not worth it!,"I bought this on clearance at WalMart for about $6. That's about what it's worth. It's entertaining for about a day, then quickly becomes annoying to the parents. Our monkey broke after about a week. This has no educational value... Save your money!"
1,Don't waste your money!! Buy something else instead!,I just purchased this toy for my 9 month old daughter a few days ago. I wasn't sure if I shoud because the reviews didn't look to great. But My daughter loves music and it just looks like fun so I decided to try it out. Well she liked it when it was still in the box and then for the rest of the day after I put it together. And after that she hasn't touched it since. She could care less about this toy. There just isn't enough to do on it. If she was younger and wasn't able to do all the things she can she would probably like it but it is just boring for my 9 month old daughter. So I am returning it to the store to get something she will actually like. So if your baby is not very eaisly entertained (which some babys are) then don't bother with this boring toy.
1,Do not buy this one,"If I had bought this mandoline (the fourth or fifth one I've owned and used over the years) in a store, I would have returned it. I wish I could return it. It is unduly complicated, adjusting the thickness is hard, the ""sled"" does not ride smoothly on the rails, and, perhaps most importantly, the slices it produces are not even."
1,Looks aren't everything,"OK, I bought this very pricy version because, lets face it its all stainless, and very well built. It is sturdy and will last life time. That said, it is not user friendly, the blade adjustments are not easy, as you have 3 cutting surfaces to adjust. The design may have been great years ago, but any diagonal blade or V blade models will cut much easier and faster then this beautifully slicer. Just try cutting string carrots and you will hate this slicer, the straight blade is very difficult to push raw carrots through. The standard holder will only cut to within 1/8"" of the blade so to the rest is cut on the board or out it goes.Yes, after spending all this money I am going back to my cheap plastic V blade that is super easy to use. Sorry Bron, time to retool your plant and start making V blade models. This was a bad investment."
1,Mandolin,I purchased this mandolin because of the great reviews. It is difficult to use and difficult to turn the knob to adjust the thickness. It is too late to return but I won't be using it.
1,Crushed Tomato Machine,"I was extremely disappointed in this product. If I wanted crushed tomatos I could buy a can at the grocery store. Unclear instructions for setup, and the holding mechanism is insufficient for a whole vegetable or fruit."
2,It did nothing for my abs,"I was disappointed in this product. I was told it was just as good as the Total Gym that Chuck Norris promotes and I thought the price was attractive in comparison. First thing was how small the Bron Mandolin is. I mean it's tiny. Not only that, there's no instructional video. I tried to lie back on it to work my hams, and the thing cut my gluteus Maximus! I had to get ten stitches! I'm also disappointed that the manufacturer is so in your face about eating vegetables I guess as a way to better health. I mean the box is covered with sliced tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, what have you. I'm a big believer in the Cro-Magnon diet and I think it's a personal decision. I really can't recommend this inferior exercise equipment.Bayou Fitness Total Trainer DLX-III Home Gym"
4,i love the first two trois movies,i like both of them. but the first one really had me speechless.the writer and director should of stopped at two. couldn't get with trois 3
1,Boring,"Aren't these the same women from the movie Players Club? They acting skills were unconvincing and listening to Michael Jai White's dialogue was like listening to a monotonous voice on a relaxation tape; I'd rather see his martial arts skills.The dialogue was bland,the cause and effect was predictable. I saw the movie on BET and half way through the movie, I fell asleep."
4,Batteries,"Always have gotten good products from Amazon.comWill continue to make more purchases when the need arises.Thank You,Doug Lenz"
1,virus,this game gave me a very bad virus and i use eset security and they fixed the problem but do not buy this game something is wrong with it
5,My favorite tipper,I LOVE this tipper! It has a heavy weight and the knob ends have enough durability to really whack the bodhran. I am very pleased with this purchase!
3,Wooden Bodhran Tipper,This is a nice tipper for the larger hand. I fould it a little large for my smaller hand but it works well with practice.
3,"Charming, but dated","A straight-forward adventure story. Although the main character is a coming-of-age boy, I wouldn't recommend this book for younger readers who wouldn't be able to read through the terminology and assumptions of an age less open to racial diversity than is now current."
5,this book is pure blues,"This book kicks ass. From the Cradle is Eric Clapton's next greatest notation ever made (next to unplugged and 24 nights of course"" If you liked his unplugged blues this book will blow you away. A must have for the profesional guitarist of today. If your a beginner to the blues I recomend you take 1 step at a time. start with Eric's unplugged albulm first, but if your motivated enough with his music and the blues. Go ahead and take it to the next level. you'll learn a lot."
2,Poor transcription,I really have had it with people that attempt to transcribe EC they always reduce it to the lowest common denominator of the transcribers knowledge of pentatonic scales.
2,I couldn't get through the reading!,"I am accustomed to listening to classics on audio--I've listened to a lot of Jane Austen on my work commute--but the narrator, Flo Gibson, is a poor choice. She sounds like she's smoked too many cigarettes and imbibed too much alchohol in her time. She sounds like a ""grandma"" type character no matter which character she's narrating. I found this too distracting and decided to get the other audio version of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"This hat was not at all what I expected. Very dissapointing for a department 56 product. First of all, it is HUGE!. I actually bought this to wear as a costume but there is just no way. It is almost 3 feet long and looks ridiculous. Also it is very thin on the sides. The cost to return a 3 foot long package is probably more than the hat is worth so I will just keep it. I am going to try to use it as a centerpiece somehow. I would have been very upset if I had paid full price for this but since amazon had it for so cheap, like I said I will just keep it and try to make it work for decor."
4,Great Concept - But allready been done,"Ok...heres the deal. If you like the BubbleGum Crisis Series then you will probably like this one. Truthfully the animation is a whole lot better in this series, but when I watched it, it was like dajavu of listening to the BubbleGum Crisis storyline all over again. I did however enjoy this series and it does have alot of differences between the series, but if you did not like BubbleGum Crisis you are not going to like this series. The 2nd DVD (episodes 5 - 8) is has better and I can't wait for the 3rd disk to come out. I enjoyed this series to say the least :)"
3,Manicure set,"This unit works fairly well. I think it is a bit underpowered. The discs are metallic, not actual stone as I would prefer. This doesn't work terrifically well at smoothing calloused or rough skin. It does file and shape nails fairly well and the polishing cylinders do a fair job of buffing out the nail surface."
2,Cute video but not what I expected,"This video consists of multiple ""chapters"" each dealing with different aspects of dog training. Each chapter discusses training a specific behavior. My overall impression is that the first step in training is discussed well in each chapter but large gaps exist between the first step and final behavior that are not addressed in the videos. My family gathered around the TV to watch this... we watched it twice... it has gone back in the cabinet and we're unlikely to refer to it again. This video also does not play from start to end - rather a menu is shown and you need to select the specific 5-minute chapter you wish to watch (such as ""training your dog to fetch""). We have found dog training books that are more convenient to use than loading the video. Books can be left on a table and refered to instantly - more convenient than a reference video."
1,Not Impressed!,"I wish I would had read more of the reviews before purchasing this DVD. I really thought it would teach me things I didnt know about training my new puppy. Instead what I got was a cartoon at the beginning and many many many 30 second segments on already well trained dogs. I had to keep the remote in my hand for the entire video because I was constantly hitting play. There was also a ""dogs perspective"" segments at the end of each ""lesson"". Why? I dont understand that. Im an adult not a child. Why the kiddie training video?I understand the necessity of treats at the beginning of training any dog however, the amount of treats given to the obviously already well trained dogs was a bit over the top.Basically, waste of money. I gave 1 star because I did learn how to teach my puppy to stay. Everything else I already knew."
2,Basic Training - yes; Intermediate Training - no,"This training video was very basic. We took our dog to ""puppy"" classes when she was young and also worked a lot with her. Since this video said this was intermediate training, I expected this to really be the next step in our training. I was wrong. It was a rehash of everything we already knew about training. I learned one new thing (magnet behaviors) and have seen good results from that, but I didn't see much on it that will help us correct ""problem"" behaviors. It was a good BASIC video, but if you're looking for intermediate training, this isn't what you're looking for."
2,Booooo,Had high expectations with the title but it didn't come through! I don't even see a section on potty training!
5,the dog whisperer,I'm a volunteer with a Golden Retriever rescue in Southern Califronia. This training has has allowed me to rehabilitate two dogs that had bitten people. Both are now in loving homes.Ed Buck
5,Thank You!,"We are very grateful to Paul Owens for giving us positive methods to help our fear aggressive shelter dog. We worked with a professional trainer whose techniques were similar to Cesar Millan. After three months, it was obvious that corrections and negative verbage would not work. Within three days of changing our strategy and using the techniques on this video, we observed significant changes in our dog. Being a teacher, I am aware of the power of positive reinforcement with children, but never realized how important it is to dogs. Thank you Paul Owen for giving us a pet who no longer lives in fear and can now have the life she deserves."
2,Dog Whisperer,"Seems like he showed us how to train dogs with a dog that was already trained. Didn't work on my dog at all, especially the lay down or ""down"" routine. I'm still hopeful and working at it."
3,The Dog Whisperer,"I was expecting something else. A little disappointed, but was able to use some of the tips for training our dog."
1,Not Amusing,"This DVD began with a poor quality, not humerous, non-informational cartoon. It actually frightened my dog. She hid until the cartoon was over. The title ""The Dog Whisperer"" leads one to believe that this is somehow connected with Cesar Millan, which it is not. Paul Owens techniques do not work for me and my dog. I'd be glad to give it to someone free of charge as I will never look at it again."
2,gentle ways to train your dog,"I was pleased at the methods used to train your dogs from puppy to mature dogs. IT covers several different styles of training, clicker and others. I would highly recommend it as a excellent resource in your inventory of training methods. I am using it on my 9 week old rat terrier and he will fetch, come sit and down with a little help and yes even shake hands."
2,Not to my expectations,"This DVD does not live up to my expectations. It does not go into enough detail or spend enough time on each training session. Too vague, and too elementary. I can do all of what this trainer shows by past experience with my own dogs. I would not recommend to anyone."
2,"Good information, but not enough","The training methods taught on this dvd are easy to use and work well. I just don't feel it is complete enough as far as whole training. It is basically just a dvd about training animals tricks. It doesn't train you how to house train a puppy. It also doesn't give you any ideas about training dogs on something other than what is on the dvd. The dvd also gets kind of annoying with the dogs point of view clips. Luckily you can skip these. I personally would not recommend this, but if you have an adult dog that you just want to get it to heal or sit or lay down this dvd will teach you a real quick learning technique.Something else I did like is the fact that they teach using very kind procedures toward the animals. I was able to teach my blue healer pup (Abby) to sit, lay down, come and heel in about 3 tries each. I liked the techniques, but it just seems its more of a trick dvd than a full training dvd."
1,He's no Cesar Millan,"Not at all what I expected. I was expecting something more like the training on the show Dog Whisperer. I really wish I had not wasted my money on this video. First of all there is a cave man cartoon at the beginning. Why? Secondly it is broken into tiny segments...you're hitting play every few minutes on the dvd player (annoying). And thirdly if you have an common sense, ready any dog training books or seen any dog training shows you'll know more than what this video displays. :P"
2,Redundant,"We found that any of the actual information included in this DVD was in the book-- which we read before buying the DVD. There wasn't really any additional information, no new tricks or behaviors. And the puppets and voice-overs are really annoying. Also wished that it could play all at once, as you had to keep going back to the main menu after every 2 minute segment. Pretty much a waste of money if you have the book.BUT i like his approach, and the book has come in very handy while training our adopted border collie mix."
3,A little disappointed,"I liked the positive reinforcements in this DVD, and I did get a few training tips.But I was hoping for something a little more in depth...potty training, behavior modification, etc. This video covers basics like sit, fetch, down etc. The cartoons and all are fluff and really don't add to what I was looking for....which is training my dog."
3,mis-named,"I have two very aggressive dogs and was looking for information on how to handled them. I bought this video because of the name and was disappointed to find it was the typical dog training video and is not about being a real dog whisperer. It focuses on standard techniques which can be applied if your dog is trainable. It doesn't address the pack mentality, or how to assert oneself as the alpha member with your dog(s). The dogs' psyche is not addressed nor what drives their behavior. If you have a submissive dog, the techniques in this video will be helpful. If your dog is competing with you for the alpha position you'll need another video that addresses that."
3,a mediocre dvd,"This dvd is just the tip of the ice berg, as far as training a dog is concerned. it hints at what you may need to do, and i get the feeling that i will have to buy at least half a dozen more dvds to get the full picture, so have decided that i will settle for the book!!"
1,Poor Quality DVD,"I would not recommend this DVD, very poor quality DVD and training tips are what you can find on the general internet, without purchasing. I tried to save money before investing in Cesar Milan's DVD set, but now have spent more money because I am going online to purchase Cesar's training DVD."
2,Watch section you want and skip what you don't menus,"DVD was alright. It showed you what to do, but not so much how to do it. Just enough to get you to ask more questions. Like what do I do if my dog does not do what I am telling him? How do I correct him if he does it wrong or not at all? etc. It had menus to allow you to watch just the segment you wanted. Really is not a sit down and watch all at once DVD. There are so many sections that you use the remote a lot if you want to watch all the sections. Too much fluff and not enough content. Book is better."
4,Thorough and Helpful,"Paul Owens cares so much about training dogs positively and effectively, that this DVD is a must for every dog owner. Each command we ask from our dogs is outlined here in a clear and concise manner, easy to follow and understand. As a television producer, I was impressed with the high production value of the film and fully enjoyed a surprise animated short. Paul's wealth of experience and love of dogs shines through and makes it fun and stressfree to learn how to get our dogs to do what we want them to do with positive reinforcement."
3,"A Different ""Dog Whisperer""","First, some clarification: I thought I was buying a Cesar Milan DVD, because the ""author"" is only listed as ""Dog Whisperer"" - I should have read the reviews :o(That said, the DVD is very informative, BUTI didn't really need a cartoon or ""dogs-eye"" view; I would rather have seen information on crate training or housebreaking a new pup, instead.Finally, choosing between the TWO ""dog whisperers"" re: training techniques isn't a question of force v. positive reinforcement! The two approach dog training from totally different perspectives! This DVD is geared for working with calmer, non-neurotic, non-aggressive and/or non-fearful dogs and puppies; Milan works with ""red zone"" dogs: agressive, neurotic, or fearful alpha dogs, rehabilitating them.In my opinion, there is a place for both approaches."
1,adult instruction mixed with childrens entertainment - unfortunately,"I bought Paul Owens book, The Puppy Whisperer, and I was very impressed; so much so that I ordered this DVD to further my knowledge on dog/puppy training before I find a new puppy to adopt. I must say however, that overall I am not impressed with the DVD.In a effort to make this a family friendly experience, this DVD is chuck full of bad animations, puppet shows and horribly amateurish dog voice-overs that would only appeal to the youngest kids. Granted, there is some very very helpful information here, but you have to navigate around the mind-numbing pre-school silliness to find it. Case in point: the teaching hand gestures section is demonstrated by a homemade muppet.My suggestion to Mr. Owens would be to make this into two DVD's; one for adults who to benefit from your obvious wisdom and professional instruction -- then make a second one to entertain the kids."
1,The WORST dog training dvd ever,I purchased this dvd based on other reviews and the title which sounded like what I needed. It is filled with childish animation and the small parts of the dvd devoted to training are equally childish. I learned NOTHING from this dvd and I hope I can strongly discourage anyone else from making the same mistake and waste of money.
2,Not at all what I expected,Training technique does not work very well. Beware...this DVD is not by Caesar Milan (from the Dog Whisperer show on National Geographic channel). Caesar has a book and video coming out in March or April...save your money for that.
1,Treater not Whisperer,This is one of the most inane and worthless training programs that I ever participated in or watched. He doesn't whisper he continually gives treats. I guess the dogs obey because they get fat and complacent. Not a Cesar Milan. Save your money until you can afford a Cesar tape
1,No opinion,I never received the item. But they were very prompt in refunding my money when I alerted them to that fact.
1,"This guy doesn't even know how to talk to a dog, let alone whisper","*phew* This was a doozy. The only thing I learned from this DVD was how Amazon's return policy works. I laughed my way through the entire thing. The guy sure talks alot, but if you watch closely most of the dogs are on a leash and they are CONSTANTLY fed treats. You feel as if he ever runs out all choas will ensue.I was excited to see ""Dog Baseball"" until I realized it consisted of putting dog treats on bases - and he described this as a game to wean your dog of treats.There were some half assed puppets thrown in and some really crappy animation.Overall, if you are looking for a DVD to simply rest your coffee on, it's highly recommended."
1,Useless,"The way this video is set up with menus upon menus makes it virtually useless. Whatever information it contains is difficult to access because of the menus. What information I watched was mediocre and elementary at best, and the frustrating menus for less than five minutes of DVD play time per selection was finally to much. It was a waste of money. I finally tossed this DVD and went out to play with my dog.If you want a video game, get a video game.If you want an easy to use and view dog training DVD, avoid this one."
2,Don't do it.,"This DVD is very basic and only covers the basic commands. Could be useful if you have a puppy but a basic puppy class will teach you the same stuff. I like his style for sure, but I can't really recommend this DVD as the content is extremely limited. It's really not worth the money."
4,Very good!,"I really like this basic training video- the training sections are excellent; concise and to the point~ easy to learn. This fellow is an intelligent, talented teacher- eminently endearing, and the overall quality of the production is great. I wish I lived close enough to take lessons from him.I'd have given this 5 stars but for some of the dog voice-over segments were kind of annoying (I did like Frenchie, tho) and perhaps the actual points being made could have been done more clearly in a less ""cute"" fashion. The animated segment was not necessary for me, but artistically impressive and lightly amusing. It unfolded a bit too slowly so I was waiting more than once for the shoe to drop. I loved the gal and her hip action! I'd recommend this training dvd to friends with a new dog, and I'd buy it again."
3,Easy dog training,"This video was simple to understand but really for beginning training and not intermediate. While the training worked on my puppy to obey simple commands such as sit and lay down, he is beyond that and into intermediate training such as walking and not jumping. This book did not cover that type of training, it is basic simple sit, lay, come commands."
2,not what I expected,"This was not what I expected, the information was too basic, it did not provide anything new, I do not recommend it."
1,Umm not good at all,I got itin the mail excited and I opened it up and took out the DVD opened it to find a freakin farm animal DVD but they took care of it so I guess it's fine
4,Very enjoyable Christian Music.,"I love this artist's soulful singing. My least favorite songs on the cd are ""I Was Born To Love You"" and ""Straight and Narrow"". I very much enjoy all the others. I wish this artist would release more cds."
1,expensive junk,"This thing plain does not work. the first day we opened the box they worked as long as we were within 6 inches of the lost keys or remote control, but by the next day they didn't work at all. If we fiddled with them for an hour we could get them to work temporarily but a couple hours later they didn't work again so when an item was actually lost this system was useless. I could have tried to resell them on amazon, but I would have felt too guilty selling such a worthless product, so I just threw it away."
1,Waste of Money-Rating of 1 Star is 1 Star to Many,"I would not consider buying this product. Received this Smart Find Plus from my daughter for Christmas a few years ago. Should have returned it to Brookstone immediately and got a refund of $60. It worked inconsistantly and than did not work at all with any of the remotes. The remotes for the tv remote controls were attached so well that you cannot remove them without breaking them. How this product made it through quality control, does not say much for Brookstone and their products. Called Brookstone today, and they were of no help what so ever. I thought maybe there was a simple fix until I read the reviews of those with identical experiences. Best use of the product would be in The Landfil with all the rest of them and I believe Brookstone would agree."
2,If there was an Oscar for the MOST RIDICULOUS ENDING EVER...,"This film would have got one as 1 + 1 is 2! The plot is predictable, but even then, the end of this boring story is hard to digest. So perfectly sweet I felt nauseous.Besides, a little bit of originality wouldn't do harm to anybody, especially to viewers. It's yet another copy of ""My best friend's wedding"", but this time with gay couple in the picture.Acting, as usual in such enterprises, is not the strongest part. I really don't know if there is one role played well from a to z..."
4,What a find :),"I love this album. It's surprisingly good for a newer band, and I'm rockin' out to Starry Eyed as I fight traffic everyday now. Great riffs, hooks and extremely singable. 5 Star Iris is absolutely worth the price of admission, anyway you can get them. I'm just sorry I found out about them after they did the concerts out here in the west (that sound you hear is me banging my head on the wall :)"
1,Legalized theft,"One dollar + $4.99 in shipping? Are you kidding?? I tried putting in 10 as the order number, and the shipping multiplied by 10 as well, to $49.90. This is truly heinous -- Amazon, why are you perpetrating this?"
1,the worst thing ever !!!!,when i put my camra in it it fit and all then i picked it up and it broke and it broke the camra to!!!
2,Weak,"Maybe my expectations were too high, having read that this book was compared with ""Get Shorty"". Lankford is no Leonard - not even close.This story contained an uninteresting plot, unsympathetic characters, and weak prose. For example, the protaganist mentions that the process of developing a movie is boring and tedious, then proceeds to spend 50 pages narrating every detail of the process.I finished the book - it was good enough for that - but I wish I hadn't spent the time buying it."
2,Cheap,I didnt put heavy shoes ..and I bought two ..I also put shoes I seldom used in there to avoid constant opening and closing..they didnt last long..scrap wood now
5,"Sadly, this was the first recording of Beethoven's concerto","...that I ever heard. And it spoiled me for life. I have, consequently, always regarded the first movement as the singularly most beautiful melody I've ever heard. And Heifitz is magnificent."
5,AbFab,"Of the cornucopia of classical music I've pruchased over the years, this recording of Jascha Heifetz blows them all away. He has the clearest tone of any violinist I've ever heard. He shines on Mendelssohn's Allegro non troppo and on the final movement of Beethoven's concerto. I highly recomend this work."
3,Definitely not the Best,"I agree with Mr. Melson, who is below me.A fine performance of these works but there's better ones out there. Read Mr. Melson review---my thoughts are the same."
3,the sound quality is really bad,"the hiss and pop is too much. I guess this is inevitable for such an old record. But you just can't put it in a high-end audio system which will brutally reveal all these flaws.otherwise the perform is great, hence the 3-star."
3,Very sentimental but still worthwhile,This tape was my first experience of the Chicken Soup series. I had heard of Mark Victor Hansen from the One Minute Millionaire book.The first thing that struck me was how awfully - there's only one way to put this - American the tape is. Beneath the slightly patronising (perhaps only to non-American ears) delivery the stories are indeed worthwhile even though some suffer from being over-sentimental.Recommended.
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!,"I love this book very much. I guess you could call it my favorite one. I am 14 years old and deal with a lot of hard things and your books really help me. I have heard stories from it at camps, at school, and at church. Sometimes when something is bothering me I look in there to see if anyone else has this problem and i can see how they handled it. Your book has really helped me through my teens eventhough I am just becoming one. I would recomend that yall get more publicity for your books so that other people can find them and get help like I did. Thank you so much for writting it, It is great. sincerely Blakeley (Mobile, Alabama)"
5,A moving and uplifting book that gets you hooked!,This is an excellent book for the workplace. It is nice and refreshing to read if you are feeling down about work. I've begun to retell the stories at my workplace and everyone loves the stories. This is great reading for a coffee break.
2,Could use a pinch of Rosemary and spice ...,"First of all, just to get things off of my chest (and believe you me, I usually LOVE getting everything off of my chest right off the bat!) Item! Jack Canfield is an excellent and gifted motivational writer. Golly, he has motivated me to write a review, right? However, this time around old Jack's soup could use a little salt or herbage to his advice. If you ask anyone where I work, I am always promoting Chicken Soup for the Soul stories however I didn't find these all that courageous or creative. I mean, what is creative or daring about a woman who builds an entire miniature of her office environment in her cubicle using Beanie Babies for each of her coworkers. And what bigger point was Jack trying to point out about the manager who tried to motivate his daily reports by having them act out scenes from ""A Room With a View"" before they started their shift each day? Kind of lost me this time, Mr Canfield!"
1,Very disappointing; nowhere near as good as rest of series,"I'm a huge fan of the Chicken Soup books, and bought them all (even the Jewish, although I'm Christian, the prisoner's, although no one I know has ever been arrested, etc.). However, this one just arrived, but is already packed to be returned. I skimmed it, but was horribly disappointed. The stories all appeared long-winded (actually, verbose), boring, and non-inspiring. Although the other books are all wonderful to read and reread over and over again, containing countless inspirational stories (many short enough to print out and frame, and virtually all worthy of displaying on one's wall), these weren't even worth wading through the first time. I hate to say it, but this one seems to have been written solely to make a buck, padding out the most boring experiences to compile a book.They aren't inspirational and aren't interesting -- period."
4,I like it,This cd is okay but the groove did not hit me as hard as expatriape. Even still I find Dillon's music on this CD awe-inspiring.
3,not used,"Got this for a reference guild and training material. However, I never really used it and when I had questions it was easier to Google it for a solution."
4,A Title for My Review,"Since this review has to be at least 20 words long, I may have to stretch it out a bit. I like the book a lot. I am only on Chapter four, though. Come back in a month."
4,MCSA/MCSE Self-Pace Training Kit (Exam 70-270),It goes in better depth with hands on labs to work with while you learn or fine tune for the test.
4,Helped me pass...,"I used this book as my primary study source to successfully pass the Microsoft 70-270 exam. While the book is thorough in some areas, it lacks in others, such as IIS, which is needed for the exam.If you don't have experience with Windows XP in a domain environment, I suggest an additional source to use with this one. Microsoft exams are tough. The questions are tricky and lengthy. I would recommend everyone join one of the excellent certification forums online as an additional resource.With that said, the book contains few mistakes. And the Measure Up practice tests that come with the book are very helpful."
5,Very interesting Book,"Well, this book is very interesting and in great detail. 100% good for those who want to pass the M70-270 exam"
3,Purchase review,"Over all service was good, only problem was the damage to the books binding will shorten the life of the book."
1,not good,this book is very dry. the book merely guides you to do alot of steps. it does not explain the specifications.don't believe me? read the book and try to take the measure up exam and see how you do. i learned more from the exam questions than the dry book
3,"MCSA/MCSE Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-270): Installing, Configuring, and Administering Microsoft Windows XP Professional, S",O.KALOT OF SAME MATERAIL REPEATED OVER AND OVERGOOD FOR A BEGINNER
3,dissapointed,"this book was supposed to be the definitive exam guide.after reading it cover to cover i am a dissapointed.1. there are a few factual(trivial but still...) errors.2. the book progression is flawed, the first chapter(xp instalatn) for example refer constantly to concepts and procedures not yet learned and assume that you already now them. these concepts, terms and procedres are explained further on other chapters, but in my opinion it would have been better to start with basics and progress deeper.3. at places the information is LESS then what is required in the exam.over all though its a detailed book , but one that should have been better proof read and better planned"
2,Be careful,"I am rating this book base off the relevance of the exam. This book is not tailored for the exam. It is more tailored for people who really don't have understanding of XP at all. Trust me, I took the test base solely on content of this book, and I was lost. A-lot, again A-lot of information was not covered. If you don't believe me, read this book, then try picking up an up to date 270 Exam Cram book, and you will instantly see miss information that was not covered in this book.You have been warn."
2,Misleading Information,"Good book to just ""pass"" the exam. If you're really into learning the right way of doing things this book blows. This book is filled with information that is not correct and really will make you more confused when you try it out. Remeber that ""best practices"" help you pass the exam, but they do not teach you anything for the real world. I would go with the Sybex 270 personally. Much better."
3,It's a good book but...,"I did pass my exam but needed more than just this book that it's why I'm giving this book 3 stars, but still a great buy."
4,QUEENS OF HIP-HOP FICTION,"THESE ARE THE 3 OF THE MOST INFAMOUS FEMALE AUTHORS OUT THERE!!! THEY PUT THREE VERY GOOD STORIES TOGETHER. BUT HANDS DOWN TO KASHAMBA AND NIKKI, THEY DID WHAT THEY DO BEST, AINT NO DENYING THAT!!!!KASHAMBA'S STORY WAS REALLY DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING I EVER READ, SO I GAVE HER STORY ALONE 5 STARS. I REALLY ENJOYED IT!!!NIKKI'S STORY, WHICH IS A LIL SEQUEL FROM UNIQUE'S STORY IN ""GIRLS FROM THE HOOD 1"" WAS FIYA, I GAVE IT 4 STARS.JOY'S STORY WAS OK, I ENJOYED HERS ALSO, BUT IT WAS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT COMING FROM JOY, BUT IT WAS GOOD. I GAVE IT 3 STARS.TARAYAONE!COAST 2 COAST READERS (C~2~C)"
1,Didnt match description of story lines,"None of the stories match the story lines on the website. Read a little of the first story and all I can say is that the girl had low self-esteem, dumb, naive, and stupid. Couldnt she see that dude was playing her and even when she found out she still was trying to mess with him. WOW is all I can say"
1,Read carefully!!,"Though the picture for this item includes 3 sieves, all the copy uses the word ""sieve"" in the singular. And that is what you will receive. Just one for $5.19, though the sieve arrived with a price sticker of $1.95. Beware the rip-off!"
3,small sand sieves,"Bought these to find shark teeth. Although they are very sturdy and work great, they are small. Thought I was getting something much bigger."
3,Eh...,Korn is a great band but it wasnt their best performance. They did a cool cover for One but they didn't play the whole song. Its not worth buying. buy their cds instead.
3,Korn after Untouchables.,"I'm a huge Korn fan. This dvd is cool. The stage and show is fine. But the venue is dark, I like gigs such as Woodstock in the day, festival type of atmosphere. I actually liked Untouchables a lot. The songs come accross fine here. Only drawbacks are, David Silveria seems to have less power, perhaps after his injury. And Jon Davis' voice is not as good as he's been in the past. Maybe a bad day for them. But the performances from 1999 were of higher quality. Thus I give this 3 stars. It's worth owning, but the older gigs are tighter."
4,GREAT BUT NOT PERFECT...,"I am a huge Korn fan, so I went out and bought this DVD right when it came out. I love watching Korn live. They are probably my favorite live act, considering I have seen them live 5 times so far and every show has been amazing. They play a lot of great songs. Yes most of them are their singles, but oh well, all those songs are great.What I did not like about this DVD is the ridiculous amount of camera changes and some of those unnecessary special effects they throw in, but hey that's not the bands fault; so don't rip on Korn for it. Another thing is that Jon voice was a little weak on some songs... but I understand because it was Korn's first show in a long time, and Jon wasn't in his top form.But other than that I love this DVD because I love watching Korn live, because they put on a great show every time. So if you are a Korn fan you will love this DVD despite the camera changes, etc. So go out and get it if you don't already have it!"
4,Damn Good,"Fantastic DVD, makes me crave seeing another live Korn performance. Only reason i've not made it a 5 star rating is that i was expecting just a great live show, this DVD has special effects added into the concert which don't get me wrong isn't a bad thing, i just didn't expect it. I would say its another great addition to my Korn collection and its worth having."
3,"Not bad, but not worth buying.","The problem with this DVD is that if you have seen any other Korn concert videos/specials, you've seen this one. All of the typical hits are here, nothing we haven't seen before. Although the band is in top form and everything sounds nice, it just gets boring and tiring because we've all seen this before (Like we haven't seen 'Got The Life' or 'Blind' performed three-dozen times already). This is pretty much an extended version of the special that aired on MTV over the summer. The concert itself was broadcast over the nation in certain theaters on June 10th, 2002 to celebrate the impending release of 'Untouchables.' It's worth a viewing, but as a Korn fan, I found that one time was more than enough. Just buy a ticket or settle for the much better, more interesting, and much more satisfying Family Values 98 video."
2,he can be better,"I think this DVD is not great because the sound [isn't very good]. The voice of Jonathan Davis [isn't very good] and not mixed great.The 5.1 sound is a joke and dont work propedly because the sound mixer of Korn is a newbie i thinkBut The song on this Dvd is so sweet, we can listen new tracks like here to stay and old track like falling away from meBut the worst thing on this DvD is the voice of j. Davis, this guy cant sing good on all songs.The worst song on the Dvd is Thoughtless. All the musician [isn't very good] onb this track and the songs look like an imitation of the real by a no talented band.But if you really like the band and dont know anything in music buy this DVD."
3,An Okay Concert,"This concert DVD of Korn was just about okay. They are pretty heavy and if you enjoy hard rock, this shall please you. Alot of there songs do sound the same with the same riffs, so if you like variety, you may be dissapointed. And also, Korn is by no means metal. If you are looking for something in the metal genre, look somewhere else."
2,When Will This End?!,"I borrowed this DVD from my friend, who got held back in high school. As I went through it, I noticed something very strange and familiar. Most of Korn's fans are kids. Mostly kids buy their cd's. Jonathan Davis always sings about crap that happened to him when he was a kid. I then turned off the DVD when to go for a walk and ponder my maturity. I think Korn needs to grow up. I mean, they still put out good material, but they need a new quality to appeal to. I have their self-titled album as well as Follow The Leader. Why are two-discs necessary?!"
4,I have some mixed feelings about this one,"I debated for some time on whether or not to give this DVD three stars or four stars. Consider my rating as a weak four star.The audio quality is quite good as well as the visuals. The lead singer's voice is weak at times, but, overall, he does sound good and pulls off some fun vocal ranges.The editor gets a little carried away with the post production effects, and the editing is a little frenetic at times.Nonetheless, here's the bottom line - I enjoyed the DVD. I cranked up the sound system and really had fun watching and listening to the performance; and, more times than not, I enjoyed the effects that were added in."
4,Bad night for an amazing band,"I like to think that i am one of Korn's most divoted fans. Yet on this dvd they probably took Korn's worst live show ever, and worst of all they released it to the public. Jon's voice and Jon physically were not ready for this show. You could tell blantantly on ""Thoughtless"" and on ""Make Me Bad""; however whose ever idea in the band to do ""One"" was brillant, the way they meshed Make Me Bad, One, and Justin together was just breathtaking almost. I would've liked to see more bonus material, but I guess Deuce has enough of that to go around."
3,CHEAP PUNK,"Ten largely unknown punk bands, two songs a piece and a bonus uncredited version of ""Walk Like An Egyptian"" make up this compilation from 1998 by Hopeless Records. These tracks too often sound like they're coming from the same band of loud aggressive vocals and garage punk musicians but there are some distinct outstanding moments. Amsterdam's ""Funeral Oration's"" two contributions have some great hardcore pop hooks and sound like refreshed early ""Smiths"" singles minus Morrisey's efeminacy. ""Against All Authority"" adds a brass influence to its heavy guitars and drums creating an eerie punk marriage of ska and metal. Permanently etched on the back cover of the CD is the price quote in the tradition of indie/punk music. It's certainly worth it's cheap price."
3,"'Hopelessly Devoted To You Too, Volume 2' (Hopeless Records) Various Artists","Remember purchasing this CD sampler for $2 of lesser-known punk bands several years ago when I saw Against All Authority open for G.B.H. believe it was. Total of twenty-one tracks to lure us to run out and buy CD's by the up & coming (most of them never went anywhere) of bands like the previously mentioned Against All Authority, the Queers, 88 Fingers Louie, Mustard Plug and Digger."
3,Hit songs - just not the Hit versions by Hit artisits,"It's hard to believe how many hits Burt Bacharach has written. This collection contains 60 of his ""greatest hits"". I use parentheses, while all the songs here were hits for Bacharach, they are not all the hit versions of those songs. Most of us know the Dionne Warwick version of ""I'll never fall in love"", instead we have Bobbie Gentry singing it here. Is this a bad thing? No necessarily. However, it may make you yearn for the hit maker versions."
2,Dissatisfied,"I have two cats - one 4 years old and one is 18 years old. They wouldn't eat these. The pieces were too large and too difficult to cut. They expect their treats and these just made them walk away. Thankfully, my dog liked them so they didn't go to waste."
3,listen to Aventura and skip the Elvis Martinez tracks...,"I bought this album for Aventura ONLY. I hadn't even heard of Elvis Martinez. The first track, Directo Al Corazon, sounded nasily and flat (Elvis Martinez), and it really didn't pop for me. The Aventura tunes are a whole different story though. From CUANDO VOLVERAS, to AMOR BONITO, to ALEJANDRA, and finally EL CORO DOMINICANO (which is more of a merengue, by the way), these guys know how to blend, make you swoon and leave you feeling romantic. Now, that is what I call bachata.*Note: The album alternates Elvis Martinez with Aventura.*Disfrutalo!"
2,cute but fragile,i love how the seatcovers look but after one day the stiching started to tear and run. i wouldnt recommend buying them.
2,"Good music, but not the power of a Broadway show","Many of the reviews written seem to be by people who've performed the show or seen it at a regional theater. I've never seen the show, but have listened to many musicals. This does not have the great vocal performances I've come to expect with recent musicals.I've listened to other Schwartz musicals and with Children found the music average and the vocal performances weak. Don't get me wrong, Stephanie Mills can sing, but she doesn't have the music to show her talents here. The only song with any real power is ""Lost In The Wilderness"". It's the one reminiscent a Broadway-type of song. The singer is great!Most of the songs I would consider nice, but boring. There is no need to get the double box set if you just want to hear a taste of the musical. This is not to say the other reviewers were wrong in their thoughts; it's a great family show, a simple soundtrack for kids, and well written. It's just not a powerful musical with show-stopping performances."
2,Compared to London Cast,"The Original London Cast Recording of Children of Eden is the best, and the only one that I listen to now. The artist on the London give the show a certain darkness and depth and electricity that is just lacking in this recording. The Father on this CD is nothing compared to Ken Page of Cats. Eve is definatley not as good a Shezwey Powell. Adam is good, but Martin Smith was phenomenal. And the duet version of Generations I can't approave of."
5,WOW!,"What an amazing musical! This is what introduced me to Stephen Schwartz, and I absolutely love him now! Though I haven't heard all of his musicals, I would have to say, of the ones I have, this is his best! Powerful, stunning, dramatic, emotional, captivating and amazing are just some words I can think of off the top of my head to describe this show. The music is fantastic and very emotional. Some songs still make some of my friends cry and they have heard them numerous times. I really wish that this show would be more popular. But unfortunately, it's success was cut back by the events in the Gulf with Sadaam and every one, as are shows now after the 9/11 thing. Stephen Sondheim's ""Assasins"" never opened due to those events and Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""By Jeeves"" closed after only about a couple months due to thos events. But this musical is one of my favorites and I hope you grow to love it as much as I do. I would deffinately reccomend this."
4,A Heavenly New Musical,I had the intense privelege of portraying Eve in the Long Island premiere of COE and I must say that this is a truly transcendent musical. This is not just another Bible musical...Stephen Schwartz truly has something new to say about the first few chapters of the Good Book. With soaring melodies and a bunch of songs that are just plain fun to listin to and even grander to sing...COE is one of those new musicals that proves that just cause it's not on Broadway doesn't mean it's not worthwhile...listin and enjoy!!!
4,"Great music, so what if its not ""Broadway""?","I have not been in this show, but I have sung some of the songs from it (most notable ""Lost in the Wilderness"" in a recent concert and ""In whatever time we have"") and this is great stuff.(...) If you want homogenous, boring, typically and unerringly ""broadway"" music, then see something old. Shouldn't we be looking for music that doesn't fit the mold? I agree that this show won;t make it to broadway, but thats not for musical reasons. stephen schwartz may not be the most original or greatest of composers, but this is still good stuff and few people writing musicals these days are actually original. I'm not a huge fan of the synthesized sound, but its the music thats on trial here. Buy this CD if you want interesting biblical music and some great voices. If you want to here Hello Dolly...then BUY hello dolly. Its that simple."
1,Not enough bad to say,"i got about halfway through this cd when i purchased it (at full price!) when i became super mad. see, i was expecting songs that were kind of interesting, or clever, or sounded at all different from each other. i was expecting at least ONE memorable tune. i was expecting songs that advanced the show along. instead, i got this: ""Let there be Let there be Let there be Let there be Let there be Let there be"" and ""And the next day was perfect And the next day was perfect And the next day was perfect And the next day was perfect And the next day was perfect...""you get the idea."
2,"Great voices, horriffic score","I'm all for a great bible-based musical, but the unresolving dissinence in this score makes for a troubling two hours of anything but listening pleasure. If you're out to produce or hear a great musical of this genre, try GODSPELL, another Schwartz score. That, on the contrary to this recording, doesn't sound a bit synthesized, and remains interesting and upbeat for the entire duration. The only redeeming factor for this horrifically compiled recording is the voice of Stephanie Mills, who originated the role of Dorothy in the production of THE WIZ. Her voice can bring magic to any stage, and believe me -- this stage needs some serious magic."
2,Dissapointed at the quality,"I was looking forward to having this album on CD because it's a favorite. However, the quality of sound is extremely poor. It sounds very muffled and unprofessional. I'm disappointed at the quality. In considering purchasing this CD, you really have to weigh out if it's worth it to you to deal with the poor sound quality in order to just listen to the wonderful Clark Sisters sing or to just forget about it, because the sound just isn't worth the money. The purchaser must decide."
2,"Music: SO EXCELLENT, Production: WORST I EVER HEARD!!!!!!!!!","The Original's could-not have had this Bad a sound Quality. I would say the Blame go's to ""Sounds of Gospel Records, who OBVIOUSLY could not have cared less about their work on this re-release. TOO-BAD, the Music is a MUST-HAVE! HEY, I bought it. Just thought I'd let you know the TRUTH.(Scotty knows good music!"
4,"Ok , Not the greatest quality, but WOW!","I bought this CD and the other Clark re-release. Now granted these other folks are right about the sound quality, but it actually makes the music carry a little bit more, which is kinda cool. I love the music and, personally, the quality could be much worse. The quality, actually, puts you back in the 80s, when this stuff was made, or so I think. And it doesn't hold back how powerful the ladies' voices were. The first track alone is worth buying the CD. Go ahead, buy the CD! It will uplift you and make you feel good!"
2,Extremely disappointed-quality is TERRIBLE!,"I bought this even AFTER reading the other reviews about the quality-I know, shame on me! But I LOVED this album when it came out and listened to it daily while in college. After receiving the CD, I have to tell you that the tape I made from the original album over 12 years ago sounds better than this-cracks and all. The ladies sound like chipmonks, totally distorting the quality of their voices, which is so sad as their voices are beautiful. The tempo actually sounds faster if that is possible. I gave the rating a 2 only because it's the Clark Sisters-otherwise, I would have rated in with a 1. I won't listen to the CD, I'll use the tape I have and ""settle"" for that. Too bad!!! Definitely don't waste your time!!!"
1,very poor,"this CD is absolutely the worst sound quality i have ever heard from a CD, I've had 45rpm records back in the day that sounded better! sounds like maybe they put a microphone in front of a speaker! i bought the original album and also 12 inch of ""you brought the sunshine"" when they were first released, the voices were crisp, the highs were high, the bottom end was substantial but this! i was extremely disappointed. maybe instead of the master tape the had an old cassette that somebody recorded played it through something and put a microphone in front the speaker it's that bad and i think the price was 15 or 18 dollars WOW!!!!"
4,Worth every penny,"I have been trying for some time to locate this cd. I am so blessed to have found this cd, granted, the quality sounds interferes a little but the cd is worth every penny and more"
4,Great new music!,"Modjo is the British duo who stormed the UK charts earlier this year with this debut single, which spent two weeks at the #1 position. This little disco-house number samples Chic's ""Soup for One"" -- how can you go wrong sampling one of the greatest disco acts of all time! Well this is one of the first big male-vocal dance hits of the year, and it's about time that it saw a release in the United States--on MCA Records, no less! The only downside is that it contains only four versions, but they are good ones -- including one acoustic version to get dance haters hooked on the song. It also contains the video on the enhanced portion of the CD. Good stuff! Great to be released here in the states!"
4,Will be a big hit!,"Although I've yet to hear this song in the U.S., if you've ever been to Rio you'll know this is a staple at most clubs. Solid beat, different than most techno, and will probably be a big hit in the States on the club scene. If you have not heard it yet you most certainly will."
3,Unlovable...,"I have enjoyed the author's previous books ""A Falcon's Heart"" and ""This Dangerous Magic"" but I just could not like this one. The Middle Ages is one of my favorite periods, especially when the author is able to convey a feeling of realism to the story. This was not the case for ""Wicked Charms."" The hero was too arrogant and narcissistic to be likable, while the heroine, was too cought up in her own ""made up"" problems to really make an impact. Also, the fact that she sounded like a modern woman made it difficult to imagine she was actually from the 12th century. I was never able to get into this book, barely finishing it. If you are a fan of Bertrice Small, Patricia Ryan, or Elizabeth Chadwick; SKIP this one."
1,no knight in shining armor.....,"like the other reviewer-the ""hero"" of this book threw me off it-I quit about 60 pages in.A truly unlikeable male lead. This knight, who is also of wizard blood-is vain, arrogant, controlling and cruel. He has no problem with going to Scotland, taking over a castle, nearly killing three young boys when he first gets there, threatening to hang any scottish person who vandalizes his property, throwing out the dead crusaders betrothed and her toddler-until he sees her, of course, then he decides he'll keep her around for a ""tup"", then, in his words, send her on her way!?!I like reading medievels-and do not mind the knight who must be hard on the battlefield. But everyone wants a knight to be honorable off it-and this one definately not.1 star for a slew of truly unlikeable characters that make this book pretty much unreadable for me."
1,Music for People Who Don't Really Like Classical Music,"The music of Alain Lefevre, played here by the composer who is a reasonably well-known competition-winning pianist, is perhaps one or two steps up from the mush of the likes of Yanni or John Tesh. It belongs on the Windham Hill label. Lots of arpeggios, lots of Alberti basses, lots of slow tremolos, lots of unblemished triads, lots of conjunct melodies that immediately go out of one's memory. Further, Lefevre's playing is rather trudging.This is not even superior lounge music. Unless this sort of pap is your cuppa, give this one a miss.Scott Morrison"
4,The best Queers EP,"The Queers most short-lived lineup (Joe Queer plus a few New Hampshire highschool kids) produced four awesome songs that make this the best of the many Queers EP's out there. The first song is an alternate version of Punk Rock Confidential superhit Everything's OK, which has a different second verse. Secondly is Queerbait, a nice, fast, new song with a lot of attitude. Next comes Get a Life and Live It Loser, a kick-ass song kept from full length album release until Pleasant Screams arrives in April 2002. Lastly, is an alternative version of the Queers' cover of Banana Split's catchy song I Enjoy Being a Boy. This EP has a good mix of love and attitude songs, be sure to pick it up!"
1,Dead inside a week.,Dead inside a week and not even with daily use. I believe I got about six hours total use out of this... item. Save your money. I will not be buying any further iKross products.
2,"Works OK, However...","This set of speakers and Cradle works ok, however..The speakers are very tinny sounding, which is probably normal considering the price. The real drawback is it has no HotSync button so in order to hotsync you have to use the on screen button of the phone itself.In my case that means picking the whole thing up, using the screen while it is installed in the Cradle, then setting it back down carefully when it starts connecting. Kind of a pain in the you know what."
5,Nubia Revisted,"This recently re-released CD, formerly available under the title ""Escalay: the Water Wheel"" features three of Hamza el-Din's greatest performances. Drawing firmly upon his lively and exotic Nubian background, Hamza weaves it together with his natural gift for playing the oud (an istrument of Arab rather than Nubian origin). This CD is unlike anything you have ever heard before. Although there are many similarities with other Middle Eastern and African styles (due to shared history and cultures from Egypt to Ethiopia) it is still unique and beautiful. Check it out."
5,"Wonderful palying, good recording","I had this record years ago, and thought the water wheel was a very hypnotic and earthy tune. Now, i have the disk, and the sound quaility is quite good for a recording so old."
4,Bad ...,"in an attempt to expand my musical horizions, i have been buying cds in the Explorer Series. This is one of my favorites. It is very mellow and very powerful, it comes highly recommended."
5,From the Kingdom of Sweden,"Probably one of the best techno mixes i've gotten in years. Most mix cds i'll play through and kind of shelf after a couple of months--this one i keep coming back to. The track selection is very good, taking the mix through a wide variety of techno styles from melodic to tribal to bangin to minimal etc. The mixing, while nothing flashy, is very smooth and pretty much flawless and displays a true ear of how to work the tracks together (probably the most impressive demonstration of that i've heard in a long long time, actually). If you're a head you definetely need to pick this one up."
5,Wonderful,If I had it to do over I would buy it again. It calms my mind and nerves with the sound of his voice and the music he sings. I hope to see more of James Taylor in concert on DVD. If you like James Taylor - You will love Pull Over.Betty Miletich
5,Pull over and buy this DvD!!,"If you have the beacon DvD Then you ""REALLY"" Need this one! ther are not many of the classics on the beacon concert but on this one, the hits of old abound! While Becon is good it lacks many great songs,Sweet baby james, Only one, Frozen man,Millworker, and many others ...There all here on this dvd and its fantastic!! James taylor is the greatest singer songwriter ever and he just keeps on proving it over and over again! I saw the pull over tour twice once in ma, at greatwoods and also at jones beach new york, outstanding.Buy it!!!!!!"
3,Better At The Beacon,"I have had this since XMAS but I prefer the Live at the Beacon (which I have had for about 18mths) because of the sound and picture quality as well as the atmosphere. As the previous reviewer pointed out unless you are a die hard JT fan or you want to hear more of the new material I would not bother with this one.If you Haven't got ""Live at the Beacon"" yet - order it and forget this."
2,What happend to JT?,"JT is a real great singer and songwriter. And since ""Live at the beacon theater"" (DVD here, best music DVD I know), I know, he's an overwhelming (LIVE!, see below) performer. ""Pull Over"" contains 80% the same stuff as the beforem mentionend DVD, and add a couple of new sounds - just the right dose of new age / world music aroma.BUT: Something strange happened with Pull Over. Music and pictures are often not synchronized. In fact I am afraid we partially do not see what we hear. It looks manipulated, and I'm afraid it is. This is even true in the ""just man with guitar"" part at the end. I just can't believe the great JT has seen this DVD himself."
3,I had to close my eyes to enjoy!,"I had a difficult time rating this DVD. The audio is a 5, no question about it.However, the video drove me crazy! I simply couldn't believe how many times the camera cut from one view to another. There are several songs in which the camera never lingers for more than one second at a time for the entire song. One second! It was extremely distracting and thoroughly interfered with my ability to enjoy the songs. It was as though the film editor was playing with a new toy.How ironic - I had to close my eyes to enjoy this DVD."
4,"Vintage James Taylor, But?","I found that James Taylor's latest DVD ""Pull Over"" Is loaded with many of his hits and songs that promote his latest cd ""October Road"". This is a fine concert with great picture and sound and I recommend this to any fan who does not own a Taylor DVD. However, if you own ""James Taylor Live At The Beacon"" I see no reason to purchase this edition unless you are hardcore JT fan. The Dvd format which is a fantastic medium for concert and digital sound has caused record companies to release live concerts one after another by the same artist to $cash$ in because they know loyal fans will buy everything they put out. Take my word for it and that is, If you have the Beacon DVD [which is fantastic] you will not need ""Pull Over"" unless you like duplication?"
4,Not bad but Beacon is better,"This is the second James Taylor concert I am aware of that is available on DVD. If you are a James Taylor fan (I am) you should buy both this and ""Live at the Beacon Theatre"" because you will appreciate the different performances. If you are a casual listener of James you should choose the Beacon Theatre disk.If you are an audiophile or care about sound quality, this one is ok but not great. It sounds like it went through a significant amount of electronic processing. The sound from the Beacon Theatre recording is much, much better. That is strong competition though as the Beacon recording is probably the best sounding DVD I own."
4,System shock in paperback,"I've bought the second part of this trilogy from a bookstand at a street market. I've hunted down the third in a dusty ""second hand""-shelf in a forgotten bookstore. And currently I'm trying to seduce an old, ugly hag of a public library manager into selling me the first one, which started this hunt a couple of years ago. This one is a must-have for all who enjoy good sci-fi, and also a helluva read for everyone else. A mesmerizing dark future setting, a really coherent intrigue, heavy-duty warfare and lots of characters you care for (which the author doesn't really do, the way they get kicked around:-) will keep you awake at night. Agreeing with my precedessors: mail the publisher. Buy them, if you are Rockefeller, or intimidate them, if you are with the CIA. Help them if you're a brain surgeon- they need their heads fixed, for this one is a potential bestseller."
5,Fantastic,"I recommend every sci-fi fan should read the trilogy. A masterful intertwining of music; especially rock, technology, politics and action. The story is driven by the powerful personalities of the rag tag band of guerrilla fighters of the New Resistance, struggling against all odds to save the world. I must warn that it contains gruesome and explicit material, which only goes to help picture an almost hopeless future. A breathtaking insight into basic human behaviour and a page turner."
4,coordination required,"This toy is a girl take on the bop-it that has been around a good 10 years. This is great for kids and tests their listening/coordination skills. It requires multiple levels of thought and basically asks your child to do three tasks and react quickly! It is better than sitting on the couch and starring at the tv. My 6 & 8 year old love it! And as with any of their toys - even blocks, you need to put them away and re-introduce them after some time."
2,I don't get it!,I bought this for my daughter who has just turned seven. She thought it was cool and has actually played with it twice in the three weeks that she's had it. I totally don't get it. She says she understands it and knows how to play it. I think it's silly and makes no sense at all. I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought it.
3,Not bad,It's an ok book for starters. Easy to follow and not really hard patterns. I would recommend it to beginners.
5,Muito Bom,"Estou aqui no Brasil , e comprei este livro atravas do amazon, e adoro o servio do Amazon e tbm o conteudo do livro é barbaro , para quem quer aprender , ou aperfeioar o que ja sabe sobre Patchwork , vale muito a pena!"
3,cute projects,"I checked this book out from the library enough times that I decided it would be best to own it! I love the cute animal quilt projects. I've just made the sheep quilt so far. All the pattern/quilt strip pieces didn't fit together as well as I would've liked, but if you're an experienced seamstress, you can still make it/them work for you. I think the author could've done a better job with making the original cutting measurements work together without having to stretch pieces to make them fit. As I said, you can still make it work for you. These projects are all sewn in large strips, sewn together, then cut down to smaller sizes; then sewn together. So, in the end, you haven't had to cut a bunch of tiny squares; its a time saving way to sew quilts. And, everyone likes to save time. The quilt designs are adorable and true to Debbie Mum's style. If you've ever seen her calendar's, you know what I mean."
2,Very basic book,Very very light in content. I found this book a total waste of money. You can find much more content relevant to anaesthetic physiology in books by Ganong and Stoelting.For example: the autonomic nervous system is covered in about one third of a page; there is minimal stuff on receptors and ion cahnnels and the material is so basic about action potentials you would want to weep.
1,2 words,"worth less............ok, i'll say a little more. every song is ruined by worthless commentary. don't waste your money."
1,Lenny Live - Dead in the Water,"I am a big fan of Lenny's studio output... I have all of his CDs. I am also a big fan of live performances, where the performer usually has the chance to stretch out and expand on the original songs.Unfortunately, Lenny doesn't stretch out live, he simply turns up the volume... on everything. The result is one massive wall of incoherent sound. Perhaps this is done to help mask Lenny's less than spectacular playing as he attempts to take over Craig Ross' studio role as main guitarist.Most of the songs are cut off in mid performance to show clips of Lenny being annoyed by interviewers' questions, Lenny being annoyed by fans on the street and Lenny just being annoyed with the world in general.The icing on the cake is the poor camera work and editing. I wish I had taken the time to read a review or see a preview of this one before buying it. This DVD is a definite dust collector."
4,Lenny Rocks,"Instead of treating this as the same old concert video, treat it as a rockumentary. This DVD starts out looking like a live concert but you quickly learn that it is a movie about Lenny and his music. I thought the concert footage was fantastic and the behind the scenes stuff was interesting. You definitely get an idea of the frustration Lenny has with the music industry. I was a big fan of the dreds which Lenny chopped off in favor of the braids. I like his onstage fro and Craig Ross's huge white man's fro, and when they start rockin with their two screamin guitars, you cant ask for better Lenny Kravitz. Pay special attention to the dude in the crowd rockin to Are You Gonna Go My Way.....hilarious."
2,"Lenny, this dvd - live is a BOMBER.","Interruptions!Interruptions! Who is that clown?This suppose to be a CONCERT! What gives?I agree that this dvd will be a dusty one. It is not a complete show as there are only ""2"" complete songs on it and is missing several key songs.[can't get you off of my mind/mama said/it ain't over til' its over].Totally annoying, interrupting songs with interviews in all the songs.That ""[JUNK]"" should have been put on a special segment of the dvd separate from the show.Do not expect the best from this one. Hopefully!!!>Lenny will get another DVD out there that is a complete show with the hits on it, all of them, UNINTERRUPTED!"
1,lousy interuptions in the songs...wait until the music stops,why would any filmaker ruin great music????? this is the worst case deal....great music and lousy editing putting in sound bites over the top of the live performance..........don't waste your time with this one or your money...lenny is great but the film maker [is bad]
5,"Wow, Harsh reviews!","But I can understand customers frustrations over feeling mislead. But if you realize this isn't a concert video, but more of a documentary movie, and are ready for that, you may actually enjoy it. I purchased this and a Mudvayne dvd from the Tower Records abandon ship sale, and as a big Kravitz fan, I enjoyed it. It was interesting to see Kravitz's charisma and on camera confidence and personality. I enjoyed learning more about the other band members, how Lenny interacts with fans and handles himself on an everyday basis, and how he deals with the stresses of the road. The documentary itself was very well done and professional (this becomes very obvious when watching it back to back with the train wreck Mudvayne dvd!)I also really enjoyed the ending with just Lenny and an acoustic guitar sitting on a stool singing a powerfully heartfelt ""Just can't get you off my mind""."
4,Works great!,Works great as a smooth girth cover. My only minor complaint is that the color does bleed on my horse's coat.
5,Lavender Oil,Pleasant lavender oil!!! Mainly used for minor aches and pains. Also wonderful added to your bath water. Good value for money.
2,smell too light,"I was told real lavender essential oil will smell very very strong. The bottom I received smell pretty weak, even if I sniff right at the bottle opening."
5,Lavender Bliss !!,I love Lavender and this product will not disappoint. Potent and delightful. Bring beauty and relaxation to your person and home. Add a few drops to Olive oil and enjoy!
4,lavender oil,"lavender smells good, strong fresh aroma I have had this brand before and have always been pleased with it thank you"
5,Such a SWEET voice!!!,"The only thing better than listening to Mark Bransfield's warm, sweet voice on this collection of old jazz standards is hearing him sing his own tunes. Definitely buy this album and pay close attention to tracks 4 and 11 (""Opposites Attract"" and ""Baby I Fly Alone"") , plus a beautiful tune on track 13 (""Moments""), written by brother Michael.Looking forward to hearing more from this new artist!"
2,"phrases are not helpful, didn't like at all compared to others","I learned to speak Italian in my car before my last trip and wanted to learn more, especially since I changed cars and needed CD's instead of tapes. These phrases were so silly and so useless that I quicly lost interest. ""I like your hat"" I didn't think that the CD's were helpful, I didn't like the way they taught you and for the price, I expected a whole lot more. I was really sorry that I bought these.My other tapes were cheap but excellent. I should have returned this item.Get something else......"
2,"If you love classical, this is for you","I have the 35 annivery tour, which I just love. However,this one will not grab the jazz purist, it is a fusion ofclassical and jazz. I found it boring. If you love who-ever with strings, you will like it, if you love theearthy, bluesy, rhythmic genera that is jazz, you will bedisappointed."
3,Good Book...for making your own Classes...,"Most of the stuff in ""Tome & Blood"" gives players templates for various Prestige Classes...which, by far, is mediocore at best.Candle Caster is a questionable one in my mind. By the time you actually get to light a Spell Candle, someone might've bull-rushed you in an attack (granted your fellow Adventurers ""protect"" you)...Blood Magus is a laugh...don't ask. So is Wayfarer Guide...he gets powers up to 4th level, then kaput, no more advances...how the hell is THAT a prestige class?Spellswords seem to be the better of all the rest...as is True Necromancer...thought abit tricky...Still, I like the idea that Tome & Blood doesn't force you to ""adopt"" their own ways...I mean, mix and match some spells and go to town!! Heck, make your own class while your at it!! And I can get that Shocker Lizard Familiar I wanted!!Helpful, but then again, WOTC could've done better...Of course, that's my opinion, I could be wrong..."
4,Tome and Blood,"Tome and Blood is a great book for anyone wanting to add more detail and life to their sorceror or wizard. It is a must have for DM that enjoy anding new spells and aspects to PCs and NPCs. The reason I do not give this book 5 stars is because it lacked any, new real powerful spells."
5,Best Class Book So Far...,"Tome & Blood is by far the best of the three class books that WotC has published. I believe that this book adds some excellent rules/depth to playing wizards or sorcerers in the 3e D&D world. There are 15 new prestige classes, and nearly all of them seem playable. Also, players of evil spellcasters will also actually have some prestige classes this time. The True Necromancer is a wicked class.In addition to the new classes, there are new feats, metamagic feats, expanded rules for item creation, new spells, descriptions of wizardly organizations (although brief in some cases), and a few new magic items.The most amazing new rule covers magic sneak attacks. Now a rogue/wizard can do sneak attack damage with ray spells. Ray of frost is amazing as a 1d3 +5d6 sneak. Wow!Excellent Sourcebook!"
2,Nothing in it for me,"I hated this book. There weren't a lot of interesting things in there for me to explore. I mean, sure, Dragon Disciple, Acolyte of the Skin, Arcane Trickster, Blade Singer, and Blood Magus (especially blood magus) are good prestige classes , the rest blow! I mean, a spellsword? Oh my, you can cast spells through your sword! Big deal! Or the candle caster? That's the queerest prestige class I've ever seen in my life. The feats suck. I've never been one for metamagic feats, and that is the majority of the feats in there. The new spells aren't that great, either. The biggest plus was the familiars. I would love to have a shocker lizard or pseudodragon.Other people praise this book like it is a godsend. I personally don't prefer magic users, though I was one for a while because my party didn't have one. But now my friend, a bard, can cast a lot of spells, so I'm ditching my wizard for a rogue. That is probably the reason why I don't like the book. I'm not big on magic."
5,Nothing to complain about.,"Before i had this book all of my freinds wanted to be Fghters or clerics simply because they thought that Wizards and sorcerers were too weak for use. Now all of my freinds see that after you gain enough levels the Spellcasting characters are more powerfull than a barbarian. Simply put, this book will show you the magical light."
2,The worst suppliment so far,"Useless metamagic feats or unimagitive ones (Greater Spell Focus, Cast without simple material components, etc)Prestige classes that focus on evil characters (becoming a demon, summoning undead) or require multiclassing in thief/mage, fighter/mage, or cleric/mage. A totally overpowered one that allows you to become a dragon (at the end +8 STR, +2 CON, +2 CHR, +2 INT, +4 Natural armor, Breath weapon, d10 Hit die, claws, wings, low-light vision, darkvision, and more!)Also contains a sample home for a wizard, some rules already in the Players Handbook, some description on familiars, and some really boring spells (damage, resist, damage, resist).I did like the art though!"
2,What a ripoff!,"This book is good only for explaining the metamagic feats more realistically.Beyond that, it's practically useless.I bought it because the books I bought for the druid and bard classes were so helpful, and I thought I'd get more help with my wizard/sorcerer characters.I should be so lucky.The book lacks many new spells that I think are particularly useful to lower-level players.The main reasons one would buy this book is for a more clear definition between a sorcerer and a wizard, and because it explains the metamagic feats in a more useful way than the players handbook does."
3,Like any other Dramm extension,"Not bad not great. I gave it 3 stars but for watering wands it as good as any, most are light weight. Dramm watering wands are not for heavy use but for general home use work just fine. Love the additional length, 18"", that's why I bought it and the lighter weight while not as sturdy does make it easy to handle. Just use some plumber tape on connections to help with leaks and don't be rough with it and should be good for years."
2,Blows,"I loved Grade 8's first album. When i heard a new one was coming out i was really happy and wanted to get it right away. But wait a minute, big mistake on my part! First off the intro is completely pointless. It doesn't even lead into Resurrection or have any significance whatsoever. When the Resurrection track came on, i thought that track was ok. From then on the album totally sucked. The only somewhat ok songs are Demons and I Don't Need. Buy Grade 8's first self-titled album and don't waste your hard earned money on this Grade A genuine piece o' crap!I still wonder, whatever happened to the AWESOME stuff on their first album. None of it showed through on this one."
5,My sons favorite band.......,my on loves the Smashing pumpkins and was Very happy to get this DVD....it's fairly hard to find and a good price as well...Very Happy I bought this!
3,"Interesting to read, deals mostly with modern 45/70","I got interested in the .45-70 caliber because many Buffalo hunters used to use it and thought I might learn something here.What you'll get for your money is sort of an autobiographical account of Mr. Matthews experiences with the caliber.There's a lot of stuff telling what it can do, including some stuff about loading/reloading (but not really for the total novice)but very little useful information about choosing a certain rifle if that's what you're after.I was disappointed to find myself reading mostly about modern model rifles and smokeless powders, all I really cared about was the old time weapons/ ammunition. Mr. Matthews does touch on that briefly, descibing his first reproduction from Navy Arms (it needed a lot of work done on it to shoot it's best)and a later rifle that he had custom built. The old stuff is what I wanted, I'd have given the book another star if there had been more there."
2,Too short.,"Not too bad of a book, but just a little short for the money. The letters and comments from Elmer Keith and other gun writers of the day were interesting. He seemed to do a lot of his reloading by guess and by golly -- but maybe there weren't many reference books at that time. He led a charmed life, though -- loading ammo and shooting guns that were judged excessive and dangerous by about everyone but Elmer Keith, with never a blow-up."
5,Perfect gift for parents.,"They loved it, they thought i made it myself and i said no, but i ordered it with love from amazon. lol"
5,Is it possible to rate this 6 out of 5?,"I bought this gift a week before Christmas and the shipping came just in time for Christmas Eve for me to wrap it and give to my parents. When it did come time to open presents,i let all the presents be opened for this best for last gift. I was very confident that my parents would like it so i recorded and made a video. They both thought that i was taking a picture of them but i came in and gave it to them. They were very shocked and when my parents opened and read it my dad's face turned red(held them tears)and my mom of course went down in tears. This was the first Christmas gift i gave to my parents that i paid out of my pocket. BEST MONEY EVER SPENT. I would HIGHLY suggest this amazing gift. Outstanding gift."
1,Fell Apart 3 Days After 30 Day Return Policy,Very comfortable chair that was helpful for my bad back until it fell apart tonight. 30 Day Warranty/Return policy ended 3 days ago. With a chair that puts you in a very vulnerable position it is no fun when the cords that hold the fabric in place suddenly break. When I first opened the chair I looked at this and thought it looked weak but the chair had such good ratings and I was purchasing a chair that said it held 300 pounds. I weigh in at 250 so thought I was safe. I am on a very low income and this chair was expensive for me. Now I have to pay the return and Amazon is only offering a partial refund. I am a long time Amazon customer and this is the first time I feel that I got a lousy product.
3,It's Heavy,"This chair is comfortable but is fairly heavy, not suitable for carrying any long distance.Also can be difficult to get up and out of. Overall I am pleased with this chair."
5,grandma in jenkintown,"This is a great chair,-supportive and comfortable.This is the second one ,that I have bought.This one, for an extended visit with my grandchilren in tx.I am obese and and have trouble with my knees and back and have trouble getting off a couch,but this xl is sturdy enough and high enough to use with ease.It is lightweight and folds easily,so that i can easily use it both in the livingroom and backyard.I bought the first one to keep my feet elevated after foot surgery,and the anti-gravity aspect of the chair was great for this, but it has also become favorite chair!"
3,not for everyone,"After receiving this chair, I was unable to make it recline, no matter how hard I pushed.My husband had no problem with it. I suspected it was because my legs were too short to reach the ground or footbar if I sat back in the chair. (I'm 5'5, but have short legs.) I took it to work and discovered that none of my co-workers with short legs could make the chair recline, but everyone with longer legs had no problem. It is very comfortable, well built, somewhat heavy to carry. I guess my husband has a new chair!"
3,"Nice Chair, But...","The chair is nice overall--but has one glaring weakness: the white cord used to tie the fabric onto the frame of the chair. After two weeks of ownership, the cord frayed and broke. The fabric and seams were fine. The metal frame of the chair was fine. I was able to make a DIY repair in about 20 minutes with old (but good) shoelaces, and they seem to be holding up fine.I think the bottom line is that the chair would probably work better for those weighing 260 or less. I weigh about 295."
1,Completely fell apart in six months,"Probably the worst product I have ever ever bought from Amazon, it faded within two months then literally fell apart after six, unusable. Stay away from this product. if I could give it no stars I would."
1,Very UNCOMFORTABLE.,"I am incredibly disappointed in these chairs. I sat in one last night for about 45 minutes and my back hurt so badly this morning, I could barely move. My husband, an easy going guy who seldom expresses negative vibes HATES the chairs. They are difficult to operate. I bought two chairs for the deck on our new house and now will be returning them for a charge of $44.20 in shipping costs because it was not Amazon's error. Big mistake and disappointment. I only wish I'd ordered from Overstock and I wouldn't have to pay shipping to return...lesson learned."
5,An Amazing Collection,"Alanis has been one of my favorite artists since Jagged Little Pill and I love her music even more today than I did then. This new collection of unreleased music is a superb addition to Under Rug Swept, which allowed us to see a whole new side of Alanis. The songs ""Sister Blister"" and ""Purgatorying"" are the biggest highlights, and give us that bit of rock that old-time Alanis fans have been missing. Also, the DVD concert footage is a real treat, because unfortunately, I was not able to attend the Under Rug Swept tour, yet through this, I was able to see just what I was missing. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone who has even a mild liking for the singer/songwriter."
2,Pretty Dissapointed...,"I love Alanis, but I'm amazed that she allowed this DVD to be produced. First of all, there is an *extreme* drop in sound quality during some songs, as if you were hearing it from a parking lot. And after fve frustrating minutes of wondering weather I had a short in my DVD player, BAM! It came back, and you have lost the momentum. It is also filled with backstage scenes, which are alright, but can become annoying on repeated viewings. If you enjoyed JLP and SFAJ for days on end, son't buy."
1,Bad Audio,"I am a big Alanis fan. I find it hard to believe that she would let this be produced. The audio portion of all her best (IMO) songs is totally destroyed by switching to other concert scenes at random times where the audio is absymal. Most of the DVD concert footage is a single concert where the audio is quite acceptable (given a live concert). However, if her song has been on the radio, the producers decided to really destroy the audio for it on this DVD. If you like her music, stay away from this one. If you like the personal side, then this is a great inside view."
3,A good addition if you are a big fan!!!,"If you are a big fan of Alanis you will definitely like this! There are some things that are new and interesting. I wished that there was more music on the CD though. I have not sat and fully watched the DVD, which is concert and backstage footage with a smattering of other stuff, but I am disappointed at the sound quality of the DVD, one of the cameras they used for filming has a bad microphone or something. If you can get a good price used it is worth adding to a collection, but don't pay a lot for this."
4,The Scraps are good!!,I'm going to keep this review short.I like the songs. I like the live material. I think her voice sounds amazing. I'm glad I purchased this item.
3,i wish this was on itunes,I'm a die-hard Alanis fan...which means I have all of her albums. There are 4 songs on this collection that I don't have. Some of them are are on 2 or 3 of her albums. I wanted to order the songs off itunes but the album isn't on there.I just wish it were on itunes...I don't want to pay 21$ for 4 songs.
4,Love having the option for free books.,"One of my favorite things about Amazon Kindle is that there are so many classics available for free. This was the case with this item. It is the first time I've read the second book about the land of Oz. Great book, new adventure."
4,This sequel outshines the original in every way.,"This book is the sequel to the much more famous 'The wonderful Wizard of Oz'. However, where the first book was slow and lagged at many points, this sequel was fast-paced, and added many great characters. Also, look out for the unexpected twist in the end. I reccomend this book to anyone who is never too old for a good story."
4,Addicting Nonsense,"I didn't enjoy the sequel nearly as much as The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but it held my interest quite well regardless.I found it to be lacking a likable character; the tin man has become quite self absorbed and the scarecrow has lost his backbone and therefore his thrown. The new characters are rather annoying, although I was quite taken with the Woggle-Bug despite his pompous nature. And I'm curious to know how the cowardly lion is, I wonder if he will show up in a future book?I do admire the book's humor; I'm a sucker for a cheesy pun. I am still anxious to read the rest of the series; Baum's nonsense is addicting."
2,Can't compete,Nothing else can compete with the Wizard of Oz. I was just not buying into the introduction of new characters.
4,A good second book in the series,"It is not quite as good as the first book in the series, but is still entertaining. It was a fun read."
1,STUNNED!!!,"I was stunned - absolutely STUNNED when I saw this book and had to read it - what a crock of garbage!! Edgar Cayce is a pure quack. back in the days of Webring he had 100's of ""Edgar Cayces cure for ""X"""" (fill in the name of every and any disease known to man!) webrings - a pure charlatan! So first he can cure any illness known to man and now he is a prophet!! STUNNING!!! Stay away from this man and the pure quackery he espouses! Next ... coming soon to a small village near you! Edgar Cayce will be selling bottles of strong smelling liquid from the back of a gypsy caravan!!!"
1,"terminally silly, unintentionally hilarious","Come on! This book can't be intended for anyone with an ounze of common sense. Totally incredible. Cayce at least had the excuse of an accidental nail in his head as a youth. Lost city of Atlantis, channeling, clairvoyance about stocks and horses, etc. Amazing."
5,Delighted To Discover This Book,"Over the past twenty-five years I have read a dozen or more books about Edgar Cayce, and thought that I knew just about everything there was to know. I was delighted to discover how wrong I was. Sidney Kirkpatrick's bio is full of new and interesting material and insights--so much that I read the book twice, and am now considering reading it yet again."
5,The burden of a gift,"This book demonstrates how Edgar Cayce's gift shaped his life and all the hardships he could have avoided had he not had ""vision"". Stanley Kirkpatrick is very thorough and we follow Edgar from his earliest days where he plays with ""fairies"" or tiny spirits to his untimely death as he was unable to follow his own advice for healthy living. It is fascinating life and a well written book."
5,Wow what a great book!,"I just got finished reading it and I just loved it. It's well written, in-depth and interesting. I especially like how the author isn't out to prove that Cayce was legitimate but to tell a story and give the facts. My favorite book of the year!"
5,A Heart-Warming Book,"This is a truly remarkable book in so many ways--the kind of biography that slowly pulls you in and doesn't let you get away. I was captivated by all the fascinating things that came out of this man while he was in trance, but what really made me like Cayce and love this book is the way that the author has captured the heart-warming story of Cayce's personal struggle to come to grips with his amazing talents. This book renews my faith in mankind!"
5,Totally Amazing!!,"This is a must read! It will change the way you look at life. If you ever wondered about the meaning of life & the big picture, this will answer it, and so much more than you could have imagined!! I'm buying copies for all my friends and family..... just read it!!!"
1,long and boring,"I didn't like it and my son, 24 months old, either.He was crying and asking me to change it. It's is boring and there is not story to follow, and rabbit is too mean. It's a waste of money!!"
5,Finally - a kids movie I will watch!,"My now-5 year old daughter has loved this movie for years, and I will always sit down and watch it with her. It's fun and funny, with great songs and a nice message. So many films for kids are cloying and lame, and this one really isn't. I really recommend it to anyone with a kiddo in their life that loves Tigger and Pooh."
2,Not the best,"First, I didn't realize this was a ""Disney Friends"" dvd, or at least what that meant. What it means is that it doesn't look like the cartoons, perhaps it's computer generated? Christopher Robin isn't in it, but instead there's some girl and her dog. The story isn't that great and there really isn't a lot of music, especially for a dvd that boasts ""Musical Too"" in it's title. My daughter has yet to sit all the way through it. I wish I hadn't purchased it."
4,Great for those little Pooh lovers out there!,"We have some little ones in our family who love anything Pooh and having watched all the old movies more times than we can count, it was great to have a new one on the shelf! Keep 'em coming!"
1,not worth it!!,"my 3 year old never finished watching it, it is SO boring, not entertaining. he loves whenever i bring a new movie home or take him to the movies. I wish I could get my money back. lucy"
3,Disappointed,Not what I had hoped for. Doesn't flow as good as some of the other My Friends DVDs. Lost my Childs interest within five minutes.
5,Tigger and Pooh and a Musical too,"I am a daycare provider, and the kids love this movie. They sing and dance along with it."
3,Strecthing,"Ok some like Erwin some do not. The things that I like about him, he seems to address my Inner soul in his writing. Things I am feeling but am to proud or arragant or something to actually talk about. This book so far has been great. He has talked a lot about being people of integrity, and passion. And not just to use that for our own benefit but to realize that it is to be used in-line with the will of God. I find myself stopping to ponder many of the thoughts that Erwin talks about in this book.A very enjoyable read."
5,It's a cable,This cable extended my keyboard to the exact distance promised. The signal from my keyboard went in one end and emerged from the other completely intact.
3,"Useful Information, but....","I found this software to provide much information about the vegetables one would grow in a garden, however, it doesn't seem practical. When you use the software to design your garden, It will put highest growing crops where they should be but doesn't seem to consider crops such as pumpkins and certain squashes that vine and stretch, into consideration. it would have you divide your crops in strange configurations and not take into consideration that the pumpkin (for instance), will grow into your other plants. Not exactly what I would call smart design. It has it's merits though, in it's information about plants. But when it comes down to laying out your garden, it needs a bit of help determining how plants grow outward, not just up ward!"
5,Wow!,"I wasn't as much a fan of John Tesh's as some of the other people on this CD (Yanni, Enya, Kitaro) but this record is something special. I have never felt so emotionally attached to a record. Having all of my favorite songs played by a wonderful orchestra on one record is something I have dreamed about and now here it is. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you John. You newest fan Barbara"
5,Pure Orchestra is Pure Enjoyment!,"I love this CD!Its all of the best of New Age Music, with songs by Yanni, Jim Brickman, Enya, and even two new tunes by John Tesh!! All richly done with a symphony orchestra!Tesh has done an outstanding job. This one is a ""Must-Have""!!>>Scott"
4,Like taking a scented bath in sheer symphonic sound...,"This album comes in handy when you want to take a break from all those Mancini, Bacharach, John williams etc. reissues. The program is drawn from compositions of top New Age artists all arranged for a sixty piece orchestra. The arrangements are quite weighty for the most part with a lot of bravado during the big moments. Strings breeze from speaker to speaker, with glissening brass and horns throughout. Yanni, Chip Davis, and Tesh himself have all used orchestras extensively. Keep in mindJohn Tesh does not perform on the album; he produces and had a hand in choosing the selections. One does not have to be a New Age fan to enjoy this disc; in fact I was not even familiar with most the compositions. When your in the mood for a semiclassical atmosphere this will fit the bill. Add a star if you think this album will inspire you to pursue more on the original artists."
3,Classical tradtion meets new age tradtion,If you love classical music then Tesh's reproduction of various new age artists will sooth your soul just as well. The only thing I wish Tesh should have included should have been a concert hall sound because it sounds a little stiff and choppy with some songs. Overall it is an enjoyable and relaxing CD.
4,Every Promise in the Bible from Genesis to Revelation,I beleive the way it is written gives you an understanding of the chapters within the Bible and give you the opportunity to personalise those promises made within to your own life
1,3 out of 16 failed within 200 miles,"Had these installed on my 1964 327 engine and so far 3 out of 16 failed have within 200 miles of driving. The pins holding the roller tip in are sliding out. Probably a bad batch, but this is not good. Now I have bits of metal floating around in my new engine :([...]"
1,NO RELIEF TO BE HAD!,"Ordered and tried three bottles of Joint MD, hoping the reviews were correct. Dissapointed that after taking this product for two month, my joint pain is still present..Tried contacting the manufacturer MDProducts 1-866-634-6530, they are unreachable, will not return any calls or e-mails. Found out through research that this product is sold as a health supplement at health clubs, and not guaranteed to work as stated on the bottle. Yes, there is no glucosamine, chondroitin or msm in this product. Pharmacy would not recommend this product for joint pain."
2,Read the Label,"I thought that I knew what I was taking. It didn't work and I finally broke down and went to a Dr. about my leg pain. I showed him all the things I was using, (Aleve, Joint MD, Icy Hot patches), and he pointed out something to me. He said glucosamine was good to take, but that Joint MD ""had lots of stuff in it, but nothing that was shown to work."" I doesn't have any glucosamine in it at all. I will stick to the liquied glucosamine suppliments."
2,Ingredients,"For those wanting to avoid the ubiquitous Splenda, you should be aware that Joint MD contains sucralose, which is what Splenda is. These pills taste very sweet so it seems like a totally unnecessary - and in the opinion of many - unhealthful - addition to the ingredients. Why not make this product without the addition of sucralose? What is the point of making a super-sweet tasing pill, for goodness sake?! It would be greatly improved if they removed this sweetener and I won't buy it again until they do. Other than that ingredient, it seems like a good product, now that the price has come down some."
1,parents beware,"My nephew who is a week old had a terrible time with the Nuk Orthodontic nipples in the stage 1 slow flow nipple. He latched onto the nipple just fine but after 5 to 15 mins of constant sucking, my nephew couldnt get any formula at all. We changed out the nipple on the bottle and he downed the formula immediately. Nana and I threw out these nipples, they didnt work at all for him! Maybe other parents or aunts will have better luck with this product than we did."
3,enough cliffs already,It gets boring watching guys do the same roll/flip off a cliff repeatedly for an hour. The first two Ski Movies offered much more variety and more adrenalized editing.
2,Not much to it...,"I purchased this for my 5 1/2 year old daughter. She is very interested in bones, muscles and their scientific names. This game is not as fun as many bingo games since you only get 3 in a row. Very limited in scope, I don't think we will be getting much use out of this one after she learns the arm and leg bones' names. Feet and hands don't name any bones at all."
1,Pompous posturing!,"lenny lectures about how he wants to be looked at as only a musician, but doesn't shut up once during even one song on this DVD, so you never get to hear a whole song complete. I would never watch this again since I found it very annoying."
1,Cut and paste,"The editing kills what could have been a great concert DVD. As previously stated in another review, Lenny talks about wanting to be regarded as a musician, yet the film de-emphasizes the music, pushing it into the background. Lenny has a great band and what is seen of the performances is excellent, which only makes it more frustrating when every song is cut off."
1,"No problem piling on, here","Like so many other reviewers, I am very frustrated by this kind of DVD. I returned this DVD to the store I bought it from and received in store credit. I then purchased a concert DVD, not a documentary film. I'd just as soon read a Wikipedia site to get the biography. Lenny is like most rockstars backstage. This didn't exactly break new ground."
2,Lenny live what???,"Well I must say I was quite disappointed by this dvd. I was looking forward to buy Lenny's first live concert on dvd ever since I have never had the chance to get to see him live. But I soon realized it was a bad copy of Madonna's ""Truth or Dare""... backstage footage and some ruined live track. When songs are almost complete they are spoken over. Lights and photography and sound and colors are all right that's why it deserves 2 stars out of five rather then 1 or even none. Looking forward to a real live concert or a single video collection at least!"
2,Lenny Kravitz - Live,"Looks and sounds great, but Lenny's ego gets in the way of what could have been a really good show."
1,Style over substance,"What Lenny is wearing or who he's dating is more important than his (lackluster) music. This is music for readers of People magazine a la Sheryl Crow. Very weak dvd of a media created 'artist'. Lenny, you are not Jimi Hendrix..."
1,Flowers too large,"I bought these for my 10-yr old daughter; my impression from the picture was that the flowers were small. They are not; fairly large, they were not appropriate for a young girl. When I took a moment to consider them for me, I also felt they were unattractive for their size. Finally the color was too brown."
4,Easy to use and exellent combination of ingredients,I spent years and a lot of money trying to figure out what was causing all my pain in my shoulder. I came across this product and started using it out of sheer desperation. Within two weeks I could detect a difference and within 6 weeks my pain was almost gone! I've been using it ever since and feel better now than I have in 20 years! Many people have told me glucosamine doesn't work for them and maybe it doesn't. But most of them have admitted they only tried it for a short time and not on a regular basis. I like how easy it is to use. I put it in a smoothie every morning and it actually tastes good!
4,Made a nice gift,I did not actually use this product I gave it as a gift. It looked really nice and the other people at the shower liked it. The colors are prettier in person.
2,Not very sensitive,This mic has problems picking up my voice. It's very quiet and I need to speak practically right into it.
3,it is ok,This microphone was ok i guess. i wouldnt recommend it for voice recogonition though. it just isnt good enough
2,Barely picks up voice,I just wanted a cheap functional microphone and was hoping this would do the trick. It does work it just barely picks up any sound even with microphone boosts on and yelling directly into it. I speak softly as it is so this is not even close to being useful for me. I may have just gotten a dysfunctional one but either way the microphone doesn't get the job done when I'm sure there are plenty of other clip on microphones in this price range that can.
3,Fits true to size,Nice but a little more light-weight than I had hoped. Still not a bad buy for the price and free shipping.
5,An excellent view of the west at the end of the 19th century,"""Life of Tom Horn"" has the ring of authenticity. Although a bit awkward at times due to the vernacular used, it is nonetheless a valuable and highly entertaining book for those interested in the ""real"" old west. Recommended."
4,A very good album by one of the greats.,"Air Supply is one of the best contemporary artists ever; and although their popularity died in the mid 80's, they never stopped making great music. This album pretty much proves that fact. The first half of the album is awesome, with ""Stronger Than The Night"" and ""Speaking of Love"" being the best. The second half, however, is not so good. Nevertheless, Russell Hitchcock's vocals are fantastic, and Graham Russell is also good. This album is definately worth a listen."
4,One of their best!!!,"I love this album! ""Stop the Tears"" always mends a broken heart.I really love ""Speaking of Love"" and ""Stronger than the Night"". I'm a Christian though, so I thought that ""Bread and Blood"" was rather offensive. Aside from that and ""Dame Amor"" it's a great album."
4,The Earth Is... a great CD!,"Though it isn't Air Supply's best, it's a pretty decent album! ""Stronger Than The Night"" really rocks, and I love it! ""Without You"" is better than Nilsson, and I still get chills. I liked 7 out of 10 songs... which becomes roughly 3 1/2 out of 5 stars, rounded to the nearest whole star... you get the picture. ""Dancing With The Mountain"" has got that rhythm! The title track is a little syrupy. But I'm one of those tree-hugger, environmentally conscious people, so I can appreciate it. (But not everyone can!) ""Love Conquers Time"" is a little weird, kinda boring. What I really love about this album is just how creative it is. Though sometimes they get a little too creative (""Dame Amor"" is probably the worst song they have ever done... what were they thinking?) with obscure lyrics, (""Don't confuse strength with pride and mud""? What?) I love them always."
1,Very Unhappy,"I bought a different,less expensive Revlon flat-iron about 6 months ago and loved it. I saw this new one and thought it would be so much better. To my surprise, it was not. I'm going back to my old one and returning the new one. This does not get as hot as advertised and does not straighten hair very well."
3,Non Steam Steam/Ion/Ceramic Straightener.,Well unless they kept sending me the wrong straightener then here is the problem. No place in the box or on the product does it say steam. I got two because I sent the first back thinking they sent me the wrong one... unfortunately they sent the same one again. I think it may have been a good straightener but it didn't do STEAM and that is maily why I was purchasing this item. Perhaps they did send me the wrong one twice... I will never know since I sent both back and never used either. I wanted Steam and that was something it doesn't do...
3,Not exactly for new comers,This is a good book. Explains a lot of .NET Winforms concepts really well. However if you are a relative newcomer in .NET then you might wanna skip this one.
3,"Good book, but I was expecting more...","A Very short (but objective) review:If you are totally new to Windows forms, this book is a great option.Otherwise, there are 3 chapters that wotrh while, speccialy the chapter about custom controls.To be honest, I was expecting a lot more from this book, but anyway, its still a good one."
5,Thank You Mr. Nova,"From the smoky `Henry's Off-Broadway' days in Seattle, to packed houses on his world tours, and here once again on The Shadow of Your Smile, Mr. Nova lays down a sound that comes straight from his heart . A CD that can be equally appreciated by jazz aficionados and any listener who simply loves great tunes from an artist who has truly mastered his craft - who continues to evolve over time like a very fine wine. Thank you, Mr. Nova!-J Scott, Palm Beach, FL"
4,Halloween Spooks........................and Not,"Some of the songs on this album like get the party started are not halloween songs:1. Get the party started:I like this song, but in halloween cd's it is just not fit2.I'm your boggie man:This song is really cool. It is great for dancing3.Ghostbusters: I've never seen the movie, but when you hear the song you kinda know what it is about:Capturing ghosts4.Addams Grovve:My Abseloute FAVORITE. this song is so good i have them in cds i make and it is not halloween songs5.Chicken Dance: This song is funny. It has no sining in it so I ussaly skip over it6.Monster Mash: This song is good too. It is funny7.Time Warp: I like this song. It's kinda annoying though8.Men in Black: This song does not have to do with halloween. It is in the men and black movie!9.Hand's Up(Give me your heart):This song is great. One of my favorites10. Munster's Theme: This song is short. A theme song on a tv show!"
4,Dust-up over a dustpan,"I love these broom/dustpan combos, but could no longer find them locally. I ordered 3 and they arrrived promptly, however, one dustpan was broken irreparably. I contacted ANT support by e-mail and was told that I had to return the broken item. I explained that it would cost more to ship it back than the item cost. I took a photo of the item, clearly showing the damage, and sent it in. I was told that I still had to send the item back. My response was that my only recourse was a negative review, and they refunded the cost of the damaged item. These folks will respond, but you have to work at getting their co-operation. By the way, did I mention that the long-handled broom and dustpan make clean-ups a breeze? They're really great!"
2,Not Long,"I would hate to see their shorter handles because this is NOT long. I am 5' 6 and I have to bend over to use it. This is very miss leading, the handle is short."
1,LONG? Think again,"This broom is most definitely NOT long, it's made for shorter people!!!False advertising to the max here!DO NOT buy this product if you're expecting a reasonable length broom, it's just not going to happen."
1,Do NOT order this from Ace Hardware,"This is a fine product---BUT---BUYER BEWARE!!!! If you think you are ordering ONE broom set from Ace Hardware, you will discover that you receive 4 and are charged accordingly---plus they will only allow you to keep ALL 4 or return ALL 4 AT YOUR COST. BAD business."
2,a little small and soft,"hard to find these dust-pan and brrom combos in the stores, so got this one.. only one thing:broom needs to be larger and stiffer, it's too soft, but works ok"
1,Not worth the time,This item proved to be a major disappointment. It worked neither in the sinks or bathtub as advertised. Not one to give up easily I have tried it on 5 more occasions and still nothing (my needle nose pliers got got more hair). I believe this produce is sadly misleading.
5,The right one for showers,"I've used a few variations of these things to clear hair clogs from my shower. I've found this design to be the best because it is skinny enough to fit through the drain hole cover and tough enough to lock onto the clog and pull it out. They can be cleaned and reused (easier if you let it dry out first) but cheap enough you can just throw it away rather than deal with the slimey hair balls. At this price, just order a few at a time and have one handy near the shower. No more standing ankle deep in slimey soapy water!! I've never had to spend more than 30 seconds unclogging the drain."
3,Worth a try,"This couldn't get to the clog in my drain. Still, it's cheap, and an ideal solution if it works. But if it doesn't, try Kleer Drain. It worked for me when nothing else (this, a plunger, Drano) did."
2,Kind of crappy,I guess it would be handy if you don't want to enter from under the sink & a plunger wasn't working...
5,best tool ever!,I've had a slow running bathroom sink for a long time and have contemplated so many complicated solutions to resolve it without using chemicals. But this little tool cleared 2 huge clumps of hair out of my drain in about 5 seconds and the drain is running at full speed now. Can't believe I didn't know about it before.
3,"PHENOMENAL, INDEED!","I really admire this song and its power to capture the whole world, after Mambo no.5. The latino beat what makes this song so great that you can't control your feet to dance on the floor. Asereje, though the meaning is not known to the public is adopted as part of the vocabulary of the people.When you go to offices, malls, restaurants, or riding a jeep/public transpo, Asereje is on the airvwave.People like the Latino beat, not the R & B and too Western songs.And there is a circulated news that Asereje means ""devil"" in Spanish. But to tell you, Asereje means ""have you seen"" in Brazilian. It is about Diego who wants to be the number one in the Friday night party. When those analysts claim the line of the song ""el himno de las 12 para Diego la cancion mas deseada"" is diabolic in meaning, well, it is natural for Diego to go home after 12."
2,Battery that doesnt do it.,"When I first placed the order , It said it was a Duracel battery, I trust Duracel. When I received it , it was some name I cant pronounce. I kept it because it was a Christmas gift for my mother. Well now I look worse, it doesnt hold a charge any better than the old oem battery."
2,satisfied customer,This came here in excellent condition and was here way sooner than i ever expected. Will definitaley order from this place again! This was just not pleasing to me cause they teach some innacurate facts in here as if they were facts. Not for things being taught to children that there is no real scientific proof of
4,Marijuana and You DVD,"Overall a good DVD. Still has some misconceptions of marijuana use however, finding one without trying to ""scare"" users from using is almost impossible to find. Good information with very little political slant."
2,extreme ignorance and scare mongering,This poorly researched propoganda campaign is laughable at most!The extremley illinformed commentary makes it all worthwhile.I recommend you light up a few spliffs before watching to enhance the comedic experience.
4,"K.T, Oslin",I bought this as a gift. The person I bought this for loved it. It had all of K.T.'s Great songs on it.
4,Beautiful cakes,"I love Wilton's books, i need more information on how to make tier cakes.There's isnt much info on this during the classes.I was hoping this book would help.Its pretty much for someone who has already had quite a bit of experience with these types of cakes.So in that way i was disappointed,however it does have some beautiful cake pictures in it.It does tell you all the tools that you will need for each cake.What tips to use for the designs & flowers.I rated this book 4 stars for this,so if you have had experience with making teirs cakes you shouldnt be disappointed."
4,"Not a perfect fit, but still looks cute","This cover can't be perfectly arranged on my car seat because mine has no seat crevice, but still looks pretty damn cute on my little yaris."
1,Horrible,"I received the shovel last week and it snowed 3 days later giving me a chance to use right away. I took the shovel out of my trunk, unscrewed the bolt, extended the handle and while tightening the bolt the plastic broke. Can't really give a full review of a snow shovel that breaks before it gets into the snow!"
1,Handle doesn't hold its length,"The ""turning lock"" on the handle doesn't hold. Regardless of how well you attempt to tighten it, the handle slides down to its shortest length when you start to shovel. If you want a super-short shovel it might be fine for you, but if you actually want one with a telescoping handle you should keep shopping!"
3,No Comment,"I put it over my head in the train on the way home, snoozed, almost missed my stop and ran, leaving the shovel behind. So I can't rate this item. Sorry."
2,"c'mon, steve, give us a break...","Nothing very, very good lasts very, very long - at least that's what I've been told. And so it went with Pavement, may it (they) rest in peace. My sadness was tempered, though - I was excited to hear what SM had up his sleeve. Unfortunately, not too much. I hope his forthcoming LP is more substantial than ""Discretion Grove"". This 3-song cd single is as lightweight as Fresca in a paper cup. It reminds me of how, once Big Star collapsed, Alex Chilton abdicated (to a substantial degree)his pop sensibilities. Malkmus has seemingly put little effort into this recording. I don't mean to come off as a ""playa hata"" because I'm a real fan of his. But this is weak, and anyone who says differently has a case of the indie emporer's new clothes."
2,Nothing special,"Very straight forward song, nothing too exciting about this one. The song almost reminds me of Texas Never Whispers without the guts. There is a humorous part to this song at the end that sounds like the Georgia Satelites or something."
5,The Art of Pepper,Something about this CD makes me want to play it over and over again. It is both soothing and uplifting. I've bought other Art Pepper CDs without having this effect. It is my favorite saxophone jazz record of all time. I originally read about it in an essay by Terry Castle which actually talked about Pepper's ongoing problems with heroin. He's been dead a long time but this a great legacy.
3,Not What I Expected,"The 1991 version was so wonderful that I wasn't even tempted out of curiosity to buy the SACD. I thought if the red book CD is this good I will spend my media budget on something else. Then I noticed it was remastered in 2010, this I could not resist for the price. I found the 1991 version is warmer and more natural sounding with great resolution. The horns sound brassy and full but not bright and it lays your ear right on the snare with the brushes. The 2010 remaster is so clean it boarders on sterile the bass isn't quite as pronounced. By the way, the content of this disc is exactly how Mr. Sedensky described it in his review.....awesome playing and cohesion!"
3,Not worth extra money!,"""Doesn't quite sound right,"" was my first impression of this disk, even though I had a great expectation when I bought the disk for extra money.If K-2 CD version sounded that good, I wonder what SACD would bring. So, I had to compare this SACD version versus JVC K-2 coded CD on my cheaper end of hi-end hi-fi system. To my ears, K-2 version sounded better. K-2 version offers higher and brighter tone than this SACD version, which offered much lower and subdued tone (one might say ""deeper"") of music. I must say the difference was rather large. The quietness (S/N ratio) of the background is the same on both disks. Overall, I could enjoy the music more with K-2 version, which is priced in the middle of conventional CD and SACD versions. This is mystery, because Bill Evans SACDs from the same label sound definitely better than K-2 CD version.For jazz classic like this, there is no need for hybrid, when everybody has CD version already."
4,Harry Bosch Music is Good,Harry Bosch Music is Good! M Connelly has not let me down on a music Rec yet. Buy it. :)
5,One of my best picks for 98.,"When I bought this CD, I thought I had enjoyed it thoroughly and was ready to move on to another favorite-CD-of-the-moment.But weeks later, when I saw them perform live at a small club in Chicago (Fall of '98), I realized just how good these guys are and gained a bigger appreciation for this group's music. And that's when this CD went through some serious heavy rotation in my stereo.Easily among my top 5 CD's of '98. If you haven't yet picked it up, make it your top 5 for '99!"
4,"Great, quirky pop oddity","I can't explain it, but this album is great. It's not the writing, it's not the musicianship... it's something else. Imagine if you crossed David Byrne with Abba, and stirred in a generous helping of the Cranberries. You'd get sort of an odd, latin-influenced, poppy-melodic, guitar-oriented confection. I'm really digging this CD. It has kind of a kitschy quality, so I don't know how it will hold up over time, but I've been listening to it non-stop for a week now."
4,"Please Sir, May I Have S'more?","This Komeda album is so great. In fact, I'm probably enjoying it RIGHT NOW!"
4,Euro revival,"In the 90s, a lot of bands rediscovered sixties French pop and soundtrack music that had long been forgotten. And why not?: the hip, jazzy, creamy, vibraphone driven swing of this music made it instantly attractive, and besides, most of its possibilities had never been intagrated into rock.Unlike Stereolab's winding experiments, Komeda do this in the form of pop songs. Each number on here has a funky bounce. The music is full of 70s style keyboards, popping beats, and molodic cadances. Yet, the band fully exploits the instantly recognizable stylings of the 60s Euro-pop mentioned above. Listen to the rising unison vocals of the first track, or the AM luciousness of ""Curious.""In the 60s or 70s, this band would have had singles on top 40 stations and albums all over FM radio. They may have come to late for their work to be on the airwaves, but so what? We can and should buy and enjoy this now."
5,I love Komeda!,"I wish more music like this was actually appreciated by the larger world. Oh well, I am glad that I have found it!"
5,A refresher,"This book is indispensable to any Texas Mason who needs to catch up or keep fresh. It is completely meaningless to anyone outside Masonry and thus is a true ""code book"". Few mistakes or ""typos"" and so it is consistent. But FOR HOME USE ONLY. Still I think it should be required for every Mason both new and old."
3,King Solomon and his Followers Lone star,Not the last revision. Several parts left out in all three sections. Parts that are left out were very easy to remember. They would like to know if you found any errors but there was no number to report them.
1,not thrilled at all,"This book purchase was a mistake. I guess I have too many good cookbooks to really enjoy or benefit from this one. The recipes are somehow ""trailer parky"" and almost watered down versions of better recipes that can easily be found elsewhere. There are no pictures. The high praise from some other reviewers convinced me, and I regret the purchase. There are so many better books on every kind of cuisine, that I can only recommend that you take a tour of the various cookbooks available before committing to this one."
4,Puerto Rican music,"This is not quite what I expected and appears to be a collection of new cuts of old music. It's OK, I guess."
5,SANGUINELLI BLOOD ORANGE TREE,"FAST DELIVERY, EXCELLENT CONDITION ( WELL PACKED, BEST PLANT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED ONLINE) VERY HEALTHY AND LUSH. HOPE IT BEARS FRUIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Smart Wool Socks are the greatest!,My wife loves them. Thanks...just wish they were a bit less expensive. The quality is there...just needs to be a bit less expensive.
5,LOVE All SmartWool Socks!,"I've worn little else as a sock since I first purchased a pair 4 or so years ago. I live in the north country and can't get over their amazing comfort level. They are expensive, but I get a couple years of wear out of them. I wear them in the early spring months and fall months, as well as winter. I wash these with my other clothes, but I hang them to dry rather than put them into a dryer. I prefer the X-large size to the large size. The colors and patterns are a bonus. Buy several pair as you may never want to wear another sock!"
2,Runs Small,"I have several SmartWool hiking socks that I love and recently bought different varieties of this lighter LifeStyle category. So far the other varieties are fine, but this style either runs small or the pair I got was mismarked. It is shorter than it appears in the picture and doesn't stay up. Plus there are bulges on the sides of the heels and the socks slip forward, which is another sign these are too small. It says mini in the title, but I thought that referred to the print, not the sizing. Finally, this is neither cushioned nor particularly warm. Definately not a winner for me."
5,A Fine Work Of Cyberpunk Fiction,"Once more John Shirley gives a fascinating, riveting tale about 21st Century Fascism attempting to take hold in the United States and Western Europe, in the waning phases of a conventional war between the United States and the Soviet Union. Dissent and treachery are rife in the leadership of the Christian Fascist Second Alliance (SA) and its primary opposition, the New Resistance (NR). The SA's grip on Western Europe grows tighter as it bids to win control of FirStep, the orbiting space colony. A splendid tale filled with mesmerizing characters that is among the finest works of cyberpunk fiction."
2,looks are decieving,"So I originally bought this item because it appeared when i typed in dark green ""joker"" vest. I showed it to my husband. We agreed that the picture was close, a dressy green vest. When it came in we were very very dissappointed. The vest is nothing more than a cashier's vest that you would see at your local walmart or home depot garden center. On top of that the stiching was extremely lousy and falling appart. We were very dissappointed in the quality and returned it."
2,Much like a clerk at a cash registers vest,Its very stiff.And not at all what I expected. Maybe I shouldn't have had such high expectations?Its very much like a cashier's vest.
2,Augusta Vest - Review,Product took longer than expected to arrive. Product material was not what I was expecting.
5,Excellent!,I just bought this book on a whim as it caught my attention. One look at the list of impressive chapter and subject material and I was hooked. I came home and shared my news with a friend! GET THIS BOOK. Its a keeper !
4,"Very different color than shown in the pictures, but still good.",I received mine today and eagerly ripped open the package to find the sarong I received (though definitely snake print) didn't really look like the pictures on this site. Mine was more of a sea green tone instead of this goldish/olive hue shown here. I'm still quite happy with it though. They sent a matching bead bracelet/anklet with it. That was nice.
1,Rubalcaba arrives in Miami,"This album lacks the expressive freedom we are accustomed to hear in Rubalcaba's interpretive style before he arrived in Miami. This album reflects what happens to Cuban musicians when they arrive in Miami and begin to play the ""entry tunes"" that will ensure them a market in the US. Is the same phenomenon seen in Paquito de Rivera and Arturo Sandoval, both now limited to playing elevator music and forgotten. It is sad to see that Rubalcaba fell into the same trap. Selling your soul is a must to survive in Miami. He is now destined to continue to play yet one more boring rendition of El Manicero (the peanut vendor) and essentially became one."
3,Light explosions,"More progressive arranging helps maintain interest but asides for a few distinct melodies, seems to be lacking a certain gel that could have made this latin jazz a truly memorable release."
1,Not my style,"Good thing I purchased the ""mini."" It's nice, and I know it's popular, but it's not my style. Too powdery. If you like Chanel No. 5, you might like Shalimar too."
5,You'll never grow tired of this CD!,"I first was introduced to this release in 1995. My sister and her husband had just married and whenever I spent the night I played this CD. More like fell asleep to it and listened to ""The Journey Begins"" all the time on repeat. I was always fascinated with the voices and the Native American undertones in the song. The Music is absolutely breathtaking. I still have the liner notes and everything. I just got this cd back a few years ago when my sister surprised me and ordered it off Ebay cause she know how much I adored hers. It was a free CD with the sign up for this credit card company, Prime Option? Don't remember her getting the card, but I'm glad this project came out of it!"
2,Look Elsewhere for an Intro,"This reprint article from Training and Development is not a primer on performance measurement. It's essentially five fluffy, rambling discussions of miscellaneous principles with emphasis on use in the training industry. For an actual introduction to PM, read Measuring Performance by Frost (ISBN: 0970247117) or The Basics of Performance Measurement by Harbour (ISBN: 0527763284)."
5,Extended Systems IRDA to USB adapter,"Absolutely fab! I was skeptical when I saw it and thought it would work with the new HP laptop that I just purchased that doesn't have a serial port. I needed to get my Palm info on it and have had problems with Palm Serial to USB device. This came, and installed easily even with Windows XP. I no sooner had it set up and set the Palm in front of it when they started talking to one another, I just clicked hotsync on the Palm and it was done as fast if not faster than through the serial port. Get one! You won't be sorry!"
2,Great Idea -- Lousy Execution,"Bought this disk because it was marketed as ""digital antidepressant"" and I thought it would make the long winters shorter.But the MUSIC on the soundtrack is so UN-listenable. Wretched. Like being stuck in a Chucky-Cheese. Horrible.And don't get me wrong: I LOVE AMBIENT VIDEO. I love ""video wallpaper"", and I've collected a fair amount of it. But this disk... The puppies aren't that interesting. The kittens aren't that interesting. The music is like having nails driven into your ears. The video set-up looks like a cheap attempt to make money. Purchase only with caution."
1,"More Garbage, Games Workshop Style!","The most overpriced tabletop game manufacturer is bleeding this licence to death, and this book filled with little paper hobbit dolls is the proof.This is nothing more that a glorified instruction book for the tabletop miniatures game of the same name, which is also another load of trash. Buy a copy of Chainmail on Amazon.com if you want to play a ""real"" tabletop miniatures game....and don't support the ""Greed Workshop""!!!"
5,That was really a good product,That was really a good product. It was written like new but actually it was new and I really enjoyed it. Thanks
2,I really wanted to like this coffeemaker,"I bought this because of its low price, simplicity, and--um--low price.My wife immediately disliked it because the filter area is hard to open, the pot is hard to pour without spilling, and the ten cup capacity seemed to be about half as much as the twelve cup coffeemaker it replaced.The good part is that it makes pretty good coffee, and keeps it hot without scorching it. The thing that is making me send it back after three weeks of use is that a part fell off. If it hadn't been for that, my plan was to purchase a different coffeemaker for everyday use and to keep this one as an emergency backup.Like I said, this is headed back from whence it came. Too bad."
1,Go to Walmart get same for less,"This coffee pot is like making instant coffee, it is junk. Doesn't keep coffee warm for long, is very light weight plastic piece of junk. I wouldn't pay 5 bucks for it, in fact I am reluctant to buy from Amazon.com again given this poor experience. I want to see what I am purchasing as in touching it and handling it. Will not buy anything again unless it is a copy of something I can first touch in person and then it better be significantly less otherwise why inconvenience myself and log in and wait?"
3,average,"it is not bad as a cheap item. But because the coffee that it prepares is not hot enough, because there is no automatic button and clock, i should have spent more money and got a better one."
1,I do not recommend this coffeemaker,"Maxi-Matic EHS - 2055 Elite Cuisine 10-Cup Coffeemaker (Made in China)Because of the low price this coffeemaker may be acceptable for people who do not drink coffee but want to have a coffeemaker handy for company. This entire unit is very light weight so I have to hold the base of the unit when removing and replacing the coffee pot otherwise I'd be chasing the coffee maker all over the counter. The coffee does not come out hot enough. It is one degree above luke warm so I have to microwave each cup. I make several pots of coffee per day I have found this coffeemaker very disappointing. I know in the very near future I will have to replace this coffeemaker. Therefore, serious coffee drinkers just skip even thinking about purchasing this product."
4,Great Bowl......,"I orderded a few of these although when I got them, they seem smaller that I had hoped."
4,A peek into present-day China,"I wouldn't be surprised if many people read a few pages of The Bridegroom and dismiss it out of hand, but I found this collection of short stories to be an enjoyable, thought-provoking read. The prose is terse and unornamented -- its simplicity has been compared to that of children's literature, and the stories do end rather abruptly -- but what I liked best was that Ha Jin showed so much about life in communist China without being pedantic. As another reviewer here commented, the utter lack of control that exists in China today is truly unnerving. Through all of his stories, however, Ha Jin never becomes a commentator or passes judgement; he simply tells it like it is, and lets the stories speak for themselves.My own personal favorite from The Bridegroom was ""A Bad Joke,"" but just about all of the stories present intriguing characters whose myriad personalities and situations will draw you in. 4.5 stars."
4,Great book of short stories-But leave you hungry for more.,"This is a great book of short stories. I mostly agree with the reviews posted here.I would like to add that this 'abrupt' style, as some have called it, it common in many modern chinese writers. I have many collections of contemporary mainland chinese short stories, and many (but not all) have this style. It takes some getting used to, but it's refreshing contrast to the more 'western' way of telling stories."
5,Ha Jin's stories are quite nearly perfect,"Ha Jin very effectively uses percise language (free from ornamentation yet perfectly descriptive) in these delighful & insightful stories of ordinary people (eg, factory clerks, teachers) living in modern China & forced to compromise/compensate for the conflicting demands of family and village, the state and party, and encroaching Western capitalism."
5,"Awesome, truly the best!","What's up y'all!! I'm a huge Britney fan, and i just got the Stronger: The Remixes CD today! It's the best! If you got the Oops!...I Did It Again Remixes (Import) and u were dissapointed, then don't hesitate to get this one b/c it's way better!! Plus it's only like $7 or something. The Best REMIX on the Cd is definitely #5, the Jack D. Elliot Remix. Here are the tracklistings to help ya out a bit.1) Album Version - you know this one 2) Mac Quayle Club Mix - LONG! (almost 8 minutes) Good though 3) Pablo La Rosa's Tranceformation - another long, yet good mix 4) Miguel 'Migs' Vocal Mix - slow and sultry, unique mix 5) Jack D. Elliot Club Mix - ONCE AGAIN, the Best! Gets ya dancin 6) Pimp Juice's ""ANSITVMG"" Mix - kind of hip-hop beat, yet dance and the 2nd best on the CD, behind the JD.E one!Well there ya go, I hope i've helped u and go out and get this b/c it's the best she's done!! She needs to have another number one single people! :) Have fun guys, and happy holidays! :)"
3,Tolerable,"Britney is the poster child for everything that's wrong with pop music today. If you must purchase something by her, or end up at a party where she is adored, request this song. Its one of the few that won't make you go deaf."
5,Nainme Spears,This is my fourth single on the kingdom hearts tour taken from the 2cond album: oops...I did it again.Its pop music but more louder and techno than my other songs on the tour.This was performed in Monstro the whale.
1,I hope I don't hear this again!,"Don't get me wrong, I used to think Brit was great when she first came out and yes, I did own both of her CD's and all..but this song..it gets really annoying really fast and her voice is whiny sounding and it drives me crazy.I don't know how anyone can stand listening to this or any of her other songs..as far as I'm concerned, her songs all sound the same. I would rather listen to some other female singers such as Janet, Willa Ford, and Celine Dion..at least they don't sound like whiny babies when they sing."
3,?,Good info for Gardner. Was looking for the idea on the front cover of the book to grow. Assume they are climbing strawberries.
5,baby loves this,I got this when I started babysitting my baby grand daughter. She is 5 months and enjoys the music at nap time. The songs are simple enought that as she gets older she will be able to learn the words easily to sing along. It is on my Kindle Fire and we can take it with us on our walks around the neighborhood.
2,School House Rock SAVE THE Earth,"I got this based on the wonderful School House Rock songs from my childhood and as my 2 year old is really into geography and the earth, I thought this would be wonderful for him (it is titled ""Earth"" after all). However it does not mention much about Earth but rather what humans are doing wrong and offers a few suggestions on how to help. As my family is already environmentally conscious, my son just had a look of ""what the...??"" on his face while watching this.Most of the songs are not very good or catchy and some are rather heavy handed.I will admit it is my fault for not looking into it more before getting it but just be aware these are lessons in saving the environment."
5,Schoolhouse rocks!!,I love their catchy tunes that help kids of any age pick up information easily. I recommend this for every school-aged kid.
2,Dreary,"I'm a big fan of the old series, and I revere the Earth, so you might think I'd love these videos. No. They encapsulate much that is wrong with the current green movement. (Don't get me wrong. I say this as a card-carrying member of the Green Party. I'm dyed in the wool Green, but we have to be able to criticize ourselves.) The idea of ""humans saving nature"" is way off base. Pure hubris. Granted, sympathy for cute animals is an easy sell for kids. Teaching respect for all living things is also good, but I'm not sure these videos do that. That would imply a far more spiritual approach. Most of these videos fall into a sort of dreary technocratic mode. In my opinion, the message should be one of survival and reverence: We have to change our way of living as a matter of survival, and we should live sustainably as a matter of respect for Mother Earth."
1,Co-Opted?,"School house rock used to be a useful tool to educate by virtue of actual facts and truthful information, now this earth video is pure Liberal propaganda as man made global warming is a Liberal fabricated hoax and our youngest minds are being indoctrinated with their ""opinion and ideology"" It's a shame that school house rock has been co-opted to feed little kids with false propaganda for the purposes of promoting an agenda."
1,"Complete propaganda, not to metion its based on non-science","No way my kids get to watch this. The labeling on the rear should be enough. This is an indoctrination video, not educational, I feel a little sick that this and other videos like it are out there. Don't insult your own intelligence. The original series is absolutely fantastic, to this day I remember every lesson. I hope that the same effect doesn't happen with the new video with modern video. The animation and 'lessons' are nowhere near as good, however, so I doubt it, not to mention the government school program teaches kids to have an ultra short-term memory anyway, hence most Columbia grad students can't tell you who the Speaker of the House is...."
5,terrific matte paper,"I don't know why- but I always have a hard time finding matte photo paper in local stores. I turned to Amazon, and they had some of the best quality matte photo paper that has some weight to it similar to cardstock. Galerie has been that I have even used thus far. It worked well with my Cannon printer. It also comes in a very nice sturdy box with a lid that comes off completely, not the usual flimsy boxes.I highly recommend this paper."
2,ok but not a good choice for portriat prints,This paper is kind of strange. I guess it would good if you wanted to do prints simliar to postcard feel.
4,Game,"Buy this game cause its ccccoooollll and you can be the separititst or the republic and you gotta take over the galaxy. Its lots easier be separatists because you can use order 66, which gives yiou like all the planeits. The board looks kinda weerd but its still lotsa fun."
5,its really good from what i researched but i have not purchased it!,its awsome also i want to make this a short review so it is good and just buy it!!!!!
2,Unbalenced!,"This game is very fun at first, but eventually, the Seperatists dominate everything, and they always win. This leads to huge arguments over who will be who. Overall, this game gets boring very fast."
4,Perfect gift to give with a fondue set,"We picked this book off of...... after receiving a very nice fondue set for Christmas. It reads very easily and is interesting for the avid chef as well as the casual cook. There are simple recipes and lots of history, and it can easily be skimmed in an hour or so. The author sticks close to the idea that fondue is about fun, not complexity. This is really all that is needed to get that new (or dusty old) pot and forks hot and ready to dine."
4,Great Fondue for Grownups!,"This book is chock full of excellent recipes that would be a hit with any grown-up dinner party. If you are going to have a get-together with friends and are looking for recipes that not only look and taste good but will also be impressive, this is the book for you. I really just wanted a fondue book with tried and true recipes that would appeal to my family. There are a few simple recipes in the book, but most of them have names like Italian Fontina and Porcini Fondue, Welsh Cheddar and Bacon Rabbit Fondue, Lobster Newburg Fondue, Smoked Salmon, Capers and Triple Creme Fondue, you see the trend. So if you are having an adult dinner party with friends and want to have something that sounds trendy or exotic, then this book is the one for you. If you want some simple family-type recipes, I would suggest looking for something different."
5,A cute little book,"I ordered this book as a Valentine's Day present for my boyfriend (I also bought a fondue set via Amazon). I read the other reviews, and I figured I might as well get it. Well, let me tell you! This is such a cute little book. I purchased the hardcover version of this book. It is a petite book, perfect size for keeping in a kitchen. I have a very small kitchen and it fits in perfectly. There are many recipes in this book, something for anyone in this book. I don't eat meat, and there are many recipes for myself. I highly recommend this book. The recipes come with suggestions of what foods you should dip into the fondues. There are also many alternatives to ingredients and ways to make the recipes healthy. Give it a shot!"
2,Not the best...,"Some of the recipes just don't seem too appetizing.......liked ""The 125 Best Fondue Recipes"" better!!!"
4,Very nice!,"This is real RnB entertainment, very nice! I like especially ""I wanna love you"" and ""don't walk away""."
3,OK CD,"Jade's album, Jade to the Max is ok. There are a few good songs on here and two that have been well played on the radio."
1,one good song&they looked good,Don't walk away was tight and they looked good.but overall the music was formula.nothing special at all.a dime a dozen.
5,Great Album,"When I saw that Amazon had Jade's debut album on CD, I had to buy it. I had it on cassette originally but no longer have any thing to play the cassette on. Anyway, Jade was one of my favorite groups during the 90's when girl groups like SWV, TLC, Xscape, Black Girl, Brownstone, and Zhane hit the charts. My favorites on the album are ""I Wanna Love You"" , ""Don't Walk Away"", and ""Looking for Mr. Do Right"". The singers have excellent harmony and can really sing! The songs are really catchy! I was sorry that they split up because I thought they were one of the better girl groups."
5,Simply a terrific album,"Propeller is the kind of record you'll pull out of your CD collection ten years from now and say, ""Yeah, this is a great disk. I still love it."" Great songs, hooks, lyrics, vocals etc. Just an all around enjoyable album in the singer songwriter vein."
4,YAAAY!,"OMG I MET this guy!! He was touring on a side stage at a Matchbox 20 concert, singing songs he wrote, and I swear he had a bigger crowd than Matchbox 20 did, lol. I remember thinking, ""I've gotta keep this guy in mind..."" and I looked him up about a year ago, and there wasn't anything on him, and then I found this, and saw the music video for With My Heart in My Hands, and it's the same guy!! (I even think he's wearing the same shirt... lol...)Original songs, nice smooth voice... overall good cd :)YAAAAY FOR PETER! Good for him."
5,great helmet,"I bought this as a replacement for the same model I've been using for about 2-1/2 years. It fits well, has plenty of ventilation, and is easy to adjust. I think the rear size adjustment is much easier to use than the Giro helmets, which is nice if you sometimes wear an earwarmer or skullcap underneath.My one compaint is the downside of having lots of ventilation holes - it makes the wind noise loud, sometimes making you think a car is approaching when it's not. Better safe than sorry, I guess."
1,Worst helmet ever!,There is no top of head padding in this helmet. Thought it was missing - but turns out that is how it was designed. HORRIBLE! Only padding is in front. These pads are so small there is velcro exposed - which left very nice scratches on my forehead when I tried it on. Don't waste your money on this one!!
5,Good,"Pros: Great VentilationVariable-thickness interchangeable paddingAdjustable fitNo bucket-head look, seems to look small on my head.Cons:Makes a wind-noise starting at around 18 mph. I stopped noticing it after a week.Straps not flat around ears. Again, used to it after a week.Overall: Outstanding helmet for the price."
5,I really like this watch,"The watch looks great and keeps accurate time. It is larger than many men's watches and is on the heavy side. These are plusses in my opinion, but these attributes might not be for everyone."
1,Poor Design,Have had multiple problems with the stem sliding out. When that happens the watch stops. It occurs when a cuff rubs against the watch. I sent it in to Seiko for repair once and it came back with the same problem. It is a poor substitute for my former Seiko that was about 30 years old. I wish I could get my money back.
2,Band doesn't hold up well,"First, let me say that I do like the watch face itself and viewing my wrist from above everything looks fantastic! BUT, flip over my wrist and the band and clasp are heavily scratched and the paint has worn off, and let me point out that I'm actually fairly careful not to rest my wrist on my laptop because I don't want to scratch the laptop.I could understand all this happening over the course of a year or two, but I've only been wearing the watch for about 2 weeks. So, I'll give the watch face a 5 out of 5 review, but the band a 1 out of 5."
5,Beautiful Watch,"My husband loves his new watch. For a Seiko, it was a good price. It looks very nice on his arm."
4,Very Satisfied,Hi amazon shoppers I wanted a watch for work that was elegant yet not extravagant and i got it in this Seiko. It is relatively thick but not heavy and Im glad I purchased it!!!!
1,Mike does not work well,It was doing well initially but after few days the mike did not function well. headphone is fine but voice disappears after some time.
1,Fair at best,"I have yet to figure out the microphone, but the headset seems to work. If the cords from the ear pieces to the control unit were longer, it would be more comfortable. Basicaly an over-priced unit.A better choice would of been to order the $5 USB sound card and then use a head set of your choice. That would accomplish the same thing and allow you to use regular head sets that are more comfortable."
4,Order from Chaos,"Establishing clarity in a brand portfolio for a large business can be a real challenge. The approach the Aaker uses, while it may be jargony, is excellent as a source to ensure that each brand sits at the appropriate place in the hierarchy and has a role that's clear.I keep on my desk as a constant reference. Yes, that's a little weird, but there you are."
1,"Rehashed, Recycled, Repurposed Content. Nothing New Here.","This book is more of the same rehashed, recycled, repurposed content from the authors. Much of this material is available in any basic marketing text. In fact, this book reads strikingly similar to just about any training manual on the basics of branding. If you've worked at any of the big agencies: McCann, JWT, Y&R;, you learn the contents of this book on your first day in about a hour. All the cases cited in this book are stale and extremely weak. The ""editorial reviews"" listed above are shill quotes from clients who are cited as ""cases"" in the book.Remember this before you buy: the author, and the firm for whom he works, use this book as nothing more than a lead-generation tool--it's called ""thought leadership"", a nebulous term used by company to propagate its own way of thinking. Save your money. Don't become a victim of Prophet's propoganda. Buy something with substance like Jean Noel Kapferer."
1,IF COLORADO IS YOUR HOME,"AND IF YOU ARE EXPECTING ""BIG THINGS"", YOU'LL BE DISAPPOINTED. THIS IS A VERY SMALL BOOK, AND IF YOU HAVE EVER STOOD ATOP A MOUNTAIN IN THE SAN JUANS YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. THE PICTURES ARE ""SMALL"". VERY SMALL!!THE POETRY IS FOR SOMEONE THAT APPRECIATES THE POETRY OF THE COFFEE HOUSES IN TELLURIDE, AND WHILE I AM SURE THERE IS A GREAT MANY PEOPLE THAT WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU ARE LONGING TO SEE SIGHTS OF THE MOUNTAINS OF COLORADO, AND WANTING A SENSE OF THE MOUNTAIN STREAM AS IT RIPPLES IT WAY TO THE VALLEY BELOW, OR TO BE REMINDED OF THE COOL MOUNTAIN BREEEZE AS IT CARESSES YOUR CHEEK THIS IS NOT GOING TO FILL THE BILL."
5,it's sidesplitting funny!!,I'm still young and everything about this Cd is hilarious and understandable for me at my age. Capital Steps makes all my favorite songs better and more comical.
5,Superb,"This album was released at the end of the 50's and blends a little of the new jazz from that era (bop), with a hint of big band sound (incorporates more than a half dozen musicians on some tracks), but mostly a lot of the traditional roots. Benny Carter is probably one of the most talented Jazz musicians of all time because he was highly capable in several areas: able to play a variety of instruments, and highly successful at promoting, managing, and composing. This album is just one notch in Benny's many contributions to Jazz music and a very noteworthy notch."
5,Nirvana,"I bought this because I like Benny Carter and I love the sound that Roy DuNann got at the Contemporary studios in LA. I had no idea that Ben Webster was on this session. I thought I had all the great Ben Webster, so this is a major find. In addition Jimmy Rowles, one of the great jazz piano guys of all time, Barney Kessel and Shelly Manne join Mr Carter. This is a must have for all 50s jazz fans. Simply an amazing CD."
1,Save your money,Totally useless. You can get all this info at CME's website(www.cme.com). Print it and read it at your local Starbucks. The $10 will be well spent. Deserves zero stars.
1,Avoid at all cost,"The packaging is allright. The rest, well a complete waste of time and money. The DVD has no structured story. The quality of the picture varies a lot. It gives no insight whatsoever. Please let somebody make a good docu with the consent of Olivia, Dani et.al."
3,Just for fans,"Just to be fair, this unofficial DVD has some interesting material. The interviiews to George Martin, Paul McCartney and Ravi Shankar are enough to buy it. However, the item ""Discography"" is totally uncomplete and hard to read on the tv screen.The package is really nice, but the audio CD is a mess.So, if you are not a fan, don't waste your money. But if you are, this DVD is the only acceptable thing about George you can get these days. I hope we get an official DVD soon (The 1991 Japan Tour DVD would be a blessing)."
1,An absolute disgrace,"You know you're in trouble when the back cover reads:""This is an unofficial programme which does not seek to represent the George Harrison Estate, Apple Inc. or any other official body associated with George Harrison. This programme does not contain the music or performances of The Beatles or George Harrison.""Add to that the false advertising:DVD Running Time approximately 75 minutes--> Try 57 minutes when the credits rollI'm taking my copy back to my store for a refund. It is certainly not worth the purchase price - I might buy it if it was $5."
1,Avoid this one,"Do not be fooled by this DVD's slick packaging as I was. This DVD is a truly awful mess, so much so that it cannot be called a documentary. It's just a disordered mish mash (there is no story line!) of some very, very poor, rambling interviews of people who clearly barely knew George and bizarrely whole clips from BBC and ITN news broadcasts about the knife attack on George and about George's death. The truly incredible thing about this package is that there is next to no music on the DVD. Come on. How can you make a so-called documentary about a great musician like George Harrison and not have any of his music on it? It looks like this thing was slapped together by a small group of amateurs who simply wanted to exploit George's death. Everyone involved in this project should be ashamed of themselves."

1,A Big Disappointment,"What were they thinking over at Centaur records?? Where are the classics as the title suggests.??? This CD contains music from when it was produced. Obviously sales were down on this CD as DJ Michael Fierman did not produce Vol. 4, a shame since he did such a great job on the original and Vol. 2. I remember Michael from the Pavillion and this CD does not represent how I remember Michael or the classics he always played. A waste of money."

5,Our favorite book!,"As soon as I read/sang this book to my children, it became our new favorite book! It is such a fun book, and the pictures are adorable. This illustrator is one of my favorites. We own several children's books he has illustrated, and we love 'em all."
5,A favorite at our house!,I am a teacher and bought this for my classroom. As I was reading it to my class I knew that my own children would love this book. I purchased another one for my children and they love it. We kind of sing it while we read it...super fun!
5,Very Entertaining!,"My daughter loves this book. She walks around singing ""ain't gonna paint no more."" She spends a lot of time looking at the pictures in this book, more so than with other books we read. It is a book that is entertaining for both of us. Great pictures, cute story, not too long and not too short."
5,Got to have it!!,One of the best books i have bought for my P-K class. Reading it and then following up with a painting activity is great to see the kids express them selfs and how they interpreted the book. They even painted themselves just like in the book. Great and fun book to add to your curriculum.
5,Love that dog!,"With this title a reader might think that very little painting will occur in this picture book; on the contrary, AIN'T GONNA PAINT is a riot of color, mostly all over the body of our unnamed protagonist. A wonderful rhyming read-aloud (or sing-aloud to the tune of ""Ain't Gonna Rain No More""), the real treasure here is David Catrow's wonderful illustrations. The scrunchy-faced little boy runs the gamut of emotions from bath-time disgust to paint-time glee. And the dog is the most expressive companion since Max in ""The Grinch Who Stole Christmas."" This is a terrific read-aloud that kids in grades K-2 will love (especially the veiled reference to painting your...well, it rhymes with nut). 2006 ALA Notable Children's Book"
1,Dumbing Down of the Education System,"The improper english and illustrations in the book depicts a child that is unruley and raised in a household of uneducated parents. I had to explain to my kindergartener that this child in the book is bad and that people who talk in this manner are lazy and uneducated. She did learn two things from the book, the importance of having a good education and caring parents that discipline and teach their kids proper english. Will the author next book be titled ""Axe Mees First Cause It Be Mines""."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"Leave it to Amazon to provide inadequate product information. This ""Book"" is simply an article from Training & Development Magazine, September 1998. I already had this magazine and I'm sure your library does as well. Also, only half of the article is actually by Linda Richardson."
2,Need More Rock Music,"Of course, the guy did movie soundtracks so I shouldn't complain. I guess I expected more along the line of The Carrie Nations from ""Beyond the Valley of The Dolls"" which was probably Stu's crowning acheivement. Never-the-less, there are some good tracks mid-way and threw the end of this CD that have a little more of the hippy rock music I was hoping for."
4,Convenience in a Capsule,This product was recommended to me specifically by my orthopedist following injections for my arthritic knees. I find it works better than the different brands of glucosamine/chondroitin I'd been taking for about a year on advice of my regular doctor. Taking two capsules a day after a few months (rather than three)is a true convenience and easier to remember in my schedule. The capsules are very easy to swallow.
3,Not double strength,"I like Cosamin DS, they work better than other similar products I have tried but these are NOT double strength. The pills are the same size and contain exactly the same amounts of the same ingredients as stated on the label. The price was the same as the single strength so no loss but no gain either."
2,"Works, but bad side effects","Since begining CosaminDS I've had increased tiredness, dizzyness and dull pressure in my right earI've been using ""Joint Juice"" drink for the last 5 years to very good effect, but I wanted something more portable for when I travel out of the country and am gone for more than a week as I will again have sharp back pain and disabling knee pain."
1,very boring,"sorry to say that, but this is a relatively boring book, not as excited as it topic implies."
3,Good data - poor quality - overpriced,"I was both happy and disappointed. On a positive note, it lists plenty of sources for everything from common to esoteric tackle. You definately get an A+ for tracking-down sources. Unfortunately: (a)it was printed on super thin, cheap paper which will tear easily after repeated use or when touched with damp fingers. For $25 you could have used 20lb bond! (b)it's printed 2 columns per page - very hard to read! (c)there's more data in the index than in individual company listings. For example, ""rod building"" references several companies whose description doesn't even mention rod building supplies. (d)last, but not least, it's overpriced at $25. Unless you're going to order hundreds of catalogs, save your money and spend a couple of evenings with Yahoo, looking for tackle stores."
3,LionelTrain,Not what I was expecting. A battery run train was not what I thought I was getting. It is not the trin set from my past that had a metal track and a transformer with adial. But it does go around on the track. My grandchildren love it they are only4 years old and 18 months.
4,Great Train for the price,If you are looking for an old fashioned Lionel train this is not for you. If you are looking for a reasonably priced train to put around your Christmas tree that is large enough for the kids to operate and get on the track this is for you. My 4 year old loves it and so do my pre-teen girls. Battery life is good and the sounds are great. I mounted the track to a wooden circle I made out of plywood to help keep the track together (train track is in a carpeted room) because the track would separate easily. My only real complaint is the coal car like to disconnect from the engine occasionally as the heights of the couplers seems a bit off. No big deal though. I could not afford the $250 version of this Lionel set so this has worked out well. Don't expect original Lionel quality but it is still fun.
3,OK,Overall good purchase for the holidays. I am a little bit dissapointed though. This train is made completely of plastic. I do like the wireless controller and the ability to use the whistle and bell. The train itself though looks and feels cheap. The sound effects are poor to say the least especially the idle sounds as it plays a 4 second sound clip with a blank spot in the loop. I am overall pleased to have a train around my tree this year however next year I'll spend more money for a higher quality and smaller train set.
4,Great Christmas toy for all ages,Like some of the others I was a little worried about how well the product would be made based on some of the other reviews but I have to say I was very happy with it. It comes very well boxed and it was very straight forward to fix together. The remote is very easy to use and my 5 year old and 3 year old were soon able to play by themselves. If the train comes off the tracks it does need an older child or adult to pop it back on but otherwise it provided hours of fun for our kids over Christmas. The Christmas bell which comes with it (from the film) was a nice little addition and is already established as a very special family decoration. It was also enjoyed by out 3 moonth old on her play gym.! The sounds are very clear and the speed up and slow down effects are great. If it had steam it would be perfect but all in all a great product which becasue of the box I think will be protected and a joy each Christmas for years to come
4,Good train,This is a great starter train especially if the kids have seen the movie Polar Express. I would recommend getting the 9.6v rechargeable battery with charger; I spent $28 for both incl. shipping.It's supposed to be a Christmas train (brought out with the tree/put away with the tree); we'll see what the reaction is when it gets put away.
2,Pay the extra $ & get a better train,I should have listened to the bad reveiws. Ended up sending back the polar express and paying a little more for the lionel pennsylvaina flyer train set 0-8-0 ($148 + shipping). The diecast is much more durrable and comes with transformer so no batteries are needed unlike this one. I'm so glad for amazon's great return policies!
5,I don't know where the bad reviews are coming from?,"We purchased this train as a Christmas gift for our 2 and 4 year old boys. They love it! The day after Christmas, we took it to the local Botanical Gardens where a train club has a historic G-scale track set up, and they were delighted to let us run our train on their track.We have not yet had to replace any batteries, but will probably go with the rechargeable 9-V option, since we try to use rechargeable batteries whenever we can.The tracks stay put together, although it takes one of us adults to put it together. The cars seem very durable so far."
4,Won't run,"Santa got this for my boys for Christmas (ages 5 & 7). Packaged well, durable. The track goes together easy and is sturdy. Comes with batteries which is a big plus; however, after getting everything together and pushing the button, it will only move a couple inches and then stops. How disappointing is that to two little boys who want to play with it on Christmas. So now I have to get 6 more C batteries and hope that that will fix it."
1,Not Sure of Amazon Price,"Look around before you buy! As Amazon keeps changing the price on this train, it was not till I found the same train at half of Amazon's price, that I returned it for a refund. They play the same game the Airlines play, only backwards, buy early will not work on Amazon."
2,Train stops and comes apart,We purchased this train to go around our Christmas tree. We have a 5 year old 2 year old that love trains and the Poar Express movie. The thing is junk. It rarely makes it around the track and now will not go at all. The train derails easily and cars come apart as well. the sound effects are cute but that is about it. I would not recommend this train to anyone looking for a good train for the holidays.
1,Remote Control is not functioning as a remote,"My father bought this for my 3 year old son and we are all wondering how come the train has some sounds when turned on but it doesn't move. We replaced the batteries that come with it with new ones and same result. After few minutes of trial and also reading the entire manual, the train moves when the remote control is touching the train. If it leaves more than a few inches from the train, it stops. My son who likes trains lost interest that he cannot control the train since we attached the remote on top of the train to keep it moving. I checked the manual that the remote should work within 10 feet from the train. Apparently, this is a defective unit. I already initiated the return process from Amazon, but I'm not thinking of getting the same model. It's difficult to put the train on the tracks."
5,Great train for the price,"I too was reluctant to buy this based on reviews, but didn't want to spend alot on the other O-gauge train set. I have never had a problem returning things to Amazon so I thought I'd give it a shot. My three year old and 9 year old are LOVING this set. As a matter of fact, they are fighting over who will control the train as I type. It's bigger than I thought and a little more sturdy than the ""plastic"" I was expecting. I am having a problem with the coupler staying attached between the engine and coal car, but if you thread the power wire through the coupler, it stays attached. This set is battery powered, so you don't need to find a way to run a power cord if you are wanting to put this under your tree, which was my goal. I am going to buy some accessories for this set because my kids are loving this so much."
3,"not what was advertised, but O.K. anyway","This train is a nice train for the tree, but it is big. The train that we ordered was advertised as O gauge, and the one we got was G gauge. We thought we were getting a great deal on a O gauge train, and with the price paid we got a G gauge train at regular price."
2,Wire connection is very frustating........waste of money,We are really frustrated with its wire connection. As batteries are in coal car & we have to connect it with wire to engine. We have to spend at least half an hour to get it started......really frustating.......do not bye it......waste of money....Lionel Polar Express Train Set - G-Gauge
3,"Nice set, but all plastic. Great to play with after reading the Polar Express story!","Nice set, but all plastic. The tracks are initially difficult to snap together. I imagine, as one does it multiple times, the plastic will give more easily. It does do all the functions stated, which is nice. After separately purchasing a rechargeable battery from Radio Shack, it took quite a bit of effort to place that battery in correctly, necessitating the use of a sharp instrument to help move some of the metalic connection so the battery would fit AND work. All in all it's a nice set, but does not compare to the LGB trains of the same size."
1,BROKEN OUT OF BOX,"Bought this train July1, for Christmas morning. Kept the train in the shipping box until Christmas Eve, when I took it out to wrap it.Opened Christmas morning for a very excited Autistic child who LOVES the Polar Express only to hear the motor whirr but the engine wheels would not turn. Had to wait til the local model railroad shop opened after the holidays to drop it off. Just found out that the gears in this BRAND NEW JUST OPENED TRAIN are not available, so this new train cannot be repaired. As a single mom on a budget, with a child whose obsession is Lionel trains, and especially the Polar Express train/movie/books.... I AM SO DISAPPOINTED! I may cease ordering from Amazon entirely because this now makes twice that I have ordered items tht are btoken out of the box or filthy out of the bag."
4,Great train for under the Christmas tree!,"I was pleasently surprised when in received the train. When I ordered it I was concerned about the size but it is perfect! The detail on the train is beautiful, it is quiet and runs great. Best Christmas present of 2012!"
2,Worked great for 3 days,"Worked great for 3 days and then one day it just stopped working - no lights, no movement, nothing. Switching between two new 9.6v batteries didn't make a difference.The engine (when it works) is fast and reasonably well put together. Clearly a kid's toy, not a model train in the usual sense. The track is cheap plastic that doesn't really fit together very well - putting together one curve joint will often partially separate another. The human figures mount on pegs that are easy to break off.Disappointing really... My son really loved it, but I think a return is in order."
2,The train hooks are cheap,I paid too much for a train. The hooks that holds the train together is not good. The train should be 30$ not 100$. My son still likes it. But get upset when the train comes alose.
1,Horrible. Badly designed lasted one hour. Do Not Buy!!,"Man, everything is wrong with this train. We got one for our four-year old and it lasted an hour with my supervision. The track is really badly designed and hard on your hands when you try to put it together. The 4 (or 6?)C batteries are in the coal car, and the wire connector dealie to the engine was the wrong size and slipped out all the time. Get an O-gauge. Lionel should be ashamed of this product. We went out the next day and bought one of the O gauge stes, which is really good, Winnie loves it."
3,"Looks good, hard to keep going","Train looks goods, and seems made well structurally. BUT, it is a bit difficult to get going and keep going. Tracks are very tempermental to put together (and keep together). The train is very prone to going off track. We purchased (as many will) for under tree train for kids, but noone can really enjoy/touch it for fear that tracks will pop apart or train derails. Would work best in scenario where train will be off limits from humans and normal homelife (i.e., not under a tree at Christmas)."
2,A Real Pain,"I bought this item because I thought it would be a great ""Under the Tree"" decoration and toy for the grandkids. It would probably work well as a decoration if you never turned it on. It comes off the track too easily. Difficult to get back on track. Practically have to ""hug the floor"" to get low enough to see the wheels and where to place them. Impossible for kids to do. Difficult for grandpa."
4,Great for the price paid,"We've been talking about getting a train for under the tree for years now and decided it was time to find one. Saw this at Amazon.com and it was an amazing price. We didn't really expect much, but we were very thrilled with it after setting it up. The battery life was short lived and it appears finding a compatible rechargeable battery is not as easy as it is made out to be, but I'm sure we'll find one with a bit more research. It really is a great first train set, all in all."
5,Nice train,After reading the reviews I was hesitate in purchasing this train for under our Christmas tree. Am glad I did not listen to them. This is nice train. If you don't race around the track the train stays on the rails and rails stay together. I like the options of changing the track configuration to meet the needs of different sized trees. We will enjoy it this year and for years to come. Did I mention that the price was good also?
4,Great christmas train for grandson,"The train is great for small children it has a bell, whistle and an announcement all aboard for the Polar Express. It has forward and reverse and also has steam sounds. I had to lube some parts to make it run better but it does do well. It does require suppervision for small children but the remote controll is very easy to operate."
2,Negative reviews said it out loud,"Unfortunately I had read the reviews after ordering .and I was able to relate to all the negative reviews.I was trying to believe that at this cost it just can't be true,but1. It is really difficult to place train on track and connect cars while keeping all on the track.2. Uses up loads of batteries.3.poor quality.My almost 5 year old boy is crazy about trains,he was waiting to get polar express anxiously for two months.once he got it and we set it up,he played with it two times and placed it back in the box. Asked me to send it back to Lionel and to tell them about all its problems,but I live in jordan and had ordered it on the Internet and paid shipping and customs and the box is big so it would cost me too much to return. But we were all so very disappointed."
2,not a good train for impatient children,"I spent the whole day Christmas trying to figure out how to get the train and train tracks to stay connected. The whole day my son came to me crying at least 20 times asking me to fix it. I tried rubber bands, string, tape, pliers and it a few were successful however it doesn't look all that good and my son did not want the main battery powered trains connected to the caboose ones. He wanted to be able to unplug it and move the conductor around. So I can say that this train was the biggest pain of my life. I do not know who designed it but to make a train that can't attach to the other pieces was pointless. It is not that hard to make a latch that attaches and detaches."
2,Disappointed,"Purchased this for our son to put around Christmas tree. The train is really cute, but we can't get it to stay on the tracks. We are sending it back for a refund and will look for a better quality train."
4,Nice for under the tree.,This was a gift and the kids really like it. One thing about it is that there is a lot of play between the gauge of the track and the wheels on the car. You have to really be conscious of making sure each wheel truck is actually on the track or it derails.
1,"Sorely disappointed, cheap product, don't buy it!","Bought it in July right after my son saw the movie. He played with it for a few days and then we packed it up to bring it out at Christmas so he'd enjoy it under the tree and for his birthday. Darn thing wouldn't work at all. It'd been stored carefully in original packaging, with the batteries removed. Hooked it up Christmas Day and...nothing. Got new batteries all around. Still nothing. My son begs me to fix it every time he sees the tree. What an awful experience! No idea what to do now -- return or double down from a retail store vs Amazon since it'll cost me a bunch to return for a partial refund. Oh, and I agree with all the comments about poor workmanship. It isnt the Lionel of old. More money for Brio trains. Don't play the odds, don't buy this product, or at least not on Amazon."
4,Great G-Gauge Battery Operated Train,"My son, a toddler, loved watching the previous EZ Track Christmas train run around the base of our Christmas Tree. However, the noise from the EZ Track train became unbearable with the constant use. We landed on the Polar Express Lionel G-Gauge as a replacement. He loves watching it just the same, and it runs so much quieter. Highly recommend ordering the 9V rechargeable batteries, as it tends to run through the C batteries very quickly. It also, runs a lot faster on the 9V."
2,Surprised and disappointed,"I found this toy in the end to be very expensive to operate. My son is younger and wanted it running for a couple of hours on Christmas morning and during that time the toy consumed 6 ""C"" cell batteries. The Amazon site does not tell you about the ""C"" cell batteries only the ""AA"" batteries, that is a big slip up. Since Christmas this is about 6 batteries per day! At BJ's those same batteries are about 14.00 per dozen. The locomotive is very detailed and made of plastic, what happens is a young one likes to carry his locomotive around and the plastic bends. I have a choice to make, spend 100.00 on quality rechargable batteries or send this back and buy the 260.00 Polar express ""O"" guage set which is very high quality and metal. In the end I'm disappointed in Amazon for not mentioning the ""C"" batteries and Lionel for not putting a permanent power source on board. I would tell a friend to save their money and buy the ""O"" gauge set over this one."
4,My son's magic train,"My three year old son asked Santa for a ""magic train"" for Christmas. Upon further investigating, I realized he was talking about the Polar Express train. Went to local stores trying to find it two weeks before the big day with no luck. I googled it and this amazon listing came up. I immediately ordered it! My son is a true train lover and this train is no different. He was so excited to see it under the tree from Santa. The train itself is perfect size for a little one. The remote is simple enough for him to use. When he presses the button it says ""All aboard, this is the polar express."" All in all I am pretty happy with my purchase and so is he!"
2,Dissapointed,"My son was very excited to get this train. It is wonderful looking but the hooks that are supposed to hold the trains together, do not stay together. It was very frustrating trying to keep the cars hooked up and also trying to keep them on the tracks. I finally ended up taping the train car hooks together!! My son lost interest and went on to play with something else. =("
3,okay train for the tree,plastic parts especially the track don't appear to be solid - I wouldn't expect this train set to last more than a couple of seasons. snapping the track together was easy and the train stayed on the track - the $100 price is a little too much for the quality of the product. the train does not have a shut off you have to wait 10 mins for it to time out and the sound is constant throughout the entire time it runs it would be nice to have the option of turning it off as it can be a little annoying
5,Great Train!,Our boys (2&5) were so excited when we got this train. The remote is easy enough for them both to run by themselves. The track is pretty large and fits around the outside of our tree skirt. It also came with a large silver bell as well as tiny figures of the conductor and the little boy from the movie.It was very easy to set up and is nice that it came with batteries.
4,Cute Durable Train,"My son received this for Christmas. It is really cute, and runs really well. He was also given two rechargeable battery packs for it (which I highly recommend), and it really steams much faster with those. He loves it. Unfortunately, I have to knock it down one star, because there is only enough track for a tree loop. I contacted Lionel to find out how to get extra tracks for it, but they only make replacement parts, not extension packs. It does fit other g gauge tracks just fine, but you just can't combine the tracks with the original set. So, you either use it with the small loop of track that came with it, or you have to buy all new track to be able to make larger runs."
1,Waste of money.,This seemed like a good product at first but didn't last long. Very cheap plastic and track parts do not link together very well after a few uses. I would not spend money on this again. My son played with it for several times and then the track was hard to put together.
4,After a Year It's still a Favorite!,"Last Christmas This set was all my son wanted (he was 6yrs old). He was very excited to receive it and a year later it is still in use and still gets his undivided attention. This year all he wants is more track for a longer train ride! At 6-7 yrs he is able to connect the trains when they come apart and he doesn't seem to mind (even real trains need some maintenance). If the track is on cushy carpet it will have a hard time staying up, because it is a good solid plastic train it is a bit top heavy. I wouldn't recommend it for kids under 5, I don't think they would have the patients for this level of train. I believe Lionel makes another simpler PE train for youner kids. But for the $$ this G guage is a great alternative to the O guage train!"
5,Huge hit in our house,This train exceeded our expectations. We got this Christmas of 2010 for my then 3 year old and he loves this train. It stayed out for a couple months after Christmas and than put it away. It came out throughout the year and will soon be under the tree again this Christmas. This train works wonderfully and we do go through a lot of batteries but it is because it will go for hours without shutting off! If you have a kids that love trains and/or the Polar Express this is must have!
3,Good and bad,"We ordered this train for my son who is a huge Polar Express fan. The first one we ordered (which he received on Christmas morning), worked for about 20 minutes and then stopped. I contacted Amazon support and returned it very easily for a replacement train. Although the process was easy, I was heartbroken that my son's most prized gift stopped working after 20 minutes and it took some time to get the replacement in. The new train worked fine and has every time we have used it. I wish it was a bit faster, but my son doesn't seem to mind that. It eats through batteries pretty quickly, so if you can get rechargeable, I think that's the way to go. I did love the small details on this train; like the hobo on the roof. Overall, I would buy this again, but only because my son absolutely loves the Polar Express."
1,"Disappointed, Sorry!","What a cute train! I've had the train up for four days. Until yesterday, it has never made it around the track once without shutting down. It says it automatically turns off in ten minutes when not in use. Not so! I had to unplug the engine from the Coal Car and after four days had to change all batteries again.In all fairness, last night, we changed the batteries and it made it around the track four times without stopping. Also, the train cars do not stay hooked. I had to scotch tape the cars together.It's a cute train set and my 5,6 and 7 year old grandsons will love it around the Christmas tree this year, but it's not the Lionel that I remember as a kid. Hope this helps someone."
3,DO NOT BUY FOR CHILDREN UNDER 6,"I purchased POLAR EXPRESS G-GUAGE train for my youngest boy. It was relatively easy to assemble and is very nice looking - but for the money you get short-changed on the amount of track with it. Important note is that it only runs on batteries.However, my son continues to want to lay or sit next to it and with the slightest touch it CONSTANTLY FALLS OFF THE TRACK!!!!! Also if you accidently touch the track it unsnaps. I have put this entire thing back together so many times I have lost count.I will keep it because he loves it anyway but I would not recommend buying this for any children under 6 - this item only designed to look at only."
3,READ before you buy,This is a great train but Note it does NOT have smoke and it is the Plastic Toy version of the O-scale electric die cast metal one. it is battery wich makes it safe for younger children my 3 year old son loves it. and if you use the 9.6v battery option it with run faster and longer.the range on the wireless remote is very poor.
5,Awesome Starter Train - fun for all,My husband and daughter had a blast putting together the track and playing with the train. I also purchased additional track and it took up my entire living floor space. It was amazingly cool. Looking forward to adding additional cars and engines to the track.
5,Love this train!,This is a great product! We got this product to go under our Christmas tree. It is fun and easy enough for our two year old to operate. We look forward to putting it under our tree every year!
4,Amazon Customer Service is the BEST,"This is more a review about Amazon.com than anything else. The train set is decent and a great ""starter"" train for a child in the 3-8yr old range. I highly recommend getting the rechargeable battery pack as the unit burns through the C-cell batteries at a frightening pace. We had one issue with the unit in that it stopped working correctly after about one month. When I went to Lionel for help (and one of their local authorized service stores) I got absolutely no where. I contacted Amazon.com and explained my situation and they replaced the entire train set in less than one week. I am so impressed with their handling of this situation that I will be making as many of my future purchases through them as possible."
2,Not happy with purchase,"Train engine light does not work nor does it make any sounds. Was assured that this deal was a return-more of an open-box type of deal, and that everything would be inspected and in working order. That just didn't happen. Disappointing to say the least to my four-year old grandson."
3,okay,"product itself was great, however the batteries that come in the box were horrible and need to be replaced right away"
1,lionel polar express train set- g gauge,"I don't really hate it but it did not work , we tried new batteries , bought a rechargeable battery. It would start run for 5 minutes turn off and not turn on so for a christmas gift , it was disappointing for my grandson. We returned it."
1,Very poor quality,I wished I would have purchased this train through Amazon as I would have had recourse for return. I bought this extremely poor quality train set through Lionel. It worked for ONE week and when I contacted Lionel I got zero help. I guess a lesson learned.
4,"Good train, weak motor","Listen up! If you run the tracks on carpet, your train may seize up repeatedly before reaching full acceleration. Move the tracks to a flat surface. I'm talking even a millimeter of unevenness was throwing our train off - other reviewers had this same problem.The motor is just barely powerful enough to reach full speed on a perfectly flat surface. As others have reported, it will simply stop if you run this on carpet that's not perfectly flat. That said, everything else about this train is great and it's worth getting for someone who loves trains.Lots of attention to detail with sounds and the train itself, especially if you've seen the movie. My son loves it, aside from all the troubleshooting we had to do at first."
1,lionel how about little more for your money except plastic,I am disapointed i bought train to add to bachman big hauler and when i did not see anywhere this was plastic tracks the O scale was alway quality i trusted in lionel until now so now i have to use for under tree[...] i could of got addition to g scale in hobby room also afer reading report i see it was plastic tracksi used zoom could not find on box G scale should only be metal tracks others should be called toyssincerly angry train railroader TS
4,lionel quality,"this is a good starter train for children under 6-8 years, as it is simple to put together and operate. it is fairly detailed, but is less likely to have parts broke off than the smaller scales. it seems a little slow, but very functional. i was sad to see that like too many toys in the U.S.A., it is made in china instead of our great country. but thats another story."
4,Fun for kids all ages.,"I have always wanted a train to go around my Christmas tree and I think I have purchased the perfect gift for that purpose. The G-Gauge and the size of the oval layout are just right. Like everyone else I was sceptical after reading all the negative reviews but with the $86 price tag and free shipping I thought ""why not, risk it, it's Christmas"". Well I don't know who had the bigger grin, my wife when she opened it Christmas Eve or my 2 year old granddaughter when she saw it Christmas morning. The child got such a thrill pressing the buttons for sound. We left it up for 10 days and played with it all the time. She even kissed it when we put it away for the year. There were no problems running it on carpeting. True it came unhitched in reverse but running it forward presented no problems. I would recommend this train set for kids of all ages."
4,Great train!,"Made my 4-year old son's day on Christmas morning when it was running under the tree, just like in the movie. The batteries that come with it are of low quality. Once you replace them, the train goes much faster than with the packaged batteries."
4,"Good for the money, exactly what I was looking for","I was looking for a big scale train for around our Christmas tree. This train was exactly what we hoped for. Detailed, big scale, easy to set up and take down, and had a lot of neat details and features. I am not sure how long it works on batteries yet, but it can also use a rechargeable battery pack (not included). The train looks great around our tree, and I am completely satisfied, and pleasantly surprised by this purchase. The only thing I would advise is that it is more of a toy train/novelty type of train. If you are a serious train collector or looking for something more expensive, this may not be the train for you. It is mostly plastic and not meant to be an expensive, top grade product...it is good for the price."
3,Hmm... it is OK,"For the price I paid, I expected more. But my son is very happy with it and, in the end, that is what matters.At first, the locomotive and the tender arrived looking like they were melted and were not working. I contacted the seller and they promptly replaced them! It is frustrating to receive something defective, specially when you believe you paid a lot for it and for the shipping, but it compensates when the company that sold you the thing understands and respects your expectations and does everything to erase the bad first impression.Even though it is made of plastic, the details are impressive. The next one may be a metal one though. So far, the original batteries are lasting; no problem with that as other reviews mentioned. The tracks fit to each other without any problem and the train has not fallen off them a single time until now."
5,Polar Express Train Review,This train was bought as a gift and the person really enjoyed the train. It was his first train since he was a boy.
4,"I love it, the kids love it!","I got this item from another vendor for 59$. I find that it was well worth the money. My 2yr old can operate it and my 9 and 5 year olds love it as well. The ""all aboaaard!"" really makes it for me. We watched the movie after putting the train together and it was just a fantastic experience."
1,Christmas Disappointment,"What a disappointment. Our three year old fell in love with The Polar Express story this year. Since we were ready to get him a starter train set we figured what better one. So on Christmas Eve my brother-in-law who is an expert model train collector helped me set it up. We got the track connected with no problem. Problem was we could never get the train to start or lights to come on. Switched out the C batteries that came with it. Also used the rechargeable battery I purchased. Neither worked. Looking at it, even if it had started, I don't think the cars would have stayed connected or on the track. What was supposed to be the centerpiece of our son's Christmas day gifts was a major disappointment."
1,JUNK WASTE OF MONEY DIDNT WORK AND MADE CHILD CRY ON CHRISTMAS,"I bought this for my five year old. it was all she wanted for Christmas, she watched the movie 53 times. Opened at set it up Christmas Eve, tracks kept falling apart, finally got it all together and the batteries in it, and then lo and behold the piece of crap did not work, so ran out to Walgreens and spent another 15 bucks on c batteries and STILL the only thing i got were lame sounds and a front light, no coal light no movement nothing. Christmas morning was horrible, thank God she had other gifts but she cried over this train most of the day. I emailed Lionel and recieved a response the next day ? go get new batteries ( hello I wrote you that I did) and that I should run in in another room. Really? idiots! Thank you KMART for taking this piece of junk back. NEVER EVER will I EVEr buy anything from these people again."
1,My train worked around 1hr and it broke,"I bought a train, and it worked around 1hr and it broke. I tried change the batteries but it does not work anymore. I'm very disappointed with this because my son got bad because of this."
1,Factual Review - absolutely horrible,"One of the most disappointing purchases I have ever made..I bought this with the hope of seeing the look on my kids face at Xmas time, but when it came time for it to work, the polar express should have a one way ticket to chapter 11..Tracks made from crappy plastic, don't snap together but rather just sit together. When you do this over ten times the plastic WILL wear and break. Also, the track doesn't stick together, it just falls apart..absolute junkTrain seems ok, but falls off the track due to extremely poor craftsmanship (don't expect much, and NO it's not made in the USA anymore folks, all made in mass in china)Overall extremely disappointed,"
2,Disappointed with Polar Express Train.,"I loved it at first but it quit working properly after about 20 minutes total of use. The remote quit working and shut off the train power. I tried all new batteries but that didn't make any difference. I also could not get the optional rechargeble 9 volt to fit. I hated to send it back but am scared to try another one. Also, UPS charged $22.37 to box and return it even with the shipping paid for. I would like to be reimbursed for that please. Thanks."
1,doesn't work,What a disappointment for a 3 year old boy on Christmas morning. I read the reviews on this before I purchased and even though there were several negative comments there were many good comments. We got it put together and the engine didn't make it around the track once without disconnecting from the other cars. On the second lap around the engine quit moving...what I piece of junk! I changed the batteries and nothing changed. I am sending it back.
2,A hassle and a disappointment,"When I first received the set (to be used with my grandkids), it was missing a piece of track. Amazon's solution was to send me an entire second set with instructions to open it, fish out the part I needed, pack it back up, and send it back. I did that.Once I had all the pieces, I found it was very difficult to get the cars coupled and keep them on the track, especially the locomotive. I did get it to run for maybe 20 minutes. Then it wouldn't go, and none of the fixes suggested in the instructions helped.This was to be the first train set I had in about 50 some odd years, and it was a big disappointment."
2,A disappointing Christmas present,"We bought this train for our grandson - his one & only present from us. He was so excited to open it. Excitement turned to disappointment when it stopped running after 15 minutes. A change of batteries didn't help. Amazon offered a refund. Not helpful . He wanted the train. My daughter-in-law called Poittery Barn for Kids the day after Christmas and they very happily exchanged the broken train for a new one. It has been running ever since. Thank you, Pottery Barn."
5,great train set,great set . kids loved it . no issues. easy to put together . great features with horn and whistle .
5,Excellent,"Wonderful book. Fun to read, and easy to understand Algebra. I bought this book for my middle school daughter, but my husband and I are also enjoying this book. We wish that we had had this book when we were studying algebra!"
2,Not a good book to study with,"I bought this book and the Preparing for the Texes PreK-4 Certification by Janice Nath. That is the book you need to get, not this one. I was so frustrated with this book and not being able to answer the questions correctly. The ones on the test weren't even as hard as the ones in this book. I was studying for the EC-4 test. I lost confidince after working in this book. But after studying in Nath's book I felt great and passed the test the first time. Don't buy this book for the EC-4 test."
1,The Blue Print For Failure PPR,"This is the worst study guide I ever read before. Is not aligned with any of the objectives that the new test includes. Besides is very incongruent with the concepts presented, differs a lot with the concepts of the real test. I felt horrible when I arrived to take the test and I couldn't perform at a good level, I felt totally frustrated and unprepared. As advertised this book is your Blue Print for Test... FLUNK."
5,so cute,I really like this activity mat. It's cute .. tactile ... and my son (3 mo.) seems to really like it. probably no better than the other ones out there as far as he's concerned - but I like the funky design :-). I also like that it's reversible ( black-and-white patterns on one side .. bright colors on the other) so I can flip it around for something new.
3,"Cute, but not worth the $$$",I decided to splurge and buy this playmat for my son. Overall I like it but it's not worth the price tag.Pros:- Very cute- Sits high so baby can sit under it- Easy to set up and take down- Comes with a very handy carry bag.- velcro toys are a nice touch- mat has several texturesCons:- VERY expensive- doesn't come with many toys. For the price there needs to be more rings and toys that hang.- the only way to hang toys down the legs is to use the velcro attachments. the mat only comeswith two toys with the velcro attachment.- toys aren't that interactive- additional zolo toys are very expensive. The zolo mirror toy is $20 for it alone!I wouldn't buy this again if I did it over. Way overpriced.
5,Great play mat,I can't say enough about this item. My grandsons love it. It's the first one I've seen that is totally safe and easy to set up and pack up. I am glad I bought it.
3,Entertaining but overpriced and rips easily,"We got this for our little one when he was 2 months old. He loved it at the time and got a lot of tummy time in on it. He's now 6 months old and still occasionally uses it but has lost interest in the mat itself. He still enjoys the toys separately though, and the hanging toys are handy to hang onto the car seat handle. The colors are nice, the orange part is super soft, but makes a lot of lint.It does not come with the water filled toy anymore like the photo shows.It comes with a mirror, a heart shaped rattle, 2 peekaboo toys, and a butterfly and two birds that hang on the ""arms"".My issue is that the blue ""water"" satin part ripped about 2 months in. It's pretty ridiculous for that price.Also, the other zolo toys are expensive, if you want to add hanging toys."
3,Read the First Two First,"I picked this up because on the cover it is compared to Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. Indeed, there are many similarities: time travel from the 20th century to 18th century Scotland, the Jacobite Rebellion, romance, etc. One more similarity: I think it would be more enjoyable had I read the first two books in the series first. Unfortunately it did not say on the cover that it was 3rd of 3. I thought it was the first.That said, it was still a good read, and I have ordered the first two to make up for my not reading them first. Dylan is a hero we can relate to, with passion for his wife (sadly deceased in the book) and his two children. He has also traveled through time and chosen to stay in the 18th century (see another Gabaldon resemblance?). He attempts to make a difference in the outcome of the Rising, as he has knowledge of how things will end.Bottom line, I wish I had read the first two first!! I hope that reading them will make this book seem even better!"
5,a Toubaab fan!!,"You!If you really want to make it in record sales, please produce more albums such as le Grand Bal. (Maybe english or french translations in the booklets would be nice). Also please release albums that you make in Senegal for the Senegalese population such as Baa Taay, which you cannot find on the internet. I had to buy it at one of your concert. Those are truly superior. You are cheating your public. Stop the watered down crap. And please Pascal Obispo duets... ... never again... ... at least leave the music arrangements alone and let him sing and play YOUR music not HIS."
3,I couldn't rate it,I recieved it broken due to mishandling by DHL. but I was lucky by paying insurance I've been compensated.
3,Simple,"This was a short, sweet and innocent romance that should bring you a few hours worth of reading pleasure. A very simple love story about a heiress-turned-pauper camp counselor and an apple picker with money to spare. It isn't an outstanding book or fine fiction or literature, but it's Nora Roberts and worth a read to see how she has matured as a writer."
3,romantic but lame,a nice book - not one of Nora's better ones. I usually read NR books several times before discarding. This probably won't get a second read.
3,"Old, dated book",This is a very old book which I had read years ago. It did not improve with age - just so-so.
1,oh my god,I have to say that I love Nora Roberts as a writter and love all her books very much. This book was so awful. First you have Chase the neighbor jumping on her in the middle of an orchard and basically attacking her. Through out the whole he always attacking her. They only talk a few times and all of a sudden they are love?? Give me a break! I love to read and usually get a tleast 2 or 3 reads out of a book but I had to pitched this one in the trash.
3,its an older story,"yet it was a good one. if youre on the look out for strictly romance with nothing other than that going on, this is the one for you ::smile"
4,Awesome Nora Roberts!,This was a fun read from Nora Roberts. I loved the heiress and the romance was as spicy and hot as usual. I am on a mission to read all of Nora's books!
3,Not bad...,"The sound quality of these speakers is really not the best. Music sounds extremely tinny. However, it looks really nice with my HP L1906 monitor. I didn't even use the provided screws to mount it,it just slid into place."
2,HP 2T Flat Panel Speaker Bar,"Nice looking and streamlines well with my LCD.Sound is another matter, ok for computer - but really tinny when it comes to playing music. Not happy with it at all."
4,Nice,"The shoes are pretty. I bought a pair of brown. It looks cute. But it is 1/2 size larger to me. The heel is 3 inches. It is a little bit tiring after a whole day's wear. One thing I don't like is that it is below my ankle, so there is a gap between the shoes and my ankle. They could be designed higher. Overall they are nice given the price ($25 I paid) and the quality."
5,"Excellent service, great boot","I received my boots fast, and there is no way to beat the incredible price on Amazon. What a great find!"
4,Buttons too hard to push,"Like other reviewers' experiences, my daughter (14 months) can't push the right buttons. She actually presses the buttons that change the mode from colors to numbers to music. I do like it though because the sound is great and I enjoy the songs....as does she. I especially like the musical medley that plays several classical songs....kinda works as a mobile now that she's too old for traditional ones."
5,Life saver,"My husband and I love this toy...and of course my son does too!!! It is wonderful while you are in the car. My son kicks his feet and smiles ear to ear when he sees it coming! However I will say this toy is parent guided because childrens little hands cannot push the buttons. And it also is supposed to fit on your stroller, but doesn't work at all with my Graco stroller. I still love the product!"
4,A lifesaver with my infant,"This toy has been one of my infant son's favorites since he received it for Christmas at age 5 months. He is now almost 11 months, and still loves it. He has always been a highly sensitive baby, and we have struggled with a lot of fussiness. However, this musical toy became a lifesaver for us in the car, during physical therapy sessions, and has even helped put him to sleep many times. The classical music has become familiar and soothing to him,and he still smiles at the caterpillar's cute face. This toy is very durable, colorful, and has many different little tunes, so there is not too much repetition. The carrying handle is nice, and it can also be attached to a crib. I like the volume adjustment as well! My only complaints would be that the numbers are hard to push for little hands, and it is not easily cleaned. Nevertheless, a really great, educational toy for infants."
2,If only the buttons were easier to press I would give it 5 stars,"I personally love this toy. It's cute, the music is pleasant and it makes learning fun. The only bummer, and it's a major bummer, is it's hard for my child to press the buttons - and she's 15 months old! The only one she can easily press is the first button. The rest of the buttons have too much padding in front of them and a small area to press to activate it. It makes her frustrated and upset when she tries to press the other buttons and can't. Toys are supposed to be be fun not frustrating. Every once in a while she gets one of the other buttons to work. But I find she doesn't play with it very often probably because it's not much fun for her. I'm hoping that as she gets older it will be easier for her to work it. I can't believe they rate this toy for 3+ months. I hope something positive will come from this toy and she'll learn not to give up! =)"
4,"Interesting toy, strong on music education","At 4 months my daughter mostly enjoys the music, the big yellow smiley face and banging away at the tabs which make a noise (she especially likes the jingles and the flower rattle). I'll be interested to see how much use and learning she gets out of it as she grows older. It seems like a varied and entertaining basic educational toy with lots of different sounds and functions, leaning heavily on musical education. The classical music section identifies composers by name, which I love because though many baby toys utilise the classics few identify them or give them any credence as anything other than baby muzak; the color learning section has a song in different musical genres for each color, which are identified by name (reggae/jazz/barbershop etc.) As a sometime singer who is daughter to a classical pianist, I hope my daughter has inherited the family music gene and this toy appealed to me because of its concentration on early musical learning."
4,"Cute toy but hard to ""push""","My son received this from Santa back in 2005. He likes it but has a hard time pushing the numbers and colors to make it do anything. I think the age is 6mo plus. I figure the plus is to get the finger strength to use it. The rest is just for show. He has always enjoyed ""looking and listening"" to this toy but as far as interacting ...not happening at 6mo. He is now 17.5 and has given up."
3,there are 2 volume settings,"in response to the previous review, there are 2 volume settings- inside where you change the batteries. Everyone say how wonderfull the sound is. Wrong! I don't know if it's just mine, but I tried about 4 of them in the store. They all sounded like my cellphone tunes. I thought that it's the batteries, so I changed them. Still, clarity leaves to wish a lot better. To whoever considers buying it: check the sound beforehand, see if you like it."
4,Good but too loud,"My 4 year old son and 2 year old daughter both like this toy very much because it is soft, colorful and the selections of music are pretty. The quality of instruments sounds is a lot more lively than most other musical toys. The only negative thing is that I wish they have made two levels of volume, so we can have a choice when we are in a quieter mood!"
2,Buttons are too hard to push!,My daughter was never able to play with this toy on her on. I got it for her when she was 7 mos old ... she's now 16 mos old and gave up on it a long time ago. It just doesn't work unless I push the buttons for her. Other than that - it's a really cute toy! But it's not made for babies.
1,TOO HARD 4 LITTLE HANDS TO PUSH BUTTONS,"My 8mos old has had this toy since he was born, he has never been much interested in it. He'll look at it, grab at the flowers hanging from the bottom but quickly loses interest after a few seconds. He can't seem to push the buttons to make the darn thing sing or talk. I must press them down, hard I must say, to make the thing go for a few seconds. Then it's over. So far, this toy has not been a good purchase AT ALL.I see the wonderful reviews it gets, so I'm hoping he'll begin to play with it some month. Maybe when he's over a year, maybe...."
5,Great Crib Toy,"Our son just started sleeping in his own room & we often hear the jingling of the Counting Pal in the morning. We were worried about transitioning him from his bassinet to his crib but the counting pal seems to keep him happy when he wakes up. He is still a little small to push the body to make the music play but I'm sure that's just around the corner. Great toy, highly recommended."
3,Buttons Too Difficult to Push,"This toy is mildly entertaining. My son likes to play with the purple flowers and orange butterflies. He is 10 months old and still is not strong enough to push the buttons to make the toy sing. The music is somewhat entertaining, however I have to make it play for him -- which is not what I am looking for in a toy."
2,What a scream!,"I like the idea of the toy, but my daughter hates it. Every time it plays she scrunches up her face and starts screaming. The first time I pushed the button for her I thought that she wasn't in the mood to play, but I have tried to get her to play with it at other times of the day and other days, but she still scrunches up her face and screams. The lady's voice that is singing on it is kinda scary. My advice to anyone who is considering this or any toy that makes noise. Take your little one with you and test it out in the store. I have found one other toy that she reacts this way to, so now I know to see if she likes it before we leave the store."
2,Pass on this toy,This was given to me as a present and I am glad I did not waste my money on it. My son cannot press the buttons to make the toy play. If you have a Graco stroller it will not fit on it. He really does not play with it.
3,Hmmm....,"This toy is really good to put on the infant child carrier, my daughter played with it all the time, but I would always have to squeeze it to get it to play music for her, and driving down the road and pushing a toy is kinda dangerous! She batted at the toys that dangled in front of her, but to this day she still can't squueze the numbers for the songs. Not really worth the $20 we payed for it!"
5,My son loves this toy!,"I bought this for my son about a month ago when he was 3 months old. He instantly started grabbing for it and like to feel the material. The counting and color songs are so cute, I sometimes find myself humming them through out the day. Yes, the buttons are a little hard at first, however, they seem to loosen up the more he plays with it. I have not been disappointed with any of the Leapfrog products. Great job."
5,Excellent value toy,"This was my daughter's favorite toy from 3months until 9 months old. Now at 12 months she doesn't play with it as much but it still brings a smile to her face. I love the variety of songs, 16 total. For the price, you don't find many toys with this many tunes. The songs for the color and numbers are original too. Many toys play the same old songs (wheels of the bus, abc..) The musical medley is the best because it's long enough so you get something quickly done (make a bottle, run to the bathroom, change a diaper). I loved how portable it was. I could strap it to the handle of her carseat, the arches of her playmat and the side of her crib. It is soft, colorful and great for any infant."
4,Great toy but button 'area' too small,"I have a 20 month old who loves this toy. She likes to play with it i the car. But, she gets frustrated with it because the button area is very small - it is not the entire number, but only the size of a small watch battery. So, she often resorts to switching the modes since those buttons are easy to find. I often end up pushing buttons for her (when I am not driving). Maybe it would be best for it to stay at home, where she can easily search for the button. Recomended for quiet time at home."
4,Needs longer straps,"I love the variety of features this toy has! The only drawback I found is that the velcro straps (used to attach to strollers, etc.) are not long enough to go around the Graco LiteRider stroller bar. I also wish they would make the straps convertible to not only fit onto a stroller bar, but also to somehow clip onto a larger infant seat."
3,Disappointed,"My 7 month old daughter is strong enough to pull herself up, but she is not strong enough to activate the toy. I have to press fairly hard myself to get it to work. It is a wonderful concept and she loves to hear the rhymes, but it would be nice if she could do it herself. We also have trouble with one of the buttons. It occasionally starts at the end of the song instead of the beginning or says welcome instead of playing the music. I love all of our other Leap Frog products, but this is not one that I would recommend."
2,Not suitable for learning,"Not very engaging; unsuitable for a beginner. Try Latin for Beginners, from Teach Yourself publishers, for a true introductory course. ""Learn Latin"", on the other hand, is just someone writing about the grammar of the language. Nice, but not how you learn. A bunch of newspaper columns bound together in a book with a new fancy cover, isn't enough to learn anything, much less a highly inflected ancient literary language quite different from English."
3,a mixed bag...,"There's some soft, soulful house with vocals, odd old school techno rave sounds (like Strings 2000), a bit of trancey stuff, and one or two harder vocal tracks. It's nice to have the Johnny Vicious mix of Gigi D'Agostino in a pretty length version on disc. There's the pretty trance vocal of St. Etienne on a Paul Van Dyke track. Things with a very pretty but cheesy cover of Elton John by a male vocalist. Not my favorite of the series-I think these discs work better when the music is all of one variety trance/hardhouse/nrg, etc.1. horny hustle (4:56)2. Come On (4:41)3. Somebody Found love (6:22)4. Harvest for the World (9:06)5. Bad Habit (5:19)6. Tell me now (4:32)7. France 2000 (5:38)8. I'll Fly With you (7:55)9. Strings 2000 (8:49)10. Tell me Why (5:35)11. Don't Let The Sun Go Down (6:01)"
1,The DJ is Hiding Behind the Mask...,"I have the entire Global groove series from Centaur and so I naturally bought Mask when it was released. I wanted to like it. I tried to like it. I just can't help but dislike it. Unlike much of the dance music from this period, the vocals are weak, the choice of mixes just down right odd, and the transitions are anything but smooth. Mark MacEwan was never a big dj outside of Atlanta and after this cd was released clubs here stopped booking him cold. That's probably the most telling review of all."
3,beheading a llama a bit too much for family entertainment,"the music part is creative. The band interview, ok if you like watching people hurt themselves using narcotics, i.e. pot, speed, etc. The excerpt where the llama is killed is not music either. This DVD is not for anyone under 16, they won't understand the drug use"
2,What a disappointment,"ok, first off ATB is some of the best electronic music i've ever heard. I would just like to make that clear becuase im not slammin' them. I bought this album without really looking at the song titles too closely, which was a big mistake. i could tell right away that this cd was comprised of remixes from other DJs all put into one uniteresting, unoriginal, repetitive, difinitly not-ATB worthy album. the bass drops are ALL the same. in get really mind numbing after a while. dont get me wrong, i love trance music, but this is just bad. go for a great album like ""no silence"" by ATB, if you dont have it get it, you'll love it. save this one for the posers."
4,atb satisfies again...,"this compilation was some of the best trance/pop i have listened to in awhile. Andre even through in some trance classics (1998, Till i Come) on the second album . It is a very uplifting compilation with paul van dyks piece taking the spotlight. First time i have listened to the club mix and i am thoroughly impressed. Overall, a well deserved four star, but atb's techincal mixing skills left the last star out. Nevertheless, Andre is one of the best out there."
5,Supreme compilation,"Not surprised that one of the best remixers and innovative Djs in the world comes up with an exceptional compilation like this. Superb mixing, and choice of tracks. Each track has its own unique energy and inspiration. ATB is becoming no 1 to me. Sorry PVD , sorry tiesto."
2,dj in the mix? what dj?,"the track selection is fine and okay, but the track order is horrid. No FLOW! proving that he just took popular tracks that other big djs are spinning and sold an album without a smile. the mixing is terrible and abrupt, its basically not mixing. no art there."
5,Great progressive trance,"ATB is not just a great producer of club and trance classics, he's also a pretty accomplished DJ. On this double disc he spins remixed and reworked progressive and uplifting trance for fans of ATB as well as Oakenfold, Blank & Jones, and even Tiesto. The beats are always great four-to-the-floor club bangers while the melodies and orchestrations are simply lush and vibrant. Some track highlights include Everything But the Girl's ""Missing [Todd Terry Club Mix]"", Paul Van Dyk's ""Time Of Our Lives [PVD Club Mix]"", Blank & Jones' ""Summer Sun"", and Metalmaster's ""Is This Hard Enough?"" [Spanishfly Mix]"". It's a great introduction to those new to trance music and is also essential for those continuing to listen."
2,Not what I expected,"Compared to the demo BB put out with these songs on it, this album is an obviously sad reincarnation of something that was once pure but is now used and sold. The music itself is ok, but the lead singer sounds drained of all life and not into any song on the CD. Also this album was extremely over produced. I was disappointed."
5,Fine Ring Stand,"There is nothing to complain about with this well-made ring stand. As advertised, it is made of either white leather or a plastic similar to leather. The whole piece is glued together well with the ends tucked away securely. It is about 2 inches high, and will fit rings from size 1 to size 9.I have collected a number of jewelry stands so far, and I find that the flocked ones collect all kinds of lint. I cannot even keep up with the collection of lint with a sticky lint roller. As fast as I clear it off, more will collect.This problem is not an issue with this white leather stand. It stays clean and nice and I don't have to keep it in a plastic bag. I would highly recommend it."
4,So easy to use,"I bought the biggest one in the neutral tone and used it for a photoshoot and the pictures looked a lot better than they usually do. I just held it over each lens and took the shot at the light source. Afterwards I still had to adjust the white balance a little, but it was much better than before. Glad I got this!!"
1,awful,"why is rock the casbah on here? I hate to sound like a music elitist, but I don't think Joe Strummer had a goofy halloween song in mind when he penned it. Anyhow, this is awful, awful, awful. It's no good for anyone. Don't give this guy any of your money because it is clear upon first listen that he put more effort at the toilet than in the studio. with that said, drew, go purchase better equipment, or go into the toilet paper industry if you want to produce this kind of garbage."
3,Corny Music Perfect for a Halloween Party,I thought the music was fine for a Halloween party. It's not meant for the music collector. The hokey rendentions play perfectly for a costume party. I marked it down because it should be more up-front that it is not the original performers.
2,"Ideas are good, but nothing revolutionary","The workbook seems to be a ""Readers Digest"" version of the original book. While the questions can be thought-provoking, the stories are a bit predictable and common."
3,The Creative Process,"I ordered this book hoping that it would help to motivate me and get my creative juices flowing. I haven't been able to read too much of it, as I've been busy with other things. It doesn't grab you and get you interested."
2,Interesting but not insightful,"A bit of a disappointment. Anecdotal and reflective, but not really informative about how the process of creativity works. A little bit scholarly and pedantic."
4,All-New Alien Action,"It's an all-new movie based on the cool series ""Ben 10 Alien Force"" called ""Ben 10 Alien Swarm"".In this movie Ben (Ryan Kelley) meets an old friend of his that needs his help. However, Gwen, Kevin, and even Grandpa Max don't trust her. But Ben, along with his new and improved Omnitrix, will prevail once he saves humanity from imminent destruction from another planet.This is a pretty cool movie next to ""Ben 10: Race Against Time"". This DVD has a music video by There for Tomorrow and some behind-the-scenes features, too !So get this movie if you like the Alien Force spin-off to Ben 10. And look for more new episodes on Cartoon Network."
2,Silly,"Good for little kids. Overall, I thought it was silly with bad acting. I enjoy watching the cartoons better with my son."
2,Ben 10 Alien Swarm,"I have never seen this series, so I didn't understand what was going on. I probably would not recomment this one unless they understand the series and have watched it on Cartoon Network."
3,okay,I have read a few other books by Ms Rice and have enjoyed them much more. Maybe this one was just a little to dark for me. I never really got to the point where I cared much for any of the characters. But I will certainly try Ms Rice again!
4,here's the book description....,"Her real name was Lady Alexandra Theodora Beaumont, the daughter of an abusive British Lord. Rescued from drowning by Kentucky Quakers little ""Dora"" was disguised as a typical Quaker child and no one knew of her first years - not even Pace Nicholls, ""bad boy"" son of a local slavholder. And from the day they met, whereever Pace was, so was Dora who grew to womanhood pining for his love. Pace was hellion as a boy and a rebel as a man. He freed the family slaves and left his law practice to join the Union Army. And Dora was always there ready to nurse his wounds. His had no excuse for taking her in wanton self indulgence without giving his heart, never guessing that the tables would one day turn. He never guessed that the noble and beautiful lady Alexandra could be swept forever out of his reach unless this time eh offered his heart."
3,Explorer. Animals of Africa,The problem is that the recording is very old (of the 1973) and one wait a modern sound that makes it be transported to the place of the facts.
3,only animal sound,"Tiene un sonido bueno , pero se encuentra aislado del sonido normal de fondo, no lo consideraria como ambiental , es mas bien educativo."
1,What's going on with this CD,It is unbelievable that this track was released. I know that Marvin is singing but it sounds like he singing at a backyard barbeque using a bullhorn.Who in the world produced this fiasco? I am certain it was not MARVIN GAYE!
2,Horrible Sound Quality,Contains a list of great songs but the sound quality is HORRIBLE. Not only is it live but scratchy also. I am very dissapointed. Do not waste your money.
2,Poor Recording,"I couldn't get the full vibe of the disc.it was very poorly recorded.it's more like a bootleg disc than a real Professional sounding one.I'm a Big Marvin Gaye Fan,The Man was one of the Greatest Teachers of Music.he deserves to be Treated as such not a Poor Recording like this.I'll just bump Live at the London Palladium.skip this one.the 2 is because of a hearing his voice.the rest is a zero."
3,"The performance isn't bad, but the recording is","Marvin's vocal performance isn't his best. However, ""God is My Friend"" is wonderful on this CD."
1,"Junky piece of plastic, leaks and wets itself","I was shocked to see this thing for over 25$. I have had several and bought them for a few dollars each time. They are only useful for small oddly shaped areas you have seeded or flowerbeds. For a few dollars they are ok, for 20 dollars don't even consider it."
4,"The other ""school"" book","A lot's been made of the fine ""A Separate Peace,"" but ""A Good School"" brings Yates' eye -- which was one of the best, most unheralded of 20th century American writers -- to the twists of coming of age in a prep school. Nobody captured the shades and shadows of dialog like Yates, and few have made characters of any age so vivid in their grappling with pain and yearning. Anyone who's ever been a teenager will devour this novel.That Richard Yates never made the gears of New York turn for him is an error of the publishing industry that's impossible to calculate; that ""A Good School"" is not mandatory reading for anyone interested in young people is a loss to every reader of the genre."
3,What's the fuss?,"This is a perfectly ordinary story about a geeky young man who finds his place in the world of a boys' prep school. None of the characters are remarkable, neither is the plot or, apparently, the themes. Except for the sexual explicitness, this could have been a Young Adult novel. Stick with The Rector of Justin, The Catcher in the Rye or A Separate Peace."
2,Homage to Hahtor,I did not like this cd because de vocals overpowered the music.The harp melody is repetitive.It really did not grab my soul.
3,An under-rated series,"This series by Harry Turtletaub is in my opinion quite under-rated and under-read, judging by the number of reviews. They are a bit sophomoric, but that's just the right age for teenagers who will be this book's best audience. Charming books. Recommended as a light read on the one hand and as an intriguing enticing intro to ancient history on the other."
4,Book of Revelation (New Century Bible Commentary),"This is a reprint of the classic commentary by G.R. Beasley-Murray. An excellent exegetical work from a historical premillenial view-point [premillenial, but non-dispensational]."
4,good stuff,"seeing how this is the only live dvd the pumpkins have released so far, its worth buying for that alone. however, the is the ""edited"" version of the dvd and instead of muting his vocals the sound drops out altogether, which is a bit disappointing. another downer is that in the ""lost 94 tapes"" the sound drops out near the end when billy sings the song ""over the rainbow"" (i guess for legal purposes.)with those aside, the performances are great including the acoustic versions of ""mayonaise"" and ""cherub rock."" and the skits are funny as well, such as the ""meet the frogs"" sketch. if you can't get ahold of the uncut version, this is the nest best thing."
5,The best investment you'll ever make!,"This book is a MUST read for anyone preparing to negotiate salary. It gives easy to read ""plain talk"" instruction on how to effectively negotiate salary. I was pleasantly surprised to see how well the strategies discussed in the book actually work!!"
4,Very Trendy Scale,I bought the scale for my trainer. I use the scale to weight in each week. The scale seems very accurate and easy to use
1,Horrible Scale!,"This is the most horrible scale that I have ever purchased. I weigh around 100 lbs, yet it tells me that I weigh from 6 (yes six!) to 115 lbs. Every time I step on this scale, even within minutes, it gives me a different reading. Many many calls to the manufacturer have gone answered. I left many messages but no one ever called back. I have wasted many batteries on this! I would never suggest this to anyone."
4,Good Bargain.....,"The scale does everything it says it will. The calculations aresomewhat general, based on how you set-up your personal info, but itdoes serve as a good guide for weightloss."
4,Taylor Scale,"I like this scale a lot because it is easy to use, lightweight and very accurate. I bought it for a very good price and love the free shipping that Amazon offers."
2,just ok,"I broke it as soon as I tried to pop the back open to put the battery in. Then after I got it to work, I put my info in but the numbers flash quick and its hard to tell what they mean without either having the instructions in your hand or bending over to see the tiny writing. Please don't get off and pick the machine up to read it because it does not save the info. the screen will just go blank."
3,Taylor Scales,"This is a nice looking scales. It looks better than the picture. I have also found it to be accurate.However, you have to be careful when you unwrap the battery. It connects with a little spring that can spring right out of the scales.I haven't been able to use any other features other than the weight reading. Maybe it is because I haven't made my feet moist enough, but that is not convenient for me. Also, I thought it would light up. I usually have to light up the room so that I can see the numbers, but my eyes are not as good as they used to be."
1,Very Accurate Reading (I thought),"I wrote my review a few years ago and while it was great when I first got it, it quickly went down hill. This product is not very accurate."
4,NICE SCALE,"This is really more than what I needed, but at the time the price was good. I could have done with just a simple weight display. I found this one too much trouble to get back to my profile setup. If your're looking just to monitor weight loss, get a different model."
5,"Part of the ""Illustrated Home"" series","With over 500 illustrations, ""Structure, Roofing and the Exterior"" shows you exactly what the finished job should look like.Alan Carson and Robert Dunlop prove in this easy-to-use book that pictures really are worth a thousand words. Through clearly detailed illustrations Carson and Dunlop walk you through your home, showing you just what your repairs and renovations should look like, inside and out. This book is an excellent tool for the new home owner or home inspector, showing you which pitfalls to avoid and what to look for when searching for potential problems in the structure, roof or exteriorof your or your client's home."
3,Would have been great 10 years ago,"This book would have been much more insightful 10 years ago, but alas globalization is no longer a new phenomenon."
1,New edition printed on Gold Leaf?,"Back in print, but for who I wonder: Every listing I see for this book is grand or more, I can't believe there could possibly be any content worth 1800 dollars.I would like to review this book, but who the hell can afford 1800$ for one book? ahh I see, the new edition was printed on gold leaf...I gave it one star to protest the ridicuosly high price."
3,OK but many typos and wrong screen captures.,"The book was helpful in giving an overall flow of how to use JSP to get the big picture. The typos were distracting and the wrong screen captures and references to wrong file names made it hard to follow examples. Didn't anyone proof this book? It is a bit out of date and I would not have bought it if I knew this. However, it did have redeeming points."
1,AWFUL,Had to learn JSP from this book for work. Only good part is I've been paid for the wasted hours I've spent working around the numerous errors in the text/code/EVERYTHING. Worst book I've ever had to learn from.
2,usual unedited hungryminds book,"This book is published by hungryminds which is the same company that produces the ""For Dummies"" books. It seems that all their books are sloppily slapped together and poorly edited. Just one example from this book: the screenshots for one chapter appear in the next chapter. Contrary to what one reviewer stated, there are mistakes in the code. I estimate that at least every other page has some type of mistake. As is also true of their other books, concepts are discussed which are not defined until several sections later. They say it takes 15 hours to read this book. If that is the case why didn't they spend an extra 15 hours reading it to at least catch some of the more glaring mistakes"
1,"Weekend ""Crash and Burn"" Course","By far, the worst book I've EVER purchased. The editors must have been blind to miss the mistakes that were made in both the screen shots, the code, and the text. The mistakes make it extremely difficult for the novince JSP programmer to learn, correct, and debug while simultaneously absorbing the information. Well, I guarantee that you'll spend more than 15 hours trying to figure out what in the world they're trying to demonstrate! I'm going to stick to WROX, O'reilly, and Sun from now on..."
3,Not the best Kipper!,"We have several Kipper's but this one just doesnt hold my littlies interest like some of the others (Pools, parks and picnics, Cuddly critters etc). Even to me as an adult, it seems to drag a little and I havent watched it all the way through.Also there is a part where Kipper and friend are in a tent and think there is a monster outside, it doesnt bother my 2 yr old but my older child thought it was a little creepy.My advice - choose first from one of the other delightful Kippers."
5,Turbo Spray Bottle,This spray bottle has a very strong spray and works great. No complaints at all. It is also compatible with the Lotus cleaning system.
3,Delicate Spray Bottle,"My sprayer part of the spray bottle has acted up a little but my main complaint is that the actual spray bottle is too delicate. I use mine all the time. When I am cleaning, I accidentally drop the bottle & most of the time it cracks immediately and is useless. This is my 3rd or 4th one to buy! I love the system so I keep buying the spray bottle. At least Amazon has a decent price for the spray bottle. Maybe I could get together with the reviewer who has all the extra bottles & trade her all my extra spray nozzles! Tersano should sell all the parts of the spray bottle separately!"
3,Bottom started to leak,"I still use this product all the time to clean my granite counter tops and it does a great job, but after many uses, the bottom now leaks. I have to make sure to empty the bottle before storing. One of these days I'll buy another. The spry mechanism is great and I love the way this product cleans and sanitizes."
1,deceptive,My son searched Amazon for a Christmas gift for his dad. He saw this and we both thought it was a great idea. He paid me with his hard earned money that he worked a couple of weeks for and I ordered it with my charge card. He waited anxiously for the box to arrive. It did arrive. ONE wrench in a box at least six times its size. ONE wrench. From the picture we thought we were purchasing a SET. Unless you are a mechanic even the description is deceptive. The shipping was $11.25! I thought that was a lot but assumed the set would be heavy and therefor warranted the price. We are both very disappointed. There are other tools on this site pictured individually. I feel that this was not an accident. To charge someone (in this case a child) $42.69 for one wrench is very deceptive. As a frequent shopper of Amazon I am disappointed with the seller and Amazon. I am returning this ONE wrench today. I am curious to see how much the postage will actually be. I hope there are no problems with returning.
3,Good Guitar Work little week on background,"First I would like to say I am a big Manfred Mann's Earth Band Fan. I try and get my hands on anything connected with the band. I was excited to see a solo album by Manfred Mann's Earth Band lead guitar player Mick Rogers. Unfortunatly this CD suffers from the lack of good side musicians and sounds a bit techno and drum machined in places. Mick is a great guitar player and he sounds inspired in places, but something is lacking (again a real band). I would enjoy hearing more of his work outside the Earth Band, but we can't get much in the U.S. Hey Mick how about bringing the Earth Band to the U.S. for a tour. You can see the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame when you play my home town Cleveland."
2,Poorly played,"Given that this wind ensemble is ""professional"", expectations would be set at a certain level for this recording, and the group is nowhere near that level. There are many college wind ensemble recordings that far exceed what is heard on this disc.Problems abound: tuning, ensemble, balance, etc. Compounding these problems are the extremely dry acoustic in which this CD was recorded (absolutely no reverb).Pass on this CD."
4,Smaller but Beautiful,"They turned out to be smaller than I expected, but they are so beautiful! The backside looks kinda unfinished, but I guess you aren't really looking at it. They are comfortable and look wonderful."
5,Lovely,"I love these earrings! They are so beautiful, not too big (I hate big earrings) and the design is wonderful."
5,Lovely,I purchased and gave these earrings to my wife for christmas. She is Irish and she loved them .. that should say it all
3,Looks nice...,...but is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to hide wires in the given area and then attach the plates! Instructions were VERY tiny but easy to understand once I could read them.
1,Absolutely Awful,Dreadful product.Relatively easy to install but if you've got more than one cable there's nowhere to put them.Poorly designed and cheap looking.
3,TV stand,This item is very hard to run the wires and still be able to snap on the covers. One of the holding tabs that connect to the track that attached to the wall broke off while installing.
4,Works as advertised,"I had already bought a Tria 1 at a well known home improvement store, so I felt like I would be satisfied with the Tria 3, based on my previous experience. The price on the Tria 3 was the best I had found. It installed as expected and is as functional as I was hoping for. I was concerned about it's condition when it arrived because it was not packed well and the box was about twice the size it needed to be for the original box size, but the original box packing kept the glass shelves in first class shape, which made me very happy I did not have to deal with a broken shipment claim and delay my installation. I would recommend this unit to anyone needing an attractive and functional wall unit for your system."
4,Modern and funtional,"I love this shelf, it is very functional. I was afraid it would be small, but it was bigger than i anticipated, making it even worth my buck. It hold the PS3, our sound system and our dvd player nicely. We don't have our tv mounted it sits on an entertainment center next to the shelf and it still looks sharp. The only complaint i have is it was a pain in the rear getting the wires to fit. The sound system was where the trouble really came in, all the speakers and such. The huge cable of the PS3 fit fine. You to have to stagger the wires a bit to make them fit, push, pull and try again, it's hard to make the plastic cover clip on with the wires. Oh and i thought bc the cover was plastic it might look cheap, but i wasnt let down. like i said, takes some work, but overall a great buy!"
4,MY FIRST CABLE MANAGEMENT COMPONENT,"ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF MY SON WE BOUGHT 3 OF THESE FOR AFFIXING BELOW THE TV'S IN OUR NEW HOME. BESIDES BEING PLEASING & MODERNISTIC IN APPEARANCE, THEY WERE VERY FUNCTIONAL IN MANAGING/CONCEALING THE CABLES FROM THE VARIOUS BOXES. SO FAR, MANY OF OUR VISITORS HAVE COMMENDED US ON THE MODERN APPEARANCE OF OUR T/V'S."
4,Wow what a nightmare,"I ordered this shelf so I could have a cleaner look in my living room, well lets just say the reviews that mention how hard it was to get the wires behind the clips are so true! it took us at least 2 hours to get it up with all the wires tucked behind now that its up it looks great but damn you should have lots of patience to deal with this shelving unit- I rent an apartment and I may just leave it right here when I leave I can't ever imagine taking it down and putting it back up in a new place. I would look elsewhere for something a bit more user friendly if I buy something new."
2,Poor Cable Management,"Easy to set up and a decent shelving system, but cable management is abysmal. The plastic covers simply do not have enough room for the cables you need. In my case from my TV - power lead, DVI cable, 2 - audio cables. I also have component leads to my DVD player but immediately realized that it wouldn't hold them. I tried with just the TV power, DVI and audio but its a mess. Its also untidy to run cables down the shelf and onto a component on the next shelf (notice you never see this done in any photos). Bottom lime I am in the market for a new shelving system."
1,OMNIMOUT TRIA SHELF,THIS OMNIMOUNT TRIA 3 SHELF WALL SYSTEM IS TOO BIG NOT ATTRACTIVE ON WALL. REALLY HARD TO HIDE WIRES. LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SMALLER
1,Shelves tilt precariously at even 1/4 weight limit,"The 3-shelf Omni-mount is useless. It is rated in the documentation at 30 lbs per shelf (90 lbs total). However at even a quarter of that weight, the shelves tilt downwards at the front under the weight - unsafe, and looks stupid. An amp on a shelf which is approaching the weight limit has a significant tilt.As other reviewers note, the cable covers aren't able to cover more than a couple of cables.The concept and appearance of this is nice, However it simply doesn't deliver."
2,It was broken,"When I received this product, it was broken. One of the plastic cable coverings was cracked and split down the middle. The shelves are sturdy enough for smaller things, but large stereo components do not fit, and are too heavy for the glass."
4,"Sturdy, sleek equipment at a fair price","This is the best shelf for your buck. Looks good...easy installation (less than an hour, and I've never done anything like this before) and you don't have to install it exactly as it looks. You could just do two shelfs or just two brackets instead of three. However, mine did come in BLACK, not clear...just a warning."
2,Good product - Poor installation instructions,"Instead of trying to write the installation instructions in so many languages, it would have been better if they had only chosen two or three languages and write a little bit more thorough instructions.Other than that, the product itself is very good. Solid construction and very good design."
3,not a fake review,I like the shelves they look nice are very durable. however there are 2 things to consider before you purchase this. everything you hear about hiding the cables is true. I used zip ties to tie all my cables together seemed to help this problem but was still a pain. another thing to consider I have an onkyo receiver where most of the weight of the recever is towards the left side causing the shelf to be unlevel. however I am probably the only one to ever notice it. it still bothers me a little bit.
3,Shelves,"These shelves are very nice. There is a small problem though. The shelves lean down, and are not level. Waiting for new brackets to give that a try. They do free up floor space. If the new shelf brackets don't help level the shelves, I'll just shim them up w/some 1/2"" rubber spacers or something."
5,Excellent AV Rack,"Lets say that once installed and looking at what the finished product does is amazing. It took some time to install because of me being so picky. I have a Wii, PS3, XBOX360 and a fios box all on this AV rack and you can barely see some of the wires. It all depends on what you want it to look like. I could have thrown it up and still been happy, but I tend to be a little crazy about seeing wires.Excellent product and installation wasn't bad. My new neighbors have asked were I got it from and are interested in getting one for themselves."
2,Too Small,This shelf is OK for knick knacks but not stereo/home theater components. The shelves are way too small. Even my DVR which is not that big barely fits. My Pioneer Elite Receiver is way too large for the shelves and too heavy for these shelves. Cable management is terrible with not nearly enough space to hide the cables. I really don't know what this unit was designed for but it is too small for any practical use.
3,TV Shelf,"The wire cover design makes it very difficult to install. The unit itself is easy to assemble and install to the wall, but the wire covers make it very difficult as there is no way to snap them in place without cutting them to the proper lengths so that the wires come out to the correct self height. The wire covers shoud be made that the cover either snaps off at desired lengths or make several short ones so that you can make your own desired lengths.Maybe I do not understand how the wire covers are to be installed, but there should be an easier way.The overall unit looks great and is very functional, but the wire covers should be reviewed for lengths/installation process.Jim Brown"
3,"Easy to install, durable, but the wire hiding aspect is not so wonderful.","The product was easy to install, and it seems pretty durable. However, the plastic parts that provide a cover for the wires are not conducive to situations in which you're using thick HDMI cables or high quality RCA's. There is just not enough space to hide the wires and clip the covers on. Once again, great product, but beware if you want to hide all your wiring."
2,Wrong Design,I bought this product but looks like design of this product is not correct. There is no way to hide the wire coming down from back of TV and connected on different shelves.
5,PANTY-DROPPER!!!,"This wall mount was perfect for my master bedroom. It took me maybe 30 minutes to install. Followed directions and made it happen. One thing that i really appreciated about this mount was that i did not take into consideration the length, but since it came in three separate pieces I used only two mount holders, but was able to use all three shelves, i was glad there was still ample space for overbearing components. So even if you purchase this on impulse like i did, you should be good if you are confined to working within a limited space. Lastly, price was perfect, found the same thing at other big box retailers and was overpriced. You will not be disappointed."
3,Not Quite What I Expected,"The final installed product looks fine. However, the cable covers do not have outlets to let wires in and out. Not sure if that is a design oversight or is intentional. I ended up cutting a rectangular hole on each cover using a knife.Most other reviews already discuss the issues with cable management and how hard it is to snap the covers on and off. Overall, the product looks good though the installation was a bit painful."
4,Nice product...,The product is good. ...I used it next to the fireplace and mounted the TV over the fireplace. It worked well
3,Not bad once you get it set up,"This appears to be one of the few on the market. Based my purchase on other reviews and have to concur with them. Instructions are below average at best - you have to figure out a lot on your own. Unit is constructed of solid materials - metal is solid and glass is tempered (actually quite nice). You will have to play with the wire management system a bit to get it to work, and if you have a lot of wires, it will take time to get the faceplate on and to get it on straight. Overall, the item is OK, and for the money probably worth it. I do not think there are a lot of competition out there for these kinds of stud mounts."
3,Not bad for the price,"I think the end result looks pretty good. The instructions for how to put it together were horrible, so you basically have to just look at the pics and figure it out on your own. Then there was a broken plastic part; one of the black pieces that go down the middle. The shipping for it was so horrible and i'm sure thats why it came with the broken (crushed) piece. They sent it in a super huge box, with only some paper to keep the box inside (with the actual unit), from rolling all around. But all in all, for the price i paid, i can't complain. And when i called for a replacement part, i had it in a week. Looks good and keeps everything looking clean and neat."
2,Not so good,this is an okay item for the anount you pay but I wish I would have added a few more bucks for a better product. Its very difficult for the covers to stay put that suppose to hide the wire. Not sure what I can do about that because I can't keep the cover from sliding.
4,Good look and functional...,"I have my computer LAN set up in a 7 foot wide closet with bi-fold entry doors on both wide sides of the closet. I wanted a shelf system for my printer, scanner, etc. that would get these items off the desktop but wouldn't make the space look like an ""office cube"".The glass shelves meet my aesthetic requirements and are quite practical for holding ancillary computer components. The wiring associated with the components are minimal so I didn't encounter the wire management difficulties mentioned by the audio/video enthusiasts' reviews.The shelving system is sturdy, of good quality and reasonable price. No buyer's remorse for me."
3,How to hide all the wires,"I ordered this 3-shelf unit to hold all the peripherals of a new wall mounted TV. The product is attractive, the shelves are glass, the perpendicular wide bars (which the wires hide under) are silver. My complaint is that we are unable to keep the wires hidden under these flimsy bars. They are too small, too plastic, not flexible, difficult to align with each other,and seem to come apart with the slightest movement of anything connected to the wires they are supposed to hide. Good concept, attractive look, bad execution."
4,Great wall mount shelving!,"This is a great unit. Fairly easy to put together, although I did have a bit of trouble with the cabling. All in all it was a great buy."
4,good,"this product is good, specially space saver and keeping a decent look to your room, worth the money!!!!"
4,Stylish and compact,Great look and quality. Fits in small spaces. The only downside is the difficulty in fitting the covers over cables.
4,homemedia,"Nice set of shelves. Installation was easy, however the covers are not aligned so you can see where they connect. Overall it is very useful. Recommended."
5,Great product,"I have this product for 2 weeks. I am very satisfied with it. The shelves are of good size,all my systems comfortably fit into them. The installation guide is a brain teaser but once you get sense of it, installation process is quick and simple.I think it is a great product."
4,"Solid Product, Nice Price","Overall, I am very satisfied with this product. It is constructed very well and looks great too. Adds a very nice touch to a wall mounted flat panel TV."
3,"It works to hold your stuff, but...","The gray cord cover is plastic and has a cheap look to it. I painted mine to suit the wall on which it was hung, which turned out very nice. The mount itself is sturdy, and works well. Some of the instructions are a pain, as with the shelf bumper (between shelf and glass) the illustration and instructions were incomprehensible as the parts I had looked nothing like what the instructions described. The problem I have now is that I can't hide all the wires because the thing just isn't accommodating to more than one or two units, which I have 4 including the video output switch to the projector.So it's nice, nicer if you paint it, and if you don't have too many units to cover wires to."
3,Do you research first!,"This book is an obvious recruiting tool from Excel to bring in new reps to sell their products & services. That's O.K. and actually a good marketing idea. However, before anyone jumps on the bandwagon I strongly suggest you do your research! The internet is a powerful tool for researching Multi Level Marketing as is Amazon.com. Doesn't it make sense to invest a few dollars in a book written about MLM before your fork over a few hundred bucks to work for a company? At the very least, make a trip to the library and check out their books on MLM. The MLM company has absolutley nothing to lose. They keep your ""investment"" regardless. Yes, you can be successful, but first take the time to investigate the opportunity and the industry. If it sounds to good to be true it usually is."
1,I must have bought the wrong book,"There's a great business story about a young man who grows up on the wrong side of the tracks, begs, borrows and steals his way through college and several failed business ventures, yet goes on to found one of the largest telecommunications firms in the world and take his place among the billionaires on the FORBES 400. If you're interested in reading about that story...THIS ISN'T THE BOOK FOR YOU. This is a 200 page brochure for the Excel Business Opportunity without the color glossy pictures. If you're interested in learning how you can join the American Dream, start your own business, work from home and live the lifestyle of the rich and famous by selling long distance service to your friends and neighbors, buy the book. Or save yourself the $20 bucks and attend their next pep rally coming soon to your hometown"
4,Good Intro,"James gives a good background of the company and how this can benefit you. He talked about the past, the present, and the future. He also wrote alot of other books about MLM & other subjects. With any opp you should fine more than one source like the BBB & the DSA. Fine a company that you believe in, because no matter what you do in life there will be people that won't like what you do."
5,This book is about people having choices in life,"James Robinson has done a good job of describing Excel's wild ride to success. He shows the reader how much credibility and integrity this company posesses, and clearly demonstrates that Excel is leading the Network Marketing industry from being misunderstood and on the fringe to mainstream and highly respected.The book illustrates why Network Marketing, and Excel in particular, is a concept whose time has come because of the convergence of several factors - namely the sharp increase in home-based businesses, diminished loyalty in ""conventional"" employer/employee relationships, advances in technology, and deregulation of the communications industry.As a former skeptic, I can say that this book goes a long way toward giving the Network Marketing industry the respect that it truly deserves. As an Excel Representative, I can say that like any business, it's not without its warts. But then, we all decide what to make of what we are given, don't we?"
1,"Why is there no ""zero star"" rating for trash like this?","MLM and other Ponzi schemes like Excel will enrich a handful of people (like Excel's Troutt) at the expense of the majority of their participants. They cannot grow indefinitely, despite what their advocates claim about new markets, new products, etc... feeding the pyramid. Read ""Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds"" instead."
5,I OWE ALL OF MY SUCCESS IN EXCEL TO JAMES ROBINSON!,"When I was first approached about the Excel Business Opportunity, I was skeptical about getting involved in a multi-level marketing business. But, then I read THE EXCEL PHENOMENON and knew that this was the business for me! If you are interested in taking advantage of the Excel Business Opportunity, I strongly suggest that you read this fantastic book."

2,Red Hat Linux 7 Unleased review,"This book gives simple, clear answers to the simple questions.However, for more complex Linux code, go elsewhere. I find the chapters Shell Scripting and Automating Tasks give poor examples and the explanations are unclear. For someone new to Linux, this book is a good starting point but for someone looking for a little more technical info than your average Linux manual, this book fails. Two reasons I purchased this book was to learn cron and introduction to shell scripting. Both chapters regarding these topics are hard to read and examples given are futile. For something regarding bash shell scripting, O'Reilly's Learning The Bash Shell by far outweighs the merits of this book, in that particular area, mind you.However the syntax for simpler items regarding Linux is clear and common-sense oriented. But there are so many Linux books covering these fields, it would be nice to see a manual put forth covering detailed code in the manner this book explains simpler terms."
2,Size does NOT matter,"I bought this book because I wanted one of the latest distributions and thought it would be nice to accompany it with a good reference book. This book is well over 1000 pages , and you would think there is plenty of stuff in it right? WRONG. Just browse it a bit carefully (something I didn't do and regretted) and you 'll see they just fill pages over pages with useless listings and screenshots! They list the whole httpd.conf file in 24 pages for example(p.393-416). Sometimes it makes you mad when you realise you spent your money for stuff like ""Now press Enter, and you 'll see:"" and get a couple of pages with listings you could also read from your very screen.My suggestion is : BUY RUNNING LINUX and a separate distribution instead. Those guys have written a real book and not a collection of listings and manual samples like the guys with ""RH 7 Unleashed""!"
2,Too little for a good reference/guide.,"It is often hard to write a book for intermediate users. Covering so many different topics just make it harder. The book gives overviews for many operations that are possible in RedHat. However, too little is provided apart from listing commands and config files, sometime with no explanations. Too many times I have found my self reading HOW-TOS instead - what's the point of having the book?I suggest getting 'Running Linux' (good general) and 'Linux in a nutshell' (good reference) from O'Reilly. This book is too vague for beginners, and of little value to intermediate-advanced users."
2,Too many errors for a beginner,"This book was my first foray into the world of Linux and I found too many errors for this to be a good start for a newbie. Case in point is Chapter 20 on ipchains. The sample firewall script is inclomplete (missing a definition of $ME in the constants section) and contains basic errors (such as showing an option as ""-I"" when it should be ""-i""). Most galling is the publisher's website. There is no section on errata to undo some of the mistakes that made it into print. Moreover, unless your web browser supports vbscript the web site will not load. It requires dissecting the start page source to find a way into the site.Buy the book for the disks, but expect to spend some time extricting yourself from the mistakes in it if you follow all the author's examples."
3,Book is different than sample pages shown,The book I received does not match the sample pages that are displayed.
5,teaching visual literacy,"Degenerate Art is a most valuable curriculum resource in the Advanced Placement Language and Composition classes I teach at a Catholic high school. Part of the AP Comp curriculum is Visual Literacy, and the ability to read Expressionist art is critical in this age of youth entitlement and pointless rebellion. The juxtaposition of Hitler's aesthetic to the ""bones and sinews"" of the Expressionists presents a brilliant opportunity to teach the power of visual rhetoric and the evil of propaganda. In Nazi Germany, life truly imitated art in the case of the tortured physiognomies of the concentration camp victims. That connection haunts me and, hopefully, my students, forever, while Hitler's idealized, saccharine images strike us merely as airbrushed myths."
4,"Superb for relaxing, mellow days which need a little spark","""Sister Sweetly"" is one of those CDs that always seems to fit the mood. With relaxing chords and the occassional harder (though not too hard) riff, listeners can play it at a low volume for cool background music or can crank it up to get into it even more. 'Broken Hearted Savior' is probably the best song on the album - an upbeat song that is the perfect blend of keeping the heart rate slow and leading listeners to sing along under their breath without even realizing it. Some songs are a bit too slow for some - I hear them as appropriate for the most relaxing times (Why ""only"" 4 stars from me? I think it is too easy to throw on a 5-star rating, which should be reserved for only the absolutely best CDs. ""Sister Sweetly"" is still a very, very good album)."
3,really 3 and a half,"I recently bought this album because I remembered liking the single ""Circle"" when it was on the radio around '94. It's a good collection of rootsy pop rock. My main complaint is that it suffers from amatuerish production and overuse of studio effects like flange and delay. However, ""Circle"" and ""Brother John"" are great songs and make the album worth it by themselves."
4,A great CD!!,"This CD is a great investment. I think that this is the perfect CD to listen to when you just feel like relaxing. ""It's Alright"" is probably my favorite song on the CD. I definately recommend this CD to everyone."
5,"Truly a ""desert-island"" cd","Anybody who appreciates great songwriting should have this cd. We never take a car trip without it; like ""Dark Side of the Moon,"" for example, it fits all moods and is playable every day. BHTM classics like the poignant ""Broken Hearted Savior,"" the sad-but-amusing ""Turn the Light Out,"" ""Soul for Every Cowboy,"" the lyrics to which are reverently quoted on every Todd Tribute website; the reassuring ""It's Alright,"" the more produced version of Midnight Radio's ""Bittersweet,"" and crowd-singalong favorites ""Circle"" and ""Brother John"" make this one of the best albums in existence. BHTM should be millionaires by virtue of this album alone, not to mention their impressive body of work as a whole."
2,"A few good songs, but inconsistent in sound","I bought this CD back when it was released because I really liked the song ""Bittersweet,"" which I still think is a terrific song. Unfortunately, that was the only song I really liked, even after repeated listenings. I think that the problem for me is that there is not a consistent sound to this CD. Some of it sounds like Hootie and the Blowfish and some of it sounds closer to Phish. I think that people who really appreciate early 90's alt rock might like this CD, others may want to pass on it."
5,big head todd and the monsters ROCK!!!!!,This has got to be the best cd i haveever purchased. I love the bluezy yetrock way that it is done. i havent heard the cd in a couple of year because i had lost it and i have justpurchased it again and im having a hardtime taking it off the cd player. i cant stop singing it in my head. i love it!!!!!
5,waste,i learned to appreciate life other than that not worth the money really just dont drink and drive is all i learned
4,I love MY First LeapPad,"First I'll start by saying I really think My First LeapPad is a great educational and fun toy for 3-4 year olds. I highly recommend it. As for this particular book/cartridge...we have about 6-8 books and this is probably the one I see my kids play the least. We are Dr Seuss fans and have the storybook version of this but there are definately more interesting games that capture and hold children's attention with greater educational value such as any of the books with the Leapfrog characters like Tad's Silly Number Farm, I know my ABC's, and Tad's Silly Writing Fair."
4,Can't go wrong w/Seuss,This is for my grand daughter. I haven't asked her what she thinks of it. Her vocabulary is limited but maybe Dr. Seuss will encourage growth.
5,Reliable classic,"This is your basic classic Blue Italian Spode. The same stuff your mother, your grandmother, your great-grandmother etc collected and used on special occasions. The only difference is that it has been updated to be dishwasher and microwave safe. I don't know if the old stuff was also dishwasher and microwave safe and they just added the new stamp, or if they did something to its composition. But it works well. Just be sure to not use a real strong detergent. I did and saw some fading (on lots of other stuff too-that stuff took designs off glasses and other plates). Since switching to a ""regular"" detergent I have had no problems."
3,Made in Malaysia,"Despite Amazon's claims that Spode is made in England, the set I received was made in Malaysia. I was very upset by this and almost sent it back, but do like the china and decided to keep it. My Tableware explained that as of late 2007, all Spode china is made in Malaysia or India (I have not verified this). I have no idea how this might compare to the Spode that was made in England. Other reviewers claim that the quality isn't as high, that things are printed off-center, etc. I don't see that with my set, but it's possible that I'm missing something.I'm only giving this 3 stars because the china is not made in England as advertised. I'm happy with the set, but if you're looking for something with a ""Made in England"" stamp, you probably want to keep looking.My Tableware packaged everything well, and offered very good customer service."
4,"Scary, erotic, to the point","Ozon doesn't mess around with REGARDE LA MER. There simply aren't any extraneous details...everything works together to produce a big ole feeling of dread, the likes of which I haven't experienced in too many other movies. The mother's carelessness and the drifter's sickness are trains rushing at each other on the same track; we only wonder how and when they're going to crash. Beautifully filmed and capably acted, Regarde La Mer is more than just a psychological thriller. It's a work of art.(By the way, the title is a play on words, because the French word mere (mother) sounds like mer (sea). And the title ""Look at the Mother"" tells you more about the movie than does ""See the Sea."")"
4,Severe contrasts,"See the Sea is an eerie portrayal of a sadistic wanderer that will really give you the creeps. Ozon is very talented and has a very unique technique that he uses to portray some fairly erotic scenes. The movie was well done but a little bit too morbid and disgusting for me. It is a severe contrast to the short film that proceeds it which is the reason I bought the film. The short, A Summer Dress, is light and funny and at the same time erotic and sexy. The short film is a coming of age story of sorts that explores the bi-sexuality of the main character. The attractiveness of the characters is both physical and by personality. Very sexy and the theme song will stay in your mind forever! Bang!Bang!"
5,"Sasha hails Outstanding , Ozon is the new Hitchcock","This is truly a gripping short story , shot on a beautiful French Island. Sasha Hails is one of the true outstanding actresses of our time and Ozon will deliver more over the years to come. If this is any example of their partner ship, sit back and wait for more it will be worth it.What was of interest was the Baby in the movie was in fact hails trule life daughter Samantha.This movie won an award in the US Gay film festival, not that the movie has overly a gay theme but rather the Gay communities ability to spot a true winner and honour it accordingly."
2,"Not fun, but that's the point","This is a very disturbing movie. The pace is excellent for 50 minutes long; however, I did not like the storyline. The actors are excellent and characters are well developed for the short length of the movie. The mother and daughter bond felt sincere (later found out that they are really related).The reason I did not like this movie is solely because of the storyline, it is too trite, I simply felt I've seen this type of suspenseful movie before. The movie did impart some much needed wisdom: I will never leave my toothbrush in the bathroom while guests are present."
3,Not Milly's best,"Although Pienso Asi won a Grammy, in my opinion it it the least successful of Milly's solo albums. Most of the songs are just not that distinctive, and the arrangments, striving to be ""different"" just don't work for me.There are two notable exceptions: The opening ""Me Duele el Alma"" is all one would expect from the opening of a Milly Quezada album, and the rare salsa, Sonar Despierta, is a knock out."
3,"""Zero At The Bone"" Moved Too Slow!","I admit, I might be getting too critical when it comes to mystery novels lately. But I have read so many that I start to know what a really good mystery novel is and which ones are not. ""Zero At The Bone"" was the first novel that I have read by Mrs. Walker. Don't get me wrong, the book wasn't bad at all, but the plot moved quite slowly and there was not much suspense. Most of the novel described in great detail the tasks and obligations that a zookeeper must go through. How to clean the cage, sweep the floor, feed the animals, take the snake out of his cage, and on and on. If you work at a zoo, you'll love this book I guarantee it! Although, the characters were well developed and likeable, I wouldn't put this book on my ""must read list"" at all. Not bad Mrs. Walker!Brad Stonecipher"
3,A Good Mystery But Not Her Best,"Walker's Zero At The Bone is a satisfying mystery that is worth reading. However, Zero At The Bone is nowhere near as good as Walker's The Red Scream and Under The Beetle's Cellar--both of which are VERY good,particularly the latter."
2,This book is from an award-winnning writer?!,"This was a most dissapointing book. Ms. Willis Walker has managed to do the impposible, which was to take an interesting heroine like Katherine Driscoll, surround her with promising, yet underutilized characters, and a lousy story that is no better that a Susan Lucci TV Movie of the Week on the Lifetime Channel. Pick up this snoozer at the library!"
4,4kittens,"I bought this used, thinking it was first in a series by this author. Even though it wasn't part of a series, and since I haven't read anything by this author before, I loaned it to a friend. She said it was okay. I read it and enjoyed it, it was hard to put down. I have loaned it to another friend, to see if she likes it."
4,Scan Converter Functionality,"The zoom has only one setting...too big or too small, this can be overcome by the computer's second display resolution setting. Since I use the device to capture the Pastors PowerPoint presentation I don't want to mess with his settings. My capture software (AVS/Total Media) both draw an image at 720X480 with substantial black border video data around the desired image. The result is low in luminance and there is slight video noise even when using s-video. The solution that I use is TMPGEnc 4.0 Xpress program to crop the black border, resize, raise luminance and de-noise. I am sure there is professional equipment out there costing a lot more, for the price this does a good job."
5,A great book revealing a part of American social reality.,Males is a trenchant statistical arguer. He overlays graphs and makes other unexpected comparisons to break many stigmatic myths about American youth. A real eye-opener!
1,Horrible,"The book is nothing but a barrage of statistics. Some of which are interesting, but most are not. There is no argument unless you naively put all of your faith in the way the data is presented."
2,not what you said it was,"You sold me another product under false pretences so even if it is similar, this is unacceptable. And it is not the same, it does not dissolve like Amosan, so...false product. The product you sold me is available at Shoppers for 1/2 the price. How happy do you think I am?? I am considering to stop buying even books from you because of this unethical procedure. Would not recommend to anybody to shop other than books"
2,I received another product,"I received completely another product which is not manufactured by Oral-B at all. The brand is life, and it is made in Canada. I am not sure if it is a FDA approved product."
2,Shipping was way too much!!,The product is great but the cost to have it shipped to me was over $8.00 which was over the top!!! I won't order from this company again!!!
5,So disappointed,"I'm shocked that not only has this product has been DC'd, but that the sellers on Amazon, who still have a limited supply, have jacked the price up tremendously. I paid $6.00 (for a 20-pack) in the drugstore the last time I purchased it. Now, the sellers are asking anywhere from $35 to $50 for a 20-pack. GOUGING at its worst. Very disappointed."
4,Excellent book for children!,"I grew up reading this book to my grandfather and it is an easy book for children to read. It gives a wonderful depiction of the special relationship grandfathers have with their grandchildren. Even though I am grown up now, I still read this book to my grandfather when I visit him. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did."
2,A Bit Disappointed,"I was a bit disappointed with Grandfather and I. I had expected a book that would showcase the love of a Grandpa for his grandchild. While Grandfather and I does that, it does so at the expense of love from parents, siblings, and friends. Grandparents are special relatives. I thank the Lord for His mercy in giving my children wonderful grandparents to love them, but a grandparent's love is not better than a parent's love -- only different."
5,Pain and Pretending an Excellent resource,This book is a very readable and gives understandable examples of the pain and consequences of abuse. It also gives hope and information on the healing process.
2,Not worth your time,"I bought this set as a cheap way of cleaning out the bottom of dadoes. Well the cheap price is for good reason. The soles are not flat, the blade openings are not square, and the blades themselves are some sort of inferior steel resulting in an edge that will not hold. They look nice, but are really impractical. Don't bother"
1,Junk,I got this book 2 years ago. Bobby Fischer doesn't teach chess in this book. What a complete waste of space and the trees that were killed to make the paper for this book should start a revolution!I didn't read any reviews on this book before asking my parents to order it. That was a mistake since people seem to becoming wise and wanting books that teach instead of simple problem books that don't tell you the way and how in actual words. If you are simple minded and cannot understand to read words then this book may be for you. If you want to be taught then buy another book. Logical Chess Move by Move or Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors are much better books that have a real teachere behind them.
2,Title is misleading,This is a Puzzle Book with very simple checkmates to solve. This book is not set up up to give real instruction as there is are no real lessons in this book. (...). That book gives you a lot more puzzles for the money.
1,You have got to be kidding!,Is this book REALLY written by the Great Bobby Fisher was my first question after i saw this book for 5 minutes. The problems are so simple that my 6 year old sister can solve them (I am not kidding she actually looked at the first 4 positions in the book and found the checkmate in 3 of 4 of them right away).This is not a serious book to learn from. Don't get it.
2,Not very good,Hi! I have been playing chess for 6 months and got this book. I got about 6 books on chess. This book was less useful because it only has bobby fisher teaching checkmates. I am usually so far ahead in the game when I win against other kids that knowing the fancy checkmates doesn't do me any good because I would win anyway. I don't think that this book helped me too much.
2,Not the best checkmate problem book,"This book covers very basic checkmate problems to solve and is ok, for a beginner to use along with additional books.The problem is not that this book is so bad, but that there are much better books available for beginners. My favorite is the Chess For Juniors Book that has real instruction. For books on checkmate problems I like 1001 Brilliant Checkmates by Reinfeld."
1,Oversized Diagrams - Fischer Teaches very little,The book uses a lot of space to cover very little stuff. Get 1001 Brilliant Checkmates by Reinfeld. The book's title makes it seem like you get good quality lessons when it is just a simple problem book.
3,Decent condition,"The book arrived in a timely manner but it was written in. Normally it doesn't bother me if a book has an inscription or some hand-written notes scrawled inside, but because this was a workbook I was pretty disappointed to find that it had already been completed by someone else."
3,Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess,Priceless information. Had to have this book as soon as I saw it. Great for kids just getting into chess as well as a seasoned veteran.
4,Great for beginners - but only beginners,"When my eleven year old daughter wanted to learn chess, I bought this book for her. The vocabulary is simple and the concepts are easy to grasp without having to set up a board or work through long examples. She can read a few pages, put the book down and come back to it later without having to backtrack. It is perfect for where she is now.The book's simplicity is its greatest attribute and also its greatest shortcoming. You cannot learn deep, complicated theory by reading a book a few minutes at a time. Consequently, you will not learn deep, complicated theory from this book.It's a great place to start; but it's only a start."
2,2 stars to Mate in 2. For you.,"This book is really just a collection of mate in 2 puzzles. The authors seem to think that learning how to recognise mate in 2 will help you play better. That is crazy, tactics, opening theory, Endgame theory, study in these areas and your game will improve. Practice seeing deeper, play slower. This book developes none of these skills. Some of the mates were sparkling so I did give it 2 stars"
2,Compared to what is available this is not a very good book,"This is a book for the absolute beginner who has not learned any strategy yet. This book covers one thing only, ""simple checkmates"".An entire simple checkmate takes up an entire page. The book also avoids any use of chess notation that is important to go on to learn from more advanced books that are needed to progress. It is not as much as this book is so bad. It is that there are books that cover checkmates, tactics and traps that are so much better now available. Tactics and traps are also important for the beginner to know, not just checkmates. If you really want a book just on checkmates alone then look at ""Art of Checkmate"" or ""How to Beat your Dad at Chess"". They are examples of two much better books."
1,Title is misleading!,"This book has the title that made me think there was covering of all points of chess. But when I got the book Bobby Fischer only sets up positions (and only one per page) where you must find a checkmate that is very, very easy to find. Every page is like this. I should have read the reviews on it so I could have spent the money on a top book that teaches beginners. If you are are reading this (like I should have read the reviews) then do not buy this book unless you want a bunch of easy to solve checkmate positions instead of a book that has real lessons to learn from. I have since gotten ""Chess for Juniors"" and ""How to Beat your Dad at Chess"". ""Chess for Juniors"" gives very good lessons and ""How to Beat your Dad"" has checkmate positions but tells you much more about them."
1,To the Point!,"I will be to the point! This book as written for a near absolute beginner using the name ""Bobby Fischer"" on the title when he wasn't the actual author.A player just beyond learning the moves doesn't need a book of ""just checkmate"" positions to solve - another problem with this title ""teach's chess"" - teaching chess doesn't jut entail showing someone ""how to checkmate - but more importantantly how to use concepts to get to the position where an easy checkmate is executed.If you are at a beginning or advanced beginning level totally skip this book and get CHESS FOR JUNIORS - you will see what I mean!"
4,Make moves like Chess,This is an excellent book for anyone interested in learning how to play chess or anyone who already knows the game. I've checked out various Chess tudor books but Bobby Fisher's simple guides/explanations makes this a book that stands out in my opinion. It hasn't made me a Grand Master yet-but it has definitely pushed me closer to understanding the game much more.
4,Basic Chess Book,"If you're new to Chess and what to see some simple ways to win the end game then this book has a lot of quizzes to offer. It's not for intermediate players, only beginners. An intermediate play could work through this book in a couple of hours and it would be a waste of their time. But for a beginner it will show what you need to be thinking about and what to look out for when protecting against simple mate combos. Bobby Fischer lends nothing to this other then his name on the cover."
3,Book on Checkmates,I don't like that book does not teach students to use chess notation and that it takes an entire page for just one checkmate position.It does not compare to my favorite book HOW TO BEAT YOUR DAD AT CHESS. Look at this one first.
3,Big book of back rank mate,"This book isn't worthless--in fact, it's a pretty good exercise for a beginning player. The format is involving and fun. However, if you buy it, you should be aware that it is extremely limited. It deals only with mating combinations, first of all, and within mating combinations mostly with back-rank mate. Although this is useful to know about, it hardly represents the totality what is needed to play chess. If you are looking for mating combinations, go ahead and buy it. If you are looking for a book to introduce you to chess, their are lots of other books that fit this purpose. I recommend I. A. Horowitz's Chess for beginners as one good book for a beginner."
2,Too Basic,"I found ""Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess"" to be too basic and the problems set up to be very easy to solve. So easy it was a waiste of money."
2,Checkmate your opponent!,If you would like to be able to finish your opponent off in brilliant style with a fantsy check mate then this book will teach you backrank and other checkmates to win.I didn't like it very much because it didn't teach me anything else like forks and pins which are the things you need to know to get to a position where you can do the checkmate. This is my disapointment.
5,Stresses the important stuff,"This is programed instruction book. You don't need a chessboard or even more than the most superficial knowledge of chess to read it. It starts with this is a chess board and these are the pieces to its major emphasis which is how to check mate your opponent. Since that is the object of chess, his focus is right on. The good news is that he makes you think. The bad news is that he makes you think. But unless you are at the master level, reading this book should improve your game. Perhaps even there! After all, look who wrote it."
1,Not recommeded for any level,"I felt that it would be worthwhile to warn chess players of any level before they consider getting this piece of trash. Looking at the other recent reviews they point things out well, i.e. One entire very easy to find checkmate problem takes up an entire page not using real chess notation. The Title implies it is a teaching book but it has no lesson plan and covers an extremely narrow scope of material.Here is what I do recommend (as pointed out by some others): THE ART OF THE CHECKMATE (the best book on checkmates avaialable)."
4,Should be one volume of a 20-volume set!,"This book is great, and the teaching method it uses is excellent (and a lot of fun), but the book would have been more properly titled ""Bobby Fischer Teaches How To Find The Back-Rank Forced Mate After Your Opponent Has Already Walked Into It."" Other situations you will encounter in chess besides these are not covered in this book. So, four stars instead of five."
4,Basics of Chess,"If you have ever taught chess, one of the questions I am asked is, ""What book do you recommend for a rank beginner?"" Or, ""I just learned how to play chess a very short time ago. I have not read any chess books yet. What book should I read first?"" This is the book!"
2,Not Challenging for Me,"I didnot get much out of BOBBY FISCHER TEACHES CHESS. I am an advanced beginner and the problems were too easy, even for a kid! I found HOW TO BEAT YOUR DAD AT CHESS to be a lot better, more challenging and it is set up to teach you more."
1,Yuk!,"Why I donot like this book:It only sets up diagrams with positions of problems to solve with solutions given in moves themselves.Bobby Fischer, who I undersatnd is the greatest chess player of all time is not also the greatest chess teacher of all time - understand the differense?There are not explanations of anything - just diagrams with problems to solve and then moves as the solutions. A book should tell in words, not just moves about learning."
2,A Book for Beginner,"The quality of the product and the delivery are very good.Though it was very disappointing to learn that this book is for those who do not know how to play chess. Even in this case it is not helpful at all.It would be nice to add some information about the contents of the book, rather than to put all the emphasize on the name of its author.Total disappointment."
2,"A little good, mostly bad","This is a puzzle book, which the advertizing doesn't tell you when you go to buy it. The puzzles are checkmates and it is also important to learn to win pieces to because this is what usually happens first. I didn't learn much from this book because the easy checkmate problems are very obvious.Arrows show you where the pieces move. This might be good for a person who doesn't want to learn to read chess notation. But, it makes you lazy if you should be learning to read chess moves."
4,Chess,"It explains the ways to get out of checkmate, how to checkmate the opponent, but not so much the strategy in how to create the situations he is explaining. I guess he leaves that up to us to work on, but I was hoping for a more in depth detail. For what it does explain, it is a very good book."
3,Teaches basics and... a little more,"This book may appeal to someone who just started playing chess. Some of the diagrams that illustrate problems or actual famous chess contests are interesting, but do not go into detail as to the mindset behind some of these moves. It would have been nice to include 2 or 3 famous contests, move by move, now and then explaining the reasoning behind the strategy behind the moves."
3,Basic Checkmates in easy to use format,"If you are looking for a book with well-rounded instruction on chess then you are looking at the wrong book. However, if you are a beginner and want an inexpensive book that provides you with some good basic checkmates then consider BOBBY FISCHER TEACHES CHESS along with HOW TO BEAT YOUR DAD AT CHESS."
4,A decent supplement for beginners,"The book never mentions for what level this book is intended for but only beginners and novices will benefit from this book. If you know your chess rating and it's less than 1300 (Beginners start at 1000), this is a good quiz book that gives you puzzles that are solvable; making a reader think as far as 4 moves ahead.However, while it's decent at making the user determine what next move would lead to checkmate that's all it covers; with the exception of a scant few pages that discusses how each piece moves and common chess terminology.The first book a beginner should get should provide a comprehensive review of chess from the opening, the middle game, and the endgame; maybe it'll even include several opening moves and defences that a novice can learn from and build his repertoire from."
4,Tactics For Beginners,"This is an extremely easy to read book. I recommend it for anyone rated below 1400. It's just a puzzle book with easy to solve positions that show you the basic checkmates.Why is this chess puzzle book any better than others? First it is easy to read. Many books have hard to read annotation, small blurry diagrams, and confusing symbols. This book gives you one puzzle on each page and keeps it as simple as possible. It is also void of errors. This small pocket sized book won't take you long to finish. It will build your confidence and reinforce the basic mates.If this book is too easy for you then it's time to buy Fred Reinfeld's 1001 Brilliant Ways to Checkmate."
2,Know what you are getting,"This book teaches some basic Chess tactics - and does it rather well. It will NOT improve your knowledge of openings, strategy, or endings. If you want to become an expert on back-rank mates, this is the book for you. If you want to know why Fischer is considered one of the greatest players of all time, read his ""60 Memorable Games"". If you are a beginner, this book is totally inadequate preparation for his magnum opus."
2,Find the checkmate should be the title,"BOBBY FISCHER TEACHES CHESS in not a book with lessons that teach you like the title makes you think. If you are want a book on one limited tactic: ""Checkmates"" and only checkmates (not the pin, not the fork, not the discovered attack or even the x-ray attack or overworked piece) then this book is just ok (I have seen better checkmate books - suggested by some of the other reviewers). I suggest if you are a beginner and want to learn the basics or material just beyond that then get either CHESS FOR JUNIORS by Robert Snyder with twenty great lessons or LEARN CHESS by Alexander and Beach."
3,It's a great book for beginners,"If you've never played chess before, why not learn from one of the best players in the world? This book is layed out logically, progressively building on previous material. It will leave a complete newcomer with a basic understanding of the rules of the game, and some basic mating patterns. Anyone who is more than a rank beginner will be extremely bored with this book, and probably somewhat upset about spending their money on it."
4,An Ideal Way to Begin Learning Chess,"As others have noted, a better title for this book would be ""Bobby Fischer Teaches Checkmate"", since that is as far as it goes. On the other hand, what better way is there to introduce the game? A complete beginner, ignorant even of the pieces and their moves, can pick up this book and very quickly proceed to an understanding of combinations that have ended grandmaster games. If a youngster can be thrilled by chess, this is the book to do it, and they will be eager to learn the rest of the game from other sources."
2,Know what you are getting,"This book teaches some basic Chess tactics - and does it rather well. It will NOT improve your knowledge of openings, strategy, or endings. If you want to become an expert on back-rank mates, this is the book for you. If you want to know why Fischer is considered one of the greatest players of all times, read his ""60 Memorable Games"". If you are a beginner, this book is totally inadequate preparation for his magnum opus."
1,Can I give this a zero?,"Ah, oh my gosh! I ordered this THING ONLINE! Then got it read through the first part of it - then almost cried. Wish I read the reviews before (yes somewhat mixed, but would have picked up on the reviews by those who never read a real chess book).I just finished reading my ""Chess For Juniors"", which is awesome!! Then thought I was ready for BOBBY FISCHER!!! The only drawback to my ""Chess For Juniors"" book is it didn't warn me about the Fischer Book (joking here obviously!).The Fischer book shows Fischer isn't a chess teacher - just is (now perhaps was) a great player. It is a simple series of problems and answers without explaining ideas.Don't spend your money on this!"
3,Non-Fiction,"A pretty standard chess instruction manual, definitely not one of the better books on the subject that I found when I was interested.A definite take it or leave it, unless you were a huge Fischer nut or somesuch.Look elsewhere.2.5 out of 5"
3,A decent endgame book,"Don't expect this book to make you play like Fischer. I'm not saying that it is a bad book...I am just saying that Bobby doesn't actually teach the game of chess in this book. Rather he teaches only specific moves of the endgame, namely checkmates. It is a fine book for learning and/or practicing your mating moves. I enjoyed the simple format in which there is a problem on each page that asks the reader to just draw a line on the chessboard or check off yes and no answers. It's not necessary to write out any algebraic notations in this book. However, if you are looking for a good book to grasp the game of chess as a whole, this is not the right book for you. Instead, I would recommend The Complete Idiot's Guide to Chess and Irving Chernev's Logical Chess Move by Move. Nevertheless, this book is suitable to add to your chess library, just don't make it your only resource."
2,Strictly Beginners,"I would consider myself somewhat beyond beginner. I can defeat most people who play casual chess, but I have little success against any real students of the game.The first half of the book was fairly uninteresting to me as it restated what I considered obvious. The second half moved into slightly more complex situations, but nothing that made me say, ""That's a good idea!""Also, there is very little explanation for any situation. In essence, this is a puzzle book where the solution is given in one line.If you're a weak casual player, this may be of some benefit. Otherwise, I would look elsewhere."
1,NOT written by Bobby Fischer,"I got this book a couple of years ago and didn't like it it much because I felt it was a cheap imitation of 1001 Brilliant Checmates by Reinfeld (a much, much better book if you want checkmates to work on).Then it came out in the news! Bobby Fischer didn't write this book, he was approached by somebody else who wrote it and then agreed to put his name on it. This is because Bobby Fischer who is now in prison in Japan has been in the news again. Finally the searching for bobby Fishcer is now over and this book was found to never be writen by him.Now it is bad because it is misleading to think the book is teaching you by bobby fisher and that it only has easy to find checkmates in it. Chess is much more complicated than only knowing how to find an easy to find checkmate at the end of a game!"
5,Graphic chess tutorial,"This is a very good book on chess by Bobby Fisher. I purchased it initially in the 1970's when it first came out. This was a new copy I gave to my grandsons. The entire book shows you chess board layots on one page and asks a question or gives you information. The following page gives you the answer or demenstrates the point being made on another chess board. It is easy to follow, I read it all over again. My grandsons are using it and picking up some good pointers.I even set up some of the chess game layouts on my computer."
4,Decent start for a beginning or intermediate player,"This is a very good book for beginners but I wouldn't make it your only book, you should also get Chess for Dummies or something similar. This book will present you with many puzzles and some explanation that will improve your ability to see the board and the moves on it, but it is not complete by itself, you'll need another book that will help you bone up on the ideas behind positions and help you to think through tactics and strategy in a more abstract way. Get this book and Chess for Dummies or The Mammoth Book of Chess for a great 1-2 punch for starting to play seriously."
1,Only for Absolute Beginners,This books is only for absolute beginners. I picked it up just after learning the moves. It's useful in helping to see some very simple back row mates delivered by either the Queen or Rook. But that's it. That's pretty much what the whole book is about. This was probably the least useful chess book I've ever read.
5,"Great Format, easy to learn from!!!!","This is a great book for begining to intermediate players to learn and improve. You don't need a chess board to follow along, which makes this a great book for using anywhere. I go through this book again about every 3 months just to refresh. My only complant is that Fischer didn't write more books on advanced topics using this teaching method [hint, hint : )]. I reccomend this book to everyone I know who wants to improve both the chess play and chess understanding. Fischer cleverly teachs checkmate patterns, basic tactics and combinations and even some postitional aspects of the game without you even realizing it. I can't say enough great things about this book. It should be noted this book is even recommended by the USCF in their 'beginer's value pack'. Good luck!"
2,Did not teach me much,I thought this book was going to provide instruction using lesson plans.It is nothing but a bunch of easy to solve checkmating problems and doesn't cover other important types of tactics which are important to know.This book is only good if you are a beginner who does know the most easy checkmates.
3,Not the worst tactics book,"This is not the worst tactics books as some of the reviews have said. But it is lacking in many ways. It only covers basic checkmate positions and not the other parts of the game, which is also important to learn. All the problems in the book work - no mistakes that I could find at all! Kinda fun."
2,Bobby Fisher doesn't teach like he plays the game,I was once told that a good player in a sport doesnot alway make the best teacher. This is the case here. Why does this book have such a high position? Only because Bobby Fisher has his name on it and he must be making big bucks in Japan if that is where they are mailing the checks.I do not have a Jen (no pun intended) for this book because of the following things ----it doesn't explain things just gives you positions with answers.it only concetrated on finishing the game (checkmates) and doesn't show you how you got there.Why do I not give it one star instead of two. Because there are some nice checkmates. But this is not a good reason to write a book if you were a world champion and don't show everthing involved.
2,Much better books with tactics available,"This book I am sure sells because of the name of Bobby Fischer on it. But in reality it is a poorly written book on simple checkmate tactics. Not much material.If you are thinking of getting a good book, for beginners I recommend the Chess For Juniors book. If you are just beyond then beginning stage then maybe Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors by Hays, or even much better yet the new book called WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS (this book is great!) should make this Bobby Fischer doesn't really teach chess book look bad."
1,Fischer Couldn't Have Written This,"Bobby Fischer has been considered by many as the greatest chess player of all time.If he wrote this book, for real, he is certainly not a good writer or teacher. This book DOESN'T TEACH CHESS.Each page is a very simple chess problem to work on - yes, an entire page with overgrown diagram (I am a kid - but don't need the baby stuff). There is no explanation of ideas - just solutions given to you in moves.If you want a book to teach the basics get CHESS FOR JUNIORS. I loved that one and it gives you real lessons."
2,Does not compare to my other Fischer Book,I have a copy of MY 60 MEMORABLE GAMES by Bobby Fischer. This is a most cool book with good analysis and I then saw BOBBY FISCHER TEACHES CHESS. Two completely different books in quality.In BOBBY FISCHER TEACHES CHESS he does not explain things - simple position - find the checkmate - boom! simple moves as a solution. There are other books that do this without wasting so much space and you get a lot more positions.Now to compare: HOW TO BEAT YOUR DAD AT CHESS and SIMPLE CHECKMATES gives you a lot more material.
1,The most horrible checkmate book,"This book is absolutely horrible. One problem to work on per page, too simple, not well organized by type of checkmate pattern. It taught me nothing.Get HOW TO BEAT YOUR DAD AT CHESS intead!"
1,Book Only for Beginner Chess - Nothing from Fischer Himself,"Among Chess books, there are many that provide in depth analysis that will elevate players at any level. Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess is not that book as it is specifically geared only to the beginning level player.If you are brand new to chess and would like to learn the basics from one of the greatest players of all time, this book is for you. However, for those thinking this will provide a glimpse into the intriguing mind of Bobby Fischer, you will be sorely disappointed as this book goes no further than simple multi-move mating attacks with no content regarding strategy, tactics, or positional play.I rate this book poorly because the title is vague and misleading. Anyone in the chess world would expect a lesson from Bobby Fischer to be captivating in the least. This book would better be served by the name ""Someone Other than Bobby Fischer Explains Very Basic Chess for Beginners""."
4,Excellent for beginners (only),great book! wish i had this book in my early days of chess. a must for all beginners.
2,disappointed,The book was pretty elementary on his teaching techniques. The philosophies he writes about would be of use to a new player of chess. But for advanced play the book simply doesn't offer much.
2,No Charactor,"A book of simple, easy to find checkmates. How to Beat Your Dad at Chess was better. The book called ""Simple Checkmates"" even better yet.Bobby Fischer only teaches simple checkmates. A checkmate is usually the end result of other tactics and ideas which this book doesn't cover.I like Logical Chess, Move by Move, Chess For Juniors, and Unbeatable Chess Lessons For Juniors for beginners or advanced beginners."
2,Not good instruction,My parents bought this book for me. It doesn't have lessons and it doesn't explain anything - just problems with checkmates. I could have given it away to one of my friends but felt that it would have just bored them and not made chess interesting.
5,Much better condidtion than advertised,"The seller said it was in fair condition, but it was actually in great condition for such an old book. It arrived quickly and the price was also great. Thanks so much!"
2,A waist of money,"If I had seen this book before ordering it I would have never bought it. It is a simple workbook of checkmate problems that didn't require someone of Bobby Fischer's ability to ""compile"". No real sill or teaching ability was required to ""compile"" these problems to work on."
1,Little to learn from,"Although it's truly a book for people at beginners' level, I would NOT recommend this book to begineers. It does teach ""how to play chess"" in the first few pages since it covers how to move different pieces and how to capture; but it doesn't tell how to open a game, how to formulate a plan and etc. You may use the book at a mate-in-one training book, however, there are tons of others to choose from for that matter."
5,"I love this book,third time I've gotten it in my life time...",I have had this book two other times in my life. When I lose it I miss having it so I was glad to track one down.Its a great book from a great player..
5,Excelent book for beginners,"There is a small paperback version of this book, but the printing is bad and the diagrams are too small, so I decided to buy an used hardcover edition. I read it with my 9-year old daughter.The book is very interactive and teaches using questions and problems. In some cases, it takes examples from real Bobby Fischer games. The book focus on check and end of the game situations. It has very few openning and middle game examples.It is not a complete book, but the way it is structured is really intersting. I surely recommend it for beginners at the ""only-know-how-to-move-the-pieces"" level."
2,What Happened?,"I read this book many years ago -- I would guess it was 1975. I knew nothing about chess and needed to learn quick - a friend of mine was beating me senseless day after day - it was a long summer off from school and he enjoyed chess (who wouldn't with a victim like me!)This book quickly turned me into a better player than my friend, who never beat me again. So - when recently I ordered a copy of this book for a friend of my daughter's who wanted to improve her game, I was disappointed to find that this re-printed edition is of very poor quality. It is almost impossible to make out the position of the pieces in the many diagrams in the book, and this is a fatal flaw for such a book."
4,Somewhat simple book.,"This is a straightforward book on the basic rudiments of chess combinations, for the most part. While it is fairly easy to understand, I found most of its combination exercises rather simple. From this point on, I think the student of chess has to go on to a book with more complex combinations, such as Leslie Ault's The Chess Tutor: Elements of Combinations. That is a nasty book. Finish that one and you should see your game improve. Back to the Fischer book, I would recommend it as the first book you should review to start getting better at combinations."
2,Best Title Should Be: SIMPLE CHECKMATES,"The title of this book should be SIMPLE CHECKMATES, not Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess because that is what this book is all about. So before you would purchase this book don't be fooled by the title because the only thing you learn are simple checkmates. [...]I do like this book if I want to do checkmates, but because that is all it covers and the title makes it sound like it might cover all the parts of the game I give it a low ranking."
1,Don't be fooled,"I have been told by a reliable source that this book was ""Ghost written"" and Fischer took no more than a glance at it before accepting payment.The book contains simple checkmate problems, using an entire page for each one. Poor use of space.It is written for students at the beginning level. However, why not get a book with a lot more content? Such as ""Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors"", ""Chess For Juniors"", ""Pandolfini's Chess Traps and Zaps"" if you are a beginner?This book obviously sells for one reason, Fischer's name is on it. Stay away from this book."
2,Confusing & Useless Book,"Please,Please,Please If You Love Your Hard Earned Money & Precious Time Dont Buy This Book(Even For Free).This Book Will Leave You Confused Wheather To Beleive In Things Described in The Book Or Not.Case Studies Are Good But Whats The Use ?If You Cant Make Your Mind on Anything.Better Try Some Other Authors."
4,Works well,"My parrot, Indy, will it eat it mostly, but only after he has finished his preferred foods (pasta and nutriberries). He does have to be somewhat hungry to eat this - certainly not as ""delicious"" to him as I thought it might be."
5,im watching the movie now!,"i am watching the movie right now as i type this (in at the part where Anikka wakes up after she is frozen) I was thinking that i wanted the anikka doll (aww, the little girls are delayin the sunrise!) anyway, then i thought that i wanted the brietta doll, and they do sell her! i cant wait to get this for christmas!"
2,Barbie as the Magic of Pegasus Brietta Doll,"VALIO the PAIN the DELAY BY THIS WRIST, to MY HAJA HIM ENCHANTMENT, I PEDI BEND WITH THIS WRIST BUT ME THEY SENT IT SEPARATED and I DO NOT LIKE DIFFERENT LOADS."
5,Beer stain Bear Family,"Love these books. My kids love them. When I walked into the toy room and found it a disaster just after cleaning it, I knew it was time for something. My 3 year old really relates to books and this series. I think we need to read it a few more times but she really enjoyed the story and tries helping more."
3,its ok,"I personaly don't like the berenstain bears, but if you like the berenstain bears you will like this book the messy room."
4,messy room,I put this on my kindle fire. my granddaughters ages 3 and 5 both enjoy it very much. When I first looked at it I didn't think it would be that great but the girls really love it.
4,good lesson,"My 3 year old son loves it when I read him this book. I'm not sure if he understands the whole lesson behind the story, but maybe someday I hope he does."
4,Reasonably useful,"My 5 yo daughter loves these books and has since she first met them when she was 3. The books give an opportunity to discuss relevent issues in a child's life, but they don't always motivate my children to act on the particular solution presented by the bear family, which is fine. Sometimes all we have to do is start a discussion and eventually it will lead somewhere. :-)"
5,The berenstain Bears and the messy room,The Berenstain Bears and the Messy room by Stan berenstain is an exciting and hilarious book. My favorite part of this book is when brother bear fell down with the mess in his room. This book is an exciting and hilarious book. Ihope you read this book.
2,Messy Room,"The Berenstain Bears and the Messy Room is about Bother and Sister Bear who never clean their room. One day, Momma bear had enough and made the cubs change their way. After talking, they decide to do something about it. This book teaches children about responsibility. This book is good for children from 4-11. I thought it was a pretty good book."
2,completely unsuitable,"As usual the lesson is right on target, but decapitating sister as an example to the family sends entirely the wrong message to children."
5,Have great respect for John Ashcroft,"""On My Honor"" is really about the values and the wisdom that was imparted to John Ashcroft through his earthly father's love and affection and teaching through how he lived and shared his life with his family and with others. I have been inspired through the reading of this book. Oh for more and more men to come forth who are full of integrity and desire to do the will of God. This world needs the true strength of godly men (and women). Those who value eternal truths and live their lives by these solid beliefs are who we desperately need to lead our families... our communities... our states... our country.Wonderful, encouraging book."
1,On My Humor,"Just the title of this book made me laugh.I'm surprised that they didn't use the words ""tradition"", ""values"", etc. or other meaningless buzzwords of the loony right."
3,Verbatim 4.7 GB Recordable Media Spindle,"This was a good price for the item specified. I cannot specifically say how good or bad the product is, because it did not work with my system. I would suggest that if you have a ""Lite-on"" VCR, to try another brand of recordable disk, because the Verbatim product did not work with mine."
5,Great disks,I have been using these disks for years and I hardly ever get a bad one. I also like the + as the computer doesn't need to finalize the disk.
4,Good,"I do not like the use of the NIV with an interlinear, but Mounce does a good job. The only downfall is that I didn't realize the size it would be. I would prefer it to be thicker with more pages than the entire book being a thin notebook paper size book."
5,Greek for the rest of us,To my best knowledge this is the best interlinear for the Greek Student that exsts today.Jerry L Crosby Sr
1,Dissapointment,"Dont bother buying this book, Its the NIV with Greek below . I was expecting a more literal version of the bible but insted i got This. Dont waste your time with this book. But If NIV is your version of the bible, this might appeal to you"
1,:-(,Love Gino...Didn't like this at all...too way out and not like the old days...Isn't that why we buy music? To hear what we know???
2,"Love Gino, but...","the selection of songs on this dvd were very disappointing...the few that I recalled were hardly recognizable.Having the conductor in every shot with Gino was annoying. I found myself watching him waving his stick around & wondering why he is even there...none of the musicians were even paying attention to him.Oh well...90% of all dvds that are purchased are usually watched once & then tossed aside never to be viewed again., this one will be no exception."
5,Phenomenal!,"Whether or not you are a fan of Gino Vannelli's, this DVD is a must for music lovers. His talent is nothing like you have ever seen or heard or will ever hear again. Gino is truly one of a kind and has a gift and a vision with his music, that noone has ever been able to copy. The orchestra is unbelievable and with Gino's talent and the talents of the conductor & musicians, you will enjoy the sounds of every instrument, every note and will be hypnotized with the beauty & sounds of this DVD. And if you are a big Gino Vannelli fan, this is the next best thing while waiting for his next concert!"
5,Good DVD,"VeryNorth Sea Jazz Festival 2002Good image and perfect Sound !!! It's an amazing concert with the North Sea Jazz, they play beutiful songs like Walter Withman Where Are You, Wild Horses, Living inside myself,... but also King for A Day which is astonishing and gives another sound, different from the CD !If you like Gino Vannelli's music you should buy this DVD !!! You'll enjoy his performance mixed with the North Sea Jazz SOUND !"
4,Gino to the fore.,"It's great to hear the way Gino reworks and expands his old standards, using the orchestra to good effect. I felt the vocal quality was not as good as usual, the effects masking his usual impeccable diction, but allowing for it being an outdoor concert, I guess we could not expect studio perfection.The video quality was excellent, the players superb, the conductor seemed to be enjoying himself, and overall a great product.It is good just to see, in person, what a wonderful artist Gino is live.The accompanying booklet is an interesting anthology, but lacks any orchestral personnell listings, especially the rhythm section, who feature and star throughout. They deserve a mention."
2,Not what I expected,I was hoping that Gino would have had a more in depth concert with the many poplar hit songs that he put out on his original albums when he got started. I also wished that he could have had some of his original musicians with him if they are still living. He still has his good voice but I didn't recognize many of the songs on this DVD. I have all of his albums and I love listening to Gino. This is my look at him in a video format. I hope that there is another DVD which has more recognizable songs included.
5,If You're Into Cowboy Action Shooting Or Even History ...,"If you're into Cowboy Action Shooting or even history of the Old West, this is a must have book. The pictures are fantastic and the way the book was put together gives the reader an extremely great view of what they wore in the old days. Plus, there are some great pictures from the cowboy movie and television era. Great Book!"
5,Definitive & Beautiful Book,This is the definitive guide to Western holsters. It accurately describes the history and the different types of holsters. It is a standard reference guide for Cowboy Action Shooters.The photographs are first-rate. They clearly show the gun leather details.
5,Great table top book as well as a history of gun leather,What can I say other than I understand why the cowboy action gun leather makers call this their bible. I have a holster that is made from one of these images that turned out perfectly. The book has not only great pictures but is really informative as well.Packing Iron: Gunleather of the Frontier West
4,The best in hardcover western gun books!,You can't beat this coffeetable book for the best in Gun Leather books of the Old West...fine photography and prose to go with it. Highly recommend!
5,This watch rocks!!,"I bought this watch yrs ago and put it through hell, not only did it pass the test, it hasnt lost time once on me, nor has it ever given me any problems. I highly recommend this watch to anyone looking for a great watch with great durability for a great price!"
4,good times,"this is an enjoyable record... Delta City Blues is a great way to end the record. Sure, it's some showing off, but what a blast.El Nino is a great track. Brecker's ballad playing is very sweet on this one. Joey Calderazzo definitely smokes throughout.Wasn't this the regular touring group at the time? In any event, I recommend this one. Like Brecker's better albums, a good collaborative effort makes for a nice album.Shawn"
3,"Worthy spotlight, decent collaboration","Brecker is a fiery, if familiar tenor saxophonist who often works best in solo mode, offering his polished take on Coltrane's pioneering sheets-of-sound method. He definitely makes the case for technical fluidity but composing and leading a group are a smaller story. Though there are a few attempts at unique songwriting and some bold synergistic passages, much of these sessions degrade into generic-ville when the interplay veers towards autopilot."
5,From a musician's POV...,"A phenominal album that really showcases Michael's (as well as the rest of the band's) musicianship. A combination of styles accents this album's technical aspects. A powerful brass section, a solid rythym section and the finger-twisting saxes all support Michael's solo piece, ""Delta City Blues"". The technicality of this piece really demonstrates the raw talent posessed by these musicians The overall energy, talent, skill and style presented in this album is well worth the price and waiting for it in the mailbox."
2,Did not receive color I ordered...nor does the pic match now,"Overall this appears to be a decent little backpack and was the size I was hoping for. However, the color/pattern pictured when I placed the order was not at all what I received. THEN when I got online to double check...making sure I wasn't crazy...the picture had changed. The new picture was NOT the color/pattern I ordered NOR the color/pattern I receieved. Very deceptive. I returned te item."
5,small,"oh! this is a small bag. But this is really cute. I liked the color too. At first I said that I would return it, but when I saw it in person it is a really good bag. You can put a lot of things in."
5,Better than the Call of the Wild!!,"Loved White Fang so much I have gone on and read everything this man ever wrote. If you love the outdoors, and can live without T.V. a few nights then get this one. You will not regret the money well spent."
2,fun but other reviews were right..,"Very fun game, but im one to read reviews BEFORE buying anything and I noticed ppl saying that the stylus was touchy with this game. They were right :( You have to hold the pointer just right or you missmark or you just dont go the right way. Really sucks but if you take your time its a fun game."
3,different,"A bit plain, but keeps you playing one screen after another. Not flashy with colors, but makes you think following the puzzle. Dont lift up the stylus or you will start the screen over."
2,polarium,"It's a little intense and addicting for such a mindless game. But, if you like having your mind wiped and gritting your teeth for hours at a time, it's great."
5,It's only black and white....,"It's only black and white... leave it to the men in my life to whine about the colors. I love this game, who cares if its only two colors, geesh. ;-) An excellent puzzle game. I love the complexity of it and it helps with my visual spacial learning issues. Only usurped lately by Hotel Dusk 215. Play on! ;-)"
2,Not so fun.,"Make sure that you read other reviewer's full descriptions of this game. I bought this based on their reviews but I was disappointed. I found this game a bit tedious and monotonous, not very challenging at all. It is an easy way to kill time but that is all. So read the descriptions carefully before buying. Fortunately, this game is pretty inexpensive."
3,Mind Numbing,"Yes, it is mind numbing, but that isn't a bad thing. Somedays that is exactly what I need; to put my mind and hands towards doing something that wipes out all other thoughts from my mind. And this does it well! It is challenging, however if you are looking for pratice or a way to just sit and do this endlessly, they have that built into the programming. It is fun, and it is challenging. As mentioned in some of the reviews, the game is very touchy registering the stylus, so if you get in a hurry squares will get mis-marked and you have to go back and unmark them, wasting time. But isn't that what challenging is about?!"
3,Polarium - DS,Hello I'm autistic adult gamer...This is a hard game for me to play it's really hard to figure out but it's also fun in the other point because I like challenges. This game is frustrating but fun. Get this game if you like a challenge.Happy Gaming!
2,Excuse to sell house plans,"While this book contains limited basic information regarding solar design, it really is a house plan book. Unless you are interested in buying her house plans, save your money."
3,"Moment to Moment, I wondered if it would ever improve","Although I wouldn't rate this as a five-star film, I'm thrilled to have found it for my collection and it had its moments. It was certainly great for the soap-opera fodder, but what was with Mark Dominick getting all weird after he and Kay got together? That totally came out of left-field.Honestly, the best parts of this movie were any scene with Honor Blackman. She portrayed Kay's next door neighbor with just the right bit of wackiness, which was a pleasant surprise for me, having only seen her in serious roles.Three stars is the best I can give this movie: one for the soap-opera story and two for Ms. Blackman's performance."
5,An Oldie back when movies were good!,"This is a great movie if you still like movies where you can use your mind and don't have to have the screen filled with naked bodies and full of foul language. Actors and actresses today could not carry this story without it being one bed scene after another. Instead, in this oldie, we get the old time husband's away, wife is lonely, attractive nice sailor is in town. All the ingredients add up to something that shouldn't have happened. There is a price that must be paid. Folks character will determine what that price will be. A story with a moral! How neat!"
5,Why isn't this on DVD??!!,"This seems to be a film many folks have thought of over the years since seeing it in their youth. It is that for me as well. I remember it as rather sad, and dark, yet hauntingly romantic. I have a mental picture of falling leaves as the theme plays...in fact it is the theme that got me thinking of it again. Hopefully we will get it on DVD soon. Jean Seberg's fragility and depth made her one of the better actors of her era."
5,AWESOME,"Great, you will not be able to put it down. Very relaxing, soothing, awesome jazz. Just what the doctor ordered, after a long hard day."
4,Another winner from Baby Einstein,"This is a short, simple book about cats designed for infants and up. Like all of the Baby Einstein books, the illustrations are a combination of drawings, photographs, and famous works of art. Most babies and toddlers are fascinated by cats--especially those from families with a pet cat--and this book is likely to capture their imagination while also teaching some basic facts (eg, a baby cat is called a kitten). Plus, the extra-small size makes it conveniently portable for car, diaper bag, or wherever. A nice little gift for the little one in your life!"
2,Cats (Baby Einstein),"A little underwhelming. My 9 month old daughter has little interest in these Baby Einstein books (we also have ""Dogs"" and ""Babies""). The size is smaller than you would expect, but the real problem is that the content is not very exciting."
5,Great for travel,"This book is small so it doesn't take up space in diaper bags, and great to entertain baby with a small package."
2,not what I expected,I guess this book is ok for a baby (6 months) but not a toddler. It is so tiny and only has a few words.
4,Looks great.,The only thing that would make this better is if the sleeves could be removed or arranged in a different order.
3,A bit lost in descriptions...,"Unfortunately, I would too often come out the other end of a chapter realizing that I had only really learned a small handful of facts that I could universally use. The convoluted drawing descriptions tended to leave me a bit cross-eyed and I found the illustration captions did a better job of explaining what the entire page just did. Still, it does offer enough useful information overall, but despite all the drawing technique, does not really offer many basic solid rules of perspective. Leans a bit more on memorizing techniques in an array of possible circumstances rather than understanding the basics which can then be applied to any circumstance. The book is worth reading however, particularly since it is so short that you will hardly lose anything by doing so, and will likely gain some useful knowledge along the way."
1,Not good value,"I was disappointed with this book. I thought that it might be more useful than it was. The information about the rules of drawing objects in space was too fundamental for the price of the book. There are competitors in the market who do a better job of explaining the interesting difficulties of representing the illusion of the recession of objects in space with greater detail and clarity. Not a lot can be said in its favour, because it's just too basic and dear."
3,Almost Beliveable Storyline!,"I am really tired of the same tired old storyline where the poor, helpless victim is abused and brutilized by some sadistic, powercrazy psycho. Thank goodness there are more women writing spanking porn that understand that we need to know that both parties are willing participants, who just pretend not to be. I liked this book much better than Veitch's other titles because it didn't go too far - not too brutal, not too much humiliation and a little bit of humor!"
5,An important book that shows the human side of a terrorist,"Even without the current problems in the Middle East, this would be a wonderful book to read and think about.The book centers on an unnamed narrator who is planning on carrying out a suicide bombing. Throughout the book, we are witness to his thoughts and experiences as the day of the attack nears. We find out how he has come to this moment in time, with a bomb strapped on his back, and what he thinks about his life and future.Highly Recommended"
5,pilosopher in phily,"disturbing (but i liked that). berberian imaginatively explores the dark (and at times darkly funny) side of middle eastern life. this book is intriguing, eerie and fascinating. if you have lost your job in the current recession and have time to read, pick this one up at the library. the philadelphia inquirer calls it a most original book of the year. i was disappointed, however, of the negative image it portrays of attorneys. whatever."
2,"Interesting, but.","I wanted to like this book better. The prose is lovely and strange (even rhyming at times), but in the end I couldn't make head or tail of it. Yes, the narrator is a prospective terrorist, yes, he's planning--with his comrades--to blow up a fancy Beirut hotel, but the reason is mysterious. There's anger and determination, but the focus of those emotions is unclear. What's clear is that the character loves food and loves his girlfriend; with so much focused love, it's hard to credit the muddled motivation to violence."
1,How Did This Ever Get Published?,"Amazingly bad prose combined with an anemic plot, an unsurprising denouement and fuzzy characters, this book isn't worth the paper it's printed on. It does absolutely nothing to elevate one's understanding of the forces at play that lead to suicide bombings in the Middle East. I had hoped to gain an understanding of those last-minute chaotic thoughts that rush through the mind of someone carrying out such a terrible mission, but this novel was a pure waste of time. Perhaps the worst element? His habit of rhyming within sentences which made me wonder whether his book had received any editorial guidance whatsoever."
1,tedious,"I wish I could have submitted a favorable review of this book. Unfortunately, it was long-winded, little content, and a tedious read."
4,you'll get used to this,"At first you'd think the vocals were retarded, but you look at the lyrics and combine the complex double pedal drumming, and the dark electric guitars, and it's all good. The best of best songs are 1,3,and 10"
2,I tried,"I tried getting into morbid angel, but they just didn't impress me. I'm not going to bash them, I know they are like one of the death-metal fathers which I respect. But, I just don't like their music. Don't like the vocals and the music compared to other death metal bands. Just didn't do it for me."
4,brutality and technicality Morbid Angel style!,"One of the best death metal CDs out there. David Vincent's finest vocals, awesome down tuned chunky Trey-style riffage, and great percussion work by death metal legend Pete Sandoval. A great album with lots of diversity as well...""Angel Of Disease"" incorporates punk rock elements, and ""God Of Emptiness"" is a death metal masterpiece in its own right. BUY COVENANT TODAY!"
5,Enter The Blackened Void,The songs on Covenat are not as catchy as their previous albums or the super catchy Domination. So here you have a Morbid Angel album stripped down to the brutal foundations requiring no or very little catchy riffs and leads. There are some catchy moments but not too many and that opens up a blackened void of thundering and flowing depth unheard on any other Morbid Angel album to this extreme anyway.
3,Deep into the dark,"Morbid Angel's ""Covenant"" is a pretty good release and in a way combines their sound from their first 2 albums with chaos and doom and aggression. However for me I felt like this was the weakest album from them with David Vincent. The vocals were fine, the overall sound was fine as well, but the songs just didn't click with me easily as the first 2 albums did and Domination. Dare I say it it may sound a little ""commercial"" at some points (or at least enough to get recognition and a parental advisory label on the album cover) but nonetheless it's still pretty solid for a typical death metal release. It just didn't seem as unique as their other albums with Vincent."
5,Fantastic Get-To-Know-Others Game,"This is our family's favorite game. It has cards with names of people, foods, recreation, etc. (ice skating, going to a movie, paying taxes, standing in a checkout line). A player picks out four cards and then secretly ranks them in order of preference, then the others guess what order they are ranked in. A great game to play with people you are trying to get to know--lots of laughs and surprises. The only negative is that it's a little dated (1987) so there aren't a lot of current names. We have played it so much that the cards have frayed edges!"
5,jim croce,"This cd encompasses Jim's entire recording career,showing his roots and his growth into one of the greatest acoustic songwriters of our time.He will forever be missed...and forever immortalized in his songs and in our hearts."
5,compilation,"Great compilation of singer/songwriter's too brief career. All the good stuff is included here. Well worth the price covers his hits, plus."
3,"FAR from ""complete""","This is FAR from complete. There are only 50 tracks here, and I have a 3 cd set with 66 tracks, and IT is missing at least 2.That's not to say that this is a bad set. It's just NOT COMPLETE."
5,Smooth,Bought as a christmas present. The product shipped fast and before christmas even though it was ordered late. Arrived in great shape!
4,rockin blues,"son of the late jimmy rogers ""long gone"" is a collection of mostly covers,if you love that heavy influence of hednrix and svr you will love this cd. great covers ""hear my train a comin"" amd ""boom boom boom"""
3,Back lane Jimmy.,A fairly average blues album and what compounds the problem is his lyrics are very hard to understand.
3,it's okay,"Not the most original sounding blues rock cd I've heard but it does have a few catchy tunes. I especially like ""Boom Boom Boom"" and ""Rollin' Stone"". Jimmy's voice is rather limited and his guitar playing is good but not great. Unless your goal is to own every blues rock cd on the market, you can pass on this one."
5,Enjoyable!,"Pat Samples writes that aging can bring new experiences to ones body. As a woman who is approaching 50, Pat's book made me aware that a person of any age can celebrate their body. I am no longer apprehensive of growing old. Thank you Pat, for writing such a delightful book!"
5,Midnight,"Die arrived as planned, on time and works well. I am happy with this product and the price was way better than other sources for the same thing."
2,Broken during the first use,"Made almost the half threading for the shower and it broke. It still worked for me somehow, but I'm disappointed by its quality."
3,"Easy read, interesting story","I read this story for a children's literature class. It was a thoughtful story with interesting characters. The summary on the book makes a bigger deal about the story's ""mystery"" than it actually is. Toward the end of the story, the mystery is not really that big of a deal...but that doesn't make the story disappointing in any way, as it does end well. The story is set in England, and there are some terms and situations that a younger reader, not familiar with England, might have questions about. There are several young characters, who are well-developed and easy to distinguish. In addition, there are several, less well-developed, adult characters. I found myself having to take longer to recall which adult was which and felt this could be somewhat confusing for younger readers. This would be a good leisure read for students in grades 3-6."
4,"A ""gentle"" mystery for upper elementary","Young Calum moves to Beckerton, his family's ancestral town, and learns that the village is not so welcoming to newcomers. He becomes involved with an ancient tradition and a not-quite-as-ancient mystery, making friends along the way. I would classify this story as a ""gentle"" read, recommending it to children who don't want anything scary and/or to parents who don't want violence, occult, sexuality, or similar issues in their children's literature. Offered by Eerdmans, a Christian publisher, the religious element is very subtle in this title."
1,Cheap,"This is by far a waste of money, all it is is plastic, and it doesn't even resemble lava rock what so ever. When I finally got sick of looking at it in my tank, I took it out. When I took it out the holes on the bottom of the cave that fill with water to prevent it from floating were full of nasty, bad, smelling, black algae, pretty gross. I definately don't reccommend this product. The only reason I gave it one star is because it arrived ahead of schedule."
4,Lived couple of streets over when the murder happened,"Wow! It was very good, I read it all in one evening. I found that I either know or at least had heard of just about everyone in the book. Having grown up in Fort Walton Beach it was like getting to revisit home. Some of the places mentioned are now long gone. I lived a couple of streets down the road from the murder scene at the time the murder happened. The book gave insight to infomation that just wasn't know before I left the area."
4,Fascinating story - poorly edited,"Maybe it's because I grew up in the same town and went to high school with Myra (the murderess wife in this true-life drama), but I was unable to put this book down once I started reading it. I heard the same comment from other people who read the book before me. Of course it's always more interesting when you're one of the locals and know the main characters and places mentioned in the storyline, but this would be a fascinating read regardless. True crime stories usually are!I was very disappointed in the number of grammatical errors and misspellings in the book and wish the author had hired a professional editor. Even running spell check would've caught most of the errors! That's the only drawback I saw to an otherwise fascinating and well researched story."
5,PERFECT TRIBUTE ALBUM TO THE EAGLES,"I bought Common Thread for myself about 15 years ago. I now give it for presents. It was love at first listen. The best of the Eagles songs beautifully done by some of the best country singers around. There was no effort to imitate the Eagles, each artist made each song exceptional in his or her own way. Also, it's a wonderful ""survey"" course of some of the finest country singers around at that time, many still singing, including Martina McBride, Susy Bogguss, etc. Buy it!"
5,ITS FANTASTIC,"Ive been hearing some of the songs on the radio station I listen to, so I googled , found the name , went to amazon. com and ordered it and I just love the whole album. The stars who contributed are so great and some we havent heard from in awhile, its like old friends back on the scene again. I am thrilled beyond words"
2,OK,"THE CD WORKED BUT I WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THE WAY THE CD WAS PACKED. THE CD WAS PUT INSIDE THE PAPER COVER'S AND SHIPPED TO ME. OTHER THEN THE WAY IT WAS PACKED, I WAS HAPPY."
2,Please... don't buy this toy.,I have had some cons with this toy lately. The important thing I have experienced is when the coin drops in the chute it turns on/off which there are actually two switches and originally I see one. After like two minutes the toy turns itself off and memory is stored. So I highly suggest don't buy this and waste of money!!!!
3,Good concept - need work.,"Overall, the concept of the talking bank is good. But Leap Frog needs to improve on their selection of music and the constant repetitions. They should add more information as the child's goals are achieved and each time the bank is emptied. Also, a real lock would be better than the plastic one.My child enjoys putting money into the bank,Put finds pushing the money in takes more effort than need be.Keep working at it Leap Frog-it is a good product!"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE- Parents beware-LeapFrog does not have customer support,"This toy was bought for my son. I have returned the bank twice. It does not read the coins correctly. It thinks a quarter is a nickle. I have contacted customer service 800-701-5327 for LeapFrog and was put on hold for over 25 minutes. I was advised that I can ship the product back at my cost and they will review the product and ship a new one. I asked why I should have to pay for shipping on THEIR faulty product-I was advised that there is notjing else they can do and the call was ended. There is no customer service support-my child is very confiused and I have removed the toy from our house. I was given a number by the ""manager"" at LeapFrog and was only able to leave a message for the main office customer servcie 510-420-5341-was told on the recorded message the call would be returned in 24 hours. The call was never returned."
4,BETTER THAN EXPECTED,"I bought this for my 3-year-old daughter the other day. It is better than I anticipated. Firstly, It says the denomination of money deposited. It then tells you either a famous president is on the coin or what combination adds up to the amount deposited i.e.: a quarter=$.25 or five nickels=a quarter.Secondly, it sets small goals for young children to attain and keeps a running tally of the money deposited.This bank is made for preschoolers to help them understand the concept of saving money and to help them learn the monetary denominations of the coins they put in.My daughter was very proud of herself as she approached her first $5.00 goal. She could care less about the ""mechanical gears"" on the inside. What intrigues her most, as with most 3 & 4 year olds, is that she is learning how to save BY HERSELF!!"
3,A bit disappointing,"As other reviewers have posted, this bank has a very small drawer to hold the money. I was disappointed with it for that, as well as a few other minor things. The ""goal setting"" option wasn't realistic for the size of the item, either. I'd like to see a few more features as far as money counting goes, too.The little rhymes it uses to identify coins are cute, but they're not enough to overshadow the other flaws.It's not worth $20.00+, IMO."
2,Money removed too easily,"I was hoping to re-create the bank I had when I was a child. You set a goal and the bank would only open when that amount was reached. It's great that you can set a goal with this bank, but it doesn't matter because the money can be removed and reinserted EASILY. In fact, that is my kids favorite thing to do. I wanted to teach them the value of saving, but it is not possible with this bank. The learning values it teaches are great and it is fun to put money into it, but the value of reaching a goal is lost."
3,Not enough space,"We just bought this bank the other day for my 5 year old son with the intent on it being an actual bank he could keep his coins in, BUT there is not enough room. Once it gets too heavy (which was after about $11, you have to empty it. The back also comes off really easy (my 19 month old boy could open it!!), too. If it weren't for those to problems, it would be perfect!!"
5,Arrow in the Sun = Soldier Blue,"Acutally just a note: This book was eventually titled ""Soldier Blue"" after the movie of the same name (Candice Bergan, Peter Strauss - late night TV, etc.). So, if you own Soldier Blue, you own Arrow in the Sun."
5,A beautiful book!,"This is a very beautiful book. It tells of how much Jesus loves us. It's a book that draws you to a closer relationship with the Lord. I very highly recommend it. It shows men and women alike that Jesus is the Bridegroom of their souls, as we our the church the bride of Christ, and He is our Groom. These women have opened their hearts to write this book, and for that I'm grateful. Their book really touched me and bad me feel closer to Jesus then ever before. Bravo ,ladies well done!"
5,Absolutely Beautiful! A Must-Have for the Romantic at Heart,"A Father and child relationship is not the only way God relates to us-- He is so much more! This wonderful book takes the reader on a journey to discover how our God can romance us into a love relationship with Him that will see us through the joys and sorrows of our lives. Anyone who sees it as ""sexual"" has sadly missed the beautiful, romantic message of this book. It is written by women and geared mostly toward women, both married and single. One of the most touching parts of this book are the excerpts from Kathy's personal journal as she struggles with waiting for the man God will provide for her. This book changed the way I see God and the way I see being single resulting in a joy and contentment I had not felt before. It is a true blessing that should be shared!"
5,Recent decades have seen...,"Recent decades have seen an ever-increasing number of Western Christians going abroad as English teachers. Many of these teachers are going to countries that are not very receptive to other forms of Westermn Christian mission. Some Western Christians view English teaching primarily as a means to gain access to ""closed"" countries for the purpose of evangelistic outreach. Others see it mainly as a form of social service. Donald B. Snow's well-thought out details of how to bear witness, engage in ministry, serve the poor, contribute to peace, and build bridges of understanding between churches clearly show the special role in Christian mission that Christian English teachers can have."
1,WARNING: CONTAINS PETROLEUM,"This is an absolute scam. The name ""Cococare Cocoa Butter"" led me to believe this product was based on Cocoa Butter. That is not the case at ALL. The first and primary ingredient is PETROLEUM! What?? Why would they try to make a product based on CRUDE MINERAL OIL that's used for GASOLINE look as if it were a healthy product based on natural cocoa butter?Absolutely deceiving - No ingredients listed on this page. Probably because they know it would scare people away. You're better off buying Vasoline and rubbing it on your lips if you don't care about your health.For me, I threw it away instantly. Not only does it taste and smell bad, but it didn't work well, AND it's based on petroleum with one of the last ingredients being actual Cocoa Butter.DO NOT BUY thinking this is a natural product. It is a product which is very damaging to your lips. Seriously, common, the primary ingredient is used to make gasoline! Think about it."
2,it stinks!!,i love the way it makes my lips look and feel. but the smell is nuts!!! it smells nothing like coconut. it smells like 80's grandma avon perfume!!! but its cheap. ill use it when i'm desperate.
1,Hated it!,"I bought this and instantly hated it upon opening it. I can't even stand the smell when applying it to my lips, such a strong scent."
3,Really soft,"The lip balm is too soft for me. You have to be careful not to put any pressure on the balm when applying to your lips. What also bothers me (and yes, I am just being picky), is that the stick itself gets lumpy. It's almost like the balm itself is a bit chunky. I have even cut the end of the balm off with a knife to get a smooth surface, but it always turns bumpy again.It does smell good, though and feel good on your lips. I don't think it really lasts very long on your lips, though. I prefer theNeosporin Lip Health, Daily Hydration Therapy SPF 20 .35 oz (10 g)in the white tube. That stuff works really well!"
2,Ello Rip Off Party Planet,"Sellers who jack prices up this much for hard to find toys should be ashamed of themselves. It's a good toy, but it's not a Cabbage Patch Doll. Parents and grandparents are at the mercy of pirates."
2,No build quality at all.,"I bought this bulb as a replacement bulb in a Lava lamp. It was the same size, shape and wattage as the original bulb. However the lava lamp did not respond to this bulb as it did to the original, furthermore the bulb only lasted a month."
5,Perfect for Lava lamp,I have been looking for this bulb for a new lava lamp..Havent been able to find it anywhere then ..while on Amazon..found this..it is absolutely perfect ..Thank You
2,dies fast,"the bulb took weeks to arrive and once i got it from the mail . the bulb dies within 3 weeks, terrible product."
4,get it,"i like the whole cd but the song, ""Your Mercy"" has helped me get thru some tought days and i think this cd will help others also. it's uplifting!"
5,Proof that Jackie McLean doesn't know how to make bad music,"We all know that Jackie McLean made nothing but terrific albums for Blue Note during his first tenure there. Capuchin Swing, along with A Fickle Sonance, were two that I waited for at Tower till midnight so I could listen to it as soon as humanly possible. Jackie's tone is at it's peak, his ideas are constantly refreshing (40 years after it was recorded, even) and I cannot help but wonder why on earth more modern musicians aren't influenced by him. I own everything by Jackie, and hell, my band was even named after a quote in his liner notes to Let Freedom Ring. This is among the best McLean albums I own. Buy one for your home stereo, one for your car, and one for at work. You'll thank me later."
3,Great coastings,"Although it is a perfectly swingin' old school, early 60's post-bop Jazz release from well rounded talent, besides for a few standout melodies, suffers from typical call-and-response formulaic trappings of front and center soloing over compelling interplay."
3,"Intense passion, curious characters, and male dominance","If you don't mind formulaic romance that's heavy on male dominance, these two novelettes are entertaining reads. In the first, the heroine is a slightly ditzy reporter, and in the second, a more capable managerial professional. Each woman more than meets her match, and each story details the heroine's slowly dissolving resolution to remain independent. Since both heroes are unusually attractive, wealthy, and brilliant, the capitulations are presented as inevitable. There's plenty of passion and a raft of entertaining characters to add to the entertainment value."
5,Quantum physics has never had so much appeal...,"High Energy has almost convinced me (a die-hard humnanities person) to delve into the hitherto unfathomable field of physics -- especially if I could find an instructior like Ty (little chance)...anyway, if one doesn't appreciate physics one will after reading High Energy. This book could easily stand on its own merit without the added inducement of Ms. Krentz (whom I also read avidly). However, the unique storyline and characters of Ms. Joy's book warrent recognition in themselves. She peoples her books with eccentric characters who are worth the time one spends in their company -- and whom most romantics will want to revisit again and again. Just visiting the hero's home would be worth a read even if he weren't a hero worth a dream or two. I am not a contemporary romance fan as a rule, but this book satisfies most romantic dreams...and offers a mini-science lesson in the bargain"
1,big disappointment!!,"I liked American McGee's other game alice, much better. In this game my main gripe is that, aside from the game being linear in every way imaginable, THE MUSIC CUT OUTS FOR HOURS AT A TIME!!! It's like watching a real cartoony cartoon without sound: useless"
1,"Bad Game, LAme","I am a huge American McGee fan but this game is shamefully bad. The mechanics of the game would have been better had they been written by chinese gold farmers. This game is not worth the box it came in.Buy Alice, or if you played that buy Scrapland instead."
3,Price Gouging,Why are you charging so much for this product? It really is price gouging. You don't really care about your customer.
2,New Brand Available,"Check out CoSaMo Love Your Color, there is: NO ammonia, NO peroxide, NO PPD, it is a non-permanent, water-based hair color that is cheaper and not discontinued!!"
3,Decent lens for price,"I mainly bought this lens for the wide angle lens and just thought I purchase the pack to try out the telephoto.As many of the review states, you will get black edges around with the wide angle lens, but you can remove it by zooming in a little bit.The telephoto lens is pretty bad and almost unusable. I will rarely be pulling it out, but I was kind of expecting it.The adapter step up ring doesn't fit very well. I figured out the problem, and the cut on the thread on the step up ring was not evenly cut, but I ordered a separate one anyways, so it does not matter to me.Overall, this is a decent wide angle lens with good quality to start with, but don't expect too much from this lens set."
3,Decent but not great,"The wide angle lens is very nice. the telephoto lens is okay, but apparently the lens does not screw far enough on to the camcorder, creating a ghosting effect, for example, when taking a picture of the moon. The ghosting is only slight but it is enough to offset the detail that the 8-12 MP resolution offers. All in all, for the price, I recommend these."
3,Wide Angle = good / Telephoto = bad,"It's a good price for a wide angle lens at under $12. Ouch, looks like it went up since then.Anyway, it's a decent wide angle, but the telephoto creates a strong soft focus effect in high contrast situations. The blurry glow was a deal breaker for me on this one."
4,wideangle supplemental lense,"Not fully tested yet, but helpful to expand field of view. Anticipate minor loss of resolution"
3,Dust Will Ruin It,"These lenses worked out perfectly until somehow dust creeped inside my wide lens. It didn't last too much longer because I dropped it on the cement while on vacation and put a nice crack down the center. It was fun while it lasted, but not something that is meant to be around forever."
4,Best I've Used,"Hooked it into my system and it took right off - no complicated installation. It has a stronger signal than the Linksys that it replaced and it does not have to be reset often as was the case with the Linksys. The negative - I have had a couple of instances in which the signal from this router seemed to ""fade"" out and then return."
1,I restart my network 5-10 times a week,"I am so freaking tired of this piece of JUNK! Every web-enabled item I've ever put on this piece of crap has had problems. Please, can I throw it?"
3,recived as a gift,Had to get a RMA for the first unit as it died within one week.I have had no problems since.edit: 9/9/2012 ok this thing is crap it's been having the wifi drop out randomly on me lately have to reboot it at least 3 or 4 times a week.
5,much better than the lynksys one I bought,"I had one of the blue lynksys routers and could never get it configured to work with my system. I tried the call number, nothing worked long term. I had computer whiz kids come over and tinker with it....no good. I saw this on sale and bought it and set it up by myself and it has worked flawlessly since. And the reception works all over the house and it is well over 2500SFT."
4,Very good ittem,"I really enjoy my router, I can take my laptop any where in the house and still get great connection. Even if I sit on the porch, I have no problem. You should get one."
2,This Router is not for Mac users,"I got this router to replace a d-link DL-624 router that died since this manufacture has a reputation for supporting Mac users. Although this router is easy to set up, this particular model has some glaring problems- Our family uses wireless network printing using the Appletalk protocols to several wired printers, but this wireless router does not pass Appletalk printer signals and the printers are not seen on the network. The Belkin Product support services in India have no experience with Macintosh and are of no help. In fact, as a consumer, I kow more about the product and configuration than them, since all they can do is read from scripts. I am relegating the router to a travel router, where I don't need to print something."
3,ok buy,It works great...when it works. It keeps dropping the signal and sometimes it wont work for hours!
3,SUPPORT WAS VERY RUDE,I HAD TROUBLE GETTING THE PRODUCT UP AND RUNNING SUPPORT WAS VERY RUDEBELKIN NEEDS TO HIRE BETTER SUPPORT OPERATORS
2,Router works well. (...),"I bought the router and it does seem to work well for me. I only needed a wireless bridge and the nice thing is that you can disable the router and use it as a wireless bridge, still using WPA encryption.(...)"
2,Drops connections constantly,"Buyers beware! This thing is worthless!! Drops connections all the time. I can't download anything without it being interrupted by a dropped connection. It's not my laptop, PS3, or iPod. Complete waste of money!"
2,Belkin Wireless G Plus Router,"I like Belkin, and bought many Belkin brand items.However, couple of things to remember.1. Wireless Network : Go with N Period. (No B or G)2. Wireless Router : Search for best Gamers Router in the market.It's not Belkin."
4,Great Router,"Another fine Belkin product. I owned this router for over a year, and have since passed it on to my sister. Other than the occassional drop from my cable modem, I had solid wi-fi coverage in a three story townhouse. Typically with ""excellent"" signal strength. I used MAC filtering for awhile then switched to purely WPA-PSK encryption and never had a problem with security. I currently have the Belkin ""N"" router; considering taking it back to the store for the N1, because wi-fi connectivity isn't very solid... so I will probably buy this one again if the ""N1"" is problematic."
1,3 minute setup? Not! Try 3 hour then return item.,"The box says ""3 minute"" set up. Yeah, but only if you don't expect the wirless portion of this dog to work. Every time you try and set up any of the wireless settings, the internet connection drops. You can't change channels, you can't set WEP security. Yeah, 24/7 support was there, and I used several hours. But only after plugging in, unplugging, resetting, rebooting, reinstalling did they escalate to tier two who in one minute admitted that it was defective. Returned, bought another one, and that one is defective too. Bought DLink instead, and had it installed in less than 10 minutes."
4,very enjoyable,"Like most fiction, there is convenient happenings to further the story, but all and all a very good late coming of age story. Can't help but liking the imperfect main character. But foibles aside, he and the book grows on you. Funny, perceptive, topical, melancholic, an all and all good read that gives one a taste of different cultures."
4,Buy This Because of Paul Carrack,"I purchased this because I knew it would contain performances (well remembered) by one of the most underrated songwriters/ singers of the previous two decades(Okay,..my opinion): Paul Carrack.I played this for my wife, who had not recalled Mike and the Mechanics as specifically having performed these songs,..yes, some are indeed dated,.. but a real stand out is ""Over My Shoulder."" I think it's timeless,...Brings back fond memories whenever I play it,..""The Living Years"" will resonate with anyone who is a Father..."
3,Not so far from the late Genesis... Good alliance with Paul Carrack!!!,"What Mike Rutherford has done with his ""Mechanics"", is quite similar with what Phil Collins made with the late Genesis: A Pop-music band that 'decorates' its tunes with some Prog-Rock stuff.However, for those non-Prog-Rock fans, this CD offers some remarkable Pop jewels, obtained thanks to the collaboration of M&TM; with the remarkable Rock musiciam/singer/composer Paul Carrack: ""Over My Shoulder"" (a really beautiful song, the best one in this album), ""Nobody's Perfect"", and even a very silly Disco-ed reedition of ""All I Need Is a Miracle"".A must-have CD for a nice weekend, lazing around at home while having a good cup of warm coffee and the whole Sunday newspaper to read... Enjoy it!"
4,Okay,"Overall a good buy if you are a fan, but ""All I Need Is A Miracle"" sounds more live a live version rather than the studio version."
4,Mike and the Mechanics -- Hits,Had been looking for particular songs on this CD. My daughter and I enjoyed the whole CD. Would recommend to others.
2,"Good compilation but misses the original 1985 ""All I Need is A Miracle""","All the best BUT this album does not feature the original version of what is probably Mike +T Mechs greatest song.It has a corny, overly produced, overly-reworked version of All I Need Is A Miracle.Ok, maybe they had to re-record the song because of label disputes or something, but why make it worse and not better?Avoid it if you want the original 1985 track!!!!!!"
2,A Rhino Rip-Off!!!,"This just seems to be a reissue of M+TM's UK best-of from 1996. That means that the version of ""All I Need Is A Miracle"" here is not the original. When Rhino decided to re-release this, why didn't they include both? As if that wasn't bad enough, this collection doesn't even have all of the group's Top 100 US hits. Usually Rhino does a great job off nailing all the charting singles and adding extra tracks, but in this case they really dropped the ball!"
2,brooklynstar*,Pictures are great computer genarated but did not like the sytle the book is written. Most parts feel made up even though it does has valid information. Author is not belivable.
5,HIDDEN RECORDS - GREAT READING,"What a revelation ! Wayne & Birgit have dedicated years of study, travel and hard work to uncover a most plausible net of intrigue surrounding the relationship between the pyramids of the World and the stars.My wife and I just could not put the book down and we are very comfortable with the probable origins of mankind as put forward here.The explanations of the common layouts of the various pyramids and the star map they portray, come across so vivdly that one wonders how we missed the evidence in ages gone by.This calls for an open mind and is not to be missed. Well done and thanks to both of you. Be sure to publish the book and its sequel as widely as possible. Neil & Liz Whitehead"
5,Truth Conquers All!,"The Hidden Records, when read in conjunction with certain revealing astrological/astronomical Scriptures from the books of Job, Genesis, Exodus, Revelations and others; particularly the Psalms, of the Holy Bible, with a DEEP UNDERSTANDING of the roots of the Hebrew / Arabic / Sanscrit / Chinese / Greek / Sumerian / Latin / Coptic and Syriac words used in these texts, reveals the truth. This is a must read for all free-thinking intellectuals."
1,incompetent author,"I was taken in by the awesome photos off google images from this book. He writes an intro about how no one would publish his book and now I know why. Conspiracy theories are ok with me, but he does not know any type of grammar or punctuation. If I had a dime for every time he uses a ""..."" or a ""!"" in the middle of unfinished thoughts I could buy this website."
