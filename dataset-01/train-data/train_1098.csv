4,Age differences in book and movie,"I found both the book and the movie to be very sad and poignant, like many people. As to the age differences between the main characters in the book as opposed to the movie, someone said ""maybe the director wanted to work with more mature actors."" That could be true, it also could be that at the time the movie was made, there were no 12 year old actresses (or actresses who could look 12) available who were well known enough."
4,Better than expected,"I watched this movie to see Kirsten and was pleased with the movie overall. First off, Kirsten does a very good job in her role. The movie gives the viewer an idea of what was experieced by the jews during the war. For those that want this movie to be exactly like the book, you will be dissappointed. Like every book made into a movie, it's not exactly the same. If it were it'd be a 4 hour movie, it is suppose to be ""based"" on the book. If you want to learn a little history and be entertained, definitely watch the movie. If you have teenage children that were deprived of the history of the holocaust in school, have them watch it. It will be a nice lesson for them."
1,A disappointment,"If you have ever read the book The Devil's Arithmetic then you know that the movie is by far a disappointment. I ended up using it as a teaching lesson and helping my students learn to compare and contrast. However I really expected more from the movie. It was such a great opportunity for the film makers to help teenagers of today make a real world connection to the atrocities of the Holocaust. Instead they changed the plot around only keeping the main idea of the book, cut essential characters, changed the main characters age and her relationship with a significant minor character, added a poor sub plot of a love interest, and the list goes on. The book itself is so powerful that I can not see how the author was not repulsed by the drastic changes made to such a well thought out and organized novel. I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless they were looking for a movie with some big names and terrible acting."
1,The Ultimate Disappointment Collection,"They couldn't have bungled this much worse. This really turns off the fans of the series. Random episodes, no titles or descriptions, no biography or info about the show, a worthless randomized partial listing on the rear cover, cheap packaging with inconvenient access to the discs, really annoying 2 minute commercial on disc 1 for ""upcoming releases"" that cannot be stopped or bypassed, and annoying short intros to the Universal label at the beginning of every disc that also cannot be bypassed. I pretty much hate it. This really hurts since I was looking forward to owning the complete series. Why can't anyone take a hint from Star Trek:DS9 packaging? They did it ALL right!"
1,Season by season,"I havn't bought this DVD collection, but, like everyone else, I would like to see THE WHOLE SERIES come out on dvd, season by season. This was one of my favorite shows growing up as a kid. Tales From The Crypt was just released on DVD,(another HUGE favorite when I was younger,)so, if they bring out The Incredible Hulk I'll be in heaven.As an aside-One reviewer mentions that they have out old shows like Murder She Wrote & I Love Lucy, so, why release s***? Release The Hulk."
2,A little misleading,I was looking for the complete series and got this ultimate collection instead. I looked around and could have gotten the whole series for another 15 dollars. Also when I got received the corners of the case were a little crushed and creased. If your concerned about a displayable case. It had a cheap shrink wrap on it. I beleave it was previously owned. I have not watched them yet but they seem to be good quality discs.
5,The Hulk Finally smashed his way to a box set!!!!!!,"This is what I have been waiting for. A Hulk box set of the TV series on DVD. Bill Bixby was a wonderful actor and played DAvid perfectly. Lou was great as well as the Hulk. Here is what you will get. Prometheous, The First, Death in the Family, Mystery Man, Stop the Presses, The Psychic, The Harder they Fall, Dark side, Deep Shock, Kindered Spirits and a few more. Instead of releasing these in seasons, they are releasing theme discs. The search for a cure, Jack McGee files, The Legend of the Hulk, Powers of the Hulk and more. Sadly there is no extras, but the commentary over the pilot and Married made up for this. So I highly reccommend this DVD set to all Hulk fans because this is what I have been waiting for for years."
4,Where's the rest?,"I was, like others, thrilled to get anything BUT.. I really would like the rest of the series please.Quality is excellent and the menus work in most DVD players ( but not all )"
1,Need season by season!!!,"Need season by season like lost in space,sanford and son,little house on prairie and alot of other shows. If hulk comes out season by season i will buy all seasons pronto.Until then i will hold off.Please put out hulk season by season and so many people will buy them up mark my words!!!!!!!!!"
2,"INCREDIBLE Hulk, PAINFUL release","This Ultimate set gets 2 stars and this is why: it comes with one of the wost packagings EVER! Universal really blew it BIG TIME! First of all, I really like this show and this set is a great opportunity to get some of the best episodes of the series but the packaging really sucks. I mean, come on Universal, couldn't you AT LEAST find the time to make a sleeve for the set??? And a listing of wich episode is on each disc would have been nice too. How about a booklet? Interactive menus? Geez... for hardcore collectors only."
2,Amazon item,"Shipped in a timely manner, however should have showed more information about it being a complete TV series from season 1 thru final season, when I purchased this item these were my exact thoughts at the time thinking I was getting all the seasons of the tv series, which that was not the case, I do like the tv series it just didn't have the complete tv series."
4,Between the Lines,This is an insightful book into the psyche of abuse and denial. A tough read for the soft of heart. But both a page turner and a must read.
4,"If you are a fan of Southern Gospel , you will enjoy this !","Gold City is Southern Gospels' premiere quartet. Through the years they have produced many fine recordings and once again they have produced a winner.""WITHIN THE ROCK"" was produced by the group's baritone, Mark Trammel, and the pianist, Tim Parton. Their hard work has paid off. Favorite songs are : ""HE LIFTED MY BURDENS AWAY""; ""IN TIME, ON TIME, EVERY TIME""; ""THE LAMB UPON THE THRONE"" and ""WHEN HE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR OF MY HEART"". Buy it and play it often to enjoy the best in Southern Gospel Music."
4,Not bad,"This is one of three GC CDs I have and I still like their uptempo songs much more than I do their ballads. I just haven't heard one of their ballads that would make me want to hear it over and over. My favorite songs are ""Isn't He Wonderful"" and ""Gonna Take It and Leave It,"" which are, of course, uptempo songs. I have to say I really like Tim Riley's bass voice. He has a powerful, rich, and deep voice. I think it's a good CD for the uptempo songs, but they make up only about a half of the tracks."
1,Incomplete RC Car,The Car itself is fine. Amazon need to let people that it dose not come with the controler or the power source. It would be helpful to know what the item numbers are for these items. A seemingly reasonable priced RC Car now is very expensive.
1,Not enough info in the description,"Nothing in the desciption of this r/c toy tells you that you have to buy the power module seperately. Let alone the model number you need. This is fine it you already have the power changers system, but if you were just looking to purchase a remote control vehicle with everthing included( controller and power supply), this is not the car to buy!!!"
5,Love It!,"Like other Yamaha audio equipment we have bought, this system provides outstanding sound quality. The small form factor and elegant looking design made it a great choice for our living room. The speakers are small enough to be put on a bookshelf or placed on stands. The one drawback is the single CD player, but the sound quality still compels us to give it a 5 star rating."
3,"Nice sound, cryptic operation",Yamaha MCR-E810SL DVD Mini System looked like a good bet. I listened to it at a local stereo store and was impressed by the sound. I should have played with the controls however & am now paying the price. My wife hates it because she does not understand how it works. My best friend who is a stereo nut likes the sound but was also turned off by the control issues. I'd return it but I feel I've had it too long to justify a return. It does sound nice but one should be able to use it easily & not have to open a manual to change the radio station.
3,Ok for the price,"Pros: This fan cooler seems to work, and the noise level is not that offensive.Cons: Does not come with an AC adapter. I had to find a 5V adapter and modify it to work with this fan."
2,Keeps the Laptop cool......BUT,"The product is plastic (like everything else these days)and it keeps my laptops cool but my main reason for buys this cooler was the built in USB hub. It is advertised as a USB 2.0 hub. On both my laptop a Toshiba and a HP the hub did not report as 2.0 and did not work as 2.0. It did work well for accessories that did not require 2.0. (Mice, keyboards). I requested my money back and received it.Notebook Laptop Cooling Fan Chill Pad Dual Fan Cooler with Bonus built in USB 2.0 hub 2 Features in 1 for Dell C610 P3, Lattitude C610, C600, Sony VAIO VGN-FE770G, VGN-FS660 by Eforcity"
5,"For the price it gets the job done, but its no frills for sure","If you are looking for a laptop cooler to leave at home or in the lab that is also cheap enough to not care about then its great. I got this for under one five shipped. Its made of plastic and is powered by USB from your laptop which means you need to have your laptop connected to power. After looking around most laptop coolers are powered off the the laptop usb itself. If they have dedicated power they tend to be over thirty bucks. Service was ok, it was shipped quick and go to me ok."
1,crappy fan,this is so crappy fan it broke in few days not even a month that it lasted...never buy this piece of crap.
2,not bad,"Had this cooler for a while, but not satisfy with it. I have Dell Inspiron, so it gets terribly hot. This cooler didn't solve my problem. Not enough power, not enough air, etc. Having additional USB ports was a good bonus, but thats about it. Cheap price worth cheap quality."
1,dont buy this product,please dont buy this producti have to chance the usb portand put more fun to have a really coolsystem in my laptop.and the policy of the seller is bad bad bad
3,Good but not great,I am a Kleypas fan so I know what she's capable of and this book did disappoint. The first book in the wallflower series was so good and the character development of Lillian and Marcus introduced in that book caused me to wait anxiously for the second book's debut. I bought it the day it was released (something I never do). Something about the way Marcus and Lillian got together didn't ring true based on the personalities of the two hinted at in the first book and in the previews of this book. Marcus seemed so unlike himself and his almost immediate physical contact with Lillian is so unlike what readers came to expect of this guy in the first book. Honestly I only kept reading to get glimpses of Anabelle and Simon and to see which wallflower would be next in line. I'm really hoping Evie's story will be more in line with the great writing and story development that Ms. Kleypas is known for.
2,i wonder,"did i read the same book as all the other reviewers who gave 4,5 stars? i started to read this book about 30 minutes ago and i lost interest very quickly. the aphrodisiac perfume idea is just ridiculous and it was very boring. one of the worst of her books."
5,Annoying female heroine,"I just couldn't warm up to Lillian. She was supposed to be a strong-willed character, which was fine, but she came off being self-centered in my opinion. What Sebastian saw in her I don't understand. I would have dropped her like a hot potato. Kleypas' Dreaming of You was a far superior novel with characters that were so easy to fall in love with."
4,"Smells like love, tastes American","Lillian Bowman is a very different character from her friend Annabelle in ""Secrets of a Summer Night"".She is not only bold for a woman, but irreverent of some of the most obvious proprieties, like playing baseball. Not watching. Playing.Lord Westcliffe hardly approves and yet finds himself more and more intrigued, and possessive. She smells nice too.While not Lisa Kleypas' best work, this book is highly entertaining, nearly believable, reminds me of being a teen-ager.I started the series with this book and got hooked."
5,Lisa Klepas never disappoints her readers!,"As always, Lisa Klepas delivers! Characters are memorable and touch your heart. It Happened One Autumn has earned a spot on my keeper shelf."
4,Kleypas does it again,"I love Lisa Kleypas. She writes romance so well and her historicals are the bomb.In this novel, the second in the wallflower series is a beautiful tale of unwilling love between two headstrong, vibrant characters.The first Kleypas book I ever read wasAgain The Magicand I always loved Marcus and how he behaved with his sisters and wondered if he would ever get a story and I am so pleased he got his HEA.Lilian Bowman is a bright and vibrant American that both annoys, offends and captivates Marcus Lord Westcliff. They try to fight their towering attraction for oneanother and of course don't succeed. Thank god.I won't go into the details but for anyone who enjoys sexy historical romances, this is one for you!There is one scene where Lilian gets drunk and... safe to say it's hilarious and really really sweet."
3,Good... to OK.... but,"I liked the series 'THE WALLFLOWERS'. The Story writing is great. The Character development is amazing. And one feels very connected to these Four women. Nonetheless, the book had several explicit sexual scenes. I resolved to ignore the scenes and skipped over them when I realized I was being lead into this direction. Nonetheless, the story did not suffer by my doing this, which I can say is not the case with less talented authors whose only ability seems to push the boundaries of decency and lack any true talents. In conclusion, the author is very talented, the stories are interesting but a little too sexually charged. If it bothers you, skip this book or skip over the scenes. Yet if you want to read stories that are truly romantic and do not contain explicit sexual situations you should look into Marcia Lynn McClure. Very good!!!"
2,Not so crazy about this one,"I bought this book after reading Secrets of a Summer Night, which I liked very much. I wasn't crazy about Lillian, the heroine in this book, but I decided to give it a try. I still didn't like her very much as a heroine, nothing to do with Anabelle in the first book. It just didn't convince me as settled on that era, too much sex and a weak story for my taste. Don't get me wrong, steamy scenes like what Simon and Anabelle had on the first book are very good, but in this one, well, the last one I didn't even read it, it was kind of boring at that point.So, if you're looking for hot sex scenes, they by all means buy it. If you prefer a good romance novel, find another one. This will not do."
5,It Happened One Summer,I loved this book and the whole series. Lisa Kleypas is a wonderful author. I have read many of her books and continue to look for ones I might have missed.
5,A Story of Sensual Passionate Explosion!!!!,"I knew from book 1 that Lillian Bowan was going to be my favorite character in the Wallflower series and she is!!! Lillian thinks The Earl Lord Westcliff is a pompous rude man who looks down on her because she is an American and not a lady of the peerage!! Lord Westcliff believes Lllian is very loud scurrilous girl without scruples and any sense of propriety!! Talking about Sexual Explosions between the two of them is putting it mildy!! This story is funny, passionate, sensual and very adventurous!!! I Love the fact that Ms.Klepas includes their sexual encounters through out the entire book and not just the last pages of the book. I could not put this books down and neither will you!! All I can say is HOT HOT HOT!!!!"
5,"Funny, touching and sexy, what more do you want?","Lillian is my favorite kind of heroine, spunky and wild. She's the perfect disruption to Marcus's stoic facade. I re-read the book last night after reading it about 6 months ago and it was just as good the second time around. I actually laughed out loud in some parts of the book. This is how a romance novel should be."
5,2nd title in the Wallflowers series,"'It Happened One Autumn' by Lisa Kleypas was wonderful from the beginning until the end. The two main character started the hatred for each other in 'Secrets of a summer night' and now they are at house party together for whole month. This book has mystery, danger, love and wonderful fights. I am off to get the third book in the series 'Devil in Winter'."
3,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to reading this book, which picks up where the first one ends. But the fiesty Lillian of the first novel seems to have disappeared in this story. Westcliff seems much the same character as he was in the first book, and his character I enjoyed. But Lillian seems to have gone from this independent, strong-minded woman to very much a wallflower, almost ditzy at times. And I really disliked what happens between Lillian and St. Vincent. As a dramatic device in the story, it just wasn't plausible to me. It didn't make sense. His character does a complete about-face. It especially bothered me since I'd previously read Mine Until Midnight, I think it is, in which St. Vincent is written so differently, he might be another character entirely who just happens to have the same name. Not sure I'm going to bother reading the remaining books in the Wallflower series. I've really enjoyed her other books, but this series just doesn't do it for me."
3,Bland,"I was really looking forward to reading Marcus' story. And Lisa Kleypas is hands down my favorite romance author. The story was certainly readable, but it felt a little bland and quite frankly cliche. I didn't feel the growing love between the two characters. I had to just assume the two were in love based on the fact that they told each other so. Kleypas is very good at creating wonderful emotion in her books. This one just didn't ring true."
5,It Happened One Autumn,Loved it! Lisa Kleypas never fails to fulfill all my expectations (and fantasies!). I could not put it down.
5,Couldn't stop reading!,"I read all 5 Wallflower Books in a week. Easy read and extremely enjoyable! The Hathaway series is also really, really good!!!"
5,1000% Chemistry,"Marcus, Lord Westcliff has finally found his match: Lillian Bowman, a precocious American heiress that never backs down from a challenge--or from him! They claim they despise each other, but secretly fantasize about the stolen kisses Marcus soon claims. Because Marcus has shown up in so many of her books, Kleypas's knowledge of who he is really speaks through the story, she creates a likable, noble, human character. The setting, Stony Cross Park (Marcus's estate), has also been mentioned in a lot of her books, it is described extensively in this volume. The estate is a vacationer's dream location, with a horse jumping field, a wishing well, and beautiful gardens for lovers trysts. I bought the large print edition, and with its durable cover and alkaline pages, it should last for many years to come."
5,GREAT CRAFTSMANSHIP!,"These stretcher bars are just what they should be. They are made of finger-joined wood stock, which is necessary to prevent warping of the frame, which will happen if the bars are made of the less expensive plain wood stock. The corners went together perfectly, and they also accept the shims which might be useful if the canvas loosens over time. The price, even with shipping cost, is very reasonable. It should be mentioned that a frame of this size also needs center or corner bracing to prevent distortion of true rectangular shape. FineArtStore also sells braced stretcher bars."
3,THE TOY IS TO SMALL FOR THE PRICE.I PAY 16.95,"THE FIGURE DETAILED WAS 10 INCHES TALL,BUT REALLY WAS ONLY 12CM TALL A BIG DIFFERENT.MY GRANDCHILD ENJOY THETOY ANYWAY."
4,Modern version of the traditional Adidas Spezial,"It is an excellent shoe for indoor sports. They are specifically designed for Team handball, as the Adidas Stabil line is. They have low ankle so they allow your feet to have a huge mobility. The shoe allows being in touch with the court, as it has a low sole"
1,poor reprint,"Be careful buying from Pop Culture Graphics, I purchased 10 posters from them and all the 27x40 are low quality reproductions. The Monsters Inc. poster came with smudges from their printing methods. The lettering is fuzzy and the overall image resolution is very pixelated. For the amount that they are charging, I suggest spending a little more and purchase them from a legitimate poster/print dealer."
5,LOVED IT!,My 7 year old daughter and I enjoyed this. Her creativity and imagination amaze me and after enjoying this book she found it easier to write her stories. She enjoys writing and this is a great book to invest in if you have a child who has an interest or a talent for writing.
4,Used once.Very Good set though time will tell. Found same set @Home Depot for $10 less.Only difference is label.Same product.,Used once.Very Good set though time will tell. Found same set @Home Depot for $10 less.Only difference is label.Same product.
5,Vietnam era jets,"Here are the jets the F-4 Phantom, A-6 Intruder, A-7 Corsair II, A-4 Skyhawk and F-8 Crusader. They are get new addition jets."
2,Foundations of Music is not intended for beginners who have little to no experience in music.,"As a collegiate at a junior college; I'd like to provide a detailed description of what this textbook entails.-It describes everything as IF YOU'VE ALREADY KNOW IT; it expects you to know what they're saying, they DO NOT SIMPLIFY-My professor (doctorate in music) even agrees with me and says that this book is horrible to use in course and curriculum, ""What were they thinking?""-The CD is just like any cd with music and rhythm pattern counting (both could be googled)However this book may be good for a MUSIC MAJOR AND MUSIC MAJORS ONLYThankfully even though I've had little experience in music, I was able to grasp the concepts of music. It's good to buy the book if you've already play an instrument AND taking a theory course."
2,not what i expected,The book is titled with cd rom. The seller did not indicate anywhere that the book that i was puchasing didnt have the CD with it. And i needed the Cd for my class. but they were very easy with returns so i was happy.
3,"CD is good, Book not so much",The CD exercises (That come with the book) are very helpful but the actual book itself I didn't find to amazing.
3,Decent,"First off people the reason you don't get a CD is because you're ordering from a secondary seller a USED copy; in which case even if the seller is fulfilled by Amazon that seller can't necessarily guarantee that the copy they acquire to distribute has a CD in every case, it being a previously owned item.But as far as the book itself goes it's not bad, perhaps a little much for noobs; in any case you could teach yourself most of the stuff with google and an instrument or access to one sans the $80. The only reason I got it was because it was required for a class I was taking. I didn't learn a terrible much from it."
3,Where was the cd?,The book was in great condition and its contents were easy to understand. The only issue was that the book was advertised as including the cd-rom and it never arrived inside the book or in a separate package. I did not use the cd-rom anyways so it did not really matter but if it was advertised to have it then i believe it should be included.
5,"Finally, I got the book's CD.",I finally received e-mail from the author. I have to thank Amazon.com here for sending me the CD free of charge.
1,No CD-ROM ! Don't buy this book !,"There is NO cd-rom inside. Yes, Nothing, not even a floppy disk !What is the use of a book titled ""Computer-Assisted"" without any CD/disk ? Tell me !They mention about the CD everywhere! From the front cover to back cover, book description, book content, their web site, etc. GOD, where is the CD?I think this is not Amazon's mistake. The front cover and the back cover of the book clearly say ""FREE CD-ROM INSIDE"".I will try to contact the Authors to see if they will give me the CD! I will post an update here if they do. Until then, please save your money, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK.If you are the authors or anyone who is responsible for this CD-ROM, please do something!"
5,A scathing look at post-Napoleonic French society.,"This novella focuses on the quixotic journey of Colonel Chabert, a remnant of a society long since gone. Ambition, driven by the intense pursuit of money, is the currency of the new bourgeoise society. Honor is a thing of the past. ""The only thing the poor can do is love,"" Chabert says at one point and it might be too much of a truism, but having seen the corruption of the world around him, maybe it is so. Colonel Chabert has travelled the heart of darkness that is 19th Century France."
4,Polished but passionate,"It's easy to dismiss artists like Lorrie as having had their day, but frankly anyone who spends time listening to this CD will quickly realise this is an artist with plenty more to give. The songs are pretty strong throughout (although being Lorrie, there are invitably a couple of clunkers). You simply can't resist the deft touch on tracks like 'You Can't Take That' however and only she could get away with the wishy washy girl/wishy washy world line in the high camp 'Go Away', which transforms itself from tragic to triumphant after a couple of gin and tonics. At least the girl know how to have a laugh. Enjoy!"
3,NOTHING TO BRAG ABOUT!!!,"I didn't think this album was all that great! Some songs were alright but very few! ""Go Away"" and ""One of Those Nights"" are the better ones. She's not as good as she was when she first started out. I give this album three stars because even though its not the best I've heard, its alright for Lorrie Morgan!"
4,a nicely done middle wt thriller,"brosnan is always a good actor. this movie is quite a treat, very watchable. not too great, but certainly not bad at all."
3,Sloppy Kill,"The only real reason to see this is to enjoy Pierce Brosnan cast against type as a burned out hit man with fainting spells a la Tony Soprano. Brosnan is very funny in the role, but the plot is a shaky affair and the straight man character played by Greg Kinnear is hardly believable. This film would have worked better as a black comedy; for some reason it also tries to be tale of redemption. Doesn't really work, but has its amusing moments."
3,Pierce Brosnan steals this show.,"Brosnan plays a creepy yet wierdly amusing aging hitman. He runs into a struggling middle class businessman played by Greg Kinear in a Mexico City hotel bar and begins to wreak havoc in his life. All in all they make a pretty entertaining pairing and the film works as a light off-beat comedy.Brosnan really is different from all the polished James Bondish characters he has portrayed. He comes across as slightly deranged, disheviled and just a bit sleazy,yet likeable.Worth checking out."
2,"Tea: After one sip, I think I'll pass.","Overall this was a total miss for me, story wise.The story follows a hit man (Brosnan) who ends meeting and soon befriending an ""average joe"". A while later, the hitman shows up on the door, of the average joe and his wife, asking for a favor.Obviously, the acting was great, great actors. However, the story was lacking for me. It didn't ""hook me"" into it, whether it was the hitman's character not being strong enough or the plot not being strong enoug, it's a toss up. The story and the main character have to grab me, have to make me want to know how it ends, what happens. That's the whole point of writing movies. You create a great character and then put them in the middle of a fire (so to speak) and push them to their limits.This was ho-hum for me in both areas.So, no, I won't be buying this for my collection."
3,No James Bond But a little entertaining none the less,This movie lets you fill in the blanks about the main character but leaves plenty of questions unanswered. Although the potrayal of the main character was good by Bronsan there was no sharp edge or real character here as in his portrayal as Bond. Supporting cast was ok for what little they had to support. If you can pick up this movie for under $10 it is a good afternoon or late night time killer. Overall the best part of the movie was the ending which was sad because if the entire movie had that kind of twist it would be a lot better.
3,The song of the middle aged hit man,"The hit man in Mexico city is getting old and lonely and tells a younger fellow he meets at a bar what he does.Time flies when you are killing people for a living. The relationship between the Denver businessman and the hit man becomes the theme of the story.I didn't really much like the movie, how it was filmed or the plot, but the actibg was pretty good overall. Hard to take a hit man as comedy reliefor as a ""normal"" occupation..."
3,this movie is entertaining,I Watched this movie with an expecting to be bored but much to my surprise entertained.Its filled with off the wall humor and to see Pierce Brosnan so comfortable in a role.Greg Kinear is funny too as a salesman who meets hit man Brosnan in a mexican bar.Julien Noble{Brosnan} persuades Kenear to help him on a few assignments and the results are hysterical.Hope Davis is great as Danny's wife.Although there is no blood flowing the end result is entertaining.Funniest line I'm like a relief pitcher who fumbles the ball.Kinear replies Do you always mix two sports as a metaphor.Its worth the rent.
4,Ole,"Very entertaining flick with terrific chemistry between the main players. A story of fate that brings together an unlikely pair. Julian Noble, finally becomes noble, at least for a little while. Wright surprises, swerving from his rock-steady morals to aid Noble in his final hit. The movie is a good time, without a doubt."
3,The faciliator of fatalities...,"Pierce Brosnan does have an acting life outside of ""James Bond"". Without his and Greg Kinnear's acting, the film would have died. Pierce plays a lonely hit man kind of looking for a best friend. He meets Kinnear in a bar in Mexico while both are there on business and they begin a friendship. Pierce relates to Kinnear that he is a hit man. The two then went their own separate ways. Pierce shows up on Kinnear's doorstep 6 years later, only to take him on an incredible journey of helping him make the most critical kill of his life. Given the plot, I was looking for more of a thriller/suspense but I didn't get it. It was moving at times, but it dragged on in many scenes. It is worth watching as the two actors make the whole movie worthwhile, but don't look for the ""James Bond"" type of suspence and thrill, you won't get it..."
3,Neither drama nor comedy,"The problem with this movie is that it seems that Shepard, who directed it, could never decide whether he wanted to make a drama or a comedy. For a true drama, it lack the depth of characters and real dramatic tension, like say Leon has. For a comedy, it is not really that funny, like for example Nine and a Half Yards. It also drags, and 90 minutes seem to last an awful long while watching it. All said, I am glad I watched at least for the great acting by the 2.5 lead actors, especially Brosnan. The movie is worth watching just for that, I think."
1,You've Got To Be Kidding!,"Besides the ""thrill"" of seeing Pierce Brosnan in a role unlike his previous, this was the worst piece of trash I have ever seen. The plot was ludicrous and contrived, the comedy was forced, the viewer couldn't care less about the outcome. One five second entertaining reprieve from the drollness of this catastrophe was watching Pierce's lip quivering while he was crying. Wow, so funny. The comedy in this movie was neither intelligent not slapstick and totally lacking in depth."
2,Crap,There is actually nothing good about this film...and the bonding between the two leading men bothers me greatly.stupid stupid film
1,Does not work with XBOX 360 HD DVD Player,"Just rented this from Netflix. Does not play on Xbox 360 HD DVD player.After Googling, found out that Clerks 2 (Another Weinstein Brothers release) also does not play on Xbox HD DVD player.Xbox 360 owners beware of all Weinstein Brother's HD DVD releases."
3,"A sleazy remake of ""Real Men"" (1987)","Looks like Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) an out of work salesman is making a come back in Mexico City. He is celebrating at the bar. Julian Noble (Pierce Brosnan) is also in Mexico City to make a killing. It is Julian's birthday and he too goes to the bar to celebrate. Naturally the too shall meet. After a shaky greeting they exchange job information and become friends.The question is where does this friendship lead and what do we learn form it?""The title comes from a scene at a bullfight which is used as a metaphor.The story can be scene again in essence in the movie ""Real Men"" (1987) which contains a little S&M; but not as sleazy as this version.."
4,A killer who loses his touch,"Julian Noble (Pierce Brosnan) plays an oversexed assassin with no friends, until he meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear), a salesman who is down on his luck in Mexico. Danny is struggling to keep his job and life together when he meets Julian, and despite the hit man's self centered lifestyle, he finds he likes the salesman. When Julian suffers a breakdown and can't hit his targets anymore, he realizes Danny Wright is the only friend he has in the world and may be the only one who can help. Can an ordinary salesman save a hitman's life?Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
3,"Good movie, DVD ticks me off","Good movie for the same reasons stated in the other reviews, a good quirky humor movie.The DVD on the other hand has one of the things I hate most, unskippable commercials. So yes, even though you payed $15 to own the movie, every time you play it not only will you have to skip over the usual other new release ads, you'll have to sit through commercials you CAN'T skip. That's not what I paid $15 for. And these brain dead publishers wonder why things get taken off the internet instead... maybe because those don't come with commercials.T."
4,Amusing movie with a great performance by Brosnan,The Bottom Line:Pierce Brosnan plays a thoroughly-enjoyable character (a gone-to-seed hitman with no ability to relate to people whatsoever whose analogies all reference prostitutes) the likes of whom I've never seen before in a film--the fact that the filmmakers surround him with an interesting cast and situations is just gravy.3/4
4,Colorful backdrop of Mexico city shines on Blu-Ray,"About 50% of this film takes place and was shot on location in Mexico city.Similar to the other documentary movie, by the same title, this backdrop, and analogous hit-man title, lends itself to the pageantry of the bull fight.The colors of Mexico city and the Camino Real hotel really pop on Blu Ray, and just gives you a sense of being in Mexico city.Otherwise, the topic is somewhat comical, as the hit man finds his only friend in the perfect stranger he meets in the the hotel bar. Overall a decent buddy movie."
4,Hilarious,"This movie is truely enjoyable, I sat through the whole thing and was pleased with what was given. Any fan of Pierce Brosnan will probably love this movie."
3,James Bond at 40,"Low key comedy with amusing bits, but not laugh-out loud funny. The acting was superb, but the pace was slow as molasses. I saw this movie as James Bond with a mid-life crisis. What happens when James Bond is old and instead of being suave and handsome, comes across as a drunk, dirty old man, friendless, without family, and unable to do his job?This is an inside joke, like Marlon Brando playing Don Corleone in the ""Freshman."" Pierce Brosnan is playing James Bond, but there are no super villians, only himself looking inwards."
2,Never gets off the ground,"I rented this movie not knowing what to expect. With two very good actors I figured it shouldn't be a waste of time and it wasn't. But it was slow moving in parts, Pierce Brosnan's character is a quirky lounge lizard that happens to be an assasin and it was hard to picture (accept?) Brosnan in that roll. It is a 180 degree departure from his Bond character and when you think of Bond these days, tag he's it. Greg Kinnear is solid as usual although his character just seems to tag along for the ride. Not a bad movie but certainly not great by any stretch. My recommendation is to rent it, don't buy it because after you see it once you most likely won't be popping it back into the DVD player any time soon. **BnB Beatles Depot**"
3,Being an assassin is a lonely business.,"This is another so-so movie. Worth watching but not great. Certainly worth a rent though. I was buying lots of movies on sale but to many aren't worth owning. Most of my 3 star movies fall into that category, worth seeing but don't really want to own."
2,Pity for Pierce Brosnan,I could not stand the comedy of Brosnan and the dullness of the film. Sorry about the recent James Bond after such successful 007 films.
3,Doing the job-study for which it was purchased.,I purchased this book for a short-term Bible study and it is filling theneed of having my own copy of the book for the study.
2,dated definitions demean this dictionary,"I had hoped the recent publication date meant this dictionary would be a handy and useful tool. As a check, I referred to words used in my professional activity (gerontology). What I found was distressing. Some of the defintions are not only inaccurate, but perpetuate harmful and dated sterotypes. (e.g, dementia). I am returning this book and would not recommend it to anyone looking for an aid to current usage"
2,its ok,I mean dont get me wrong or anything the watch is really cute but everytime you set the correct time it never tells the right time so my recommmendation is get a watch form your local store save your money !!
2,Overrated interpretation/performance,"I found Previn's ""Rhapsody"" a grave disappointment.The orchestra, particularly the brass, is sloppy and frequently downright inappropriate-- bombastic percussion, weak horns, and so on. As for interpretation, from beginning to finish Previn-- both as conductor and as pianist-- seems perpetually rushed, as though Gershwin's music were merely a means to a higher end. I found this interpretation devoid of profundity in any emotional realm; thoroughly un-groovin' and un-movin'. Don't bother."
4,"Short, Simple And Straight To The Point","The book is a little bit old (1999) but nevertheless it offers good advice in a easy to read, simple and concise way. It addresses five main areas: People - Hiring The Best and Keeping Them, Doing Business On The Web, New Products, Not-So-New Products and The Partners You May Not Think Of As Partners (Coworkers, Service Agencies, Dealers, the Press). My favorite books about Microsoft are still ""Microsoft Secrets"" from a management point of view and ""Hard Code"" by Eric Brechner from a software engineering perspective."
5,Simply fantastic -- and refreshingly free of B.S.,"Julie Bick takes real-world examples and scenarios, and describes the sound logic and cutting edge techniques necessary to operate a successful, ""malleable"" business in a modern, fast-changing global environment. Rather than rehashing buzz-words and catch-phrases, Julie shows how brilliant and innovative managers have used these specific techniques to ""create their own luck."" The book is also up-to-date enough to include modern, actionable internet strategies. And the level of detail in the book includes not just macro-management, but tweaking as well. Most people ""learn by doing,"" so I find most management textbooks relate only amorphous, diluted, tired concepts. With Ms. Bick, rubber hits the road.My only criticism is that Ms. Bick's literary career is keeping her from using her acumen to help my own business."
3,"Disappointing after having read ""Microsoft Secrets""","This book doesn't have the analytical sharpness of ""Microsoft Secrets"". To me it seemed like a collection of more or less related anecdotes/interviews.Lots of the advice is not Microsoft sepecific e.g. ""Be Nice, Even When They're Not in the Room"""
1,POOR PRODUCT.,"This is a poor, low quality knock off of the original product. Nothing more than alcohol and water and a little brand unknown fragrance. The product I used in the 1960's was made by Swank and was a very powerful distinctive fragrance. I am disappointed. I loved Jade East Cologne and would purchase it gladly if it were available made by Swank."
1,Very Disappointed,"I don't have a problem with the seller as I do with the product, I am very disappointed to say the least that anyone would market this aftershave and try to pass it off as Jade East!I can save someone a few dollars, this is mostly alcohol with a slight and I am being generous when I say slight fragrance of anything. If you remember Jade East, how it smelled...this is as far as the east is from the west in comparison.Nothing like the original! If only they would market that again!"
4,Still Around,I use to use Jade East many years ago when it first came on the market. I always liked it but lost track of it over time. I happen to see on Amazon so purchased the aftershave. It sure brought back old memories. Glad I found it as I still enjoy the scent.
5,Just as Described,Product was just the same quality as I remember buying it years ago. Good service from vendor. Will buy from this vendor again.
1,Van Halen- Bottoms up,"It sucks!! Seller states that it was recorded in 1983, Sammy Hagar was not in the band at that time. I am an early VH fan (DLR era) and this dvd is not from that era. Early VH fans stay away. I am going to use the DVD as a coaster."
1,DESCRIPTION IS A LIE!,"The description states this was recorded in 1983, which would lead one to think it was the classic Van Halen with David Lee Roth. Imagine how surprised I was when I flipped the case over, saw a picture of Sammy Hagar, and the song list from tours with Hagar!I am going to destroy this item so I can spare someone else from the same pain...at least it will be one less in circulation."
4,really?,Too bad we can't get a serious review of the audio / video quality.. Just whining about Sammy. Grow up. thank you.
1,Got me worried.... but without cause.,"If you are interested in one woman's personal opinion, feel free to read this book. But if you are looking for actual medical facts regarding a woman's health, supported by scientific studies; you won't find any here.Dr. Rako makes a lot of claims in this book, but doesn't have anything to back up those claims. Her reasoning seems to be, ""periods are NATURAL and a part of woman's FEMINITY, so choosing not to have them is BAD.""At least she admits in the first chapter that many well-educated medical professionals DISAGREE with her personal opinion."
1,Pseudo-Science at Its Best,"This book is a stunning example of the absolute and total mangling and distortion of science. It should be categorized under ""faith"" rather than gynecology or science."
1,"Look elsewhere for unbiased, researched information","This book was, quite frankly, offensive. From the start, Dr. Radko makes it clear she is against the birth control pill for any usage, not just menstrual suppression. This slim book was filled with biased, unclear information, including several pages of ""quotes"" from unnamed women supposedly taken from an unnamed website asking people if they would like to have ""no more periods"". Not a recommended read if you are looking for thoughtful, carefully researched advice. Call your doc or go to the library and search for some recent articles."
3,It's ok,"The costume clothing isn't anything better than you would buy packaged at a discount store, it is packaged the same way. The most disappointing part of it was the wig. It took a lot of work to make it lay right and even then it didn't stay. Plus it was thin in spots so it wasn't balanced on his head.It's fine for a kids halloween but only if you get a good price or don't expect too much."
5,Great for lefties!,I bought these for my mom who always finds it awkward when cooking to use regular measuring cups & she loves them & since they're designed for use by either lefties or righties we only have to have one set of cups in the kitchen
4,Some great funky moments!,"In this album, Nino explores the vast & fruitful funk/rock-fusion territory from a dark, psychedelic, sometimes fierce point of view. A suicide victim himself, Nino showcases his extreme *politically-incorrect* attitude, urging french youth to test drugs, or singing about haschisch dreams. Most interesting stuff throughout, with the collaboration of cult-organist Bernard Estardy."
2,Replacement product does not suit,"My Mom who is 92 was very pleased with the Depend product we had ordered.When it was discontinued we tried the Prevail product. It did not fit or feel as supportive as the Depend product she had been using.She has requested that we not continue with the Prevail product.Reasons: The stretch in the panty is not as supportive as the depend product. She feels more secure in the Depend Product.Why did you discontinue the Depend product?S/M Extra Absorbency PlusPrevail Protective Underwear, Super Absorbency, Small/Medium, 18 Underwear (Pack of 4)"
4,The American Ephemeris for the 21st century 2000-2050 at Mid,"i am not speak english, i am astrology."
4,ephemeris,I had someone show me how to use these but I still need to learn more! Never stop learning.
2,The American Ephemeris for the 21st Century 2000 - 2050,Product came BEFORE promised and in excellent condition.
3,necessary reference,This is a necessary reference book for all astrologers. Unfortunately it is very badly bound and falls apart easily.
1,nothing concrete,"I was forced to buy and read this book as a course requirement. I feel that my time and money could have been spent in a far more productive way. The majority of this book revolves around the author's speculations; speculations about past research, speculations about other peoples speculations, speculations about the authors own speculations from the first edition, and so on. There wasn't enough concrete knowledge included in this book to hold my attention"
5,"Overwhelming story, finely crafted","The Shackleton story is amazing, but this accounting of it is stunningly thought through and executed. Read it over and over."
2,Drug Dealers story,"I must admit when I first purchase the book I was very disappointed after only reading a couple of pages. I read reviews that compared this book to b-more cafeful and the coldest winter ever, but this book is no where near as entertaining or well written as those two books. But hey I figured since I already spent my 10 bucks , that I might as well read it. Once I got over the disappointment that it wasn't another coldest winter ever, I'm able to say the book is ok. Would I recommend it, no. One thing that confused me is that he claims to know Foxy, Nas, and Noreaga. But if this book was written in the late 80's earlier 90's that would make foxy around 9 years old and Nas 15. I'm just not buying it."
3,too superficial,This book is entertaining. However if you are expecting a masterpiece do not get your hopes up high. To sum this up in one word : superficial. This book unfortunately lacks depth. The author shows much promise but I only wish he went deeper into the main character. This book was devoid of detailed information. Actually this book was devoid of words period as it can be read in under 2 hours by someone who reads at an average speed. The plot and everything else was very typical and predictable.
1,Mob-less Story,"This book really displayed a first time writer story line, complete with typos. I am an avid reader of books that cover a broad spetrum of topics and was very disapponited by this book. I do think it had great potential to evolve into a book that would leave you wanting more but it all did was make me want to hurry up and finish."
1,What A Waste of Paper,Are you kidding me? This book was HORRIBLE! Every other word was a typo. The story was old and weak. I definitely could not recommend this. Movie? I don't think so.
5,Awakening Wisdom from Innocence,"The author starts with innocence & children & incorporates that with a virtual insightfulness into wisdom. Based on experiences, discoveries, love & spirituality, while merging facts, she gives the reader much to ponder. Bringing courage, the absence of fear, & a refreshing look at addressing problems may enable the reader to find the empowerment to change his/her life."
3,"FAR FROM GINO'S BEST WORK, HOWEVER...","... one of Gino's greatest compositions is on this disc - a gorgeous mid-tempo number called ""Sunset On L.A."", which stands out like a neon Xmas tree in comparison to the weaker material on this album. An incredible oversight on the part of AM radio why this tune never got any airplay!"
1,colors not true,colors shown on jasco online are not true to what you get. customer service is horrible.
3,Wrong color,"I asked for ""chocolate"" got powder blue. Nice product, but not what I wanted. No response from seller as to my email report of color mixup yet."
1,Sad,"The author becomes dissatisfied with life and finds salvation in becoming Catholic, finding some straight buddies to butch him up, and repressing his sexuality.I first read this book years ago when I still believed in the tripe fed me by ""loving"" Christians about the abnormality of my sexual orientation. I even wrote Morrison once and his advice to me: ""Behave yourself."" Today I know better.The church continues to harshly and cruelly denounce gay people, and antigay bullying and suicide makes headlines. How sad. David Morrison is wrong and so is his church."
1,Dangerous book,"This book is a great way to make LGBT teens feel worthless and depressed. As a recovering gay Catholic, I remember youth group meetings on homosexuality, and how gays area called to ""live a chaste life"" and that gay marriage is terrible, evil, etc. But of course they are to be loved as brothers and sisters in Christ! This kind of doublespeak has caused so much anxiety in my life, and as a teenager, made me incredibly depressed. Being gay, knowing it can't change, but having to hide it and have to live alone forever to fit in with your faith.. that's awful, and this book simply makes it more awful, because it's written by a self-hating gay. It makes me sad that he wrote this book and makes me sad that anyone would read it."
5,Trying to stand in a fallen world,David Morrison presents a compelling story of his journey into and through homosexuality. This book is an excellent resource for anyone interested in this hot cultural issue. Morrisons writing is engaging and thoughtful. His conclusions are faithful to church teaching and to his own conscience.
3,Informative,It is a very straightforward biography with a very important theological message as its theme. The message gives hope to the hopeless. It's not the most interesting presentation- it kind of reads like the stories they read on NPR- so it may not be the best book to start with. I still give this book my recommendadion- it is informative and a must-read (but not a first-read) for anyone who is dealing with Homosexuality in their life or has an acquaintance who is struggling with it.
5,One Great Book,"What a great book! I have recommended it and given it to people over the years and they all have loved it. I felt the claustrophobia of being alone, the fear of what happened to a loved one, the companionship of a dog and the resentfulness of the intrusions. This needs to be read in the heart of winter during a cold spell. Along the same lines I recommend ""The Last Season"" by James Morgenson."
3,"Overall good, but not the best","I would recommend this book to a friend, but if you are actually looking for a modern Walden, this is not where to look. This book isn't a philosophy book. Its a great story about how living in the wilderness can change a person. The ending left me somewhat unsatisfied, but after all, it is a true story."
3,"Interesting at times, but overall a mundane read","Overall, I was disappointed with this book after finishing it. While it does have it's high points, the page turning sections are few and far between. The rest of the book is filled with fairly boring and mundane details of the authors time spent living in the wilderness. It certainly did not live up to my expectations that were set by the other reviewers."
5,moving stories in honest prose,"The title story is a moving story about a father and son, about loss and human frailty. The stories delineate failing marriages and lost souls, treading somewhat in Carver Country. I'm now reading his memoir, Indian Creek Chronicles, and it is a pleasure to read. I consider him frist rate and a find."
2,"Less about wilderness and more of a ""coming of age"" book...","First of all, it is not accurate to claim that the author spent 7 months in the wilderness alone. True; he spent long stretches--rarely more than a month, and often less than that-- alone. But he dwells on this human interaction more than on nature. Also, this is poor writing. There are no beatiful images of nature created through metaphor or simile; no philisophical or metaphysical discoveries made during his experiences. If your looking for books about wilderness or adventure keep looking. However, if you are a young teen then you may enjoy the immature writing style, and you may think this an adventure."
5,"""Indian Creek Chronicles""","Refreshing and engaging first-person account of coming-of-age from a wise young man alone in the wilderness. I've found it personally inspiring as a, well, middle-aged woman, and continue to pass along copies to young people I know -- not because it's preachy or anything (it's not), but Fromm is the sort of buddy a mom would be happy to see her college kid bring home for a weekend: self-reliant, reflective, modest, polite, resourceful, and a good sport. Don't worry: It's a Man's Man's book (my manly husband likes it and recommends it, too). That Fromm happens to be a naturally good writer, too, is a plus. It's gotten awards, so you don't have to take my word on that."
1,I don't know what to say.,"Not a game. It's not a game. A wreaky combo system that rips off another cool game? WRETCHED GRAPHICS. Cheap moves. Idiotic music. GAHHHHHHH!!!!!!! I can't quite figure out why it's in the game section. How about, put it in the, I barfed upon a floppy disk and called it a N64 title. 63 1/3?! Is that supposed to be funny?! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! NotTT!! If you got the game's best moments. It's best animations, it's best characters. It's best moves, and the best everything! And put it together. It would be an ABU diaper. Please, and I mean, PLEASE!!!! Don't EVER and I mean EVER waste your money on this game. Please, I beg of you.I would rather play peekaboo in a kid's playhouse than play this. Do not save this for rainy days, do not save it for any days. Destroy this, burn it. Break open the disgusting plastic cartrige and then pull out the belt sander on the memory chip. Then take the ashes and spit them to non existence......... That's all....."
5,Awsome game!,This is one of my favorite games of all times. I like all of the players and how they're made out of clay right in front oof your eyes. If you like fighting games I think you will like this!
5,I'm never reading Gamespot Review again!,"I read the other reports,so I was a little unenthusiastic about ordering this game.When I got it,I was shocked!Great graphics,great sound,great attacks, and excellent characters!The control is a little hard,but once you get the hang of it,its fine!Excellent game!"
4,inaccurate,"I can't comment on how good this cd set is because I haven't heard it. I only gave it 4 stars because I had to pick a rating.The only song I know is Ro Ro Keda by Zarsanga. I don't know why it is on this compilation, because as far as I know it is not an Indian song, but rather a traditional Pashto song from Afghanistan."
3,Not a fan myself. You might like it.,"It tastes a bit too artificial for my liking - the fizziness doesn't help either. Others may like this, but I doubt I'll finish my little tin anytime soon. :)Also leaves an aftertaste, as coke does."
3,Down - Rock - Gothic,"This cd is in the style of Vision Thingof the sisters of mercy , mixedwith hopeless darkness of joy divisionespecially the last song makes this recordworth buying , the circle will be close."
4,Good and useful,"I liked this book: it tells the essential without using incomprehensible mathematical language. If we want, anyway, to find a lack, it sometimes repeats, in my opinion, things likely known to whom takes in his hand a book of numerical computation. It could focus a little more its attention to the way to build the solving matrix."
2,Not quite.....,"My overall impression is that this book is really three treatments for three different books, or perhaps three short stories extended and patched together. While these three plots might have meshed together nicely in some other writer's hands, they did not in this case. Instead we get a grinding of gears and, ultimately, a transmission failure no specialist could fix.Rarely will I abandon a book 75 pages before it is finished, but this one I did. I didn't even sneak a peek to see how it ended."
3,"Big Ideas, but not very well executed","Some nice hard-SF concepts, but not as well worked-out as I know Benford can do. There's a succession of twists, but they don't have as much impact as they could - and a startling turn near the very end, but it isn't well explained. This book is about the SF concepts - think Hal Clement - but the dialog and characters aren't up to Hal Clement, much less other hard-SF writers."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"A somewhat breezy novel, it seems. Perhaps very accessible. Complete with some diagrams, which was a nice touch. Certainly not as intense as The Martian Race, being a sequel with a more technologically advanced group of humans.Very interesting bunch of life forms they come across, eventually tying back in to the first novel.Not sure the ship captain needed to be Axelrod's daughter - maybe there is an in-joke here, does Benford have a female descendant?"
1,Scanner conflicts with digital camera,"Ever since I hooked up the scanner, I've been unable to download pictures from my Canon S40 digital camera. If I unplug the scanner cable, the camera starts working again. I made sure I had the latest driver for both devices and then called customer support.Customer support said there is nothing they can do. They claim Windows XP does not allow a scanner and a camera to be connected at the same time (yeah, like nobody has ever done this before). When I mentioned to the tech that an older Visioneer (USB) scanner and the same camera worked together just fine, he said ""Wow, that's weird""! When I started to talk about a refund on the product, I was disconnected."
1,Lack of control,"Lacks the size and quality control of the Epson Perfection series as well as other scanner models. Also, the copy function is black and white only. Every other scanner I have owned (including Epson and HP) is capable of direct color copies and I was very disappointed that this one only copied black and white. You can scan in color to the OCR, but the OCR decided I didn't have a printer despite the fact that my printer was in it's list of possible choices. The scanner worked fine directly with the printer, but I needed to make color copies and this product wouldn't do it (surprising considering my other scanners cost far less and could do so much more), so I returned this frustrating product."
1,Visioneer 9320 - Send it back to Alpha testing.,Review Visioneer 9320:+ The side open covers is a nice feature.- The user guide is not up to date for the current release - 8.x.- The software installation aborted and required an extensive search of the Visioneer web site to locate utilities to remove Registry entries.- The 35mm Negative scan terminates at high (>4800) resolution.- The 9320 is available for $25< @ competitive outlets.- No configuration option to keep the Scan Monitor from loading at Start-Up.Summary: Don't waste your time or money here.
1,worthless color and decent b&w,"Three words: Bad color scans. I have gone through customer service purgatory with special registry cleaners to install ""new"" drivers and still the color scans have red streaks and faded, blurry colors. Basically, the unit is DOA for any color scanning.Works great as a b&w; document scanning device. Did I mention that I am into color photography?Bottom line: I'm getting a new scanner."
2,Its not locked damnit,This scanner worked extremely well for about a year (interesting that's when the warrenty craps out). I then get the Lock error refered to above. It appears that the main bulb is burned out. I was acctually pertty impressed with there tech support. I got hold of a real person in less than 30 seconds. They offered to send be a new one If I could prove I bought it in the last year.Sigh
2,"When it Works, It's Works; When it Dosen't.....","I bought this scanner almost a year ago with a new computer. The person who installed it (someone who worked in a computer repair store for 10+ years), had a hard time getting it to work properly at first. When it was working, I was able to scan just about anyghing with no problem and decent quality. Color and B&W; pictures came out decent, although the white tended to have a pale blue tinge to it. If used for B&W; text, I had to increase the resolution in order to have unbroken italic writing.My main problem is that I had kept getting a TWAIN device error which forced me to either restart the program, computer, or reinstall the software on several occasions. The last straw was yesterday when I reinstalled the software TWICE TO THE EXACT LETTER of the provided instructions, and the instrument refused to work AT ALL.In conclusion, I suggest getting another scanner, like I'm going to do this weekend."
3,Bruce Springsteen - Under The Influence,"Under the Influence examines the foundations of Springsteen's craft and illustrates the huge influence that artists such as these have had on him throughout his career. This superb program also looks broadly at the political, literary and cultural influences that have affected New Jersey's favorite son, and all at once provides the most detailed and fascinating film ever made about Springsteen's inspiration. Featuring rare footage of Bruce and all of his favorites, alongside revealing archive interviews with The Boss himself, and insightful contributions from Vini Lopez and Gary Mallaber (ex of the E Street Band), Gary (US) Bonds, biographer Eric Alterman, Rolling Stone's Anthony De Curtis and numerous other associates, experts and influences. This film is both a detailed, academic look at Bruce Springsteen's artistic development and an entertaining and joyous celebration of his own music and that of the artists he loved most."
3,The same as French Revolution from the History Channel,"After a lot of searching for videos on the French Revolution, there were two that I found from the History Channel. Each had different stock numbers so I though they were two different documentaries- WRONG...they are exactly the same, regardless of the different titles. The only difference is the added bonus in the Instant Expert Version which includes some questions with answers and a little trivia. Buyer beware- only get one or the other."
2,"Overdone, boring","We watched this as a family, with a 10yo and 13yo who know a reasonable amount about about the French Revolution. We weren't surprised to find sex and blood, but it was rather overdone. We had to fast forward past a few spots, which we expected, but overall, none of us were engaged and we didn't learn anything new that we can remember. In fact, all four of us felt a little dirty at the end, mostly because we all thought we'd wasted our time.The pacing was slow, the shots were repeated over and over, and what ""acting"" there was seemed self-conscious. For example, the blood dripping from the basket under the guillotine was maybe moderately effective the first couple of times, but then became just annoying. It grossed out my kids, and didn't add to the meaning or feeling of horror because of its overuse.I know that any French Revolution video worth its salt must contain ickiness to be real, but this one tried too hard and failed miserably at our house."
5,Westlake Strikes Again,"Fans of Donald E. Westlake are sure to enjoy this classic caper published under a one-time pseudonym.If you enjoyed Dancing Aztecs and Castle in the Air, you will thrill to this romp through the world of Westlake. Engaging and funny throughout."
5,One of Roy's best,"Great DVD, solid in every way. Lots of action. This isone of Roy's best movies, you'll love it."
1,Limp bizkit is tottally phat dude!,"HEY, I LOVE DA BOYS OF LIMP BIZKIT! FRED IS SO HOT! AND WES IS SOOO TALENTED. NOOKIE IS THE BEST SONG CREATED, AND METHOD MAN IS DA MAN! I LOVE LIMP, THEY R BETTER THAT RAGE, KORN OR KID ROCK! THEY R THE BESTEST BAND OF ALL TIME!P.S. justing giving a shoutout to all the knuckleheads who like this kinda rap-metal trash"
5,Awesome CD!,"To be honest, the first time I listened to this CD, I was kinda dissapointed. But after listening to it a few more times, I realized how awesome this CD is. The only songs I don't really like, (excluding the Intro and the Outro) are ""No Sex"" and ""A Lesson Learned"". That leaves 11 awesome songs. My favorites are ""Break Stuff"", ""Nookie"", and ""Don't Go Off Wandering"". From the Heavy beats of ""Break Stuff"" to the rap based""N 2 gether Now"", this CD has something for everyone, and in my belief is far better than their debut. This CD has definately earned a spot in my favorite CDs category."
5,Great phone,"I've had this cell phone for 2 days and it is great. Text messaging, phone calls, and the camera work fine. The image on the screen is high quality. Overall, it works great."
1,Just wasn't good enough,"The characters were poorly written, and Simone never spends enough time or thought with any other character to make it believeable or to make us care. (including her husband, as they fall instantly in love, they move away, he gets shot.) I've read other books with quick pacing, but here everything is just too convienient, there is no real struggle, and I couldn't believe any of it.There are also weird devices like her grandmother having spirits of her past (dead) loves hiding in her armpit, cleavage ect. who talk to her, or sing loudly and distract her thoughts. What was that about? I found it extremely annoying and distracting.It was ultimately a dissapointment, because the setting deserved a better story. Can't say I'll be looking for any more of Ms. Mossanen's work."
5,you get what you pay for...quality,"This sprinkler costs more, but well worth it. I bought 2 brand new sprinklers this year. Both metal editions for $20 & $25. Both wore out and broke in short time. This tractor keeps on truckin. I do wish it had the automatic shut-off. Some of the similar ones had a ramp it drives up on when it reaches the end of the hose and shuts the sprinkler off. That would be nice. I bought this one because it was the heaviest."
5,Walking sprinkler,I live in south Texas and we are in an extreme drought. The junk plastic sprinklers are just that; JUNK. The plastic gears stripped out after about ten uses. They also cost about $100. I use the new Rittenhouse sprinkler every day and it performs like magic. Made like they used to make stuff years ago. This will be the last sprinkler you will ever have to buy and is made in the U.S.A>
5,Walking cast Iron sprinkler,"Ive been wanting one of these for so long, I looked at the cheaper built ones, all or part plastic and doomed to break after the first one of two seasons of use. I bought this one and have used it several times due to our drought situation down here in the south. This sprinkler is awesome. I lay out the hose in the morning and turn it on. You set the amount of water you want to put out and it does the rest. My yard is pretty and green now. The sprinkler is well built, solid metal with replaceable parts. Just remember to pick it up by the handle and not by the sprinkler bars. Its very heavy and not apt to be knocked over by any animals or children. Best of all its Made in the USA.Walking Sprinkler - Cast Iron"
4,Culture Shock,"Great band, great album. 4WF, Butterglove, Kenmores, Breadwinner, & The Alternatives should have put Richmond on the map. Giving this album a listen almost makes me miss RVA. Good job Taylor, glad to see ya'll on Amazon."
5,Follow your dreams,"A great story for children of all ages. Teachers could use this book when studying the Plains Indians, Geography of the Plains States or wildflowers. When children know a legend associated with a plant they will retain the knowledge of that plant longer."
3,Damaged when arrived,When I got this book it had a lot of water damage for some reason. Doesn't bother me too much since I used it for one lesson I needed it for. Being new though I would have expected better.
2,STARR & 200+ stretches for the table,"I'm a massage therapist and a former teacher. I have a difficult time enjoying either dvd because there are too many ""ummm's"" and very few benefits of the shown proceedures are discussed. He's very intelligent and gives a wealth of knowledge if you are able to follow his thought process. Definitely not a professionally made dvd or a professional instructor. This should have been a buy one get one free deal."
2,Staar Techniques Sports Massage,"The lighting in this video isn't very professional. He will be talking & you can't see the image because the camera is on the wrong side of the body. I also found the model to be highly unprofessional, she had a tattoo that I found distracting. Sometimes the vocal level was recorded low, there were times I couldn't understand what he was saying."
1,Trigger Point Nothing....,"This by far is THE WORST DVD on the market. I could only sit through 15 minutes before I shut it off. The information is poorly presented, and he rarely even talks about trigger points. My 8 year old could have done better then he did. Don't waste your time on this, it is not worth the money at all!"
2,None as expected.,"There's a LONG DVD movie, without posibility of searching the diferent chapters. You need to watch all the movie if you want to look for what you need. The explanations are poor and I am not satisfied with the product, as I expected."
4,DVD delivers what it claims,"The studio used to create this video is very basic and the presentation will not win any awards, but it delivers the claim, 100+ massage chair techniques. There are brief explanations of setup, takedown and some business tips. The remainder of the video demonstrates various techniques for chair massage. The individual who demonstrates and narrates the techniques is very informative.I am a massage therapy student who has yet to take the chair classes. I just bought a massage chair; this video offers enough to give me the head start I hoped for. I believe the price to purchase this DVD was very fair."
5,Great Stretching Techniques,"I loved the stretching techniques! There are many stretching techniques I have not seen before and I have incorporated them into my sports massage routine. I haven't mastered all of them, but it's a work in progress. Most of the stretching techniques explain what muscles are being stretched, but not all of them (most of them are self-explanatory). I would recommend this video to anybody who is interested in learning how to stretch a client!!!"
5,Younger Days,"I was overseas and in high school when this came out. Ever since then I have kept an eye out for it and scored 1 about 25 years ago for $5.00 and have it still. A more fantastic debut album I don't believe there has ever been. I am also a big Jackson Browne fan and these two traveled together when they were starting out but I believe Jimmie would have been a bigger draw had he lived. Excellent album. Belton,Missouri"
3,"A special treat, from an Era full of them.","Just acquired this one on CD. It's albums like this that make the early 70's my clear favorite as far as era's in music are concerned.Not only are Jimmie's vocals superb, but please play this one loud so you can hear every nuance contained in the music.Beautiful sounds and clarity throughout!It is a shame that music such as this is so difficult to obtain.Hopefully that will change in the near future.(Meant to hit 4 Stars on this one)"
2,Isle of View,"I first heard Jimmie in 1977 and Isle of View was just magical to me. He truly is one of the best artist that most people will never hear about, and his legend continues and always will. On Jackson Browne's CD Looking East, he mentions Jimmie in 'Barricades of heaven'. It's a great song, so check it out."
5,A beautiful treasure of harmony and lyrics.....,"This album spread through my fraternity house like wildfire in the early 1970's.....one person would hear it and go out and get the album that same afternoon, and then they would play it for someone else and the pattern would repeat.At one point during that time this was the BEST selling album at a record chain with stores in Norman, OK (home of Oklahoma University)....and Austin, TX (home of The University of Texas). It appealed then - and still does today - to anyone who liked soaring vocal harmony and thoughtful lyrics that seemed to speak directly to the listener. It captivated EVERY set of ears that had the pleasure to listen to it.... you are considering getting this album, you should ...I have never heard anyone have anything except extreme praise for this album. A classic album that will be the cornerstone of your collection from the moment you receive it.What a talent this man had....."
4,spiritual rock,"Spheeris's Isle of View is a classic CD, full of mellow songs that put you at ease. They don't sell many of his CD's at local record stores, so finding it on Amazon was a great suprise and. This CD is perfect for long car rides, while reading a book, or doing just about anything. If you want some simple tunes, that bring a good message and are relaxing, this is the CD for you."
4,"Ending a bit rushed, but getting there was lots of fun (3.5 stars)","I love sweet romances about ministers who act like men, not monks. I adored the real-life, small town setting, and the characters were very real and full of fun. I liked that Abbie didn't have to be a Stepford-like ""church wife"" for Seth, and that even though he didn't ask her to change, she didn't end up changing who she was to please him, that they could both take joy in each other just the way God Himself made them. Just because someone isn't as religious doesn't make them any less spiritual, though Abbie will be going to church more often anyway, just as if Seth were a baseball player, she would be going to see him play. The so-called ""black moment"" in romantic fiction lasted about a page, and really wasn't much of a conflict, but this was a lighthearted romance, and such a minor sin is forgivable because a story, like life, is not always about the destination, but also the journey."
2,Where's the tunes?,I bought this DVD looking forward to hearing the songs in it but alas no music. Even the Gypsy scene was cut short and no music. This is supposed to be the authorized version by the Roy Rogers Estate and there's no music? Very disappointing. What a waste of money.
2,Superman not a supertoy,"My 4yr old wasnt that thrilled after a couple of hours playing with this (and the Green Lantern figure I bought). Why? Because this Superman...1. Is so stiff, it doesnt bend at the elbows and knees2. Feels like the glued hard-rubber cape might fall off3. Gets ""bald"" as the paint on its head and boots gets easily scratched away when it hits other toys4. Is top-heavy and has a hard time standing on its ownSadly, I think that its only redeeming factor is its very good likeness to the cartoon. Little kids tend to play rough, specially when superheroes battle it out with supervillains. Perhaps this toy was meant to be displayed only, and not actively played by little hands?"
4,Charlie's Angels,"If you are a Charlie's Angels, or Zena wannabe, this book is for you! Alternately funny and serious."
2,Kind of Silly!!!,"I guess I thought that this book would have information about how to train and prepare for a variety of circumstances and eat right and get fit but it had more information about things like dressing sexy to capture a man's attention or making a man be your ""slave"" by treating him like crap and keeping him ""coming back for more"" and other silly things like that, which I am not really interested in."
1,Extremely unhelpful,"I bought this book, hoping to learn something new about communication skills, what I found was a list of common sense every day advises, which I'm sure everyone is familiar with, this book did not help me at all, it would probably help someone who came out of jungle, for this book is as basic as they come."
2,Is this a book or a PowerPoint presentation?,"This is closer to a set of PowerPoint slides than it is to a real book. Most of what it says is reasonable, but it doesn't say enough to be worth buying.One piece of advice they give is to use anecdotes and stories, but they don't come close to following that advice. It's rare for them to put more than two sentences together into something paragraph-like.I'm not sure who this book is aimed at, but their advice to ""avoid questions that pry into personal matters"" implies their goals have little to do with what I wanted advice about (creating close personal friendships).The one good aspect of the book is that it won't take much of your time - if you spend more than an hour reading it, you're doing something wrong."
4,a very good story for the period,Very good movie with a very good story for the period on DVD I believe this is the uncut version. She goes wild around the beautiful countryside on her Harley Davidson motorbike. Freedom come to life although I feel all she wants is to be loved.
5,bathing cloths,These are excellent to refresh during long road trip or to keep (as we do) at our mountain cabin for times when storms hit and power and water goes out.
2,Awful!,Misguided and unstylish performances. Violinist uses way too much vibrato; trills started on the wrong note. Best to leave the Bach sonatas to folks who know what they are doing like Rachel Podger or Fabio Biondi.Not recommended!
2,Not so hot,"I purchased this CD after hearing one of his songs on internet radio. There are only two good songs on this CD. I appreciate the intros, because he is really trying to reach people. As far as the music goes, not so good."
3,Breathtakingly beautifull Lorrie,"This was the first album fom Lorrie Morgan,when a friend gave it to me as a christmas gift. I really didn't know anything about this performer,and i'm not a fan of country music,but was i surprised by this album! The titlesong 'Something in red' is wonderfull as also the rest of this album,worth listening to on a rainy day,i also encourage others to give this album as a gift,or for no reason at all,it's just a great album.from ALTEREGO in Tulsa OK"
2,Book Bishop's Mantle,I really was disappointed that the book was not in good condition (I have photos) as it was supposed to be.
3,"Affordable Til Tuesday Sampler, but........","This is a concise and affordable Til Tuesday sampler, but let's face it; for just a few bucks more you can get the band's best album ""Everything's Different Now"" as well as the solid ""Welcome Home,"" which will get you all set for the really definitive pre-solo phase of Aimme Mann's career. ""Everything's Different Now"" is absolutely essential. Treat yourself and splurge."
5,Awesome 80's flashback! Aimee's voice is great to this day!,"I see Aimee Mann perform every time she comes to the Detroit area and just love her! This is a great compilation of the 3 'Til Tuesday releases, although I do recommend enjoying each in it's entirety, this encompasses the ""Best of"" very well."
4,Get it but not their best,"This can't be a greatest hits album. It starts out with EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENET NOW. That was the end of this group. One only needs to listen to EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT NOW and the next tune VOICES CARRY, and then back to the first and then the second again, to compare, contrast and understand something drastic happened to this band, suddenly and catastrophically. Aimee Mann was a part of Til Tuesday, but she was not Til Tuesday; and everything she did since then pales in comparison. This is not a greatest hits, much is missing. But buy it. Anything by this group is worth owning. They were great--truly magnificent."
3,"BUY ""EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT NOW"" INSTEAD...","aimee mann w/ til tuesday.nice group of songs, but you'll be cheating youselfif ALL 3 CDS are not bought!!!best one is ""EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT NOW""INLUDES THE SONG ""OTHER END OF THE TELESCOPE""ONE OF THE GREATEST INFLUENTIAL SONGS OF THE 80's!"
3,"Pretty funny, for a B-Flick","This is a pretty good movie, almost as funny as Revenge of the Nerds. The four nerds have some pretty funny scenes. Their are some semi-famous people, not really celebrities, but if you're looking at this page, you've probably seen them before: Troy Donahue, Linnea Quigley, Michelle Bauer, and Producer, Writer, and Director Richard Gabai, who also performs the ""Rockin' Tunes"" with his band, the Checks. The movie should keep you entertained for 82 mins. I haven't seen Assault of the Party Nerds II: The Heavy Petting Detective yet, but I can't wait."
3,Tantala cameo appearance-,Interesting but funky nostalgia film from the late 80s and early 90s. Famous erotic star Tantala Rey makes a rare cameo appearance. Fun film.
1,"Wimpy, amateurish ""Revenge of the Nerds!""","I hated this movie. It's badly acted, badly written, badlyplotted, and cheaply made! Very sleazy as well and this moviedefinetely didn't go to theatres! Linnea Quigley's voice was overdubbed who shouls be ashamed for her perticipation in this! Richard Gabai went on to direct ""Virgin High"" with most of the cast that is almost as bad. There's also a sequel to this movie, how lame!!!"

1,The cow and the elephant,"I bought this book for my son for Christmas, as a remembrance from childhood. It was advertised as being in good condition. It arrived with torn pages and torn binding, and in general very worn codition. My son opted to keep it, as is. I looked at new copies, that were priced in the $400. range. That is certainly not an option. The outside packaging was fine, so that was not an issue."
5,EXELENTE YURI,Esplendida com osiempre Yuri con este cd que es muy recomendado para fans y para todo tip ode publico que gusten de la buena musica
2,Yuri is back,"Yuri has been the brightes star in the mexican music sky, in fact for me the best of all.Unfurnatelly since ""Espejos del alma"" in 1995 her carrer took another path since she decided to commit her life into a Religious way, and since then any of her records has become unsucesfull and she had changed many times of recording company.Personally I don't like the style of this CD, and any of them since ""Espejos del alma"". Anyway, for all the fans of Yuri is a delight to have a new record of her, and hopefully one day she realises how much her fans we liked the style she had when she was the Number 1."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"Ok, straight to the point: There are only three (3)songs taken from the Minty's Christmas movie. Allthe other songs here are MLP takes on traditionalChristmas songs - none of which are in the movie(Rudolph, Frosty, etc). My daughter has watchedMinty Christmas I dunno, like 50 times, and she justisn't interested in songs not taken from the movie."
3,It had it's moments,This is a pretty good movie. It wasn't the greatest or the funniest I have seen. It had it's moments of funny. If your child is under the age of 5 or 6 this movie probably want keep their attention.
3,fun for the upper elementary set,Upper elementary school aged kids will love it and it is not too painful for parents for a family movie night.
4,Good fun for the little ones,"Very entertaining and comedic. My 5 year old was rolling on the floor laughing, yes I'll be adding this movie to our movie collection."
5,Fantastic,My daughter has been looking for this movie for a couple of years and I finally found it on Amazon for Christmas. She was thrilled and the movie is great for the entire family. : )
4,Aliens,I bought this for my grandson and he was happy with it. I thought the movie was fun to watch too. The delivery time was good and no complaints.
3,the second best movie ever by Devante Mahoganey,"Aliens in the attic is my second best movie in all of my twelve years of life .I have watched this movie forward and backwards.The plot of this movie is in a house they stay in for vacation. They are trying to exterminate some aliens that came from space. It first started when the boy and his sister's boyfriend went up to the attic to get to the satellite on the roof of the house, so they could see what was bugging it ,so there uncle and grandma could watch it. When they had seen what was wrong it nothing, could fix it because the aliens had did major damage to it.What the aliens really wanted was under the house.In this movie, I would give this 3 stars for the special effects. Because it didn't have very good effects it had regular effects."
5,Aliens in the Attic,Great movie with really funny scenes...nice for whole family with no swearing or obscene scenes...great humor...
4,Good Movie,"Was a Good all round family Movie - watched with my husband & two kids, aged 6 & 2 1/2 years - all enjoyed it. Not too scary, and quite funny."
3,decent family movie night movie,"Pretty light, mild violence, reasonably funny. Wouldn't watch it again, but the kids probably would. Why do they require so many words for reviews ...?"
4,Night to remember!,This was a very entertaining movie. Not to violent and yet just silly enough. We watch this movie after a family get-together and it was enjoyed by one and all. I would recommend this movie. This is a movie I will watch again.
3,Aliens...,I don't like alien movies but this one is so cute. In fact I like some of them better than the humans. It is a family movie but there are parts that could have been left out and it would have been better. What is it about cleavage that hollywood needs to put on us?Doris Roberts does a great job as a ninja grandma. She brings in a good bit of the lauging scenes.....
5,Great Shampoo,Was a bit skeptical about using this shampoo but wanted to give it a try as it is cruelty free and is paraben free. I have to say I am quite pleased with this shampoo and the way it leaves my fine but oily hair. Smells great too! Will purchase again :)
5,Makes me happy!,It makes me happy to use this. It smells delish and my hair loves it and I can be satisfied that I'm not supporting the abuse of animals by using it. Trifecta of good!
3,Maybe it will grow on me?,"K-Ci and JoJo maybe you all need the rest of the group back. After thoroughly enjoying the first release, I had my ears anticipating the sophomore only to be dissappointed. The songs are signature of the group and reflect maturity; however, I was looking out for that Jodeci Flare they once uniquely had before and still recognized in LOVE ALWAYS. Songs like Forever My Lady and I'm Still Waiting will forever be classics. Now listeners can barely recognize or remember that K-Ci and JoJo were ever apart of Jodeci, maybe that was the purpose."
4,kc and jojo have done it again,My boys have come thru again wit another bangin' joint and the best part....Jodeci might yet rise again...now that's worth the 13.99
5,"Slammin', Good lyrics--It's Real","I am really enjoying this album. I love all of the songs. K-Ci and JoJo have done it again, proving to the world that they've got what it takes to survive this music industry!! Now, I only wish that I could get the song that I've written for them to them. It'll be another smash hit!! Believe that!! I love them--simply love 'em!!"
3,A SNEAK PEEK?,"We hope. Spinning away from familiar R&B producers, the brothers present a glimpse of their future. Nothing particularly noteworthy here. Nothing bad either. K-CI and JOJO wanna do their own thing...this ""thing"" being a worthy, but unheralding start. Good luck!"
3,I'm not too sure about this one.,"I'm not too sure about this one. It is too melancholy for me. I think they should have done a few more up beat songs. am I the only one who noticed that the song titles are all about the same (i.e. I wanna get to know you, I wanna make love to you). A certain element of creativity is lacking. I'll keep listening and maybe it will grow on me."
2,DONT BUY,"i bought this CD and ended up takin it back a week later. All of the songs (except ""tell me its real"") have average lyrics, vocal arangements, and beats. They have a lot of potential, they jus should not be writin all of there songs. This album is worse then the last one because the last one had 3 good songs. This one only has 1."
2,This is not up to the standard they set for themselves.,"The first cd was much better. This one is about a girl creeping and cheating (after they fell completely in love on the first album). The best songs are fe fi fo fum (creeping), I wanna make love to you(tight), it's real(but it comes on the radio), Life(radio). The other songs MAY grow on you if you listen enough. Don't buy this expecting it to be anywhere near as good as the last. You can't sleep to it or make love to it because the songs are out of order. This is one you'll definately have to program."
2,They can't swing without DeVante,Jo-Jo can't sing. So badly he makes K-Ci sound bad. Maybe it's time for the Jodeci reunion. Maybe Mr. Dalvin can save them.
5,"Cool, Durable Watch","This is a very cool watch. It is tough, reliable, and gets the job done. The atomic function synchronizes the watch to an atomic clock in Fort Collins, CO every night (it tries four times). The solar portion makes sure that you'll never have to change the battery again. I love how the display of the watch is reversed, it doesn't make it more readable (actually, kind of the opposite), but it is rather cool. The watch crystal is recessed, so scratching it will be pretty hard. The watch has some weight to it, but it is not too heavy. The watch is big though and you may have a problem getting it under a sleeve. Otherwise, a great purchase and decent price (I got mine from Costco for $80)."
4,Great watch,This is a nice watch and I really like the Atomic aspect of this watch. Its not always easy to read but it does have a light. Because its solar the light only stays on for a second so you dont drain the battery to quickly. I would definately purchase this watch again.The blue part of the watch is nice looking as well it almost looks anodized.
4,great for removable car amplifiers,Use this product to quickly disconnect the 1/0 cable to your amplifiers to make it easier to remove .a little pricey though
1,A cheap price for a cheapo tripod... you get what you pay for,"A photographer friend and I both bought these because of the Sunpak name and because of the supposed great deal we were getting. As it turned out, both of our tripods quickly self destructed. He folded his up with the very first use and a support broke right off. I dropped the quick release plate on the floor and the little folding handle to turn the screw shattered. This tripod is cheaply made of cheap plastic. Don't buy it!"
4,Best $30 tripod,"I recently got this tripod for $30 on woot. For that amount of money I didn't expect much, I just needed a backup/secondary camera tripod. (my last one got mashed). It's sturdy with fairly smooth action - much better than I expected. I think this would fine for most still work (if you don't use too long a lens) or for small to medium size video cameras. It won't suit serious professionals (at that price, you wouldn't expect it to). It's easily worth the $30 I paid - or the $38 cost here."
4,"A ""MUST READ"" for every golf-aholic","This first try is First Rate. Any golfer will want many more from this ""inside the ropes"" point of view. The perfect Christmas present from any friend who wants to make a golfer smile."
3,Nice light read.,"Nice character developement in thise ""inside the ropes"" account of pro golf. Made me look differently at the players on TV after reading."
4,Get Swrewed and Chopped,"This is a good cd. It Is Lil Flip's U Gotta Feel Me, Chopped and Screwed. If you don't know what Chopped and Screwed is you need to learn some stuff about the Dirty South. I really enjoyed this cd. They should release some of Lil Flip and Three 6 Mafia older cd's Chopped and Screwed. R.I.P SCREW"
2,cluttered presentation,"there can be do doubt that all 3 major musicians are at the top of their game but this rereleased cd overflows with the recording techniques of its era. don burrows and george golla are well known to australian jazz audiences for their flawless,almost acoustic,approach to jazz ,yet they allow themselves ,in this release,to be dominated by all the less musical attractive recording techniques of echo,multi tracking and extranous noises. this is a pity as both australian musicians and louis bonfa could have done much better with a simple approach to the beautiful and senseous sound of brazilian music"
1,Don't Buy This Software - It's surplus and obsolete!,"This software is very out of date, and has been superceded by the lastest release, Creative Suite CS2."
4,You make it sound so easy!,"Karl, I'm glad you are doing this and not me, you make it sound so easy. This book is very entry level in Catholic apologetics, but of course when confronted with ant-catholicism it is always challenging. When you read Karl's books I can't believe there is so much division, no wonder our Lord prayed so hard, in the garden and asked Our Father may they be one just as we are one. Thanks Karl."
4,Keating: To The Point,"""The Usual Suspects: Answering Anti-Catholic Fundamentalists"" by Keating is a good first book for Catholics to read in order to answer attacks on their religion. He covers most of the usual subjects and does it in a concise and even-handed way. My biggest complaint is that occassionally, he writes as though we were all theologians...and then it's a tough read."
2,Much ado and little substance,"I approach Mr. Keating's books with great hopes, but always come away disappointed. The book does address many of the standard attacks against the Catholic faith, but too many of the ""opponents"" are presented as straw-men. The book has too much of the spit and polish of professional debaters and too little of the humilty and understanding that should be present in books of religious discourse. Mr. Keating presents many of his arguments as if he were arguing which pizza topping was better, green peppers or mushrooms. The book is useful in providing good footnotes for original sources."
4,"Good, but needs more info","This book gives you a good idea of what's out there, but I would have liked it better if it had photographs or copies of the original tracts. I had hoped to see what they looked like (so I could recognize them), but I guess there would have been copyright issues there."
5,Great compendium of buckwheat's tracks,"I have a number of Buckwheat albums, and have seen him live at the NJ Crawfish Festival several times. This album captures alot of the material he often plays live. I also like the fact that it has traditional Zydeco blues selections, cover songs from Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton, and newer upbeat originals. This is my favorite Buckwheat album. I wish it had ""Hard to Stop"" from the Trouble album, but that is the only thing lacking."
5,Ray Brown is always a source of reliable satisfaction!,"Ever since his Oscar Peterson days, Ray has delivered a solid swing below any balad or fast piece, instrumental or vocal. And I bought this album just for the Diana Krall songs... keep your eye on her!"
4,Unique Sessions!,"A great idea, Ray Brown! Love your choice of singers! Hearing Diana Krall scat on Little Boy is a pleasant surprise...very talented!!!"
2,OK .. look wise just so so,"Its well padded, the outer border lining has a visible conjunction (like a burnt fabric has, which is ugly)Usual size pulls ( not over sized as it has been described)nice padded handles.Big logo on the front pocket3 pockets in totalLooks wise it is so soNo belts inside to hold guitar in placeFeel like i paid a bit much for this. $29.99It fits my guitar F325 (yamaha gig maker)SIM"
3,Quality Bag with Mediocre Protection,"I recently bought my first guitar after many years of desiring to learn how to play. I have always had friends or family that were musically inclined so I am more than familiar with what constitutes a quality guitar case. This case was purchased in place of a $50 guitar bag (Road Runner) I bought at guitar center which I loved yet had to return due to financial reasons. Anyway, this bag is made very well yet lacks a lot of padding. There is enough padding to make you feel comfortable if you aren't moving it around a lot and aren't going on the road often, but if you are looking for protection I would look elsewhere. The bag is only worth the $30 I paid for it, not the $50 MSRP."
5,Nice bag,Cheap & useful!!!Feel like old fashion so I like this.It has 3 pockets and enough space.I like it!
4,Are Your Ready for your World Tour,This bag affords plenty of padding and a rugged exterior. The only thing I have against it is that the zippers stick every once and awhile. The front pouches are very handy-they carry a lot of gear.I think I got my money's worth.
5,great product!!,"This was perfect. Well made, shipped in a large box, wasnt all folded up.Very solid material.Well pleased.I would order again."
5,Great guitar bag,Love the gig bag comfortable backpack style carrying straps would definitely this bag to people who take the guitar places because the backpack straps make it easy
5,Love it,"This is a really nice guitar case. It is heavily padded and works great for traveling. A friend who has a hard case really like this case also. It has adequate pouches so you can carry extra strings, stringer, tuner, metronome, books, etc."
4,Baseball to the MAX!!,"Great Movie! I think it is hilarious. Especially without guys like Rick Vaughn, Willie Mays Hays, Jack Parkman. I do enjoy the new guys, like Billy ""Downtown"" Anderson, Taka Tanaka. It's funny how those guys don't appear but Pedro Cerrano does. Baseball fans, this movie's for you no questions asked!!!!"
4,Best of the Series!,Major League 3:Back to the Minors is the best of the series Scott Bakula is supprising funny! The creators of this film were abivoulsly going for a Tom Berenger rip-off and they did pretty well this film is based on the same ora of the first two films but takes the story in a different direction instead of being about Jake (Berenger) its about Gus Cantrell (Bakula) this film is a must see! Contains: Lauguage & Mild Violence
5,I loved this baseball movie,"I loved this movie. I've watched it over and over with my kids ages 7 & 10. It could have done without a couple of F-words and a couple of profane arm gestures, but other than that it was as wholesome as you can get today!/ No sex or nudity, no homosexuality, no violence or gore. Wish there were more movies like this one. PS We love baseball!"
1,Shame to the holy name of Major League,"This is just blasphemy. As a devoted (ridiculously, I might add) fan of the first, and appreciator of the second, I gotta give this one my lowest rating. Fans of the series will find little to enjoy about this made-for-video release.Clearly, Warner is trying to squeeze every last drop out of the Major League franchise..."
4,Good David and Goliath feature,Entertaining though predictable and worth the watch.Some favorites from ML 1 and 2 also in Major LeagueBack to the Minors..
5,ML 3,I love this movie series! This was a great addition to the first 2. Bringing Tanaka and Cerrano back as they did was very funny.
3,Same formula new characters,"Down and out team takes on what should be a superior team, needs to learn new things and over come challenges to be successful. Shows the characters developing and overcoming to win the day.Scott Bakula is the leading actor as a minor league ball player that has run his course, then an old friend wants him to manage a minor league team of the Twins. After some pause he takes on the position and immediately makes a difference. He has a young hot shot that is a little too anxious to get into the big league, this is his biggest challenge. In the midst of this, he has issue with the Twins Manager and makes several challenges against him."
3,Major League 3: Back to the Minors,its a good movie part of a set with out all the players....i love baseball and this set is very funny!
3,Not as good as the first two,"This movie is not as close to as good as the first two, but it is still funny in some parts. However this movie has nothing to do with the first two"
2,Why didn't they leave well enough alone?,"I have no idea if this film ever made it into the theaters, but I'm thankful I didn't get the opportunity to spend the eight bucks to see it. This movie is worth one viewing for the purpose of seeing what they could come up with next. Unfortunately, this movie fell far short of expectations and had all of the charm of Rookie of the Year."
2,Words made fleshy,"If you are for the ordination of women to the Catholic priesthood, against the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church, and question the authority and authenticity of the Sacred Scripture -- then this book is for you. Presented as a book about Communications, the book is full of the author's own personal theological and social ideas. Focuses on the ""Kingdom of Equality"" and ""Inclusive love."""
2,Just Pictures on the CD ROM,"I was expecting at least a synopsis of the book that would be searchable and give verbal guides as well as pictorial recommendations of techniques. This is just a pictorial supplement. The pictures and cine-loop presentations are nice, but this is not helpful to someone who is trying to perfect image acquisition and quality. If you do want this CD ROM for your collection, I recommend also getting a text so that questions which you may have will get answered. The CD does not address probe angle for any view, nor does it address technique as far as removing artifact. If your like me, you will want more of a reference than just a collection of pictures. the quality of the pictures is excellent. The ease of installation is a plus, as long as you do not have computer conflicts."
2,a bit disappointing,"Although this book has many technical points, the examples of work seem to lack an aesthetic that is more contemporary to my judgement. I would have liked to seen more ""edgy"" work examples."
4,Really an Encyplopedia,"This book has helped me in many ways. It is clearly written, covers quite a few topics and offers pointers that really make pastel paining easier, and more enjoyable"
2,Too basic,"Very basic. Lacks real instruction and certainly not an ""Encylopedia of Pastel Techniques"". A waste of my money."
4,Good performance for the price,"Has little imperfections, but the picture is crisp clear. After 10 months of everyday use no problems surfaced. In fact, I have it on a switch between 4 comps which run Win98/Win2000/WinXP, and it works fine with all of them."
1,how do i love thee,I have yet to receive this book that I had purchased. I had payed for it and still have not received it. When I do I will let you know what I think!
4,My ReViEw!!!!!,How Do I Love Thee was a great book. I enjoyed the descriptions of everything and it aloud me to visualise what was happeneing in the story. Also it made me thnik of real life problems and desieses that real people have to deal with in everyday life.And since it had three stories in one book i was always intertained during the whole book.That is my review of How Do I Love Thee.
5,BEST BOOK!,This is the best book ever. I love this book so much. I love the author to i have read almost all of her books... I just love them because i am a very caring person so i like books that show others help. they are sad books but i love the most the one last wish ones. All the books make me cry but i just love reading them and i have a friend that likes to read romance well instead of romance i read these books. I hope this helps...
3,Pretty good,"Like all of Lurlene McDaniel's books, this one was good. My favorite story was Night Vision. I didnt really like Bobby's Girl, because I hated the way Dana treated him. Everything she told him was a lie. I couldnt believe Lurlene McDaniel would write something like that. Its like shes telling everyone who reads this book that its okay to lie to and bertay the person who you are sopposed to be completely honest with. I couldnt stand reading about that girl lying all the time. Even though I know they are only characters, I like to think that Bobby went to college and met a girl who would treat him with the respect he deserves, something Dana never did. Laura's Heart was okay, but VERY unrealistic. Night Vision was really great, though. I kinda wish that Lurlene McDaniel had made it its own book. Anyways, this is an okay book, but if you believe in being honest, you may not like Bobb's girl."
5,Good Book,"This book suprised me. I did not think that it would be this good. I have all of McDaniel's books, and this is very good. Bobby's Girl is my favorite, it made me cry. Laura's Heart was probably the weakest novel, but still, incrediably compassionate. I think this was a very well composed book."
2,Well.....,"What can I say? Some people are fine reading another romance from Lurlene McDaniel, and some are not. I am annoyed that this has been the deal for too long. I think that there should be a different genre . . . not romance. Readers get tired of the same old thing over and over. McDaniel needs to face reality and learn what customers want: VARIETY! The stories themselves were also poor. Brett's summer fling with Shayla, a girl with a genetic disease proved a yawnfest, Dana's love for two brothers proved annoying and Laura's secret romance with Ramon proved to be boring. Why do we as customers continue to buy these books? I don't see."
3,Ban This Bomb?,"The Penetrators is the poor man's Fail-Safe. It is an easy breezy read. It theme is not accidental war, but should we convert to a solely automated defense/offense system: of having ICBMs completely replace the manned bomber fleet. However, that would seem to conflict with the traditional TRIAD American system, of land-based missiles, a bomber force at home and overseas, and submarine launched missiles. This system drove the Russians crazy, and forced them to spend money they did not have. Anthony Gray is the pen name of Hank Searls, the liner notes makes it sound that for some profound reason he had to use other name, but I don't see why. What was the Air Force going to do? Stamp his Social Security Card ""No Desert?"" The book gives a good idea of just how sophisticated the America defense complex was in the pre-historic days of 1964; possibly is a taste of the heavy technology we see in Tom Clancy's novels."
4,prttygood,"i took the course online and because of the disorganization of it, i was not able to learn the sufficient info. this book helped quite a lot, although i think on certain areas it was a bit light on coverage. it could use additional practice questions and practice tests."
4,You'll know if this is someone you love!,"When I saw the title I knew it applied to my life and my relationship with my elderly mother. As I turned each page I had the vague sense that someone had been eavedropping during the time she was living in our household. ""Toxic"" described her interaction with everyone who cared about her. This book preserved my mental health! It contains clear descriptions of the toxic personality and gives guidelines for dealing with people who have this world view. If you are struggling with a difficult sibling, spouse, or parent, read this book. Protect yourself from this condition."
3,Eh... it's okay for the young.,"I bought this cd when it first came out, as my first real taste of anything even remotely classical. And for that purpose, it works. For someone getting into classical seriously though, I'd start somewhere else."
3,Pleasant,"I bought this album for the tracks with Russell Watson and Pavarotti, and, as usual THEY didn't disappoint me. I really didn't care much for the other tracks."
5,so far so good,"Based on other reviews, I purchased these for dark t-shirts even though I was doing white shirts. I did 2 shirts, and so far no problems. They've been washed a few times and we've had no issues. They were very easy to use & I will use them again."
5,Perfect for making inexpensive t-shirts,"I bought these in the hopes of making some cheap, personalized t-shirts. I used plain black Dickie's shirts and got great results with these transfers. The white parts are bright, the colors look good, and they have stood up to SEVERAL wearings and washings without peeling or anything. Great value!"
1,A pox on Avery for this product! They should be ashamed!,"Avery 3279 Inkjet Dark T-Shirt TransfersOverpriced and way too difficult to use. Following the instructions exactly regarding timing, the first image burned. Could not fully remove it, so the item was ruined. Could not then separate the backing from any of the remaining four sheets, so the entire package of transfers was wasted. Considering the price, it seems reasonable to expect that the backing would have pullable tabs like a band-aid to enable separation without smudging the design or otherwise destroying the transfer."
3,Worked pretty well.,"I have used the Avery transfers for white/light before with good luck on a white shirt. So, now I've tried this to put transfers on dark color shirts. They worked ok. The color of the shirt shows through the lighter colors on my design, so the colors are ""off"" from what I wanted. And the colors are a little dull. But I had no problem with the transfer itself and it went through one wash/dry well. For comparison, I tried the white/light transfer on the same dark color to comare, and the colors did turn out better with the dark transfer paper. I haven't used any other transfer paper on dark colors for comparison, but I was a little disappointed in the performance, but it's acceptable."
2,not on black shirts,"I tried to use these on a black t-shirt, and it worked.... sort of.The colors were significantly less bright after ironing them on.The image was there, it was just... very dull. Not what I expected."
2,Disappointed,"Although it was difficult to separate the backing, once I did it did not come off cleanly leaving paper behind. Worthless."
3,Basically does the job,"First, I have not tried other brands, so I can't give a comparison. Other reviewers here say that this is superior, which is why I bought it.I've now applied large & small transfers to 5 shirts, at 4 different times. It mostly went as the other reviewers have described. To remove the backing, you have to ""tear"" the paper back by stretching the transfer - without distorting it or making the ink flake. This was a bit of a challenge. When I apply the transfers, I have gotten spots on every single one. I think I've followed the instructions exactly, but it still might have been something I did wrong. In the end, I got basically useful shirts, but next time I'll take the time to have them screen printed because the quality of these isn't what I need for the long-term. For a short-term solution, I was happy to have something that is basically and minimally sufficient for my needs."
1,i disagree with product claim,"i used this product to iron onto a black shirt and it left the image barely see-able. i was very, very disappointed."
5,"""Should I"" Buy?? Yes you Should!!!","Grenique is definetly putting it down with this album. If you like Maxwell, Chico Debarge, Badu, or Raashan Patterson you will love this Chocolate Goddess. ""Should I"" is just the tip of the ice berg. When you listen to ""Angel"" or ""Anything"" you will understand where I am coming from. Also listen close to ""Love Within"", You will not skip tracks on this CD, but you will rewind!"
1,so sad!,i am completely disappointed! i thought that this cd would be magnificently wonderful but it was flat and weak. i thought it would be a cool breath of fresh air but it was stale and lukewarm. i would warn everyone against buying this album unless they wanted Muzak elevator tunes that don't move or affect in anyway. i wish i could say better things but i take my music seriously and do not want you to be decieved about the quality of this album. i hope she does worlds (read: universes) better with a sophomore album.
3,Not As Good As I Expected,"After listening to the CD a few times, it has grown on me some, but by no means does it compare to ""Baduizm"", ""Rashaan Patterson"", or any other CD I've heard it compared to."
1,Neo-Zero,"Unfortunately, I have to say that Grenique's debut is boring. The songs are flat and dull, none of them really shine. The only track that could possibly grow on you is ""Should I"", a somewhat depressing song where she considers leaving her struggling boyfriend. Grenique's ""Black Butterfly"" was not a wise purchase for me. I recommend AGAINST buying this album. Trust me!"
1,There must be a better way to waste your cash.,"Don't bother with this lame disc . There are many other female R&B singers working today with more to offer. You can bet that if Grenique weighed a hundred pounds more and was a few shades darker, this sorry attempt would never have been released."
2,It's A Shame...,"...cause this girl can sing. But this cd, which I bought when it first came out and evey once in awhile I pull it out and go ""dang, how come I didn't like this"" and after listening to a few tracks realize ""oh, cause the songs suck"". The only good track on here is ""Star of the Story"", which really shows off her mature singing voice, as she patiently lifts the notes from bottom to mid range."
3,The rest of the CD falls short of the lead single,"When I first heard the single, ""Should I"", I was blown away. I couldn't wait to hear this CD. I rushed out and bought it the release day. I was a bit dissapointed. As an overall listen it is NOT a bad CD, but no other song on the album measures up to the punch of 'Should I'. The other tracks sound a little less jazz oriented and seem like an attempt to produce a more washed out more commercial sound than the sound that made, say, Erykah Badu known. Again, this is a good album. But if you're expecting a revolutionary CD, this aint the one."
5,"Earthy, deep, excellent!!!","Finally, a CD that you can enjoy from the beginning to the end. Grenique captures the esssence of her spirituality, the realness of her being and the honesty of her heart and combines them all for one truly captivating experience. Personal favorites are numbers 6 through 10, but to be in tune with her world, start with number 1. Light your candles and incense, close the shades, turn down the lights and feel the experience that is - GRENIQUE."
5,I have good expectations for this woman.,"I've known of Grenique since I saw her video for ""Should I"" which is a lovely slow jam with a great setting and smooth melodies. I love her music."
3,Grenique sounds great,"This sister is warm and soulful. I heard her live at Bar Nun (The Movement) in DC last Monday and she was just as warm, sincere and natural as her CD sounds. Go girl. Keep on 'keepin it real.' Looks like you have some envious former-friends writing reviews in here, but keep doin your thang and you will fly! Peace."
5,DEFINITLEY A MASTERPIECE,"Grenique is in a class with Jill Scott, Erykah Badu, Angie Stone, Davina, & others having a Jazzy R&B soulistic style. Her cd is great! I have an ear for soul (""real"" music), and when I first heard ""Should I"", I knew I should & did buy the entire cd. Grenique without a doubt deserves more recognition than she gets.Soul Searching 4 Life,SoulCatcher"
3,DOWN DAKOTA WAY,"I rate this dvd a 3 star, only because of the ommitance of approximately 15 minutes. Being an avid fan of Roy Rogers, I want to see his movies in the uncut version. That includes the Republic logo at the start and end of the movie. The quality is excellent and so is the extra information. I am hoping that some other company will be producing these movies in the uncut version on dvd."
4,"Beautiful to look at, gorgeous to play","I've been playing the flute for thirty years (novice, of course) and finally had to retire the Artley my grandfather bought me with his discount back when I started. I've been looking (and asking) for a new flute for several years now and finally received this one for my birthday. It came well packaged with the keys properly protected with cork inserts and a nice fitting carrying case. The tone is spectacular, as I'd expect of a Hamlin. Whether you're a grade school enthusiast that's committed to playing this type of woodwind instrument or a community band member, even a novice soloist, this is a well-priced, well tooled, beautiful instrument to own. I highly recommend it."
2,For Collectors Only,"J.C. Vaughn and company really should have stopped with the ""One Shot."" In trying to capture the time element of ""24,"" which you really can't do on the printed page, we're given a story that makes hardly any sense. The action is hard to follow and the surreal photorealistic art doesn't help matters. In fact, it was so surreal, I couldn't even make out what was happening in the final panels, which wrapped up the entire ""story."" Plus, Vaughn seems to obsessed with Jack's heroin addiction, which is really not important to the plot.If you're a big ""24"" fan, you may want to have this for a collectors item. Otherwise, save your money."
2,The Exorcist was Great. This isn't.,"Those looking for a a followup to Blatty's The Exorcist (a truly great novel, and one of the rare bestsellers actually worthy of the acclaim it received) will be disappointed with this rather limp Hollywood satire. It's overwritten and the humor is strained. If you want humerous horror, try William Browning Spencer's Resume With Monsters."
5,Magical music to take you to another time.,"I have been listening to this music since I was 12 years old. I had the opportunity to meet Jimmie when he played Tulsa in 1981. He was as his music- genuine. This CD is, in my opinion, his best work. It is a must for a serious collection. How wonderful to finally have some of his music released on CD. We can only hope that the rest of his works will follow."
1,Read Cowan's bio...,"...for the first clue that this book is new age-eco/spiritual claptrap masquerading as historical fiction. I typically would not bother to give a book a bad review, but in this case I felt like I had been tricked into reading it. If you liked ""The Celestine Prophecy"", or if you have an interest in aboriginal cultures, you might buy into this book. I myself had to laugh at the feeble ironies and trite philosophizing wrapped up in cloying prose. Cowan has a few favorite ""serious fiction"" words that he uses over and over again, adding to the dizzying repetitiousness of these loosely connected stories. Cowan's ironic insistence that he is telling a ""true story"" is pointless and serves only to obscure whatever fact is present. I will say that premise here is quite interesting, but in it's execution Cowan swings big and misses."
2,Read on!,"For a project in my world history class, we had to read a historical novel, then, write an essay about the plot, the story, etc.I chose this book because it sounded interesting, and it was only 150 pages.From the start, it was hard to understand, not to interesting, and boring. So i looked around the internet to find reviews and summaries about it, and after reading many, i found the book to be quite interesting, and i started reading it.Later, i find out the book is worth reading because it gets better as you read on if you really think about what's going on."
2,RED!,"This item is difficult to review. First of all, the red is amazing. Gorgeous! The best red I've seen, I love it. My hair is dark brown, and the red showed up nicely.That's the good news. The bad is that the red washed out within two washes. And, this was the most difficult dye I ever worked with. It stained my ceramic tiles, the grout, my face, my arms and nails, my floor. It ruined my bathroom carpet. I use dye all the time, and yes, it splatters, but always if I wipe it quickly, it is fine. And never had I had my shower and tub stained so badly.So, make your own choice. The red is excellent but be careful! Other Manic Panic red dyes last longer and don't stain things that are not your hair as badly, but are not as brilliant a red either."
3,Stains Really Badly,My hair is really black so when I put it on and there wasn't much change in my hair color I wasn't surprised but what really got to me were the stains that it left behind. Some of the product fell on the counter and when I wiped it off there was a whole bunch of pink leftover. Also do as it says do not let the product touch your scalp because tight now my scalp is hot pink. My hands and nails are still pink because I made an elementary mistake and washed the product out without any gloves on.
5,I can't get enough!!!,"""It's About Time"" has great harmonies, fun lyrics, dreamy ballads; it's all here...starting out catchy and poppin', taking you on a journey to aural paradise, ending in harmonic heaven with ""The Laughter Of Your Voice""...you'll think you're on the beach; palm trees and all. All that's missing is the sand.John Hunter Phillips: remember that name!!!"
5,Beach Boy Wonder,"If you like the Beach Boys, you will love this CD. The harmonies are intriguing,the arrangements most pleasing,& John's voice is amazing in all parts. John's own songs added to the mix make for a must have. Would love to hear an ""All John"" CD down the pike. I'd buy it in a heartbeat!"
2,Not interested,"Unfortunately, the kids can't yet figure out how to put the ark back together as it has many pieces. My twins are just over 2. They just abandoned it. Perhaps they'll play with it later, but it just doesn't work in the tub or the play area."
2,Sharp Spanish/English Translator,"Most of the Spanish we are familiar with here in the U.S. is Latin Spanish. Nowhere on the outside of the package does it specify that this product is Spain Spanish. You don't find this out until you've purchased, opened, and read the enclosed instructions. I've looked up a several words and it seems half the time the display shows the word as, ""NOT FOUND.""It is however, easy to use, compact, and lightweight. Very nice size if you are traveling."
2,Not for math majors.,"I have only seen the preliminary edition of this book. I think that it is too spread out, its exercises involve long calculations but never any challenge and that it involves long sections of non-math that could very well be omitted. Often one has to skip five or six pages to get to the next available mathematics. It is a good book for someone that wants to learn a little bit of differential equations during their bed time reading, but should not be used for a sophomore level differential equations course."
1,Horrible paedagogical dreck,"This book is a DE text for students who've had the misfortune to have been subjected to ""reformed calculus""--- i.e., calculus without algebra. There is very little substance here, only high-school level chit-chat and ""qualitative analysis"" of nearly trivial problems. The writing style is insulting to anyone other than brain-dead pedagogs."
1,Oi Vey,"A ponderous, meandering exposition of mathematical trivia and trivial mathematics. In fairness, it must be said that the book may be of some interest to those seeking a cost-efficient alternative to a prefrontal lobotomy. It also provides the first known counter-example to the Baire Category Theorem: a book that is complete in its uselessness, and yet, is the union of a countably infinite set of nowhere-dense pages."
2,The Trouble With Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam,This book is truely the case of dumb and bumber. Dumb criticizing dumber for being bumb.
1,Faulty Reserch,"If you want to read a good text on the black Muslims, read C. Eric Lincolns ""The Black Muslims in America"" or Steven Tsoukalas ""The Nation of Islam: Understanding the Black Muslims"". In both of these books, the authors do not bash the Black Muslim,but bring a very detailed outline of what the Black Muslims believe and thier history. With Elreta Dodds, however, that is all she is doing. Chapter after chapter she's just takes apart the Black Muslims theology based on premises that have no business being in her critque of the NOI. At the back of the book, thier is a list of her sources, and the only book I can find that is a legitimate source got finding out about Black Muslim information is C. Eric Lincolns book. Dodds has written a book that comes from a closed minded CHristian perspective. Her mind set is ""If it's not Christian, then it is not good"" When writting a book such as she has, she should have been a little more sensative towards her research and to whom she is talking to."
5,Elreta's evidence of Farakhan's deception,"This book was indeed the best presentation of truth; not just from an apologetic view but from a cultural as well as a biblical view. The evidence is well researched and accurate. No true knowledge presented can ever be called dumb. (Such a poor choice of words for a book review...).A must read to all who desire to know the truth about Farakhan,and the devices and deceptions that plague this generation. Its a well written book that proves how we perish for lack of knowledge."
1,It should'nt even get 1 star,"This is a prime exsample of Black people not sticking together. Although I am not a follower of the Nation of Islam, I do agree with some of the teachings. In this world we live in we are always going to have naysayers especially when a Black man is standing up for what is Right. The author apparantly is a naysayer because Truth hurts and Right will sound strange to Wrong. She needs to study her history a little more. When she studies her history a little more she will understand where the Minister is coming from. This ""Holy Bible"" that she holds on her pedistal has been tampered with, transformed, and undergone a white wash. Wake up....This is definatly not a good book to get."
4,Meet Your Friends and Enemies of the Plant Kingdom,"James Wiltens has carefully chosen 60 or so of plants found in Northern California that can easily be identified by beginning naturalists and botanists as edible or poisonous plants. Each plant covered in the book includes information about where to find it, how to prepare and eat it (or avoid it), as well as interesting trivia about some of the species. Wiltens has also included a drawing of each plant, noting its key identification features. Be sure to read Wiltens' introduction, covering the do's and don'ts and safety of flower collecting!"
2,Check it out - literally,"I was ready to buy this book when I realized I could check it out at the local library. This book isntworth the money, there isnt anything in its pages that one can not find in any other edible and useful plant (of California) book out there. Im glad I did not buy it."
4,Great music and some rare tracks from an amazing band,"Hard to get a collection of songs that affect you as much as these will. Some live, some demos and all so strong. To hear some new songs, you may want to check out Shanti Project Collection which features three. Mark Kozelek is one of the best songwriters of our generation."
4,"An arid, violet, starry dusk in the summer; quite good","With the murmur of crickets bookending the songs on this album, and the songs all falling into the same languid, edgy atmosphere, the album deserves to be played straight through on the first listening. You'll hear ghosts of appalachian folk, the Pixies, Tom Verlaine and Television, Nirvana, and Gilberto Gil. And it goes by quickly in just three quaters of an hour. But on repeated listening to individual songs, the atmosphere becomes much more dense with something you have to attribute entirely to Kristen's unique sensibilities. She piques into feelings of insecurity with a sense of ambition, to travel away from them. And Kristen's voice rings with remarkable comfort despite never coddling the listener with too much syrop at all. Highlights are the songs Echo, White Trash Moon, Costa Rica, Cathedral Heat, and Spring."
3,memories for me,"My mother owned a first edition of this sweet book and as a child I was enchanted. The pictures in the book let you see the now queen and princess as little girls, playing and horse riding and being royal. I treasured the book and named my oldest daughter Elizabeth because of the glitter I saw with the little girls. My mother gave the book to me when I was a teenager and I had kept it for 40 years. I loaned the book to a friend and it was lost. I am now 55 and only lost it 5 years ago. I am very anxious to own another one. I think all ages of girls would love to read this book of another life that few of us can ever know."
5,A Must-Have book for collector's,"I've been collecting Ransburg items for years. Until this book, there has not been a source to find out information about Ransburg collectibles. The book is not only a gorgeous keepsake (every page is packed with full-color photography) but it provides more information than I every dreamed existed on this subject. I had no idea the breadth and depth of Ransburg items nor the interesting history of the company and its founder. I'm so pleased with the book---it has helped me recognize values and expand and appreciate my collection. What a find!"
5,"Good text, Magical illustrations by the great N.C. Wyeth","Just love this book, it is in fact a good story, in a good environment. The strongest point of this edition is, in my opinion, the colourful and extremely beautiful illustrations by NC Wyeth."
3,Just a simple spoonula,It's a well made kitchen tool but maybe a bit too much so. It's a bit bulky for my liking but it's a fine piece. I wouldn't but a second though.
3,Not as good as I expected,"Expensive for what you get. Lightweight and well constructed but, the wrist pad comes off easily when moving the iLap around in your lap. Looks great with an aluminum Macbook Pro. It reduced the amount of heat felt in your lap but a notebook cooler with fans, like one sold by Antec, does a much better job of keeping your lap cool."
3,Quality Issues,"A few weeks after buying it, I loved every single bit of it. Using it was a bliss. But a month or two of continuous use, I've come to realize a few quality issues. Mainly related to the cushion. It's not that well made and it deforms quite fast, leaving you with no support whatsoever. I could say that a few stitches to secure the fit of the fabric and the foam would have helped a lot.But besides that, it's a reasonably good product that I don't regret buying."
4,Pricey But Very Good,"I shouldn't complain about the price because I picked up mine on ebay for $20. I've had other laptop holders that were a lot cheaper. If you can pick it up cheaply like I did, it is a very good laptop stand. It does the job and the removable cushion is a nice feature. It does have a tendency to slide downwards when you remove the cushion so the cushion may be less removable than you at first think it is. It does remove the heat from your lap though which is the main reason you get one of these. It is very good for using your laptop in bed or while curled up on a sofa."
5,"Great looking, works perfectly and will add life to my Mac!","I am so glad that I got this stand - I am so much more comfortable with the laptop off my lap, and I know that a cooler laptop is a happy laptop! Even though this cost more than I originally planned to spend - I know it will help my Mac last much longer - so totally worth it!"
5,MUST HAVE !,"It is by far, the best accessory for my macbook! I spent money left and right for different laptop stands, and none compare with this one. It is a little pricy, but is worth it! My wrist was hurting me so bad, until I got this iLap, and now I cannot stay away from my notebook. Just perfect !"
4,Don't be Cheap like me!!!,"Length:: 0:57 MinsLike the title says I debated on whether to spend the [...] for this thing, but don't be cheap like me...it is really helpful, and makes your laptop much easier to use. There are some other cheaper ones out there but they don't get good reviews.Oh and yes, ""it's great"" is two words....If you have a Mac, just buy it."
4,"The cure for laptop ""hot lap"" syndrome",My laptop was uncomfortably hot on my lap -- even when I put a pillow between me and my computer. This product completely solves that problem.The only negative is that you can't really lie down comfortably and use this laptop stand. You have to prop it against your legs in a somewhat awkward position so that you can see your screen.
4,"great product, over priced","i love the product. works very well sitting, laying down. little on the pricey side though, but would still buy"
3,As advertised,"This gadget works as advertised, but I rarely use it. I find I prefer a pillow or a folded blanket rather than something metal on my lap most times. It seems bulky to use and to store. But, given the many positive reviews, this may just be a personal preference. I also thought it was a lot more money than it should be."
4,swagman bike rack,very sturdy. easy to take on and off of the truck. easy to secure bikes on rack. don't be discouraged if some of the holes don't line up during assembly. less than a minute with a round file will fix the problem. a great rack for about $100.
5,Bike Rack,"I have yet to take this bike rack on a road trip, but I have tested it out with bicycles on it, and it seemed very sturdy. The first thing you notice when you get the package is how heavy it is. Nothing flimsy on this thing! I was a little worried it might be too heavy for my car, but the trailer hitch seemed to have no problem with it. Might make a difference on gas mileage, but I'll be confident that my bicycles are secure. As I had read in other reviews, it is a little tight to fit 3 bikes on it. I have 2 bikes to transport, but decided to get the 3-bike rack, and am glad I did. Not sure my 2 bikes would have fit, however, one of them is an old, heavy bike, so some of the newer and more streamlined bikes might fit 3 just fine."
1,Do NOT BUY,Do not buy these if your looking to buy the talismoon fan it will kill your fan power supply! Buy the storm LEDs they are way better and can be combined with the whisper and whisper max fans
1,wrong sheets in package,"Warning !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I ordered two sets of these sheets. The first set was NOT Joseph Abboud sheets. They were JC Penny "" masterpiece "" sheets.I ordered a second set in case it was a mistake. They also were JC Penny "" Masterpiece"" sheets. These are nice sheets however. Very deep pockets with elastic all the way around. Well made and good quality. The sheets are soft enough but not as soft as I would expect for a sateen but that is fine with me becase I like a crispier ( is this a word?) sheets. These do wrinkle.I was offered return free of charge...as Amazon has excellent customer service."
1,Not Joseph Abboud Sheets,"I ordered two sets and both turned out to be JC Penny's brand instead of Joseph Abboud's. The labels on the plastic bags said they were Joseph Abboud but after unfolding, the labels on the sheets were JC Penny. Very misleading. It's too much of a hassel to return. I also ordered a king size comforter set but received a queen size set instead (eventhough the plastic bag said it was king) so I decided to keep them and just not buy anything from Amazon again."
1,Still not Joseph Abboud sheets,"I purchased a Joseph Abboud sheet set on December 15, 2005. I received a JC Penney sheet set in a Joseph Abboud bag. I've read numerous complaints on Amazon.com in recent months concerning this very issue. I assumed a reputable company would have addressed and rectified this ongoing error, but I have been proven wrong."
5,Rae Marcus is a gifted poet,"This book is a wonderful collection of poetry created by a talented and gifted author. It shows emotion and gives images in every sentence, phrase, and word."
1,NEVER ORDER FROM OLD GLORY,I requested verification of delivery three times via email. None of my emails were responded to forcing me to file a claim with Amazon.com. I will NEVER order anything from Old Glory again.
1,NEVER ORDER FROM OLD GLORY,MY ORDER NEVER ARRIVED. I EMAILED OLD GLORY THREE TIMES REQUESTING TRACKING INFORMATION AND NEVER RECEIVED A RESPONSE. I FINALLY CONTACTED AMAZON.COM AND REQUESTED A REFUND. I WILL ORDER FROM OLD GLORY AGAIN.
5,Fabulous,"I have been using and buying this book since it was 1st published. I love it!I'm an RN. I train non-professionals and family members on medications.This is an invaluable tool!The fact that it is in English (not technical words), explains medical jargon,uses,side effects, etc and catagories of real life situations, many people can relate.I use it frequently.Thank you for demystifing medications.Mecrn"
1,not in stock,"I bought the product in good faith, the seller claims amazon got the part numbers wrong and I am waiting for my refund so I can purchase elsewhere. Check with the seller before buying this item."
2,Not sure about this book,I do not believe that it is totally biblical. I did not have a peace about it. iIt came quickly and in good shape.
4,A Wonderful Singer,"Lorrie Morgan is a fine country singer. Her voice is full of the emotion of the songs that she sings. You can hear the pain, the longing, the joy. On this album, she even tackles a Lennon-McCartney song 'Eight Days a Week' and turns it into a country tinged rocker, with some great help from Vince Gill on guitar. I highly recommend this cd."
1,whack as hell,"pras got called out in wyclef's 'where fugees at"" about how he barely did any producing on the first fugees record but took all of the production credits. this cd is worth as much as an old aol disc...nada!"
1,Ghetto supaDROPOUT,"Unlike most CD's this one gets worse evry time i listen to it. I'm sorry but the fugees were great so if you wanna stick with them you betta getting The Carnival - Wyclef Jean. That is real music. He's got it goin' on, not this. It is a waste of money. S O R R Y P R A S"
3,This could be made better.,"This album is spoilt by the Gospel singing, phone interludes and editing of explicit lyrics. If Pras didn't want swearing on this album, he should have told his guests not to swear rather than cutting words out with ridiculous noises. If it wasn't for these mistakes, this album would be as good as any of the other Fugee solo efforts. Pras has created his own style that is very listenable. I look forward to his next album and hope he learns from his mistakes. Mostwanted and Free make excellent contributions. I would go as far as to say that Pras should reproduce this album with explicit lyrics included, and with the other alterations I have suggested, even just a limited edition. I would certainly buy it."
1,Pras is not a rapper,"He rode the Fugees wave to stardom, and honestly he might be a good producer, but with Lauren and Clef on a record, the record is going to hit hard no matter who else is on there, as Pras shows and proves. In fact it's hard to tell exactly what Pras ever did. He was a third wheel musically, and next to the other two it was almost embarrassing when he grabbed the mic. It's sad that he got a solo deal while other rappers are out there with talent but no visibility. The title says it all ""Ghetto Superstar."" People ride his jock but the props he gets are always second-hand."
2,what a letdown,"when i first heard pras on a record in The Score and then on wyclefs solo album i practically wet my pants when i found out that pras had a solo album in the works.... then i bought it pras changed his style people have come to love and then on top of that made some tracks that were just plain stupid (ie.lowriders,for the love of this just to name a few) i give it 2 mics because of the 2 good tracks (ghetto supastar,dirty cash)"
2,This album is psycho,The album Ghetto Superstar is quite bad exept for the hit single: Ghetto Superstar
2,What happened too the Pras?,"Ill have too say that I was rather dissappointed in this album. I am a big fugees fan and have every fugees album and all the solo allstars albums too. If you are deciding too pick this album up I suggest you listen too it first. The only new songs I somewhat enjoy on this album are ""Blue Angels"" and ""Lowriders""(even though it has a horrible chorus). The rest of the the songs are average and below(mostly below). I would recommend this album to people who lean more too the rap side of the fugees rather than the r&b side."
5,praz and wyclef.... whereever u r right now hear this!,"I cant impresse it with words this is the most ...oh my god im so wordless ,i love them ,i would 2 anything just to be with them im so sad that i live so far away from usa and havent gotta chance to meet them :( and im also sorry i havent had the chance to grow up with them and their MUSIC.I M THE FAN #1."
5,Buy this CD just for the new ballad recording,"Once again, John ""Jellybean"" Benitez has ruined a gem of a song with his particularly tone-deaf sense of remixing. The new ""Love in the Shadows"" release still merits five stars, owing to the extremely moving piano ballad version highlighting E. G. Daily's soaring, pitch-perfect vocal quality. The 1986 extended version remains, by far, the greatest dance record ever made, with E.G.'s melody alone ranking second to none. Buy this CD for the ballad version, then move heaven and earth to locate the old 12"" on vinyl. Worth its weight in gold, you'll be glad you mined for it."
5,Waited a long time for this one on CD,"I ran across this CD and was really excited. At first I was a little disappointed that it was a remake, I liked the original 80's version a lot. After listening I grew to like it more and more. The Piano Mix adds a great different version to the song and I might have to say I like it almost the most on the CD. This is a great song and I would love to get the original 80's version on CD, but not sure that will ever happen. Great CD, everyone should check it out."
1,This cd is awful,"I consider myself a fairly dedicated parrothead. I bought this cd for my Mom thinking she might enjoy steel drums to some songs she new. I asked her what she thought of it several weeks after her birthday and she was quite vague mainly saying that she enjoyed the Buffett versions of the songs more. Last week I had to borrow her car and this cd was playing on her stereo. I started laughing and couldn't stop while it played. The songs sounded like the versions you would hear a... bad band playing at a Caribean themed bar at a Holiday Inn. Have some respect would you? Buffett is awesome. If you are looking for some reggae Buffett buy the Club Trini cd. You even get Jimmy covering the Marley classic ""No woman, No cry"". Leave this cd for the bargain bins at the convenience store..."
1,Just listen to the music bits,"I like reggae music and I really like Buffett, so I thought this was a great concept. However, after listening to the music bits for the songs given here, my comment is ""No Way!"""
1,A disappointing book,"This was not the best book about itas. It was not even a so-so book. It was badly written and the themes seemed randomly pasted together. I think the author tried to give an account of itas from the beginning of creation according to yoruba peoples until the present time. However, the book had too many digressions. It was also hard to read because simple things like spelling, punctuation, and complete words and sentences were often not correctly used. There was also a lot of misinformation about basic themes in itas. If the author wants to make up his own fiction that's ok. But he shouldn't pass this book off as something definitive on itas because it is not. After reading this, I don't think I would gamble on an Oba Ecun book again."
1,It was OK but I did not like it too much,It was confusing. Many of the stories I grew up with are not told correctly. There are a few good things about the book like the family relations between the gods. But even some of these ties are not correct. I ask myself why this book was written and I can't find an answer.
1,Below Average Effort in Intended Subject Area,"""Ita ..."" manifests as a below average effort in its intended subject area, Yoruban mythology. I read the Spanish version of the piece, which is contradictory in many places and is notable for its numerous grammatical and syntactical errors. Being well versed in the subject area, I describe ""Ita ..."" as a generally lackluster and disappointing read. This is definitely not a gem in the crown of Yoruban myth literature. The contradictions that abound in the piece are bound to confuse the novice reader and to irritate seasoned ones."
2,"Volume 2, Manual of the Grasses of the United States",I was disappointed with this volumne as 70% of the book is a list of references for Volumne 1. Looking at the index revealed that the real meat of information is in Volume 1 making Volume 1 relatively useless.
5,Wood High Chair Tray,"I had been looking for a replacement high chair tray for a wonderful old (frog) high chair that I've had and just could not find one. I measured the old tray, and this tray, although a different company, was the right size. I commented last week that I loved the way it felt when I clicked it into the high chair. It's solid and very nicely finished. I also bought the protective tray cover. The hardware is included and you attach it to fit for your high chair. If this is the correct size I would highly recommend it and if you can find the cover I think you would really appreciate having it."
5,"A review of ""Time for a Cuppa!""","Jack Hargreaves, Novelist, April 26, 2002,This is novel by English writer Michael Coatesworth. A prolific short fictional and pastoral essayist in his own right, Mr. Coatesworth, or 'Mike,' as he prefers to be called by readers and critics alike, has made a logical and hard-bought evolution as a writer.His short story romance / Adventure is in the finest tradition of the genre. This is one of those rare works that deserves the title 'Inspirational.' An outstanding novel and we look forward to more from Michael Coatesworth.Jack Hargreaves."
1,Be careful,"I'm extremely disappointed in this product, the company, and ""service"". Within 1 month of receiving the TV, the picture went bad. It had the appearance of looking at a negative in color. I called the company who seemed less than interested in helping resolve the problem. The best they could do is send me to an authorized service center. Closest one is 60 miles from my house. They never offered to send me a new one and let me return the old one. So, I take it to the ASC. More than 2 weeks later, I'm told the panel is bad and they'll have to send it to the Funai Corporation and its going to take a month or more to get a new one back. Now I've been out a television for over 2 months, and it was ""Brand New"".I will never buy Sylvania again and thought it important to let others be aware of their sloppy product and inefficient warranty terms."
3,A little troublesome,"Seller failed to indicate that the TV stand had been removed. In order to re-install it, we needed to down load directions from the manufacturer, which involved taking apart the TV screen. Once the stand was installed, the TV runs perfectly."
2,Boring and No Point,"The best thing about this movie was Tracy Morgan, everyone else in here can not act past a sitcom.Ok, so what you turned 30, so did I but I did not go through this nosense and nobody else I knew did either. This movie was the only depressing thing about turning 30.Later!!!!"
4,Not Just An Urban Comedy,"This movie is really good, I was pleasantly surprised after I saw it in NY. Its for everyone not just people of color."
5,Real Life,I enjoy this movie because it reminded me of my life when I was in my thirties. This is one of the those movies that I watch over and over again. The cast is great. The story line is great. I enjoy seeing black people who are successful and beautiful.
5,"Wonderfully Funny, down to Earth, keeping it Real...","When feeling sad, due to passing away of my oldest Brother. I can pull out this dvd movie and lol lol lol. My spirit,body,soul is lifted up in a Excellent way. I have watch it a while ago on cable. Finally purchase it in October 2011, in very Good condition, way better then order from Barns&Noble.Amazon NEW dvd waiting for my Third party order is Excellent. Arrive with the dvd box seal up.Bad experience with Barns& Noble third party ordering it NEW & USE, there dvd container was not seal up and dvd in a bad condition.Will continue purchasing from Amazon...."
5,Very Funny Comedy!,"I really enjoyed this movie! The movie deals with real life issues with relationships, life, and love. I am 27 and I am approaching that 30 year old mark and I can definitely identify with the movie 110%. I can watch this movie over and over and not get bored. I would recommend this movie because it is a great entertaining and romantic comedy!!! Two thumbs up!"
5,9 months & 21 days....,"... & 30 and I will meet face to face! I loved films where the characters relate to you & friends. I am Natalie 100%. I have traveled down her path & felt her pain! I also know a ""Joy"" (she just got married after being with her boyfriend for about 15 years, granted some of those years were junior high & high school!), a Malik (damn him!) & a Stephanie (working from the outside in vs. the inside out). I cannot wait to purchase the accompanying book - 100 things you should know before turning 30. Check out the 30yearstolife.com site for teh exact title. I will ""pull a Natalie"" when I turn 30, but I know that I am in great company!"
3,"Enjoyable, but not a classic","I was looking for a evening of distraction, nothing heavy. THE WITCHES OF OZ was a good choice. Yes, the acting is a little campy, and the special effects budget was shorted; but the basic storyline was enjoyable. There were gaps and flashbacks after the fact that did not add to the smoothness of the story, but I enjoyed it. Younger kids will not be thrown off by the battles scenes as little gory is evident. Just sit back and let your mind wander as the story unfolds."
3,It's like watching a television serious.....,This movie is not a major Hollywood production! It's more like watching a weekly television serious! It reminds me of ABC's Once Upon a Time! Children will not relate to this film and adults may be amused! The Wizard of Oz (1939) is just one movie that can not be messed with!
3,The Witches of Oz,"This movie isn't perfect, but it has a lot going for it. It is nearly three hours long, but that's because it's an edited version of a two-part mini-series that aired in the United Kingdom. So, the editing causes the story to be a little hard to follow in the middle.Acting: 7/10Special Effects: 6/10Story: 8/10Costumes/Make-up: 7/10Editing: 6/10TOTAL: 34/50 (68% D)There is a theatrical cut of the movie (re-named ""Dorothy and the Witches of Oz"") that's being released in select U.S. theaters as well, and it's a big improvement on this version. The theatrical cut is an hour shorter, has improved visual effects, and fifteen minutes of added footage. The editing and sound is much better in that version, too. So, if you weren't satisfied with this version, I can assure you that the theatrical is much better and easier to sit through."
2,Dissapointment in Oz,"Had great hopes for this movie--but someone shoulda turned the flying monkeys on this production.The basic movie might be entertaining for children but to scary for them. For adults it was a total disaster! Someone should have fired the costume designer, one character looked like she ws wearing a bath mat for a cape! A scene of the flying monkey's attacking New York, that could have been the hilight of the movie, got ruined with a dragon flying around. A dragon? In OZ? Oh and TOTO is a german shepard. Hello? A good idea, that went totally wrong! Save you're money and don't buy it!"
1,B-O-R-I-N-G-.,"Ugh. Great stars but how wrong they turned...with a poor director. Acting is weird and stiff and I just didn't get the ""plot""...Very confusing."
3,The witches of oz,Its a twist to the original movie. It could have been written better. Dorothy should have been a little bit younger and not so sexy. Thats not for children.
5,Witches of Oz,"This movie has a lot of bad reviews on amazon, but on iTunes it has gone over a lot better so I decided to purchase and watch it. If you can handle the story line of The Wizard of Oz to be changed a little more than other twists have, than you will love this movie! I will definitely be re-watching it because it has such an intricate plot line and I am highly intrigued! Take a chance on it because you may just happen to love it."
1,"Man, this was bad.","I was surprised at how bad this movie was. Choose your criteria and they will all come up bad.Really poor acting consistent with the junky TV series, shorts and D-level movies that fill out the actors other film credits.Disjointed, jump around editing and directing producing a story that seemed like a bunch of half hour TV series patched together.Writing and script of a modern day Dorothy showing up at a farm house with a magical key to save Oz from the bad witches was a boring and too frequently copied plot line found in many fantasy movies. Dialogue was written by the students in a high school drama class.A couple of cheap CGI effects of swirling air to represent Dorothy escaping Oz and of a tornado and some '60s era zapping effect from the witch's wand - that's it."
3,"Decent, but a little disappointing","I wish I could share the enthusiasm some of the other reviews have, but I found this book somewhat disappointing. There are some interesting shots, yes, but many of them are stock photos you've already seen if you own earlier books on the subject. I also would have preferred less shots of scenes that haven't changed from then to now. Additionally, all the ""now"" pictures were taken in the summer, so in many instances trees obscure almost the entirety of what the photographer means to showcase. What's the point of that? Why not wait a few months so that the scene is visible? It exemplifies the somewhat slapdash feel of this book."
4,Just what it says....,This book links historic photos of Brooklyn landmarks with modern (color) views. The historic images are well-chosen and most of the modern shots match them point-for-point. The concise commentary highlights similarities and differences.A useful and illuminating guide to history in the County of Kings.
3,Nice book,"This was a nice book which showed some interesting shots of Brooklyn in earlier times alongside more recent shots, sort of like Douglas LeVere's retrospective of Berenice Abbott's 'Changing New York'. I guess I expected a little more from the book. Not that it wasn't good; it just seems incomplete, like there should have been more. The book is more of an appetizer than an entree. The author should have teamed up with Brian Merlis to recreate some of the images from his books. But if you're looking for an overview of how Brooklyn has changed over the past 100 years, this is a decent place to start."
2,Great until the last 50 pages.,"I was drawn to this novel both by my great enjoyment of Collins's ""The Woman in White"" and its characters, as well as a long interest in the art of J.M.W. Turner. The novel is atmospheric, suspenseful, and fascinating. If I had stopped reading prior to reaching the resolution that Wilson creates for the mystery of Turner's life that turns into an obsession for Walter Hartright, I'd have been tempted to give this book 4 or even 5 stars. But the events of the final chapters left me feeling betrayed and literally turned my stomach.Perhaps it is naive of me to think that, when an author employs characters created by another--particularly from an acknowledged classic--he owes them a certain degree of respect. I see little appeal in deliberately degrading them or making them depraved, regardless of how logically the case for this is built up.For a more pleasant, lighthearted novel reviving classic characters, the reader might try Jasper Fforde's ""The Eyre Affair"", instead."
2,Disappointing,"I enjoy novels set in 19th century England and I have read Turners biography so I assumed I would find this an interesting story.While the author is a good writer and his descriptions of Turners paintings are at times breathtaking ,the book was very dark and slow moving.Eventually I lost interest in what the dark clue was and I was unable to make it to the end of the novel.Instead I took out my book of Turners paintings and spent an enjoyable afternoon admiring his work."
2,The Dark Clue disappoints,"I read ""The Dark Clue"" after reading a glowing review of the book saying how true it was to the Wilkie Collins' novel it is based on. However, as well done as it is depicting that time period the ending betrays and abandons the Collins characters with its ending. I found ""The Dark Clue"" a bitter disappointment in its final chapters after enjoying so much all other parts of it."
3,For Anglophiles only,"This novel is composed of a series of letters and diary entries concerning one man's research into the background of the 19th century English painter J.M.W. Turner, in preparation for writing a biography. The story develops very slowly; much of the material is about the small events of everyday life, unconnected to the mystery. Most readers will find themselves flipping pages to look for some sort of action, or at least meaningful clues. The revelations that appear after three hundred pages are not worth the wait for anyone without a deep interest in, and knowledge of, English cultural history."
4,Suprisingly curious,"I expected to hate this cd,being a Cher fan. I thought it a curiously energetic paen to the notorious Cher.The tracks are energetic dancable and well produced. Do not buy this if you believe it's Cher herself.Jimmy James does a job unparalled in his 2 cd tribute.It does make you wish it was Cher because it captures her vocal mannerisms so well."
2,She's Come A Long Way,"This is a Kylie-in-Concert DVD that is strictly for die-hard fans. The DVD runs about an hour in length and features Kylie sometimes singing, sometimes lip synching (and sometimes forgeting to), and bucking across the stage in truly atrocious outfits (it was 1990) during her first ever world tour. The backstage antics (of which there are plenty) are cute and slightly reminescent of an article in 'Smash Hits'. The actual concert feature modest production values and Kylie is backed by cheesy dancers with jazz hands permantly splayed, but Kylie, as always, is adorable and having a great time right along with the audience. Watch this DVD, then pop in 'On a Night Like This-Live in Sydney' followed by 'Kylie Fever 2002' just to see how far the impossible princess of pop has come."
2,"A Young, Unpolished Kylie Performance","I would recommend this DVD only for those loyal fans looking to complete their collections. The most important ""flaw"" about this concert is that it is lip-synched. And, as another reviewer pointed out, sometimes she forgets to. The sound quality is mediocre, as is the level of audience enthusiasm. On top of that, Kylie doesn't have anywhere near the energy or polish onstage that she has today. The choreography is very basic and not very inventive. The show just isn't very fun to watch. I would highly recommend purchasing her other 3 concert DVDs before this one. They are much more reprsentative of the modern day Kylie Minogue experience."

4,American Ruins,This book arrived on time as described.....I haven't read it because I gave it as a gift. The person who received it was pleased but I haven't heard anything else about it. Thanks.
5,The best landscape photographer in the world,"This is the book for people who didn't think that they liked landscape photography. MacKenzie takes you through a voyage to the abandoned worlds of farms, schools and other building in the middle of the nowhere lands of midwestern America. Here we find that ruined farmhouse, strangely sculpted by the winds and snow of many winters, but not depicted as some quaint, picturesque image, but as a stark vision in long Puritan panoramic views that work to make the landscapes appear as through they are suspended in time, a strange reminder of once active places, now abandoned and ruined, but notheless spectacular in their setting. This is the photographer that will make you throw away your Nan Goldins and your Cindy Shermans and discover what is it that makes photography the newest vibrant member of the visual fine arts."
5,Great Album,Great country singer. Great country album. Seminole Wind is a very moving and enjoybale song. One of my all time favorites. If you haven't heard the song you should get this album. I think you will enjoy it as much as I do.
4,Good traditional country,"This is a good, strong 1992 country album by John, in the traditional style. He has a wonderful voice that really takes you inside the songs. ""When it comes to you"" was written by Mark Knopfler, and Mark even lends his guitar playing to the track. It's one of the best songs on the album in my opinion, although there is certainly no bad song on here. This album would be a good choice for any fan of country music."
5,great text,"This text is very helpful with its readable language and diagrams. It provides a sufficient review of basic biology and is written so that one could technically skip chapters and still understand the topics. The text's website and CD provide excellent review tests, flashcards, and animations.However in some sections and chapters, the author has not organized the flow very well, especially the immunity chapters, and the text goes a little too deep for a 1-term college microbiology class. Its strengths outweigh the negatives enough to give it 5 stars."
5,Great,I received the product in good time and it came in great condition. Would not hesitate to do business again in the future.
2,micro,"I can't believe this is the best microbiology text book out there. its just all right at best. nothing spectacular, yet nothing bad either."
5,Frank Hannon of Tesla Fame is back with a vengeance!!,"The debut album from former Tesla guitarist Frank Hannon and his new band Moon Dog Mane, rocks, a lot of the Tesla sound still remains in Franks Guitar riffs, but there is also a raw quality to the music. Tracks like ""You turn me on"" will make this band skyrocket to stardom. Get them on the way up. A definite must have for Tesla fans and an excellent album for new listeners."
2,We had problems.,We had a problem as the spring pins did not fully pop out of their holes. They were returned and credit was given
2,"Not ""universal"".","I ordered these for a walker my father-in-law had. It looked like these were interchangeable and I don't know what brand the walker was (whatever labels there were are gone). The little push buttons don't fit these holes - the holes are a little too small, and the tubes are too long to use the bottom holes (hit the cross member first). Wasn't enough money to return but close only counts in ...P.S. After modifying these wheels by cutting off the 'too long' tubes and drilling out the holes to fit the buttons, I mounted them and they are crooked. Obviously I cannot return now, or I would. And I don't think it is my doing. Nothing I did would change the alignment. Poorly made for sure."
4,"Not actually made by Invacare, but they're good enough","These aren't actually made by Invacare; they're a knock-off made in China. I'm giving them 4 stars because that info isn't disclosed in the description, and the picture on the web site, which shows the ones made by Invacare, isn't exactly what you get. However, the ones made by Invacare at their site cost about $50, and these cost about $13. They're not quite as well made as those by Invacare, but they work well enough, they're compatible, and that's good enough, and the savings makes them worth it. The only issue, as I think someone else reported, is that the holes in the leg extensions that the little brass ""buttons"" snap into to hold them on aren't quite large enough for the buttons to snap all the way in. A few strokes with a round file in the holes to widen them just a little took care of that."
4,Makes the Walker Higher,"This might just be something common sense that I didn't take the time to consider when we purchased this item. We bought this item for my MIL who lives with us. Attaching the wheels and glides was a breeze - it took no time at all. What I discovered is that it made the walker quite a bit taller. Whereas she had the walker on the lowest possible setting in the front and back, I have now had to raise the back up 3 notches (sorry, I don't have an exact measurement) to compensate for the wheel height. It seems like it will still be OK but if you are like me and not considering this already let this be a warning. Otherwise the product works exactly like you would expect and seems like it will hold up well. I didn't notice any directions in or on the box about installing the wheels and glides but installation is basic and straight forward."
2,Over priced shipping,The product is OK and the price is good. the shipping charges are excessive. I will stay away from doing business with these people again.
3,Good theory in government practices... not too dry.,Some anecdotes would have been great here. The examples were sufficient to handle most instances. The templates were based on mainframe technology and some old NASA documents. The author was very thorough in his theory and used great bibliography.
5,Great,Perfect for class. Exactly what I ordered. The price was decent compared to other textbooks I have had to order. Excellent condition. Brand New. Arrived Quickly
3,"Interesting stuff, if you can filter out the less important.","I learned a lot by going through all the ""milestones"" in this book. Unfortunately, there are a few errors. I was surprised to read that Dr. Spencer teaches computer science, as his explanations of some technical notions were a bit off the mark; perhaps this is just his attempt at making the material accessible to the ""uninitiated"". The book was not carefully checked for typos, duplicate information, and even events that appear in more than one year!However, I still enjoyed reading the book. It did help me put some things in perspective. This might be a good on-line project, so that the reader could filter the time line to only include new machine introductions, or salaries, or computer company revenues, or processor speeds, or whatever."
4,Fun Book,"It's not an all-time classic, but our daughter loves reading this book over and over again. Every little girl knows that she's really a princess, just like Penelope!"
4,Penelope is perfect for 3 yr olds in 'princess mode',"We just got this a few weeks ago and it's a huge hit in the bedtime book rotation. Our 3-year old is completely in princess mode right now so she really thinks this book is all about her -- it's really helped her to see that even princesses have to be in time out, that just like her, princesses have to sleep in their own bed, etc. Great book for the young princess set!"
5,Beautiful club anthem!,"Abigial has been around for a while, her previous club hits include ""Let The Joy Rise"" and ""If it Din't Fit"". I liked both opf them, but not nearly as much as ""You Set Me Free"". Abigail puts alot of emtional in what could have been a run-of-the-mill club song. The mixes on this maxi-sinlge are fantastic. I prefer the Andy and the Lamboy main mix. If you are a fan of circuit style anthems, or just good emtional club music, the get this!"
4,A transitional CD,"I Thought Billy's Guitar Island Cd was very good and think this one is good also its just that i see some big names on this cd(MARK EGAN,DAVID MANN,GIL GOLDSTIEN which is fine but the tracks that stand out our the ones with the lesser known players like John Isley,Ken Serio, and Cliff Schimdt.which to me proves that ""Big Names"" don't always give you the cemistry that is reqiured for great music. All in all very good, but i hope Mr Eric will consider using his LIVE band more instead of studio hot shots!!!"
1,Looks Can Be Deceiving,"The costume was not of any quality whatsoever. If I had known I would be receiving what I did, I would have gone out and bought actual clothes to serve as the costume instead. The costume's shirt is a very rough feeling fabric that isn't soft at all. The pants are terrible and have the most ridiculous wasteband. The wig doesn't look anything like what the model sports in the descriptive picture. Steer clear, you could easily put together a costume from a second hand store that would be much more satisfying than this one (and probably at a quarter of the price)."
4,Enough to pass...,This was my only resource that I used to pass the 70-059 exam. It has just enough info to pass the exam as long as you already have firm grasp of TCP/IP.
4,Excellent Supplement to the Study Guide,"I managed to pass the 70-081 Exam 1st time after Using this book along with the Sybex Study Guide for Exchange Server(2nd Ed) 5.5 with only ten days worth of study. Its strongest point, as with all Exam Notes Books by Sybex, is it clearly lays out what areas of the exam Microsoft focus' on, allowing you to emphasise your study on those key points. It did, however miss one key point, which was a discussion on firewalls (covered in the study guide) otherwise it would of been 5 stars. My recommendation: This book, the study guide and a small practice network of 3 - 4 computers is all you need to pass the exam."
4,"An outstanding resource for those ""ramping up"" for the test.","I used this book, Transcender, FreeTest, and ExamCram flashcards to achieve an 833 on my TCP/IP test. When combined with the Computer Based testing, this book had all the answers for those weak areas. If you are in that critical week or two prior to your scheduled test, BUY THIS BOOK!!!"
4,Excellent summary!,"Excellent summary of most of the topics covered on the test! Reading this book before taking the test brought a lot of forgotten details back to mind. I don't remember much about DHCP in the book, so you might want to have a second resource that can fill in on that topic."
3,Just Okay,"This book is fairly practical. The author has to have a hook - organizing for ""right brainers."" It gets a little old when he is constantly putting down the left brainers for not being creative."
3,porcelin just doesn't cut it,"3 mortars, 3 pestles. The largest pestle is the right size for the smallest mortar and there should be 2 bigger pestles. The items are properly roughened but porcelin just doesn't do as good a job as granite. The best Mortar/Pestle is here: http://www.amazon.com/Granite-Mortar-Pestle-Large-8/dp/B001CE1YT4/ref=sr_1_15?ie=UTF8&qid=1286775867&sr=8-15 It's the same thing as the $40+ model. I bought 3 M/P: the granite, a marble, and this porcelin set and the granite one is the only one I use. They make smaller granite ones if you need a small one. The granite one makes rice flour and grinds toasted almonds in a fraction of the time it takes in porcelin or marble."
4,Haven't tried them yet But my Mom did,"She said it works fine I like the fact that you get three different sizes! Seems like all I will ever need, with the three sizes. My mom made her own Chi tea."
4,Nice set,"We needed a small mortar and pestle for crushing Our pets meds. Also I needed one for the kitchen. This set is perfect. We use the smallest one for the pet meds and the other two for spices and herbs. So far we have had no problem with them. Since they are porcelain care should be taken when grinding hard items, such as some nuts. If you are planning on doing a lot of grinding/mixing I would suggest a larger stone mortar and pestle but for a quick grind to activate your herbs and spices this set works just fine"
5,Fast Shipping and Great Quality,"I loved this set when I found it. Most of the other products cost just as much but are single mortar and pestle sets. This has three different sizes that all sit stacked together nicely. This is great if you need to mix different ingredients seperately, or like me, your three year old likes to mash cherrios in the small one while you grind herbs for poulices (the set is sturdy enough that I can trust him with it!). The inside of the bowls are textured so it actually grabs the herbs your grinding unlike alot of the stone set which I've had problems with. The only potential downside is that the largest mortar and pestle aren't huge like some of the other sets so read the measurements before you order to make sure they'll worke well for your purposes."
3,Great for the money,"The is a great buy.I wasn't real happy with the design, though. These mortars are more like bowls in that they aren't deep rounded enough in the bottom and the pestle is too small. I like to pulverize plain or Kosher salt to use on french fries, homemade tortilla chips or popcorn because the store bought ""Popcorn Salt"" is too expensive. I can make my own for less than an eighth of the cost of the store bought kind. The the shallow mortar and small pestle tends to just push the salt or anything else to the sides in stead for grinding it up.I'll probably by another one made out of granite. Marble ones are good to, however, from working with marble counter tops, I know that marble has a tendency to develop faults that eventually cause the piece to fail or break. Granite will do that to, but nowhere near as bad."
5,Wonderful Three piece Mortar and Pestle,"I am so happy I ordered this three piece Porcelain Mortar and Pestle set. I have used all three and they work GREAT.If I have a larger amount of spices, (or what ever) I use the large one. And if I just have a small amount of spices I use the small one.They work wonderfully and wash up easy.And the price was very reasonable for the three pieces."
1,Cheap,"The product arrived at a good time, but once I opened the box, I found the two larger bowls completely smashed and destroyed. There was not a single ""fragile"" or ""handle with care"" stamp anywhere on the box. It is cheap, but it's cheaply made as well. I can't recommend this product."
2,Not for crushing meds...,"I purchased this item to crush pills, as it was advertised in both the ""Kitchen"" and the ""Health & Personal Care"" departments. Since it was billed as being part of past combined purchases which included pill crushers, I figured it would be appropriate for my application. Unfortunately, the coarse surface of both the Mortar and the Pestle would have made it impossible to recover all the crushed medication. This would certainly have affected the accuracy of the dosing; maybe a little, maybe a lot, no way of telling. While this product might be useful in the kitchen, I would certainly not recommend it for crushing medication."
2,May be I got defective piece !?!,"One of the mortars (3.5"" diameter mortars) broke just after a week. I used it for nuts (almonds and walnuts) and hand washed it everyday."
4,Looks nice -functions well,"We go through a lot of pill crushers and you simply can't beat this set. I had a broken pestle but Amazon's no-hassle replacement process took care of the problem. It is made in China and it could well use slightly better packaging. Other than that, it was money well spent and a joy to own."
5,Great Quality for a Great Price,These little Mortar and Pestles are a very handy tool to have in the kitchen. I also use them to crush pills for a son who is currently dependent on a G-tube for medications and feedings. The Pestle Bowls are compact and stack easily together for easy storage. I am very pleased with the quality of this product at such a reasonable price!
3,Nails on Chalkboard alert!!,"The item is nice, but if you hate nails on the chalkboard (or that type of tactile roughness), beware: this product has very rough surfaces that give chills. So, the item performs well but if you can't take the roughness, you should find something else that is smoother. Otherwise, the product is nice and works well."
5,HIC Porcelain Set of 3 Mortar and Pestle White,"If you are looking for an inexpensive way to have several mortars to use at one time, this is the right choice. This is a set of three; 2.5-inch, (liquid: 1/4 cup); 3.5-inch (liquid: 1/2 cup) and 4.5-inch (liquid: 1 cup) diameter porcelain mortars with three coordinating pestles. The price was right (11.99) and the product seems great so far. We have used them for grinding spices and they are easy to work with. I like the ""rough"" bottom of the mortar and pestle as it helps with ""crushing"" the spices. These also nestle and the pestles fit inverted into the small one. It only takes up the 4.5 inches of counter space. They have been in the dishwasher without a problem, and so far have no stains from the various spice mixtures."
1,Completely useless,"I found this set to be useless! It was cheaper than some listed on Amazon and it got good reviews so I decided to buy it but the bottoms of these bowls do not have enough friction. When you touch the bottom, it's almost smooth. This will not grind seeds for sure. You could use it to mash avocados but do you really need a mortar and pestle for that?"
5,great,These are excellent products for the price and great to have around......even if will never use them.
5,seem to be strong,"I got these for my roommate as a gift and they seem to be holding up well for her. I am highly satisfied by the quality of these for the price. Other reviews have mentioned that one will randomly break, but we haven't had that problem. She hasn't dropped them at all, but they're still in one piece!"
5,Excellent White Blues,"I was also drawn to buy the LP from the Phillips sampler. Have loved it ever since, as a superb white blues album. IMHO This is the best sounding of any of this bands records I have heard, or own. Many others feature slightly inferior copies of songs covered better by John Mayalls bands. If you only buy 1Cuby + Blizzards, album this is it."
3,"Decent, but...","I finally bought this book on the basis of all the reviews saying that this was a classic in the genre. Perhaps my expectations were a little bit too high, but this book fell a little flat. It was decent, but just not the classic I expected."
3,He tried his best,"I'm no literary critic, so I will leave the heavy stuff to others. But If you are thinking of buying this book, I would say, Don't. I love LeCarre, but this one is his attempt to do greatness, and it fails. I've read it twice, and have given it the respect he deserves. I found it to be self indulgent and way too long. Of course, there are some great passages and wonderful observations. And we do get a psychological profile of his father. And we have a great bit with an emigre, and their relationship. Fine. But all of this takes 700 pages to play out. Interesting, but not essential. Get ""Constant Gardener""or ""The Night Manager"", both of which are brilliant, instead."
2,Misleading Title,"Ok, I am only about 60% through the book at this point, but it has very little to do with spying or espionage and lots of very long and boring stretches about periphery characters with farcical names like Makepeace Watermaster that have nothing to do with the plot. It isn't horrible (I am still trying to finish it to see if something comes together at the end), but it is far and away the worse le Carre book of the half dozen or so that I have read."
2,difficult to read,"I know this is a very popular author but I found this book very difficult to read.In fact half way through I gave up.I found the plot too difficult to follow and there were too many characters.I couldn,t make out wether he was talking in the present or the past.Maybe I will go back to it one day and try again but I doubt it.I read loads of books on all different subjects but this one really beat me."
2,"Good characters, not much story.","I listened to the audio of this book from audible.com.After listening, I was surprised to see so many high marks for this book. If I had bought the text version of this book, I probably would not have made it half way through.I give this book a low score because because it was not what I was looking for. I was looking for a good story, but there's not much of a plot. As previous reviewers have indicated, the focus of this book is the character development.Indeed, the author does a great job of building his characters. The audio version is narrated by the author. His voice characterations are spectacular.Had I been familiar with the author's writing style or knew what I was getting in to, I may have enjoyed it more. I guess I was looking for a good tale -- a bit of ""narcotic"" literature.If you're looking for a good story, go elsewhere. If you are a fan of the author's work, you would probably enjoy his vocal characterizations."
3,Magnus Pym and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man,"Reading ""A Perfect Spy,"" I was fascinated by the parallels between this novel and that of Ralph Ellison's ""Invisible Man."" If you read these two novels back to back, I think you will see Ellison's unmistakable influence on Le Carre. The connections run the gamut from simple allusions (Le Carre reusing some of Ellison's characters' names in slightly different forms) to reworking of overarching themes (Le Carre treating the conflicted diplomatic relationship between East and West in much the same way that Ellison explores the tension between blacks and whites in America; Magnus Pym's shadowy participation in his own life mirroring that of the Invisible Man's, etc.) But don't take my word for it: Read both novels. Either one alone is worth the time. But the comparison is all the more fascinating."
5,"Brilliant book, Le Carre's masterpiece","The first 100 pages or so of this novel are quite demanding: the time frame is unclear, some characters appear without introduction or context, and the narrator switches from omniscient to first person. The payoff - and it's a big one - comes in the pages that follow. The reader understands just how integral the baffling beginning is to the entire novel.This book is both a psychological and stylistic tour de force. It puts to shame so much of today's ""serious"" fiction."
5,The best yet,This has to be the best novel he has published. What an intricate and amazing story! The fact that it is somewhat based on his personal recollections of his own father adds a dimension unavailable in his other books. Unlike any other LeCarre I have read. Revealing.
2,Me: too dumb.,"Here's some brutal honesty: I am too dumb to keep track of all of the characters and clues in this novel. I had to mark pages and underline things and then kept flipping back and forth so I could follow along. So I'm probably not the best person to write a review .... I probably missed the whole point of it, or misunderstood something, confusing person A with person B, clue 1 with clue 2. Humbling, very humbling!"
2,Boring. Very boring.,"Since so many (how many are the author's shills?) love this book, it must be a matter of patience. For those of you who treasure each written word and languish over each sentence, this may be a book you will enjoy. For many of us, reading The Perfect Spy is like watching paint dry.I nearly gave up reading it, but reasoned that such a highly acclaimed author and book would make it all up for me in the ending. Not to."
2,A Perfect Bore,"I struggled to get through this book and eventually skimmed just to get finished so I could read something else. I was all set for a good spy novel and instead I was left bored stiff, confused and wondering why I bothered to finish it.What a let down."
2,Boring,"I've enjoyed some other Le Carre books (The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, Smiley series, etc.), so I thought I knew what I was getting into with this book. But I didn't. It was incredibly boring. To call it a spy novel is beyond a stretch, it's more of a character study as another reviewer posted. At least the other Le Carre books I've read have good climaxes with nice twists in the end. Not this one. His writing style really began to grate on me after a while. There's no doubt that he can turn a phrase, but the florid language became incredibly tedious. If the hallmarks of good writing are brevity and clarity then he failed on both accounts, but especially the former."
2,Cute Illustrations - Useless Informations,"This books is great in an UrbanOutfitterHipsterCoffeeTable way, but if you're looking for anything beyond cuteness, this isn't the book for you. I ended up returning mine after purchasing because of all the great reviews."
5,the perfect gift for my fur babies' daddy,"This book, while being very humorous, is quite informative. The illustrations are really quirky and neat as well. I know my fiance will love it almost as much as he loves our two feline ""daughters""."
4,Pretty good,"These are some good boots overall. This is my second pair of Rothco brand boots and they are much better than the cheaper all leather pair I had years ago. The instruction to get one size smaller than your shoe size is a good one. Also remember to wear with boot socks for extra padding.Pros: Good support, good look, feels strongCons: No speed laces (takes about 2 minutes to put them off or take them off), somewhat high price (I hadn't noticed the high shipping fee when I placed my purchase)Other: These boots are not insulated. With boot socks your feet won't normally get cold, but if you walk through snow you feel it right away.All in all, I would buy again."
5,WOW!,"Can anyone imagine what it is like to have a disease that is incurable? Having read The Spirit of Lo, I can relate to the life of a family dealing with Cystic Fibrosis. I read the book in one week, and could hardly put it aside. I could never understand why some families go through more tragedies than others. The Detrich family has been through so many and have managed to make it through all of them. They are amazing! Their life, their love, and hope for a cure shines through all. I wish them the best with their family and The Spirit of Lo."
4,"Informative, entertaining, and full of life!","I read this book as a fellow sufferer of Cystic Fibrosis. I began it thinking it would be another sad story, full of emotion and bad news. Not so. The Detrich's are people that have been in the thick of it, and are still there, even as I write this. I had thought that my living in the UK might provide not only a language barrier, but differences in our thoughts about CF. Instead, I found many of my own thoughts shining back at me from the pages. The book helped me to understand the thoughts and worries of my own family, and gave me an insider's look at another family affected as mine is, without being sentimental or sensationalist about it. It is easy to read, and full of thought provoking material, and has left me with a real wish to get on and live my life!"
3,Memorial To Mr. Gillen,"""5th Anniversary Memorial Release"" is a curious release. It cobbles together songs Ray Gillen sang on for a project called, Sun Red Sun, which also had former Alice In Chains bassist, Mike Starr, involved. There are 5 original songs with four of them showing up more than once. Different takes, mixes, etc. Normally, this would be a bit of a sham & a money-grab, but considering the fact that the late, great Ray Gillen passed away from AIDS-related complications in the early '90s, it's totally understandable. Especially for hard-core fans. There's also one interview track, touching liner notes & a cover shot of Ray that shows his rock-star presence. The production ain't great. The songs aren't great. But Gillen's voice is. Fans who know him from his touring days with Black Sabbath & his 3-cd output with hard-rock & Jake E. Lee led band, Badlands, will definitely want this for their collections."
4,Good book gaurenteed to please.,This book is number 8 in the series and let me tell you folks that it is a great slash'em up and die book. While some of the characters are the same I am sure that if you have read this far in the series you have to agree that it is a hell of a good story.
5,GREAT SERIES!!,"This ""Out of the Ashes"" series by William Johnstone is by far a great fictional series that deals with LOT of the current political issues. It's almost scary because this was written years ago and so much of it is happening right now with our government.I've read the whole series through a couple of times, I've collected the whole series twice now and I recommend it to people who like survival type stories. It gives you a lot to think about."
5,beautiful voice and powerful interpretation,"One of my favorite CDs. Tamara has a very sweet yet powerful voice, carrying a lot of emotion and a tint of melancholy, perfect for a lot ofsongs in this CD. IMHO, there are 6 very good songs in this CD, a rare gem. The arrangement is also excellent."
5,A Star is Born,"Tamara recorded her first CD (Gracias)in 2000; she was 16 years old and sang as a star with many years of experience. She has a beautiful,sweet and emotive voice.Siempre, her second record, is as good as Gracias. The songs have been carefully chosen, mixing new and old ones. The orchestra is also outstanding. She sings ""Que nadie sepa mi sufrir"" in a beautiful way that compares favorably to the old LP by Raphael.I saw her in Spanish TV in 2000. She has been singing in public since she was eleven and I hope that she will be singing for many more years."
3,Lonely Planet Road Trip California Highway 1 (Road Trip Guides),I went on the trip with the book and it gives you minimum information. In most of places I had to visted information centers. Better than nothing.
4,Review #2 Lonely Planet Road Trip Hwy 1,"Very informative, but needs more sprcific information on ""Places to Stay"" and ""History."""
2,Disappointing,"I was hoping for more. No pictures. Not a lot of information. It does have a handy little map, though."
4,BACK TO NATURE,"THE BOOK WAS VERY ENLIGHTENING AND EASY TO READ. IT MADE ME BELIEVE THAT THE BEST WAY TO CURE DISEASES IS PREVENTION. ALSO, BACK TO NATURE....NATURAL PRODUCTS AND NATURAL FOODS. SOUNDS REASONABLE TO ME. I HAVE ALREADY STARTED ON THE FLAX ROUTINE."
3,I Take Flax seed oil and cottage cheese every morning,"I have started or I should say added to my daily regiment Flax seed oil and Cottage cheese . I like it I'll admit it sounds a bit different bu8t I have only been doing this for about a month . I found this book a little difficult to read and understand I is not written in the easiest, way to understand. Personally sounds like, Bill Henderson's Book cure almost any cancer for $5.15 would be the better book to read."
3,One for the ages,"This reprint of Johanna Budwig's original, November 1959 lecture is well worth a careful read. But I found it tough going because, at least in the beginning, it entangles her useful and interesting historical findings and ideas with an attack on the food-processing industry of the day, for its harmful preservatives and additives. She's gone, now, but I would have loved to see her produce an update, based on what we have learned about metabolism, cell biology and molecular biology, up to the time of her death in 2003. I deducted one star for the ""entanglement"" and another star because it is out of date. But she is still one of my heroes."
1,Not worth the money,I do not suggest buying this book unless you know nothing about flax oil and the flax oil diet by Dr Budwig. This book tells you nothing about the budwig diet or recipes for anything.
3,Cure All,"Don't believe that any one particular oil is a cure all for life's ailments. There are so many factors - genetics, environment, diet, bad habits, exercise, exposure to toxins, etc., that all contribute to health or illness. Heck, mental attitude and your outlook on life are also major factors."
5,#1 for a perfect date!!,"A great spanish film, very passionate and original in its way... Very, very sexy, and a little emotional too, but in a great way.. I really, truly loved it, I have seen it a couple of times.. Is very exciting!.. How they show the love that all this friends have towards each other... You are going to love it! I did!"
3,Great rack if you dont mind the European rack rails,"The RS954 is an awesome 20 space rack. i have owned one for years. Unfortunately, the new ones from Quik-Lok only come European rack rails (the ones with square holes) so you will need those funky clip adapters if you want to load up your gear into this rack. These RS954 rack stands no longer come with regular american rack rails. so buyer beware, this is the same as the old RS654 from Quik-Lok, that had the European style rack rails."
5,This CD is wonderful - a mixture of Irish and Cajun!,This CD is wonderful - a mixture of Irish and Cajun! How inventive! I'm from New Orleans and I enjoy Beth Patterson's music immensly.
3,River of LOVE by John Wilson,"John Wilson former band mate of the dearly departed Tom Evans ex- BADFINGER.In a U.K. Rock band from 1976 called THE DODGERS. (Which also featured ex-Badfinger Bob Jackson on Keyboards & Vocals after Joey Molland quit Badfinger before Pete Ham's suicide by Hanging,)Now back to Mr. John Wilson & this solo recordingJohn Wilson, Just has a great nack for a good old pop song sparkled with a dash of the blues. What a great singer. At times he sounds like McCartney doing Little Richard! Just wonderful to hear his very powerful voice. This CD tends to be more on the crooning ballad side of poppiness! But listen up this man can ROCK IT as well.Still it's nice to hear a great singer. I hope to hear more of his Dodger/Badfinger sound. John's voice sounds a bit like Tommy Evans saymates! Go buy this recording if you like the Beatles. Badfinger, Paul McCartney then you might just dig his cd ""River of LOVE"" I wish that I could find more of his music.Cheers Paul Power"
1,Broken within 2 weeks,"I bought 2 of these DVD players. They were put in one position on top of the TV or on a shelf and never moved. One only worked with the remote from the very beginning. None of the buttons on the device worked. Within 2 weeks the other didn't work at all. Not with the remote, and none of the buttons worked. What a piece of JUNK!!!!"
4,A Great DVD Player at a Great Low Price!,Sears had a sale on this GPX DVD Player for a mere $24.00! I was looking for a low price DVD player to replace my CyberHome CH 300S. The GPX like the CyberHome plays all my PAL DVDs from Europe and Asia on my NTSC TV beautifully. It also plays other regions DVDs and homemade JPEG photo CDs. No complaints! This DVD player is highly recommended at this giveaway price.
1,Junk,"Worked fine....for about a week. Then it crapped out. Power light would just blink, but no juice. It found its way into the trash quicker than it took to be delivered."
2,Missing stuff,"No Box, took me hours to clean the tape off, and no hook-up cords which where sopposed to be included, and no book."
4,"Handy, sturdy, but feet kick the wheels",i have last year's model and altho i love the stroller in every other way my feet occasionally kick the wheels and on a long walk i unconsciously compensate so by the end i look like i shd be swinging from a bell tower. I love the one hand close/open and it will take a lot of punishment (we used it on steep rocky mountain trails in a state forest) but unless u walk like a fashion model you will from time to time be kicking the back wheels.
2,I was kind-of dissappoined in this CD.,"This CD shows that Chuck can still sing, but the songs are so different that from years ago. There's too much of the heroin habit and not enough of his good voice."
4,A Great Voice,"I like the mix and match of the different musical styles throughout the course of this cd. His voice is still as good as ever. I am very impressed that he wrote most of the material himself - not bad. My particular favorite tracks are ""The Robin"", ""Surrender"", ""Easy to Be Hard"" and ""Wasn't It You."" The intertwining of his daughter's voice on the cd is charming. I also think that cover of the cd is pretty neat too.Though I like this cd very much and I am a big fan, I must admit that my favorites are his last two cds ""Am I Still in Your Heart?"" and his christmas cd. I always find myself playing ""Am I Still in Your Heart?"" before I play this one."
2,"Great voice, not-so-great material","It's amazing how strong and pure Chuck Negron's voice sounds, especially considering what a hard life he's lived. But the material on this album is all pretty weak. And while songs such as ""Living With a Jones"" may be cathartic for Negron to write, they're not especially pleasant to hear."
2,"Have always loved the voice, but don't care much for this CD","I read the book twice and LOVED it - couldn't put it down! Listened to the CD twice, and don't care for it at all. I agree - the children talking, etc., didn't agree with me, either. I got tired of it real fast. I wish he had just sung with that great voice of his rather than try to sound like someone else, almost shouting and straining his voice. I'm disappointed, but hope he does another, more on the line of ""Am I Still In Your Heart"" or his Christmas CD."
3,Disappointing.,"I was very disappointed in this CD. The music is slow and ""drippy"". More of an apology to his family than something for public enjoyment. Not at all what I had expected. If I'd had the opportunity to listen to this before I purchased it, I would not have bought it. I have the deepest respect for Chuck Negron but feel the best must be yet to come."
2,"Spoiled By ""Am I Still in Your Heart""","This CD is merely OK - I agree with a previous critic on there having too much drug ""I kicked the habit"" stuff. This CD is a shadow of Am I Still.. - that was a CD of astounding quality and vibrance. The ""soul-to-soul"" there was dynamic, here it was not as well put together. Chuck needs to get some new creative stuff out - I'll always appreciate his power but this was a ""mulligan""."
4,"Pretty good, actually!","Normally I would not be inclined to enjoy this sort of movie.But I found some of the themes and characters in this one to be quite interesting. I also found that the movie communicated a generally positive message. There were a few things that annoyed me, but overall I got a good impression.This is much better than most of what has been released after 2002."
4,"Solid movie, concept and acting","This movie brings together three critical elements of a successful film: concept, acting and cinematography. Nick Cannon gives a superb and believable performance as an aspiring drummer who deals with demons of not being able to read music in the college setting. Thinking his talent alone can propel him through the music reading requirement is where the movie picks up steam and leaves the station...The only thing I may have changed was the predictability. In the final battle, the champions for the past five years go next to last and, of course, the underdog team, covets the final performance. Maybe a shock to some, there is a tie and the drumlines duel to the death (not really the death, but to determine who the victor is).A nice concept for sure, Drumline carrys the beat."
5,Lots of fun,I think this movie is a really nice portrayal of the Drum and Bugle Corps experience. What really impressed me was the way the subject of an inner city black male maid his transiton trough a Southern all black college experience was handled.............
3,3&Half for me in a Rocky of Battle of the Bands,"this film had a Rocky type of vibe.I grew up on battle of the bands&the truth is most people didn't care about the Football but who won the battle of the band was the true bragging rights.it's long overdue that a Movie on this Great tradition finally made it to the Big screen.dug the Drumming,the Steps&Showmanship.Nick Cannnon did a Good Jobe&Orlando Jones added another part of His Personna to this film.the film was predictable on storyline&a very Rocky like story line but the chemistry of the Band&overall Presentation was Point on.I'll tell anyone there is nothing like Black College Band battles or Black High School Battle of the Bands.it's long overdue.High 5 on it finally coming to the Main-screen&hopefully there will be more."
5,Great story and beat,"Love this movie - the music, the ritual, the struggle of friendship, etc. Teaches some ideals on respect, leadership, friendship and what it takes to make it to the top."
2,Watch the language!,The movies has no problems regarding shipping. It actually arrived early! Be careful if ordering and only seen the TBS edited version. Has language you're little ones might not need to hear.
4,Great Percussion,I guess I'm a little biased when it comes to drums. But this really made the hairs on my arms stand! Great Show!!
5,Great Movie,"I didn't know what to expect when I first started watching this movie. But boy oh boy when it was over I could only hope to have one of my children join a drumlin (when they are older)just so I could watch it live. This movie has a good story line too, but the dumming...fabulous!"
5,Excellent!!,I got this DVD really quick and it was still wrapped and works great. I will definately buy from this person again.
4,"Above all, a great family film","A two hour long movie predominently about black kids at a southern university with no profanity, no drug usage or drinking?Very refreshing. This is a great family film for all."
4,A Year-Round Halftime Show!,"I LOVE this movie - bands at halftime have always been my favorite part of football games, and marching bands make the parades at Thanksgiving and New Year's. This is a wonderful film about self-concept, fitting in with a group, and daring to march to the beat of your own drum!! The extras provided on the DVD add so much more than the video offered.."
4,love marching bands,"For those of us who slogged day after day to learn routines for marching band, practiced religiously to keep first chair and just generally loved being in the band. There are a few too many four letter words for younger children."
4,Movies,"My brother was trying to find this to watch online, but his internet connection made it horrendous. So I picked up a DVD for him."
4,A must have in my Blue Ray collection,"Drumline is a must watch movie. I have seen it 3 times already an I never get tired of the end battle drums, that's my favorite part. I recommend this movie to anyone, it is very entertaining."
5,Great Movie-Great Quality,The movie is terrific especially if you appreciate what goes into making a great marching band.
3,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Drumline should only be of interest to those who want to hear some cool drum music, for otherwise the formulaic plot and laughable moments (he just played on the other side's drum! OMG major breach of etiquette!) will make the movie a chore to watch."
4,about time there was a movie about drumline!,"I'm on the drumline at my high school, and i thought this movie was awesome. Unfortunately it was not really made for drummers and you can tell that the actors are not really drumming. But still, it was well done and does have some awesome drumming scenes and great ideas for visuals. And cool hats. =)"
5,This one can't be beat!,"Fans of Drum Corps International, especially, will find this entertaining. The choreography is exceptional and the whole band is great, although the focus is of course on the drum line. A&T University must form an unbeatable unit out of individual egos to beat their rival school, and the result is a fine film that will appeal to adults as well as young people. The cast is likeable and the music is great. Amazing what someone can do with a pair of sticks. Highly recommend."
1,Nickolodean Star meets 7Up man meets doom,"Few things are more pathetic than Band Geeks Gone Wild. In this utterly forgettable piece of winsome ... , we have a two-note Nick star (think Britney Spears' little sister with less talent) who doesn't have a clue, tries to pretend third row drummers are hot instead of the pushed around pathos-inducing loser with whose girlfreinds football players screw around. The idea that this kid somehow can become a star or something original, or that an Orlando Jones character wouldn't be laughed off any field because NO ONE takes cheerleaders, dancers, or band members seriously is so so hilarious i nearly cried.Lobotomies should be required for the makers of this movie, but I don't think they make microscopes that small."
1,This movie left me speechless,"Have you ever wondered why there has never been a movie made about a championship high school chess team? Because no one would watch it and no one would care. I find Drumline amazing for many reasons. The first reason is that this is a feature film with a subject I could not care less about. Not only that, but when the movie was over I was even LESS interested in marching bands.Another thing I find amazing is the star of the movie Nick Cannon. How does this talented actor keep the same stupid look on his face throughout the entire movie? That is the pure skill and talent of a seasoned thesbian. I think he must be an amazing actor to portray someone who cannot act. Absolutly incredible.The grand finale of the flick has the buildup of a Rocky movie. Drumoff competitions? To each his own. I walked away from this movie with nothing. Sorry, it did nothing for me."
1,"Total Rubbish, It Doesn't Even Deserve the One Star!","This movie had no plot what so ever. Just another mindless teen movie full of ""popular"" hip hop garbage. This is the kind of movie that seems to come off an assembly line, making people actually lose IQ points. If you want an intelligent teen movie get Breakfast Club. Or even the mindless American Wedding is better than this.On another note I have now been acused of ""hating"" because of this review. This is simply not the case. I liked a different movie that was kind of similar to this(only better), called Finding Forester. I also quite enjoy many African American musicians. And on a movie note I have given many movies with mostly white casts bad reviews such as; Charlie's Angels, The Fast an the Furious, Mission Possible 2, The Hulk, ETC.So don't try and blame the poorness on this movie on ""hate"" that doesn't exist. For all you know I myself could be African American."
5,GREAT!!!,ORDER CAME IN AWESOME TIMING. BOUGHT USED BUT IN PERFECT CONDITIONS . NO SCRATCHES OR TEARS.GREAT PRICE. AND LOVE FULL SCREEN EDITION
4,a strong movie for nicky cannon,"I am all about some good marching band music as it is, so when I heard drumline was actually coming to a theater near me, I rushed to the box office.What I watched was a beautiful depiction of black college marching bands and all the drama that comes with trying to be the best. There as a wake up area for cannon when he couldn't read music, when he thought he had the drumline position on lock, and when he was chosing to leave the school for J. Anthony brown's school. All of this is both accurate and entertaining. Either way, the movie was very good and well worth the watch. On top of that, there is some really good music being played by both the soundtrack and by the bands."
4,Excellent!,"This movie should be shown in music programs in middle/high schools. Excellent message about how the lead character disrespects his talent as a musician by not giving it all he's got. This is a great way to show young students what they can do with their band, dance, vocal talents in their college careers."
5,Five Words,"Five Words: This is the most incredible DVD!Even though it has 47 obceneties, it is an incredible movie"
4,Not Bad,"I saw drumline in theaters with my girlfriend, both of us are into music of all types and i believe you have to appreciate music, especially marching bands and precussion ensembles, to appreciate this movie. While the plot and acting leave much to be desired the sole music and marching band preformance of the movie make it intresting enough to keep your attention. There are many flashy ""stick tricks"" that the main charicter preforms that make this movie exciting. This combined with the element of competion that existis between the bands makes this movie enjoyable and stimulating. I would recomend this to anyone who enjoys the preformance aspect of being in a marching band, and to anyone who enjoys precussion instrauments."
3,Good Marching Band Film,"Orlando Jones does a great job as the director of a college marching band. He usually plays black sterotype roles. Nick Cannon, who can't read music, somehow wins a music scholarship at a mostly black southern college, which seems to specialize in 300-piece field music. The band competition in the finale is the BEST. Great field routines, but music written for drum and & bugle corps. Mostly a showpiece for drummers. Lacking great band music, but I enjoyed the drum line!"
3,A Good Mix,I enjoyed this Celtic music album for its far ranging selections and artists. Not your typical list of standards.
5,Exceptional Debut Album,"After seeing Noel perform live in Orlando and South Florida, I was excited to see his first CD hit the market. I was not disappointed!The CD is a blend of mostly original samba/latin and smooth jazz . The samba and latin oriented songs were the highlights of the CD. If you like Bossa Nova (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bossa_nova), this CD most definitely has tracks that you will love.While I liked the CD as a whole, here are the tracks that are my favorites:Track 1 -- Back in 5Track 2 -- Samba in ATrack 4 -- El VientoTrack 5 -- First DanceTrack 6 -- Midnight DreamsTrack 8 -- Sarong BangiTrack 9 -- Last DanceTrack 11 -- Warm WindsIf you are looking to discover a new instrumentalist/song writer I recommend you try this CD."
3,"Some great, some small","There are two lovely, striking poems in this collection of Carson's writing. The Book of Isiah and TV Men are both heartfelt, learned, and touching. The best that can be said about the rest is that they are deeply felt, if not very compelling. For the full blast of Carson's genius, go straight to Autobiography of Red."
5,Amazingly Beautiful Poems,"This book of poetry is purely amazing. It's worth every cent I paid to discover the delightful poetry of Ms. Carson. My favorite poem is ""God's Justice"" which I share below. Buy this book and experience the magic of her words.God's JusticeBy Anne CarsonIn the beginning there were days set aside for various tasks.On the day He was to create justiceGod got involved in making a dragonflyand lost track of time.It was about two inches longwith turquoise dots all down its back like Lauren Bacall.God watched it bend its tiny wire elbowsas it set about cleaning the transparent case of its head.The eye globes mounted on the caserotated this way and thatas it polished every angle.Inside the casewhich was glassy black like the windows of a downtown bankGod could see the machinery hummingand He watched the humtravel all the way down turquoise dots to the end of the tailand breathe off as light.Its black wings vibrated in and out.From: ""Glass, Irony and God"" page 49"
5,Perfect shower gift from Amazon,I purchased this rolling pin for my future daughter-in-law. I wanted to make sure that our family tradition is carried on. The rolling pin was just what I wanted. It was delivered right on time. I live in the Mid-west and retail stores do not carry them. I am glad I made this purchase.
2,Not what is pictured!,Beware that both my mom and I ordered the grooved rolling pin for making lefse from here and we both received the square cut one. When speaking with customer service they mentioned that this is an old picture and they do not have the grooved rolling pin anymore. I contacted the maker Bethany Housewares and was able to order a grooved rolling pin directly from them. It was more money but I really wanted the grooved and not the square!
5,Acoustica: Alarm Will Sound Performs Aphex Twin,"I don't listen to alot of classical,,,,,,but this is one of my favorite cds,,,,,,,,,,and I have most of Richard d. James' CDs"
4,Good introduction to the Crosby magic,"This is a pleasing introduction for those who don't have other Crosby CD's in your collection. It contains his standard hits which have been recycled time and again on other anthologies. Most Bing-ologists will have all these songs in their collection, some of them many times over. But if you are new to Bing, this is an acceptable choice and the sound quality is very good. It's a little weak on Bing's earlier work and it does contain some curious omissions. Yet there are some stellar songs included as well, like one of personal favorites, ""Sioux City Sue..."" adorable!Hopefully this collection will convince you that Bing's vocal mastery was unparalled. Then you can sample his earlier, jazz-influenced work during his Columbia years in the early 30's and branch off into his 20's work with the Rhythm Boys. But for the beginning Crosby listener, this is as good a choice as any."
4,Audio phrase book,I have only finished the first 2 CDs. They seem well done but I don't think that a complete beginner would be able to keep up with the its pace. For a review or expanding vocabulary is seem well suited. For the price I think it is a good deal.I prefer the Pimsleur approach in for beginners. Pimsleur 8 CD version at the minimum.
3,Average,"No better or worse than most of these types of books.If you are serious about Spanish, skip this and spend money on a decent program. If you just want to find out if you have an interest in learning, this book is as good as any. If you just want to learn a few words and sentences, it is also acceptable for that."
2,"Disappointing, incomplete and heavily edited.","With all the claims and hype one expected to be taken on a course in criminal investigation. Sadly this is not the case. The programmes are edited and show only the major moments in the investigation, e.g., the autopsy is not included and viewers get merely a synopsis of the results, little on evidence collection and processing, etc. Save your money."
5,Crime 360,I really enjoyed the balanced blend of all the crime shows that are on now. Also the introduction to new forensic technology was awesome. I can hardly wait until next season's release.
4,"Worth the money, if free.","The quality is OK, but I wouldn't pay over $5 if I had to buy it.However, I got the item free, so it was well worth the price."
2,Does not stand the test of time.,"I have this product for a month now and part of the red LED numbers no longer work. This is the second on I have had and both have had the same problem. It looks great, but don't expect it to last long."
5,Cowboys Scoreboard clock,"Arrived in less than a week, despite the Xmas break, in perfect condition.Would recommend to any Cowboys fan."
4,Steelers Scoreboard,"The Steelers scoreboard is great. Xmas present for my son and he loved it. Wish the outer part would have neon light to make it awesome. At night you can only see the time and temp. Would be neat if the Steelers logo illuminated or like I mentioned, the outer part to shine on the Steelers name."
4,Bon Jovi meets the Scorpions,"Great melodic rock! Imagine, if you will, that the Bon Jovi tour bus collided with the bus carrying the Scorpions. After dusting themselves off, the survivors decided to carry on the musical legacies of their former bands. If this were to happen, I think that they would sound like German up-and-comers Jaded Heart. Great vocals, plenty of guitars, and (Heaven Forbid, grunge lovers) good production add up to a very satisfying CD. Try to find their 3rd album, Mystery Eyes, if you like this one. It's also quite impressive."
5,WOW!! THIS IS SOME AMAZING METAL!!!,"Where do I start? WOW!! This is an amazing album!! The riffs are hard, the singer has pipes comparable to the one and only Sebastian Bach, the melodies are uncomparable. I wouldn't compare them to Bon Jovi at all. The guitar is much harder!! I compare the guitar to Judas, Scorpions, and Skid Row. The melodies aren't really comparable because they don't sound cheesy and over the top. But if I was too compare I'd say the melodies resemble WHitesnake and Firehouse. Germans again on top of the new rock movement!!! Scorpions first, now these guys. THese guys rock. It seems everything gets it's test in Europe first, then comes America. Us, trendy Americans think we always have the music first. It's funny though Europe always is the testing ground. WHat's big over there comes back here in a year or two. WELL ROCK IS COMING BACK!! ..."
3,Juicy Review,I bought this by chance and at a great deal! The fragrance is different but I am trying to like it.
2,Glad I tried before I buyed!,"NM Nicole Miller is an overwhelmingly sweet AND complex floral. On me, it's a lot-o-note mess, and I just can't stand it. It like NM Nicole Miller can't make up it's mind what it wants to be - fruity-floral, oriental, floriental, gourmand. So, I'll make up it's mind for it. NM Nicole Miller is scrubber. This olfactory chaos is nauseating. I might as well be on a carnival ride, at least I'd get something out of the experience.I tend to prefer more simplicity in my sweets and in my florientals. If you're like that too, you might just steer clear of this one, or at least try it before you buy it. I'm glad that I did!"
2,Open bottle,"I must admit that the order arrived promptly. But I was disappointed to find out that the perfume was not sealed (there was no plastic wrap so one could easily tamper with the contents of the bottle). It appears that Nicole Miller does not sell it sealed so I won't blame the seller. My wife didn't like the smell either, after reading the reviews in this forum I learned that this perfume is popular with the older crowd. My wife and I would like to share following lesson with the readers ..""Visit nearby mall or any store that sells perfumes .. try the testers and select the one you like .. then come here (Amazon).. check the price and order it if it is going to be cheaper"""
2,Smells old,I received a spray sample of this scent and absolutely LOVED it so ordered it and received it in only 2 days. That is the good part. The bad part is that it doesn't smell the same. It is stronger and smells like it has aged from not being used for a long time. Then I found you can't return fragrances to Amazon so I am very disappointed. I wish I could figure out how to make the smell better so I can use it.
2,IMMITATION- WATER DOWNED PERFUME,I Buy this exact Nicole Miller perfume the past 5 years and I love it! Ive never had a problem with anything like this in the past. I received it and the color was off and the smell was tainted... does not even sort of smell like the perfume. Since there is no returns (go figure) Im stuck with a bad product and need to buy another one.BEWARE!! unless I got an old one or something since the other reviews are decent... very strange.I gave two stars ONLY cuz shipping was one time.
1,Buying this product is a waste of money.,The bottle looks so weird it has no name on it or any sticker at then end.Without its packing no one can say its Nicole miller's perfume.I have bought one from Macy's its completely different so i would suggest everyone not to buy it.
5,Awesome!,"I found this CD in a search at my local library - I don't even remember what I was looking for now, but I put a hold on it and recently checked it out - I would recommend buying it to anyone who likes Native American music. It was listed in the library catalog as ""rock"" music - I don't see that - but I do see the New Age music style influence, which is okay with me. The drums beat, the flute floats throughout, and soft voices whisper and sing in the background, creating an awesome sound effect! I really like this CD! It would be good for relaxing, even meditating, and definitely has a mellowing affect on the listener. It is calming and good background (if the cadence of the drums doesn't bother you). Some Native American music can get a little nerve-wracking if it is too fast or loud. If you use this for meditation or relaxation, I can see how it could possibly give you visions. I can't wait to try it and see what happens!I definitely give this Spirit Nation CD a big THUMB'S UP!"
3,En la fotografia se ve mejor,"Realmente al recibirlo no me agrado mucho, en la fotografia se ve mucho mejor que en la mano."
1,Extremely small print,This comment is on the print size. You will not be able to read it unless you have a magnifying glass. The print is extremely small. I do not know if I will ever read it.
5,"An astonishingly beautiful voice, captured just right.","Reading the liner notes to GIGI (""world fusion of jazz, funk, dub, African and Afro-Asian styles"") and gazing at the somber dark cover, we were prepared to dislike this recording; but while listening to GIGI something happened: it got inside our heads, reached for our souls, and amazed us.""Wow, this is a real keeper"" was the general response.If you liked the cd anthology WASSALOU SOUND or perhaps the haunting voice of Cecile Kerabywa, you should love GIGI: not so much for dancing or sing-alongs, but for mesmerizing, laid-back listening.GIGI provides an astonishingly beautiful voice captured just right: everything neatly in balance. Highly recommended indeed."
4,If the calf stops drinking milk why am I drinking it?,This easy to read book has good references and makes common sense. It should be read by every health class student.
1,skewed and misleading,"Mr. Oski's book misses a very important point--the problem with milk and modern dairy foods is that we have processed them to death! Raw milk from a healthy, pastured cow (not grain-fed) is one of nature's perfect foods. While it is true that most of what is available in our grocery stores is poison, that is not the fault of the milk. If you want to hear the other side of this very important story, read ""The Untold Story of Milk: Green Pastures, Contented Cows and Raw Dairy Foods,"" by Ron Schmid, N.D. Also, check out my book review for Robert Cohen's, ""Milk: The Deadly Poison,"" which is also a very misleading book."
3,Campy but insightful,"This book is not very well written, but some of the information and insights are good. Worth the glance, but not a stand alone expert guide on the topic."
4,The truth is out!,"I found this book to be extremely informative. The information will definitely make you think twice before you consume any dairy products. The only negative to the book is that a list of alternative substitutes to dairy wasn't really listed except for soy which has it's own drawbacks. It's important to get Vit.D and calcium in your diet but no list was provided thus I was left hanging. Otherwise, the book was very informative and easy to understand."
3,What this book lacks,"While it is true that the pasteurized, homogenized, milk from grain-fed, confinement-raised cows (organic or not) that we can buy in grocery stores is bad for us, this book fails to demonstrate anything about organic, raw, grassfed milk, which is a completely different substance. What most of us know as milk is NOT milk. I highly suggest reading ""The Untold Story of Milk"" by Ron Schmid, which describes the history of pasteurization and talks about the profoundly positive qualities of healthy un-pasteurized, un-homogenized, organic milk from healthy cows eating grass. REAL milk IS good for us. See also http://www.realmilk.com"
5,Great Hiding Place for Small Items,"This holds small items such as keys, credit cards, money, jewelry. It has successfully hidden these items from my family member with a substance abuse problem for almost a year now"
5,Beautiful music!,"Love this song for the piano/keyboard. Along with the lyrics, this sheet music contains the translation in English as well."
5,THE Dictionary to have,I have just recieved my second copy of this indispensible dictionary on Tagalog. Why? Because the first copy is falling apart from so much usage. This dictionary will be well used and valued by anyone who purchases it. This is the finest Tagalog dictionary out there. This one is the most comprehensive that I have found anywhere. I have looked both here in the U.S. and in the Philippines and have not found another dictionary equal to or better than this one. Even my friends in the Philippines were amazed and impressed with this dictionary. This one has been a great source and a valuable resource. You should buy this Tagalog-English/English-Tagalog Standard Dictionary by Carl R. Galvez Rubino because you will not need another Tagalog dictionary nor find a better one.
5,A Must Have For Anybody Interested In Tagalog,"To start off with I love this dictonary. I have used this book for over 4 years now. I used when I lived in the philippines for 2 years and had to learn tagalog. I've been home now for 2 years and still use it all the time. It has almost any word you will ever come across and then some. It gives a list on Tagalog Orthography, affixes, infixes, suffixes, prefixes and others. It has a basic grammer chart and explanation. My experiance learning tagalog would have been much harder with out this must have dictonary."
4,A good product,This is a really good dictionary to use while learning the Tagalog language. My only word of advise it to have someone who knows the language who can help you on what words to use. The dictionary covers many dialects and also covers words that are everywhere from very formal to very crude.
5,great resource,I recently adopted an older child from the Philippines and having this book made it easier for him to understand English. Good comprehensive dictionary.
2,keep your money ...,"Now , before i'm called ""unfair"" , this book is written klearly . OUT of alphabetical order and only , maybe 1/4 of normal tagalog words are in there .a big , huge disappointment to me . SIMPLE common tagalog words no where to be found ....your choice , but i'd say keep searching"
3,Wayne thomas,While this dictionary was useful i was advised by loacal Manila residents that many of the tag words are out moded or not in use.
2,What happened to cut 9?,"This is a nice enough collection of Lorrie's hits, but on the CD I recently purchased, cut 9 is labled as ""Don't Worry Baby"" with the Beach Boys but the song is actually ""Standing Tall"". The MP3 download on Amazon appears to be the same way. Should have checked all the Amazon samples before buying the CD!"
2,I'm Dumping It!,"Previously I had an Oster & I'm ordering another one today. I'm dumping this one! It can boil eggs, altho, without the piercing pin feature of the Oster, two of them split open while boiling. But it cannot poach eggs--water all over the counter, & one of the eggs ran out of the tray & into the bottom where it cooked hard to the heating element. My husband & I have tried three times now to poach eggs, & we are through.If only I had save the box, I would return it for credit...I know it's cute, but do not buy this item expecting performance."
2,"Works Great, Deteriorates FAST.","I bought one of these egg cookers right before Christmas 2009. The first thing that happened is the non-stick coating on the pan started delaminating. Then, every time you would cook a batch of eggs, water would mysteriously run all over the counter. It turns out that the plastic drip ring around the lid (that is supposed to keep the steam condensate inside the unit) loses adhesion with the metal lid because it is only secured with three little dabs of glue, and allows water to bypass the drip ring. One would think that the manufacturer could have figured out that plastic has a different expansion rate than metal, and that they should have had an actual continuous gasket instead of a plastic ring with three globs of glue to hold it on.I've orderd the Oster instead."
4,Breakfast made easy,"This is my third egg-cooker, the first two were made by Oster. The first Oster lasted for many years before giving up, the second unfortunately not that long. The Chef's Choice operates in the same manner with the exception that when the bell goes off you must turn off the machine(there is still water in the machine), the Osters shut themselves off when all the water boiled out, no bell. The Osters were controlled by how much water you put in for how much you wanted your eggs cooked. The Chef's Choice you fill and set a dial for your type of egg. Do I have a preference on that feature, not really. It seems to be quality constructed and sturdy. It is used almost every morning and I think it will be around a very long time. OH, and the plastic egg poaching cups are extremely easy to slide the eggs out of, even without pre-treatment. The metal non-stick cups in the Osters needed quite a bit of spraying and even then were a little tricky to get out in one piece."
1,Very disappointing,"My wife bought one of these about two months ago. We should have returned it, but we had disposed of the box in the interim.The design is very poor, in my opinion. Water spills out on the counter while it is cooking -- because the plastic lip inside the lid doesn't seal adequately, and condensed steam runs down the inside of the lid and out on the counter. Plus, the design of the plastic lip traps water, so you can never get the lid completely dry.There is no auto-off feature. When it decides it's finished -- based on the setting for cook-time length -- it beeps at you, but doesn't shut itself off. If you happen to be in another room, or don't hear the beeping, it will boil off the remaining water and -- probably -- melt the plastic rack and eventually burn itself out.We had anOster 4716 Egg Cookerfor about a year before it burned itself out, but I'd definitely recommend one of those over this Chef's Choice item."
3,Not durable.,"This cooker does a fine job on the eggs, but the handle fell off within a few months of normal use due to the heat of the cooker. Wouldn't recommend it."
1,Lasted 2 Months,"I bought this because it was highly recommended by the reviews here, but I should have believed the ""piece of junk"" reviews. About a month ago, we started getting very runny eggs using the same setting we'd successfully used for soft boiled eggs. Now, they are all hard boiled. If I have to time the eggs myself, I might as well use a pan. I'm returning this under warranty, and will try the Cuisinart brand."
1,Piece of Junk - Don't Buy,"I agree with the other reviewers that have indicated that this unit spills water all over the counter and the notification alert/beeper is extremely faint. In fact, it is barely audible. There is also no auto-shutoff on this unit. As far as I am concerned, this unit is a major safety risk if you miss hearing the alarm and leave the unit turned on for an extended period of time (i.e. overnight) because you forgot to remove the eggs and turn it off.I am buying a different egg cooker and tossing this unit."
3,Chef's Choice Egg cooker,"The directions leave much to be desired ... particularly for soft-boiled eggs. There are no specific settings for sizes or numbers of eggs... just ""hash marks"" for (and between) ""soft"", ""medium"", or ""hard"" and one has to just guess how long to cook them. Sometimes they come out fine. Sometimes not."
1,sorry,hard to control temp poaching poor usually cook 4 minuet eggs in boiling water two weeks trying with this product no luck removing top after cooking allows steam to burn fingers . Clean up cumbersome . Back to old fashioned pot with boiling water .
1,Worked great until it died in 6 months,"The Chef's Choice Gourmet Egg Cooker worked fabulously in its short life. Hard boiled eggs came out perfectly. But then there is its major problem, its short life. Mine lasted only 6 months. I was hard boiling a dozen eggs. I made the first 6 no problem. But the cooker wouldn't turn on again for the 2nd. Its just died, no warning or indication, just doesn't come on any more. As well as it worked, its a huge disappointment that it was so short lived. I will be trying another brand."
5,Awesome product!!,"I knew someone that has this egg cooker and once I used theirs I knew I had to have one. You will never want to cook hard boiled eggs on the stove again! It only holds seven eggs but they come out tasting so yummy!! All you do is put the eggs in the cooker add some water then select how hard or soft you want your eggs. I give the cooker five stars! Oh, and the best part is the easy clean up. All i do is wipe the excess water from the cooker with a paper towel and that's it!"
5,Well worth buying,Since I have purchased the Chef's Choice 810 Gourmet Egg Cooker I have been serving poached eggs more often for breakfast. Not to mention having soft boiled eggs with the egg stand is giving everyone a kick out sitting down to breakfast together in the morning. It is very user friendly plus matching the other appliances.
1,Beeper doesn't work right,"The unit functions properly as far as cooking. The Beeper goes off every minute no matter where you set the timer lever. So it's a bit annoying over this, but rather than try to return thuis thing I use another timer which kind of sucks."
3,Good at the beginning!,"I've had my egg cooker for about a year plus. At first it was wonderful. Now, however, it will cook nothing but hard boiled eggs, no matter what the setting. This is a good appliance if you are only expecting to use it for a short term."
4,chef's choice 810 egg cooker,My husband loves soft boiled and poached eggs. The poached eggs are messy and the boiled eggs waste energy. This cooker makes eggs just right and he loves it. The only problem is it leaks a little but he says it's better if he rotates the top so that the handle doesn't line up with the lower handle. Clean up is easy. I hope it lasts a long time.
2,Egg Cooker,After attempting to cook several eggs several different ways it was not worth it. The cooking time is unpredictable. Also there is no egg holders included as the package is misleading.
4,Eggs made easier,"This egg maker is great for making many hard boiled eggs in the shell, and for a fast way, without the mess for poached.Of course, making poached eggs, you can only make three, which is sort of a bummer, but I understand why, as the size of the machine wouldn't be big enough to make four.The only downside is the condensation build up around the edges and lid can be heavy and so, water spills if the cooker is moved slightly.Other than that... it does a great job!"
1,Mediocre at best,"I bought this because a clerk in the local kitchen store said it was a good product. I doubt he had ever used one! There's no auto-shut off. Water overflows onto the countertop. The results are really hit or miss ... maybe softboiled, maybe medium depending on too many factors for the slide lever to accomodate. I used an Oster egg cooker for many years and finally had to throw it out after the paint started peeling off. Then I bought a Cuisinart; the base on that warped after 3 uses. Then I bought this thinking it was the best I could get. I was so disgusted I donated it to charity and started using the old fashioned method of boling eggs in a pan. Now I see Amazon is carrying an Oster egg cooker. Oh heaven! Don't waste your money on this overpriced Chef's Choice; buy the Oster."
1,Very disappointing,Badly conceptualized and badly designed. There is no auto-off. Poached eggs are cooked unevenly. Difficult to figure out settings.I would have returned this if I had not tossed out the poached insert.
5,Top five kitchen appliance,I use this egg cooker 2 or 3 times a week. It is so convenient. Great when you want a poached egg or a boiled egg. The eggs peel so much better. My husband loves deviled eggs and this certainly makes it much easier.Only one thing I would change and that's an automatic shut off when cook time is complete.
5,Just what I wanted,"I never write reviews, but I wanted to with this product. It does poached eggs, just right. First thing out of the box, no fuss poached eggs. I just followed the directions and the cooker worked perfectly. Very happy with it."
4,phenomenal,The eggs come out perfect and the only thing that could make it better in my opinion would be an auto shutoff
5,Perfect Eggs!,"I agonized for days over which egg cooker to buy, and finally settled on this one. All I wanted was consistent poached eggs. This cooker works perfectly. I start my egg, and while it is cooking I can attend to other kitchen tasks and know that when the timer goes off, my egg is the same as it was yesterday, the day before, and will be again tomorrow.It is super easy clean up too. Before I turn on the cooker I spray my egg tray with olive oil cooking spray. The egg slides right out onto my sandwich, and the tray goes in the top rack of my dishwasher. What could be simpler than that?"
1,BUY the 1st edition for $6 this edition is word for word the same as 1st edition,"I give 2nd Edition of this book -1 star what a rip off I own the 1st edition of the same text and give that one a 4star is not a very comprehensive physiology text but if you want a quick review of the physio is good and it can be read in 1-2 days as refresher.But I have compared the 1st edition and 2nd edition and is the same book word for word only difference is new edition has 146 pages and old one has 147 pages, and this is because they have made the size of some of the images smaller this way more text fit in the page.DO NOT SPEND $19 get used 1st edition for $6 dollars.I almost forgot another difference is as you can see 2nd has a yellow cover still not worth $13 for yellow paint."
2,Not worth the money,"I agree with other reviewers of this ancillary text. It's too incomplete even to function as a quick study guide. Major topics are glossed over and vital areas are missed entirely. A vastly better choice is the STARS Physiology text. The Clinical Physiology Made Ridiculously Simple book is simple NOT as good as others in this series, especially the Microbiology text which is excellent. Med students - don't waste your money on this book."
3,Fast,I received the book quickly. I appreciate it the seeler did not dilly dally in sending it. for that i give the seeler a 5.
2,"Very, very minimal overview-not worth it","I'm in my first year of Chiropractic school and this covered about the first lecture on our section on muscles and the first lecture on our section about the cardiovascular system, and the rest of the time the class is much more detailed. I'd love for someone to give me a recommendation on a text for simplifying the complexity of muscles and the cardiovascular system. (The microbiology book in this series is AWESOME though!)Thanks."
1,Not very useful,"I know it is not a complete textbook, but the information is ""too incomplete"", there is many important stuff left out and so many irrelevant information in it, it lacks order and needs well placed subtitles to make reading easier. The ECG and the diagram on pulmonary capacities is good, but this book is really not worth it. It is possible to find a better choice."
2,Not up to snuff,"This CD is just nowhere near as good as Ian Tyson's past music, such as COWBOYOGRAPHY, AND STOOD THERE AMAZED, and I OUTGREW THE WAGON. For the most part, the songs are utterly funereal. Contrary to the opinion expressed by the horseman, I disagree that knowledge of horses is imperative to liking this CD. I agree with those who don't think the sax works here. There's nothing wrong with taking a risk or trying something new, as a few reviewers have observed, but if it doesn't succeed, call a spade a spade. I love Ian Tyson's music, but this CD is just plain disappointing."
1,"I love Ian Tyson's music, but this CD isn't any good","I hate to say anything negative about Ian Tyson, but this CD is a huge disappointment. His music has never been rowdy, but this Cd is way too mellow and slow--almost dreary. The sax does not work with this type of music. I only find 2 or 3 of the songs to be listenable. This CD does not come close to his previous work, all of which is fantastic."
1,Sorry Ian.,Ian is far and away my favorite artist but this one leaves me flat. His voice and talents are for trail songs but this one is sort of like listing to Judy Garland singing Willie Nelson.
1,Least favorite,"I have listened to Ian Tyson since the Ian and Sylvia days. This is at the bottom of my list. The only song I like is his rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow which I heard at a concert in London, Ontario, Canada. I never thought I would critisize a Ian Tyson CD but this is it. I would like to hear a CD the quality of Cowboyography THE BEST. I would also like to read a Western style novel written by Ian."
4,It'll grow on you,"Ian Tyson is a musical Charlie Russell. He paints a picture of the west as it exists not as it used to be. Frankly, I didn't like this album the first time I listened to it but each time I listened to it I grew to like it more. Brahmas and Mustangs, Lost Herd and La Primera are the best cuts. Give this album a chance."
1,No Originals On This One,"This CD is available on a number of different ""labels"". I bought it on the UED label, same cover, same songs. These are re-recordings of previously released material, and a couple of unfinished alternate studio takes. Please note that even the group name is wrong...it says ""Classic IV"" instead of ""Classics IV""."
2,This may be a pirated CD,"CAUTION, I don't think it is a legit release. If you look at the cover the name of the group is wrong. Look at some other Classics IV releases instead of this one, plenty of really nice legal stuff out there. This one, not so much."
4,I like it.,"It is a little large, but better too big than too small. Seems accurate with tram routes and much more."
1,Find a better choice,We travel to Europe every year and this is the hardest map to work with that I have ever found. It is such small print and it doesn't show the streets easily. Someone else had the same opinion in a review but I thought I could do better when the map came. Not so. I would recommend finding another city map of Prague.
5,My my my..pink elephants CAN fly,"from start to finish this cd had my attention...golden hill just pulls you in and that's how it all begins my friend...songs like ""The Marrionette"" and ""Cinematography"" inspire you and bring you up into the clouds, and ""Pink Elephants"" is a sentimental journey through euphoria...with melodious guitar stylings and slow yet grooving drum beats and bass lines...a perfect blend of piano and guitar...this was put together nicely.."
3,Pretty but too rigid to soar,"The band has sounded less urgent on other releases, although the relatively simple and similar mechanical arpeggios that seem to drive the writing often become a mere thing of dulled shine to admire from afar instead of being the introspective melodic soft-rock the disc's best put together tracks prove."
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"Graphics are an improvement over the previous Hasbro version of Monopoly, but the special features are annoying. Seriously, how many times do you want to hear ""Mr. Monopoly"" exclaim, ""Eighter from Decateur!"" or ""Show me the money, Sack!""? Not to mention the annoying animated tokens or the dizzying 3D ""camera work.""Trades are confusing, and the computer opponents play the game like crazed lunatics. Wait until one gets a monopoly and starts building houses. The turn will take forever, as the elated opponent gleefully mortages everything in sight in a frantic attempt to add another building.I've had two versions of Monopoly for the computer and have been disappointed with both. On the other hand, a $20.00 Super Nintendo cartridge of the game generated hours of fun. The graphics were simpler and the options were fewer, but maybe that's why I enjoyed it."
3,Mixed feelings,"Overall, we have enjoyed the game a great deal, but don't think it lives up to all the hype. The personalized board feature only applies to the board and not to the deeds, making it confusing. And the 3D graphics and sound effects slow the game, while the simpler graphics are not easy to see. For the money, it's a good deal and I've enjoyed it a lot but I would advise people not to expect more than a fun game."
2,Bring along your Vivarin and your reading glasses!,"I guess I should not have expected the computer version of Monopoly to be any more exciting than the board game. It is, after all, Monopoly! But at least in the board game, you are moving more muscles than your index finger! I played this game at a relative's house, and I am very glad I did so. I now know not to buy it. Not only is it very slow, but also it is very hard to see. I needed a magnifying glass to view some of the graphics. I do suggest this game for chronic insomniacs--within thirty minutes, you will be out like a light!!!"
3,monopoly101,The game is ok. The graphics is great. I really wanted the orginal Monoply but brought this by mistake. I always put first timer buyer for the computer setting but always seemed to lose.
4,Wonderful rendition of the original board game,"The Monopoly software really enhances the game. It is full of creative animations and also allows you to play on many different boards based on different cities (I like this feature), and also allows you to design your own board and play on it. However, Mr. Monopoly's commentary becomes annoying after a while, especially his usually stupid comments about what number you rolled. (You can turn this off though.) Also, the board on the screen spontaneously rotates in full 3D. This gets me dizzy much of the time. So if you like Monopoly the board game and don't have motion sickness, you should play this."
4,Good game but requires a fast system,"The Monopoly PC game has a lot of features, such as trading, auctions, etc, but to see the board well you'll want to enable 3D mode. Unfortunatley, that really slows down the game, even on a fast system. Using Monopoly's online playing seems complex and I'm not sure if it even works anymore.This game is good for kids and adults alike, though, so a whole family could enjoy it. Also, when you play against a computer you can select how smart it is, which allows you to select a novice AI, moderately skilled AI, or expert AI. Overall, this is a pretty good game."
2,An unbelievably overhyped game,"I find it amazing that people believe this is one of the best games of all time. I've also heard people say that if you're not absolutely glued to your controller playing it for 100 hours straight, then you're not a ""true"" gamer. Give me a break! As 2D games go, Castlevania: SOTN is a very good looking and sounding game. I'll give it that. But the game, even with all its graphic splendor, is just not that much fun after the first few hours. It's just incredibly repetitive. Run into a room, kill some baddies, repeat. And the voice acting can be best described as ""laughably lame."" THIS is a classic? I had TONS more fun with Diablo. I'm not going to trash anyone who wants to spend dozens of hours playing this game, but I think your time is much better spent on one of the many incredible RPG's available on the Playstation, like Final Fantasy VII or VIII. For diehard Castlevania fans only."
4,One of the best games ive ever played,"Where should I start , the superb music , the sharp 2d graphics the creative weapons and enemies hell they are all top notch. The game is great there is an rpg element that allows you to gain levels: attack, defence ect... The most superb music, all very erie with it's orcastra. The amount of weapons you will get is an incredible amount of swords, plus youll get shields, and capes . The bosses are incredibly huge some take up the whole screen . The game is lenghthly about 20 hours for me and it has a lot of replay value . If i were you I would buy as soon as you see it ."
1,The First of the downward spiral of the castlevania series.,"Well I guess I must be the only person who thought this game was bad. I personally thought Super Castlevania 4 was the best game in the series. Symphony of the Night didn't seem like a Castlevania game to me. Every castlevania game after this one was terrible. Castlevania is one of those games that needed to stick to its roots. Castlevania 4 was the peak in the series with controls, sound, and enjoyment then they wanted to try something new. Big mistake. Why couldn't they make a game that built upon Castlevania 4. It will always be a mystery to me why SoTN was so well received."
5,Incredible old-school 2-D gaming from Konami,"Castlevania: SOTN is an amazing game! Konami has put together this huge 2-D installment of the popular Castlevania game series. This game has beautiful graphics, great play control, a huge and interesting quest, and lots of replay value. Those who miss the old 2-D games of the past will love Castlevania:SOTN. Even if your new to video games and are used to 3-D, you will still enjoy this game. BUY IT!"
5,Long live side scrollers!,"Wow, I've had this game for years and I still can't get enough of it. First of all, the music in this game is incredible. The tunes, with styles from harpsichord-Baroque to harder guitar riffs, match their respective stages (or parts of the Castle) in terms of mood and visual elements. These are tracks that you will remember for a while. The stages are beautifully rendered. Character and enemy animations are done well. The gameplay itself is top-notch... with Alucard wielding his many, MANY swords, clubs, and other weapons, each with different special attacks. The ""RPG-elements"" are a nice addition to a successful tradition - Stat.enhancing items, magical abilities, transformations... This game is extremely fun, and will keep the gamer hooked until you beat it with Richter too!"
5,awesome!,"This is still the best 2D castlevania ever, it's story is great and so is the gameplay! but when playstation games go into the greatest hits, they have to sell for $19.99, and amazon is selling it for 47 bucks. so if you want the game, buy it at some other website."
5,Heltah Skeltah-Magnum Force,"The Heltah Skeltah Magnum Force Album is true example of what raw, hardcore hip hop album is all about. Many people thought Heltah Skeltah would not come out with and album as good as Nocturnal, but they definately prove the people wrong. Ruck and Rock of Heltah Skeltah definately come with it with metaphorical rhymes on songs light ""perfect jab"",""I ain't haven that"", and ""from long beach to brownsville. This album definately worth buying"
3,Good by most standards. Bad compared to their debut.,"This album should only be purchased AFTER the first Heltah Skeltah CD, Nocturnal, which is a hardcore rap classic. Ruck and Rock are an amazing lyrical tag team -- funny, raw, and consistent.Magnum force has several tracks that capture the hype feeling of their first CD, but way too many guest stars (by the way, I hate to say it, but I just can't get excited about Method Man cameos any more), two or three tracks with pukey R&B choruses, and about seventy skits make this seem kind of diluted. However, when Ruck and Rock are on the mic, they still rip s**t up, and if you've already got Nocturnal and like it, this is worth the dough, just be ready for a slight disappointment."
4,Heltah Skeltah (aka Smif-N-Wessun),If you are a Boot Camp Clik fan then this is an obvious must have. Heltah Skeltah (Sean Price and Rock) make a great combo. A classic cd and must have for any true hip-hop fan
4,Two Gems!,"Being a collector of film/tv versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" I was pleasantly surprised when these 2 silent versions surfaced on DVD. Now, the picture quality isn't perfect but both are very watchable and each version has it's little distinct differences from all the others. This would have received a 5 star rating, in my book, but there's no information on the ""Old Scrooge"" film other than it's date of 1926. I can find no info on thos version anywhere?Someday, someone may ""clean up"" the video but I won't hold my breath. In the meantime it's a welcome addition to my collection imperfections and all!"
5,I am a Christmas Carol collector.,"I collect all of the Christmas Carol movies and books that I can. This one was great, I loved it."
2,Double Feature Silent Christmas Carol,"The only people I'd recommend these to are collectors of silent films and various versions of ""A Christmas Carol.""The feature on this DVD entitled ""A Christmas Carol"" has some of the worst lighting I've ever seen in a movie.The lighting in the feature entitled ""Old Scrooge"" is better, but the English in the text shots of both features is poor, and doesn't follow the original ""Christmas Carol"" novel very well. This should have been easy, since all the creators needed to do was transcribe it.Both of these versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" are poor, even for being silent, black and white versions."
3,Better than OEM pads,"I have used Hawk HPS pads on many vehicles with stellar results every time. These pads are also good. They seem to dust less and they are quiet. Most importantly when I need to slow from triple digits I get quick response, good pedal feel and zero drama. I think the HPS pads might perform just a tiny bit better in extreme braking. You can't go wrong with either but if you break 100 daily you might want the HPS. That's what I had on this '03 Corolla prior to installing these ceramics. The HPS went 74K miles even with me driving. Final note, Hawk suggests a specific break in procedure. I suggest you follow their suggestion for best results.Update 6/7/2012: If these pads dust less than the HPS I can't really tell. The dust from these pads is nastier. After thousands of miles I suggest the HPS for anyone looking for increased performance. The HPS pads are substantially more responsive. Although these pads are decent and certainly better than OEM my next set will be HPS."
2,Not the best book for preparing toddlers,"I ordered this book, along with several others, to help prepare my 2-year old daughter for the arrival of her new baby sister. While the illustrations are charming and the text is cute, this book is much better suited for the older child, of the amusement of adults. It simply does not hold my toddler's attention. ..."
1,Overly-stylized illustrations interfere...,"The too-whimsical illustrations and awkward rhymes interfere with communication and enjoyment of what is (and should be) a fascinating topic for my four-year-old daughter (who is soon to become a big sister). For example, she found the green-faced morning sickness picture disturbing and the tea-cup / hiccough rhyme perplexing (as I did). Overall mediocre - it is chosen for bedtime reading very, very rarely. It skirts around the real questions of what's going on inside (hiding behind cutsie rhymes) - especially for the bright-sensitive type kids who are worried about the changes in mommy's pregnant body."
2,Too creepy,"Did the images in this book creep anyone else out? I didn't appreciate the rhymes or the verbage in this book. The illustrations were creepy in a way. Giving an already imaginative child these illustrations (of a happy, smiling, fully-formed baby in utero doing gymnastics and) is only going to disappoint them at the birth."
5,Highly Recommended For Any Age,"My daughter is only 2 1/2 years old and she loves to hear the story over and over. She points to my belly and says she was there and look at all she did. She may not quite get it all now but she loves the photos and if you ask here where she came from she'll respond with, ""My Mommy's Belly"". Personally it's a great way to explain birth without the gory details - instead just the fun and beauty of the moments you went through month by month."
4,Good for toddlers,"Our 2 1/2 year old loves it. It's the only good book we've found that demonstrates what's going on during the pregnancy, as opposed to when the child is already old enough to play with the sibling."
2,Not the best of the series,"We have the whole Busy Day series and this is the weakest of the eight. The others have more 'action'(meaning the characters do more and interact with each other). This one just seems to be quickly thrown together, with no real payoff at the end like the others."
4,"Book based off movie, not the other way around.","This is actually a very well written book. I'm not saying it wins any awards or anything like that.I might be a little bias cuz I do like the Riddick charcter, though. I was hoping this book might shed more light on the history of Riddick or tell us something new. But, unlike other books, this book is based off the movie. Pretty much the movie written scene for scene into a book. A nice read all the same."
4,Not Bad,"Managed to keep my husband's attention, which means it was pretty good! He said it went into much greater depth than the movie, and was much easier to understand."
1,Avoid it unless you're a rabid Riddick fan,"Several of Alan Dean Foster's books number among my all-time favorites, but this book won't be one of them. Little to no effort was put into expanding the original screenplay, which is unfortunate, as the screenplay was awful. Foster would have done better had he not only expanded on the original screenplay, but deviated from it as much as possible. This is ""paint-by-the-numbers"" fiction, the author could have written it in his sleep.This book was written for a quick paycheck. I found it a waste of both my time and money.Avoid this book unless you're a rabid, rabid, rabid Riddick fan."
3,Seen the film?,Different to the standard Alan Dean Foster approach. I can now understand what the film was about.
5,Great Space Opera - May the Movie be as Good!,"Pitch Black is one of my favorite movies, and I've been waiting anxiously for THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK. When I picked up the novelization I didn't plan on reading it until I'd seen the movie. I hate spoilers (and will not add any here)! But I let myself read one page, then another -- and the next thing I knew I'd finished the thing. It didn't read like a typical novelization, but as an intelligent, multi-layered science fiction novel. All right, it lacked character depth, but that's something that really is the perogative of the actors and director of the movie to provide. After all, the book is the fleshing out of a script, and likely an early draft of the script. I highly recommend this book as a book, and not as just another movie-tie in purchase for Riddick fans."
3,Well written version of the movie,"Having seen the movie this book brought the memories to life.Alan Dean Foster writes his own best selling sci fi space operas,so David Twohy should be happy with this conversion of his script.It is nice that they can't get any Riddick II or III out of this,but there are two pre-Cronicles movies that are pretty good too:one an animation.At one point Kyra says: ""I hate not being the bad guy.""That sort of sums up Riddick stories:he hates not being the villain...they have hunted him his whole lifeand he has survived."
3,not as advertised,"Feeling a little deceived. The ad promises a 36"" strip light made by All Glass Aquariums (same as the one I'm replacing) which houses a 36"" bulb and has an aluminum reflector inside. What I received was a 36"" housing with a smaller bulb inside 24"", doesn't have an aluminum reflector and it's made by Aqueon. It fits and it costs less than the one in the local pet store so I will keep it. I just hope that it lasts as long as the one I'm replacing. I just wish they would correct the ad so we all don't feel disappointed when we open the box."
2,"NOT 36""","The plastic housing is 36"" the light itself is 24"" bulb. Deceptive IMO and I will think twice before buying Aqueon products in the future."
1,Worst deal ever.,Cheap flimsy product. Waited almost three weeks and very disappointed. Bulb was defective had to spend another $20 to replace. Never again.
3,Very Different,"I have most of the Nylons CDs, and this one is extremely differnet. It sounds like they're playing with their style a bit on this disk...and leaning more toward rap/R&B than the standard A Cappella sound. This is probably my least favorite, but still interesting."
5,Timeless Wisdom,"""Cry Havoc!"" Ralph de Toledano's latest (and last), should be read by anyone concerned with the deteriorating conditions of the moral, ethical and cultural climate of Western Christendom. In typically concise and accurate prose, de Toledano weaves a picture sure to enrage conservatives and liberals alike. Conservatives because he clearly describes the advanced and accelerating decline of the traditional values we hold dear, and liberals because he reveals with devastating skill the lengths they will go to destroy the remaining vestige of God, Country,and Freedom we have left. Highly Recommended."
4,Rawk with a capital W,"Pretty good stuff here if you're into black metal... While Ludicra stays true to form with ripping guitar, cougar vocals, and a huge double-bass drum attack, the long, meandering songs have a feminine touch that makes them a little more accessible that other black metal. Specifically, Ludicra has a stronger sense of melody than a lot of its dark counterparts. Careful use of vocal harmonies and acoustic interludes that never tread on cheesy pagan folk territory are also welcome additions.Don't read me wrong -- this really kicks ass in a refreshing way. But it probably won't leave you in the hospital..."
4,Poignant Post WWII German Stories,"This collection of 26 of Heinrich Boll's short stories is a great buy through Amazon's used book feature, since it's not for sale otherwise. Most of the stories involve German citizens reeling in post-war Germany, trying to find meaning in and sense of their lives. Of them, ""On the Hook"", is the best; and ""Business is Business"" and ""Black Sheep"" are also terrific. The rest of them are good, and you know you're reading prose by a master. It was no accident that Boll was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1972."
3,Frogs records defy reviewing...,"You'll either think this stuff is sick genius or really, really bad. I tend to go with the former, but they've done what they do better. ""It's Only Right and Natural"" is probably their best, so if you're new to the beautiful horror of the Frogs go there first. ""Bananimals"" has some fun stuff on it, but really doesn't live up to what they did on ""Natural"" or even ""My Daughter the Broad."" Wish they'd focus their lyrics more, though. The Frogs occasionally have the problem of songs not matching up to their titles."
2,Not so good,"Elite Force makes some nice products, but this isn't one of them. The bendy arms do not allow for the posability like other figures. While the snarling teeth make for a cool look, the greenish tint of the head is really unnatural."
3,";Pleased, yet . . .","I've no problem whatsoever with Fitzgerald's Crackup story, quite the contrary. To me he didn't crack up, rather still herein exhibits his brilliance as a writer. My problem is with this paperback version: Type size is much too small,graphic design is not good in my view. So if this publisher can't put out a paperback that a person can read, don't put one out! Jesse W."
3,About what I would expect..,"Not a big fan of his writing as much as I try, and these disjointed anecdotes are a tough slog. He comes across as a very priveledged man who had the the time and money to comment on what is only human nature when it comes to money and power. He never bothers to try to take the next step and think of any answers. He also likes to name drop, "" We had dinner in this cafe where a Rothschild regularly had lunch behind a small screen"" how nice. Hard to like someone who lived the life of a power elite, but pretended to see all thier flaws without ever really living outside the life. Overall he sounds like a man who deeply enjoys living the priveledged life one step removed from any real power and the jeopardy it makes for."
3,Great Title Song,"This is not his strongest album, but it's very, very good. The love ballads are enjoyable, particularly ""The Road to You."" Worth the money just for the title song that deals with the liberating power of forgiveness."
1,No More Buying Travis Tritt Music,"One of these days, Travis Tritt is going to grow up and rely on his musical ability instead of rebel, macho, sophomoric lyrics. Arguably, there's no country singer as talented as Tritt, but there's also probably no singer as devoted to singing for himself rather than the people who buy his music. I returned this CD to the store where I purchased it after hearing the lyrics in ""Girls Like That"" that could have been written by Beavis and Butt-head. What a shame and what a waste of talent."
3,Pilgrims,"The pilgrims on the Mayflower colonized America in the early 1600s. They endured religous persecution in their home Europe. Of course they had the first Thanksgiving. First of all, crappy taste; America at that point was a third world country similar to the Phillippines or Ethiopa. The war with the natives is a myth; join us or die? They gave them blankets with smallpox on them. This is an important piece of history. Overall, a decent documentary."
5,Great action and romance in one,"I was very suprised at my inability to put this book down. I didn't think it was the kind of literature I would like. However, within the first few pages I was hooked. I found myself completely engrossed in the well developed characters and the multidimentional plot. Anyone would like this story. Its a romance, action and medical thriller all wrapped into one. Unlike many other stories of this type, I never found myself getting lost in the technical details. The author does an excellent job of educating the reader about the more technical aspects of the story. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in a great overall story."
2,independent study,saw this workbook in action and was impressed enough to order it for myself.Clear and consise
4,Useful,"Communication is a very broad term and it covers various scientific fields that at the first sight seem to be totally independent of each other. However, roughly speaking, all the fields of communication, be it computer networking, telephony or television, involve converting the data into electrical signals, if it is sent through electrical wires, or radio waves, if it is sent through the air.Being 100% fluent in English and Russian, 80% fluent in French and 60% in German, I can still find a lot of useful information and learn a lot new from this dictionary. Its only drawback is in giving a somewhat shallow coverage of every individual area of communication. This should be attributed mainly to the nature of multilingual (in this case qatralingual) dictionaries. This dictionary contains under 13,000 entries, which is much less than it is needed to give a thorough coverage of the topic. In all the other respects, it is a very good technical reference."
1,Good but a short life span for us...,"Worked on our aquarium for about three months then just stopped. Not sure what went wrong. I will contact the seller and see if I can return it but that's probably a long shot. Very frustrating.Update 9/27/12: Like a fool, I bought another thinking it was a fluke the first time. It happened again after a few months. Do not buy this product. The quality is just horrible. I bought a bulb first, think it was that. What a waste."
4,Good but kinda long,"It is bright and the lightbulb that came with it worked fine. It was kind of long but thats the only real problem, other than that, great buy"
5,Control is Key !,"28 Days to Diabetes Control is a great way to learn more about diabetes and get a handle on your own diabetes as well. Lance has illustrated the importance of diabetes and how one should go about dealing with every-day situations. Wheather you are recently diagnosed or someone that has been living with this disease, it is an excellent guide book to gaining better control of your diabetes (Type 1 or 2). I am impressed with the broad range of topics covered throughout the book to help with the success of better diabetes management. If you have not read this book, go out and get a copy. You won't be dissapointed !!"
4,Truly fair and balanced,"In Balancing Acts, Brinton uses vignettes of contemporary life as modern day parables for understanding the role of faith in daily decision making. In lucid prose marked with a veteran preacher's grace, tone, and rhythm, he offers meaningful examples of many of the daily dilemmas that face believers and non-believers alike. In each case he not only draws a fair, balanced and engaging portrait of the challenges presented, but also consistently offers a framework for determining a healthy response to each. His lens of the patriarch Abraham vs. the prophet Moses enables everyone to see everything more clearly."
4,Christmastime,Michael Smith is a terrific musician and I enjoyed this album very much. It had some variations of old familiar Carols as well as a few new ones that I also enjoyed immensely.
2,Too Expensive,Although this tape includes a valuable message for people with learning disabilities it is far too expensive for a 30 minute tape of talking heads. I showed it to my learning disabled students and they were thoroughly bored and thus not actively engaged in hearing the good things that were being said on the tape.
5,Now That's How You Tear the Roof Off The Bar!,"""The Nighthawks Live"" was released in 1997 as a double-EP combining both ""Live at the Psychedelly"" in Bethesda, MD 1976 and ""Live from The El Macombo"" in Toronto, Canada in 1977. The disc shows the Hawks in prime form, bringing bar-band 12-bar to the two packed clubs. Their version of Little Feat's ""Tripe Face Boogie"" is done with scalpel-thin precision, and Jan Zukowski's bass track is near-unbelievable. Mark Wenner's harp does the ghost of Little Walter justice as they cover Muddy Waters' ""19 Years Old"". The lightning take of ""Shake Your Moneymaker"" tears through a hill-country take of the classic tune with a gratuitous harmonica for all. Never truly appreciated for their work in the 1970's as blues-revisionists, the group has stayed together and has recently released a DVD with Howlin' Wolf guitarist Hubert Sumlin. Please check out their webpage at www.thenighthawks.com. All content copyright www.maximumink.com"
4,The Nighthawks deliver rocking blues in this one,"Another must have by the nighthawks, Their live performances are without a doubt the best shows money can buy. If you have never been to a live show this is what you can look forward to."
2,Not for children,"This toy is more of a model. It is not for children. My son wanted an Osprey for his birthday and was so excited to open this. He was walking with it and fell down. The Osprey hit the ground and flew into a bunch of pieces. He was so sad and we felt so bad that it broke the day he got it just from falling. It's not like he is 6'2"" or anything. He is a child so it didn't really go that far. As far as looking good on a shelf then it's a good purchase."
4,Diecast V-22 display model,"The profile and shape are pretty accurate. The body and wing are metal. The propellers are plastic and can break. The motors do not lock in position, but they can be moved from the horizontal to vertical position. Its great for display."
2,One drop and its gone,"This toy is cool, but one drop and it falls apart and is not able to glue it back. If you are an adult, it is great, if you are a kid don't but it."
2,Broken at delivery,"When we received the f-22 it was broken in the box. We have subsequently returned to the store and are awaiting either a refund or replacement. NOT for play, should only be for display."
4,facliting development attavchments,THis book is excelant and was a great help we will keep this as a reference book
1,Pseudoscience and unknowing consumer,"This book is based on the author's own rendition of science. He cleverly integrates theory and research from several arenas to develop his own, untested, unfounded model of relationships. This is a classic example of pseudoscience and the reader needs to beware. His claims and application of ideas are totally unfounded. How can a desperate parent know the difference between science and pseudoscience? The parent cannot. In essence, books like this just play on the emotions of unsuspecting and needy families."
4,facilitating developmental attachment,"I found this book to have insightful information into this disorder. It was able to give several different views on how this disorder occurs, the reaction, and how to find a way of reversing it. The different views on why children act as they do and how others may react differently. There are a lot of personal comments spread throught the book for you to get actual first hand knowledge."
4,Great boot for the price,I bought these as a gift for my sister and I have not heard her complain about the fit. I cannot comment personally on their fit. They are not an orange shade of red but lean more toward a truer red or even a SLIGHT purple shade of red. I gave it 4 stars because I did notice a scratch on the toe after some wear.
3,Tan is darker than picture,"Tan is much darker than picture showed! It's a very dark brown color. For me the color doesn't go well with my jeans and skirts. Patterns are pretty though. if they're not that dark, i would actually see the pattern. Also get half size up if you don't want to struggle in or you need to wear cotton socks. Returned."
1,cheap make & wrong fit,"When I ordered these boots I was really excited to find a reasonably priced boot with such good reviews. I ordered my regular size 8 and the boots were way too long and narrow. The boots also arrived scuffed up like they had already been worn. The boots were also cheaply made (in china) and the toe was much pointier than appears in the picture. I was very disappointing when I got these boots and promptly returned them.The only thing they might be good for is as dress boots if you have long narrow feet.typical ""made in china"" product"
5,Durango boots,Love these boots! Comfortable enough to wear while shopping!! Would order them again. I would recommend these boots to my friends!
5,Great Customer Service and Deliver,"I was really happy with these boots: basically bought them for my girlfriend (if she's happy, them I'm happy). I read some of the reviews and decided to get them because although my girlfriend is not heavy set, she is a little wide in the shoe departement and that's basically what some of the reviews said.At any rate, the delivery seemed was very fast: I needed them for Christmas and had amazon e-mail them for me and they responded. In fact, I believe they personally delivered them with or through a local company, but definitely not UPS or anything like that. Needless to say, I would order anything through them in a heart beat. Also note, I was visiting Northern California at the time so that may have been a factor, being that I am a Southern California resident."
2,Very strange toe shape!,"Unclear on whether I got some semi-defective boots or what, but the toe shape of these boots is just... strange looking. It kind of bulges in strange places? I was expecting clean lines, and that was definitely not what I got. I'm returning them."
2,Not Too Happy,"I ordered these boots expecting them to be tan (like they are in the picture & description) When I received them I was very annoyed. They are a deep, dark chocolate brown. When I called to tell shoebuy that they weren't the right color, they said sorry the picture is deceiving just return them. NOT happy at all!"
1,Not what's pictured,"Was very disappointed to receive this item and discover that it's all chrome, not white and chrome as it's pictured."
1,Very poor construction,"I was very disappointed with this towel bar. Compared to the Victorian stainless steel model that I purchased earlier, which I considered to be well manufactured this model was made cheaply. The mounting tabs that attach to the wall are very flimsly compared to the Victorian, and the mounting brackets on the towel bar did not properly align so I had to loosen a screw to rotate bracket to get the thing to line up. The bar itself is made of thinner tubing, and the stainless steel finish was tarnished."
1,Out of the box several sections do not work,Was trying to be smart so I checked all the sections before putting them on my roof but that did not help. I used recommended plastic clips and was very gentle with the installation and when I was done three sections (out of 18) were not working ...
5,This is a great CD!,"I love the remake of the song ""Dreamweaver"" and also the two versions of ""I am Woman"". I also liked both the ballad ""Trick of Fate"" and the comedic singing turn by Tori Spelling. I think my favorite song on the CD, though, is Jeff Krassner's ""Love'll make sense to me"". I can't get enough of the CD! I play it day and night!"
1,One track worth listening to - Enter You by Tori Spelling,"I bought this soundtrack after seeing the movie Trick which stars Goddess Tori Spelling. She deserves an Academy Award nomination for her role in this film. As we all know, Tori is talented as well as beautiful, but who know she could sing too? I found the rest of the soundtrack painful to listen to. However, it was well worth the cost for track 8, Enter You, sung by Tori Spelling. Not only does she look like an angel, but she sings like one too. I rate this this cd one star because there is only one track on this soundtrack worth listening to, Enter You by Tori Spelling. But again, worth buying for this one track."
4,Absolutely FANTABULOUS - a MUST HEAR soundtrack!,I especially enjoyed this soundtrack. The spectrum of music ranges from the go-go boy's Dreamweaver anthem (which makes you want to know how the original score sounded) to the comical Drag/Drama Queen's exploration of what it takes to be a woman and then again to Gabriel's soft-hearted belief in the trick of fate that has happened. A wonderful soundtrack that does its job well to go along with a spectacular movie!
5,"I heard an advance copy of the CD, and it's GREAT!","The Erin Hamilton song ""Dreamweaver"" reminds of the original from the 70's, but with a lively dance beat and strikes of a current day Donna Summer....""I am Woman"" is a great remake of the original, and Jeff Krassner's ""Love will make sense to me"" inspires a blues/disco classic that's GREAT to dance to!"
3,Winning look at new broadway writing,"""Enter You"" is a Steven Sondheim-esque song written in ""Trick"" as if it would appear on broadway. The accuracy of the Broadway style is stunning, although the soundtrack is disappointing in that there is no studio version of ""Enter You"" present. (Although the version by Tori Spelling is comically horrible.) The dance mixes are excellent if you go for re-vamped versions of songs that were good to begin with."
4,Cold War Discovery,"I bought this as a paperwork over 20 years ago and then managed to lose it in a pile of unread books. As the years went by I used a LIFO inventory management process and lost track of this book. When unearthed in late 2008 the story was now dated but it was a chance to read a story set in an cold war era that just couldn't be written the same way today.Good characters, interesting plot twists and I feel like I understand the challenges of the Cold War just a little bit better. If only I could buy more of his books for the cover price of $3.95!"
5,You get a lot for your money,"This is a surprising nice workout. You get two different warmups, a cooldown, 30 kickboxing segment, and a 30 minute total body workout on one DVD. What a great buy. Silk's a fantastic instructor. I highly recommend this DVD for those short on time but still looking for a challeng."
4,Fast delivery!,"Very fast delivery. Thebook had a little more highlighting than expected, but everything was in good condition."
1,This Ad Is Deceptive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this book for my class and the book I received is totally different edition than the one advertised and I looks completely different! I shall get my money back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Through the eyes of child,This was required reading for my class. I like the web site that goes with the book. It has sample tests.
1,Impossible to read!,This book has very shiny pages and thin print. It is very difficult to read because of this. You would think that a book about literature would be published cognizant of the need to actually READ it.
4,"Intelligent, raw and uplifting rock music.","I found this band quite by mistake and am happy that I did. I am tired of the heartless music that is flooding the airwaves today. America's Love is a refreshing jolt of energy, with intelligent lyrics and a heartfelt performance by the band.CHECK IT OUT!!!!!"
4,"Fun, fast moving game ......",I've enjoyed this game for years. It doesn't get old. Lost my original copy and had to get another.
1,Insanely Boring,"This game is very difficult to control and it is extremely boring. It may have been a great game six years ago, but by today's standards this one is a definite loser. Save your money."
2,wipeout WHY?,AS with most playstation games its a clone like so mannytimes before this time they stole the briliant koncept from themighty F-ZERO games that really kicked ass THE good thingsabout F-ZERO was the EXELENT CONTROL OF THE GAME the SPEEDand the possibility of destroying your rival plus all thoselovely cars JUMPS TUNNELS and fast gameplay.WHY even bother playing Wipeout then the REAL thing is out there!!!!.
3,the original and in someways the best.......,"Thats right.I remember on the PSX' release this was the game to have.I got it along with my new PSX and I must have spent the whole damn night on it.Today around 6yrs later it HAS aged but incredibly not by much.The graphics are still amazing and bright esp the Japanese track and the soundtrack,while not my type of music is still excellent as far as techno goes with proffessional exclusive tracks and musicians.This also would have to be by far the hardest of the series due to instant stopping if bumping walls.The tracks are amazing,with some bettering the later versions.I say buy it because its real cheap but if you have the newer ones you probably wont play it much due to the amount of time needed to excel at it."
4,A must have for wipeout fans,"The reason I'm still getting PSX games is nostalgia but also because there are few games these days that match the awesomeness of the wipeout franchise. Having played this on both PSX, PSP and PS3 I must say the wipeout games never disappoint. The techno soundtracks are a good match for this type of racing game. If you are like me it will not matter if you get this or the more recent versions, it will be as fun!"
4,"Great application, outdated technology","I thouroughly enjoyed reading this book and look forward to incorporating the ideas into my lesson plans. However, the technology described in the book is outdated. This book would probably hold increased revelance in today's teaching society if it was updated to match current technology/media devices. It is an easy read and the revelance of the book although slightly outdated is still useful with adaptations.Reading in the Dark: Using Film As a Tool in the English Classroom"
2,"Adequate, but hardly pro","I've had this monitor for about a year now, and have found the dot pitch to be so large that I use it only for computing tasks when next to a Viewsonic VG191b. It is my third viewsonic LCD. Currently it is the only one alive. My local video tech says they are not worth repairing.Now that's sustainable! <guffaw>After much searching, I found that Gateway makes some nice monitors and good prices with lots of inputs. They will also guarantee NO dead pixels! Woohoo!"
5,Great monitor!,"I've used various Viewsonic monitors for years, and always found them to be good quality. The VA902b has a sharp clear image, and I love how easy it is to adjust! It saves room on my desk, and saves strain on my eyes and neck."
2,dissapointed,"I bought this LCD Monitor as a present for my parents to replace their old 15"" CRT. This monitor was supposed to be in ViewSonics ""professional"" line. I was really disapointed with the quality of the monitor display. Compared to the CRT, the font was not clear, the contrast was poor and the colors were washed out, no matter how I tried to adjust all the control possibilities. My parents wished for their old CRT back, so I returned this LCD to Amazon, with absolutely no problem at all. For office work, this monitor is not to be recommended."
4,DVD was good,Good DVD but I wish they had the full fights. They were mostly highlights and the fights I wanted to see the most were just about 30 seconds.
2,I guess I made my 5 star pre-review a little early!,"The cover is deceiving stating 30 ""matches"" when it should say ""match highlights"".It doesn't take a genius to figure out both discs should be nothing but full fights starting in chronological order. This way you can review the prior year in proper context. I would've left enough room (appx. 2 fights worth) for a 15 minute highlight reel at the end of disc 2 from fights that didn't make the final cut. HOW people in charge make such moronic decisions is beyond me. I don't have a college degree and if put in charge I could've produced a better reviewed product than this!This is a step down from the past 3 annual blu-ray editions at appx. the same price. Companies should only be trying to improve their products like Madden games. Every year they try to make it better NOT take features away!"
4,2011 best year yet,"Having attended a few UFC cards live last year (UFC 130, UFC Versus Pittsburgh, UFC 132, UFC 133, & UFC Versus Washington DC), there were some incredible fights that I can't wait to re-watch on Blu-Ray. They have not yet announced the fights yet but out of the 13 title fights, a few of them I would not consider the best of 2011 just because they are title fights (GSP vs Jake Shields was a snooze fest, and Florian vs Aldo was as well)... I really hope they revive some of the fights that were on the undercards like Michael McDonald vs Edwin Figueroa, Edson Barboza vs Anthony Njokuani, Nik Lentz vs Charles Oliveira, & Alex Cacerees vs Jimmy Hettes... Tons of great fights last year and I hope they can get it right on this blu ray... with 17 fights left, I'm sure they will"
1,Terrible rip off compared to previous bests,"Its mostly just highlights... The previous best of were great this ones falls far short especially considering the beginning where they talk about ""changing it all"""
2,Weak compared to previous Best Of sets,There isn't much to say beyond that this set advertises over 30 full fights but that is simply untrue. On previous sets there were full fights that played as part of the feature montage in addition to several full bonus fights. I believe 2010 had 40+ full fights while this set only has around 5 full fights. It's a disappointing highlight reel from the year and many of the highlights aren't that great. I was upset with this compilation.
4,GREAT BUY.......... if you get the blu-ray,"The normal DVD of ""best of 2011"" only includes 10 bonus full fights and the Blu-ray contains 20 full fights surprisingly I actually like the highlights because some fights are boring and they just skip it to the important part. And I have all the fights here full(I have all the events of 2011)the only problem i have is they shouldn't of added the full fights of silva vs Belfort and overeem vs lesnar because they end in the 1st round and the beginning they don't do anything. I would recommend this to any mma fan."
1,NOT GOOD,"I was not expecting almost one whole disc of just highlights. This was very disappointing and I feel cheated. At least the second disc had full fights on them, but I will not buy more of these ""Best Of"" series."
1,Amazing Fight Card without the Fights themselves,"This is by far the worst ""Best Of"" series released. Some of the best fights you'll ever see but without the full fights. This is great if you just want a year in review highlight reel but not for real fans. Not to mention the fact that there is a ridiculous amount of ""noise"" in the video. Terrible Blu-Ray quality. 1080I, I think not! I hope the next will improve because this is by far the worst..."
1,Almost no full fights - Worst best of Ever!!!!!,"This is really ridicolous. There are only two Full fights on Disc 1. Only small fragments of the fights. Some fights only last for seconds, and even when a round starts at minute 3 it keeps on jumping wildly. Its unbelievable how they could do this. So basically disc 1 is garbage. Only disc 2 features twenty full fights, but jones epic battles are completely crippled.A huge step back to previous edtions. Do not buy this compilation. They have mutilated all those glorious fights. I am really angry. I wanted to relieve all those awesome moments, this is a clear rip-off. What were they thinking???????????? Sorry for too fast dooming this Compilation but still what the hell."
2,What a Huge Disappointment!,"Unfortunately, the UFC has swung and completely missed on this one. We get less fights in their entirety than last year. This is very disappointing given that an avid UFC fan can only get these fights on blu ray through this Best of disk. It is a shame the UFC has changed course on what was always a great annual Best of release just to, for what I can only assume, is to get more sales out of the event DVDs. I, for one, am not biting on the event DVDs after wasting my hard earned money on this DVD set. Way to turn off the fans who spend enough money on the live PPV's."
4,Family Business,A nicely written story of an intergenerational textile empire strikingly similar to Springs Mills and the flamboyant characters who built their lives and businesses in the 20th century.
3,"Not bad, but may not last long","This is a great toy for a kid who may have a short lived interest in model railroading. For everyone else, it is frustrating to install or operate and has a short life."
2,More work than fun,There are too many night [flying blind] missions. The landscapes and missions are repetitive. Some missions are almost impossible to complete successfully. Mech 3 deserves a much better add on.
4,Great book - fascinating visual story!,"This is a really neat book to look through. I often found myself wishing the photogrpahers would have taken an extra few minutes to try to find the exact spot the original was taken from, but I understand that this is not always possible. I am really glad to have this book, and think the price is a bargain."
4,Good reception area book!,I ordered this book to use on a table in the waiting area of my office. It has been looked at more times than I can say! Everyone enjoys looking through it. It is fun to see how buildings in our city compare to decades ago! One of my better purchases!
5,Conscious loving....,"I was deeply touched by this small, but profound and lyrical story. Well written and developed and, it deals with the ultimate issues of life and death with sensitivity and passion.I too was amazed this was the author's first book...and disappointed to find no others available by her."
2,Short but sweet,It's an unmemorable love story but lovely how she wove falcons around themes of love and death.
4,My First Should Be Your First!,"An outstanding CD. If only there were more class acts like Andrea Bocelli in the American Music Industry! I don't speak a word of Italian, but I don't need to. This is an awesome CD. My favorite is The Prayer (a song I had been trying to find for a long time!). This is the first CD of Andrea's that I ever bought. It won't be the last, I assure you. I should also be your first, but by no means your last. He is a truly unique entertainer. No fluff, no phoniness. Just pure 100% talent. Get this CD. You won't regret it a bit!"
5,Young turks love Bocelli,"This is Bocelli's best by far. The most gut wrenching, no doubt. I fell very much in love with Immenso, which feels very much like the great Eastern European folk songs. A beautiful rendition. What a voice. I also fell in love with tracks 6, 7 and 14, As a sidebar, I went to a music store last evening after seeing Bocelli in concert in Dallas Monday (4/10) and the 15+ year old guy that assisted me almost cried when he found out I had gone to his concert. This guy was listening to The Beastie Boys and immediately changed his stance/attitude when I talked to him about Bocell's concert. ""I have goosebumps talking to you about this"" he told me. I smiled and almost cried on the way home."
5,A great album with a great artist!!!!,"WOW! A great album. I find it hard ot believe that Andrea isn't part of the Three Tenors. He has a great voice and his songs are just as magnificent. I often play this album because it has a strange beauty which just captured me. I especially like listening to Canto della Terra-hey, wasn't that song in that olive oil commecial? Another favorite of mine is A Volte Il Cuore. All of Andrea's songs contain a great deal of passion and emotion, but these two stick out in the album. Bottom line: A great album. A treasure!Un lavoro eccellente Andrea Bocelli!(An excellent job Andrea Bocelli!)"
5,Dreamy music.......,"I bought three Bocelli CDs.......the one that I love the most is 'Sogno' .........I cannot get enough of it....and late in the afternoon all I want to listen to is Bocelli.....the rest of the day I listen to a noncommercial classical station....""Sogno"" is simply the best...deserving of 10 stars....."
5,His best CD ever,"I have listened to most of Bocelli's CDs and besides being a fan of his, i believe this to be his best production. Since i can remember i have been listening to Italian music and this guy is my favorite. Though he does not have Pavarotti's voice, his song selection is awesome and I'd much rather listening to him than Pavarotti. This CD has awesome music and lyrics; its a one of a kind."
2,Talk about legions of fans,"At the time of this writing, this cd ranks #3 of ALL of amazon.com's chart toppers. That INCLUDES Rock and Roll. It's just amazing to me that this opera singer want to be can attain such heights! Nice voice, nothing special. Pavorotti has nothing to worry about vocally. But popularity wise, no tenor in history has ever been so worshipped."
2,Sooo boring...,"What a boring CD! It is neither classical nor pop. Real elevator music. If you want something good in this genre, try Sara Brightman's ""Eden"" instead. 2 stars only for a great voice (too bad it's completely wasted here)"
1,"small, voice, loud admirers","This is a perfect example of a small voice want to be tenor with a bunch of loud noise admirers who don't know the difference between an opera singer to a pop artist. I admit, for a pop artist, he has the finest voice, but as an opera singer, he is tiny, tiny, TINY!!! Not recommended at all"
2,Bocelli meets Yanni?,"Andrea Bocelli is an amazing singer, but what's with the ethereal, new-agey music? The duet with Celine Dion is the only magnificent song on the album. The rest is forgettable stuff that doesn't quite fit any mood whatsoever. An impressive talent wasted on overproduced, commercial music."
5,I am now a fan for life of Bocelli,i purchased the CD SOGNO it is just magnificent. I will continue to follow the career and recordings of Andrea Bocelli he has a God given voice.
3,"Que me hiciste, Andrea!!!","En un reciente viaje a Nueva York compre ""Romanza"". Quede fascinado. De vuelta en Israel compre ""Viaggio Italiano"" y ""Aria"". Puedo decir que llegue a un estado de Nirvana. Ya, dije, no se puede hablar mas de los 3 Tenores. Ahora son 4, con Andrea Bocelli en igualdad de condiciones (y tal vez superandolos) con Pavarotti, Domingo y Carreras. Entonces aparecio ""Sogno"" y, por supuesto, corri a comprarlo. Mejor no lo hubiera hecho!!!. Es un simple disco de Pop, Rock o lo que sea, pero no , de ninguna manera, a la altura de Andrea Bocelli. Cuando se lo escucha muchas veces uno se acostumbra, y hasta le toma el gusto a alguna cancion, pero si quiero escuchar ese tipo de musica, comprare discos de Celine Dion (una diosa!!!),Eros Ramazzoti, o hasta Bon Jovi.Este CD esta muy por debajo de las capacidades del artista. Dicho en ""slang"" rioplatense: Que me hiciste, Andrea!!!"
5,EXCELLENT! HIS BEST YET!!,"THIS CD MOVES MY HEART AS WELL AS MY SOUL. THE SONG WITH CELINE DION ""PRAYER"" IS BEAUTIFUL. EVERYONE MUST HAVE A COPY OF THIS CD."
3,"Not quite up to ""Romanza""","I first came across Andrea Bocelli when trying to purchase a gift for my father. That kind of music drove me nuts as a kid, but as an adult I took the time to listen and enjoy. Bocelli is a true gift from Heaven! His voice sets you at peace and fills your soul with joy. I have 3 CD's of his work and thought that ""Sogno"" was not quite up to ""Romanza"". It's still great to listen to, but not his most passionate work. My very young children also enjoy listening to him, no matter what the CD. I'm still glad I purchased the CD though. I almost got to see him in concert, but didn't know he was in my area until the last minute."
1,"It sucked, except for ""The Prayer""","I did not really enjoy the album. I bought it primarily because of the one song ""The Prayer"". Now I wish that I bought the ""Quest to Camelot"" CD instead, because this album sucked. It's so POP. He has a nice voice, but otherwise, blah..."
2,it's lacking,unlike his previous efforts this one slips a bit.it's to much pop polish.the music is very boring and lacks any kind of energy.his voice is still good though.
2,Puzzling,"I really don't understand the appeal this singer has for so many people, but I respect that he does. The nay-sayers are, of course, right: he has a voice that could never be taken seriously in an opeara house, as his disasterous Detroit debut last year painfully showed. But when amplified, filtered and electronically enhanced, it sounds rather uplifting. I sincerely hope that those listeners who like this will listen to real opera singers (who are NOT amplified, except in some kind of extravaganza like a Three Tenors exhibition); they will be blown away by what a truly great operatic voice is like. I promise you, it's very different. But why not enjoy this, if it gives pleasure?"
2,A mediocre voice,"The songs in this CD are uninspiring. But what really matters is Bocelli's voice, which is small and dry. He's not a very interesting singer and his singing lacks style and grace. Quite a disappointment."
5,beauty of voice that comes across to all music lovers,"God gives spirit to music, and a voice to an angel. Thank-you Mr. Bocelli for sharing it with us."
4,my spirit takes flight,I put Bocelli on and my soul soars. Every CD-every track brings me joy. An addiction? An obcession? Who cares???
3,Quite a Strong Follow-Up For a Handsome Hunk,"Now, Sogno is not Andrea Bocelli's best album, due to its dynamic strength that is too loco for my liking (I'm in love with him and his voice, though, but too bad he's married), but ""The Prayer"" (with Celine Dion) was the most heartbreaking song I ever heard in a whole decade. I'd still like to hear Bette Midler sing the ""Canto De La Tierra""! Mr. Bocelli's heartbreaking voice still saves this offensively anemic follow-up to ""Romanza"" of 1997. Still, where in the world are the Backstreet Boys when you need them?"
5,What Bochelli Does Best,"No, this is not opera, but it's not meant to be! This is, however, Bochelli at what he does best, in my opinion. It's dreamy and romantic, some may say even a bit too gushy, but I love it nonetheless. It's great dinner music or ""doodling around the house"" music, or just setting back and relaxing music when you don't feel like something ""noisier"" or too deep. It feels like Italy, conjuring up pictures of visits to outdoor cafes in the Signoria Piazza in Florence on a a gorgeous autumn day."
4,It's not supposed to sound like opera,"Reviewers posing as authorities in the art of song use up lots of words to simply say ""I don't like it."" Why they feel compelled to belittle the artist and his admirers is anybody's guess.Mr. Bocelli, in his own description of Sogno, describes it as his interpretation of traditional Italian songs. He is not attempting to imitate Caruso or Pavarotti. His style is probably better compared to the popular Italian contemporary style, a mainstay of Italian music today. Views to the contrary reflect writers' unfamiliarity with this distinctive European genre. They may not like it, but they're comparing it wrongly.Bocelli should be applauded for refreshing a beautiful art form in a way that a new generation of listeners -- spanning several continents -- will actually listen to it."
4,Bocelli Triumphs Again!!!!,Bocelli sends a vibrant meesage in Sogno that will shake your body over and over again
4,He WILL be great,"In deference to the art of singing, how can anyone sing ""effortlessly and with such emotion?"" Kim Kramer loves Bocelli, as do I, but emotion IS an EFFORT. Effortlessly emotional is what one tries to avoid... Luciano Pavarotti is still ""the most gifted singer on the planet,"" as ANY comparison of the operatic works of the two tenors will reveal. What Bocelli excels at right now is the popular song, which he does beautifully. He WILL improve, as well. For now, please, he is still ""just"" great."
1,Not worthy of Bocelli's voice,"I'm a great fan of Bocelli and was sorely disappointed in this CD. ""I Love Rossini"" is the only piece worthy of AB. The rest is ""Yawnie""/Julio Iglesio-style elevator music, with a loud orchestra droning and monotonous in the background...sounds like the hum and buzz built into movie ""surround sound"" effects. For the most part, Bocelli's voice stays in the dark, lower range like Rembrandt's low-key paintings. His power seems stifled and slowed, wavering with the effort of restraint. If it weren't for #11, I'd send it back."
3,Disappointing compared to Romanza,"After hearing Bocelli in concert I purchased Romanza and thought it was wonderful. Then after reading reviews on Sogno I ordered it expecting it to be equally as good, but was disappointed. The duets, even Celine's, do not come up to the standard set by Romanza. I would try another CD."
1,Terrible,"Someone wrote that he's in the same league as Pavarotti...please...don't be silly. Sogno means ""dream"" in italian or ""I dream"". Well, I dream that he'll stop singing very soon."
1,Sogno Review,I had Romanza which I really love! But there was only one song on this album that I liked. I donated it to my library.
3,"Okay, but not as good as ""Romanza,"" baby.","I persuaded my home instruction teacher to check who was performing this new work. It was Andrea Bocelli, because I heard his duet with Celine Dion (which makes me cry so much, I don't listen to it anymore) after that.My favorite songs on this unusually successful follow-up to ""Romanza"" (this one hit a Diamond mark, over ten million sold!) are the ""Canto della Terra"" and ""Mai Piu Cosi Lontano."" Otherwise, it's not my favorite work and it didn't impress me, an Andrea Bocelli fan, that much."
1,What a mistake! Don't buy this CD!,"I'm no music critic, but this CD was actually painful to listen to.... Stick with the ""Three Tenors""...Pavorotti, Domingo, and Carreras and enjoy some gorgeous voices that don't sound like they are straining to sing."
4,"Not Andrea Bocelli's best album, but nice enough","I'm a fan of Andrea Bocelli and love his music and recordings. This one is not his best, but it is a nice addition nonetheless to his complete works. The songs are mostly NOT in English, and the volume (i.e. 'fullness') of the sound is not as impressive as some of this artist's other albums. It is a slower, softer, more meditative album and Andrea rarely seems to 'give his all' as far as his voice ability and fullness. It is, however, a well done album that gives another 'side' of Andrea's performance--a more restrained and quieter recording. If you like Bocelli's work, this will help complete your understanding of his range."
5,A Favorite,"I was introduced to this work two years ago, and while my interest in music has quite a range, I've found this to be a favorite and, in my opinion, the best selection of Bocelli. I ordered this recently as a gift for my 20 year old daughter, who enjoys mostly more widely popular music of the younger crowd, and she absolutely loves ""Sogno"". For as many times as I've listened to the album, it never loses it's magic."
4,Romance,"If you like your music nice and low and in Italian, you'll love Andrea Bocelli. I do, that's why I have almost everything he's done. This truly is music for people over 40 who want and like romance in their life. (what can I say except I'm getting old)"
3,LESS THAN ROMANZA,"MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE MUSIC OF ANDRE STARTED WHEN PBS HAD HIS TOSCANY SPECIAL AS A FUNDRAISER. I WA S ENCHANTED BY HIM AND HOOKED ON HIS MUSIC. I BOUGHT THE VIDEO. I BOUGHT THE TAPE AND CD. (ROMANZA). MY FRIENDS ,HEARING THE MUSIC ALSO FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM. I TOOK THE VIDEO TO A SENIOR CENTER AND THEY ALSO FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM. IT WAS MAGICAL. THE THOUGHT OF A NEW ALBUM WAS EXCITING AND I BOUGHT IT. THE MUSIC DID NOT DISPLAY HIS STRONG POWERFUL RANGE AS IN THE FIRST CD. THIS WAS A SOFT , GENTLE ANDRE. OK FOR SLEEPLESS NIGHTS . WHERE WAS THE PASSION? HE SEEMED TO TONE DOWN WHEN DOING A DUET. ON ROMANZA, THE DUETS TOUCHED MY SOUL. ANDRE SHOULD TAKE A GOOD HARD LOOK AT HIS STRENGTHS AND GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT."
5,"Sogno, by Andrea Bocelli","The goosebumps are free in this CD. Arranged and orchestrated spectacularly, it is full of surprises and climaxes. Rythms play with different ethnicities; there are no cliches.Bocelli has never been in better voice. Actually, the album reaches beyond beautiful voice into beautiful soul. Bocelli the musician blooms in this album.If I had to choose only one of his CD's, this would be it."
4,Andrea's voice still enraptures...,"but I liked Romanza better. Comparatively, some of the songs here are too fancied-up, like ""A Volte Il Cuore"" with all its key changes. Nonetheless, this is still one of my favorite cd's. ""O Mare E Tu"" w/Dulces Pontes has the most intoxicating and unique melodies I've ever heard...and ""Nel Cuore Lei"" is one of those simple love songs that you can listen to over and over."
5,Exceptional,This is my favorite Bocelli CD and is as good as Romanza. Bocelli's voice is pure and the duets are a welcome addition to the CD. His voice is soothing and lovely!
2,A just-ok pop singer in operatic drag.,"This album was quite disappointing. A few songs are tolerable, but the pop nature of the production and Mr. Bocelli's surprisingly limited vocal ability were shocking. I admit to being taken in by the many favorable reviews offered up by customers who bought the album. My expectations were high, but the album fails to deliver. It's quite pop in musical nature and not to my taste. In addition, there is a giant chasm between the vocal ability of the major operatic tenors and Mr. Bocelli (I say this with all due respect). I should have been more suspicious of all those ooey-gooey reviews and skipped buying this one. Listeners who prefer strong voices and serious music might consider doing the same."
3,"Sogno is no ""Romanza""","I'm sorry to say that ""Sogno"" did not live up to my expectations, especially after listening to the ""Romanza"" album. I usually don't write reviews, but thought I should if you are considering buying an Andrea Bocelli CD for the first time. If you are, pick up ""Romanza"" first. However, if you are a Celine Dion fan, and I'm not, buy this one anyway. It really is one of the few highlights on the album. Others to include are ""Canto Della Terra"" and ""'O Mare e Tu.""I hope he can get some better songs to perform on his next release. He should also keep his duets at a minimum. He seems to hold back when singing with partners.Andrea Bocelli is certainly a gifted musician. I can only hope he will tour in the U.S. sometime. Listening to recorded music doesn't do him the justice he deserves."
4,More beauty from Andrea!,"While this album does not showcase Andrea's voice to the fullest (my favorite is still Viaggio Italiano), it is still a beautiful collection of work. It is another album that you can listen to over and over and never tire of. ""The Prayer"" can move you to tears. I've seen Andrea at the Bellagio in Las Vegas and look forward to seeing him at the Hollywood Bowl in April. He has the power to transfix you - he takes your breath away and you find yourself on the edge of your seat with your mouth open. His beautiful countenance, humility, shyness, the soft fingering of the hem of his jacket or scarf, all make you know this is a man of special qualities. The man's sweetness comes through in his music to touch your heart and soul."
4,Sogno,"Awesome CD, listening to this CD on my Minidisc staring in awe at the mountains in Marocco...worth every penny and then some.Why is it that there are so many people reviewing this CD and complaining about Andrea not being even near Pavarotti? Does it matter if he is not a Pavarotti? People buy his music and love it,the people have spoken.Please stop this cultural snobbism."
3,"Not real opera, but resonates","I am an Andrea Bocelli fan, period. I also studied voice for long enough (only 3 months) to know that Andrea is no technical wizard and not a real opera singer. For people who don't know much about opera and the technical side of singing, Andrea may be the first step to understanding and appreciating. He is very emotional and I am carried away by the songs and the singing. He has a talent for touching people and there can be no downside to that. Hype and marketing can create some kind of Enrique Iglesias, but no one has to convince the public to enjoy Andrea Bocelli. It is his ""crossover"" thing that has people thinking that they finally found an ""opera"" singer that they like. Maybe they will explore further, and maybe they will just stick to what they know. Either way, Andrea is great stuff for helping us expand something good in ourselves."
3,"Great voice, not good enough songs","Only one song that I really enjoy in this album, only Sogno. I don't understand Italian so I really pay attention to the music and the voice. He has a wonderful voice, but other than Sogno and The Prayer that was beautifully arranged, other songs are as lame as they can be. I hope in the future he can get a better team to work with."
5,Excellent,"Andrea Bocelli has come a long way since his debut album. He has refined every aspect of his technique, making this recording one of his best."
4,"Some excellent tracks, brought down by filler material","First, why would anyone claim that Bocelli has vocal limitations? Because he isn't bludgeoning our ears with stupid songs, which is the reason that we turned off opera in the first place? I would say that this guy has the best voice in the world. If Pavarotti was singing this album, I wouldn't have bought it.This is a good album, although not up there with Romanza. The title track and Canto Della Terra are excellent songs. My favorite, Tremo E T'Amo is Bocelli's best song ever (in my humble opinion)."
3,knew what 'cantico' was about without knowing language,"what an amazing voice this man has but, ah, how much better could his choice of songs be? how much better his execution? i think the duets are merely marketing ploys and the weaker material on cd. also his phrasing, holding notes, etc. prove instincts as a singer are less than adequate. concert review in l.a. times really hits home (Gifted but Terribly Conflicted; Andrea Bocelli meets his adoring public with an area tour and a distant, yet compelling performance, by Mark Swed, Times Music Critic, April 16, 1999) great to see what deep feeling mr. bocelli brings out of fans/detractors alike"
5,Absolutely Fabulous,"I first heard track one of this great CD on a concert on television. What moved me most was the haunting melody and the sounds from the futuristic looking musical instruments. I bought the album thinking that perhaps there would be only one or at the most two tracks which I would like, but I have to admit it is the first CD I have bought in a long time that I can honestly say that I like them all."
5,extrodanarly supberb preformer with divine presence,"andre is the most versitile performer that is on the music scene today, and i expect he will be here for a long time to come. if you have'nt experienced his music and you love music please get a cd and listen to the heart and soul that he gives on every word he sings."
5,Wow! Worth Learning Italian For......,"I got this album two days ago, and I have to confess that it is simply one of the most moving and beautiful I've ever heard. It's almost a cliche to say that the duet with Celine Dion of ""The Prayer"" is great, but when I saw the Oscar performance I was speechless, and this recording causes that same effect every time I hear it....Even my six year old son is walking around the house singing along with this!"
5,a most beautiful album!,"The man who maintains two separate singing careers brings immense joy to his fans with this wonderful album. It has been on repeat on the cd player since first unwrapped...the man sings like a dream. I love the duets, and encourage everyone to drop everything and run out and GET THIS MASTERPIECE! SOGNO IS AWESOME!!!!"
4,Enjoyable regardless of how often heard before.,"Andrea Bocelli is NOT the new (fill in the name of your personal favorite), nor does he need to be. He does, however, create music that is worth the price of the CD and is as enjoyable on its 30th playing as it was on its first. That is something I can not honestly say about most of the drivel that constitutes today's ""music"" scene."
5,Magnificent/Motto Bene,"The voice is glorious, rich, robust; yet sensual. The words are romantic, compelling...the music divine. No matter when or where I play this CD everyone falls in love with it. You can't ask for much more from Andrea, but with each successive CD he records, he brings new people to his throng of fans. Love him--he's inspiring."
5,Marvelous - I could cry when I hear Andrea Bocelli sing,"I happened to come across ""Never Say Goodbye"" - and loved it. Andrea & Sarah what a combination. My friends all had to buy it. We play it at my art class every week. Andrea is the best tenor since John McCormack. He makes me want to cry (a good cry.) Plan to buy Sogna. Keep his records coming."
4,Masters show how it's done,"If you are a drummer, you will enjoy this look at two old school funk drummers who powered the James Brown bands of the 60s and 70s. Both are heard on most of the important cuts done by Brown, and both have been sampled to death. They sit at kits, side by side, and discuss their various trademark grooves. Both show it, too, which is good, because neither one is especially articulate. These instructional sections are mixed in with a few tunes done with the band that shows former Brown trombonist Fred Wesley, as well as newer players, John Scofield and John Medeski. You don't learn much here, because it's more about the soloists than the rhythm, but you see the drummers in overhead shots. This made me go immediately to my drums and imitate the grooves. I own all the Brown tunes, so I played along. They don't do anything impossible, but what they do is essential if you want to be a good drummer. Well worth watching."
2,Works but the signal is bad,"I bought this card in replace my laptop wifi card.This card works well with adapters B and G, I haven't tested yet on N adapter but the signal is bad.With this card I think you get what you paid, as I mentioned before, It works but not as you want."
5,Metal \m/,Harmonies!!!! I love this album. Phenomenal Musicality. This band brought me into Tech Death and are a great influence in my musical journey.
5,So Versatile,"Love this sticker paper. Print what you like, adhere and bam, you're done. There are a lot of uses here. Off the top of my head, I'll use this for:Jar labels""Reward"" stickers for good schoolworkGift tagsCraft projectsReturn address tagsStorage bin labelsBinder labelsName tagsThe solid sheets give you all the flexibility you need for custom shapes and sizes. Plus, the labels have a removable adhesive, something I consider a plus. Recommended."
5,Great for off size labels,"Do you like to make labels? Then you will love this. Essentially it is a sheet of label paper that allows one to make a label of any size. What is especially great about this is it is on acid free paper, so it can be used on card stock and scrapbooking. A wonderful product for the crafting."
3,Good product,"The sheets are nice I've already use them all. The main disadvantage is that the you must be careful with the place in which you stick the stickers, since if they get wet the sticker will ruin."
4,Great,"Works great. I use them as package labels, to save on tape. Good quality, sticks well. I run them through my canonpixma pro printer when I want to use them as labels. I'm pleased with the quality!"
2,I would've been better off buying photo paper and using glue,There is no gloss on this paper at all so it doesn't even look like a cheap sticker. The slits on the back of the paper to make it easier to remove are actually deep creases that show through the front of the paper. This makes full page printing useless. All the sheets in the pack had these deep creases. So I don't know if I just received a defective pack or if this is how all the Avery Sticker sheets are.
2,Disappointing,"While it's nice that you can pull the sticker off if you put it on wrong, the problem is that the stickers don't stick for any length of time. I had to use glue to get a permanent stick. Not going to buy this again, very poor quality. Little more than copy paper with cheap stickie. Too expensive for the quality. I'm sad."
4,Nice for customized projects,These stickers work great for making stickers in your own personalized shapes that you cannot get from the standard rectangular size. I make labels for jars of goodies I give to people on special occasions.
3,One big sticker gives lots of freedom to design but a little unwieldy to shape,"At first I really liked the idea of having these large, 8.5x11 sheets of sticker/label paper to allow the freedom of creativity to design your own stickers. But my enthusiasm was tempered by the fact that I'd have to cut the stickers out--not too easy to do if creative projects lead to irregular shapes.This is essentially one sheet of label paper without any diecuts to allow easy peel-off from the sheet--easy to imagine for anyone who's ever used any of the great Avery products. Just keep in mind you'll have to do your own cutouts. My wife is an elementary school teacher, and she's using the sheets for customized stickers. It's good for her to use. She says her students wouldn't have the eye-hand coordination to anything other than fairly uniform, rectangular cutouts, and that they would probably leave a lot of wastage.Nevertheless, the product is good as one among a large portfolio of all kinds of Avery choices."
3,Does what it says - but this is NOT photo paper!,"This product works well as per the manufacturer's description - but be away that this paper is NOT a photo paper. It is decent for words/shapes/graphics/etc but do not think you will get good color or print quality for something like a photo. The paper seriously soaks up ink - so you will never get a deep black, for example - and all other colors will be off (when compared to a print on a higher quality photo paper). That said, it does what it promises, sticks well, and is a decent price."
2,Not the best quality,"This paper just wasn't as good as I'd expected it to be. It never held vibrant colors well, and I tried on multiple printers. The colors just seemed dull on this paper. Also, the backing wasn't sticky enough and it peeled off of the paper bags I had put them on. Overall, I was not satisfied with this purchase."
4,"Good Christmas movie, not as cheesy as most Hallmark movies","Bought this gift for an aunt, she loved it, I might order myself a copy too for next Christmas. Recommend this movie!"
5,Mrs. Miracle,"A great Hallmark Film. A great movie for the whole family to watch at one time.. This day and age we don't have much family time together, everyone doing his or her on thing. We need to get familys back together once again."
4,Very entertaining!,"I was told this was good, so I purchased it and was very pleased. It is very entertaining. Doris Roberts was very good and very believable. I will certainly watch this often!It was involved a bit, but not overdone, and I think it may be a classic for me."
4,A Delightful Story,"Dennis A. Amith has written a fine review. I will disagree with him on one point. He describes Reba Maxwell, (Erin Karpluk, ""Being Erica"") as 'hating' her sister. Reba was betrayed by the two people she most trusted. I feel 'heartbroken' would be a more accurate description of her initial condition in the movie."
3,Watch it for the house,"I loved the house in this film. My interest was definitely held by the design of the house. It was a very entertaining movie as well. Nothing deep and very predictable but very cute. Word of warning: there is a kiss between the two main characters after their first date. If you are ultra conservative like me and trying to instill values in your children to respect your bodies, you may be bothered by this. I like it when characters wait (longer than their first date) and build up to their first kiss."
2,Sadly unrealized potential,"I bought this movie on a whim when it popped up while I was shopping around on Amazon. We love Doris Roberts as Raymond's mother, and thought it would be fun to see her in a different sort of role. Unfortunately the story was way too choppy and many elements just didn't make sense at all. The acting was average-to-mediocre and it seems the director just didn't pull the characters or their parts together very well. Honestly this film had the look and feel of older movies when the arts of acting and movie-making just weren't as advanced as we've grown accustomed to in the 21st century.The film does get a few points for a redeeming message of forgiveness, coupled with not allowing the past, whatever it may be, to interrupt the present and future. But from a total entertainment and production quality standpoint, this one just doesn't measure up."
2,misleading,"This was stated to be ""closed caption"", however it is not so it is worthless to me. My wife watched it and really liked it so I will keep it."
2,Not so great,"This is an ok movie, but nothing special, so not really worth owning. I didn't return it because I viewed it first and then saw if it was opened it wasn't returnable."
5,Great movie,"So fun, and so touching. The two leads James and Erin have great chemistry. This is a far better movie then Erin K's other Xmas film Christmas Lodge. Christmas Lodge is dull, bland acting, boring, and no on screen chemistry like this one. Mrs. Miracle is so great I must watch it 3 times at least around the holidays."
5,LOVE this movie,"I love Mrs. Miracle. I will watch it every Christmas season. Doris Roberts is PERFECT in her role! I'm a sucker for a happy ending!The seller sent the DVD in a timely fashion, and it was packaged well."
4,Very good,"Some great chemistry between the 2 leads in this movie. I liked the back & forth play between the main characters, and how their relationship helps them see how to let go of grief and anger, and move on with their lives after tough circumstances. They are able to learn from each other, and thus make room in their hearts for their relationship to blossom. Enjoy !"
4,Magic Makes the Miracle,"Santa doesn't do the magic in this movie, Mrs. Miracle does (but doesn't Doris Roberts always!). This movie is quaint, and funny. I enjoyed it."
2,Where are the answers?,"Bought this publication to enhance my sons lessons and even though the table of contents states there are answers, the fact is there are none!How are we supposed to know the solutions are correct."
2,Algebra 1 workbook a bust,i purchased this workbook and it indicates that the answer key was included however there isn't an answer key so if you are a novice at algebra like i am it doesn't help if you do not have the answer key to let you know if in fact you are grasping the concepts. i am very disappointed.
3,Algebra,The book is cheap because it is missing 15 pages of answers! If algebra is new to you there is no way to see if you are correct. There should be a warning that the answers are missing.
3,"So far, it is great!","This is book is for my son's summer homework. So far, it is great! We will know the results when the summer is over..."
4,Bow,"Its not my fave Bow Wow single, but its alright I guess, cuz all the boyz songs R da bomb! If your a ghetto girl youll like it most though;)"
4,Nice bag.,"This bag seems to be built well and has plenty of room for shoes , towel , and other items. Wheels are heavy duty and it pulls well or can be carried if needs be."
3,bowling bag,"The bag is OK, but a bit smaller than I thought it would be. I was looking for a bag that holds two balls and TWO pairs of shoes. It's a very tight squeeze, but it will work OK."
5,Evokes a sense of romance & hope for all waiting for love!!,"This single ""A Matter of Time"" by Jason Sellers just makes me stop and listen. My heart and my feet can't help beating to the rhythm, while my ears hang on every word. This song has a ""superhero-like"" quality because of the lyrics. I'm a big fan and hopefully, if I hold on long enough, I'll find myself at one of Jason's concerts!!! I want to know more about him!"
5,I think Jason Sellers has a warm & true voice That Does It,I have bought this cd and Jason has the greatest amount of soul in his music and can really make you feel the song. we would like to hear more radio airplay from this young man! ( are you listening?)
4,For the dedicated few,"I'm a diehard fan of Ayers - at least, his early stuff with Soft Machine, David Bedford, Mike Oldfield and Lol Coxhill - and I love this CD set. But the sound quality veers from aweful to passable, and some of the cuts are very loose, to be kind.But if you're into Ayers and his crowd, get this - killers versions of Lunatics Lament, Lady Rachel, Stop This train, and others."
1,"Terrible, horrible, no good, very bad case.","This is seriously the most useless game case I have ever used. You can fit exactly two controllers into the case; you can fit quite a few games in the provided holder, but this is very risky because the sleeves are too loose and the games can easily slip out and get scratched. You could potentially fit another controller or some games in cases in the top compartment, that is if the power brick didn't take up over 60% of the space. The package says it was designed to work with either the 360 or the original Xbox console, and while it can at least accommodate the console itself, it's clear that this was designed with the original box in mind, because it's intensely inconvenient to use with the 360. This thing was a complete waste of thirty bucks.Go buy the officially licensed backpack from MadCatz (it's a sad, sad day when I'm forced to endorse MADCATZ); it's more expensive, but you'll end up getting something else if you buy the GPak anyway."
3,Gpak bag is great high quatily!,This bag is great for a xbox 360 or a slim ps3. Mine has lasted a good 6 months. I've usedThe crap out of it seems to hold up nice.
3,Not bad,"It's not bad, but not that great. Maybe a little expensive for what it's worth but it's pretty much like the picture and decription."
4,"Very nice, but a tad tight.","This thing is great in basically every way, but I wish it had more section dividers, for example, a divider so that the Xbox360 console would be seperate from the massive power brick. ;) Also, it would be nice to have a separator for the top section, for the controllers. It was a little tight in the bottom section that holds the Xbox and the power brick, but not too bad.I successfully fit the following in this case:One Xbox360 with Hard Drive.One Xbox360 Power brick (AC adapter)Two Wireless Xbox360 Controllers.One AV cable.Lots of games!Everything you need to carry your Xbox to a friend's house! Works great!"
3,Decent case for the 360.,"The case is alright. I mean, I'm able to throw my xbox, video cable, and a controller in the same case with out any problem. Unfortunately the company forgot about the most important part about the 360: The power brick. Yeah. There is no room to cram this thing at all. So if you're looking for a traveling case that can hold EVERYTHING, look somewhere else."
4,Quit whining,"I dont know what everyone is whining about. The Gpack says it will fit the console, 2 controllers, and accessories + up to 16 discs (without cases). It does just that. I got my 360 console, hard drive, power supply, power cable, A/V cable, 16 discs, 2 controllers, 4 rechargeable batteries and the charger in there with a little room to spare. I could probably fit a little more. Great buy for the money. I only wish that it was a little sturdier (its just padded nylon)"
2,Plods instead of trots,Scraggy EP does have its jaggedly aggressive moments but is too limitedly lo-fi in its minimal assaults to retain acute interest
2,title of review,"After being initially impressed by the songs I'm From Hell Open A Windle and And Giraffe Natural Enemies I was surprised to find the rest of the album is mostly weak and dull. They don't really do much, they just have a few blah rock riffs and a bit of dissonant noisyness, but they don't really demonstrate any interesting or good ideas, and the ideas they have really don't go anywhere or warrant the amount of repetition they get. I wanted to like this band but I guess it's not going to happen. I thought the rest of the album would at least be semi interesting, but these songs are bitterly disappointing. They mostly revolve around powerchords and single notes with a bit of noisyness. They don't have any focussed or interesting chord arrangements. The whole thing just feels like a lazy jam session."
3,Cluttered,"Things start out swimmingly with a down and dirty ""Spoonful"" but followed by a less inspired ""I Want to be Loved"" but a mean ""Little Red Rooster"" guitar line revives things momentarily. Nothing on the rest of the album really moved me, although the raw, unpolished sound of the band did give a nice ""dirty"" feel to most of it. But I agree that Vernon Reid overplayed his hand, often causing what should have been a good basic blues band sound to be cluttered by his over exertion on guitar. I play this one track at a time shuffled with other blues CDs. Listening straight through it gets to sounding tiresome after ""Rooster"".Strangely,No Escape From the Blues: Electric Lady Sessionsrecorded with the same core musicians in 2003 (and also produced by Vernon) is much more listenable. I'd get that first."
5,THE WAY IT IS,Ken plays and sings like rock n roll was made to sound like! This CD is for you if you like to ROCK! From his days with Shout to his solo stuff Ken Tamplin gives it his all on every song and you can hear it.
2,smelly,"This cream is a very good product that helps heal skin, IF you want to smell like a Bento Box Lunch! STRONG sesame oil aroma."
3,Watch out if your own ipod classic it will stop working,"This adapter works with my nano and my ipod 5g but I purchased a 160gb ipod classic so I could put full 16bit on it. IT worked great, until I did the ipod software update, then it stopped working. I was able to fix this but installing older versions of the ipod software on the ipod but now it has the bugs that the older software had. Just a warning that apple screwed this one up.Eclipse claims it is fine but I have double checked my issues, the classic will not work."
4,Good Country Listening,"An excellent tribute to K.W. There is a good mix for everyone to enjoy here. The Ricky Scaggs/Shenandoah duet is bluegrass at its best and the rest is Keiths music done by his friends as a tribute to this fine man. Also some of Keiths previously unreleased numbers on here that are very good. This is good listening, certainley a ""must have"" for any K.W. fan. Get this one ""while its available""."
4,The Old Curiosity Shop,"I watched this adaptation shortly after finishing the book. Overall, I thought it was an above average production, and enjoyed many parts of it very much. I appreciated the picturesque atmosphere and beauty of the film - it definitely captures the whimsical nature of the book. Also, all of the actors and actresses did a great job! Quilp in particular was super duper creepy.I was disappointed at the emission of some of the smaller plot lines featuring Kit and Dick. In my opinion, there could have been a few less shots of Nell and Grandfather rambling contentedly about the countryside, and a few more of the entertaining instances with these two delightful characters.All in all, I think that the minor complaints I do have are with the way the story was adapted, not with the way the adaptation was carried out. Nicely made and all in all an enjoyable experience!"
3,Don't Expect the BBC's Bleak House or Little Dorrit,"Made for the Disney Channel in 1995, this truncated adaptation of Dickens' beloved novel benefits from a strong performance by Peter Ustinov, and a near-brilliant one by Tom Courtenay, but suffers heavily from the role of Little Nell being played by Yorkshire actress Sally Walsh. Walsh's Nell is hardly the tremulous, emotionally complicated, and ultimately unforgettable child of Dickens' imagination, and without that emotional center the film is only modestly gripping and Nell herself is just an inscrutable bundle of bland ""can-do"" perkiness. The cinematography has the inevitable flatness of a made-for-TV movie: too much light, too little atmosphere. There isn't a memorable image in the entire three-hour movie -- which is shocking for anything based on Dickens. Still, it's a moderately enjoyable time-killer. Just don't buy it with the expectation of experiencing anything like the BBC's recent Bleak House or Little Dorrit."
4,Bravo to the cast a crew for a fine movie!,"I thought that Kevin Conner and John Goldsmith did an excellent job on this book. Even though I believe that their previous work on Great Expectations (1989) was far better, I was happy to see the same fine quality and acting as portrayed by Peter Ustinov, Adam Blackwood, and Tom Courtenay. The young and yet unknown actors also did a fine job. Blackwood did as wonderfully here as he did in the same filming of Great Expectations. Ustinov was like we've never seen him and Courtenay was marvelous!"
5,Great movie,"Really done well movie. I had not heard about this movie enjoyed it,would tell all to see it has a sad ending."
2,not a favorite Dickens based DVD,I just did not like the DVD. The characters were cartoonish and the scenes did not connect as well as Dickens deserves. I think the story could have been better told.
3,Little acknowledgement,The grandfather was too blind to see his grandaughters values.He had little acknowledgement of this and only thought of himself. His own greed for money and sickness for gambling made him a selfish old man.
2,"Fine movie, but terrible video quality in the dvd version","I previously owned this movie on VHS tape. I watched it several times, played it for friends, and enjoyed it thoroughly. I never read the book, but I suspect this is a good adaptation. It's long enough to contain a lot of detail and subplot. I especially like Tom Courtenay's over-the-top portrayal of the villain Quilp. Peter Ustinov, Edward Fox (in a small role as Ustinov's brother), and the girl who plays Little Nell are also very good. Many small roles are memorably acted. If you like Dickens and period pieces, it's a very good show.I then purchased this movie on DVD to keep it in my collection, and I was very disappointed. The video quality is far inferior to that of the earlier VHS tape. Having experienced the VHS version, I consider the DVD version unwatchable. Basically, they took a long movie and squeezed it onto a single disc. A pity!"
2,Useless book ..lots of filler pages,"The book is useless if you even have a very basic knowledge of web marketing.Marketing techniques like ""build a strong logo"" ,""have a marketing plan""(and most others)"" are just to fill the pages.Buy the book only if you are absolutely new to internet marketing."
2,Another ordinary book,The book is in fact very ordinary. I do not know how this book is getting such good review. Many of the marketing methods mentioned in this book are known to 99.9% of the users .I should have to be more careful in buying books in future. Will never go by the reviews
5,Best Web Marketing book I have read,"If you browse through a bookstore looking for a web marketing book, you encounter a few problems. First of all, many books are already hopelessly out of date in the fast-moving Internet world. Second, there are few books that give the ""meat and potatoes"" of web marketing. Joe Tracy's book solves both problems, being both up-to-date and extremely informative. Tracy's book is loaded with excellent marketing tips, rated on his experience of their effectiveness. Its virtually impossible for anyone to know EVERY method of web marketing he lists. And Tracy describes many, many techniques to market your website that cost little or nothing! I would highly recommend this book for anyone who has been given the task of promoting a website."
1,Meandering and dull,This book had the potential to be a mindblowing epic about life on the brink in the wilds of the Rockies. Instead it was a blithering collection of numbing conversations between cardboard characters set in stock scenes from a Hollywood rendition of the Old West.
5,diverse,"everlast has come out with a mix of rap and folk.It still has the base,but is mixed with acoustic guitar riffs.The rymes are still his best work.This a very good album.If u like beck then you should like Whtey fordsings the blues."
5,Marginal Hip-Hop Fan Digs Whitey Ford...,"Let it be said that I have never actively sought out hip-hop music. However, when I first heard ""What It's Like"" I was instantly drawn to this record. I find myself not being able to take it out of my player. The range of this album is massive and so appreciated in this day when every song on a CD sounds the same. From the brilliant folk-inspired ""What It's Like"" to the driving ""Hot to Death"" to the gospel-feel of ""7 Years"" to the the honesty of ""Today (Watch Me Shine)"" this album totally delivers. Everlast has outdone himself and his label should be proud of supporting a decisive change from an already accomplished artist."
3,A few good songs but a lot of [junk],I bought this cd based on the single What it's like. Most of the songs are nothign liek What it's like. Ends is good and so is The letter. the letter is the only reason this gets 3 stars. Download the song and skip the album.
2,Nothing Special,"Former House of Pain member Everlast mixes a couple of styles in his second solo album, joining rock, hip hop, folk, spoken-word and blues. The result is a professional, well-crafted record with some consistent songs but never really rises above average, been-there-done-that material. There are some fine moments here like ""Ends"", ""Get Down"" and ""What It`s Like"", while most of the other songs are merely listenable/ forgettable and the record has more hip hop than it really needs. It`s a bit too long, either, becoming unappealing halfway through. Probably this is one of those ""for fans only"" albums. I guess I`m not included."
1,"Don't be fooled by ""what it's like""","I bought this a few months back based on hearing ""What It's Like"" on the rock stations. I never heard them play any other songs in the commercials for the album. I guess I know why now. This is all RAP with tracks that sound like answering machine messages mixed in. If that's your thing, get it. It's not mine and I felt tricked."
5,He Rocks And Raps,"This White Rapper Kills Anything That Pussy Eminem's Got.He Come's Prepared With Originality And Live Beats. I Suggest Buying This Album. He Has An Acoustic Rap Going On Song's Like Ends, What It's Like, And Today( Watch Me Shine). This Is A Must Have Cd."
1,Filthy Album,Don't waste your time or your mind listening to this album...one song is cool - but even that is filled with expletives...this guy's a moron loser and i regret buying it...thank God i didn't pay much for it...and thank the Lord that I was able to trade it in at a local store.
1,White Boy Rapper At His Worst,"I bought this disc for ""What It's Like"" and ""Ends"". Well I must say those where actually listenable. The rest are mostly Everlast trying his best to rap. If your looking for songs like his singles, PLEASE go for them and them only. The rest are so bad you can barely listen to the CD. Whatever you do don't buy this trashy white boy's music."
1,"Waste of a CD.... this is garbage, seriously","This is garbage. Everlast is filthy, vile, anti-everything good, and of no worth to the human mind other than to dilute, discourage, cloud, and otherwise weed out any remaing positive feelings and thoughts one may have. How's that for freedom of speech? It's the truth! Not worth the disk it was recorded on. Be careful of what occupies your thoughts.... music is very influential. This influence cannot lead to anything good."
2,"2 Great songs, the rest is trash","When I heard the two popular tracks (Ends, What It's Like), I thought the CD was a must for my collection. I have had the CD for over a month and the only two songs I listen to are the above mentioned tracks. Granted, I am not much of a present day rap fan. Today's rap artists rely more on production work and four letter words than substance. Gone are the days of true talent in the rap world. If I may steal a quote from a musician friend of mine, ""No matter how much you polish a turd, it is still a turd"". I gave Everlast two stars for the two tracks that I mentioned above. Next time I will not be so quick to buy a CD based on two songs."
1,Everlast is the Second Coming,"Whitey Ford sings the blues... IS a bad album , and i dont like it , he is a washed up rap star, trying to be a folk singer, Vanilla Ice tried it, and it diddnt work! So why would everlast try it? This album is a waste of money, he has to get washed up rappers like Prince Paul to be on this piece of junk, if you like MTV and you like alternative rap albums, than buy this album. I think Everlast's first solo album ( Everlast's Rap is Evil, and i love God) was a much better solo album please do not buy this album thank you very much"
3,"""What It's Like"" is a good song, otherwise...","This CD is ok. Marky Mark and Vanilla Ice were practically crucified for being white boy rappers. But now Everlast and Eminem are totally accepted as white boy rappers. I guess as long as you look like a gangsta or a thug, then it is ok. Well, I did like House of Pain's ""Jump Around"". And I did like ""What It's Like"" when it came out (although I would hardly call it a ""rap"" song). If you are into this kind of rap/rock music, I am sure you will enjoy this CD. If you just liked ""What It's Like"", you might not like this entire CD. ""What It's Like"" is more like a male vocalist singer/songwriter tune in the tradition of Shawn Mullins, Duncan Sheik, etc. The rest of this CD is more rap oriented. So if you are looking for a CD full of male vocalist introspective tunes, you won't find it here."
3,It was interesting,I thought What It's Like was cool but the rest of the songs were just ok. I think Ford should do more songs like What It's Like because it was just of better value.
2,Everlast is a POTTY MOUTH!!!,"I must admit that I do like ""What It's Like"" because of the statements it makes about homelessness, choice, and violence. BUT the language is horrible. This relentless attack on decency by modern ""musicians"" is old."
4,Yo...we need consistency!!!,"I really enjoy Everlast's jams...House of Pain made me feel good when I listened to them, no doubt. A few of the jams on this CD made me feel the same way...only in a different way but equally as good. I only ask that all the songs keep the same feel...the same vibe...the same grove. Keep up the great work EVERLAST!S-Man"
5,Everlast is the bomb,"Ive been an Everlast fan since 89-90 when his first solo cd came out.The House of Pain was the greatest rap group to ever exist.So when I recently bought Whitey Ford Sings the Blues, I wasnt dissapointed.This is probably the best cd ive ever bought.Ive seen H.O.P. and Everlast live and if you get a chance to go see them do it you wont be sorry. He puts on a kick a** show!!!!"
2,Big Dissapointment,"I was so excited and pumped to get this album but when I did I was very dissapointed. I was unsatisfied with the lyrics and think that this was a major let down. I thought that with songs like ""what it's like"" and ""ends"", that it would have been a stronger album. I found that those were the only two songs that I listened to. I would not recommend purchasing the album, but rather just enjoying the tunes on the radio."
2,Not My thing.,"I really like the bluesey music sound, but didnt know what would be a good CD to purchase since I am infamiliar with themusic world. Purchased this CD after hearing one of the songs, (The only actual Blues song on the CD.) I was shocked at the foul language and the fact that, except for 1 song, this is a hip hop CD.I went in the trash can!!"
1,Whitey,This CD is not what I expected .....I should have listened to a sample of the entire CD. Only one or maybe 2 songs I really like...but that's me maybe someone else would like it better.
2,Do not Get this Album,"Besides ""What its Like"" this album is nothing. He confuses you, you get the impression he sings bluse kind of music, then you get the album.Its all rap!!Not worth the money"
2,About three good songs.,"Most of this album is just treading water electric hip-hop. If you're expecting it to sound like the singles on the radio, you're wrong! If you're a fan of White rap, however, you might like this. I could barely make it through any of the songs."
5,this cd totally kicks @$$,"i'm a punker and i give this cd a five star rating. my favorites are ends, what it's like, money, and painkillers"
1,For hip-hop and rap lovers only,"I bought this CD based on hearing ""What It's Like"". Every other song is rap/hip-hop. If you don't generally like that type of music, don't waste your money on this CD."
1,A Dark Cloud of Evil and Filth,"This is garbage. Everlast is filthy, vile, anti-everything good, and of no worth to the human mind other than to dilute, discourage, cloud, and otherwise weed out any remaing positive feelings and thoughts one may have. How's that for freedom of speech? It's the truth! Not worth the disk it was recorded on. Be careful of what occupies your thoughts.... music is very influential. This influence cannot lead to anything good."
4,GUITARS AND ALL! IT'S WORKING FOR EVERLAST!!!,"Everlast's latest album, ""Whitey Ford Sings The Blues"" is a great CD. Since leaving House of Pain in 1994, Everlast's been making songs with fat beats and slick guitar playing.This new CD, Everlast's second solo CD, is a must-buy!!!"
5,a very good cd,the hit what its like is the best song today that describes the life that many indivduals encounter eery single day
3,Leaves you wanting,"I heard the song 'What It's Like' on MTV and immediately bought the CD. This song is one of the best I've heard from any artist in the last decade. Unfortunately there are only two other tracks on the CD that are even remotely close to the style of this great song. The rap that is the focus of this CD is ok (better than most because of the lyrics), but was not what I was looking for. I certainly hope Everlast puts out a new CD with more of the type of grinding, soulful, bluesy rock he exibited in the song 'What It's Like' sometime in the near future. I will definately buy it if he does, but I will read the reviews of the next one before rushing out to spend my money. All in all though, the CD was worth the purchase price-just leaves you wanting more."
5,This was a new thing for me but I loved it!,"I had never heard of Everlast until ""What it's like"" Debued. I never had heard of ""The House of Pain"". I never liked rap really. So i got it having the imprection that it was going to be alternetive/rock. But when I found out it was rap it was a BIG suprise to me. But I have found I really liked it. This Album had great Lyrics wiht a steady beat that kept it going strong. Please if you don't like rap try this. It's one of the better rap Albums."
4,Awesome CD-start to finish,"This cd really surprised me. I bought it because of the ""what it's like"" track, but was really impressed with the mix between blues and hip hop. There's a story and a moral that's easy to identify with in every song. The biography that Whitey Ford wrote on the inside of the cd booklet is also very interesting. It is commendable that he finished the recording of this cd after a heart attack(did you know that?) This cd is energizing, yet soothing. Exellent for the soul."
3,Maybe not what the masses are looking for,"I have a great deal of respect for Everlast and I bought this based on ""What it's Like,"" and I was surprised that not much of the record was similar to this song, unfortunately. However, ""Ends"" is a very nice, melodic, if not overly dark tune, and it is almost worth the cost just for the aforementioned songs."
5,HOUSE OF PAIN BEWARE!,"Personally, I felt that Everlast could have tried a little bit harder, considering that this was his first studio recording in years. He truly brought back memories of House of Pain, with former members DJ Lethal (now in Limp Bizkit), Danny Boy (working privately with Tommy Boy Records), and of course Everlast. He brought some of his old hip-hop style, in songs such as ""Dollar Bill, Y' All"". He even parodied his lifestyle with his ""White Boy is Back"" intro song. He also added a flavor of country with ""What It's Like"" and ""Ends."" This is definitely an album you don't want to miss!"
2,"Despite the title, this is still straight-forward hip-hop","""What it's Like"" caught my attention at first, but I was disappointed with the rest of the CD. It doesn't really take any chances. Everlast doesn't blend folk, rock, and rap, but rather he raps over folk and rock rythyms. Other than ""What it's Like,"" this CD is predictable hip hop. It would have been fresh ten years ago, but now it's nothing new."
5,Who siad white boys can't rap?,"This is an awsome CD. I listen to it every day. Also if you get this you gotta get ""Eminem"". But any way I didn't like newer rap before I got this CD. Whitey still has that house of pain feel but with a very well rounded feel. I LOVE THIS CD.not to mention the guy in real life is awsome."
4,Awesome rap/rock combo,"I don't know how, but everlast manages to pull off the rap/rock combo like nobody else. Alot of tracks, some great guitar work, and incredible song writing make this album a winner. I would even recommend it to people who do not like rap music so much; trust me, you will like this album"
4,"Not What I expected, But still great!","If you think all the songs on this album are going to be like ""what it's like"" your wrong. I bought this album for that song and found more rap than anything. The songs like ""what it's like"" are few and here they are: ""Ends""(great song), ""Today (watch me shine)"" (also great), and of course ""what it's like"". Even though i am not a fan of rap, some of his rap songs are pretty good. Here they are: ""Get Down"", ""Painkillers"", ""Hot to Death"", and ""Tired"""
5,Whitey Ford Sings By Everlast The Blues is a great CD.,"I just got the CD. I realy like ""Ends"" and ""What It's Like"" Dont think the CD is going to be just going to have Blues Music on it. It has a nice mix from Rock to rap to blues. This is a great cd if you like music."
2,i agree with the guy from vancouver!,"there are only about 3 songs i listen to on the cd. what i expected was songs like what its like that mereged acoustic guitars and rap, but what i got was a bunch of uninspired rap songs that don't have very good beats. the lyrics are good, which adds a star to this review, but if you like the words and not the beat of a song, how long can you listen to it, really? i see many people really like this cd judging by the reveiws, so maybe its not my cup o' tea, but i would say listen to it fisrt b4 you buy it!"
2,Don't waste your money,"This cd was a huge disapointment. If you've heard ""What it's like"" and ""ends"" you've heard all that's worth listening too. The rest of the cd sucks. If you buy it do it for those two songs because the rest is just cheap rap."
5,One of my favorites,"Whitey Ford Sing's the Blues is one of the best albums that I have listened to. I love his song ""Get Down"" the best. If you like a combination of new age rap and rock then this is the album for you. If you buy it you will not be discouraged."
5,starcase,I really enjoyed this album. It's lyrics really hits at home with a sad soul. A steady and rhythmic beat keeps you in the music and and feeling the moment. Although this is very good music; I believe that all of the foul language is not needed for the listeners appeal.
3,Anger Unlimited,"When the tune ""What It's Like"" hit the airwaves in 1999, people started listening to this vocalist (of JUMP AROUND fame) with the mesmerizing sound. Though lyrics were edited for radio, the cd contains the explicit version and is quite powerful in its message. It brings the reality of the streets right to your eyes just by hearing the words. Unfortunately, other tracks are really too harsh to enjoy unless rap and rock mixes are your thing. This CD disappointed me because I loved the sound of his voice on that one track and guess I expected other songs to be just as listenable. I was wrong."
4,A day hasn't passed that everlast isn't blasting in my car,"Simply, I love this CD. I have never wanted to voice my opinion on music before, sense music is very much personal taste. However, I have friends of all kinds (hip-hoppers, Hippies, Ravers.....) and not one has had a negative thing to say about Everlast. This album appeals to anyone with an open mind. And that doesn't take much."
5,WHITEY FORD TAKES THE CAKE :),"NOt onLY doES EvERlasT reflect the consious lyrics, mad stylee, and music versitiality, his record ""Whitey FOrd Sings The Blues"" is the best record to come out of 1998 & probably will stay the BEST RECORD way into the next millienum. The beats are HOT, his lyrics are beautiful and this record shows what a true musician and artist he has EVOLVED INTO. You can see how much this man has GROWN. SO if you don'[t already own it.. go out and buy a COPY. IF you already have the album, go buy 5 MORE. for you, them, you and me. :) ALRIGhT. MUCH LUV. Everlast your a beautiful person kid. stay STRONG & HOLD TIGHT. rEspecT- julie"
4,I'm feelin' this CD!,"I bought this one one out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised. As a fan of hip-hop, alternative, jazz, blues, etc. -- it was cool to see an artist try to expand his musical vibe. The instrumentation was dope and there was much passion in the music. I think it will only be better in a live show!!! Add to the collection."
5,damn good album,"I really didn't who I was buying at first. I heard ""what it's like"" on a local rock station, and liked it so much I bought the CD. It surprised the hell out of me to hear the rap and folky rock mixed together. It is great to hear a band that is versatle enough to produce good songs in two comepletly different genres."
2,House of Pain is back!,"It is nothing diffent from house of pain. The only good songs on this album are Painkillers, What It's Like, and ENDS. There was no point of him going solo, it's the exact same as House of Pain. So if you like House of Pain, get this. But if you want change, don't."
4,It RULES,"Whitey Ford sings the Blues is one of my most listened to CDs I own! I would definently recommend it, also I would recommend KoRn ""Follow the Leader"", Barenaked Ladies ""Stunt"", Offspring ""Americana"", Green Day ""Nimrod"" and Orgy ""Candyass"""
2,A big disappointment,"I bought this CD because of What It's Like . . . thought it would be a good bridge between rock and rap, but was I wrong! What It's Like is fabulous - the other songs are nothing but obscenity and noise. I switched it off before I even heard the whole thing. Try again, Everlast!"
1,Two radio song and that is it,"I was really dissapointed by this album. I read all this hype and accliam... Then I bring it home and start listening and boom sounds like House of Pain. I was suckered into thinking Everlast had a new style, but it is still as bad as it was years ago. I must admit Ends and What its Like were superb. Even after listening to the slbum a few times hoping something would grow on me there was no luck. I am sorry though it has a break through song this album is not worth the time or money."
2,What it's like carries the album,"What it's Like is definitely the best song from this cd. No disputes with that. It carries a powerful message and is an enjoyable beat. Unfortunately, it is not representative of the rest of the cd. The majority of is rap of lower quality. You'll want to preview the other songs before purchasing this one, because they sound to me like a one hit wonder so far."
1,One good song.,"This cd is the worst cd I have ever bought.None of the songs were like their only hit ""What It's Like"". The lyrics are awful also, I think ever songs had at least one cuss word in it. With eighteen songs on this cd, I thouht they would have at least one good songs besides ""What It's Like"", but it doesn't. After a while ""What It's like"" gets on your nerves too. I would have given this zero stars of I could. I would not tell any one to get this cd. But if you waste your money you can buy mine."
1,Both a good and bad surprise.,"For those of us who listen to all types of music,this cd seems like a good idea when your at the music store.However when you get home the cd fails and is put on the ""bad"" cd rack.Only to return when Your in the mood for one good song."
1,Rap in the Rat Trap,"I am 51 years old, white, and professional. There is a small sector of this genre that I do like. Will Smith from Men in Black is one. A brief bridge in Overkill by Jimmy Buffet is another. After reading the reviews of this I was really anticipating to find more that I would enjoy. What I heard was not unlike being stuck in a large bowl of oatmeal without milk, butter, sugar, and fruit. It was amorphous and rapidly irritating, sticking to my chin much more than my heart. I would strongly urge all those who have an interest in exploring this genre, to engage in auditory exploration before financial divestiture. Thanx! P.S. Whitey should have kept his job as a starter for the NY Yankees. A terrific southpaw!!! P.S.#2 (P.P.S.)As a salmon going upstream, I seriously urge Mr.Ford to consider changing his eponym from the sweet science brand of Everlast to Neverlast. Only time will tell."
2,There's Better Indie/Emo For Your Buck,"When I downloaded the first two songs and the last one on this album I was pleasently suprised. But when I got around to buying the album, I was a little disappointed. The three songs I downloaded were the best ones on the CD. Aside from the singer sounding like he's just singing because no one else wanted to, and showing a total lack of emotion, the music is just mundane. One song blends into another and before you know it, your wondering what happened to the CD. It's not that bad a CD, but I haven't found myself playing it anywhere lately."
4,About the last Review,"Dude, I agree that this is a great album, but what are you smoking? Did you read what you wrote, and if so, does it make sense to yourself? Come to think of it, you sound like a proffessional CD reviewer...keep it up :)"
3,Good to fall asleep to,"This is an okay album at best. The music is much better than the vocals and lyrics. Many of the tracks have great openings but I am continually disappointed when Ben Jorgensen (vocals) opens his mouth. Also for being classified as emo, there is a lacking of emotion. This album would be better with different vocals."
2,ehh,"I owned this CD for a while, based solely on a recommendation by a very misinformed person. But hey, nobody's perfect. I dug a few standout tracks on it. But it just got real boring real fast. And not the kinda boring like that porn video you watch every day and get sick of and set it aside for a month, then go back and its like new. This album just has no shelf life whatsoever. If you like bland ""emo rock"" with flat, emotionless, monotone vocals, then this'll be right up your alley. I mean yeah, it has its moments, but then there'll be a part in a song that comes up and makes me want to punch myself in the balls, or Professor Geekmaster comes in and starts singing like a whiny robot about god knows what. I traded this CD in at my local record store and got 5 bucks for it. Then I bought tacos."
2,"great music, lyrics are bland","I loved this band because musically they are pretty impressive. but after listening to the lyrics it gets kinda boring. i can understand that simple lyrics can add a good classic touch to a song, but some lyrics are just really mediocre and monotone and very repetative. what really sux the most is at times in a song they'll have their good moments and then a few seconds later the lyrics are just horrible. keep the music, fix the lyrics."
2,meh,"dont get me wrong, this cd is not bad at all, however, it is not at all original. this band sounds just like every other false-emo band. i would have givin it one star but i like the song ""my town.""ATTN: music industry; we dont need any more crumby false emo bands. stop signing them and putting out their unoriginal records.thank you.citizens of the U.S. who like good music.BTW this style of music is not real emo. emo is short for emotional hardcore which started in the D.C. area in the 80's. bands like indian summer and clickitat ikatowi. check them out."
2,Ew,I was listening to this and the person's voice is awful. He's not even like on tune. It's very annoying.
4,Good,The album is really good but not much songs in it like most of te except like 2 but still good album
3,draining,"There are maybe 3 or 4 good tracks on this cd. The rest all sounds wish washy. There is no structure to most of the songs and the muscianship is quite mediocre. The vocals however, are intriguing, soft, and emotional. You just wish it would reach some sort of peak, but the songs just never reach the next level (like in I give Up, goodbye, a great track). For just being one guy, this is quite good and Im sure it will only get better in time."
3,It's OK,"This works, but in my opinion, the Scotch High Performance Head Cleaner works better. Only problem is trying to find it for sale."
1,Waste of money,"Don't even bother purchasing this. I tried over ten times to get this to work. Finally, broke down and manually cleaned my VHS (which I really didn't want to do) and now have great picture."
2,Not what I received,"What I received is not what is pictured. I had ordered this Maxell head cleaner several months ago and was very satisfied with it. I decided to order a second one since they are so hard to find now. However, what I received recently was not as pictured, and it doesn't seem to work. Unfortunately, it will cost as much to send it back and so is not worth it."
5,Keeping our VCR alive,"Our son, like many, likes to watch movies over and over again. I know how hard it is on a VCR to rewind over and over again, and to put a dusty tape in the VCR may mean doom for the tape and player. I could no longer find these cleaners in any store, so I bought them here. We are down to our last VCR, but these cleaners have added time onto it and two other used devices. They do just what they say they will, and just when I think the VCR has had it, after a cleaning, it is working again!"
1,Maxell Dry Tape Video Head Cleaner,"I do NOT recommend this product. After using it, my VCR picture was nothing but fuzz. I had to have the heads professionally cleaned in order to correct the problem."
2,VCR Cleaner,"Service was fine, unfortunately the VCR Cleaner does not clean well at all.I've tried on two different VCRs. Ran the entire tape through three times."
1,Did not work,"The tape was flimsy plastic. The reels would not turn in the VCR. The tape machine would not accept it. The tape would be ejected with flashing ""Error"" on the VCR screen. I was very disappointed for I have tapes that are older and need cleaning. I tried many times to get the tapes to work. I sent them back and received a full refund."
1,No dice.,"Let me say that it's possible that I received a defective cleaner, but this one actually set me back. When put into the VCR, it would not complete the 20 second cleaning cycle. It played for maybe 5 seconds, making a terrible grinding noise, before stopping. I tried it on two VCRs because I wanted to make sure it wasn't my device, and also I'm a glutton for punishment. The cleaner did the same thing with the second (and newer) VCR. Unfortunately it messed up the head on the first VCR, so I'm waiting for another cleaner (NOT a replacement of this one!) to realign it. Thankfully amazon has a quick and easy return policy.Like I said, it is very possible this was a fluke since I bought it based on the positive reviews...but do be aware."
1,Don't be deceived,"If you're thinking that this picture looks like the GOOD, OLD version of the Maxell VP-100 video head cleaner, you're right, it does. The Product Features also describe the features of the OLD version - such as speaker check, onscreen instructions, etc. Unfortunately, what the seller actually shipped was the NEW, inferior version of Maxell VP-100. Which was exactly what I was trying NOT to purchase, having read many, many extremely negative reviews thereof.So curb that elation you were feeling at apparently having found some rare OLD Maxell's for sale, and don't be misled like I was."
1,destroyed my vcr,"The dry cleaner destroyed the picture, then the wet cleaner destroyed the unit.Complete and utter garbage, I should sue for the value of the vcr."
3,I can't rate this very well as it arrived damaged,Amazon is sending a replacement. Unfortunately mine arrived damaged and I had to return it. They say Dry Tape Head Cleaner's are better than wet. Maxwell has been in VHS and cassettes for awhile so I imagine it will be worth the investment. I'm hoping to download my video collection on DVD. So it will get much use!
3,dry VCR cleaner,"Well, it works...but it took several ""runs"" to clean my VCR heads sufficiently. Still given how difficult it has been to even find a VHS cleaning tape, I'm glad to have found this one. Who knows? Maybe my VCR heads were just VERY DIRTY?"
3,Eeeehhhh....,"I love how amazon pesters you for a review after a purchase. In this case, I can't really say for sure how this product is. I've used it once on a total of the 3 VCRs I own. I'm used to wet tapes vs. this dry, but my wet tape disappeared. My Panasonic VCR rarely, if ever, gives me grief - so I didn't notice any difference after cleaning. The cheapo VCR doesn't get used often anymore, so who knows?!?! The JVC VCR wasn't happy after being cleaned with this tape. It wasn't happy when I tried playing a tape of stuff I recorded off the TV using that VCR. It behaved better after letting it run awhile - and no, it wasn't that there was a problem with the tape. Also of note is that I don't play borrowed or rental VHS tapes in any of my VCRs, so they don't get funked up by those. I only play VHS tapes I own, or tapes I recorded on."
1,Did not work for me,I ordered this head cleaning tape because my VCR displayed a message that said the heads may need cleaning. The picture quality was actually fine until I used the Maxell head cleaner. After one pass through the VCR the picture quality was completely unwatchable with nothing but snow and ghost images. The Maxell VP-100 VHS Dry Tape Video Head Cleaner appears to have ruined my VCR. I haven't been able to watch anything on it since.
1,I just threw it in the trash,"I have used Maxell vcr head cleaners in the past that have something on the screen to let you know what is happening. This tape is about 10 seconds long, it's nearly impossible to tell when it begins and ends so it's very difficult to use. But the biggest problem is that it doesn't clean or help the performance of the vcr!"
1,new doesn't always mean better,"like some other reviewers, i've been using the maxell vp-100 for years with great success. then they ""upgraded"" and now the cleaner does not even run full cycle without stopping. furthermore, it really doesn't clean as well as the old version (the newer version has a cheaper-looking black-and-white cover sans any logos or design). i'm really disappointed in maxell and have been calling stores to hunt down the older version. eventually, i'll have to go online to order the older version if they are available."
3,Did Not Clean Adequately,"This product I'm sure works in some cases but in the case of my VHS cleaning job, it did not work. It did improve the picture but did not completely fix the picture. I gave it 3 stars rather than one star because I don't know if a wet VHS head cleaner would have done the job better and I made a poor selection or if the VHS is failing in a different way."
1,Worthless,I put the tape in and ran it as the directions said but the tape would not elect. I tried dozens of times but it still would not eject. Finally enough came out and I was able to grab it and pull it out. The tape was caught up in the vcr. I would never order this item again. Worthless and could damage your machine.
2,Hard to say if it works or not,"I was excited to get this vcr cleaner in the mail. I had two DVD/VCR combo players; one that hadn't worked in a while and the other that was only a year old. Neither one was playing. I used the cleaner on the oldest one and it made an improvement but not enough where I could start playing my tapes again. It didn't work on my newer machine at all. At first it played my manufactered movies, but when my wife started playing videos recorded from TV it refused to play the other tapes. In all fairness I don't really know what the problem is, but I had hoped this would be the solution. Oh yeah, the tape came out of the package and I had to toss it the same day."
5,good product,"this product was hard to find in stores because of the outdated vhs tape compared to dvds, blueray, etc. glad clean is still available"
2,I had to return the first one.,"OK, I paid less than 5 bucks but still I expected it to work. The first one came right away but the tape was stuck, the VCR kept giving me ""error"" when I pop the tape in. Turned out the tape was stuck. Amazon shipped me a replacement right away. The tape ran this time but turns out there is only enough to run for about 10 seconds then the VCR will just stop and show ""4"" whatever that means. I initially thought it was another defective tape since I was used to the old style magnetic tape cleaneers that will give me 20 cycles, with the vcr playing some video and audio indicators that the tape is cleaning (""audio-video test, right channel...."").It works but I am not happy with it."
2,Not a good item.,Does not work as expected. Almsot ruined my VCR. I was able to stop the process and fix my vcr.
1,PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS HEAD CLEANER,"As several other customers reported, this head cleaner wipes out your heads. Some users reported being able to restore their picture after a professional cleaning or repeated uses of another head cleaner. So far, after repeated usages of another brand head cleaner, my picture has not been restored. This product will destroy your record and playback heads. If you value your VCR, you WILL NOT purchase or use this product. If possible, I would give it a negative 5 stars."
2,Head cleaner for VHS player-recorders.,"This product is made in China and runs for ten seconds one cycle at a time with automatic rewind and no sound or video accompanying. This product is not like the previous head cleaner which had four cycles of aproximately two minutes each with a sound and video format. I liked the original product much, much better - not happy. Try to find Maxell SKU: 290058, UPC: 025215290053, to see if it does the job."
1,Wasn't worth buying,I have run this cleaner multiple times and my VCR still shows the clean the heads warning. Nothing has happened. Very disappointed.
1,DO NOT BUY !,"It does not do the job, its under 10 seconds of tape it starts and finishes even sooner,does not clean at all. I'm going with a wet system.Years ago it used to be good not any more."
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"I've been digitizing a lot of family movies, videos, etc., and it is very important that the VHS player I've been using has clean heads. We manually cleaned the heads when we started, but I purchased this to clean them intermittently during this very long process. The VHS player is running our tapes through very crisp and clear. I believe it's doing what it's supposed to do."
5,Clean vcr equals better viewing,put this tape and just push play and it cleans your vcr. My tv/vcr combo is an old model that I found free on the road side which had a fuzzy playback mode and and the voice was almost nonexistent. After playing the tape twice I now have a crystal clear picture and a normal voice on the vcr playback!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Really Cool Single!,"I really like t.A.T.u's single, ""All The Things She Said"". The remix of the song is fab and the song itself is better than most of the stuff that is played on the radio. The video and interview are good as well (even though the vid is somewhat different than anything put out by American pop-princesses). ""All The Things She Said"" is a really good single. I, do however think that it would've been nice to hear the Russian version of ""All The Things She Said"" on the single."
5,Remarkable!,I have heard it on the radio one month ago and I have managed to record it on the tape. I didn't even know who was that but I noticed that it wasn't an english-native band. When I found out that it was a Russian band I couldn't get happier!Now I cannot stop listen to it. I'm going to buy their album!
5,Cool!,"As soon as I heard All The Things She Said, I rushed out to by the single! I bought the album soon after, but this wasn't a waste of money as the three remixes aren't included on the album!"
1,I want my money back.,Title review ^I ordered this thinking it was new and got a fake version. I have contacted the seller but no response and I want my money back! Other than that I love this album and even though its a single I think the song and remix are perfect.
5,Love it!,"I didn't hear this song until it was used at the entrance music for my favorite WWE diva,Victoria.I loved it!It's an awesome song."
5,it's simple Great!,"The first time i listen to the music, it was amazing, and it's great these young girls duo has a awesome voice and i like the way they sing ATTS, but fortunately i saw it at some stores and i was shocked, and i like the bonus it includes the cd, i thin it is worthy to buy it!actually is constantly in my computer n my cdplayer, tatu is #1 !!"
4,All The Things She Said,"The song is unbelievably good. The lyrics are powerful, the music makes me want to get up and dance. An excellent, emotionally powerful, and catchy song. My one complaint with this single is the lack of other songs included. The only reason to get this is for the Enhanced CD track - if you don't care about that, spring for the full album, 200 km/hr In The Wrong Lane."
3,it does have an interesting sound......,"..........but beyond the amazing production, there isn't really all that much to tatu. a year or two ago they became pop idols or something in russia, simply by marketing themselves as sexy preeteen (or teen, but they do look kinda young) lesbian schoolgirls. i hear about how controvertial the video is, and you know what, it's nothing very shocking, just some nice passionate kissing scenes (that said, i highly reccomend you see the video). why is it that mainstream pop in foreign countries are so well recieved here? Oh, and if this is like the vinyl, there should be some rather interesting cover art. all in all, this is something neat to buy and well worth the $2 (assuming there are 4 tracks on this like on the vinyl: the original version and the remix in each english and its original russian) but i'm not one to listen to it often. If you want controvertial with music to back it up, try Sigur Ros or Bjork."
3,ya soshla s uma,"which is the russian title of the song, (translates to i went out of my mind)... i bought it just to check out the english version of the song, which isn't too bad at all. the extra bass and synth lines give it a darker, but even more club-like vive. all in all, very good for the american market *g*"
3,before you buy this music...,"...let me strongly reiterate what has been said many times by many other reviewers: BUY THE RUSSIAN VERSIONi first heard TATY in the summer of 2000 when i was a peace corps volunteer in kazakhstan, and immediately recognized it as superior to virtually all the other russian-pop that was played on the radio. but it's a shame they had to rerecord it in english just to sell it to america.not only is the russian version how the music was intended to be heard, it sounds much much better. the english lyrics simply do not flow with the melody like the russian lyrics do, and the first time i heard ""ya sashla suma"" in english, it sounded odd in the same way rap music in any other language but english sounds odd.if you choose to buy the english release, by all means enjoy it, but just know that there is a version of what you're listening to that is easily available and far better."
5,From Russia With Love,"Well well well! It's suprising to know that Russians would produce English pop songs, and even a bigger surprise when they are topping the charts in Europe and Asia. This single is very catchy and will get you humming to it in no time. I heard the two girls kissed in the MTV but who cares? Their music rocks!"
1,"The Chicks are Hot ,but the Song is Wack!!",The Gimmick is Catchy but the Song itself doesn't do anything for me at all.from what I've heard thus far I don't get the Hype from the Musical Perspective at all thus far.
1,gross,"these people suk its discusting don't buy these cds buy avril, evanessence, linkin park, vanessa, or michele cds"
5,This song rocks!,"I think ""All The Things She Said"" is the GREAT! I don't have the CD but I want it......I hear ""All The Things She Said"" on Q102 all the time and it is in the top 50 and the top 5. It is one of my favorite songs and if you haven't heard it yet you really should hear it."
4,Good Quality For The Price,Good quality satellite speakers for the price. Watch your order for it is one speaker per box and no cable with it. Needs 100 watts receiver and definitely needs subwoofer with it. I would recommend it to others.
5,Great things in a small package!,"I paired 2 of these 6751s with a 6750 polk audio package and an onkyo 605 receiver in a 16x16 theater room. I figured since we just finished the basement I would try to think to the future so I wired for 7.1 even though a lot of things still just play in 5.1. I'm not an audiophile but the sound is crisp and clear. I have an Xbox 360, xbox, and wii hooked up through the receiver to the 58"" panasonic plasma. The surround sound is fantastic on games, movies, and tv! I definitely got my money's worth with these speakers! Amazon had great prices and delivery was quick."
4,good sound small package,"good speaker for satellite use or as mains with a subwoofer, clear midrange up. do not expect extremely high volume. use them as they are intended."
5,Polk Audio speakers,This pair of speakers goes very well with my Polk Audio RM85 surround sound system. I have a Onkyo 708 (7.1)series Surround Sound system. The room is 12'x14' and the system sound is very crisp.
4,"Great speakers, but what bracket?","Review update - I moved the two new Polk speakers to be my front speakers and after hearing how they sound there I have since bought another pair to replace my older Sony side surround speakers. These sound great and I am real happy with them. Great sound at a reasonable price.I added these as rear surround speakers for my 7.1 system and they sound great. My only quibble is with the ""Integrated keyhole slot wall mounting brackets"". These are simply an extension to the speaker back that has a hole in it for hanging from a nail or screw (like a cheap wall clock). They do have the standard threaded hole for use with regular satellite speaker wall brackets (which I purchased separately). They're still a great deal but I really wouldn't plan on mounting these with the ""integrated bracket""."
5,Great for the rear surrounds,"Got these for the extra two needed to make a full 7.1 surround for the RM6750 Polk system. Very satisfied with the speakers, and of course match perfectly the satellites that come with the RM6750 system.Running a Yamaha RX-V765 with 95W through these using 16 gauge wire. Wonderful range and clarity. Mine did not come with any mounts, but have great molded hooks that you can use a deeper wood screw to hang if you will not need to aim them in a different direction from the wall face."
5,Forget going to the movies,Bought these speakers in a 7.1 setup for my home theater and they just blew me away. No more going to the movies. These babies will not let you down.....
5,Great sound from a small package,"Full, rich sound with a good bass effect from the rear port. Would only use for rear surround speakers, since their small size would not bring enough sound by themselves to properly fill a room."
4,Metallic card paper,"I have bought this type of paper in the past from Avery and have always loved the way my cards looked. For reasons unknown, this last package of paper doesn't seem to have that nice foil look to it. I don't think it is my printer because I have made a few cards using the paper from last year and the pictures are much shinier."
4,Avery personal creations 3382,"My order arrived in very good shape , nicely packed and on time.My only problem is I would like to purchase some more of this paper ( 3382)but can't seem to find out who has it.can you help me ?thank you Joyce"
4,A Breath of Fresh Air Indeed!,"I haven't cried this hard after reading a book ever before. A BREATH OF FRESH AIR was so good. Amulya Malladi is a terrific writer. I would give this book five stars but I wish she had written more about the Bhopal gas tragedy. But the characters were so well done, and the settings were perfect. I was with Anjali and her family in India as I read this book."
2,"Ok to Good, short easy read","If you're interested in a short, quick/easy read with insight into the conflict of modern Indian women, then this book is for you.I was only slightly intersted in the topic but purchased the book based upon the glowing reviews and because I enjoy reading an author's first work. I thought it was sad, but interesting, and thought the author did a good job portraying the conflicts experienced by modern Indian women, in terms of tradition, expectations, family and cultural influences.While I thought the characters were well developed and enjoyed how the novel was written through differen vantage points in terms of time and characters, I thought the storyline itself was a too underdeveloped and finished the book wanting something more and feeling unfulfilled."
1,This got published?,"The book starts off with an interesting premise, but the execution is horrible. The writing is pathetic and i can say with a fair amount of certainty, that my 10 year old son can make better sentences. The characters are as flat as pancakes and as interesting as navel lint. There is no development to the story and the initial villian undergoes a change of heart without thought, provocation or incident (much to the story's convenience). The story is obviously written with western audiences in mind as no one in India greets anyone with a ""how are you doing."" Innumerable discrepancies like this, play havoc with ones acceptance of the story. Ms Malladi's use of the Bhopal gas tragedy as a background is probably the only reason this terrible project saw the light of day, otherwise it would have remained, as it probably should have,a figment of her imagination."
1,"This book is not a ""5""!","My friends and I who love India share a lot of novels set there. I read the wonderful reviews of A Breath of Fresh Air and can't believe I just read the same book. My copy will be passed along to the Goodwill! I would be embarrassed to loan this to my friends. The book is written from the point of view of three characters, yetthe ""voice"" remains the same. It repeats the same issues over and over. The plot was a great idea. The book lacks depth and development."
4,Breathtaking Indeed...,"Amulya Malladi tells a tale of love, hope, forgiveness, facing the inevitable:death, infedility, divorce, struggle to find happiness all enveloped in this fine piece of prose set in India back a few decades ago!! The characters take on their own identities as every other chapter is told in a first person's viewpoint by the various characters in this story. (Anjali, Sandeep, Prakash, Indu)The story flows smoothly and the characters are given vivid and pungent identities, each one unique and the thinking pattern of each is distinct as they think out loud telling the chapters. I have never come across a book that tells a story in a way such as this, so it was a treat for me!!A good read if you find Indian Women authors intriguing as me!!Happy Reading!"
1,.....,"I got this item to use during a road trip from TX to MS with my 1 y/o twins. Once I got it buckled into place, my kids were able to just knock it right off. This tray is not secure at all. It might be easier to use with older kids."
3,"Easy to use, but not pratical for daily use.","I found this product easy to use. and as advertised. It stayed put for 15 month old to have books and toys handy. It has a simple press to release snap closure, but for simple trips to the store or something I found it annoying to have to unsnap and flip out of the way. It wasn't hard to do, it just added an extra step to the already numerous tasks we moms have to do. Would be great for snack time, or a longer trip, but keep in mind it will keep child toys/things handy, but it still does not prevent them from throwing those things on the floor and then wanting them back....."
5,Love this tray!!,"This tray works great. We've used it on long trips and short rides. Our daughter can put her books on it or her magna-doodle. The cup holder is in a good spot that she can reach and she likes putting snacks in the other holder. My only change would be a way to keep the strap in place when it is released. If I don't hold onto the strap as I unhook, it slips behind the seat and is tough to reach."
4,Simple solution/Fits our needs,"This tray is nice and large. The cup holder is big and holds a tippy cup great. We used this for travel only. We usually eat our meal in the car rather than stop and this helped us to be able to feed our toddler. She liked having a tray to eat off of. She didn't really want it hooked on other than for eating, but I imagine she will as she gets older. The tray was easy to attach. It does slope down a little so her food did slide towards her some. However, for the most part, it was a big help. We used this for our 1 year old and we have a large Evenflo carseat that has arm rests. The tray rested on the arm rests. If you don't have arm rests, I don't think this tray would work well for you. I do think it was overpriced - it is literally a piece of plastic with two straps attached. Should have cost $15 or so."
5,Perfect for long trips,"This tray was great for our 16 hour journey to Disney World. My 5 year old loves to color and this was perfect for her to be able to do that in the car. My only issue with it is that it sucks when she did'nt want it on anymore; and then later wanted it back. Very hard to do from the front seat. Otherwise-I'm sure we will be using this for a long time to come on more of our trips. Great for when it was time to eat as well, and there's a nice cup holder for a drink! I wish I would have bought this tray a long time ago!"
2,Doesn't work with a Britax Roundabout,"I really want to like this product--it's a great idea, useful and decently made, easy to clean, good size...but it just did not fit my daughter's car seat. She's 3 years old in a Britax Roundabout, I've had the Taby Tray for over a year and have tried several different configurations to get it to stay up. But since the car seat does not have armrests, the tray leans forward and down so everything spills off. The one thing I haven't tried is installing a pole from the van floor to the bottom of the tray to keep it from tipping forward. I ended up giving up and instead purchased a ""Go Anywhere Table and Footrest"" from onestepahead.com. That tray is smaller, but it has a post that adjusts vertically and can tilt so nothing falls off.The Taby Tray would probably work well for a car seat that has arm rests, like the example pictured, but did not work with the kind of car seat we have."
1,Good Idea - did not fit,"This is a wonderful idea, but it did not fit our Brittax Blvd. car seat. The tray tilted to far forward and down. I tried to install it many different ways, it just would not work. I had to return it."
4,Survived a 12 hour drive with 5 year old twins!,"Bought one for each kid, and after the first hour they could attach or remove the trays whenever they wanted by themselves. The drink cup holder is to small for most cups, but it held crayons perfectly. The arm rests on the booster seats i have are to low to support the tray, and the ones on the van seats are to far apart, but the kids were fine with the tray just resting on their laps when they wanted to use it."
4,Natural Health Herbal Medicine Encyclopedia,"Wonderful big lapbook with lots of pretty pictures - history section is great! Not an in depth guide to uses, I would not have this as my only resource but it's great to start with!"
5,Very helpful,We received this book as a gift from our oldest son. It is very helpful as a source of information on learing about the less common herbs.
5,Excellent Book!,"This is an excellent book if you would like to learn more about natural remedies and how to use them to treat various ailments. The pictures and illistrations are wonderful. There is so much information packed into this book. The only draw back it that the herbs are not listed in alphabetic order (they are in order if you know the scientific name) so you have to use the index a lot, but that's not so bad. A great book to have in anyone's natural remedy library."
1,Not sure how accurate this is.,"The more I read through this, the less convinced I am that it contains scientifically proven information. It is also often unclear as to which part of a given plant is being discussed in the text. I do, however, appreciate the full color photos of the plants. As someone who is serious about using herbs medicinally, I do not trust this text."
5,The best non-musical album ever made!,"I'm always accustomed to hearing some sort of music on a compact disc, so a recording of a comedy routine didn't win me over at first. But after hearing the first BUTTON DOWN MIND album, I've changed my tune (no pun intended). A great deal of today's comics rely on physical or slapstick humor to be funny. But comedy also requires expert timing and a considerable amount of intellect. Bob Newhart has both of these in abundance. It's no surprise this album was a smash when it was released, because even if most of the routines are considerably dated, they're still guaranteed to produce belly laughs in these more explicit and permissable times."
3,a classic comedy collectible,It was much funnier in the 1960s. Not all of Mr. Newharts routines have lasted the test of time. This is not the best example of his well-developed talents.
5,Bob Newhart's Comical Mind,I still enjoy Bob Newhart..whether on reruns of his two outstanding tv series or in any comedy special where he is featured.The Driving School and Abe Lincoln..I remember him doing those classic sketches on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show. Its simple..Bob Newhart is the best comedian/satirist since Mark Twain.
2,The Album seems like one long song,"From one song to the next, they seem to sound the same. I'd like to hear a little more chord changes with uptempo or down. But this album just rambles on and on like one long song(not that there's anything wrong with that). It's just not for me."
3,Prints easily and bright colors.,Used this for a present recently and I really liked how easily it printed no ink bleeding at all and how bright the colors were. Nice idea for homemade craft projects. Will deffinately use again!
4,"Stiff, but would work well for a tote bag","This iron-on printable fabric gave me bright colors and clear lettering through my HP inkjet printer. It's easy to use and fused quite well on my item. I used it for a quilt label. I recommend against this application unless it is an item that won't be washed, since it requires hand washing. It was very hard to stitch through (I placed it in the corner and the binding folded over it), so when using again I will be careful to locate it where I don't have to stitch through it. It would likely work well for tote bags or a wall-hanging that would require neither stitching through nor washing."
3,Great til you wash it,"These are great until you put them in the washer. I've tried LOTS of different kinds of iron on products - these look the best at first wearing and wash ""better"" than most, but still not great."
4,"Quality pictures, but heavy material","As many reviews have stated, this is a heavy material that would not work well if one wanted any kind of drape. The picture quality was excellent. I used it to print out old and current pictures of my family for a patchwork quilt that was a big hit. It would also be great for totes and aprons. Although I don't have kids, I could see this as a project they would really enjoy as well."
4,Fun,"This is a fun craft item with loads of possibilities. I avoided projects that would require me to cut around the image. I made a small pillow using a full sheet and I covered a wooden box lid. For the box I cut to size (top only) and trimmed with cording to cover the edges rather than attempt to cover corners. Both projects turned out well and the fabric adheres well. Images are relatively clear but I would like for the colors to be crisper, however. They are also a bit pricey so I gave four rather than five stars because of these two things."
5,A Must Read for All Women!!,This is one book that I have thoroughly enjoyed over and over again since I bought it. I even gave one as a birthday gift to one of my best girlfriends. The stories are inspiring and fun to read. This is a great gift book for any girlfriend!!!
5,"Fun, Funny and Fabulous",Oh Man - this was fun! You read about the adventures and escapades of these women and you just want to grab your girlfriends and go DO something! I especially liked the story of Bootsie and Detrice - that was my all time favorite! Next step - gettin' some of those yumilicious recipies and throwing a girlfriend party!!
2,A Ho-Hum Thing,"If you've ever heard someone tell a story, get no response, then say ""I guess you just had to be there"" then you'll know what it's like to read this book.At best, I'd call this a collection of ""nice"" friendship stories and bonding moments. But as far as the ""wild"" side of women's friendships, this book was a let-down. Perhaps the stories got better in the last half, because I could only read the first half before I gave up."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"This book is an incredible waste of time and money. Only a few of the stories are even mildly amusing. They all seem to be the type of event where ""you needed to be there."""
5,Proud to be a chick,"Its a chick thing was a great look into the lives and laughs of friends--you've done it, you wished you had done it--you can laugh at the chicks that did it! I've given it to all my special friends who can share a good laugh and dose of reality. Being a chick is ageless! Must read!"
5,A laugh out loud read,"I loved this book! The stories were so entertaining, they were told by all ages of women, so that all women could relate to each of the stories. I have sent this book to six of my girlfriends, and each one has called and thanked me for this absolutely entertaining book. We talked about all of the crazy things that we did as girlfriends, and renewed old ties. I highly recommend this book to everyone!"
3,It's was ok,"It had good stories in it.but, was lacking something. I wouldn't say I would recommend. It's was just an ok read to me."
2,not my cup of tea,"JCB only does the foreword. I only bought this book because I just saw her name. Next time, Ill b more careful. Not impressed"
5,Fun in a Book,"If you like bonding with other women, this is a great book for you. It provides laughs, inspiration, and great ideas for new adventures. I highly recommend reading this book and sharing it with all of your girlfriends. (Right up there with ""Kiss My Tiara"" and ""Ya-Ya's."") Its a collection of true stories and a quick read."
5,old gold,"This music took me back to my 20's. It's great. ""Fresh Garbage"" is stupendous. I'd forgotten about ""1984"". Good old rock and roll."
4,Spirit CD,"I ordered the Spirit CD for the song,"" I Got A Line On You"", Then discovered it contained the song, ""Nature's Way"" which is very good. Brought me back to the sixties. Cool!"
3,Light stuff!!!,I guess the title says it all. The Swans live were quite something back then. It remains as usual somewhat too intense to listen at home for an hour or so but the plaing is still something to be heard.
1,A disappointment,"When I was reading the summary of this book, I thought it sounded like a great book. Much to my dissatisfaction, it turned out to be a terrible book. The author moved the stoyr along much to quickly, and it wasn't anywhere near deep, considering the plot. The author didn't draw me into the book. I wish I'd not spent my $10.00 on the book and won't be buying anymore from this author."
5,Incredible !!,I have been always hooked on LM Books and I have to say this is one of her best. I couldn't put the book down and I finished the book in the middle of the night. My opinion it is a must read. It is sad and heartwarming the same time.
5,As Long as We Both Shall Live,All of Lurlene's books are good but this one has a connection with people that some of the other ones don't
5,A wonderful Mandrake Root--true to Machiavelli,"Please count me among the European Drama company's sincere and enthusiastic fans! I received a copy of the Mandrake Root. With great anticipation I watched the film unfold with a rhythm, tempo, agility, and grace that remained faithful to the text. The direction and skilled actors were able to maintain Machiavelli's wit while updating his humour. A genuine tour de force and a great, great pleasure to watch."
2,So Where's the Candle Stand?,"We received the candles in plenty of time to celebrate Kwanzaa, but no stand. Please send the stand asap.The candles are a good quality and would have displayed nicely for the students at our school if we had a stand."
5,Gentle and Sensitive,This product is for my mother who is an invalid due to a stroke. The caregiver wanted them for her use because they are gentle to her sensitive skin and clean well. I buy them by the case. I highly recommend Prevail Washcloths. (I buy the purple box ones.)
5,Prevail large washcloths make for a great cleanup,"My mother had these washcloths available to her at a nursing home/rehab center on a recent stay; when she moved in with us I needed to have them available in the house and in larger quantities than other products available in stores locally. I was very pleased to find the quantities and prices on Prevail at Amazon and immediately placed my order. Anyone needing to tend to the personal care of a person after toileting will appreciate this product greatly; just remember, never flush down the toilet... a plastic bag lining a small trash can works great for easy disposal! I highly recommend this product."
5,Massachusetts General Hospital Staff loved these!,"During my sister's recent hospitalization for a Bone Marrow Transplant, I brought PREVAIL WIPES in for her. EVERYONE asked about them, and I told them the name and where I had purchased them...Amazon.com. They are a perfect size and texture, and greatly aided in keeping an isolated room sterile for this procedure. Thank you! Joyce Poirier"
5,Wipes,"Ty! I am an eldeely person, and i use these because i cannot bathe myself, so they work, till someone can help me! Thank you, and i will b purchasing more!"
3,Adult Wipes,These were like other adult wipes I order. They're not as thing as some of the drug store brands. I will continue to use them.
2,Won't purchase again,"Had to replace another,(blue package) from this manufacturer that was discontinued.In this container the bottom 15 or so tissues are too wet.Almost need to be wrung out befor use.I will be seeking another product when shopping for wipes."
3,Not what i expected.,The towels were a little drier and a little thinner then i expected. I have used prevail washcloths from a packet and they were wetter and thicker. Over all I am disappointed and probably won't be ordering them again. Unfortunately there were many tubs in the order.
3,Nothing to rave about,"These cloths are usable but too dry. They are just barely damp, definitely need to be ""wetter"". Also, they smell like baby oil so not what an adult (esp. a man) would care for."
4,NICE SIZE AND FRAGRANCE,These wipes are a good size and have a nice fragrance. I thought they weren't wet enough but turning the container upside-down overnight brought the liquid to the top so the wipes were moistened. I am very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it to others.
2,1/4 inch ID?,"The inside diameter of this washer is not 1/4 inch.Perfectly good washer, just not the right ID."
4,Super Reader,"Even more romping in the face of those dastardly Frenchie anti-royalistcranium removers. Fun adventure. Lots of information on the beginningsand early adventures of the group that leads up to the ScarletPimpernel. Much capturing of the good guys by evil bad guys, threats,dramatic posturing, attempts to take away the women, desperatehorseback rides and war."
3,Average,"nothing special here. some good tracks, but no matter how hard i try to get into the music, i found this album way too repetitive."
5,I have the copies in a SAFE box,"I won the book ""elfstones of shannara"" in 7th grade during a book reading contest. As the runner up -- I was asked to reach into the carton full of books and select one. The books were on varied subjects but a good portion were on epic fantasy.The book's title ""elfstones of shannara"" along with the cover of Will Ohmsford holding the ""seeking stones of shannara"" guarding the elven girl amberle -- caught my eye. Till today I believe fate played a hand in my selection of this book.over the summer, I got hooked and the purchased the remaining two (before I learned of the heritage series).Now I have all 8 (including the King of shannara) and the other 4 or 5 books of the land over series. I look forward to the return of the Shannara series (or continuation).The copies that I do have are locked in my metal safe, labeled --""the books of magius"" along with my tolkien collection.Terry Brooks remains my most favorite epic fantasy/sword and sorcery author.rombios@excite.com"
5,Great toy for little boys,"My two boys (2 and 3) had so much fun with this toy! They normally do not enjoy long walks, but with this toy they just kept running for long long time."
4,ABSOLUTELY STUNNING - An Exerience of Music and the Sacred,"For me anyhow - this is Wagner's greatest gift - even better than the the Nibelung. Having played excerpts form the opera in amauture orchestral venues -- I can say that this work is ""Erlebnis"" (Experience). At once Wagner captures the piety of medieval Europe (now but a dim memory in an almost completely secular place), the foundational reverence of the Holy Sacrament, and essence of Christian grace. All of this with combined with was has to be one of the most moving musical scores of German romanticism. And thank you Met. Opera and James Levine for both re-igniting TRADITIONAL Wagnerian vision/stagings (and not those rancid ""revisionist"" directions), and making such respectable again."
5,spiritual journey,"This rendering of Parsifal is close to Knappertsbusch (1951 and 1962) in breadth and spirituality, and of course with this we get visual as well as aural. The singers do not so much act the parts as live, embody them. This performance -- what a lame word for what this really is -- is alive. There are no ""weak links"" here. I originally saw this on YouTube and had to order it. You will not see or hear a more inspired Parsifal."
5,JURASS STILL FINISH FIRST ...6 Stars!,"Lemme tell you...J5 has got to be the best hiphop group out right now. Not only are their albums dope, but they put on one helluva show. I saw em rip the stage to shreds at Humboldt State University a couple nights ago and I was blown away. If you have the chance, go see their show, YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED.As for ""Power In Numbers,"" the album's tracks are nothin but back-to-back dopeness that will satisfy anybody with an earhole. No matter what kind of music youre into, J5 will still please your musical taste. I cant really pick the standout tracks cause the whole album is standing out like a sore thumb in this sea full of wack hiphop fingers. Im feeling this album more than the last, and that one was a five star masterpiece. No fastfowarding on this one, there is no need... in fact you'll be yearning for more once the cd stops spinning. Dope [stuff]!"
4,its Aight,"this cd is alright. its good but not spectacular. i personally expected more outta them. good songs are ""if i only knew"", ""whats golden"", ""a day at the races"", ""thin line feat. nelly furtado"" and ""remember his name"""
5,An excellent follow-up,J5's second album will not disappoint. It's a little more polished than Quality Control and the songs are more diverse. They're still creating imaginative funky beats with socially progresesive and fun lyrics. I'm listening to it right now!!!
5,Jurassic finishes first,"Jurassic mixed their dope lyrics with a new set of innovative beats. There is more attention paid to sharp, new, and crisp mixes. Rates with the Quality Control album as one of the best in my collection"
5,Jurassic 5...Holdin on to What's Golden,"From the first to the last track, there is no doubt in saying that Jurassic 5 is the truth. This is the second major label release from J5 and they just keep raising the bar. Although 'Power in Numbers' is a departure from 'Quality Control' and the EP, the unique J5 flavor is still present. While 'Quality Control' was good, I truly believe that 'Power in Numbers' is light years better; it encompasses so much more and sounds more polished. I can't take this cd out the player--it's that good! It's definately worth the fourteen dollars PLUS SHIPPING! In fact, get two...give the other one to someone in desperate need of hearing something fresh."
4,GREAT!!,its an amazing cd the only problem i had with it was that the first couple of songs on the cd werent that good
2,I saw this one coming a mile away.,This album is ready for the radio. White people will probably love this. Go buy the new People Under the Stairs album instead.
5,Great CD,"This is the best CD i own and this is one of those cd's that all of the songs are good so there is no skipping through this one. J5 always sends a message on there cd's and to find the message in this one listen to ""freedom"" which is one of my favorites on the cd."
5,J5 is back!,"Jurassic 5 is the answer to What's Missing in Hip Hop. They continue and build on their Quality Control cd from 2000 and produce a great album. J5's teamwork is undoubtly the best in hip hop, great old school beats by Nu MArk and Cut Chemist, unique indivsual emcees and nice collabs, this album is destined to blow up! Dont expect any Ja Rule commerical rap on here, even if u dont like rap u'll love J5. Every song is dope with Remember his Name standin out. Cop This Album quick and dont be suprised when it blows up!!"
5,J5 dont dissapoint!,"i got this cd because 2000's quality control became my favorite cd when i got it.right now, i cant say that power in numbers tops quality control, but it is still an incredible album. i know that it will grow on me after a few more listens.incredible beats, more meaningful lyrics than quality control, and great harmonizing.the dvd is also great"
4,Jurassic[6]?,"Music is my life! If there wasn't music I'd die! I'm obsessed with hip hop. Just recently I heard a song on the radio called What's Golden. But as usual they didn't say who it was by. So I had to go online and find out. Turns out its by Jurassic 5! I'm real glad I was listening to the radio at that time. I only gave the CD 4 stars because it wasn't the BEST. The beats were awesome! Thanks to the two DJs backing Jurassic 5. The rhymes were pretty good. If you like old school, good old fashioned rappers, then I'd say get this CD. They aren't all bout sex, drugs, and money. They about giving a good message. One thing I don't get is the group is called Jurassic 5....but on the back of the CD case, they show [6] people. And I think that I hear 4 different people rapping on this album. So I might have missed something, but that's a little confusing. But forget that. Jurassic 5 is a must have."
4,Quality as usual,"I saw J5 when they came to pittsburgh last year, and they were pure fun. Theyre really beautiful to listen to, because theyre so pure and devoid of packaging or hype. Power In Numbers may not be as good as Quality Control, but that still puts it a notch above the rest. Real old school beats that sound like a boulevard in New Orleans just blew up. best racks are Break, A Day at the Races, Thin Line and of course What's Golden. My only complaint is that surprisingly I caught a few recycled lyrics. Other than that, truly golden."
4,it's the j-u-r-a-s-s-i-c,"jurassic 5 are back with a killer new cd.the only thing that keeps this from being 5 stars is the song ""one of them"" it is just not their style, they need to leave songs like this to the no talents,otherwise an incredibly good cd from the best group in hip hop in this persons opinion,fans of quality control and the ep should not even question buying this.enjoy!"
4,More like 4 1/2 for this bangin cd!,"Once again, Jurassic 5 puts out blazin' hip-hop material! I don't care if this cd sales 1 copy or a million, its awesome in my opinion. The first song ""Freedom"" is so real, its crazy. The entire album offers hot beats and tight lyrics. J5 is definetly branching out on this album. The only reason I rated it 4 1/2 is because I feel Quality Control was a better album. But this one is awesome too. Pick it up, its the best (music) to come out in a while."
5,damn,This is one of the best albums ive ever heard....it flows so smooth and is just so great...there is no doubt that is a must have album:)
2,A front for 2 good DJs,"Yes, Jurrasic 5 is a refreshing change of pace from the top 40 [songs] you usually hear on the radio. Although a good introduction to hip hop for the rock listener, there are more authentic groups out there. Cut Chemist and Nu-Mark do a great job as DJs, and I suggest checking out their solo work (as well as the original 1997 Jurassic 5 EP), but the rest is a bit generic. I'd look to such artists as El-P, Aesop Rock, or the classic Tribe Called Quest for something better."
3,Great design,"The design of this poster is nice, and it looks great from about 6 feet back. However, it's obviously a blown up scan of a used VHS dust jacket, and it's pretty fuzzy and scratchy when seen from close up. Anyways, a perfect addition for a high-school Science or English Lit classroom, and a great gift for kids or teens interested in outer space."
5,Rick Sue,An adventure into the world of fantasy firmly grounded in one girl's reality. Elise shows responsibility and the fairy demonstrates faithfulness in a new friendship. Beautifully illustrated. My kids love this story and have discussed it several times upon each additional reading. This book has also influenced them to draw and paint more.
5,Every shopper's dream!,"Whether you've travelled to Paris several times or are going for your first visit, The Paris Shopping Companion is a must. Shopping is a great way to explore the French culture and where better to shop than Paris.Filled with tips on what to take, where to go, how to calculate costs, and various other subjects, it is a handbook for any type of shopper. In its 3rd edition, The Paris Shopping Companion has been updated to include new stores. It includes bakeries, shoe stores, clothing stores, children's book stores, handbag and luggage stores, perfume and cosmetic stores and just about any other type of store you can think of. The best part is that the guide is equipped with a map, store hours, phone numbers and what type of payments they accept.Highly recommended!"
5,WOW what a resource!,"Wow...thats all I can say about how helpful this book was on my recent trip to Paris. I'm not one for guide books or anything of the like, but because of a ringing endorsement from a coworker, I bought this book hoping it would be something different from all the rest...Well boy am I glad I did! Not only did Winkler's book act as a roadmap for the paris shopping scene, it was also a pleasure to read. Definitely pick this one up if you are even considering a trip to the hope of the Effiel Tower, you'll be glad you did."
5,"The most interesting,comfortable and easy to use travel book","I have enjoyed using this book, and shared it with no fewer then six friends this summer who also traveled to Paris. At a recent book club meeting, we all agreed that Ms Winkler's book provides the most unique and pleasurable guide to walking, or shopping in Paris.I wish she (Susan Winkler) would right a guide to London!!"
1,A perfect example of why travel guides...,"should be updated annually. Several of the shops this book talks about are closed. It isn't a good resource for bargain hunters either. With some changes to the format and annual updates, my opinion might change...but it is very frustrating to be sent on a wild goose chase looking for a shop that no longer exists! Unless they do a 2002 version, don't waste your money."
2,For every pocket book?,I don't think so! Almost all the shops reviewed were $$$! My friend from Paris was shocked that the author would only list the very expensive shops. The book is very dry and doesn't get you psyched for the super shopping in the City of Lights.
2,"If you can read a little French, I have a better suggestion. . .","If you are looking for actual Paris BARGAINS, you will find Paris Moins Cher far more helpful than this book. even if you speak very little French, you can decipher enough to lead you to the real, hidden deals. And I should know -- as the best-selling author of 14 books of a similar nature (albeit to North American cities like Vancouver and Toronto) -- this Paris guide is really the ""competition."" I wish I had written a guidebook like Paris Moins Cher, but alas, I can only purchase it! As well, Paris Moins Cher is updated every single year, and believe me, that's important, if you are visiting only periodically, as things DO change quickly. I try to write updates on evalu8.org, but one person can only cover so much territory. Bon chance, et bon marche!"
1,"Very non-traditional, Califonia-style homes; few floorplans","Very non-traditional, Califonia-style homes; few floorplans. Very disappointing."
5,"Best Christimas LP ever (1 of them, anyway)",Merry Christmas to you. John Anderson brings Christmas straight to your living room. His cheer will remain all year with this special holiday CD. Now get the fire going!
4,Kool but a little confusing,beat goodlyrics goodbut was this based on something that happened to him like the death of someone in his clan or even Dr. DreI dont know anything bout dr dre so i dont know if he is dead or not
5,Ancient Haunting,"I have never heard anything like this. I listen to this each night, before I sleep. Never do I tire of it. Its so ancient and alive and authentic to me. Words cannot describe this music."
3,Too much cookie - too little fig,"Greetings,I purchased the whole-wheat honey fig bars based solely on the fact that the ingredients were healthy and the bars looked tasty.First, let me say that if you have tried the Fig Newton 100% whole wheat bars and are buying these as a substitute - don't.While Fig Newtons tend to be a little sweet for some tastebuds, these fig bars are mostly ""dry"" cookie with little fig filling and very little sweetness provided by the honey. The taste is okay, but not a product I would purchase again.Also, I was concerned that there was no best by dating on the package; since there are no preservatives there should be a use by date - how are retailers supposed to rotate product for freshness without this information?Given a choice between the Whole Wheat Fig Newtons and Maring fig bars, my tastebuds choose the ""Newtons""."
