1,"Walking (?) ""Stick""","At one inch less than 5 feet, this ""walking stick"" might better be used as a ""staff"" for when you meet Little John on that narrow bridge crossing a stream. It's way too tall and awkward to be comfortable. I own a number of walking sticks and am always on the lookout for the ""perfect"" one, whether I find it in the wild(where it's permissable to take), or in a store in downtown Manhattan.There is no close-up of this stick, so it's impossible to tell how ""finished"" or smooth it is, or if it is finished in any way at all. I've also found that a walking stick with a hole bored near the top to attach a cord or leather-lacing is very handy, as well as letting you ""personalize"" your walking stick with a bead or beads or even a small compass.I would rather spend the $20 at the local farmer's market the next time I go for a walk in the mountains, and perhaps find a hand-crafted walking stick there, along with a jar of home-made jam or pickles!"
3,"Collaboration: I'm Okay, You're Okay","IQU and Miranda July rock on their own... Together, it's another story. If you've never heard IQU or Miranda July before, please don't make this album your first introduction to them. But if you're a seasoned listener of both, it's not bad for the bucks."
2,casio keyboards and the brat,"miranda sounds like such a brat. when these two artists are seperate they sound much better. her other albums are quite amazing. don't know if i'll ever listen to them again. if you own them you know what i mean. this one was tough to get thru. take to the stage miranda, that's where she shines."
5,Wonderful!,I really enjoyed this ab workout. Allie is very easy to follow and cues her moves well. I was actually surprised at the intensity of this video. The workout moves were varied and the instruction on the video was great!
3,Jiggle free abs,"It is nice because it focuses only on abs and doesn't need any other tools etc. I take it with me when I travel around and it is easy to follow. It does work if you really stick with it, I do it three times a week and it is quite effective."
2,Arrived damaged,"This DVD arrived looking fine but was scratched. I don't know when it got scratched, since it was supposed to be NEW. It was a gift and I had to reorder from another company and give the gift after the birthday. The company did refund all my money."
4,recap of his efforts to assist the struggling church.,"fr werenfried has spent 50 years begging for funds for the persecuted catholic church. this book tells of his efforts to assist the shattered church in central and eastern europe right after world war II. through his work and that of his contributors and collaborators, the catholic church was rebuilt in germany and the countries of the former iron curtain. Good historical research material for ""what was everyday life like after the war"" and an inspiring portrait of what man can accomplish with God's assistance."
2,Disappointing,"I never before bought a book with so many typographical errors in it, which is unacceptable in this category of price. This is infortunate because the book covers topics which are difficult to find elsewhere."
2,Disappointed,"When we first got this toy, my daughter was 8 months old. She figured out how to use it right away and played with it all the time. It's been two months and the toy is broken. The sounds that play do not correspond to the activity taking place. For example, when she pops a door open it will say ""Good Bye"" and when she pops open the circle it will say ""rectangle"". I no longer have the receipt for this toy, so I doubt I could get a refund. I'm really disappointed because she loved this toy at first. She's not that interested in it now that I keep the volume turned off."
4,Daughter loves this toy,"My daughter has played with this toy since she was 7 months old. She is now 12 months and loves to hear the characters speak and sing. It is not too loud, which can be a huge problem with electronic toys, and has stood the test of a 3 year old."
5,OH SO CUTE! FUN FUN FUN FOR YOUR LITTLE ONE!,My daughter loves this toy. She plays with it for long periods of time - it really keeps her attention! It's one of her favorites! Looks like Leapfrog has done it again!!!
2,pointless toy,"My 13 month old daughter has 2 different kinds of these pop up toys. This one is quite pointless since she is able to open the characters without pushing any buttons. She is able to open it by pulling the lids. She does like the music etc, but it does not teach her on how to use it. The characters are also strange. My daughter wants to know what they are and I don't know what to say.The simpler version of this toy is much more fun and educational. YOu have to use the buttons to pop the characters. We have the farm version which has simple characters such as a horse, cow, sheep and pig. If you want to teach your kid how to push buttons and flip levers, go with the cheaper traditional pop up toy. Skip this one."
3,Pops open without needing to use buttons...,Neither of my children were interested in using the buttons to open the characters. The tops open up just by the children tugging on them so there was no need for them to use the buttons. I have seen other pop ups that do not open unless you push the buttons and I think that would be better. I do like the song it plays and my kids enjoy looking at the pop ups and the singing as well. It just doesn't teach them what I intended.
2,"A page-turner, but not mentally stimulating.","Although I enjoyed the basic story Routly presents in FIRE ANGELS, I felt that the plot and character development is lost amid wordy ""magical"" descriptions,vague political intrigue, and fantasy cliches. I also found the first-person narration to be rather tedious. Dion comes across as more of a sex-starved middle-aged widow, than a vibrant twenty-two year old woman. At times, the novel also employs minor vulgarity which seems out of place for the story's setting. I wanted to see more action in the middle of the book, instead of political drama."
4,Wow!,"This book, Fire Angels will suck you into adventure and excitement! Dion is living alone in a small village when her two brothers come pleading for her help. Since she is one of the most powerful mages they ask that she helps to find her sister. Finally after a lot of thought she agrees. In other parts of the world she is known as the 'Demonslayer'. Later when she meets with her family she finds that there is more terrifying things that have happened than she ever dreamed of. After meeting her family she discovers Shad. Together they must work to destroy the demons and evil minded people. They have to go through things that test their love and trust in each other, while Dion has her own demon to fight with. The path she goes down questions her name 'Demonslayer'. Is she really as powerful as she has been lead to believe? Have fun finding out the rest of this suspensful story! =)"
3,erotic and suspensful,"I found this book to be a delightful fantasy about forbidden and unrequited love. The tale is filled with many delicious scenes of passionate lovemaking which transported me to another time and place. However, despite these highpoints, the story left me cold."
3,Good but not great,"I read the first book in this series, MageHeart, and bought Fire Angels used on Amazon. In the first book, the heroine is a powerful mage, who is virginal but tempted by a demon. I was eager to pick up where the first book left off. However by the time this book starts we are told that the heroine has already taken a lover and is engaged in a relationship with another local mage. This was a surprise, since in MageHeart, she was so protective of her virginity with Andre/Bedazzer. I enjoyed the fantasy story, but the love story was dull. Our hero is too sappy and the whole thing lacks the romantic and sexual tension of the first book. I have bought the last book in the trilogy, Aramaya, and I hope the story will get back on track. I want Andre the demon to come back, and the heroine to dump her current love interest Shad!"
3,Fire Angels not as satisfying as Mage Heart,"I bought Fire angels shortly after having finished Mage heart. I found the book slow going in spots and found it did not focus as closely on Dion and her development as a person. Other characters in the book, I felt, also did not support character development as much as Kitten did in Mage heart. My recommendation, read Mage heart and wait abit before picking up fire angels."
1,"Lack of plot, inspiration, funding and talent!","Fans of the original film and the various books will be sorely dissapointed by this sad attempt at a sequel. Animation wise, it is about par with saturday morning cartoons. Plot wise the same (it would make a good saturday morning special if you can ignore the former). In general, this film offers nothing beyond the standard mediocrity of slick animated musicals for children under the age of 6...only it isn't quite as good as those. If you were hoping for the sophistication of O'Brien's novel, the charm of Jane Conly's sequels, or the brilliant animation of the first film, don't even bother with Timmy to the Rescue. As a side note, given as it barely lives up to films like land before time IV (!!!), it will no doubt be filed away as some sort of corporate blunder."
1,It stinks. Rent the original.,"There's really nothing more to say. It's an el cheapo ripoff of a great film, made to get a fast buck out of the children's video market."
1,Trashier than a Jerry Springer Episode,"The original 1982 film, THE SECRET OF NIMH was a masterpiece in the world of animation. It had lush colors, beautifully drawn, lovable characters and an engaging (and unique) story. This 'sequel' is a disgrace to the orignal film, and is more of the quality of a cheesy Disney afternoon cartoon. The story is choppy and it is evident that the writers did not watch the first film. I strongly advise you to see the original, but don't waste your money on this video 'sequel.'"
1,Yuck!!,"What a load of CRUD. The original movie was so full of emotion and beauty that it was a shock to see this horror. (show Mrs Brisbey art saying, ""dear God, what have they done?!?"")"
3,Not As Bad As IThought I'd Be...,"Not nearly as good as it's original Secret of NIMH. It's like watching saturday morning cartoons, really. I suppose everything seems a bit logically in place, but I don't know. This isn't a good sequel; not that I expected it to be what with the reviews. I was still curious and had to give it a watch. If you have a vhs player, it might not hurt to spend but a few cents. If not, don't bother I can't imagine they'd waste dvd printing on -this-"
1,"Why God, Why?","When I finally saw this movie, I at least had sufficient warning it would be terrible (in fact, it was leaked that it would have musical numbers and low-budget animation before the start of production!) This movie claims to be a sequel to the excellent Secret Of NIMH but instead looks and feels like a Rescue Rangers reject. Insipid, crappy and thoroughly cheap, It shows just how extremely desperate MGM really is to gain a share of the lucrative kidvid market."
1,Murder,It ruins the wounderful world of the first movie. Generic candy coated charicters who seem to think life is a musical for 6 year olds. A disapointment and a shame.
1,Absolutely horrible!!,"Absolutely horrible!! The MUSIC is ATROCIOUS!! Secret of NIHM 2 is nothing like the first movie and should not share its name. My son (now 5 years old) loves the original movie, but has no interest in NIHM 2. Please, don't waste your time or money!"
2,The Secret is <....................>,"The Secret of Nimh was a dark and creepy tale, full of adventure, excitment, and mystey. For all you fans out there looking to capture some of the magic from that first movie ....STOP!!! STOP NOW!!! Don't go here.... Don't rent this.... Don't think about this movie..... I promise disappointment......On the flip side....If you have kids...young ones.....who haven't seen the first movie at all.... This could be a renter...... Maybe a bargain bin type purchase.... Or maybe a gift from a well meaning grandparent...... I stress young kids...Note:I so rarely don't finish a film, but this one was shut off mid viewing. It just couldn't hold anyones interest.The only reason it gets a two star rating is because the movie was entertaining enough to keep 3 out of 10 kids from running amuck during my friends babysitting job."
1,"""Cameo""","This movie is a ""sequel"" to ""The Secret of NIHM"". By now Mrs. Frisby is nothing more than an old granny mouse, other than that it has really nothing to do with the original video. It has nothing to do with the book, again, just like the original had little to do with the book, and instead a cat with a blond top is thrown in along with an annoying caterpillar. Read the other reviews, this movie smells like gym-socks."
3,You're Lookin' At Country,"There is something about the Loretta Lynn story that has drawn me in and kept me interested in her life ever since I saw Coal Miner's Daughter - which happens to be one of my all-time favorite movies. Having also read the book CMD, I was tickled pink to find Still Woman Enough on the library shelf. I knew this would be a good read and I devoured this in a few days.I love the way this is written - Loretta is simply telling you her story, full of colloquialism and southern charm. She picks up where CMD left off and gives us more stories about her life in Butcher Holler, life during and after the making of CMD, her relationship with Conway Twitty, and the death of her son, Jack Benny. I particularly enjoyed her tales of life with Doo. Her recount of the days before and after his death were quite poignant.Yep, Ms. Lynn is still woman enough, and after reading this latest edition of her memoirs, you'll see why! 3.5 stars!"
2,"A sad, shocking story","Like so many other people I enjoyed Coal Miner's Daughter and found it an inspiring rags-to-riches story. Now that Loretta Lynn's husband has died, she has written a new memoir about the later years of her life. But the shocking part of this book is the stories Loretta left out of Coal Miner's Daughter about her horribly violent marriage. She also relates the terrible effect her husband's alcoholism and abuse had on her children. I must say I have far less respect for Loretta after reading this book - it's one thing to say that marriage is for better or for worse if you are the only sufferer, but I cannot believe any wealthy woman could make this choice for her children."
5,"Clear, Concise, Cogent presentation of NLP!!!","Having been a psychotherapist for over fifteen years and having struggled understanding sooooo many books on Neuro-Linguistic Programing, Dr. Laborde's book is a breath of fresh air. The topics are clear, powerful and practical in understanding and applying elements of NLP in improving communication. I can't believe the book has apparently been in and out of print as I consider it a ""Classic""."
4,Genie is very perceptive,I have taken classes with Genie Laborde as well as reading this book. She is in Palo Alto for those who are close to the Bay Area.She has many very useful techniques for making your life more free as well as more fun.
2,NLP (Neurolinguistic programing) was a fad,"I'm not a psychologist, but I majored in linguistics & minored in psych in college. Two graduate degrees since then and many years in the workforce. I can see why this programming was appealing at the time it came out, and I'm sure it sounds great when promoted by a Tony Robbins type. But nothing valuable here, just a lot of hype and some cartoons to keep the reader going."
3,not bad,"The first chapter has some really great observations and insights, then the author kind of fell asleep or ran out of ideas for the rest of the book, but chapter one was worth it."
5,"lovely cadences, startling images","I read this book from cover to cover without encountering a weak or ""filler"" poem, which is an unusual experience for poetry readers today. What beautiful, haunting images! Among this poet's greatest accomplishments is her ability to use everyday vernacular and natural imagery in a fresh, evocative manner. These childhood memories become the reader's own--accessible yet mysterious. Highly recommended."
2,weak first collection,"Vanessa Haley's first collection of poems is a rather weak one. The language is more or less uneventful and flat and the poems are unremarkable. That isn't to say that there is nothing good about this collection. The opening poem, about a photograph of her mother, is a really good poem (which gave me high hopes for the rest of the collection) and there is a great poem on the death of her cousin, ""For My Cousin, Found in a Ravine"". But there are so many better collections of poetry you can pick up instead."
5,How could you not love King Kong?,A great book of a great movie about a great story. From the mid 1930's to the early 2000's a story that will live on forever.
2,Unclear details,"Does ""20 brush"" mean the item's 20 inches long [actual leingth's rather important]?Can it be used safely on the car's body painted surface [I need something to scrub off bird droppings on the car's roof]?"
3,Too Old,"Past Dummies Books have been very helpful; unfortunately, at age 87-years, this use too current procedures and wordstock for me to use. I need step by step as others have provided but sharper minds will find this one very good, I am sure."
2,For New Windows Users Only,"If XP is your initial Windows OS, then this is for you. For the user with post 3.1 exposure, there is little here that surpasses what you already know."
3,Windows XP for Dummies,"I known I am new to computers; that's why I ordered the book; HOWEVER, I am floundering still - going through the book; I think I need something even simpler to start really getting around on this thing. Thanks a lot for your interest, and.... Amazon is great for getting product out and received. jt"
4,windows XP,"In 2003 received microsoft windows xp as gift when I purchased computer, however turning book pages started falling out from binding so recently purchased windows xp for dummies. A lot of good information I have not had before, still learning. Wm Smith"
2,Good but really dated,"I liked this book, but I have to say unless you don't know how to move around Windows then this book is not for you. This book is well written and is nice to read, but an update would be nice. If this does not satisfy you might want to try Windows for Dummies."
4,"Windows XP for Dummies, 2nd Edition",A good reference book for people having basic computer question. I found myself flipping around as one answer would lead me thinking of another question which was easily found in another chapter.
4,The Dummy Helped,"I have a friend who is in her 80's, relatively inexperienced in computers and dependent on grandchildren to help, that is when she could find them. I saw this and sent it to her. Her comments were very enthuiastic. She claims that it substituted for a grandchild quite well on several occasions."
5,A great aid to windows!,I gave this to my husband for Christmas and he says it is wonderful. He recommended it for my daughter as well.
5,Windows xp for dummies,"I like all the (for dummies books). They are simple and easy to read and contain a lot of great information. I have been reading books like this on eveything from computers, the internet, to world religions."
4,Windows XP for Dummies,Have only had it a few days but it has been most useful. Saves me from having to get help from my grown kids.
4,Good product.,"The bo0k was in excelleent condition, and was just what I wanted. It has been useful as a reference, and I still use XP and expect the book to be useful in the future."
2,Only if you're new to Windows,"A better title for this book would be ""Any Windows for Dummies"". I bought this book because I am new to XP. Some of the reviews including one from an ""IT"" person stated that there was good information on XP specifically.I found it to cover a lot of basic information on how to use Windows such as ""start"" button, icons, and control panel. Another example is the Networking chapter which in essence says ""use the network wizard"" and little else. It is well-written and methodical in its presentation of the subject but the subject matter is very basic. If you are an end-user that is comfortable with any version of Windows from 3.1 on, you will likely be unhappy with this book."
3,Not That Good....,"I did not find the book that helpful. A lot of times, the information in the book does not match the information on the window menu, task bar, etc. I had to lesrn through trial and error. I thought this book would help me to avoid that. It did not. I am still learning through trail and error. The book seems to be outdated, and it is a disappointment to me."
2,wINDOWS xp mANUAL,i FOUND THIS VOLUME NEARLY USELESS AND WAS VERY HAPPY TO UPFRADE TO wINDOWS 7.Way to wordy to quickly find the information that I was seeeking.Sorry but this is not a good buy
4,Windows XP for Dummies,"Fine, except do feel that the book is a bit ahead of the reader and that assumptions are made that the readers really aren't Dummies - and in my case I am!"
5,Windows XP for Dummies,"Purchased Windows XP for Dummies for teaching purchases. I bought it USED, and was concerned about the condition it was in. I was truly happy when I received it. The condition is like brand new. Very satisified customer."
4,"Good Information, Easy","Found a way to get out of the trouble I got into very easily in this book. Have not gone through the whole book yet, but it is very well written and easy to read."
1,Wrong part,I was geatly disappointed with this part. It was not even close to the same part that fits my Jeep.Had to send it back for a refund!!!!
2,Tedious Despite Great Cast,"I loved ""Murder on the Orient Express"" and thought ""Death on the Nile"" was OK, but this, the third of the big-budget Christie movies of the late 1970's disappoints. There is some bitchy dialogue between Elizabeth Taylor and Kim Novak, but it passes quickly and the boredom fills in just as fast. Angela Lansbury as Miss Marple does her Jessica Fletcher bit but overacts to beat the band, complete with a cane and her knitting. Rock Hudson and Taylor, playing a Director and Star as well as husband-and-wife could not have less chemistry. Miss Taylor often appears glassy-eyed and lethargic, perhaps she was drunk. Tony Curtis could have had a great time as the sleazy Producer but his role seems to have been cut. Novak starts out strong but disappears midway through the film. The murderer is obvious and the film plods along for an eternity even after the who-dunnit is clear. Skip this miss."
2,"First Rate Cast, Third Rate Movie","I bet this movie sold instantly in a pitch meeting. Imagine some of the biggest stars as characters in one of the most commercial murder mystery series ever. Unfortunately the script creates cardboard characters and the plot has no subtlety or intrigue. The actual movie isn't as good as any of the previous Miss Marple movie incarnations or subsequent TV versions. For some reason her character is absent for much of the movie. If you're looking for a good ""modern"" Christie movie then buy Murder on the Orient Express."
2,Not to Good,"I don't know where they found this movie, but it wasn't very good at all. Good cast, but it was like a ""B"" movie. In fact where are you finding these movies Amazon?"
3,Not the best Henshaw mystery but worth a read,"It's Halloween and the body on the floor of new library could be just a joke, but it isn't. Later on, the body of a well known TV anchorman is found stabbed the same way on his front porch. Susan naturally starts to investigate and is joined by her old friend and now the new police chief, Brett Fortescue.As usual, I enjoyed this mystery. Ms Wolzien always tells a good story. I was annoyed by two things. What sane woman lets a stranger and a rude entourage invade her home, and why wasn't the rude, insensitive and nosy neighbor Amy Ellsworth thrown in as a murder victim? I certainly wanted to dispose of her by the end of the book."
3,Not The Best of the Lot,"Although I enjoyed reading this cozy little mystery in a few hours, it certainly wasn't one of Valerie Wolzien's best. I found a lot of redunancy, loose ends, and out-and-out glaring errors. Still, I did enjoy the book.When Susan finds a body at the library, you know it won't be long before she's involved in the murder investigation. Then when a talk show host is also found murdered on his doorstep, Susan just allows herself to be bambozzled into having his widow and her TV group stay at her house. Why? She doesn't even know her. The obnoxious, nosy neighbor is bothersome in more ways than one.Despite all this, it was an enjoyable read for an evening if you just forget about nitpicking."
2,Disjointed and poorly resolved,"While this book had a lot of interesting components, I didn't feel they were brought together very effectively. There were several annoying loose threads that were never properly addressed, and much of the character interaction just left me scratching my head. Normal people, even normal people who find themselves embroiled in murder investigations, just don't act like that. Or if they do in that part of the country, I don't think I'll be planning any visits there. The whole town was just too precious, and I have a hard time feeling pain for a woman who constantly complains about how hard it is to raise two children when 1) they're pretty good kids, 2) she doesn't have to work outside the home, and 3) her husband, whom she frequently neglects in order to flirt with the local lawman, brings home a handsome salary that can easily resolve the vast majority of minor family problems."
1,Where's the book?,"I got the cassettes which were OK, but in the recordings there are frequent references to a textbook such as ""You are now on page six"". However, the textbook was not included in the package. I e-mailed Language Dynamics asking about the textbook clearly indicating that I was willing to pay extra for the book if neccesary. I never got a reply. A lot of reviewers have said that the book is not needed. Maybe so, but I would like to see what the words look like so I would recognize them in print. Besides, it is poor service to have ""You are on page six"" in the recording and not provide any information on how to find the book."
2,Not worth it...,"I seriously question the quality of the tapes. I purchased my tapes, and found that there are different kind of strange noise in the recording... The courses of the tape also, I would say, pretty disorganized. Do not think that you can reach upper intermediate level of French after finishing these tapes. I think that the tapes are not as seriously made as other language learning audiocourses.For better tapes, I recommend ""Learn in the car: French"" series. The quality is clearly much better. It is cheaper too. If you do not care to spend lots of money, I recommend ""Pimsleur"" series. Pimsleur is by far the best, and it is extremely user-friendly.In a nutshell, I found many audiocourses better than ""AudioFluency French""."
5,"Effective, Fast, and Easy!","I found Audio Fluency French to be the most effective French course that I have yet experienced, and I have been searching and trying recorded French courses since 1972. From my observations what makes this course unique is the method that teaches you to speak so much practical French within minutes of first using the course. This course has improved my accent, increased my vocabulary, and shot my functional fluency sky high in just a few weeks. The tapes were more professional than the average with a relaxed tone which in turn helped me to relax. The learning guide REALLY helped to clarify and explain, although I didn't really need it to look up English meanings since those are all given on the tapes."
5,Used for Xterra Lift,I got these because I had Control Arm (UCA) contact when I installed my spacer/shackle lift on my 05 Xterra. Solved the problem and shipped fast.
5,Finally I get this progressive classic,I wore down my tape version of this fantastic dutch group back at the end of the 70s... lost all hope of ever seeing the record or the cd in market.. now its here in Amazon.. what?? you never heard of Trace?? does progg rock mean anything to you?? now add that with the most pure jazz sounds as well..just to have as a testimonial of a past period is worth it
4,Good Book for Queueing Theory,"From the context of a network engineer with basic mathematics training, this is a useful book but a little tough going at first. However, with a little help with a more introductory book on Markov chains and stochastic processes I quickly started actually understanding and using the concepts in the book. It gives a very good insight into the operating characteristics of queues, especially with regards to Slotted Aloha. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone with a more than casual interest in queueing theory, but be prepared for a little hard work if you have limited training in probability theory concepts."
5,Great gift for weekend musicians,"I bought this for my dad on his birthday and had it shipped directly to him. Since he got it, he can't seem to play without it. Just recently, before his birthday, he bought an electric guitar. He has only played acoustic for the past 6 years. Now he never touches his acoustics. Next time, I'll have to buy one for myself.I would recommend this item for any musician looking for an economical way to play his favorite tunes."
4,What Can I Say -,- It Rocks!!! [makes Air-Guitar passes through air above keyboard] Be sure you read the instructions when you are not tired...
5,"As I remember, this was a good one","Let me be the first to review this briefly. I remember seeing this film years ago and was quite moved by it all. One man, who's family and life is destroyed by the US government takes his gettin' even with the 'powers that be'. In a futile attempt, the main character seeks to expose and destroy the very thing that is evil. It is a story of a modern day 'Don Quixote' who tries to battle the Federal Government and fall short of his mission. George C. Scott was a great, phenomenal actor; and I remember this film to be great and phenomenal as well....similar to 'Soylent Green'....one lone American striving to end the misery of the modern world."
2,Not worth buying,I have recently bought the game and I am very dissapointed with it. I have noticed that sometimes the zombies are invincible and I can't hurt them at all............. waste of money I wouldn't buy it. Also im not used to having to press a button to get ur weapon to come out. ( which you have to do)Believe me this is one game your better off without.
3,Every review is right,"The controls are hard to learn at first, but you get use to it. I found the controls didnt work as well as other games for the DS. Maybe it was just me. All in all, it can be a fun game but hard to learn at first."
1,A thing of patches,"What a disappointment this was - does cobbling together bits and pieces of incidents from many well known blues works into a patchwork held together by the thinnest of narrative and barely developed characters qualify as writing a novel? At the back the author lists many of the works from which he lifted the incidents for this ""novel"". My advice is to go read them and forget this mishmash."
4,Review for Canon Sure Shot 115 w/Zoom,The Canon Sure Shot 115 w/Zoom is a great choice for the price! We took all our vacation picture with it right after getting the camera and were afraid of what we might get. We were pleasantly surprised. The features and zoom were easy to use and the quality of the pictures and lighting were excellent. We will use this camera for a long time to come.
3,Cannon Sure Shot,I was slightly disappointed as it was bigger and bit clumsier than my old Sure shot. I was pleased to be able to buy it as they are all digital now.I was shocked that I had to go and pay 20 to pick it up from the parcel depot and thought it was a hoax but it was customs and exise duty.Apart from all that I am pleased to have a straight forward easy to use camara as a standbye that won't need charging all the time or run out of memory etc.
1,Don't Waste Your MONEY!,"I agree with the previous post. I had to reconstruct my gift basket upon arrival. The plastic wrap was ripped, & items had fallen out. I was also annoyed at the amount of ""chocolate""--2 after dinner mint sized samples. Lame! Don't disappoint your friends & family--order a gift basket from a company that specializes in such products."
1,Same experience as everyone else,"The packaging was ripped open, pieces were damaged. It looked like it was damaged prior to shipping because someone taped a box of cookies to the outside of the packaging on the opposite side of the tear. The basket was too small to hold all the products to fix it on my own. Amazon shipped a new one out right away though so that's a plus and I'm hoping it's not damaged. Very disappointing though."
1,crashes my computer,"I have used windows 2000 pro for years and I never got blue screen crashes. That all changed when I installed the latest CA security suite. Within the first 30 minutes of installation I had two blue screen crashes. PC Magazine warned about this instability and I should have taken their advice. I uninstalled the security suite, and I demanded a refund from CA."
1,Slows web surfing to dial up pace,"My Norton was expiring, and there was a great deal with this when purchasing any tax software (at a local office supply store). Uninstalled NOrton, installed this, and what a mess. I have high speed broadband cable, and web pages load so slow (forget about video) I may as well be back on dialup. Never had this with Norton. I wish I could un-do this purchase (believe me, I'll try)"
1,CA Internet Security Suite 2007,"I spent 3 days solving Firewall issues, it was blocking certain websites and unable to read my E-mails from Windows Live Messenger.Also I noticed that it sloved down my browsing.The Chat support did not solve the problem, they suggested to take the paid mode.It used to be an excellent Antivirus program, with this new version they blew it, needs to go back to the design board.Sorry CA but I'm not your customer for this year and it was removed from 4 desktops / laptops that we own."
1,Problems!,"I bought the three computer version of CA Internet Security Suite 2007, which, as it turned out was exactly three computers too much. I downloaded the Vista version. (Although the box says 2007, the program doesn't know about Vista.) I spent most of a day trying to get the program to let me access the Internet -- adjusting every variable in sight, rebooting, etc. -- and finally gave up. I then tried to uninstall it. Vista said it couldn't uninstall it! Although I've manually deleted most of the files now, there's still stuff in the registry. Enough said?"
2,Going from great to horrible,"I've been using Computer Associates anti-virus and firewall software for years. I always liked it because of its small footprint and easy-to-use interface, especially the Zone Alarm based firewall. I upgraded to CA Internet Security Suite 2007, expecting more of the same, and instead I got a bunch of annoyances. At its default settings, the firewall blocks my Windows Live ID sign-in, my printer and file sharing, and even major Web sites like the New York Times. After a few days of trying to tweak the settings, I'm ready to look elsewhere for Internet security solutions. Computer Associates should have played by the ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" rule. Now, based on my own experience and other reviews I'm reading, they are going to lose a lot of long-time loyal customers. Sorry CA. I'll keep my fingers crossed for 2008."
4,Good Stuff Great Value,I have been using CA or E-trust (it's the same) for three years. I always buy the Cd's from Amazon. I delete the old and install the new. I have never had any problems. Everything works as it said it would. I have never had a virus. The anti-spam works every time and is easy. The firewall has a catche cleaner that is very good. All you have to do is take the time to tell it what to do. It's a very cheap way to protect your computer. Don't forget to disable all the other security features from your ISP and Windows firewall.
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"I have been running this product on my machine for 4 months, and am replacing it with CyberPatrol. The parental controls are worthless, and do not work effectively. The software is CPU intensive so the cooling fan runs consistently. One may as well not use the schedule for updates, as it won't split across IDs within WindowsXP causing your machine to lockup. I was really disappointed, a CA has good software within the mainframe environment.I will avoid using CA within the MS-Windows environments going forward."
1,Run for your life,"This worked fine until one day I tried to update the virus patterns and it failed to install the package. From that point on the virus engine would not initialize. The ""support"" is chatting a back an forth via a web interface with a script jockey (guy who is reading instructions off of a prewritten script and has virtually no idea how the software actually works, but he or she is going to give you instructions on how to fix the problem). I have been through 5 sessions and 8 hours, with absolutely no result, each time starting all over with a new support person. Also, when you get in a jam, CA will have you MANUALLY remove the software which involves finding files and erasing them while windows is in safe mode and locating and erasing Windows registry entries/keys in the regeditor, not for the PC novice. I give CA support a -10 on a scale of 0 to 10."
1,What a piece of Junk.,"As soon as I install this software. Most of the Ajax website won't work anymore, yahoo, netflix. And it only have safe and restricted zone on NIC interface instead of network zone, which is very inconvenient for laptop user. And they want to charge for support. I will never buy any product from CA."
1,Horrible,"This product will cause more harm than good to your computer. The firewall totally blocks you off from the internet, it slows down the computer, it uses up way too much resources, it cannot be properly uninstalled, and the customer service is poor. This product is highly un-recommended. It not even worth the time or money. Do not buy this software, you will regret your decision of investing in this product."
1,Slow as dial-up,"I installed this software, then uninstalled it less than a week later. It slowed my computer down so much I felt like I had dial up internet service. Just starting the computer took so long that I would walk away and come back later to see if it was up yet. Everything took SO long. I couldn't stand it!I did leave the e-mail filter portion of the software on my computer when I uninstalled though because it does a very nice job of filtering out all the junk mail I get. That's the only good thing I can say about this software!"
1,Waste of money.,- Outdated material (math and english)- No explanations for answers- Best info was word for word from free CBP study guide- Reasoning more geared toward Border Patrol test- No table of contents or organization- Very confusing and poorly compiled
3,Just OK,"The product doesn't justify the price. Although I wasn't dissatisfied with the performance, there are other products that are just as good for a fraction of the price. I've tried so many facial cleansers and personally think the results of Amla are very similar to Clinique's foaming cleanser. They both leave that squeeky clean feeling. I don't mind splurging for excellent facial products, but they must be truly fabulous. The Amla cleanser simply is not."
2,Very average,"Let me begin by first saying that I am a big Pulley fan and have every one of their albums. However, I must say that this album follows the last two in which it dissapoints. Not to say that it isn't any good but it definately lacks the luster found in Pulley's first two albums, Esteem Driven Engine and 60 Cycle Hum which are still two of my favorite punk albums since I started liking punk back in 1990. Esteem Driven Engine is definately THE Pulley album to buy. They need Strung Outs Jordan to return..."
4,uNF uNF,"I loved this album. Pulley really stepped it up in my opinion. I like everything from Slayer to Mxpx, but these guys hit the spot. Somewhat of a snowboard bum, i'm drawn to the classic ""we're not going anywhere"" attitude of punk and this album brings it to the table. Lots of new approaches to producing, and some bad religion -like chorus combos. interesting album, one i enjoyed from start to finish. especially track 2, 4 and 5."
3,almost perfect,"This was exactly what I was looking for. I great replacement for a Nylon spoon, made of silicone so that you can grab all the sauce in the pan. The silicone is firm in the center due to a metal loop inside the silicone, but its flexible around the edges to fit contours... almost perfect. The only problem is that the handle is too flat, making it uncomfortable and a bit hard to manuever. If you have very small hands, it might be OK but for me its a dealbreaker"
5,"Old songs, sweet memories","I've not been listening to some of the songs in this album for a long time.They bought me back to my teenage time.So sweet, so exicited.I love the music forever and ever."
3,Much smaller than I thought,"The lampshade itself is very pretty, but it was way too small for the lamp. I wasn't able to use it. I didn't check the measurements, as I should have. Don't be mislead by the photo, always measure!"
4,Useful implementation (and design) tips.,"This book contains a number of very useful columns from the recently deceased C++ report. I found particularly useful the articles on implementation of assignment operators, exception safety, and the inner workings of the standard library containers (Gillan, Austern, Sutter). Actually, they are all really about exception safety - clues on how to write robust code that I needed to learn.The introduction to Lakos' Large Scale Programming tome was also a useful tipoff about physical architecture: I've been using Rational Rose for about 18 months, and now have a better overall picture about what the component diagrams are trying to do apart from represent the receptables my classes get put in.A rule one might apply is: if the cost of the book is less than your time spent to remove the errors you'd make if you didn't read it, then buy it. This one passes the test with ease."
4,Beautiful!,"This album really shows the beauty of Sibongile's voice. Both intense and floaty, you'll find yourself putting it on loop. There's one song, number three, that is a little cringe-worthy, but without it this would be a definite 5. Enjoy!"
1,"Miracle on 34th St , something is wrong with this DVD I hate following the tips and guidlines, does any one have a free choice?","something is wrong with this DVD, not happythe title is Miracle on 34th St , have I not done this correctly according to your rules?"
5,Favorite movie,I ordered several copies of this movie before Christmas to give to nieces and nephews. I kept one for myself. The movies all arrived in excellent condition and very quickly. This is my favorite all time feel good movie and I watch it at least once each Christmas.
5,My favorite movie of all time!,"When I was little and watched this movie no one could tell me that Santa was not true when he sang to that little girl in Dutch it made me so excited it took my breath away that's the magic that all children rich or poor should grow up with, even poor my parents always kept the magic alive for as long as they where with us."
5,Wonderful! Life is NOT black and white! It is as colorful as you want to make it!,"THIS is the best, most heartwarming version of this classic Christmas movie. To have it colorized is the icing on the cake! Don't hesitate to purchase it!!!"
5,Miracle on 34th Street,Love this movie. It's a must see every year at our house. This is a classic movie. Packaging was great.
5,The origional Santa???,Watch this movie with children. The will along with adults believe in Santa. What a great Christmas movie. Great Blu-Ray edition.
3,False Advertisement,"This is one of my all time favorite movies, and as usual I watched it on TV over the holidays and it was in color, which I thought was great. I went from store to store in hopes of buying this DVD, in color, as a gift for my grandchildren, but was unable to find one. Then I saw it on Amazon and the picture on the cover of the DVD is in color so I assumed the movie was in color also, but to my disappointment it was the old black and white version. If the cover picture of the movie had been in black and white, I would not have bought it, I think it was false advertisement."
4,Good Movie..,Great movie got it fast! Got it as an addition to the orginal one.Just like this movie alot. Colored version just not as good.
5,Miracel on 34th St,"This is my favorite Christmas Movie. I watch it several times each year. The only movie I like better is It's A Wonderful Like, Starring James Steward (Black and white version is preferred)"
1,a bad message,"I threw it in the trash. It's about a young girl and her motherwho give very sensible and logical reasons for not believingin Santa Clause. Then a man who thinks he is Santa Clause convinces them that it's OK to believe in anything you want ifit makes you feel good. The lawyer is the only cool character in the movie. This lawyer ""proves"" in court that the man is Santa Clause. But he doesn't really prove anything. It only proves that lawyers and twist things around."
2,Disc must be faulty,Disc was advertised as being colorized but played only in black and white. Opening menu had a red banner but that was the only color in the entire disc. I tried everything I knew to do but finally gave up.
5,Good Christmas story.,"Certain movies have kind of become a tradition in our family. We always watch ""Christmas Vacation"" on Thanksgiving night, then between Thanksgiving and Christmas we always fit in ""Christmas Carol"" (1939 Version), ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"". It wouldn't be the Christmas season without them."
3,Classic but they just talk through the whole thing.,I loved this movie as a Child but watching it with my 6 year old niece - they just talk through the whole film and we were both quite bored until the final moments. There really is not a lot going on if watching it with a little girl.
4,Wife's perspective,"For lovers of Gerald Durrell, this is an interesting book. It looks at the their romance and collecting trips from her perspective. Does not give any insight into their difficulties and troubled marriage, however."
5,"The ""Oldies"" are often the best!","A fantastic movie when it first came out & a fantastic movie now! Everyone of our young people should see this & 1) be reminded of how we fought in WWII, 2) see some of the best performances by some of our (now deceased) greatest actors, & 3) realize that the ""old"" movies are just as good, if not better, than our present day movies! James Cagney, Jack Lemmon & Henry Fonda always put their heart & soul in their roles & this movie is a wonderful combination with the 3 of them! Comedy, tragedy & pathos combined. Highly recommended!"
5,Great Movie,"This is a great war movie although it's not about the aspect of war that we usually see in Hollywood. There's an explosion, but it's not from enemy action. You see aircraft carriers, battleships and destroyers but they are off in the distance. This movie is set on a cargo ship (of all places). It deals with the efforts of one man trying to get into the war and his battles with his tyrannical commanding officer who was played brilliantly by James Cagney.I'd have to say the best scene in the movie is when the SP guy is telling about the things the crew did on the island during liberty. But the coolest scene is the look on James Cagney's face at the end of the movie.This one is one that I can watch over and over again."
2,Review is of DVD - Not the movie,"Given the ""classic"" status of this movie, it seems meaningless to discuss the content for this review. Thus, I will stick to reviewing Warner Brothers DVD release of the film.First, I commend them for the inclusion of the excerpt of an Ed Sullivan ""Toast of the Town"" (1948) tribute episode featuring the movie's stars. This was really interesting viewing.However, for the movie itself....this is the worst Warner release I have seen since ""National Velvet"". The picture frequently becomes out of focus, and the picture is often very undefined throughout the whole movie. There are a couple of places in the movie where the picture jumps, as if the film from which the transfer was taken ""skipped a sprocket"".Overall, this is an embarassing release of a classic movie....despite the great extras which are included. Warner needs to go back to the drawing board on this one."
5,Great movie,Mister roberts is an awesome movie with relevance for all. One of the great movies of all time at a great price.
1,MR.ROBERTS,"I BOUGHT THIS AND GOT A BLANK DISK.I RETURNED IT AND GOT A NEW ONE.UNFORTUNATELY I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL TOO LONG TO RETURN THE 2ND. DISK WHICH WAS ALSO BLANK.IF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING THESE COPIES OF THE FILMS HAVE NO QUALITY CONTROL,IT MAKES ME WONDER HOW MANY PEOPLE LIKE ME GET SCREWED.SOMEONE SHOULD CHECK OUT A DISK OR 2 TO SEE IF THEY ARE OKAY.MY GUESS IS THIS ONE SLIPPED BY YOU BECAUSE THERE PROBALY WASN'T A LARGE DEMAND FOR IT.I'M SURE IT WAS A MANUFACTURING ERROR BUT I WON'T BE ORDERING ANY MORE DISKS FROM YOU.I HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF GOOD THINGS FROM AMAZON BUT ONE SCREWUP I CAN LIVE WITH TWO SCREWUPS I TAKE MY BUSINESS ELSEWHERE.SINCERELYEDWARD H.STEWART JR.71 YEAR OLD VETERANP.S.MR. ROBERTS IS A CLASSIC FILMWHO COMES FROM THE OLD SCHOOL."
5,Superb DVD transfer of a movie that stands the test of time,"Mister Roberts on DVD is high quality and worth the price. When I view this movie on Cable TV -- TNT or TMC, it's the old matted version that has poor color and grainy images. The DVD is in it's original theatrical format -- the images are razor sharp, the color is splendid and the sound is crisp and clear. Plenty of special features too!Of Course the story of a ""Citizen Soldier"" Rear Echelon Naval Officer wanting to get into the action of the great WW-II before it ends is what this DVD is all about. Director John Ford and Mervyn Leroy capture the boredom, tedium, quarrrels, and at the end the tragedy of the heroes who were unseen and unsung during WW-II. A great ensemble cast with many actors from the John Ford Stock Company(Ward Bond, Ken Curtis)."
5,Mister Roberts,This is a classic. Terrific actors and great story. Still entertains after all these years.
4,A classic clean movie,"This movie is a classic. It's an enjoyable show without the foul language and sexual agendas like today's movies. It's just good clean fun to watch. The actors have true talent in entertainment. I love Jack Lemmon in this one. He's his usual comedic self. When you feel like watching a good old movie with a simple plot without the expletives and other dirt that comes with many of the modern shows, you'll love this one. I wanted to get the sequel ""Ensign Pulver"" also, but I'll wait until it comes out on DVD."
2,Poor quality video,"loved the movie exactly as I remembered it decades ago. Entertaining, funny, a different look at what was going on in WWII. But the Quality of the dvd is horrendous. I think if I had VHS of this movie it would be better. Was not worth the couple of bucks I paid for this. wish I could return it. Can I?"
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,This flashlight is way over priced and not half as bright as my OLIGHT and it's less then half the price. Maybe its just the model but this flashlight is NO way worth the money. Im happy mine was a gift and I didn't pay for it. The only good quality it has is durability.
5,Better Brush to clean car rims (Don't think so),"If there is a better brush to clean the inside of your car rims it must be in another planet cause on this one, this is the best for that specific job, it's great at holding it shape through out the cleaning process, and is completely ready next time out it feels as though it could go strong for years on end."
5,The Real memories of War,"My husband received this book as a gift, not my usual reading i have to admit, but i was the first one to read it. In my opinion this book should be in everyones bookcase, it should be passed down for generations to make sure all know what really happened in the War. I loved the way it went from making you laugh to making you cry at the turn of a couple of pages, all done with the fantastic writing. This book was a real joy to read and i am so glad i did."
4,"Okay Edition, Easier for Younger Reads than the Original","We would be hard pressed to find people not familiar with A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens, due to several movies the novel has spawned. I finally sat down and read the novel and am glad I did. The novel by the prolific and popular Dickens is well-written with great characters. That the author can generate such imagery and fully-realized characters in such a short story, is a testament to his staying power. This book packs an emotional punch, and is a great tale for the holidays, or any time you need to remind yourself to be thankful for what you have and those around you. A classic story and a must read. 4 star version of the book as much of the original language has been changed."
3,JUST LIKE BURNING BED,"This is a reasonably well done movie, but if you ever saw the movie ""The Burning Bed"" with Farah Fawcett, this is almost identical with Indian actors and actresses. Nothing wrong with copying I guess, but it has been done before. This version is no better or worse than the original."
1,Piece of Junk,"It provided 45 mins at most extra power supply (and that was for word processing only...forget about video). It tended to drift into sleep mode and power down which was annoying. I cant prove it but I also think it may have damaged my laptop battery. After about 9 months the thing died and the company would not honar the warranty.Do not buy this, throw your money down a well instead."
3,Holds oil,"I wouldn't buy this item again. Two reasons. 1. Still to small, 20 qts would be better and 2. It doesn't have a vent plug, so when the oil drains from your oil pan into the funnel the air is trying to get out as the oil want's in. You get a bubbling effect which splashes small oil drops every where. I end up draining into a regular oil pan and transferring to this container for transport. I guess I was spoiled. I had a large oil container that heald about 20 to 25 qts with a vent plug. I could easily do my bmw (6.5 qts) gmc (7. qts) and civic (4 qts). But sadly it sprung a leak after 15 yrs and I had to put it down."
5,try to buy usa,"I owned one like this before & was happy to find another one. It works great for what I use it for,(Lawn Tractors, Lawn Mowers, Pressure Washer, etc)."
2,Good and not so good,I ordered 2 of these and when they arrived they were as I expected with the exception that one of the tanks was missing the yellow screw cap. I contacted the seller and left voicemails but have never heard back from them on the missing piece. Product will work fine and a telecoping catch funnel would help get it closer to oil drain hole on the trucks.Would have ranked it higher but non response from seller is a major issue for me.W Craig
1,Falling Apart!,I purchased these sneakers for my wife for Christmas. She has many shoes and has only worn these sneakers about 10 times. They are coming apart at the seams! There is a 3-inch tear in the outside material in the one shoe and a 1-inch tear in the other. Definitely a manufacturers defect! Avoid!
1,not given enough info,"So, maybe I am just a little dumb, or didn't look hard enough, but no one mentioned that you had to buy over $500.00 worth of equipment to use this dvd. I just wanted something that would get me into shape at home and heard Stott Pilates was the best. Wasted my money on this one, although I am sure it is a GREAT workout if you have the proper equipment."
4,Provide understanding of the narcissistic mind,"This is the best written and useful book I have read on narcissistic personality disorder. This book is written for the non-specialist reader that has to deal with such people in everyday life. In simple and clear terms the author reveals the mind of such people, and covers a lot of ground although only briefly from how to identify them, its origin in childhood, how to defend ourselves and in particular at work, in love relationships, with our adolescents and with aging parents. It also gives a few words of how our modern society contributes to it. This book is written in an entirely non aggressive tone, although I have seen some authors trapped in negative reaction to such people, and which makes this book even more valuable. This book helped me greatly understand narcissistic people in my family."
4,A LIttle Short In An Urgent Department,"This book is excellent, wish it had been around a few decades ago. However, the author very nearly implies that the narcissistic parent would have to be a violent, antisocial type for the adult child to justify imposing distance. That's like saying your spouse has to beat you bloody before you are justified from walking away from an abusive marriage. I wish the author had discussed deliberate estrangement as a way of opting out of a hopeless parental relationship that isn't physically violent. More adult children who need to do it might have felt better about it. There comes a time when we must all ""let go"" of our children, no matter how feckless and troublesome they are. The same is true for our parents even if they are older and feign helplessness. Believe me, if they know nothing else it is how to take care of themselves."
5,Fantastic!,"I loved this book! It really helped me to understand the Narcissistic Personality Disorder and helped me find better ways to deal with it and changes I could make both in my behaviors and my ways of thinking. It has changed my life and empowered me. I highly recommend it for anyone seeking to understand this disorder/behavior better, and anyone who wants to re-examine life in general."
1,narcissism,"I am pretty open-minded when it comes to my thoughts on books I have purchased. If I have learned SOMETHING new from the book, I am pretty satisfied & feel I made a good purchase. I was disappointed with this book. It did tell alot about what a narcissist is, but not much about how to deal with one of these characters. I would not recommend this book."
5,And the fault wasn't mine!,"This book truly helped me understand some disturbing people in my life. I know better how to ""deal"" with them without feeling used and torn apart. Thanks for the most helpful book!"
3,It is Ok....,"This book provides really great descriptions and will help you understand what narcissism is, but it provides little help regarding how to manage being in a relationship with a narcissist. It is worth a read, but you'll have to find something else to help you manage in a close relationship with a narcissist."
5,Exceptional Book,Why Is It Always About You? : The Seven Deadly Sins of NarcissismThis book clearly describes the behaviors of the narcissist so you can recognize the ones in your life. The author points out the problems we have when we deal with them in a way that is compassionate and yet points out why we get involved with them in the first place as well as ways we can change our interactions with the narcissists. As soon as I started I couldn't put the book down.I also learned how they got to be this way and what triggers their problematic behaviors. This is the best book I have ever read on this subject.
5,"The book has become my ""Rosetta stone""","I have read some other books on this topic but, for me, everything was so on target that it seemed the author must have been living in our marriage. I had so many questions because so many things just didn't make sense to me. Now I haven't been able to think of a question that is not answered in the book. It is a freeing feeling when things have answers that make sense and are consistent. It has made a huge difference for me and is helping me immensely move on with my life."
5,Guide to Survival,"The literature about narcissism is rich in scholarly, obstruse, discussions of psychodynamics, etiology, differential diagnoses and other unhelpfulissues.It is poor in down-to-earth, practical, ""how to cope"" manuals. I should know as I amthe authorof ""Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited"", another tome on this subject.Thisbook contains a rudimentary overview of pathological narcissism and thenproceeds to identify thetraits and dysfunctional behaviors of the narcissist - replete with hundreds of examplesfrom the author's mental health practice. It then proceeds toprovide check lists,tips, and advice on how to cope with this destructive and perniciousphenomenon. Along needed and long missing work."
4,Why is it always about YOU ???,"Interesting book to own. Needed it at a time of 'diagnosing a relationship', and this book hit the (proverbial) nail on the head! Gave it to my girlfriend, who also appreciated and used it to her advantage at a certain stage in her life. But - aren't we all narcissists to one degree or another?"
3,A Narcissist?,"The book held my attention in chapters1-3, with the description on the first few years of life, and what family and behavioral patterns (especially the mother) brings about the narcissistic tendencies. The how to deal with a person (be it a family member, a spouse or a boss) with the narcissistic personality is not as helpful as it could be. The examples are weak- and the case studies not complete. Non-the less I do recommend the book; it is easy to read and the author does accomplish the complicated task of brining light to this hard to understand topic."
2,Too Judgemental,"If you're a student of psychotherapy I expect this book would be very helpful, it's easy to read and understand and has some great case examples to help understand how narcissism `works' in real life. You will also be better equipped to make your own mind up about its style.Sadly I felt that it could be very unhelpful if you have to personally cope with a narcissist or if you have narcissistic problems yourself that you want to deal with. There is a judgemental tone throughout the book that if mirrored in contact with a narcissist I believe is likely to be highly counterproductive.In the chapter 19 ""Narcissism and Society"" we get a clue that this tone may resonate from the writers conviction that narcissism is raging in society due to lack of respect for ""...religions that are based on the authority of God..."". Perhaps we all need to be a bit more judgemental and the narcissists will all fall in line? If only it were that simple..."
2,Repetitive Writing,"How worthwhile can it be to read a book where the first nine chapters are devoted to the exact same material, with the only variance being in the sentences and words chosen, but not in the concepts presented? In a nutshell: Ms. Hotchkiss believes that the childhood years from 0 - 2, with a little bit of age 3 sprinkled in for good measure plus parental incompetence equal a narcissistic child. Isn't this a bit simplistic? Only upon reaching Chapter 10 does the material diversify away from the childhood blame game. However, the tone of simplistic thinking continues. If you know absolutely nothing about narcissism, perhaps you will enjoy this book. If you are dedicated to the concept that parents are responsible for every childhood dysfunction, then you will surely enjoy it. If you think the world is more diversified than that, you will surely feel at least a tinge of irritation."
2,Why Is It Always About You,"The book provided insight into the Narcissistic disorder, what to expect & examples on how to deal with the party. It was knowledgeable & well written....I would recommend it."
5,Why it is NEVER about me!!,"WOW!! Excellent book! I recommend this to anyone who has controlling, narcissist, manipulative parents or spouse. I personally have given this book to several women whose parents doted on the sons and ignored the girls...and girls dealing with the narcissistic spouse and/or boyfriend...It has changed my life and made me realize that I must stand up for myself and say ""no more"" to those who insist that I worship them and be their scapegoat!! It is a book that will make you say ""Ohhh, now I understand.."". It is what ""Toxic Parents"" was years ago!! A MUST READ!!"
2,There are better Narcissism books,"I have read a lot of material on NPD, and this book was not as helpful as some others I have read. In fact, the over-emphasiss on shame in this book had me convinced that my ex was not a Narcissist. It wasn't until I had read the DSM-IV and Malignant Self-love, which empasize the lack of empathy, lying, and lack of emotion as key diagnostic criteria. The intimate psychologal portraits in these other books have me convinced that not only was my ex a Narcissist, but a TEXTBOOK case. If I had just read this book, I would never have known."
3,Why is it always about you?,"""Why is it always about you"" is about recognizing the narcissism in yourself and coping with the narcissism in others. The book is not just about Narcissistic Personality Disorder which, the author says, is rare, but rather about that fact that we all have varying degrees of narcissism ranging from healthy tendencies to malignant mental illness.I am unconvinced by the author's psychoanalytic theories regarding child development but some of the more practical advice on coping may be helpful. The last section, ""Only you can prevent narcissism"" is about how moral relativism, the misguided self-esteem movement, and certain parental attitudes have largely contributed to the raging feelings of entitlement so pervasive in this narcissistic society in which we live. This section alone is worth the price of the book."
3,It Works,"This starter was only 69 dollars, seems to be of decent quality, fits and works just fine.....but be aware it's made in China."
4,Beautiful Atlanta,"This is a very scholarly book, and as such, is very well researched. The images of the homes are wonderful, and I appreciated the included plans for many of the homes. Reid's homes are classics, they are built in many of the favorite styles of the affluent. He is probably best known for his Georgian homes, that fit the beautiful northern Georgian Piedmont perfectly. If you have any interest in great residential architecture of the first half of the 20th century or just have a love for Atlanta, then you will thoroughly enjoy this book, and as the other reviewer stated, it's a perfect book to get ideas for your own home, uh, but I hope you have the requisite deep pockets."
3,NOISE,After the install they settled in and are now making a squeaking sound that comes when I am slowing down/manuevering at a low speed. Overall they are good but I expected more from KYB...oh well
3,MacLeod's writing is engaging,"This is another great biography by Elizabeth MacLeod. For magic lovers, this book gives all the details and interesting facts of Houdini's life. MacLeod's writing is engaging and works wonderfully with the illustrations giving children a richly textured biography for their age-level.A word of caution: The tricks depicted in this book are dangerous and parents need to discern whether or not their child will try to imitate Harry. Not for advanced younger readers without parental guidance."
4,"Lovely, but she repeats it elsewhere","This little book is a beautiful presentation of how Benedictine principles can enrich the lives of non-monastics. One warning, though: If you're going to buy her book ""Acedia & Me: A Marriage, Monks, and a Writer's Life,"" don't buy this one. ""Acedia"" is a further exploration of all the material in this book, and (as she acknowledges in the preface) some of the text is identical."
2,Expected More,"If you are looking at buying this DVD because you want in depth info on how to use your GPS/Fishfinder - think again. Only the most basic functions are explained. It does not cover overlay data, Sun Moon Calculations, accessing MMC files, Route Planning - I could go on and on. Be smarter than me - save your money."
2,From Back Cover,"For the sake of the baby...Maura Chambers needed help with her unborn baby. Doug Connelly wanted to make up for a friend's bad judgement. Not the best reasons for marriage, but enough to make Maura and Doug say ""I do.""It was to be a marriage of convenience, to get Maura through a difficult time. But how, then, could she explain the hungry look in Doug's amber eyes, the longing she felt during their nights together? The handsome doctor's hands made her feel nothing like a plain Jane nurse but rather like a wanton, wanted woman. Everything was within reach- a husband, a family. Until she discovered Doug's little secret...[5th in Dynasties: The Connellys series]"
1,Wrong gloves sent,I was very upset the gloves sent were not the ones pictured. Also I had to pay shipping back to get a refund.
4,"Great book, Great Story",This is a well written book about one of the most dramatic small ship actions in the history of the US Navy. I reread it every few years and always enjoy the read.
1,"Mixed Media, Bad Form.","This book takes facts about those who served on the ""Aaron Ward"" and incorporates them in narrative as if they were fiction. The result is 211 pages of local color and 52 pages about what befell the ship off Okinawa. The author portrays relationships and the ship's culture, but a less tedious strategy would have sailors tell their own stories. A tribute to brave men on a brave ship, but in a form where prelude overpowers battle."
4,The End of the Line - Rochester's Subway,"A wonderful trip down memory lane for me and also for my family. Raised in the Rochester, NY area in the '50s, I can remember the excitement as a child riding the subway. To watch the changing scenery as Rochester changed during the course of the video brought back fond memories. For anyone with Rochester connections, I would highly reccommend this video."
4,Informative,"As a Rochestarian, I think this is a bit of our history that we should not forget. For example, if someone proposes a new light rail system, what can we learn from the last time we tried and failed?It's also a good general example of what happens when government tries to get involved in transportation. Sometimes it works (Erie Canal, NYC Subway) and sometimes it doesn't (Rochester Subway, Rochester-Toronto Ferry). Can we tell why?Nice production.I especially enjoyed the DVD extra of the promo film produced in the early 1950's."
1,Disappointing,"This is not a very thoughtful or well-conceived book. The chapters jump from outdoor landscape lighting to individual lampshade projects to electricity safety and so on. The directions for the individual projects are slip-shod and many of the finished works looked to my eye to be flimsy, kindergarten-ish and nothing you would want in your home. There is evidence of haste, lack of detail and of over-all conceptual follow-through on virtually every page. Definitely not recommended."
4,GOOD TV FOR THE PRICE....,"I HAVE OWN THIS TV FOR OVER A YEAR.NO PROBLEMS SO FAR...THE PICTUREIS EXCELLENT IN HD AND DVD; MORE ""NATURAL"" THAN THE EXCESIVE ""TECHNICOLOR""LOOK MOST TV'S FROM WELL KNOWN BRANDS HAVE.CERTAINLY THE SOUND FROM THE TV ITSELF IS VERY POOR;BUT WITH THE MONEY I SAVED NOT BUYING THE ""TECHNICOLOR"" FROM THE OTHER BRANDS;I GOT MEA GOOD SURROUND SYSTEM FOR DVD'S AND FM.THE AFOREMENTIONED SYNCRONIZATION PROBLEM BETWEEN THE PICTURE AND THESOUND IS TRUE;EVEN WITH SATELLITE TV.I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT AND IS SOMEWHWATDISTURBING.MY FINAL WORDS ARE:IF YOU HAVE EXTRA CASH ON HAND AND LIKE ARTIFICIALTECHNICOLOR PICTURES;BUY THE FAMOUS BRANDS..."
1,2 years TV SHOT,White vertical lines suddenly appear call tech support (which was good) and told display panel bad and costs as much as new tv. It really aggravates me to pay $500 and have this happen less than 2years old
1,Westinghouse Lemmon,"A Westinghouse LTV-27w2 purchased December 2005 seemed to have been an excellent buy until the power supply quit on November 2007. It has been so far impossible to have the set repaired unless I accept and agree to a $150 to $450 repair estimate, plus shipping charges. Stay away from Westinghouse, historical big name reduced to fly-by-night operation."
1,Same Problem! Power Source dies Right After the Warranty Runs Out,"I just had EXACTLY the same problem as another reviewer. I bought the TV in February of 2006 and in March of 2007 (1 month after the warranty runs out), the tv died. Westinghouse tech support suggested I buy a new power cord which I did and it still didn't work. They then told me it is probably the power supply module and I should send it out to be fixed.The Westinghouse tech support people were very nice but told me since it isn't under warranty I'd have to pay to fix it. I agree with the other reviewer who said this is far too expensive a tv to be a throwaway. It makes me very suspicious when products die just outside their warranty periods, especially since this exact same thing has happened to someone else. I own a few other Westinghouse products that have been fairly reliable, it could be that this specific model is defective. If thinking about purchasing this model- I definitely would NOT."
5,"great tv, great value","picked up this tv for the bedroom -- very good deal, great picture. the ONLY complaint i have is with the menu. it takes multiple steps to get to the sleep option or switching inputs. even so, the complaint would be classified as minor. the pc inputs are a great added bonus."
2,Lips not in synch with sound,"This TV is inexpensive and the picture quality is good. The only problem (and it's a big one) is that the picture and the sound is often not in synch, so that the lips don't move in synch with the words. BIG PROBLEM."
4,Decent television,Got the tv on sale so it was a great deal. High quality picture and amazing sound. Only down side is there is no spot for an HDMI Cable
2,Black levels are terrible on this set.,"This was my first LCD purchase. I fired this thing up and at first was blown away by the beautiful bright picture. Then a dark scene came up and everything looked like a washed out grey. This set can not do blacks. I have tried everything from brightness, contrast, and backlight adjustments to no avail. The response time for gaming is poor as well with ghosting and smearing all over the place. I guess you get what you pay for, but the black levels of this unit are not acceptable to me."
1,DON'T DO IT!!!,"THIS BOOK IS GOOD FOR TOILET READING, BUT NOT REBUILDING ENGINES. WORTHLESS BOOK FOR ANYONE WHO HAS EVERY BLUEPRINTED OR REBUILT AN ENGINE. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
5,A Greatest Collection - Sort of,"While not agreeing politically with MO, I certainly admired their passion and great music. This CD is not a greatest hits collection, but rather a collection of favorites as if picked by the fans of MO. It includes ""Progress,"" ""Hercules,"", ""Cold Cold Change,"" ""Redneck Wonderland"" among the 18 selections.After Peter Garrett left MO went downhill somewhat, but this CD shows the band at its collective height.BUY THIS CD - PLAY IT LOUD."
5,There can be only one.,Fact: Doctor Who is the longest running sci-fi television show. Not Star Trek!Tom Baker is the best Doctor! Without a doubt! I hope BBC puts all the Tom Baker shows on DVD! Thanks BBC for making it this far!
5,Another classic from the Tom Baker era,This is one of my favorites and would mark the end of producer Philip Hinchcliffe's work on the show as well as season 14. This would also mark the end of Leela's first season on the show although she wasn't there for the whole season. John Nathan-Turner who would become a producer later on joins the crew here. The story itself is set in Victorian England with The Doctor dressed as Sherlock Holmes. This story has also drawn alot of attention for it's display of what some consider racist attitudes towards the Chinese with the show actually being pulled off of some channels. This is a show that the pc police certainly wouldn't let be made today.
3,Cool movie cheap SFX,I really enjoy Female action movies but this was nuts! some footage looked older than the movie itself. One part a Helicopter hit a mountain and exploded that footage looked like something from and Old war Movie. I wish they would use something that didn't look so old.
5,States of Denial,"""A Little Matter"" is worth reading simply for its discussion of the term ""genocide"". But there's so much more. If I get started I'm going to blather on at extreme length, so I won't.The content of this book has been well covered by the reviewers before me, so I simply want to add my 5 stars. If you're interested in the issues suggested by the title, you've found an insightful, solidly referenced, powerfully argued resource.Ward Churchill has an axe to grind, certainly, but he also has a forest to cut through. There are so many lies abroad in the world that we are all choking on them, I think, both victors and victims. This is a book I'm grateful to have read.Stannard's wonderful and terrible ""American Holocaust"" is another. As are John Pilger's ""Secret Country"", and ""Blood on the Wattle"" by Bruce Elder, both of which concern Australia, my own sad, similarly haunted homeland."
2,Haden Stumbles,"A major disappointment for a big Quartet West fan. For any other group, this outing isn't at all bad. But Haden and Broadbent are taking themselves so seriously, they've forgotten that the lyricism, interplay and spontenaity of their previous albums is the source of this group's genius and artistry. Here, in this overproduced ego trip, everything including the album and song titles, jacket photo, ponderous orchestrations, re-arrangements of previous ideas, classical knockoffs, schmaltzy lyrics, unrelenting ennui, and Haden's own crooning crawl down Opry Lane smack of pretention and self-indulgence. I'm more than willing to allow it's totally sincere, but what's left? Even Ernie Watts is uninspired. Charlie, bring back the ""old"" Quartet West."
2,A major disappointment,"Having enjoyed virtually every Charlie Haden recording for years, I must say this effort with strings and vocals is a lugubrious disappointment, dour and funereal in the extreme.Slow tempos, lazy arrangements, mannered vocal stylings by Bill Henderson and uninspired work by Shirley Horn --- this one has very little to recommend it.And it hurts me to say it, because Charlie Haden is a real master."
2,A real disappointment,"This CD is disappointingly boring and uninspired if you know some of Charlie Haden's other work. Whenever something interesting is being performed by the wonderful Shirley Horn or Charlie Haden, it is killed by an overdose of strings. It's a real shame."
3,Nice but dismissable.,"Haden's pleasant miscellany of neglected but deserving ballads is indeed a mixed bag, but somehow his focus, purpose, and method elude this listener. Neophyte writers are frequently enjoined to compose with a sharp, definitive, unified ""thesis."" Haden could have used a bit of coaching along these lines before producing this collection. Even drawing upon a common composer (as opposed to ranging from Kern to Rachmaninoff to public domain) might have provided the needed coherence to the project.In any case, it's always a welcome experience to hear Shirley Horn; the revival of a touching ballad like ""In Love in Vain"" merits our appreciation; and though I was never a big fan of Bill Henderson (an acquired taste), he deserves to be recorded based on the evidence of this recording.In sum, this album is more than anything else a ""sampler"" and should have been priced accordingly."
4,the art of the song,"Sophisticated, elegant...ranging from ""supper club"" sounds (shirley horne's vocals) to melancholic storytelling (Henderson's ballads) to lush, thematic and original instrumental compositions (Broadbent)...the CD will sound overstated and relentless to some, but for those with an ear for vocal subtlety, impeccable composition and the finer aspects of the art of song, this CD's a must-own."
5,powder fresh drops for dogs,I found powder fresh fragrance drops for dogs very useful for the dog that doesn't like the spray or aerosol. They last a few days and are easy to apply either to the dogs back or the bandana. I used it on my own dogs and it seemed to work really well.
4,love to read,"Pretty good read, although at times it read like a fiction instead of someone's life. I like the author and look forward to seeing more of his work in the future."
4,The Jury is Still Out,"The product was shipped very quickly and was the right price. I'm not sure yet if it had any effect. I did notice, however, that where I put the product down most heavily (around the outside foundation of the house) that the mice did not move back to. I would always fill their holes and usually they'd all be dug out again within a week. This time they (2) kept to the area where I put down the least, they always now stay in that area. I haven't had a chance to put down new product in that spot and redo the rest."
4,cool game,i think this is a great game IF you like turn base games amazing cell shading and very well done story line its a great update from the first one
1,A major step back in the Metal Gear series,"I got this game, played it for 15 minutes, then never played it again. This is absolutely NOTHING like the other games. Who in the heck wants to be able to only move 4 spaces and take silly ""turns"" with the enemy?There is no free movement in this game and the action is a big zero.Worst game to date I have ever played. I don't see how anyone can rate this game well. It is about as fun as checkers. And since you are only allowed to move a few spaces at a time and use stupid cards to do certain actions, it plays like checkers.Don't waste your money on this game. I sure did."
3,Good for a portable game system,Anybody expecting the usual hollywood experience that is synonymous with Metal Gear Solid is gonna be disappointed. It uses a playing-card system for everything from movement to attacks. You get cards that have specific actions on them and then you use those cards to perform the action it specifies. It's very different but it is by no means bad. It can be very addicting and is perfectly suited for on the go gaming where you might only have a couple minutes to play then have to put it away for a bit. I have not finished the game but from about 3 or 4 hours in I would probably only have paid like 15 dollars max for this when it first came out. Now is the time to pick it up if it interests you in any way.
5,Outstanding Technician Resource,Finally! Jahangir Moini organizes and delivers a thorough text for candidates interested in Pharmacy Technician Certification. The information develops throughout the text to build an outstanding review of all areas necessary for mastering in pharmacy technician certification. A pharmacy technician working through this text will successfully master skills needed for a superior performance on the exam and in the real world of pharmacy. It is the best resource for the technician that wants to learn and understand the material needed and not just memorize and hope for luck!
1,WORST exam review book,"Incorrect information and incorrect answers in EVERY chapter. Terrible book to study from, info is unorganized, and still confused on what I should study on. DON'T BUY!!!"
3,CD Rom not useful !?,"I bought this book some time ago, way cheaper, and the CD worked fine with Windows XP, but that's not the case with Vista; you can only see part of the question, which obviously makes it hard to guess the answer. It's pretty frustrating. I tried the compatibility wizard and a few other tricks to no avail. I emailed the company and this was their reply:From: Delmar Help (delmar.help@cengage.com)Hello,This software is not compatible with newer versions of Windows such as Windows Vista. It was made in 2005 when Vista was not released.RegardsMatthewTechnical SupportCengage Learning, DelmarMonday - Friday, 8:30am to 5:30pm EST800.648.7450 Menu Option #5, Option #2nothing else, no fixes, updates or anything. It doesn't say so anywhere."
1,Why do I HAVE to give it a star?,"I have six and a half years experience as a hospital pharmacy technician. This book is absolutely worthless. He focuses on things that are not that important and breezes through the stuff that time should actually be spent on. As far as the review test, one of the questions is, ""What is the most important duty of a pharmacy technician?"" Two of the options were filling prescriptions and protecting themselves and other from bio-hazardous materials. I chose the obvious one, filling prescriptions. Apparently, my job description has been changed to human bio-hazard shield. I hate you Jahangir Moini."
4,How to study and pass the pharmacy technicians exam,"The American education system with it's continuous assessment model does not teach how to take and pass an examination.Professional examinations like the pharmacy technicians exams lent themselves to a different study model. This book provides the materials and exam practices that ensures certification.I highly recommend, I was able to avoid my employers study sessions by reading this book and passing the examination in record time."
5,PTCB exam prep,"I found this book to be the single, most helpful, tool in preparing for my Certification exam."
1,A mix of random info with wrong answers to go with it,"This book started out good, but then it took a big turn downhill when at least 2-3 answers per chapter were wrong in the section review questions, its very frustrating. The book is also not presented in a way that would prepare you for the test. It doesnt say what is needed knowledge and what is background knowledge, i really dont recommend this book unless you intend on studying random things and getting frustrated with wrong answers and a horrible practise test cd."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"I got this book and was very dissapointed to see all of the typos and mistakes! For exapmle, Chapter 2 answer key says that 5 of the answers are ""E"" and there is no ""E""!!!!! Only the normal A, B, C, or D. There are math mistakes, contradictions, and several answer key problems! I am very dissapointed with this book and the publisher because they will not do anything about it! Do not waste your money!"
1,Frustrating and distressing.,"This is easily one of the most difficult to use textbooks I've ever had the misfortune of studying.Many review questions are confusing or badly worded, both in the book and on the practice exams on the CD. On some review questions, the subject is never even brought up in the text, sending me to Google to find the answer or guessing the best I can. Also, some topics seemed unnecessary to know, or were repeated. Very confusing and frustrating!"
5,Moini books are a success!,"I have purchased previous books from the author Moini and they have been a great success in my opinion! All his books, along with this one are extremely helpful in the pharmacy field. Well organized, easy to understand, with useful information makes this book an A+. I strongly recommend it along with any other books written by the author."
2,zero cueing on the cardio sections,I was just using this tape and ended it half-way through to write a review. The cueing stinks and is frustrating. I am just getting back into exercising after a few months off and have been using Firm tapes on and off for about 15 years. This one seems effective but annoying because there is no cueing. Stephanie changes moves constantly and just says the name of the move while she is doing and it is SO FRUSTRATING. You want a work out where you actually work - not waste your time trying to read the instructor's mind and falling all over the bench!
1,Connie Johnson,This video is to fast paced with moves changing to frequently to keep up with. I didn't feel it was working arms hard enough. I didn't like that I needed a step device in order to do the workout.
2,Not my style of workout,"I don't like this video because after I am done with my cardio I want to pop in a tape so I can do a quick 10 min muscle workout. This is one workout, no choices. You also have to wait for a commercial to get over with before it starts. They also use a ""step"" through a lot of it and I doubt a lot of people own one of those."
3,No cueing!,"I decided it was time to start exercising again after taking 2 years off after the birth of my son. I've used the Firm tapes and DVDs in the past and thought the new Jiggle Free series would be a good place to start. I also loved that the tapes in this series are around 30 minutes each - perfect for me to do while my son has his afternoon nap. The Jiggle Free Arms DVD is challenging, however there is absolutely no cueing during the aerobics sections. I am familiar with what The Firm calls each move, but the instructor gives no cueing to let you know what to do next. I've been using this DVD for a week now, and I still have difficulty with the aerobic sections because of the lack of cueing. I usually end up doing my own thing while trying to keep my heart level up. But I do find it challenging and I feel like I've gotten a good workout, despite tripping all over myself and the Transfirmer."
2,JIggle free arms,"I have been using many workout DVDs over the years and have pretty good luck with them (mostly buns of steel ones), so I saw this Jiggle Free Arms and saw that it had decent reviews, so I ordered from Amazon.com. I am not the most coordinated, yet not a complete stiff, but I found this DVD hard to follow and it moved too quickly, w/out cueing or anyting, for me. I felt I got more cardio from trying to keep up with the moves, which is good, but not the area of my interest. Also, they use this 'transfermer' thing, that cost an extra 30-50 bucks, during the entire workout in various ways. It looks beneficial, but not willing to spend the extra money and I feel like I should have been told there was equipment required with it. Needless to say, there it sits on the shelf,probably will never be used again.... Where as I use my buns of steel three and 10 minute workouts all the time.Good luck~ hope this review helps someone."
4,Good little unit for the shop!,"Rock-solid KVM that switches audio too! Well-made unit that sits on the bench well. I only wish that the cables were about 12"" longer."
1,Just didn't work for me,"I had high hopes for this KVM switch; unfortunately, my hopes were quickly dashed. A standard HP keyboard and mouse, when directly connected to each of four different computers, worked with no problems. When connected through the TrendNet KVM swith, none of the computers (Vista-64, XP Pro-32, and two Red Hat Linux systems) could see either the keyboard or the mouse.I can't say if the audio functioned, as without a keyboard or mouse, the audio didn't matter.One star for Amazon's great customer service; none for the product."
4,This is really helpful,"This is really good quality product, and protect my baby's face when she wants to scratch her face. The only thing is that the fabric is a bit thick. If you want to use it in summer, that's maybe too hot for baby."
2,Not so great!,The mitts were not so great. They prevented scratches for only minutes as they flew off as soon as my son moved his arms around. They look cute on that is the only reason why I gave the mitts 2 stars.
3,Okay,I bought this for my daughter after a cheaper version (bought on eBay)turned out to be junk. These are okay but still had lots of bubbles and sticking problems.
5,BEST SCREEN PROTECTORS EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought these right when they came out for twenty dollars on the black market. At first I thought that's a lot of money for a screen protector but boy was I wrong. I don't think I could live without these. Do yourself the favor by buying these. It's a fantastic price. If you don't buy these get the puck off this page.
2,taught the rubber would be stiffer,i taught the rubber would be stiffer the engine shakes to much it was not a good choice for me
1,A Rudimentary Review of Modern Art,"I would tend to agree with the first reviewer back in 2004. All in all not an impressive book. Most definetly not worth the price $$$.We like art books, and love modern art books. We have had an opportunity to see both the 4th & 5th editions of this large modern art history book. There is not that much difference in the contents between the editions.In this case bigger is not better. Indeed a large tome. But the contents seems to skim over the various movements in the world of modern art. Indeed all of the modern artists are represented. But the information about them is rudimentary.As a suggestion not a recommendation one might consider 'Shock of the New' by Hughs. Hughs Omitting many an artist nonetheless the reader gets a fuller feel for each movement and how it entrenched itself into the fabric of its time."
3,Nice looking but not as functional,"This is a high quality product, but is not very ergonomic. The handle is not comfortable and the silicone end is a little too thick. It would have been better to make the silicone thinner to make it easier to get under delicate fish."
5,OEM part,this is just as described. a door switch for my linclon conential;. it fixed the problem of the interior lights not shutting off and turning off the radio when the door is opened.
2,Skip it,"While this book provides detail to what everyone knows (the Stasi spied on everyone, including the sixth of the population that worked for it) it offers very little else. Missing is any sense whatsoever of the psychological effects of living in this kind of society or any kind of nuanced understanding of what it has meant to confront these files. Ash gives some small indications of what his own responses were, but as a Westerner who expected to be spied on for his activities, his experience is not very instructive. Garton Ash has many things to be proud of, but this book is not one of them."
1,Not His Place To Judge,"This is a book by a privileged person in a totalitarian society. Mr. Ash was able to travel back and forth whenever he chose. Others, not so lucky, were stuck in East Germany, and various pressures were brought to bear on them to inform on Mr. Ash's activities. Mr. Ash has now gone back and reviewed his file, and then confronted those who informed on him. I don't think he has any right to judge or embarrass these people, who lived in a completely different world than he did. I was very uncomfortable reading about these confrontations, and eventually just put the book down. Had the author been an East German dissident, who put his freedom on the line for what he belived, then he might be in a position to judge these people."
3,Quick start that trails off,"Mr. Garton Ash writes very well and his idea of tracking down those who informed on him to the East German state very clever. The book starts with several dramatic scenes and the powers of the State Security police are well delineated. It is simply incredible to reflect on the resources that this police state invested in surveillance and tracking of a student. However the actual confrontations with the informers are somehow disappointing - perhaps it is just the author's matter-of-factness. One has the impression of a padded out magazine article (although less than in the author's ""Magic Lantern""). Personally I would have preferred to have had more experiences of other victims of the Stasi recounted and a more comprehensive overview added."
4,Call of the Wild made kid-friendly,"Want to wean kids off television with a great classic? For kids 9-12 this book should do the trick. Jack London's story of a family pet who becomes a sled dog in Alaska gets heavily edited and simplified by a very competent editor. An illustration on every other page keeps even the most reluctant young readers on track. I'm an elementary school librarian who is reading this book aloud with five classes of 5th and 6th grade students and they love it! (The only reason I didn't give this book a full five stars is that the longer, orginal version is still the best--if you are a more mature and patient reader.)"
5,It's speaker carpet,"No backing, gray easy to work with. When you order more than one for example 2, you get the combined length of 2. In case you where wondering."
4,Dr. Numbers Demolishes the Myths about Ellen White,This book explodes the myths surrounding Seventh-day Adventist prophetess Ellen White and her health reform visions. Dr. Numbers pulls back the mysterious curtain surrounding this woman's life and reveals the true sources for her health messages. This book is all the more credible because it was written by a former Seventh-day Adventist professor of Medical History at Loma Linda University. A must-read for any Seventh-day Adventist serious about learning the truth about Mrs. White and the sources she used for her health reform teachings.
2,"Just buy the camcorder, adding acessories does not add value","I am pleased with the picture quality of camcorderwell, completely dissapointed with the acessory kit though. I was expecting it to have the essentials and the kit does not contain fire wire cable!Buy just the camcorder, not the acccessories."
5,Wayne Hancock is a genius!,"There is a quality to Wayne Hancock's music that is difficult to describe. The restless feel of the southwest, the precision of the music, making it hard to believe that it was recorded live in studio; yet understanding that it was the only way it could sound so perfect. Someday Hancock will be recognized as the genius he is. Wild, Free & Reckless is his best effort, but his first and second were also in a class by themselves. You've got to here Wayne Hancock."
5,cool,"wayne hancock does it again, he really has a great sound, a great wangy style voice that hits all the notes, his band is also very talented"
2,ho hum,a rather lackluster effort from this NEO hillbilly singer! His past work was better this is tired and uninspired rehashed stuff! I'd rather listen to Hank Williams senior or Webb Pierce!
4,perfect tool for students and teachers,"the KKV (king, Keohane and Verba) is one the best tool for beginners in research for social, political, International Relations students or academics. it delivers advices and problems that researchers will come across at one moment of the research life. it also offers a good overview and critical analysis of what research is.the authors make sure the heavy subject that is reasearch in social sciences is not too heavy to read. the books approaches the different methodologies that research will have to chose.if not owned yet, it is in need to be buy and must belong the student private library."
3,As Advertised,These speakers fit perfectly in my 1986 Fiero GT. I pulled up an article for car stereo installers on how to determine which terminal on the speaker was the positive one (they're not marked) and proceded to do the install. The speakers don't sound quite as good as I hoped but they're every bit as good as the factory dual cone speakers. A lot better in fact considering those were shot!
1,"honestly, I cant tell you how they sound","Upon arrival, I was so excited to finally replace the blown speaker in the rear of my suburban with these bad boys.... only to open the package and find a defective set of speakers. the center speaker on both units were hanging by the wires fed from the larger speaker. how upsetting, and what a hassle this turned out to be."
4,they do its work,"even when the speakers are kenwood (to me is of the berst brands in audio) they doesn't have the quality sound that i expect, anyway, the place to install is not the best, the car manufacturer (chevrolet S10) don't botter in make a ""box"" with the body of the car, the speaker is half inch away from the body so is imposible to make that this little speakers sound in its complete range of sound for what they were designed."
3,To Sensitive,"This is a beautiful Steam Engine Train. Their is a lot of attention to detail, but I found this engine to be a problem on my lay out. The engine is very sensitive to any minor flaws such as a minor un-level track. I now have to remove my above track switchs, and install under-table switchs because the engine cannot pass by the above table switchs."
2,Bad service / Bad support,Washington DC and Arlington VA 3G service is spotty at best. Do yourself a favor and stay with Sprint or Verizon. Cingular will also not work in the metro.

5,very informative,"I have found it to be a good start for the beginner and the experienced. A lot of good advice, not overly wordy."
5,Home gardening made sensible,This DVD presents valuable information not only to the new gardener but also to the more experienced gardener looking to extend their knowledge base. Marjory presents an incredible amount of knowledge in an understandable way - and manages to take the pressure off by reassuring watchers that gardening has challenges but can still be fun.
5,Great CD,I enjoyed watching this CD and thought it was very informative. I have not seen any other cd's that covered all of the subjects in one cd.
5,Food Production Systems for Backyard or Small Farm,"It's comprehensive, but very easy to follow. I watched it three times to memorize some of the steps. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is serious about self-sustained living. Growing your own food is a reward unto itself."
5,ExCellEnt,"This video set is totally awesome! It reallycovers a tremendous amount - I watched it several times over, and will watch more again. Really useful info if you want to be food self-reliant."
5,Very Heilpful DVD!,An excellent DVD for a beginner and for one that thought they knew all they needed to know. Full of insights and ideas for food production and other food sources that I never knew.
5,Lots of great information here!!!,After seeing these DVD I was very inspired to do more than I thought I could with the land and area I have. Started with a small garden this year going to implemented a lot more next year! These really opened my eyes to what my family and I can do for our selves after seeing the videos! Have told my family and friends to get hold of these for future reference!!
5,Points you in the right direction,"When I decided to get serious about growing as much of our food as possible, I was a little overwhelmed. Marjorie's Food Production Systems DVD helped me formulate a plan, calculate what I would need, gave tips for everything from enriching my soil to butchering game. Not only that, it helped me determine what I needed to put on the list for future expansion and gave information on things I had not thought of doing like rainwater harvesting. There are lots of resources on the disc for researching things further as well. A very good investment!"
5,Marjory is a dedicated old school gardener extraordinaire,Backyard Food Production is renewing the state of common sense across the land. It is a very wise project to redevelop both self sustaining food production with the added encouragement of cottage industry for example like the cultures that continue from the old country where self sustaining culture provided both safety and reliability for the necessities of life.
5,in-depth and approachable,"This video is a fabulous introduction to a more sustainable lifestyle for the newbie, as well as a rich source of detailed information for those who have been living on the land for a while. Marjory gracefully and thoroughly addresses so many facets of providing for oneself and their family. Informative and enjoyable, highly recommended for everyone in Central Texas or anyone interested in becoming more self-reliant."
4,Good for beginner,"I found the DVD and information to very helpful for a beginner (me). The author has a long history of experimenting to find what does and does not work. I anticipate this will save me a lot of time when I get even more active in growing my own foods and would recommend it to any contemplating this kind of ""home work""."
2,Not what I hoped for,"I found this video to be not really that helpful. It's hosted by this lady whos just walks around her garden and shows us different stuff but doesn't get into any great detail on how to actually do things. This is set in Texas and so she talks about only things that would grow there, I wish I had known that before I bought the video. I was hoping for more detail on the types of plants and how she sets up the gardens. Some detail is shown on how she collects water, but not much. She shows how she raises the rabbits and how her set up is not really ideal. I feel sorry for those rabbits, she shows how she kills them and skins them, it was absolutely disgusting, but I couldn't take my eyes off of it, like a traffic accident! I know now that I sure would not be raising any rabbits! Overall low production value, didn't cost her a thing to make this video, she could have at least put on a bra and some makeup for it."
5,GREAT!,"Very interesting and informative. Personal and homey, almost like talking with a friend! I found many ideas and much helpful information that I am anxious to put into practice!"
5,Food Production Systems for a Backyard or Small Farm,"This is extremely thorough, concise and easy to understand. Plus there are numerous links to take your knowledge further. Have highly recommended to friends who also aim to be self sufficient, organic and sustainable."
5,self sustainability !,We must get back to depending on self more than large corporate businesses. We have become too dependent on others and unable to even feed ourselves.I wish this resource was around 20 years ago . Even if you do not have land you can grow small scale in pots or join a community garden OR support your local Farmer's market.
5,I can do it too!,"This video is packed with information that has helped me to realize that I can create a backyard food production system for myself. I am excited about implementing my own food production plan, developing the various skill sets that is required and reaping the bountiful benefits... Thanks Marjory!"
5,Very informative videos,I found these videos very informative. Marjorie covered everything with detail. It made me feel that I could achieve whatever level of self suffiency that I desire.
5,Great resource,This video is a great resource for people wanting to raise their own crops and small livestock. It offers practical and useful tips.
5,Great Information,When I got this DVD I did not know what to expect but I must admit I was pleasantly surprised by the depth and layout of this DVD. The information is so valuable for the price it is sinful what I paid for it!!!. Then to add more value they provide additional information and resources which most do not do. I even contacted the author for more information and they answered promptly! I recommend this DVD for anyone planning a homestead and do not know where to start or someone who needs ideas to get them going. If they do another DVD I will definitely purchase it!
4,"Nice product, only one complaint",This box is a lot sturdier and stronger than we expected. It is like a safe for your key! The only complaint is that the combination can be entered in any order and not in an exact order. You have to make sure you use less than ten digits and the minimum is five. It is really easy to set up and install and is definitely secure.
5,I have 2 of these,"This is a really rugged and durable safe for a few of your important keys. It doesn't hold a lot of keys, but it is strong enough for outside or in the garage."
2,Didn't like it,i had done quite a bit of research on these types of locks and nowhere did I see anything about the fact that the combination could be put in any order and it would still unlock even if it was put in in a different order than that at which it was set. It was also difficult to put the cap back on.
1,key safe trap,"This key safe is a 5 key safe. It is deceptively listed with a weather cover that is for a 2 key safe. The cover is too small to use with the key safe. As far as I can tell, there is no cover for this safe."
1,not secure,"I have a issue with a combination that can be entered in any sequence, basically a 4 digit code has 24 possible options to open it! It took me 5 min of playing around with it to open it not knowing the code, maybe I got lucky but the reality is I am not a seasoned criminal and clearly not comfortable leaving this type of box outside my home!"
2,Lock Box Key Safe,"We are not using this box. It is heavy and secure, but stands out farther from the wall than others. Setting the combination is not as friendly as others."
3,Not so sure anymore . . .,"When I purchased this key lockbox, I was impressed with the construction. But . . . I just had to break into mine, as I either forgot the combination or the mechanism failed. Admittedly, I most likely forgot the combo as I haven't had to open it in a year or so. Anyway, the point of the review is that it took no more than 30 seconds with a hammer and a flat head screw driver to pry it open. Though to be fair, I am not sure if the box is designed to withstand any more punishment than that. In other words, I think it is only effective in keeping out those who would not just break a window, kick-in a door or pry open the key lockbox."
4,Just what we needed!,"This is a sturdy lock box that easily mounts pretty much anywhere you need it. For us, it was the answer to our developmentally disabled daughter's continual loss of her key. This way, she doesn't take the key with her anywhere, but she can always get in the house. For some it might be a negative that when you set the code it can be pushed in any order (i.e. if the code is 1234 the lock will open with 2431, 4132, etc) but again, for our needs, our daughter just needed to learn the pattern.The only reason that I didn't give this a five is that once you remove the cover, you have to push to code again to put the cover back on. But hey, if my daughter can learn to do it, I probably shouldn't complain. :)"
5,Worked Great,This worked great for storing the key to my gun safe. I didnt like hiding the key in the same room as the safe but was worried about not having the key close by. This item solved my problem. I mounted it directly yo the safe and it works perfectly! Also mounted one to the top of my bug-out-box.
5,Solid Lockbox!,"This Key Safe is the genuine article! Very heavy, cast metal with gray finish. Bolts up sturdily to your building and provides a highly tamper resistant storage for keys. Combination can be changed as often as needed. Not a consumer-grade product, but rather a substantial commercial/industrial quality item. Highly recommended as secure. Probably would do best in an area sheilded from rain, but evidently not completely necessary due to heavy construction."
2,Boring-reads like a bad textbook.,"I am a corporate trainer who uses practices borrowed from the theatre to transform organizations. I bought this book hoping to gain insight into the decision making processes of CEO's. Instead, I found myself mired in a swamp of technical language and what looked to be quite outdated studies.I used to think of this kind of material as ""above my head,"" but not anymore. The authors pedantic writing style is so boring it's barely readable. CEO's are dynamic, engaging people, not bookish researchers. I think the minutia presented in this book would be an immediate turn-off to most corporate execs."
3,about ends lenght,"Nice quality product HOWEVER the lenghts are about wrong. The end going to radiator is perfectly longer to be cut at your need, but the end going to T-stat housing is really short to make a perfect fit, beside that, cut is not flat, and a little bit angled, what makes to fit even like was shorter than actually is."
1,"""If I can't win with white boys ...","... then I'll have to do it with niggruhs.""I was there. I heard him say it.Name 'em and shame 'em. The man was a disgrace."
2,poor and small selection of works,I was disappointed in the works displayed. None had the classic vivacity of his famous works; they seemed to be from some limited collection that was most easily available.
2,"Worthy, but not necessarily useful","I agree with the reviewer above - this is an interesting study on a worthy subject.However, I found the problems with the book overcame its usefulness. For a start, there is the tone and organisation, as mentioned above. Annoyingly, the book is also sprinkled with 'inspirational' quotes, such as ""The condition of the human spirit is so profound that it encourages us to build bridges"". This appears in the section on forgiveness. If I wanted platitudes, I could have just bought myself a Hallmark card.The tone of the book is definitely summed up by the title (""Can't Touch My Soul""). I think many survivors would find this book frustrating precisely because sexual assault did 'touch their soul'.I'm sure some people will find this book very useful, but if you're after a practical guide to healing from sexual abuse I would recommend ""The Courage to Heal"". It is inclusive of lesbian experience, and is completely platitude-free."
4,Excellent... don't let the Dummies fool you,"I have always used Walkenbach's Excel books so when I saw the Dummies guide, I had to give it a try. I am a novice at programming anything but consider myself to be a fairly advanced Excel user.This book certainly provided me with an easy start to Excel Programming. I read it within a week and at the end, I understood all the concepts introduced. The book would be perfect if it had some exercises set at the end of the chapters (with solutions on a CD or website somewhere).Now that I am attempting to utilize this at work, I find that I need a more in-depth book to help me with more intricate programming solutions and to work out the bugs in code that I have written. Notwithstanding, I credit this book with allowing me to understand Excel's full potential and to design spreadsheet solutions (even if I am not yet expert at executing my designs)."
2,"OK, but could be better","This book is good for individual concepts, but it does not connect the dots. After going through the entire book, I have to say that I don't feel that I could write a useful program. The examples given are too simple, and subsequent sections in the book do not show how to build on knowledge gained in the previous sections. Unless you are extremely smart, you won't by the end of this book, be able to write a program with the complexity of say, for example, something that gives the roots of a quadratic equation including complex roots, or be able to make the solver addin function do multiple calculations for you.In short, this book is a good reference if you need to know something specific, but it wont make you a programer, as it claims it will. Something that would definetely make it more helpful would be if the author could include some excercises and worked examples of progressively greater complexity."
4,Excel pilot for automation,"Unlike most Visual Basic instructions that just teach you to build a ""Hello World"" dialog box and not get any real work done, this book helps you to put automation into your spreadsheet which will help your users from making errors. I was interested in consolidating data from various user areas into a master across a network and this was an excellent reference for selecting those ranges and copying them back to update the master using a VBA procedure."
5,Great Book,"This was a truly great book that helped me with Excel VBA for a project at work.That being said, this book is purely for introductory purposes. Assuming you know how to work with Excel, this book will greatly help you get a start on VBA for Excel. This book doesn't cover the kind of topics you would find in the Power Programming in Excel VBA book, but it covers really basic topics for a beginner.If you're a beginner to Excel VBA, I would highly recommend this book as a starting point for learning to master it."
1,Rubbish,Some of the foumulars shown are filled with errors. Mine was on kindle. No explanation as to WHY thisgs are.
2,Not for Kindle,"Would not recommend this in Kindle form. The screen shots are unreadable unless text size is enlarged enough, but then the entire screen shot can't be seen on one Kindle screen."
4,Excel VBA for Dummies review,"Easy to read and understand. This book will get you up and running quickly, but stops there. As an advanced Excel user, I still feel like I don't know VBA for Excel. In order for me to progress I will need to actually start using it on a project that is meaningful. Just like everything else, I guess."
5,Try this book FIRST!,"Finally, a book on VBA that even I can understand. This one truly starts at the beginning unlike other books, and I tried a couple of them. Recommend this book first before you use the others, (unless you are not a true beginner).Note: This is mostly for Office 2000 thru 2003, there is another book for Office 2007."
4,Excellent book for dummies,"I enjoyed reading the book and learned several tricks. Right after that, I was able to take a big macro developed by some one else and enhanced the macro to meet current needs of the project."
4,Really good book,Especially helpful to those who are knowledgable of Excel and have a basic understanding of programming concepts.
1,Do not buy this battery,"The battery fit fine, but did not work. The quality is also poor. The little lights don't light up and the material just seems real cheap. Mine did not charge. You should pay a little more and get a reliable battery. I was out of town for a couple weeks for Christmas and they refuse to take a return. They were rude."
1,"Started great, lasted a month.","My battery lasted just long enough to out-live the warranty. I got about 45 days out of it before it stopped holding a charge, and now I can't return it. Don't buy from these guys."
1,Battery for Dell,"I wasnt sent the correct one. the one posted on the site wasnt compatible with my computer. on return, I never got my money back or a replacement, as promised. spent hours n hours calling the customer care and arranging pick up from my place. never got a replacement. have to use my computer totally on charger now, i wont recommend buying your laptop battery from this dealer. i m sorry its the only bad experience i have had on amazon."
1,Terrible experience,"I purchased this battery from NewMP3Technology, and it exploded 10 minutes after its first use. As other reviewers have also written, there is no invoice in the box; therefore, the only way to know how to return the item is to contact NewMP3Technology. However, they will not answer your emails (I have done it multiple times in the past 10 days: no luck). I am also very disappointed by Amazon for letting these sellers on their site: bottom line, I am left with an exploded battery, and no idea how to receive a refund."
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PRODUCT PROTECTED BIOS,"Complete waste of time and was very disappointed.If you are going to sell a product that isn't licensed, at least provide a software fix for the issue if it's available. Otherwise it wastes everyones time and money."
1,DID NOT WORK,Received this battery and it will not hold charge. Tried another good working battery with no issues. This was just a waste of money. Only good thing is that shipping was prompt.
1,Keep Looking,"Worked for about 2 months, now won't hold a charge. Even when it was charging properly, it would only last about 60-70 minutes."
1,"Worked for a while, then sucked","The battery worked very well for about one or two months, and then is was not able to hold a charge at all. It ended up being a waste of money."
1,Dell Inspiron replacement battery,"Battery had a 30 minute charge when I received it. Would not hold one charge. Another classic ""lemon"" product. Will never buy a product from this company again. Junk!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"All Library Science, NO Information Science","If your looking for information on how and where to obtain a job in a library, this is a good book. Other than that, the book fails to give you examples on how far a degree in Library and Information Science can take you in the business world. If your not really interested in being a librarian, my advise would be to pick up another book that gives you more options. Or, go back to school and get another type of degree. Your choice."
4,Shoulder rest for a child's violin,My little girl found the color desirable and the comfort achieved good. Unfortunately it didn't make the violin more desirable with this product.
4,What this holder is used for.,"This holder does have value despite what the other reviewers say. While it isn't the most usefull item on the planet for typical games it is great for Nintendogs.I bought my Girlfriend a Nintendo DS and Nintendogs. I thought It would be fun for her to have a neat little pet and I knew she would love the game. Well she did love it. In fact she loved it so much she turned the DS into her cubical pet. She set up the DS in her cubical and Nintendogs is like her little friend while she is at work. She was complaining though that it should stand up so she doesn't have to stop working and hold the DS to play with the Dog.Thats when I found this little stand up thingy. She says it,s great. Now her DS stands up and she can pet and interact with her Dog at work without having to pick up the console."
3,AC adapter,"Um, yeah. I don't have one of these, but if you need a replacement AC adapter because yours suddenly stopped working (due to manufacturer's defects), nintendo will give you one for free if you are still within 90 days of the purchase date. Call (800) 255-3700 for service. Otherwise, you can buy one from amazon for $12 or directly from nintendo for $15.I don't know why people rated this so low. It's obvious what it does. I think it would be nice if you don't want to hold your DS all the time (and there is a table near)."
4,Great if you can not hold with both hands,"I do not have this yet, but my husband had a stroke 18 years ago so only has the use of his right side. Any game that uses the touch pad he can not use, as he can hold with one hand but not do the other stuff. This (I hope) will make it so he can put the game in the dock, and use the touch screen with the one hand he can use.(so there are some that need this and are not lazy, etc.)"
3,Great item,Great item for the system. I bought this for my kids so they wouldnt have to hold the system in there hands all the time. It holds the ds fine but not as well as expected. It still has a lot of space in between the game and the dock so it can fall out if tipped over. Made more for the dsi or the dsi xl. But on the bright side it's a good item to hold on a table top if you dont want the kids running around the house with the system in their hands in fear of them dropping and damaging the system. It sits upright so they can still see the game and play while handsfree so its a great product to keep the game system and kids in one place lol but made more for a wider system.
1,Don't Buy This!!!,"This thing is definitly not a good idea!All it is is a stand for your DS. It doesn't do anything except help you play some games. The DS wasn't ment to be put on a stand on a table, it's supposed to be portabaly playable. Note: Table required for use."
5,Like the mix tape your best friend made for you.,"You know the type of mix tape I'm talking about.You've been listening to it again, and again, for years. Every song, every silence, every little undulation is ingrained in your memory.The Book of Life Soundtrack is such a work. I feel like a close friend of mine put together this collection of songs.Indeed, I'm listening to it at work right now.If you like P.J. Harvey, Yo la Tengo, and have an appreciation for beautiful vocal music, obtain this album as soon as you can. Trust me on this one."
2,Listed as New but is is used and very old!!!!,"The item listed this Santa as being new. The box was all dusty, the item was used and looks to be more than 10 years old and was not worth the money. This item was misrepresented totally by the owner and this person should be banned from selling on Amazon.com. Never have I purchased an item listed as new and received it and seen something in such bad shape. I am going to file a complaint with Amazon.com and with my credit card company as this person misrespresented and fraudulently sold me a piece of junk for $17.00 plus shipping.SANTA CLAUS PLAYING ACCORDION 13"" (battery operated)"
4,nice,just wish the magnet was a bit stronger to keep it on fridge better other then that great pot holder and for uner hot pots
1,The Last Prophet,"Review based one Amazon viewing, not reading: Why no excerpt (worthy of the name)? Why no advances from Table of Contents?I'm 61 -- I love(d) Cat Stevens. But, without having read anything but what he allows online, I can only conclude that he is as deluded as ""Muhammed Ali"", and has no more idea of what Islam is than I did two years ago. Caveat Emptor."
5,DELIGHTFUL STORY!,"Appealing to all ages, this is a delightful story!Meet ""believable"" characters learning an invaluablelesson in life while touching your heart - leaving youanxious to meet them again..."
4,"Excellent book, very convicting...","I am almost finished reading this book; I have to admit, I'll miss the insight and prayer and repentance that seemed to go along with every new chapter (and sometimes each turn of the page). This is the first book I have read from Marva and really learned so much. I have to admit that much of what she says is already along the lines of things I believe anyway, but she does a great job of communicating what living like a child of the Most Holy God may really look like. We are so blessed...there are so many hurting, desperate people in the world today. Do we dare to change our consumer habits to better love our neighbor? I hope I will."
1,Misleading,"I order a book that was listed ""Like New"" and I couldn't believe the amount of highlighting and column notes all over the pages. I was extremely disappointed."
2,Not so great,"All of the ""activities"" are touching the book which is boring. Much prefer ""Pat the Bunny"" which has more interesting things for baby to do."
4,Books for little ones,My daughter just turned one and she loves this book. It's well constructed--built to last little hands that tug & pull on everything!
3,CD player,"Used to DJ most of the time worked fine but, would hang up and thankfully I had a spare to use."
1,watered down,Athis product has been watered down. I complained and was told they would check on it but never heard back. Would never reorder.
1,Awful!,This is a piece of JUNK! It briefly offered a light breeze and then proceeded to break. It would start and stop and eventuallywould not start at all. Don't even think about ordering this product.
3,Ok fan for 20 bucks,"Yep its a fan. I rated it so-so because it is not quiet, and even on the lowest fan speed (1) it is spinning very fast. There is little difference in fan speeds 1,2,3 (3 is fastest). Poor quality motor but what do you expect from a 20 dollar piece of plastic!"
4,Powerful Fan,"I purchased this fan for my son's room. I purposely wanted something fairly inexpensive so that it could double as a fan and also create some white noise. This fan does the trick. We tend to only use the fan on level one because it puts out enough air, but level 2 & 3 really put out some wind, which is great for hot days. The fan is not super quiet, but for me that was not a requirement."
3,50% approval,"I bought two of these about 6 weeks ago. One works fine. I noticed recently that the other one is only working on high and off. Low and medium are not an option. When you push the buttons down, they pop right back up. I might be able to get it replaced if I call the manufacturer but that's a big hassle."
1,Quits working,"We purchased two of these fans. One of them quit working almost immediately. We returned it for a replacement, which also quit working within a couple of days. The second fan (of our original purchase) worked for just over 2 months, and now refuses to turn on. Don't waste your money!"
1,Worked great for one week...,Yes I was pleased with the fan until the six day.The item lasted six days before it stopped working. I wil save the boxes next time so I can return future items. Not worth the shipping cost to return. I'll trash it and go to walmark and pick-up another one. Don't buy this junk.
1,Not a good fan,"I expected the fan to work as the other reviewers noted, but the fan I got didn't. The fan would get stuck and not move, heating up the little engine. I say stick with the tower fans."
1,Fire Hazard - Do Not Buy,I purchased two of these fans and both smelled like the motors were burning. One kept getting stuck when it circulated to the left and would make a constant clicking sound and produce sparks. Both of them arrived with marks on the housing a sign they were either previously used (which I doubt given it's Amazon) or the manufacturing process is very sloppy. I would not recommend these to anyone unless you want a fire hazard. After one of them starting showing little sparks in the housing I decided to trash both of them.
1,Fan died after two months,"I bought this fan in June, 2010, when I purchased two other fans (each a different brand). The Optimus was the quietest of the three I purchased. It was not used every day. After a month, I noticed it was sluggish when we turned it on.Last week, I noticed oil around the base. Apparently all the oil in the motor has leaked out. The fan always sat on a level, horizontal surface. Today it won't turn on, at all. It is dead. I did not keep the shipping boxes due to storage space constraints. I recommend you avoid this product. We are very disappointed in this product."
1,It was broke when i opened package!,When i opened the box the head was broke off the stand so i can't really rate it. Had to get on Amazon website toprint out return label. No return label was in the box. Can't really tell if it was shipping that broke it or ifit was broke at the store. The box was bashed up pretty good.
1,Hard to put together and then not worth it.,The fan was expensive and then came not put together. I had to put the parts together and needed a screw driver which I didnt know that I needed. and the instructions were in spanish. I also paid extra for next day shipping and it came three days later. Very unhappy.
3,Something fishy about these ratings,"There is lots of hype about light therapy, and lots of books on it too. I wonder about these glowing reviews, though. They are all 5 stars, all by ""readers,"" and all say nothing! The major asset of this book seems to be its cover art. This shows you how you can publish a book, get five friends to review it, and voila, you have a well-reviewed book."
5,Great book,This is one of the best books on Nietzsche and Jung. It argues very effectively that Nietzsche was not a simple atheist but had his own religious quest. The book is very clearly written despite the difficulty of its subjects. The scholarship is luminous on every page. I've studied Nietzsche and Jung for over twenty years but found myself learning many new things. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in either Nietzsche and Jung. Despite the high price of the book it will be a splendid addition to your library.
1,"Very thin steel, cracked on handling","The first thing that struck me about this flask is that's it's very light and is made of thin steel-- noticeably thinner than the flask i currently own. This wouldn't necessarily be problem, except that the flask developed a two inch crack along the top seam five minutes after handling out of the box. Yes, i'm pretty sure it wasn't cracked when i took it out of the box, and i was just looking at it when i noticed the crack. I really hope other that have ordered this flask don't have this problem. Well, better to crack now then when filled with liquor in my friend's purse. Too bad we're leaving for vacation in three days, so i'll probably just pick up the one i saw at REI yesterday.Bummer."
3,"Great product, but misleading picture","I have used Toko brushes to wax my nordic skis for many years and could not be more satisfied with the quality of their products. However, when I ordered this brush the picture showed it as a full copper brush but I received a half nylon half copper brush. Toko brushes are great and when I get the opportunity to use this one I know I will not be disappointed, but I still would have appreciated a more accurate picture of what I was actually receiving."
4,Exellent guide for beginners.,"A good book for a reader that did not attend Oracle courses or lack an expertise in several fields, definitely not a study textbook, but a reference for already working DBA."
2,a lot of bugs! - not worthy,I reviewed this book and I found a looooot of bugs in there. Nobody bothered to check if all queries are ok.Examples?

1,Misleading title,"This is not a double hose male connector, this is a hose to pipe connector. The title in my opinion is misleading.The details of the add are correct."
1,A Real Letdown,"When I was first given this book as a gift, I was quite excited. I am a trivia buff and the questions being answered in the book were really fun subjects. As I read, however, I quickly became suspicious. Why didn't the author allow virtually any room for multiple explanations of the origins of phrases and customs? How could he possibly have done the research required to answer all these questions thoroughly? Why did he seem to answer almost all questions with such certainty, even those with a brief explanation?Doing some research of my own on a few questions (why is sidespin in pool called English, for example) and found that the author is often just passing on apocrophyl stories and urban legends. It seems as though mostly he researched perhaps one or two sources to answer each question.Since getting to the bottom of urban legends and myths are what caused me to get so interested in trivia in the first place, I found this book a real letdown."
3,One or two gems here and usually interesting,"Smith answers a lot of questions that we forget to ask, like why is horse meat considered inedible (it is associated with pagan sacrifice, he says). There are some gems like why do we shake hands -- yes, its a gesture that we do not bear arms, but did you know the shaking was to shake out any concealed knives up the sleeve?However, I dont know if he is very good on science. He says the sky is blue because the atmosphere scatters the blue light more than any other part of the spectrum, but then he says that sunsets are red because they scatter red light less than other colors. Not consistent, obviously."
2,"""Every wonder why"" by Douglas B. Smith","The book description sounded interesting, as did the small snippet I was able to read, however, once I received the book, I was very disappointed. I found at least 5 examples that I know FOR A FACT are incorrect. And that makes me wonder how many other of the examples are incorrect.It's a very short book and a very quick read, but not a very reliable source."
3,Not what I thought it would be,It's ok I thought it would be a lot different then what I seen online but it's ok reading I guess.
4,"Bravura Filmmaking, Great Performances","This is probably Ken Russell's best film after ""Women In Love."" It is truly unfortunate that only a pan-and-scan video is available; the brilliant opening ""Winter Carnival"" sequence, which introduces all the main characters - AND establishes their relationships, without a word of dialogue! - is particularly damaged by the cropped aspect ratio. Chamberlain was never better, and still in his physical prime, and Jackson is briliant as always. This is worth the price just for the drunken honeymoon train-ride scene. Why in God's name this isn't on DVD is beyond me- Chamberlain's fans alone would put this one in the black! Hellooo MGM, WB or whoever owns this title now, we're waiting for a widescreen transfer!"
1,CONTINUOUS EMASCULATION .....a slight correction please.,"Whoops!So sorry - I meant to call this movie a ""large, calorie filled English TRIFLE"" - there's obviously no such thing as an English Triple [unless it's ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday""].also""Glenda Jackson is one of the most gifted acresses of the 20th Century - no one has [not had] ever reached her zenith"" Apology to Ms. Jackson - she's still # 1.blame it on the tri-focals.Sorry again."
5,I expect dvd version release,"This is the most marvelous musical cinema I`ve ever seen. Of course,this is the Russell`s best.I expect DVD version release for a long time. Why doesn`t the studio determine to release? Let`s release it during he`s fine."
5,The very best book we've found for a new big brother!,"When I was pregnant with my second child, we went searching for the best book available to help our son get ready to be a big brother. It was quite an eye-opening afternoon in the bookstore stacks -- we couldn't believe how many of the books in this genre were almost wholly negative, portraying new siblinghood as something that the older child was really going to hate. That definitely was not what we were looking for.At last we found this little book, though, and it's perfect -- it covers some of the negatives of having a new sibling in the family, but its overall tone is positive and joyful, and at the same time matter-of-fact and realistic about what life with a new baby is like. Our son loves this book (we still read it now, even though his baby sister is 8 months old!), and other friends' children whom we've given it to love it, too."
4,A great book for toddlers/preschoolers,"I give this book (and its companion, ""I'm A Big Sister"") to every family I know who is about to have a new baby arrive. It has proven to be excellent in preparing a young child for the arrival of a sibling. I only have one gripe - the assumption of one manner of feeding. It would be much better written to have both options alluded to, as in, ""Babies need milk."" (which is in the text) with a picture of baby nursing along with a picture of Daddy or big sibling giving a bottle. Then each family could adapt it to their situation. I am glad, however, that the bottle-feeding illustration shows the Daddy giving the bottle, which does happen in some breast-feeding families. Would love a revision to include both situations, however! All in all, a WONDERFUL book!"
5,Very nice book,"Our 20 month old son calls this the ""Brother Book"" and goes and gets it off the shelf for us to read it to him. As most of the reviews already say, this is a sweet book with a friendly approach to the impending life change. We have made all of the characters into ourselves, calling the boy in the book by our son's name. I also show him pictures of myself pregnant with him and then what he looked like after he was born and I think that between the book and the photos our son is beginning to understand that there is a new baby on the way. Certainly that something is going on in my tummy.I was surprised by how big this book is (about 15"" tall). I expected something smaller. Also, we never actually get to the end of the book as we get hung up on the ice cream at the park and get sidetracked to the freezer for ice."
4,big brother book,"We bought this book for our second son when he was almost two and we were expecting our third child. He still enjoys reading this book although our new ""baby"" is over one year old.In the back there is a little bit of practical advice for the parents to use to help their little boys transition from being the ""baby"" to being the big brother."
2,Not for me,"My 2 year old likes the pictures, but the writing is not that great or original. There are tips for parents at the end that was nice to read."
4,A good book.,"This is one of several books I bought for my almost-two-year-old. It's one of his favorites. The book deals with the addition of a baby very matter-of-factly, but positively. Both Mommy & Daddy take care of the baby. Daddy even changes a diaper. It gives a very positive account of the new baby in respect to the big brother, too. The advantages of being a big boy and big brother are highlighted. I've given this book as a gift for friends having their second child."
5,My 2-yr old asks for this book all the time!!,"We received this book as a gift to my 22-month old son when his baby brother was born. I thought it was so cute and he loves it. That was 8 months ago and I can't remember how often I read it to him back then, but he asks for it to be read to him almost every day now! Whenever I read the book to him, I have always substituted his name for the ""I"" in the book just to make it less confusing for him (so it doesn't sound like I (mommy) am the big brother). He can relate to the pictures in the book because they look just like things we all have at home - the infant car seat, swing, baby bed with mobile, and even the toys they play on at the park. It is kind of hard to tell which one is the Mom in the book, though! I'm ordering the book for a friend whose 2 1/2 yr. old will be a big brother soon, too. I highly recommend it!"
4,Excellent Book for a two-year old,"My son absolutely loves this book. The pictures are drawn well and have lots of items that toddlers can identify: ice cream cone, apple, stroller, bottle. I think that it will help smooth the transition to big brother/sister for a child. The one thing that I wish is that it addressed nursing the baby. It addresses feeding the baby and how the big brother can help hold the bottle. This may not be a mainstream need, but I would have liked if the option of nursing was explored also: big brother can sit next to mommy and read a story while mommy nursed the baby. Great book overall."
5,Sweet Book for Preparing Tots for Baby Siblings!,"I bought this book for my nephew, who's getting a baby brother this spring. I liked the gentle tone of the book, the fact that it shows Dad doing parenting chores, the fact that it doesn't establish the gender of the new baby, allowing you as the reader to use that as a discussion point (or not), etc. The book would best be used as a jumping-off point for talks about what a new baby in the house means: i.e., ""this page shows the baby sleeping in a crib. You slept in a crib when you were a baby. Now you have a big-boy bed, right?"" or however you want to handle it. Each page could be used like that, if you wanted to, a few weeks apart, to give the child more time for processing and asking questions. (Caveat: If you're in a single-parent, two-mommy, or two-daddy household, you might get questions about who the second parent is in the picture.)"
5,2.5 year old loves this book!,"My son loves this book, and it's illustrations. Both of us love Falwell's We have a baby, but this is a good companion to that for any expectant or newly additioned family. I like that this is ""big brother"" specific, as that is a special title to the only boy in our family who is quite used to being the baby, lol. A good buy."
5,Great Book for a Young Big Brother,"This big brother is only 2 1/2 years old. It's a great way for a toddler to realize how important he is to his little brother or sister. It's a nice opposite of the jealously that the big brother will experience. And, it's nice that the big brother gets a gift, when the new baby is getting a gift."
4,A good book for a big brother to be,"I bought this book at the suggestion of a friend. So far, my just-turned-2-year-old son seems to like it. He even selects it himself upon occasion. His brother isn't due for three more months, though, so the helpfulness of this book remains to be seen! :)"
5,Great book!,"My son is 25 months old and is expecting a new brother or sister next month. I'm not sure if he really understands it all yet, but this book has been fun to read and he knows the concept of big brother now. Good find - def. recommend it for anyone with a toddler expecting another child."
4,My son loves this book,A friend bought this book when my daughter was born. We read it with my son a lot in those early days. My son still likes to read it almost 4 years later.It is a great book with wonderful pictures. I am buying it now for a friend with a 2nd child.
5,Very reassuring book for a new big brother to be.,I bought this for my grandson who has some worries about his lifeonce his sibling arrives. This is a lovely way to reassure him that hewill always be a very special person in his family.
5,superb accuracy and stopping power,I fire them out of my Benjamin 392. These pellets are extremely accurate and deadly for small game. Took care of my squirrel problem.
1,grunge / heavy rock,"GOBBLEHOOF was the band from new aLLIANCE lABEL WHICH GAVE US sLOVENLY AND Solomon Grundy along with PURPLE OUTSIDE( Early Screaming Trees). This album is a masterpiece with ChARLES najikama - The Giant of a Man in full Throttle. His Sound will make you sit up and Take notice. JR MASCIS Drummed on this AlbumSimilarities to heavy early grunge cannot be ruled out, though Charles sings like he is in a Death Metal Band.Interesting .... for a change"
1,A coloring book,"I think the editorial reviews is a bit misleading, in fact it is only a coloring book for children."
4,Inspiring,This book was very good. it makes you undertand him more. He was really a good perdon. This book is good to have for rememberance
1,You've got to be kidding me!,"This is just more proof that music labels are completely out of touch with the world around them. None of these songs should ever be played at a football/soccer match - let alone on a compliation for the World Cup.It's bad from the start and keeps getting worse. It's clearly obvious that Sony is just trying to cash in and with their horrible PR misteps lately (not to mention the train wreck that is the PS3) it's clear Sony's time is almost up.Avoid this album (and Sony, if you can) like the plague."
2,A BIG UH-OH!,"Okay teh only reason I'm giving this album two stars is because some of the artists on there are realy good.There are two main problems in the album:1. Most of the songs have nothing to do with the World Cup. I mean seriously.2. The songs are quite outdated.I enjoy listening to Mariah, Kelly, Shakira, Elvis, Celine, Whitney and all but their songs had no purpose on this particular album. They should asked to write and perform new songs, it would make more sense. Even Kelly's new Ford song, ""Go"" would've been better. I'm disappointed in this compilation. I have to say though I delibrately held a grudge against Il Divo because well, I hate SIMON! haha. But I have to admit, these guys can SING. They are really good at what they do and I respect them for that. Toni and Il Divo deserve a pat on the back for their song.As for the people who compiled this album, learn something from the Commonwealth Games' album, might I suggest ""Together We Are One"" by Delta Goodrem."
2,"wrong cd, no harm, no foul","i received the wrong cd, it was in a foreign language and was not what i ordered, however they sent me a returm mailer and i was refunded my money, just wish they hadn't done that to begin with"
5,Dover reprint of Theory of Satellite Geodesy by W.M. Kaula,"I studied with Bill Kaula from 1964-66 at UCLA and used this text extensively at that time and later while doing research and teaching in satellite geodesy. This thin book presents the derivations and details of analytic methods for calculating satellite orbits, and determining Earth's gravitational field from observations of satellites. Numerical methods are now much more accurate, but ""number crunching"" does not provide nearly the insights that analytic analyses can. If you want insight into satellite orbit mechanics, this is the book to read. The first edition contained many typos and other errors which have been corrected in the Dover edition. The book provides an outstanding entry into the field of satellite geodesy. Math and physics at the upper division college level are required.Bruce C. Douglas"
4,Quick read book with solid basic knowledge,"This book answers the basic questions regarding satellites geodesy and is a good refresh for the subject. Also, the book is a quick read."
5,Great little bag for belt or bag,"This little bag securely holds accessories for easy access, very sturdily constructed. Useful on a belt or attached as additional storage to a camera bag. Part of Tamrac's system. Very recommended."
1,Beyond the Fall of NIght,"Both Against the Fall of Night and The City and the Stars are wonderful stories, beautifully writtenGregory Benford's ""sequel"" is incoherent mishmash. I kept jumping paragraphs hoping the story would get clearer. It didn't.Forget this book entirely and get the original Arthur C Clarke story (Against the Fall of Night) combined with The Lion of Comarre.I've never read a Gregory Benford story before and this turned me off so much I don't plan to read another."
1,Not again!,"Is there no end to these non-authors who can't create on their own, finding it necessary to climb on the backs of legit authors to get published? The relationship between Clarke's original and this mess of unconnected pages is like the relationship between a tornado and a child blowing out birthday cake candles, there simply is none.Norton, Heinlein, Clarke, Asimov, who's next to be lampooned?"
2,Read the first part; skip the second part.,"I've just finished reading this. I really enjoyed Clarke's ""Against the fall of night"". It was an excellent idea and an interesting story. I was looking forward to Benford's sequel to see how the ideas would be developed, and was completely disappointed. The sequel was boring and incoherent. I found myself skipping pages hoping that it would get better-it didn't. I managed to finish it, but only just. Finally, the end was just too cute to be believable. I've never read anything by Benford before, and so I don't know if this is typical of his work. So, read Clarke's part (4 stars) and forget Benford's (0 stars). Hence, the combined work gets an average of 2 stars."
2,Classic story and horrible sequel,"The first half of this book is Clarke's absolutely wonderful ""Against the Fall of Night"" which easily deserves a ""10"" rating. The second half, a sequel written by Benford deserving a ""1"" rating, is completely devoid of a plot or characterizations, barely has anything to do with the earlier work, is really not very interesting and ruins the beauty of Clarke's half."
2,Benford's work is not a sequel; it's a rebuttal.,"I'm reminded of the story of a well-known SF writer who as an experiment tried revising E.E. ""Doc"" Smith's galactic epics to remove the obsolete and clunky bits only to find he'd removed all the fun along with them. It's only by virtue of not tampering with the original text that Benford avoids commiting the same fault but with premeditation. Of course ""Against The Fall Of Night"" is obsolete SF. That doesn't matter. What matters is its atmosphere, and it is this atmosphere that Benford rejects systematically and irreverently. Clarke might not have objected to the changes, but authors view their works very differently than the readers do."
1,Worse sequel ever,"I loved Against The Fall Of Night since the first time I picked it up in a second hand book store. If I have nothing else to read, I can still pick it up and open to any random page and enjoy myself. So when Beyond The Fall Of Night came out, I was so excited. Major let down. How Clarke could have approved this is beyond me, no pun intended. Against was charming, putting you in the mind of a little boy who grows up as the only child to be born in seven thousand years. This book introduces you to strange characters who you have no interest in. I stuck with it, in the hopes that the Mad Mind would win and do away with these awful characters. At least they didn't carry this waste of paper into a third book."
3,not remastered,I bought this album because it's a recent release and I took it for granted that it would be remastered. When I took it home and listened to it the frequencies and dynamics of the music are just as dull as what A&M did with Spooky Two. There is nothing stated on the cd indicating any remastering and it's more of just a transfering. There's a recent version of the album on import which boast of being remastered with Cotton Growing Man being replaced by the Weight. You might want to check that out.
5,A very satisfied customer,"I did my homework for a couple of months or more before deciding on theCanon SD800, to find a digital camera with all the features I wanted.I then started looking in all the stores in my area and found no one had it in stock, nor did they know when or even if they would have it at all.I was leery of ordering it on the internet, but finally ""bit the bullet"" and checked out my options there and who had the best price.I am very satisfied with the experience dealing with Amazon. I had a certain amount of money and was not going over that. With what I saved infree shipping and no local tax, I was able to also purchase a 1GB card anda 2 year protection plan.It was a very pleasant experience dealing with Amazon and I would highlyrecommend them to anyone. I might add my camera came in 2 days.I have had a Canon SLR for 25 years and expect the same quality with thisdigital.I love my camera and am learning more about it every time I use it."
5,Canon SD800IS pocket camera,Very pleased with my Canon SD800IS. The IS steady cam feature is particularly useful with my unsteady hands. Clear pictures to the edge and easy to operate. Most happy fella!
5,Great Canon SD800,I am very pleased with the Canon SD800. It has a great feel and is easy to carry on my hikes. The picture quality of the mountain scenes is very good. Battery life also seems great.
5,Fabulous all around camera,"Compact, great pictures, image stabilization, little shutter lag, and canon quality. Plus something very few cameras of this size offer: 28mm wide angle which allows fitting so much more into the picture.I wish canon would incorporate a battery meter (only a warning when very near dead battery). Also can't force flash off unless in Manual mode. Need to switch dial to review pics, but it's fast.I still love it though, two of my other family members own one."
3,SD800 - 1 year after use,"The good:1.) Wide Angle2.) Fast3.) Compact4.) Custom color features5.) Great movie mode6.) Great daytime photos7.) Image stabilization featureThe bad:1.) Distortion with wide angle shots2.) Poor flash. My unit seems to have ""halos"" and particulates in every indoor flash shot."
5,It does just about everthing my $2700 Canon 5D SLR does!,"I bought this camera for my wife so she could easily take many of the typical family pictures that I traditionally have taken with my sophisticated and expensive Canon 5D and the like! I took pride in using all of the fancy things my ""sophisticated"" cameras could do along with their expensive lenses. Well, much to my surprise this little bugger can do just about everything I can do with my Canon 5D! OK, it won't do exactly what $2,000 to $5,000 worth of lenses does with the 5D, but it does a heck of a job for less than $400 in a package that fits in the palm of your hand!"
5,CANON SD800 IS,"Very good camera. This is my fifth digital camera, and by far the best. 7.1 meg, wide angle, image stabilization Li-ion battery.Its compact size allows it to go everywhere, and its technical performance is superb.I bought it for its wide angle capability. There is a little barrel at the widest settings, but that's OK. I can capture the image with the 7.1 megs, and work on it later.The life of the NB-5L battery pack is quite long, and the 120 VAC-240 VAC charger made it very convenient on my recent European trip.The SD card is a very inexpensive memory, and I already invested in two 2 GB cards.5 stars."
3,Lots of technology - poor pictures,"I have the SD700 IS and decided to ""upgrade"" to the SD800 IS. While the new processor seems to help focus speed a little bit, the pictures (especially) indoors are worse than the 700 and are very grainy. I wish Canon would focus picture quality instead of technology features. We seem to be going on a downhill slide in that area."
4,Uneven performance,"This is an easy camera to use; the controls are workable for large hands. In optimal lighting conditions it takes about 50% of the pictures in usable focus; the exposure is spot on nearly 100% of the time. But, compared with a lesser mp PowerShot, I have far more pictures that I discard. I find little evidence of the image stabilization effect. There is very little shutter lag which is a plus. The optional case is of little use as there is no room for an extra battery or flash card....and you NEED the extra battery. Today the camera simply stopped with no warning other than ""replace the battery."" There is no read out to tell how much battery power you have. They tell you to charge it before using it, but that's not practical. The movie feature with this is superb with excellent color balance. I love the compact size and probably am expecting too much as I have been using digital SLR's for several years."
5,Outstanding!!,This camera performed as expected and is my second canon camera. The quality is outstanding!!
2,"Good Camera features, bad design, bad service","I bought this camera for my wife in July 2007. It performed well (although the magnetic closure on the case demagnetized her credit cards) providing good quality photos and had good features. In December 2007, while on an outdoor walk, the camera died, giving a message 'lens error'. Still under warranty, we returned it to canon for repair. The camera had never been abused, unless you consider using it outdoors in the cold abuse. Canon returned the camera to us unrepaired, and stated that it had sustained liquid damage and was not economical to repair. I assume that the liquid was condensation that came from using the camera in the cold- but these are normal conditions that the design should have anticipated. Stay away from canon products as they stay away from their warranty responsibility!"
5,Canon PowerShot SD800 Digital Camera,Love this camera! I bought it for the image stabilization and it really works. It is small and light and very user friendly. The battery is different for me (and expensive to replace) but so far it hold the charge for a very long time. Price was very reasonable.
4,Almost Perfect Pocket Camera,"The SD800 is a take it with you all the time and everywhere kind of camera. It starts up very quickly, slips into your pocket with only a small bulge and if you care about pictures more than counting pixels, it produces great pictures. It's hard finding a small camera with a 28mm lens like the SD800. I had a Sony before the SD800 and Sony's battery life was pathetic compared to the Canon. I do wish there was a way to customize the settings, so I could turn off the flash and have it stay off until it is re-set.I really wanted shutter and aperture priority control but I knew when I bought the SD800 that it did not offer those options. It was a compromise I had to accept, since the rest of the camera is so great. If it had those options it would be the perfect pocket camera."
5,My daughter loves this camera,I bought this camera for my daughter for her birthday. She's used it about a month and has raved about it. She loves it's size and it's features.
5,Nothing bad to say,"My wife and I read a bunch of reviews on this camera before we purchsed it. Some people were saying bad things that we didn't even understand. Those people must be professional photographers because this camera is great if you are just a regular joe who wants a camera to take regular high quality pictures with. The image stablizer is amazing; not that we've had to use it yet, but it is nice to have. I can't say anything bad about this camera, good purchase so far."
5,Great Camera,"I did a lot of research before purchasing this camera and I'm really glad I did. I wanted a camera that not only took fabulous pictures, but would last us for a very long time. So far, I am very pleased with the quality of pictures and the features the camera has!"
5,Perfect Camera,I like this camera for great oportunity in it.Canon PowerShot SD800 is easy to use and makes nice pictures.I don't have any claims to it.
4,Good camera but pinkish color on videos in sun,"This is a great camera. However, I returned it after a week because when I take videos of my twins out in the sunlight there is a pinkish line that moves around when I move with the kids. I changed the setting to daylight but it still happens. Canon said you will get this with all camera with sun glare. My old Canon A85 did not do this hardly at all compared to this. Also the sound on the videos on the SD800IS is not as loud as my A85. The pictures download quick and take quicker with flash than my old camera."
2,Defective camera in low light,"This camera is packed with features, I love the image stabilization and the wide angle. However, in low light conditions with flash, camera produces white spots. I tested it out on 2 SD800s, both on a tripod, with flash in lowlight, and both were producing white spots in random locations. I ended up returning them and make sure you get the re-stocking fee waived.I set up the SD400 for the same test and it was fine.I would consider waiting till this issue is resolved."
4,a very good choice,"Canon PowerShot SD800 IS 7.1MP Digital Elph Camera with 3.8x Wide Angle Image-Stabilized Optical Zoom was indeed a very good choice at all levels: shutter speed, picture quality, manipulation and use of its different options..."
3,Average Rating,"I bought this camera because of the size and wide angle lens. The first time I used this camera, I noticed many round glare spots all over my pictures. I have never experienced this with my previous digital cameras. This doesn't happened all the time. I also noticed clicking sound inside the camera."
5,Really great camera!,This camera does everything I hopped it would. I just took it on vacation and couldn't have been happier. The battery lasted quite a long time. The photos look amazing!
1,Doesn't work with Windows 2000,"The camera takes great photos, and I can easily download to a Mac. However, ZoomBrowser Ex 5.7 will not install on Windows 2000. It's supposed to, but it generates a useless error message and bails. I have several older Canon cameras, but the older version of ZoomBrowser Ex (5.6) refuse to acknowledge the PowerShot SD800. I'll be returning my camera - it's obviously useless if I can't get the photos off of it."
1,Canon quality has gone down hill,"I purchased this camera based on other reviews and my previous experience with Canon cameras. I had this camera for one month and only took less than a dozen pictures. The lens suddenly would not retract. The error message says ""lens error"". This seems to be a common complaint, on the internet, regarding this camera. Perhaps that is the reason Canon quit making this model.I contacted Canon and they told me to send the brand new camera into them for repair, insured and at my expense.I took very good care of this camera and kept it in a hard case. It was never dropped, banged or mistreated in any way, yet it still failed.Canon customer service seemed very indifferent when I contacted them and they did not seem at all surprised that I had a problem with this camera.I am very dissappointed in both the camera and in Canon customer service.I guess, in this case, it really is ""Buyer Beware""."
1,"lens error, canon won't repair camera under warranty","We really enjoyed this camera until it stopped working during our vacation. It was a brand new camera, only 2 weeks old. We sent the camera to Canon for repairs and they REFUSED to repair the famous e18error because it's ""beyond economical repairs"". We took good care of this camera and it's beyond disappointment that we threw $300 down the drain.Will NEVER buy another Canon again.There's something to be said when there's an entire website for the e18 error and several class action lawsuits were considered by frustrated buyers."
4,I love it.,"I am very pleased with my new camera. It is easy to use, but has considerable flexibility in allowing me to adjust my picture-taking to the circumstances I find myself in. It is simple to connect to my computer for downloading images, and, for me, most importantly, it provides some stability to compensate for my shaky hands."
4,a great product,"the camera is a great one and as always one cant go wrong with a canon camera purchase. it was an upgrade to the sd 700 i purchased earlier. cant tell the difference really but it has more megapixels clarity. it doesnt tell you in advance how much battery power is left as all the earlier canon cameras, other than that a great product."
4,Small but packed with features,This camera packs alot in a small package. If you want a great point and shoot digital camera and not carry around another bag this is it. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles as the higher end digital SLR cameras but it has everything the casual photographer would want or need. My only concern is the door for the AV output is flimsy. I hope it doesn't break off.
2,Image blur,"got this SD800IS model when first released, amid the reputation and professional sales help from a major camera retailer, I agree good design and features but must report the ""Image Stabilization"" feature is hype ... especially at zoom focal, it doesn't suffice my personal expectation for price ... can't say anything other is ""wrong"" with this model yet now find myself shopping for a new camera, and (this is how it works)- it will NOT be a mid-range Canon ..."
4,So far So good,I have had a couple of Canon sd cameras before this one and for the most part they are good cameras. I find them simple to use and very easy to carry. I had the sd200 for a long time and it was a great camera and I was very pleased with it. I just got the sd800 and I love it so far. It takes great pics and the lcd screen is clear and big. The video works great as well.
5,Great Camera,"Great Camera. My first real digital camera. Can't believe how such a small camera takes such great pictures. WOW!!! Would recommend to anyone tired of dragging around an old 35mm camera and all of those lenses.Think shipment got caught in the Christmas volume or it would probably have arrived faster. Camera, battery charger, spare battery camera case and camera instruction manual all fit in a fanny pack."
5,Amazing!,I just got my new camera and I love it! It's very simple to use and the battery lasts for days. The picture quality is amazing and the time between taking one picture and being ready for the next is extremely fast. I'd suggest this camera to anyone looking for a new one.
4,Canon SD 800IS,Been using it for 1 week. Only weekness is telephoto could be a little stronger. Very happy with the images & video clarity.Excellent camera for this type of camera.
1,Don't buy a Canon!,"I got the fatal ""Lens Error"" after 10 months. This was a great camera, but I think a camera should last a little longer. This is a HUGE problem with Canon Powershots, and I really wish I had known about it BEFORE I bought this camera last Christmas. My camera is still under warranty, but they say that it is due to abuse and won't cover it. It was not abused, it just stopped working."
3,Great except for the white circles,"This camera normally takes great photos, but sometimes when using the flash there are small white circles all over the picture. This is supposedly due to dust particles in the air, but I never had this problem with my previous Kodak or Fuji cameras."
1,low light performance is not good,"in low light situation, the picture is grainy, dark, and soft. Nothing like SD700 or SD850 that I had/have. I returned my SD800."
5,very good on all counts,"We've used this for a couple of weeks, and we love it. No real specific comments to make, other than it's easy enough to use, has abundant functions, and seems to hold a battery charge well (which was important to us)."
4,good camera,"It's a nice little camera. just a little hard to remember all the controls, compared to some,"
4,Good Choice.,"Canon PowerShot SD800 IS 7.1MP Digital Elph Camera with 3.8x Wide Angle Image-Stabilized Optical ZoomThe SD800 IS a nice size with many handy extras. The menus are easy to follow and helpful. Picture quality is excellent. The only thing I dislike is the Shooting Mode Dial as it is difficult to control.C. Rendahl, California"
5,Fabulous,"I went to a local electronics retailer with a good return policy and bought the best camera form all the major brands. The Canon had the best picture quality by a long shot in this class. Also, the time from turning on the camera to taking a picture was one of the fastest which has allowed me to catch pictures of my son that other cameras would have missed."
4,Fuzzy on the action shots,"This was my second Cannon camera the first being a Sure-Shot 95. I had bought the SD800 as a lightweight substitute to take with me when I go backpacking. The camera was easy to use, fairly intutitive controls and good quality pictures.I tried using it to take stop action tennis pictures and it did not do as well as the Cannon 95 with several blurry shots amongst those that were okay. Based on a recomendation from the Amazon reviews, I put it in the ""Kid/ Pets"" mode with minimal if any improvement in the fuzzy focus. That would be my only quibble with an otherwise easy to use lightweight camera that takes good pictures."
5,Cannon SD800,"You'll never miss a shot! Comes up fast! Outstanding image stabilization, pictures turn out great. Shoots well in low light. Also has a wider angle than many cameras offer. It's easy to hold and has several image style settings to make it easy for even beginning photographers."
3,not too bad,"I have had this camera for a week - been testing and although it is quite a sturdy build etc... and has lots of plus, my problem is with the too much colour exposure on skin tones. I'm finding skin tones are coming out too red/green and the only way to adjust this is to take each individual picture in the manual mode or adjust them one by one."
4,Great Point and Shoot camera,"After researching several brands and models, the SD800IS was the best pick for my needs. Key selling points for me were the wide angle zoom, face detection and a real viewfinder that works with the zoom. Also, the software that comes with the camera is adequate for basic print, web and movie mode photo editing. Only thing I wish it had was a battery meter; an icon appears when the battery is getting low and it doesn't tell you how much time you have before it quits. But overall, a great camera!"
5,Great deal for the money,"Great picture quality, battery lasts for ever, simple downloading pics. If you are an expert with cameras---this camera takes incredible professional quality pics. Unfortunately, I am not a professional, I take great pics with optimum conditions. A friend who is a professional photographer takes amazing pics in all light conditions. He carries this camera 24/7 next to his cell phone--it is that good."
5,Meets all my photo needs!,"I purchased this camera about two years ago and have used it nearly every day since! I have 6 kids and I take a LOT of photos. This thing is great! The photo quality is excellent. It's light, compact and easy to use. I also have a Canon Rebel XT. While I love them both, I definitely use my little guy (the SD800IS) much more. I also use it frequently to record my family. It's so simple to get the recorded media off the camera and onto youtube! It gives a really decent recording, no complaints at all.I highly reccomend this camera for anyone, especially busy moms and dads who want quality photos."
2,Not sharp and crisp - poor image quality,"I have been into photography for over forty years, starting with Pentax single lense reflex cameras. Image quality is the bottom line in photography. If you don't have crisp sharp detail all the megapixels in the world won't help. I have an Olympus C-750 Ultra Zoom, but I wanted a pocket camera for those times when I didn't want to lug around the Olympus. So I bought the Canon SD800. Physically it is a beautiful piece of work, with very intuitive software, a pleasure to operate. But aside from close-ups, the pics aren't crisp and sharp. I've returned the camera to Canon twice for repairs. The first time they made adjustments. The second time they returned it saying everything worked per specs. I would not buy this camera, if I had to do it all over again."
2,Maybe my camera is defective?,"Based on reading these reviews, I went ahead and purchased this camera. I am finding however, that I actually prefer my Kodak camera. It seems that as I look at the screen while taking a shot, the screen seems low quality. Once the shot is taken however, it looks fine. But my main concern is the picture quality I am receiving!! While on my camera (through the LCD) the picture looks good. However, when I try to print, (either at home or at the lab) the pictures all seem to have a ""cast"" over them. Almost like a grey coloring, and VERY digital looking! Also, any picture taken with red in it prints out horrible! Everything takes on a red hue! It very well could be me, or maybe my camera is defective, but I never had any problems with my Kodak. I just wanted to upgrade after having my baby. I am really considering returning this camera."
5,Great camera!,I did lots of research on cameras before making this purchase and I couldn't be happier with my selection. Takes outstanding pictures in nearly all situations and the wide angle and Image Stabilization are a huge plus!
1,"Lens Problem, Worthless Warrentee","This camera was fine while it lasted. Unfortunately, it only lasted one month. Then one day the lens failed to retract. After that, all it would do is say lens error and turn off. I looked online for solutions and found that this was a very common problem with this camera.I sent it in to Canon to be fixed, but they sent it back saying there was water damage so the warrentee is void. It had never been exposed to any kind of moisture in it's short life, so basically the warrentee is good unless they decide to make up an excuse.No more Canon's for me."
2,Blurry images.,The product is engineered solidly. Nice design. Feels good in the hand. Relatively easy to operate. Good exposure programs.One major flaw though: the 28 mm wide lens system leads to unsharp images. The general impression is that the images are just not crisp.I own an older Casio EX-850 (8MP) and the differences are just stounding.I would definitely NOT recommend this product.The 35 mm equivalent models in the series are much better wrt sharp image results.
4,Great AND beautiful camera!,"When looking for a camera recently, I am a little embarassed to say I spent well in excess of 120 hours reviewing the different cameras out there. I narrowed it down to this one and the Fuji s6000. This one won because of it's size. I have not been disappointed! It takes beautiful pictures and is easy to carry in my purse. It does have some red eye, but I try not to use the flash too much. It comes on and is ready to use super fast, which is a plus. The battery life is great too. I took it for a weekend to Disneyworld and it lasted all weekend, but then needed to be recharged.The design and color are beautiful also. The video quality is great; another plus.I don't think you'll be sorry you bought this camera!"
4,easy to learn,"The camera is easy to learn and use. I took it out right away on a vacation to the United Kingdom. I was adjusting it all along as I took pictures and most came out great. I still had some trouble with blur which I was surprised at because I chose the IS (image stabilization) feature that is there with this camera. But, I was still learning and this may improve with use."
5,Camera for people who just want to take pictures,"We have just recieved this camera and we wish we had it sooner. The This camera will do as much as you want it to. It is compact, very easy to use, and the pictures are beautiful. That is just using it in point and shoot style. It has alot of functions we have not even used yet."
5,Canon PowerShot,"very happy with camera, which fits nicely in a purse so is always available; image stabilization worth the extra money"
5,great point and shoot camera,"i did a lot of research before i bought my next digital camera. having the canon sd100 powershot before, i was very happy with the powershot series, as opposed to my relatives who had the sony cybershot cameras. despite this, i looked at everything and found that the canon sd800 is a point and shoot camera that is built well.the wide angle lens is the most useful function, as i will often be the only person who can fit the entire crowd in the shot. the 3x optical zoom allows you to shrink down that wide area, so its not too annoying if you like taking closeups.photo quality is pretty good, the DIGIC chip does a good job of working out the colors. the face recognition AIS works very well. battery life is long. overall a very good camera."
5,Simply Awesome,"I just upgraded from the Canon s400. Amazing camera and has been very good to me over the years. I wanted some new technology, Digic III and the IS system. This camera so far is perfect. I do not have the 'crappy' door issues that some other users have as I am used to it with Canon products. The door on my s400 was the same and NEVER broke as a result. This camera is small and light, just about perfect.If you are upgrading you will be amazed how quick this camera is. Starts up fast, takes pictures quickly, just excellent. The 207k res. LCD is excellent as well. From my other Canon to this, the screen is light years better.Need an upgrade? Buy this 800IS.Need a new camera? Buy this 800IS."
4,love this camera,"i used to have a sony, and this is 10x better than the cybershot! my favorite thing about this camera have to be its ability to take pictures indoors at dimly lit resturants. i am a total foodie and like to take pictures of all the fancy food (making my $ last longer than just one bite!). it white balances very nicely - so when the plate is white and large and the food on it is small, the picture still has accurate coloring. the one negative is that it does not tell you how much battery you have left until it is very low. i would like a little more warning, or is there's a progress bar, that would be best. if there is one and i just have not found it yet, please let me know!"
2,Lens error after 1 year!,"I love the quality of Canon pictures, but after 1 year of use, we had the notorious ""lens error"". To repair it is more expensive than to buy a new camera. If you google lens error and canon, you will see that this is a common problem with canon cameras. So you are buying a good camera, but it won't last long."
2,Did I get a defective one?,"Read so much about this camera and thought it was perfect.Got one and found it to be a bit bulky to carry around (I had a Casio Exlim prior to this).Took this on vacation and noticed that I was seeing white circles on the pictures when taking shots at dusk. Unfortunately these circles were there when I downloaded the pictures to my computer.Also, all of my pictures (regardless of light, time of day, etc) were overexposed (they didn't look overexposed on the screen on the camera). I realize there were different functions for flash but I was looking for a simple ""point and shoot"" camera.I returned this camera and am still shopping for a simple point and shoot that takes good pics."
3,physical Quality Very poor,"I just opened my new SD800, its physical quality is really poor. The button to click the pictures is loose. When I thought of inserting the battery, its cover seems to be very cheap and I thought ""I better be careful, it can break anytime and I wont be able to return it too"".Can you tell me if its same with your SD800?Weired (little loose) shot buttonVery poor cover for batteryI was disappointed with these so, did not even try to see the picture quality and other features (which I think should be good)"
2,Point and Shoot Review,"Ok, first of all, I am not a professional photographer. I just want a camera that I can point and shoot and get good photos regardless of the conditions. I also want something I can carry in my pocket so that I actually have it handy when my kid does something cute!I bought the Canon Powershot SD800 with these things in mind. The outdoor pictures looked great, but the problems started when I went indoors. Taking pictures in a conference room, some of the pictures were very dark and grainy, even with the flash. Yes, the flash was on automatic. So I retook the picture and this time it looked better. With several repeats, results were inconsistent, even with the flash on. As the day progressed, I handed the camera to others to take some shots, and they came out grainy and dim as well, or overexposed by the flash.I can understand poor performance in poor conditions, but I cannot understand inconsistent performance in the same conditions."
2,picture quality is poor,"I read the review and most of them give this camera a good rating. So I ordered one and use it for a week...and finally I have to return it due to poor quality picture. Compare to my Canon G3 and Nikon Coolpix 5400, the picture of this camera is unclear even though it has more pixel, the color is yellowish, and the multi point focus feature is hard to use. It's just a little bit better than my Cybershot Phone Sony K800. The reason I give this a 2 stars because it has a nice body (metal), a good shape, and the battery. I believe this model is a defetive in design...that's why the Canon have to release SD850 at the same time, and the picture quality of this one is way much better."
2,Little insight - now dated,"If you want to read a book chock full of ""company X did Y with a great result"" with no followup on the long-term viability of what company X did, this is the book for you. Frankly, some three years after publication, I find it dated (unlike, say Blink, or Paradox of Choice). The book seems writtne around the 10th grade level. Perhaps of help to the pure consumer insight neophyte, but if you have studied CB at all, skip this title."
5,An extraordinary CD,"It is truly astounding how far Lora has come over the years. This CD presents a more mature Lora and is perfect for newcomers to his music. It contains such masterpieces as the original radio edit of La Huella and other old favorites such as Canguro y Caballito and Luna de Miel. The real tour de force in the album, though, is the fantastic new release A Punto Estuve, written in collaboration with Marito Rivera. This album is an instant classic."
4,A great refresher,"I was a white nuckle flyer, been to a fearful flying coursewhich made flying much easier, but cost alot and 4 nights of my time. I watched this tape and found it a great review on what was presented in the 4 long days of the fear of flying course I attended. Wish I found this tape first before I spent all the money and time. Great review!"
3,Informative but short.,"Alpine Sentinels is more of a pamphlet that a book. It's only 49 pages. But given the dearth of material available on the Sheep Eaters, it's a book most will want anyway since it does provide a few interesting and unique bits of information about these amazing people who lived in the ultra-rugged mountains of Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana.The other books I would recommend are ""Mountain Spirit"" by Loendorf & Stone and ""Indians in Yellowstone National Park"" by Janetski."
3,Unique story line (for a change).,"One thing this book does exceptionally well is point out how our perception of the unknown--or even what is right in front of us--can be misleading or beguiling, if not flat-out wrong. Kemp addresses the stereotypical aspects of Heaven and allows them to take on characteristics much more in alignment with reality than the usual ""walk into the light"" mentality other afterlife novels propound. A good read, not only for those who love to theorize about the hereafter, but also for the most callous agnostic."
4,A facinating story of love that endures beyond this life.,"If you are bored with the cliche views of heaven and love, then this book is bound to wake you up. The human drama is captivating, and the play between heaven and earth stretches the imagination with creative and moving charactery. Watch out for the ending. It could give you whiplash."
4,"A fresh view of the big picture, along with strange details","This book deserves a review. Not only does it provoke creative thinking about mortality, it also shows the pitfalls of trying to ""plan"" the afterlife too carefully. Unrealistic expectations about ourselves and authority (including God) can cause us to make bad decisions in life.Two things are apparent to me from the viewpoint of the book: One is that ""getting to the other side"" is not an end in itself; this will not automatically or magically perfect someone (as demonstrated by the diligent, but somewhat anal, spirit guide Jonathan). The other is that deity is not limited even in authority and could, in fact, be the guy you flipped off on the freeway this morning.Tom's journey shows how we are linked as families and friends, while proof is usually in the eye of the beholder.The book was just the right length to enjoy without putting my life on hold to finish it. I would have kept reading had it been longer."
2,Thoroughly disappointed,"I liked the first few chapters, but the marital intimacy happened and I started to lose interest. Then the what I hope was inaccurate view of Paradise almost stopped me from finishing what was a great ending! I don't at all agree with the thought that Spirits can't return if they want to. I know that I have felt the presence of those who have passed on that helped me. I don't picture Paradise being a bureacracy by any means! But, I'm sure there will be some people not happy no matter where they end up!"
2,Endure to the End!!!,"Stay with this one untill the end or you may think you wasted your money. The author tries to hard to make heaven a 1998 P.C. place, and to much like comedy central. It was a lovely idea, in the realm of ""When Dreams may Come"", but don't get lost in the things you may not understand."
1,"Unlike the other reviewers so far,","I thought this book was a sorry, contrived piece of tripe. As I read, I kept wondering, ""How did this guy EVER get this pile of gibberish past the first junior editor out of the slush pile??""Then I did a little research and found out that he DIDN'T. This book was SELF-PUBLISHED. No wonder.I'm not religious; maybe that warped my viewpoint.If you insist on reading this book, at least get it from the library first; don't waste your money. If you still like it, fine - then go ahead and buy it. But don't say I didn't warn you."
5,best oil filters,"Hastings and Baldwin filters are the finest, period. It's a shame they are not available in national retailers, but at least we can get them easily via Amazon. Made in America."
3,"A competent job, but lacks real insight","Like many other writers about technology companies, Karen Angel has simply read a lot of newspaper and magazine articles about the company, interviewed some knowledgeable outsiders (key insiders did not cooperate with her) and organized the resulting material in chronological sequence. If, like I, you are interested in learning the basic facts about Yahoo!, this book will suffice, but don't expect anything in the way of new revelations or searching analysis.What comes across is a group of relatively bright young computer nerds who happened to be in the right place at the right time, decided that they were the Christ, and imploded from their own greed and hubris, professing all the while their personal integrity. Urrrppp!"
3,Very Informative but lacks analysis,"The author has used her sources effectively to delineate the Intenet boom and its subsequent fall, by describing Yahoo's growth from a Stanford trailer into a media company. She has captured the frenzy of the late 90's and takes the reader through the numerous accquisitions and investments in Silicon Valley. At the same time the book is an overkill with the excessive information provided and at times reads like an encyclopaedia with figures thrown in liberally. The fact that Yahoo hasn't cooperated with the author is evident in several places. Overall its a good read"
3,"Good description on its early competition & financial history, but doesn't offer real insight","This book gives overall description of Yahoo since their inception to Terry Semel day. It tells about Yahoo's stories on the roller coaster ride during the Internet boom and ends up in the hands of financial analyst and market sentiment after the Internet age is over. A good description about competition with Lycos, Excite, AOL, MSN and Yahoo's effort on various business models and acquisitions. A strong emphasize is on stock market analysis during its ups and downs. But this book doesn't offer real insights on the company and the people behind it."
4,My history,I would like to thank Arty for putting my history in print so that people can better understand a time in America that is worth writing about.Reading this book gave me a better realization of the life i have lived.Learning certain accounts of my life through another's perspective has given me greater appreciation of the lifestyle I was born into. This journal gives accounts of the day to day life of communal living.
4,Commune life,"The author quite likely never dreamed his journals would be published, and consequently his writing style is choppy and unpolished. The value of this book is in the detailed descriptions of commune life, but don't expect a great deal of eloquence. The author covers all aspects of commune life well, but his primary interest is agricultural, resulting in a lot of time spent describing irrigation and crops. For a polished remembrance of commune life try Huerfano: A Memoir of Life in the Counterculture by Roberta Price."
5,Wonderful debut collection.,"Other Fish In The Sea' is a smart, moving, always surprising, and lovingly written collection of short stories that add up to a novella. Elly Fisher is the main character, a woman searching for love in all the wrong places -- even in time -- who comes to understand not only love but herself in the end. It's plain-spoken in beautifully observed language and detail. The marvelous thing about Elly and the other characters that populate the book is that Kusel doesn't contrive to make them artifically witty or hip -- unless they are. Instead the characters reflect real people: some damaged, some maturing, all people in process of becoming. The PW review here is all wrong and says more about the reviewer's need to read about fashionable 'chick lit' characters who aren't real, than being able to accept Kusel's characters who are. 'Other Fish in the Sea' is more lit than chick, and in the end it will move you and make you think ... and feel. I can't wait for the movie"
4,"Good stories, taken on the whole.","I wasn't greatly happy with these stories when I first started the book, but it becomes apparent that the character building is weak initially because it's all filled in with the other stories in the book. They're all connected, in that they are stories from random times in the life of the ""main"" character, Elly, who is a woman in one unsuccessful relationship after another. She's a little crazy, a little neurotic, sometimes trying to hard, sometimes not caring enough, but it's all pretty interesting.She actually mentions my alma mater, Wake Forest, in one of the stories, and it makes me wonder if the meeting with that student in Europe in one of the stories is based on any real life event."
5,Love it,Hey I really like it and thats not only cause one of them is my science teacher Hey Mr. Clark
5,classic movie,A movie with the most fantastic cast. Superb band. A good comedy in the classic sense. A must see movie for kids.
5,Surprising Movie,"This was a very surprising movie; I had not expected it to be funny nor a comedy-love story, but it had both."
5,My favorite musical!,"Robert Preston of course, defines Professor Harold Hill. i have not had toe pleasure of seeing the Matt Broderick version, but can't imagine he could outperform Mr. Preston. The entire cast is stellar. My boyfriend, who's not familiar with musicals, fell in love with this one.Love the Buffalo Bills! Good Night Ladies/Pick A Little, Talk a Little is tops!"
3,loooonnnng,"mediocre musical at best. very drawn out and disconnected in parts. it was no ""the king and i"" or ""the sound of music"""
5,Simply one of the best compilations ever!,"From the most under-rated bands of all time....a great compilation of their music. Contrary to some of the other reviews in this section, Disc #2 is phenominal! They became a different group with each new release and I loved all of them. Especially: 'Full House', 'Angel Delight' and 'Nine'. Great stuff with Trevor Lucas and Jerry Donahue in the mid-seventies. Long live Swarb, Peggy, DM, and Simon for those latter years and beyond!Heck, I'm listening to 'Gottle o' Geer' right now!!!"
1,Disappointed,"I guess that in my mind, Fairport Convention still contains the line up of the Liege and Leif album. I think that the only original member of the band remaining is Simon Nicol. I miss Dave Swarbrick's fiddle (though the guy who replaced him for this performance was pretty close), and I think Dave Mattacks on drums is a great loss. Alas, though I knew that many things had changed, I was disapponted at the way familiar songs has been rearranged, plus to some extent, the material chosen for this CD. I'll be more selective next time."
4,Fans can never be objective...,From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...before Richard Thompson's over rated solo years there was his underrated Fairport Convention Years. This is a great over view and the best FC collection.
2,Review from a new Fairport listener,"Having just listened to this collection for the first time I have to conclude that I'm not a Fairport fan. Although there are a few great moments here and there, most of this stuff comes across as uninspired and twee. The collection gets progressively duller as it goes. Fairport strikes me as a blend of Tull, The Birds and Planxty, all of whom were far more inspired IMHO. If you're a fan, my apologies, if not you may want to seek other sources of entertainment, for example:The Planxty Collection"
3,READ the DESCRIPTION -- all reviews so far are for the wrong CD!,"As the description says, this is a single-disc live recording from 2002.This is NOT ""Meet on the Ledge: The Classic Years"" which ia two-disc anthology of studio recordings from the 1960's and 1970's.FYI."
3,"Good little book, but...","Good little book, but some stunning errors in husbandry descriptions which could be a potential disaster for beginning Mbuna keepers. I highly recommend that aquarists look for at least a second opinion before choosing individual species as described in this book."
3,basic information,Basic information - nothing useful for the reasonably well informed novice wishing to advance his/her knowledge base.
3,"Plenty of info, but not ""complete""","It was nice to have some general information, but it didn't have all the information that I wanted when I was interested in Cichlids."
3,"not bad, could be better","some of the songs seem to be mired in the eighties feel, but the other tunes clearly geared torwards the southern rock feel hit the mark."
3,Not his best but a good story none the less.,This was an early Blackie Ryan story and not his best...still a fun read though. A little less theology and a little more story would have helped.
4,GBIC,this is something we purchased for an installation for one of our customers. The product was priced right and worked for our situation.
5,Very Cool Thump a must crank it up cd,Load Point Pull is a band poised to take off. You have to hear them live to really feel what they are all about. This CD is a killer mix of all that was good in 80's hard rock and all heavy sounds of the 90's. The whole CD is very listenable from start to finish. Love the all the background stuff that is going on in the songs.
5,What a trip!,"Christopher Makos is truly ""top notch!"" (love that silly old term!) He has captured all of ANDY WARHOL here! Thanks Chris! I would love to sit down over dinner sometime! Your stories must be true treasures!:-p"
5,Review of ART and the POWER of PLACEMENT,"This is a terrific book and anyone who goes to museums or works in museums should take a look at this book. Even people with collections at home would benefit.One minor point of distraction though is the right left reversal of the picture of the Nike of Samothrace on the cover of the book and repeated on page 46. She should be striding with the right leg forward, not the left as pictured. I pointed this out to the publisher but they never answered me........Hopefully if they republish the book, the error will be corrected.But don't let that deter you from enjoying this great book...."
5,Outstanding!,"Just purchased the book last week, and cant believe how intense this is! Its rare to find a book that can captivate you for so many hours on end! Thank you Olmond for releasing this one. Hope to see more releases soon!"
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this book after reading the reviews and I,m convinced that the reviews were all written by close friends or relatives of the author. What passes for humor is the use of names such as Al K Haul.Har, Har, Har! The plot relies on short, choppy sentences and little inventiveness of plot. It probably deserves only one star, but I'm loath to downgrade even the worst of writers if they make the effort to be published. I just wish I had not depended on the readers' reviews to judge this novel. I will know better next time.(One might assume because I am not from the Deep South that I don't get the joke. Just to let you know that my granny slopped the hogs and I have even eaten chittlins and pig's feet. I didn't drink any sour mash but that's because of a fierce Southern Baptist background. I got the joke; it just wasn't funny)"
1,Invalid Ring Smooth Foam 16: Navy With Cover,Did not help my back problem and the cover attracts a lot of pet hair. I am using it as a seat for my cat.
1,Not a solution for coccyx bone inflamation,"Not for people suffering from coccyx inflamation.--------------------------------------------------I was having severe pain in the coccyx bone area and i bought this item as per the advice of my doctor. It was not at all helpful for my coccyx bone area and i was unable to use it even once. I had to rush to another shop to get a comfortable one. I am not a person who gives my opinion on all the products; however, No one who suffers from coccyx inflamation should fall into the same trap as i did. They charge a hell lot of money on this crap + shipping."
5,A Must- Read for the Home Buyer,"The Home Buyer's Question and Answer Book gives the reader the crucial, pertinent facts for making a wise homebuying decision. From starting the homebuying process to closing the deal- it's all there in this one handy guide.The layout is easy to follow with in-depth explanations for each section.It has more than 150 questions and answers dealing with this sometimes daunting financial process of purchasing a home."
5,Emergency preparations with application to Y2k,This book is thought provoking and droll. Ice storms and blizzards here in Canada make emergency preparations useful for everyone. Most of the information so delightfully presented here is of use in any of those situations. This book will be valuable even after the Y2k has passed.
4,Best down to earth and fast help to get ready,"I've read a bunch of these now and this one is easy to read and understand. I'm trying to get my church group to use it, becuase it would be good for helping people in the local area when things get rough. Bunch of lists and its funny too!I wish it would have had more stuff on where to buy food and things. But he has it on a website, I guess."
2,"A ""Lemon""","I received this lamp as a gift, it is real cute, I liked the way it looked. But, I only used it for one week and it quit working. I thought maybe the bulb it came with burnt out, but that didn't correct the problem. We are assuming the touch sensor piece is faulty and are looking for one to purchase. I threw the box this lamp came in away, so could not return it, I was not expecting the lamp to quit functioning after only one week of use."
4,For the Little Baker,"My little girl LOVES to pretend to bake! This is a great item, and one of the cheaper ones for the Rose Petal Cottage."
3,"cute idea, but not the quality I expected.","I got this as a gift for a friend's daughter. I liked the idea of the product, but I was disappointed that the oven mit was just a thin piece of material and the muffins were on the small side. I know this is just play toys, but I thought it would be slightly more realistic. The apron string around the neck is 1 size and too big...so that would have been nice as velcro or something to adjust. Not quite the quality I wanted."
4,cute,"cute set. Got on sale with free shipping.you only get 2 cupcakes but they are cute. The apron & mit is nice heavy fabric. The pan, bowl and spoon don't look they will break anytime soon.over all a nice set, found nothing wrong with them."
2,"Accurate, balanced portrait?","Jay Parini's ROBERT FROST: A LIFE, 1999, may rehabilitate somewhat the view of Frost as terrible person, presented in Lawrence Thompson's earlier biography. See Parini, pp.452 ff. Thompson's biography may tend to discourage reading Frost, because of its jaundiced portrait."
5,Great Little Book,This is a short paper by President Reagan that clearly presents the issue of abortion and the sanctity of life. I highly recommend it. Buy two and pass one along to a friend.
1,Hypocrite,"Isn't Reagan the guy who as governor of California signed the most liberal pre-Rowe v.Wade decision bill allowing thousands of abortions to be performed in California. Yes, he was!"
3,Pure Miami Bass,"Why is this CD so hard to find? i guess its because of the lady on the cover (LOL)..Anyway, the best song of this CD is""More Sex"" by Larry B. It originally came out in 1989."
3,"Nice, but...","Pleasantly unassuming vanity project. Cameron is Charlie Haden's wife, which explains the outstanding band in service of a very small voice. Still, the record as a whole has a plaintively charming appeal. There are a few moments when you wonder whether Cameron will make it to the end of the song -- especially when a high note is coming -- but, at least for the (short) 25-minute length of the CD, the simple and tasteful arrangements are quietly effective. The problem is that there are a lot of truly talented jazz singers who would be better served by Haden's patronage, and I couldn't help seeing this nice little record as someone else's big missed opportunity."
1,"NOT SO NICE, BUT","Cameron is Charlie Haden's wife, which DOES NOT explain why any one let this wannabe CD out. not much here to hear. she trys...shes trying. i really wish this was better. MUCH better. ( and i even bought her 2nd attempt. my foolish heart). go read a book."
2,The item did not perform as expected,"The Item is too complicated to assemble and when it was assembled, the item did not work as expected. In fact I have to currently park it up and looking for an alternative."
1,mediocre,"4 out of the 20 songs were good, the rest not worth listening. Not worth the money I paid for it. Same goes for the rest of the collection"
2,Press your back button now,"We're on our second year of using this book in our language arts class, and the general opinion of our class is that we all hate it. The book is ridden with mistakes, factual errors, fallacies, inconsistencies, and many of the same. It does do a little bit of help in defining words, but it definately does a lot of help in confusing our class. An example: what do you suppose the definition ""theory of last things"" means? Or how does a stem, mis, that was ""bad"" for a year and a half, suddenly become ""hatred""? Since when is ""Tango"" derived from the latin stem ""tang"" (it's not)? So, if you're looking for a textbook, try finding one that is less riddled with errors and helps the kids more."
1,Word,these booke es badd the wordes aer toooo beg.hew em i supossede to undrestend werds leke prepilxe und thuw>? i hater theese booke
1,Dr. Scholl Twist Slide,"Original Dr. Scholl's Women's Twist Slide,Black,10 MI was excited to get these shoes, but they are SO uncomfortable. I'm going to return them. Too bad, so sad."
2,"Not terrible, but disappointing","The description should make clear that although the series is called ""Unabridged Classics in MP3"", the title of this volume is ""_Selected_ Canterbury Tales"". I.e. the selected tales are unabridged, not the entire collection.Even more important is to note that the recording is not of Geoffrey Chaucer's actual poetry, but of somebody's translation into modern English."
3,Berlitz French Cassette Pack,"Having used Berlitz book and cassette packs in German, Norwegian, Italian, Spanish and Portugese, I looked forward to studying French in preparation for a trip. However, Berlitz has updated their language presentations with a fucia and purple case instead of the farmiliar yellow box, which no longer includes the handy, quick-referencing,tiny, carry-me-along paper booklet,but only their larger phrase book and dictionary. This was a disappointment. I put in the tape only to find the tape quality had declined and my tape was loosening and binding within the first month of use. I also found lacking the second pronunciation for each phrase on the French tape. This re-enforcement I need to develop my ear and my pronunciation skills in a language. Bring back the old yellow-style boxes, Berlize! You are ruining a good thing!"
1,Not original,Very dissapointed after found not original interpretations for the vast majority of song in this colletion.Could be a zero star if available.
1,You get what you pay for.. or do you?,"I bought a this starter mp4 for my wife. After the ooo and awww of a little video, came the real reason of why it is so cheap.It has battery charge issues like the first generation iPod Shuffle. Bad part is, there is no warranty and support.It is like the Shaq sneakers from Payless. Look great for the first couple of months until it is not returnable. And you can't upgrade to a pair of jordans. Be Warned!!"
4,Ipod Alternative,"There wasn't anything wrong with the two of these products that I bought. I bought a pink and a green one for my brother and sister. It takes somebody that knows how to tinker with computers. Lucky for me, I do. A lot of bad reviews are on these products. That is because people are expecting the ease of use like a real Ipod. These are just look a likes. Of course it won't sync with Itunes. It isn't an Ipod. Of course it's not a real click wheel. It's a $40 mp3 player. It is designed for use for Windows XP. It takes getting used to but once you do, there is nothing wrong with them.Thanks for reading the review."
1,Don't buy it......,"I brought this same exact product couple of months after Christmas. I first got it they sent the wrong cords. And then they sent me the right cord three weeks later. Then the directions that they send you is in a foreign language. It was no way of returning the product. Because when I finally got back on amazon they was so call sold out. But now it is Christmas again, I guess they are pulling the scam again on people. Then when you finally connect it and you think is working, it shut down. This a real piece of you know what, I brought two of these, and I wasted 100.00."
1,"Warning, Buyer beware!",This MP3/MP4 doesn't work in less than 1 month!This software has not passed Windows Logo testing to verify its compatibility with Windows. Installing this software may impair or destabilize the correct operation of your system either immediately or in the future. Microsoft strongly recommends that you do not use this device with your windows software.
4,Great cheap alternative to ipod,"Its just as fashionable as the ipod nano but considerably less expenisive. It is kind of difficult to use, but after time it gets easier. It doesnt have the click wheel but it has the radio, and it plays videos and store photos. The screen is bigger than an ipod's and its very clear. You can pick the color to match your style, its definitely a great buy. Oh and to put music on it you just plug it into the computer and drag the folder or files to the e:drive it becomes."
4,From 1969 - Still Very Valuable,"Most of the time we hear about high blood sugar which is called diabetes. This book is about the opposite problem which is low blood sugar. According to the author, J. Frank Hurdle, M.D., for each person who suffers with high blood sugar there are 7 or 8 more people who suffer with low blood sugar. These 7 or 8 people may not have low blood sugar all the time, but they will have it often enough so that many days at home and at work they are just ""feeling rotten."" The author writes a comprehensive work on how to recognize low blood sugar and how to add years to your life by learning how to maintain good blood sugar control."
1,How come there's no '0-star' rating?,"This book solidified my contempt for the subject of organic chemistry. No wonder it's so cheap. The book is so confusing, it's content so lacking...where did the authors buy their degrees?"
3,"Not perfect, but provides a good overview","Though less formal than a typical textbook, this book practically functions as one. The reading is quick, though the author tends to get carried away on personal tangents. Nevertheless, it provides an impressive overview of cinematic history, from its modest start in the 1890s until the 1990s. One negative aspect is that many films and directors are left out, owing to space constraints, I assume. (the book is over 400 pages!) Still,one great aspect of this book is a list of recommended (historically- and aesthetically-relevant) films at the end of each chapter, sorted by director and year. Also, though America and Hollywood occupy a substantial part of the text, the author makes a concerted effort to give equal historical credence to international movements. A worthy resource for film buffs and students, as well as anyone else interested in the development of cinema."
4,"""Rock Out With Your C**K Out!""","Rock, baby, rock! Buy the disk, and then see them live. Check out, ""Queen of the Motorcross"". Also contains hilarious interviews with comedian Mick Stingley. Too much rock is never enough!"
3,Buyer beware,"Please note that IDI, the manfacturer of this product went out of business in 2003. Support may be hard to get."
4,Great Sci-Fi comic!,"As a huge comic book and science fiction fan, I enjoyed Galaxion very much. It's fun, entertaining and exciting. The art is very high quality with great diseign concepts ( I espiecally loved the strange ship diseign of the Galaxion, which looks like a huge sea shell). I recomend it to comic fans in search of great small press books and Science fistion fans who enjoy the likes of Star Trek: Next Generation and Star wars."
3,Not my favorite firm dvd,I've done a lot of firm videos. This is not my favorite. The transitions are too quick and I don't feel it worked my buns like the FIRM lower body sculpt I. It did raise my heart rate and I felt it in my legs at times but I was disappointed. Her transitions are difficult to understand at times as well.
5,"Good, intense lower body workout!","This is a really good, very intense lower body (buns and thighs) workout. I must admit that it is still difficult (in intensity) for me after using the video for a month now. Please note that you must allow yourself time to get the moves down. The program moves quickly but I had an easier time catching on to this workout than other firm videos I own. The workout is hard and I get a bit winded at times which causes me to pause the video to catch my breath. I consider myself fairly fit and trim but I found this workout to be a good challenge. It has produced noticable results for me which is excellent and motivating. I would recommend it for ladies who need to do some intense target training on their lower bodies but like to get the heart rate pumping and burn some major calories at the same time."
2,Jiggle Free Buns - not great!,I do love the firm but this isn't one of their great videos. There is a lot more low impact cardio then needed - If I have 30 minutes to fix my back side I want a focused work out. The transitions are very fast and the music is more of a cardio based genre. If you have any ankle or knee issues you may struggle feel some pain. Try other firm lower body work outs they give you more focus and you will feel it the next day.
3,Watch out!!!,If you read the reviews for all Firm products you'll see the same exact reviews for different products. It sounds fishy like the company wrote a bunch of reviews and copied and pasted to all their products. I'm not sure how good these are but I would try just one at time to make sure we're not being suckered into buying.
1,Broke out into a severe rash,I have used many other Enzymedica products with great success. So when I was looking for at pro-biotics I thought I would give this a try instead of my old one. I broke out in a terrible rash and swung between severe constipation and severe diarrhea the entire time. I had heard that sometimes your body just needs time to adjust so I kept taking it for 3 weeks straight and my symptoms only got worse and worse. It was terrible. Threw it away. Doesn't work for me. I'm going back to my original brand that worked perfectly.
2,Huge cooler - Overkill?,"This cooler is huge. I bought one of these, but it didn't fit inside my PC case. What good is a CPU cooler if it if it doesn't fit inside your PC?In all fairness, it does have a copper base for better heat transfer and neat-o looking tubes coming out of the base, and due to its size, I'm sure it cools well. Unfortunately, I couldn't use it due to its size."
4,Good Value,"THis bird feeder is reasonably priced and has a lot of pros: holds 5lb of sunflower seed which means less trips outside in the winter, it won't rot like wood, or crack like plastic. Attracts all sorts of birds though the blue jays don't fit well (which is good IMHO). I've had downy and red-breasted woodpeckers, nuthatches, chickadees, cardinals, goldfinches, etc. The one CON I've discerned: it is not squirrel proof in the least. SO, I am going to get a large dome baffle. Still cheaper to get this and a baffle than to buy one of those expensive feeders that are billed as ""squirrel proof."""
2,Not even remotely raccoon-resistant,"If the Martian rover included a bird feeder, NASA would have already discovered life on mars, that life would be raccoons, and the bird feeder would be empty. A couple of raccoons can (and will) empty one of these feeders in about 3 hours. They use the small (but not small enough) slots at the bottom. This company also sells an hourglass-shaped feeder, which has proven to be a little more of a challengenge for the critters."
2,The shoes are fine until it breaks.,"The shoes are comfortable. However, one of the screws fell off after 2 months. The threads are worn out and we cannot screw it back on."
2,No Toe Grip,"Why on God's Green Earth would they re-make these without the very reason they were so great??? These new ones have a tiny bump where the original toe grip is supposed to be, so there is nothing to hold on to. I returned mine. You should too."
2,OUCH!,"The only good thing about these shoes is they're cute. I thought for being Dr. Scholl's they'd be comfortable. I wore them when I went shopping, and ended up getting blisters all over my feet, and it wasn't b/c they were too small either, I had ordered a size up. I wouldn't recommend these unless you want blisters on your feet."
4,carpet,"Works fine for covering speaker boxes. Nice and pliable, durability seems good. Price was reasonable, can't complain at all for the price."
4,only if the color b a little bit more darker...,was hoping for the color to be a little bit more darker... then it will much better for me... but overall... very happy with it...
1,What a waste,"I don't know if this was a movie or someone with a camera and cash decide to do a movie. It does not make any sense from beginning to end. I tried to follow the movie to see where it does make sense, I could not find it. Between the dialogues between sisters, fathers and the visit to their childhood house it's all doll, boring and nothing to learn or gain"
4,Basic Sociology for Community College...,"At first, I did not care for this series but I decided to show Research and Societies(Vol. 3)..which I had rented off of Net Flix prior to purchase of the series. The students became completely immersed and the concepts were clearly developed in the video. As these are all about 30 minutes or so, they are perfect for the 75 minute classroom presentation. At least at the community college level; I would say that these fast-paced,funny but simplistic videos are useful for any introductory Sociology class for primarily first year students.Or even as a referral source for students having great difficulty grasping basic Sociological concepts."
3,Made in Thailand,Has numerous firing bubbles inside on the bottom..will fail eventually..and is made in THAILAND..not FRANCE
1,Poor Quality,Packaging box inside of the shipping box looked like it had been smashed prior to shipping. Item was missing a tightening nut which was a non-standard size. Could not order a replacement nut nor find one in local hardware store that matched threads of bolt. I would not recommend trying this product or manufacturer.
1,Piece of a carpet,"What a rip-off... in this case, the word rip-off is meant both figuratively and literally. I was shocked to open the box and see a piece of carpeting that looks like it was literally ripped from a larger piece of carpet and stuffed in a plastic bag. The packaging was terrible, the carpet is made of good quality material, but its not a clean cut. The piece I received is 2.5ft x 54"" and the short side is the where the cut looks the worst. I should have known something was up with that low price.Yeah its 54"" wide, so you can't get them for false advertising, because the didn't say the dimensions of the other side, slick, but a dirty move."
3,its ok,This carpet is pretty much what I expected for the price. It is not amazing and is a little too stretchy but if you are looking for something cheap this will do good enough and is just about as good as you can get for the price. It is more like a heavy duty felt than a carpet to be honest. The color is nice and a good dark black. Overall I would recommend it to others but ONLY if your not willing to pay a little more for a better carpet. I would say that it is more of a hold over carpet than it is a final product carpet.
5,The best book for women' herbal health!!,"This beautifully written book speaks to women and women's health only. The author realizes the like between human's and God's medicine. She takes us through all seasons of a woman's life. This is a ""must have' book for any herbalists shelf!!"
3,It Comes To You In A Plain Brown Wrapper,"After reading Captain Beefheart interviews for decades it's refreshing to hear what the other guys in the Magic Band have to say about creating their innovative music.This book is a very rare glimpse into the Magic Band by one of their most talented members. Beefheart prefers to shroud his work in mystery, but Zoot Horn Rollo is here to tell the tale. I enjoyed his book a lot."
5,excellent insider view,"The ""Trout Mask Replica"" era Magic Band were an amazing group of people that did amazing things during an amazing time. This wonderful book takes us into that central place. Harkleroad has a weird way of expressing himself, like he's so involved in his music that he has all these strange shorthand terms he's had to coin. It's great. I also got a big kick out of Harkleroad's put down of guitar ""god"" Jimmy Page. Great book for anyone interested in Beefheart and his music, and experimental music in general."
3,The insiders view for once-a fascinating read.,The Beefheart fan should not expect too much from this book.It is very readable(you can finish it in a couple of hours) but it reads like no more than an extended magazine article- a chat with ZHR. There is little solid factual stuff here and no use made of contemporary interviews and reviews.No discography.It is a pleasant read and is as much as you would expect from someone who was 19 at the time and is a musician not a writer. It is good to have the insiders view of the Beefheart band but the more I find out about the creation of great pieces of music the more amazed I am that the thing ever got done-particularly by these people in those circumstances. A spark started the fire and the spark was Beefheart.
5,A nice movie for the family,"I purchased this for my Mom and she really loved the movie.She said it was a good movie, and she highly recommended it! James Mell"
3,Interesting to see a J.D. Salinger story brought to screen,"For years, I have been a fan of Salinger's works. Primarily, this includes The Catcher in the Rye and Nine Stories. This film was an adaptation of his short story from the latter book: ""Uncle Wiggly In Connecticut."" The attempts at realism by star Susan Hayward is a little forward and SLIGHTLY unconvincing, yet you sure as heck have to give her some credit for trying in a difficult role. Dana Andrews is better as a more down-to-earth soldier. My favorite part of the film is the scoring however. Without the terrific musical composition, I would have rated this as only a two star flick. As Maltin said, it does help add to the movie's spice. Victor Young, the composer, is a man of great talent. You can catch his work ""Stella by Starlight"" in the excellent 1944 mystery-thriller The Uninvited."
5,"adventure, romance.","I 'm very satisfied with this dvd,there is different fims and they are very interesting cause you see the good lessons of life.It's a dvd to have in your collection.Thanks again!"
3,Love it again,Beautifully written and enjoyed the story. The characters were believable and it's just like God to keep the people you have issue with in your path until you have resolved it with forgiveness
4,A very good travel guide!!,"I found this travel guide really useful.It gives you a lot of information about places to see, things to go, how to use the public transport, accommodation, etc... Apart from that, this book also gives you a brief historical explanation of the city, its origins and development which I quite liked."
1,Very confusing,"The Amazon listing showed this to be a 2008 edition. When I went back to order a second copy, I could no longer find it - only an older version. After a few emails and some diligent and appreciated work on the part of Amazon, it turns out the edition I received is the old edition with simply a 2008 publication date and a new, updated edition will not be available until the first quarter of 2010. Unless you are leaving for Lisbon between now and the end of the year, you might want to wait."
2,Out of date,"We bought this book for a recent trip to Lisbon. We found it to be out of date. Descriptions were not always accurate, addresses were wrong, opening hours were often not correct. If it were updated, it would be a useful guide."
2,Why Bother With The New Edition???,"If the edition is updated for 2009, you would think they would take the time to edit out *clearly outdated information* like the forward looking statement about renovations being completed in 2004!!While the book is handy guide to the what and where of Lisbon, it is really very sterile and a lame guidebook. Get past the nice color pictures and glossy pages, and there's frankly not much substance.I will not be buying Eyewitness Travel Guides again."
4,nice pickin' and singin',"I picked this CD up after seeing Sayers live at Blue Cafe in Long Beach. He's got a unique approach to songcraft that's nonetheless rooted in blues & R&B, and he puts it all across with plenty of gusto and very little ego. Great stuff, and I look forward to other Hadden Sayers CDs."
3,Okay is all I can say.,"For the price its Boo-Boo..I don't get the hype of this product. It's non-greasy, ok great I guess..??? -but nothing more to add it didn't add anything better to my hair. Not buying again, I'd rather use real coconut organic pressed oil in my hair...which I do now."
1,OMG the chemical burn.,"Way back when, I used to love Brilliant Pomade (that came in a little pump bottle) and I used it frequently.Recently, I bought this and now I have the WORST chemical burn rash on my neck. It's disgusting.And it burns like hell.I don't have sensitive skin and I've never had a problem with any product of this nature. Not sure what's in this but I can't use it.Test it on your arm first. Burns on your nape aren't fun."
1,"Brilliant, No. Stinky, Yes.","This pomade made my hair anything but manageable. I used ever so little, but it created limp, lifeless and oily looking hair. After two strikes, I'm returnuing ir to Aveda, where I purchased it. Thank goodness they stand by their products and have a return policy.Like the rest of the ""Brilliant"" line of products, the fragrance is so vile, that even if the product was brilliant, I would die of asphyxiation. It smells that bad.I also tried the hairspray -- it is sticky and not natural looking or feeling.I will never purchase another Brilliant line prosuct again. I just can't get past the toxic, medicinal smell. How this passed focus groups is beyond me, as my entire family made me re-wash my hair because they could not bear to be in the same room with me. And frankly, I could not bear to be in the same room with myself. Yes, the stench is that bad."
1,Wrong product...difficult packaging,"I was attempting to order Aveda Brilliant Anti-Humectant Pomade, but received Aveda Brilliant Humectant Pomade. The packaging is so similiar. Did not realize until I opened product that I had the wrong item. Either you sent the wrong item or I inadverantly ordered the wrong one because of packaging. I was being very careful to follow every word... so I wonder. ... does Aveda srill make the anti-Humectant Pomade. I am stuck with the wrong item now that I opened the jar. At any rate, I am not a happy customer with a product that will not meet my needs plus I am minus the $22.53 amount spent."
1,Obsolete,"These books were great for the older items they were for, but I had purchased the top of the line, and they did not apply."
1,Basic Mathematics by Man Sharma,"As the college-level math tutor for a student that attends the LA area inner city community college, the format this text used to introduce basic math to the already struggling math student was at best confusing and contradictory. Though the book is used in this LA college's classrooms, its methods of teaching basic math are foreign and would not be considered acceptable in American high school nor elementary school, where elementary math skills are taught. It bares question as to why this text was selected -- possible financial or professional gain. To say the least, I do not recommend this text to anyone on any math level."
5,This Book Just too excellent. You will love Math,"This math book is such a excellent book you will ever come across with. You will start loving math and it shows step-by-step solution. It has enormous examples of questions and lecture note.Just for everyone's and at most Mr. Singh's kind information, Instead of thinking ""Where the book is made from""?, one should think ""How much can you get out of that book"".Thanks."
4,"Finally, something I can relate to",Took me a while to find a book that spoke my language. I took a course a while ago and this book covers and explains the topics in greater detail. Good work resource.
4,Installing and Administering Linux,"After picking up the November edition of the Linux Journal I found an article for the ""In the Trenches"" series of Linux publications by Linda and Al McKinnon. At a local Linux users group meeting, I ran into a fellow bithead who had seen the new offering as well. I bought the book (Installing and Administering Linux). This is the first and best resource that I have had to clarify the foundation for adding productive and manageable Linux boxes into my existing NT/SUN/AS400 environment. No B.S. Just the goods needed. Not for the faint of heart. Microsoft Beware!"
1,Useless,"One word: humbled. I consider myself a car buff and take pride in maintaining my car's looks and mechanical condition. I give any device that saves labor without cutting corners a fair shake. So when I thought I could shave a few minutes off my bi-weekly wash-dry-polish-wax routine, I wanted to give it a shot - after all the California duster worked great for me.But the dry blade was an utter disappointment. After several tries at all kinds of angles and varying amounts of pressure, all it did like another reviewer said, was ""stick & jump & bump"" all over my car's paint. It even left ugly white marks which I had to buff off.Sent it right back and am back to microfiber towels for drying."
1,Not all its cracked up to be.,"Bought this thinking that I would lessen my drying time. Not so, I still need to have my Absorber with me to get all the water it leaves behind. Also the entire blade is flexible so it makes it more difficult to use."
3,"Mehh, it works",I have mixed feelings about this thing. It does work. On flat surfaces it's a slick way of moving most of the water off. On areas with trim and bends it's a lot slower than using a towel. I generally use it to push off most of the water and then go back with a towel. I suppose it might save me from having one or two more towels in the laundry after I wash the car.
5,Classic book on pearls,The pearl hunter recounts Leonard Rosenthals adventures chasing fabulous pearls. He is one of the old experts of pre cultured pearl days who fought in the courts against the notion that pearl plated beads were actually pearls. He lost.
2,Tasteless...,"I was hoping this would be good and really wanted to like it... was kind of like eating wax... I prefer a more bitter and deeper chocolate flavor. I enjoy the taste of dark chocolate. This bar seemed to be trying to mask the flavor of chocolate so much that there was nothing left. sadly disapointed. I like some of other sugar free chocolates, while more bitter, they are better."
1,Awful chocolate to a gourmet chocoholic,"I am a serious chcoholic (preferably dark), and have been buying lots of high end bars for years (Vosges, Michel Richart, La Maison du Chocolat, Venchi, etc.). I cannot stand Hershey's, even their more upscale bars, and can barely tolerate Ghirardelli; Lindt is acceptable if nothing else were available.Vosges makes two sugar free bars, Barcelona and Red Fire; the Barcelona is ""deep milk"" (I prefer more like 65-70%) and the Red Fire is too hot for me. So I have been buying and trying all the other sugarless chocolate bars I can find. I have trouble eating any of the sugarless chocolate bars Amazon sells. I'll keep looking for high end sugar free chocolate bars, but meanwhile I'm sticking with the two Vosges."
3,1 cake so far,"I've made 1 cake. Unmolded perfectly. Had to envision it filled to figure which side was up and which was bottom (Wilton should label them). Filled it with ice cream. The problem is, a frozen cake is dry and crumbly so I cannot get a pretty slice. Makes a nice ice cream cake, but so far, no one can tell that it's a heart center. Maybe something NOT ice cream in the center is the answer?"
1,:(,"I also thought I would be getting the heart-shaped pan, but I ended up receiving the normal pan instead, which I already own. I will just buy this in the store, I guess!"
3,tasty fill cake pan,don't know yet how good they'll do but they are VERY small!i could never find the size listed anywhere and was very surprisedat how small they are. no bigger than 4 inches.
5,Wilton Tasty Fill Set of 4 Mini Cake Pan Set,"Great little pans to make little ice cream cakes and/or filled cakes serving 2-4 people. Now that my children are grown and out of the house, it's nice to make desserts that accommodate just my husband and I so these little pans are just perfect for us and/or making individual cakes for my kids and friends."
4,Cute and Useful - Need more pans or less cake,"These are so cute and useful, great size cake for two. I used cooking spray with built in flour and the cakes popped out effortlessly. But I agree, a box of cake mix makes about 6 sets of these mini cakes. I wish there were instructions on how to make just enough to fill these. I guess I'll make cakes for the neighbors at this point."
1,"Look, don't touch!","A beautiful fabric but snags easily! When a thread is snagged, it pulls through the design and cannot be repaired. Not for heavy use. Mine actually came with snags and was returned!"
4,What can you say... It's the Dukes!,"Well, the show was what it was. Just simple, family, turn off your brain and have some fun for an hour, fun. Season four was a good one, and something you can sit down and watch with your kids... a rarity these days. Pick up a copy and enjoy!"
5,"Super, great.","I like this item because since i was a little boy, I always love the Dukes of Hazzard TV Series and now that I can own it on DVD, it is just great. I hope that the company made the new releases of the series soon, so that way I can get more fun."
4,Welcome to Hazzard,A must have for any Hazzard fan. Well designed boxset with some tasty extras enjoy.
1,Reviews that are not.,"The George Jetson, ""review"" of this item clearly is not. It is yet another non-review.Along with other Sibrel items for sale here. This has been, ""Sock Puppet"" reviewed.A Sibrel supporter just comes along and posts a glowing piece. How clever.Another Sibrel DVD is reviewed here, on Amazon(Astronauts gone wild). A review author admits to not having seen the movie, but gives it a five star vote!I've not watched this particlar Sibrel orffering, so I can not pass judgement.I do however wish to warn those that consider purchasing Sibrel products, he and his fan base are dishonest."
1,Nazi Minister of Propaganda and Theologian,"Just a note on Kittel.""Kittel wrote a 10 volume Biblical Greek Lexicon Kittel's Theological Dictionary of the NT. The first 7 volumes were written while Kittel was Hitler's Minister of Propaganda, while the last three volumes of his Biblical Greek Lexicon were done while he was in jail for his War Crimes.""[...]"
1,No Drivers for Windows 7 64 bit on CD. Not working with Polar Software.,"Just received a few days ago. Following install instructions in package, found that there was no directory for Windows 7, only Vista and older OS's. Searched around on CD and verified.After reading other reviews, just plugged into USB port and let Windows 7 locate and install automatically, which printed directions said not to do. Drivers did install without error messages, but will not load data from Polar S625X. Just blinks and quits. Will update if I can figure this out... but I do have an IT degree, and hate little issues like this. Would rather pay the $20/$40 more for a 5 second install.Assuming that since this is aftermarket(non-Polar), Polar will not be overly useful if I contact them..."
1,No Windows 7 driver,"Despite the fact that windows 7 loads a driver, it doesn't seem to work. The documentation advises to uninstall the auto-loaded driver then load or download the latest driver for VISTA or XP, etc. There are no Windows 7 drivers nor updated documentation, etc on the CD or the download site. If you don't use Windows 7 you are probably going to be fine with this item."
1,Poor Product,This is an extremely poor product. There was no .exe file included with the enclosed disk. I am running Vista 64-bit and even their website did not contain the appropriate .exe file. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY !!!! And thanx for providing a customer service number to call....NOT !
4,Infra-Red Communication Device,I bought this device to allow my Dive computer to communicate with my PC. It akes a while to connect and it is not the fastest but for the money it does the job.
3,Real trouble dealing with Windows 7,"This thing is fine if you can get it installed properly. I bought it to syncronize with an older Palm device (Zire 31). Unfortunately, Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit has a utility in it that takes control of this device. I cannot seem to get the Palm HotSync software to access the IR adapter because Windows blocks it. There's probably a work around, but I haven't found it yet.By the way, I cannot find any Windows 7 drivers for this device in the package or on the web. It works alright with my Windows XP and Vista machines. But if you're looking for an easy fix for a Windows 7 machine, forget it. Again, there might be a work around, but you'll have to do some work to sort it out."
4,"Great, but the installation","This product works great, but I'm glad I talked to a buddy about it. He said to skip the installation disk if it doesn't work the first time. He couldn't get it to work, but was able to install it online. Online is how I got the install to work. Product works great now."
4,Driver Issues Solved,Couldn't get this to work with Windows 7 64-bit at first. Plug and play didn't work as others suggested. After some Googling I found the company website with a list of available drivers. Check here if you are having issues and need drivers: [....]
5,Funciona perfecto con Uwatedc Galileo Sol y Windows 7 64 bit,Para instalarlo en Windows 7 64 bit le indique que ubicara el controlador que vienen en el CD y funciona perfecto. No se hizo por WindowsUpdate como se dice en otros comentarios. La sincronización con la computadora de buceo se hizo sin problemas. Mucho más barato que el Polar.
5,saved my old laser printer from the trash dump,"i recently replaced my desktop computer with a new laptop. when i ordered the laptop i forgot that my laser priter needed a centronics printer cable to hook it to a computer. after a few choice words about not having some way to hook it to my new laptop i noticed that it had an infra-red port in front. this little device and an extension cable solved the whole problem. it installed itself with windows 7 and when i added my old laser printer to the laptop it found the drivers, installed them and printed the test page without any problems."
5,Great after you ignore the instructions,"It comes with a mini-CD. The instructions caution you to put in the CD first, go to a certain directory and run setup.exe. The problem is that there is no setup.exe in that folder. Underneath the folder they specified are folders for different operating systems. I went to Vista32 but still no setup.exe or any files that can be run directly. In the end, I put in the IR adapter (with CD still in drive), and windows Vista 32 seemed to find the drivers for it by itself.I'm using it to download SCUBA dives from my Smart Com dive computer. I don't know the exact download speed, but it seems to be faster than the old IR adapter I had.As with my old IR adapter, it does seem to have a problem if it is facing too much light though. I guess this is probably a common problem, but this IR adapter came at a nice price."
1,Will not work under Linux,"Despite hours of attempts, this simply does not work with any variant of the mcs7780 drivers under linux, or any other drivers for that matter. It seems a known problem in a number of web forums, and so far there doesn't appear to be any resolution. So don't buy this for any Linux application."
3,"A slow start, but finishes nicely","This novel by Wendy Coakley-Thompson focuses on an attraction between older woman Chaney and younger man Devin, who happens to be a veterinarian. Cousins by marriage (her sister married his cousin), it is not the former family relationship that bothers Chaney in regards to her attraction to Devin. Rather, Chaney looks at biracial Devin as cute but young and doesn't initially give her attraction to him much credence. Brought together initially by the dog Chaney is babysitting for her sister, the first half of the book focuses on their separate lives and intermittent interactions centered around the dog. Each has family and work issues that are consuming their lives.After a rather slow start, the story finally picks up and heats up in the second half and takes off on a more interesting run as Chaney and Devin explore their attraction in greater depth.This book was interesting but a bit slow in parts for my liking."
5,Engaging educational series for children,"Intrepid Ms Frizzle and her curious young students are back with another great show, well, three episodes actually: In ""Wet all Over"", Ms Frizzle shrinks everyone to teardrop size to learn about the water cycle, in ""Rocks and Rolls"", the class goes on a rocky adventure to discover how erosion takes place, and in ""Ups and Downs"", the gang heads for the bottom of Walkerville Lake for another adventure.Total running time is about 80 mins and the language options are English, Spanish and French. My 5 year-old loves this series and it's a great way to cultivate her interest in science. Highly recommended!"
4,My son (4) doesn't like this one as much,"I really don't know why, but my 4 yr old son doesn't like this video as much as the other Magic School Bus videos (which he loves). I think it's great - educational, entertaining, and wholesome. My son's favorites are the Human Body and Space Adventures videos."
3,Deadly deception,It is a good book but not easily readable. Kind of messy. The author meant well but I don't like his style. Here in Europe we are 20-30 years behind in the news about this subject so in that sense it is better than nothing.
4,Samples of this kind of music are inadequate ........,"The Paul Reisler sound is unique, and the title track ""Moon Run"" is a lovely example of it at its best. The sample here only gives you a small taste of the enjoyment to come.Similarly, my other favorite track on this album, ""In The Hills Of Shiloh"", is not done justice by the sample. You have to wait till the last verse of this song to hear both women combine in individual and harmony vocals, which, highlighted by the perfect instrumental and vocal arrangements, are equal to the most spine-chilling vocals I've ever heard. And I say that as a listener who has enjoyed very few of the vocal performances by this group. Usually I find the vocal doesn't fit the song, or vice versa, but I have no hesitation in saying the last minute of this song blew me away. If you buy the mp3 of it, make sure you get a copy of the lyrics."
4,good for kids who are beginning to rhyme,"Sturdy, attractive cards. The color matching provides scaffolding for little ones just beginning to grasp the concept of rhyming. My 3-year-old began to use this when she was 2. I selected a subset of these cards for us to match together. This was a gentle way to introduce rhyming, matching and the simplest of puzzles. My 5-year-old sometimes brings this out by herself to revisit it and enjoy the illustrations."
1,Does not really help kids learn rhyming,I was looking for a game to help my 4 year old daughters learn how to rhyme. This game is far too easy because all you have to do is match colors and not think at all about rhyming. I do not recommend this game at all. The maker should have thought to at least pick one or two colors for the puzzle pieces to avoid kids just relying on color to make matches rather than actually learning about rhyming.
1,Fails the long-term durability test,"The Wein slave, when it worked, was fairly decent. Synced in sunlight off of a plain old optical slave. Some flashes won't work with it, most notably the latest Vivitar 285HV flashes. And if you try to trigger it with your E-TTL flash, it'll trigger poorly.But the real problem? Well, use it for a year or two and it'll mysteriously stop working. First my older one died. Then the newer one died. And there's no warning, one day you'll have a model over to photograph and all of the three-light setups you have in mind will have to be done with two lights.For the price, it should last."
5,Excellent.,Fantastic introductory accounting book. Goes into more detail than the professor is likely to cover in an introductory course. Key topic: Cash flow.
5,Had to get it for a class,"Because it was a forced read, I didn't necessarily snuggle up to it each night. After my Accounting class ended, I kept it to refer back to for my business purposes and it is a helpful reference."
1,No Contract Length information,Service agreement keep saying early termination and all the other clauses. However it did not mention the term of contract or length in years. I think this is important information and should be mentioned in main plan page.
4,A great service,"I have been with Verizon for almost 8 years and moved to AT&T; coz. of roll over minutes feature as part of the plan. Sony ericsson is a great phone except as mentioned in the cnet reviews, the cons remains with it.The service with AT&T; is great, no loss of call or echo in the voice as mentioned in other reviews. I believe that it's not the service but the mobile instrument that the echo and voice clarity is dependent upon."
3,AT&T Family Talk,I am working for goverment and AT&T is not giving me 15 % discount on total bills. They told me before I bought service that I will received discount on total bills and also in my account shows discount on internet. When I received bill only main line gets 15% discount.
5,Dragon Necklace,"This necklace is fun and flirty. My grand daughter has it as part of her birthday gifts, and as she collects dragons, she was so happy to recieve this."
5,The Sleeping Boy,"This is one of the best novels I've read in years. What a good buy ! As soon as I finished it I gave it to my neighbor to read so that we could talk about it. She loved it as much as I did, but for different reasons. I was swept into this world of intrigue by the characters that were so well described. My neighbor felt it was the sharpest suspense novel she's ever read. It's not at all the usual cookie-cutter mystery. This is a unique story & way of writing. We will be watching for another novel by Stewart.P.S. I have bought two more to give as Christmas presents."
1,Bad Order Fulfillment,"Simply put, their order picking process/quality control checks are missing. The jacket arrived within the expected timeframe, but the wrong CD was in it. Now because of their mistake I need to go through the returns process which is a waste of my limited time."
5,Office,A co-worker brought this in to the office one day and it was great. I'd recommend it as an office CD.
5,Johnson's Cockers,"I recommended this Book for any and All American Cocker Spaniel Owners or breeders. It has several photographs of excellent quality cockers. Good info on Breeding, Genetics, Health and Coat Maintenance. An all around great Coffee table book for All. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
5,Great Book for cocker lovers,This is a great book and a must have for cocker lovers and breeders. All the ancestery behink your dogs in one place. Fantastic price as compared to other sites.
4,Don't buy - an updated version exists!,"A good introduction to the 'current' state of XML as of December 1998. Wrox press are about to publish an updated version of this book as 'Professional XML' in February 2000.The book is a bit frustrating at times since has to deal with matters that have not been finalised, and has constant references to sites where updated details can be found. This is probably the biggest stumbling block for XML as a whole, irrespective of which XML book you buy.The book is, at times, a bit dry, and could benefit with more code samples.Overall a very good introduction to XML - but buy the updated version of the book!"
3,Lot to be worked,First few chapters are good. Then this book takes a sudden twist; getting harder in the latter chapters...Plenty of room for improvement
1,Any old tom dick and harry's 0.02$ about XML,There wasn't one solid case-study or example application which demonstrated how to actually manipulate an XML Structure. Many of the screenshots are fakes. There are far too many forward references. This book was written using Cut & Paste. Almost exclusively Microsoft based -- do Micrsoft own this publishing company?
1,Intensely Frustrating,This book really made me feel stupid. I only got throught the first three chapters before giving up. The book was at least three times as difficult to read as the material warants.
4,"Well Balanced, Great Examples","This book is well balanced in its discussion of history, XML, XSL, XLink, displaying XML, and case studies. The historical introduction is well done, and doesn't drag on and on. The discussion of XML is written in english, building with simple examples to more complex. The case studies were all using Microsoft products, but concrete examples really illustrated key XML concepts. Although the discussion of XSL is probably one of the most up-to-date I've seen, caution on the examples. The XSL formatting discusion tries to go into detail, but can be difficult to follow.One of the best XML books I've seen."
2,Boring,I fell asleep reading this book several times. I don't think it is the beast way to teach theory. :(
5,A lover of historical fiction.,I like this book because it was sweet and fun. I loved that Rose never gave up. I also loved the ending.
3,Only OK,"I have seen the movei ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" and it is one of my all time favorites. I just love Robin William's acting in that movie! I had known for some time that the movie was based off a book ( I had read one by the same author) and thought it would be just as good as the movie. Boy was I in for a surprise!The book isn't bad, so much as it isn't very good. The ending is not satisfactory. the dad isn't allowed to see his kids as often as he would like, but more than he should ( I mean, he nude models for an art class and SMOKES, for pete's sake!) in my point of view.Alltogether, it's OK if you want to read it, but it's rather a pointless read, I think."
2,Alias Madame Doubtfire,"Fine, Anne.(1988).Alias Madame Doubtfire.Boston:Little Brown & Co.It is sometimes said that all children of divorce secretly wish to have their families once again united under one roof. Christopher, Lydia and Natalie Hilliard were no exception. Their father, Daniel, is a nere do well sometime actor sometime nude model. Mother Miranda is a wealthy, successful but high strung and tense executive. The parents do a terrible job of keeping their caustic and hateful battles to themselves. Mom needs a babysitter. Dad needs a job. Enter Madame Doubtfire, alias daddy. In this work of realistic fiction the children are confused but wise, the parents are petty and hateful toward each other and inconsiderate of the children. This could be a funny, lighthearted book but it really isn't."
1,Disappointed,This battery does not perform like the Kodak battery does; it drains quickly and its performance is not acceptable.
3,Does not work with Radio,"I am generally satisfied with these speakers, however there is one thing that was quite disappointing. I cannot use them to listen to the radio. The radio funtion in my cellphone K-750i requires an antenna, which is apparently only available in a hands free."
4,underrated singer,"I thought Gwen Guthrie one of the better female vocalists honing her craft in the 1980s. She had some deliciously addictive tunes; soulful and spunky, packed with rhythms to make you dance. Her ballads were nice too, but I always preferred the uptempo tunes. On this balanced collection of her material you get a taste of both. I'm sure there are a few tunes that diehard fans miss having on here, but the 13 album tracks (track 14 is a remix of the classic Ain't Nothin' Goin' On But the Rent"") on this CD will give you a satisfying sample of what this underrated singer was all about. Very happy to have these fine songs on one CD."
4,on Gwen,"I always noticed on many of my albums (way back when...) a lot of the backing vocals were by Patti Austin, Gwen Guthrie and Vivian Cherry. My first Patti Austin album was ""Havana Candy"" (one her best). I first heard Gwen in the forefront on Quincy Jones' ""Stuff Like That"" album singing ""Takin' it to the streets."" I loved the easy, smoldering way she sang the line ""won't you take this message to my sisters and brothers... poverty and despair"" I think it's one her and Luther Vandross better recordings. I bought her first album unheard becauseher backing vocals and that song. This is a good compilation, it does not include her some of her best vocal work. The CD was more valuable for me for the liner notes. I didn't know 'til this year (2004) she died, rest in peace. BTW, all the longer versions of Gwen songs were available on vinyl. I know I have 'em. I don't know that's there's Gwen album/cd I don't own. Smoldering, easy vocals!"
3,Islam in 101 questions,"As the name of the book says, author explains Islam in 101 questions, first 50-60 about history and fundementals and remainig more contemporary issues and politics such as Israel, growth of Islamic population, etc. Best part is that Author provides paralell or comperable concepts from other religions. About more contemporary issues answers are more from current state policies rather than directly from Islam. In other words it sounds like author claiming that the policy of an Islamic Country seems to be Islam's answer to the current issues which may not be correct all the time. I found the last third of the book not as satisfactory as or reliably information source. A quick comperative source book that makes everybody happy in what they believe."
4,Seen The SNL Stuff,"Wow, finally a DVD of Saturday Night Live from the mid-80's from someone other than Eddie Murphy! I've seen the swimming sequence with Martin Short at least a hundred times. This alone makes it well worth the price.Harry Shearer is hilarious in the Sixty Minutes Spoof. Seems pretty strange/weird that it's being released just went Mike Wallace is retiring.I'm going to place this on my wish list, and hope that someone buys it for me as part of a wedding gift. I'm getting married in July!"
1,Why put out such a shoddy DVD?,"I must agree with everyone who has posted reviews on Netflix, this is a really shoddy product. It's really lame to put out a DVD with 9 old sketches with zero introduction, zero information about who, what, where, when. Damn, Harry, it's really sad to see such a poor quality product being put out there. Fortunately, Christopher Guest and Martin Short are in a few of the sketches and are excellent. If you want to see good comedy on a worthwhile DVD check out Best in Show, This Is Spinal Tap, and A Mighty Wind."
3,"Good Consice Grammer, but not good for beginner","I don't recommend this as a first GNT grammer, Hewitt is better. But it is a great summary grammer for those already trained in GNT. I use it to refresh myself on issues, since its brief and well organized."
2,NO SOURCE CODE,"The author seems to know a lot about remoting(the only part I have read so far) and the theory sounds great, but when you type in the code, a lot of time it doesn't work (especially on multiple machines). Apress has a lot of books like that. This book itself is not bad; however, if there's no code that's runnable, you tend to think: Does he really preach what he practiced? I would really like to see publisher go this extra miles to provide workable code for this type of books."
1,Its a pity that there is no sample source code to be downloaded !,"I've bought it for several weeks, it's a good book, but there is no source code for downloading ....And I've contacted with APRESS customer service personel, but he said that it is due to the author not upload their source code to APRESS web site, I believe that ""a good book must provid not only the content, but also the good using environment (ex: source code for downloading, or CD )""I wish that APRESS or the authors can see the comment, and provid source code as soon as possible, not just provide ""Table of Content"", its too poor ..."
2,Really is for dummies: make sure you're dum enough,"This book is well suited to eight year olds and adults who prefer a cute writing style to er, ahem, actual information. One of the things I was looking for was help backing up to a second hard disk. The book says to start NTbackup and read the help screens.Duh. I sent it back."
3,Learn what I did not know,"I got this book in the hope to use it to fix my Windows XP that completely crashed. So, for no luck but, I am hoping buy using this book I can stabilize it enough to get files of it it and then transfer them to Windows 8 which came with my new computer I had today buy."
4,Boon for Luddites,"Like other ""for Dummies"" titles I have seen or used this volume is well organized and helpful for a non-tech like me. I imagine it is helpful for more experienced users also."
2,"Too cute ..not funny, just a waste of time.","Leonhard does an excellent job of explaining how to do things in XP, but you must skip through several pages of really awful attempts at humer to get to the real subject.Showing filename extensions is a good example. He starts that subject on page 85. On page 87 he gives 5 steps in bold type which explains exactly how to get XP to show filename extensions. But pages 85, 86 and most of 87 are pure garbage with respect to the subject. Just before the 5 steps on page 87 he insults the reader with a complete paragraph about pointing your finger at the computer screen and shouting "" Show me filename extensions, sucka, or I'm gonna getcha!"".The book is 80% junk and 20% well written advice."
1,How Dumb Are You?,"Woody has dissappointed us with this shallow book. It has none of the deep insight, hints, tips, and tricks found in his earlier books.No help on many details of my not so difficult install.No help on the many things that went wrong.No details of the oh-so-poorly documented Microsoft provided remedies.No explanation of where ""My Documents"" really goes or gets named in the three install options (Upgrade, New on Separate Drive from other MS OS, New on Same Drive as present MS OS)I must not be dumb enough. I found so little of value.I offer this book for re-sale to some real dummy."
3,Just Coasting...,"One of the finest and most useful books I ever studied and re-studied was Woody's ""MOM for Windows."" Woody and company really explained Windows and gave you the tools and confidence to dig in and get the most out of the operating system with behind-the-scenes customization tips.Either Windows XP is absolutely opaque and no longer amenable to friendly hacking -- or Woody is coasting on his reputation with this book for dummies. I cannot believe that a few game cheats and other odd bits are the only features to XP that haven't been sufficiently explained by Microsoft marketing products.Woody and company may indeed be between a rock and a hard place in trying to delve beneath the surface of XP. I do not know. But this book has done nothing to diminish my ignorance."
4,whats the beef,"I just don't get what some of these complaints are about this book. Yeah it's short but how I understand it is it was meant to be short - an introduction to Neil Young. And that was exactly what I was looking for. I've only just started getting into the man (yeah, I know!) and I didn't want to plough through 600 pages, but this really gave me a lot of insights into his character and his life and made me want to read further. Now I'm going to buy Jimmy macDonoughs book. But if you want something to the point and well written I would recommend this"
2,Slight.,"After reading this biography, I've no more insight than I would from reading cd liners. Very little insight into the characters in his life; nothing more than say CS&N's large egos. No interviews from on the scene characters, old band mates for ex. This book does not do justice to its subject."
1,WHAT??,"I was very excited to get started on this book but about 15 pages into it, it states that Neil was at Woodstock and mentions CSN as ""sidekicks"". It was very wrong. I was truly dissapointed."
4,To this day I still only take showers,"I first saw this as a kid and I just knew the next adult I made angry was going to float me in the tub. Creepy movie. I suppose old nanny didn't do it on purpose, but what a convenient little accident."
4,Classic Bette Davis,"Bette Davis is at her usual creepiness in this classic cult flick. With the new DVD quality and captioning, it's even more fun to watch. Is she to blame for the childs death? OR is the little brother really the architect of this macabre tale. A must have for any Bette Davis collector."
4,A must have movie for any Bette fan!!,"When I was little, my aunt recorded this movie from tv onto a VHS tape and I watched it countless times until that tape wore out! For years, I have looked for it on dvd so I am thrilled that it is finally out! This movie is suspensful and fantastic - you think that the nanny really is up to something...but there is a twist ;) This movie is fun and even though it was made 40 years ago, it doesn't seem dated. If you love Bette Davis, you should own this movie. I'd also recommend the book that Davis' daughter wrote called, My Mother's Keeper."
3,Not as good as I hoped.,"Yes, this book contains wideranging analysis of the 1999 NATO air war against Yugoslavia, but the analysis is surprisingly biased in tone and focus. Explanations of American diplomacy are idealised and too darned patriotic to be much use, and Ms. Albright's gross strategic blunders get under-reported. From start to finish the war was wrong, misguided and dreadfully executed. Some of these points get made in passing, some in point. But all stuff-ups are other people's fault, especially NATO partners, and America hardly gets its propagana-driven reputation tarnished."
1,Stupid Stupid Stupid,This DVD I purchased will only work in European DVD players. Waste of my money. I will not do business with these folks in the future.
5,Strong but distinctive,"This cologne is heads and tails above the rest of the colognes I own. My girl asked me to purchase this, telling me that the scent drove her nuts, and that she would not be able to keep her hands off me if I wore it. I was skeptical at first, but needless to say, she was correct :).I've also asked other women about this cologne, and most agree this is one of the best scents they've sampled on a man.The scent is strong, but it's a scent that is distinctive and complex and that I instantly enjoyed. This Joop is definitely not ""girly"" (disregard the purple-colored bottle/liquid) or for the faint of heart.Highly recommended, fellas (and to you ladies wishing to purchase a new scent for your man)."
2,Real or Fake?,"I'm not sure but, the cologne I bought doesn't seem quite right. Even the title on the bottle seems wrong. Shouldn't it say ""eue de toilet"" on the front? Or something like that. It seems watered down. Not as strong."
5,Joop,I am very pleased with my purchase. I saved $20.00 buying thru Amazon plus I didn't waste any gas.
3,Product was fine but shipping should have been faster,"The product was fine. I like this brand and have used it for years. Price was fine as well. However, as I pay for Amazon Prime each year and this item is listed as Prime eligible, I was QUITE displeased to get it 6, yes SIX, days later! What's up with that Amazon!?"
2,"I got headache, girly smell",I'm 27. I purchased this perfume because of the good reviews I found here. The scent lasted for more than 12 hours. I got headache and I find the scent more feminine than manly. Its too sweet like vanilla. It reminded me of perfumes wore by old women. I used this once and won't be using this again. I'll just give this perfume to somebody else.
1,Joop=poop,This stuff is horrid! My husband bought this and it makes me so so sick. It smells like baby powder and nastiness! I hate it.
5,good stuff,"Some reviews said musky in a european sort of way, what ever that means. All I know is it smells good and people notice it in a nice way."
4,4 Stars,"This Whole Process was very easy. I got a confirmation saying that my order was being processed within about an hour of my purchase, and the product delivered on schedule in Great Shape. I'll be Ordering again in the future. JOOP is a Great Smelling Cologne. But I actually ordered it as an Xmas gift for a Woman. She loves this stuff. The ONLY Downside is that its pretty Expensive; But worth it."
5,"Heavenly, Sexy Scent","This is the same cologne which I first caught a whiff of as a teenager in high school- we had a school coach that wore it all the time! I finally asked him the name of it and he said ""Yoop"" pronounced with a Y which would be the french spelling.Anyhow, for years and years I searched for ""YOOP"" cologne and finally came across Joop!It has a scent that I can not describe, and anytime I smell a male wearing it- oh my gosh it is like I want to chase & follow.Anyhow, My hubby wears it (i wear the womens) and just WOW is all I can say-- nothing can compare with the vanilla, woodsy, jasmine sandalwood scent :)"
1,Joop disappointment!,"I bought this cologne from Amazon, thinking I was buying the same product I used to buy from pharmacies and departments stores. I was wrong! The product is definitely not the same. Every time my husband uses it, he says: ""This is not the original one, it smells different and does not last the same, please don't buy it on Internet never again."" I love Amazon and I think it is the greatest online store, but I am going to go back to Walgreens, when it is time to buy Joop! again."
1,super fake,"Even before I opened I noticed the color was different! anyway once opened it is dissolved on water or something like this, it doesn't smell like the original not even close and of course it last about 10 minutes!, I usually stock up with this product because I use it every day and I always buy it with the after shave package from another supplier here in Amazon and always good, I will keep buying from old and trustable supplier. If anyone wants a video I can upload it so everybody can see the color difference. I thought I already wrote a review but I could not find it so here it is again. so sad....."
3,Poor Dvd Sound,"While I am not an expert on Wagner operas, the cast in this recording was renowned. The video quality is ok, but I would have expected better from DG. The sound quality is poor, however, with dropouts throughout the DVDs. This is the second DG/Met opera from the late 1990s I have purchased and would have liked to have known the quality. The same comments apply to the Met Turandot, except that the video angles are worse."
2,A bit weak,"The book is written for a fan of the show who has average intelligence; unfortunately, the average fan is brighter than that. Much to much of the obvious and not enough insight. A decent book at best."
4,The Prisoner book,"The book breaks down each episode so if you've seen the complete series then you can skip about 2/3 of the book. The remainder of the book gives an analysis of themes that are repeated in the series: defiance, escape, and even Number 6 being seen as a Savior of the village and society. Neat read if you want to read more into the series."
3,The book that admitted it about McGoohan,That he had problems with intimacy on the set of his tv show The Prisoner. He never did kiss any pretty lady on the mouth on his tv show. This book testifies by a crewmember of the Prisoner that McGoohan had trouble with intimacy on the set of the show.
1,You Can Make a Point Without Committing Blasphemy,"I was initially eager to read this book, but was disheartened to read, on page 5, that Jack Welch, new CEO of GE, made a comment ""even God couldn't fix"", referring to the ""major consolidations, combinations, reconfigurations, and jettisoning of business units"". Most presumably educated top leaders within organizations are articulate and are able to verbally communicate effectively without having to resort to juvenile expressions such as this, which are offensive to Christians. NOTHING is too hard for God, and He can fix anything! If I had known that this offensive statement was included in this book, I would have never ordered it, period. This ignorant, careless statement cast a poor light on the remainder of the book, and I did not really care to read any further than this blasphemous comment about Almighty God."
2,Good Idea - Bad Book,"I completely agree with the reader who said that this book could have been written much more effectively. It is nearly 400 pages and should have been no more than 25 to 50. Most issues or thoughts in this book while being solid are explained in far far too painful of detail with a great deal of redundancy. This made reading the book extremely wasteful of my time.Perhaps the authors should have a ""Work Out"" on improvement of their materials."
3,A tad dated but interesting,I picked this book up in preparation for leading some discussions on Kaizen. It was interesting to get a complete picture of the way GE held such events. It is thorough (although GE-centric as you'd expect). Is there anything magical in here? Probably not. If you are looking for a more complete understanding of kaizens and other workshops this is a useful resource.
1,Very Bad Buy,This is one of the worst books I've ever purchased. The ideas in this book could be fully explained in no more than two or three pages. I bought it relying on the CV's of the authors but it turned out to be a true dud. It rehashes the same ideas over and over and over and over. It's for the braindead.
3,just go to Home Depot or Lowe's for something similar and cheaper,"I purchased this hoping it'd fit the 5 gallon bucket I had like the packet said it would. The material was too big - there's a way to cinch it but the material is still quite loose around the bucket; I wanted to pull the material up and around the bucket vs where the material currently hits, which is on the ground. The whole point was to keep things on or in the bucket, not dragging or scraping the ice. I fear the material will wear out too soon being dragged like that. I'm going to have to purchase something similar at a hardware store."
5,Fantastic,Got my package early. Leaving in the morning for icefishing this is great. Will purchase from this person again. Leaving for icefishing in the morning thank you so much
4,Pretty happy,"As described and showed up promptly. The top strap did slip on my first trip out causing the entire product and contents to fall onto the ice, but was easily fixed by using a safety pin to pin the tag end to the strap beneath it to prevent it from slipping through the buckle. Might have been my fault for filling all of the compartments, but really like freeing up the space inside the bucket so I can put fish in the bucket while still taking several rods, a couple tip-ups and a small jig box hole hopping with me without the rods getting all tangled up like they used to inside the bucket. Good product."
2,rusted badley,"I purchased this knife because it is made out of titanium and stainless. Most of the knife is made from good quality materials. The material the lock is made out of rusted badly, however. I live on an island in the pacific. The sea air is very corrosive. Even stainless steel will rust here. I consider materials of every purchase to minimize the effects of the elements.2 stars because in a normal environment, it would probably be a good knife."
5,Big Dog,"If you're looking for a big knife, this is the one. The M16 Big Dog is a high quality knife that rivals any other, from the Carson flipper to the AutoLAWKS saftey. By far the best knife I have ever owned. Rick"
5,Top Quality Knife for a mass production,"I just have a few words - a really superior knife. I have a small collection, this and the Colombia River ""Hole in One"" are my two favorite mass production knives.. both are very high quality, fast easy open, and great overall design. If this is a little out of your budget, check out the Hole In One, a great high quality cheap knife that you won't cry over if you loose it at about twenty five bucks."
2,Too vague and general,"I used this book for my programming language concepts course, and I was quite disappointed. It's just way too vague, trying to cover too many things. And few, if any, of the concepts from chaper to chapter carry through to develop a cohesive understanding. I also think most people who'd consider this book (or take a class requiring it) should have the knack to pick this stuff up pretty quickly from experimenting and perhaps a website tutorial or two.I did enjoy the chapter on axiomatic semantics, which offers a straightforward approach to proving programs and more importantly loop invariants. But that was hardly worth nearly $100."
4,Good Course textbook,I used this book as a textbook for my comparative programming languages course.The book presents the various programming paradigms without getting into the details. It is useful reading for the 3rd year computing science student by putting programming into perspective and getting into the phylosophy behind some aspects of programming.
1,Left me with more questions than answers.,"I bought this book for a course that was designed to cover general topics regarding syntax, semantics, and the process of compilation/interpretation for the variety of programming languages that exist.My issues with this book:-- The chapters don't fit together; I often feel like I am reading several books all smashed into one.-- The examples are missing depth; many examples do not have good descriptions or explanations.-- The topics need more content; most topics bring up many questions that are never answered.-- The information has no organization; I have found many definitions and explanations that are related but nowhere near each other within a chapter.-- The index is misleading; many topics do not even appear in the index and the topics that do appear don't list all of the important page number references.I wish a better book had been required for the course."
4,Good price; decent product,"Just to give you a frame of reference, I have seen these pods on sale at a local discount store called Big Lots for $1 per box, which is freaking amazing. I've also seen them at Tuesday Morning for $3 box. The Amazon price is the best one I've seen for pods not being sold in a retail store here.I bought them for my sister, who has a Melitta One:One pod coffeemaker. She said that they arrived as described, six full boxes of pods in the flavors advertised. Their manufacture dates were 2004, just like the ones she'd bought at Big Lots and that I'd seen at Tuesday Morning.According to my sister, the taste is great. She is hooked on these. For the price per cup, you can't go wrong.I just wish they didn't come from a 2004 batch. And I wish there were more flavors to choose from."
2,stale coffee,"Coffee has expiration of 2004. It is now 2008. The coffee is now going stale. I bought same coffee 2 years ago, same expiration date. It was OK back then. But not any more."
4,Past expiration date but taste OK,"I have purchased similarly dated Juan Valdez products, i.e. past expiration, but they brew fine. The individually sealed packets probably are the reason why. For the price, they provide a decent cup."
2,don't work with senseo pod coffeemaker at all,"These did not fit my senseo pod coffeemaker-basically the wrong shape and much too big. After guests forced the coffeemaker closed over these pods one too many times, not knowing any better, the coffeemaker broke! I suspect that they work fine with the same brand coffeemaker and would caution against using them with any others. Despite the date of manufacture, the pods are well sealed in foil and the flavor is fine."
3,Interesting and a little hard to follow,"I've seen some of the anime and the gashapon/figurines but the art style looks alot different in the manga. Lots and lots of boob jokes and panty shots. But no actual nudity. I think it's rated M for the language, like something you'd hear on an NC-17 movie. It is a little hard to follow, somethings seem to go too fast and dialouge can be weird. All in all I will probably get the next volume. Oh and there is an alternate cover that looks like a bad photoshop job and not as enticing as the one pictured in the description."
5,Ikki Tousen in easy to carry manga!,"During the era of the Three Kingdoms in China many heroes tried to unite the land and failed. Their spirits came to rest in jewels, called Magatamas, which fills their owners with the lust for battle. They fight to become Ikki Tousen : One Warrior with the Power of one Thousand.Hakufu Sonsaku, a busty, beautiful girl is one such student and this manga follows her as she enters a new school and the new world of wild combat and weird rules.After seeing the anime I had to see the manga. Pretty much covers the first few episodes of the anime (or the anime is based on the first volume of the manga). DOES have a nice sidestory and comments from the author. So if you have the anime, you don't need this unless you get it used or really are a fan of the artwork. Hubba-hubba!"
3,Flawless Art,"I'm a manga artist, and I bought this book for the sole purpose of having a visual resource of busty female action scenes. The art in this series is consistent and masterfully executed. It also displays an extremely effective use of foreshortening.However, the story is terribly confusing and hard to follow. I have up to book 6 and I still don't understand what's going on.But if you just want it for the artwork, it's well worth it."
1,Horrible re-write,"I have no idea if the original dialogue was good or not (I cannot read Japanese), but the ""adaptation"" by Keith Griffin is beyond horrible. Every character talks in a near incomprehensible slang and curses constantly. I have no problem with cursing mind you, but there is a difference between cursing when the situation warrants it, and saying F**K just because you can. Supposedly Keith Griffin is well known in the comics world, but I think Tokyopop made a big mistake hiring him. His work on Battle Royale was bad but still readable, this is just plain bad. I literally flung the book down in disgust. Please Tokyopop, fire this F**KER before he F**KS up any more books."
3,Good but not the best quality,"I recently purchased this guitar and while it looks good and sounds nice the quality leaves more to be desired. I don't know much about guitars, but I brought it to take lessons and my teacher said that it isn't very good. He mentioned the neck isn't reinforced and will warp faster. He also said that the tuning keys gears should be covered in the back to keep out dust, but they aren't. There was also mention of the knobs on the head where the strings connect missing a nut on them so one of the ones on my guitar has a space between it and the head. If you plan on upgrading in the future this could be a good guitar to start out with, but it wouldn't be great for a long haul."
2,UTTER JUNK,"My daughter had this thing for less than a month, her strings will not stay tuned, they break and the tuning knobs slip. I cannot return it becuase it was too late, so I am stuck with a peice of junk that nobody can use. I will NEVER buy this brand again! I shoulda just stuck with my instincts and went to Walmart"
1,Crap-ola,Guitar was crap-ola. Was not tunable. Even put high end strings on it and still was un-tunable. Seller refunded money no problem though.
3,guitar,"The company sent us the wrong color, the case ripped in several places within a couple weeks. It was also already scratched in a couple places when we got it along with missing a part. Overall, I don't think we would order from this company again."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Item received is not the item pictured. What I received was a cheap Chinese knock-off of the original strainer (pictured) that came with my sink. The hole placement is different, the pull is different, the metal is thin and arrived already dented. All this and this strainer which ""fits all sinks"" doesn't even fit my Watts brand sink. Guess I'll return this and try again with another listing."
4,"More Cards, Tougher AI Opponents...","This game boasts more cards than any Yu-Gi-Oh GBA game before it. That's a plus. Cards are gotten from packs mirroing the actual game card packs. Another plus. The AI opponents are much tougher than previously (ie. you need more than a beat-down deck to handle everyone). Another plus. You can store ""recipes"" for 60 decks. A huge plus. The only thing that takes the game down one star for me is the graphics on the gameboard/layout. The one used on Duel Academy and other games was much easier on the eyes. Still, a great game. Get it if you love playing Yu-Gi-Oh!"
5,The best Yugioh video game.,"1) It has the largest card pool2) The opponent's are smart and there are plenty of them3) You can duel in plenty of modes4) The game will last a long time5) You can multiplay on it6) You can duel your own decks7) Great deck editing systemBUT... This is only for people who know how to play. This game gives no tutorial. Other than that, this is a great game and better than those other mediocre Yugioh games"
5,Just Wow,I heard of this game and wanted to get my first Yu-Gi-Oh game so I saved my money and bought it. I waited anxiously for a few days than it came in the mail and i took it out and booted it up on my ds. i had never played yugioh before but I got the hang of it and i loved it. there are only 2 special animations for exodia and for final countdown. There are tons of cards and i have about 27 decks and they have good strategic cards. i would recommend this for any even the slightest yugioh fan once you learn it is an awesome game
5,Best Game played in my first year of gamer life,"This game blew my mind when i got and i didn't even have it yet. Graphics are not good but wow, the game is WOW!!!"
4,Great Game though a little buggy,Bought this game YEARS after it was released. Undoubtedly the best YGO game on GBA. But a few bugs in the challenges mode :o(
2,"so, so game...",not as good as the 2007 championship game! But it rounds my yugioh collection of games.
5,the greatest yugioh game ever,it features 2000 cards more then any yugioh game to date i have to duel monsters and thats a plus for me!!!!!!!! i hate dueling the characters from the show. anyway one thing you should know about this game there is a glitch in the game that doesnt let you comeplete one of the theme duels so beware!!!!!!!!!!
4,Portuguese Concise Dictionary,"I've been using this dictionary for about 6 months and have found it invaluable in my communications with friends in Brasil. It's very rare that a word cannot be found, or its meaning be off the mark. It's even rather up-to-date with common technical terms. I agree with other reviews that the quality of the binding is poor. I'm not hard on the book and already the binding is breaking apart in two or three places. Although it's not a grammar study book, some of the basic verb conjugations are given in a list in the front of the book. Every dictionary editor seems to have their own proprietary scheme of showing how a word should be pronounced. It always takes a bit of study to figure this out with a new dictionary. This book is no exception. All in all, I think it's an excellent resource and I recommend it highly. I'm even going to take a copy to Brasil with me as a gift to my friend there who wants to improve her English."
4,A Great Start,"A great dictionary but like most Portuguese reference books, it is behind its French and Spanish counterparts. True to its cover, it does have a lot of contemporary words and meanings. It's easy to use but lacks the grammar sections the Harper Collins Spanish and French Concise dictionaries have. My dicionary fell apart at the binding too. The adhesive isn't very durable. I also wonder why the English-Portuguese section comes first while in the Harper Collins Spanish and French dictionaries the Spanish-English and French-English sections come first respectively. This dictionary is worth the money but future editions should be better."
4,Excellent content: poor binding,"I have found the dictionary to be excellent. But the dictionary's binding quickly began to fail. Also, at my college a class was using the dictionary and they all fell apart so it wasn't just mine that was defective. I still use my copy even though it must now be in about twenty pieces and held together by an elastic band. I wish a hard cover edition was available."
2,"Great layout, colors about the same as each other","It is very hard to tell the black from the red on this layout. Not sure if it's a fluke and the rest are as colorful as the one pictured, but will be contacting Amazon to find out about exchanging.Will update this after receiving another."
3,it works but...,this isnt the same layout it advertiseshowever the layout is similarcertain outside bets are placed differentlyand to me just looks lower quality than the one it showsjust a warning before you buy
1,not my cup of tea,I find this book dreadfully boring and outdated. My kids didn't like it either. The rhymes are almost unintelligible and unimaginative. Sounds like I'm in the minority opinion though.
1,false advertising - now corrected,"The photo online clearly shows the Professional Grade Permacell gaffer tape -- the only gaffer tape worth using -- which is a great product. What they actually SENT was the lower grade P-665 gaffer tape, which isn't worth the shipping cost, much less the full pro grade price they charged.Added note: hey! They changed the photo to the actual product! I guess this review thing actually works. ""Pro Gaff"" is still a rotten product: tough to get off the roll, leaves residue, etc. But at least it's no-longer a bait-and-switch (updated 6-5-2009)."
4,A Great Read!,This book was very interesting and kept me reading it until I could finish it. I love Ms. Neff's writing style and her accurate descriptions of places. This book quelled all of the doubts that I'd had about it initially. Wonderful job!
2,i'm missing something,"i've had this book for years and never read it. i tried to read it once before, but couldn't get into it so a few months ago i decided to read it again. i was confused and i couldn't get into it, so i had to put it down and read something else. i don't think i'll be trying to read it again."
1,I don't buy this.,"I can sum this all up for you with one simple fact: Bart Sibrel is living proof that he himself is a liar. Because, if the US government really was anywhere near as corrupted as Mr. Sibrel would have you believe and if he really did have the proof that would be required to expose a conspiracy of this level, as he claims that he does, then he simply would not be alive today. He would have been ""taken out"" a long time ago by government assassins. And he certainly would not be allowed to sell any of his atrocious DVDs on the open market. Bart Sibrel is a con-artist, plain and simple, and not a very good one at that. The main content of his films is property of NASA and like all NASA materials they are already in the public domain, i.e. you can watch them for free. If you're American your taxes have already paid for these videos. Bart is asking you to buy something that you already own! If you're smart you won't waste your money on this scam."
1,Rado ceramic ovation,"This watch sucks!!!!I bought one of those for my wife on her birthday and the rim surrounding the glass shield broke into small pieces when it just fell down the floor.. around 4 feets high!!Warranty didnt cover that and they asked me to pay $160 for the broken part!I bought this watch so expensive and didn't expect it to be this fragile, specially when the seller told me it was scratch proof.Right now I refuse to pay that much money on such a bad quality built. I can get a fake rado for a fraction of that repair price and it wont break that easily!I seriously dont know what i was paying for when I paid 1700$ for this piece of junk, even if it looks so nice.Don't buy it!! Keep away! Just look for another model if you insist on buying a Rado."
2,Great monitor but intermittently noisy,Very happy with the features and quailty for a less than brand name item. Unfortunately I will be returning mine because of a intermittent and reasonably loud screeching noise. Was not worth the zoo at CompUSA just after midnight on Black Friday since the rebates are the only thing making it a good deal.
4,Good value,"Had one dead pixel and the speakers are fair at best, but the picture and text reproduction is great."
3,Straight Facts,"This book probably does present many valid points. However, I must point out that James Garner did NOT have a heart attack - ever. In a routine examination he was discovered to have an aortic aneurysm and only then was he found to need the bypass surgery as well. His doctors blamed both conditions on his many years of smoking.Whether you feel beef is a health threat or not, to be credible you must keep your facts straight."
3,"Great game, but hard to see on the GBA","If you love the arcade game, or the console game, this is more of it. For those who don't, the game is simple, and very addictive. The idea is to shoot a bubble (or a ball) whatever you want to call it. A cluster of three of the same color pops them, and removes them. Any bubbles that are hanging off the popped bubbles also fall, and give you extra points. The goal is to clear the screen. With two players, the competition gets fierce. Any extra bubbles that you manage to remove is used to penalize your opponent. I also recommend reading the reviews for Bust-a-Move for the playstation. The GameBoy Adavance has general problems the display, (primarily with the fact that it's display is not backlit or anything). This game in particular is difficult to see, because the game has colors too similar to see with out good lighting. So, if I were you, I'd play this on a playstation instead."
2,Play area too small,"I had a lot of expections when I ordered the game. However, it turned out a little disappointing. The play area is too small, while there is plenty of screen space left on the sides. Also, sometimes the colors of the balls are difficult to tell. It's quite a strain on the eyes when you're playing it."
3,Just like Snood!,"This game is fun, but if you already have Snood, I wouldn't buy it. It's exactly the same game - except with different characters and graphics. The graphics in Bust a Move are nicer to look at than in Snood, but the object of the game and game play are almost identical. If you already have one, don't buy the other."
3,Only rent this game,"I know in all that someone might of said something about this but this game is really hard to see. In an arcade or another game system version of this game, u can see the line to where your ball will shoot. The color is bad and u can barely eee it. The colors of the blue and green balls look similar. Other than that, this game is fun...but dont buy it."
5,hahah patricia,"hahahahah...patricia, that's awesome! to each his own. to AM! fans who wanna mellow out, this album is very nice."
2,Not the Collection I Expected,"This is not the same album as the cassette tape entitled ""Ray Charles Greatest Hits, vol. 2,"" which I was trying to replace. Very disappointing, as the best songs are not there."
2,Not the best I have had,"First off, it was too big but I tried to wear anyhow. Didn't feel the magnets were helping as in other magnetic knee braces I am wearing and have worn. Considering the item, I did not return."
2,It could be better.,THe author gets too much inside the story and that don't let you get into the period that is describing.
2,Chicago May or May Not,"This book is a real disappointment. It is unfocussed, disjointed, unstructured, incoherent and rambling. At junctures Ms. O'Faolain intersperses stream of consciousness associations about her own family members and her own thoughts and doings. You just want to say, ""What?!"" The tale of Chicago May could have been summed up neatly and completely in a short biography."
3,Disappointing,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this book is ""unfocused, disjointed, unstructured, incoherent, and rambling."" It was difficult reading and difficult to keep up with what is fact and what is the author's interjections.Also, I did not care for the personal family information from Ms. O'Faolain. In my opinion, it only added to the adjectives mentioned above and to the book's boring length that could have been more interesting if it were not so lenghtly."
2,The Story of Chicago May,I was disappointed in the book. It had more biography of the author than the subject.
3,sent to a friend,I know that the order arrived promptly as my happy girlfriend called me to say thanks....but I honestly do not know in what condition....so therefore only giving 3 stars...which is really unfair but you MUST choose a rating...
4,"process based research and biography ,Yes!","I heartily disagree with the previous review. Nuala O'Faolain is not seeking to merely recreate a biography in this book, but to urge readers to consider and ruminate upon the lives of women on the fringes of society, those millions who have led hard-scrabble, often brutal, lives throughout history. Her commentary seems, to me, not to be intrusive, but rather chronicles the connections made between the lives of the author and the subject. O'Faolain examines what might be universal themes, tying May to her family, to herself, to the reader, to the world. If one only wants to know about Chicago May, in the way we might examine her at a historical museum, this may not be the book for that person, but for those who wonder about how women fall into infamous and terrible situations, how history is rewritten, and what the realistic brutalities of early twentieth century life were--this book will give those readers a lot to think over."
3,Only good because it's Nuala's voice,"The only thing I liked about this book is that it's written in Nuala's voice. Otherwise, it's not nearly up to the quality of her other work."
2,Where's the bibliography?,"This book is an odd hybrid of what appears to be the author's obsession with Irishness and Chicago May because she was Irish, and a re-telling of May's biography, with corrections here and there as needed.It makes for interesting reading, mostly, although I'm more interested in May's story than how the author feels about it - her interest seems naive and rather pathetic.The lack of bibliography is concerning. Where do the facts and figures come from that have no attribution within the text? ""A newspaper report"" is hardly an attribution at all, and when she says ""In one baking hot week in the summer of 1893, 607 children under the age of 12 died in Manhattan tenements,"" are we just supposed to take her word for it?Too many things appear to be made up of whole cloth, conjecture, and the author's not very imaginative musings.Skip it."
3,"Good Eyepiece, but can't use filters","Close inspection of the threads on the eyepiece revealed no damage, however non of my filters (orion, baader) will screw on to the threads. I own a number of other Celestron eyepieces, and all of my filters fit them just fine.The eyepiece itself is very nice. Wide fov, and good eye relief. Just forget about using a filter with it."
4,Complete insight information on how it all works,A very complete book covers all the topics that are related to the reproductive system. I've been searching for this kind of book a long time because it is not your basic story book reading. At last not the standard material which you will find in all the popular books. This book gives you all the details and the background you need to fully comprehend this system. It took me some time to understand all the matters that are addressed to. If you want some story telling book without a good comprehension of the deeper material don't buy this book. If you really want to know how it works I really would recommend this book.
2,Ugh!,"What a complete waste of time. If you just have to see what this volume has to offer, save your hard earned money and get it from the library.As other reviewers have noted, it only has info on the 50 states and a few Canadian provinces. Not only that, but after reviewing cities listed that I have lived in or spent much time in, there was incorrect and misleading info. I wouldn't dare trust this as reference.Do yourself a favor and just get a guidebook to the location and check out the local websites as well."
1,Too many errors,"This is a great idea for a book... but it'll only work if the information is accurate. I found numerous mistakes in the section on Canada. Some information was outdated (by years!); some other things were just plain wrong. According to one of the maps, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia now sit on an isolated island. That's news to me! If this is indicative of the research done by the authors, I would be wary of using any of the information in the book.I would say that if you want to use ""Writer's Guide to Places,"" use it with caution. Decide on the setting for your story and use this book as a starting point... but do LOTS more research yourself before you start to write."
2,Could have just gotten place info on the internet,"The book is well organized, but doesn't contain any information I can't get by googling. I get the impression the author hasn't been to most of the places listed within either, there's no ""inside information"" you couldn't find out easily on the internet. Good idea that needs to be fleshed out a lot more to be useful. Sorry I spent money on it."
5,loved it,"I live on a farm and that is why I picked this pattern. I thought it was adorable and classy. I thought the quality was excellent, thick and comfy. I also loved all of the lovely accessories. Too bad its being discontinued. Glad my 3rd child got this theme in time!"
5,A Peek Behind the Green Door,"Whimsical sounding, but reads with so much insight you find yourself just sitting thinking over each short story and what is really being said. Truly wonderful."
3,EL3 does not equal EL3e,"In an attempt to save a few bucks, I got this battery as a backup for my Nikon D80. My battery says EN-EL3e so I thought, what the heck, I would take a chance. Well, no luck. This battery does not work in the D-80. (I know it doesn't say that it fits but many camera accessories don't list every model that it works with so...)The problem is on the D-80 (EN-EL3e) battery there are three contacts. One labeled (+), one labeled (-) and one labeled (s). On the sunpack battery there are only two contacts (+) & (-). The resession of the (s) on the OEM allows it to be fully inserted in the camera. The sunpack doesn't have the third ressessed spot so the battery compartment won't close. (See customer photo)I may try to modify the Sunpack battery to get it to fit in the camera but somehow, I don't think that will be a good idea. Cheers."
4,Great Book,Written in a very elementary way. It allows the non-speaker to get started learning spanish. It works very well with the accompanying CDs because you can hear how things are pronounced.Overall very satisfied with this product.
1,not received,"I havent received this book and have been waiting since June, so what should I do?Thanks for your quick reply please."
5,Very cute show!,"This is a fun and wonderful show for kids and adults alike. Incredible footage of a pine squirrel finding adventure and romance in a forest. I highly recommend this Walt Disney treasure, you will love it. Has anyone noticed that the narrator tells the story in rhyme?"
4,"Good item, but apparently a return, and incomplete","I was happy to find a genuine Bosch fuel pump to replace the factory one that failed in my Mazda Tribute. The pump appears to be of high quality, and very quiet during operation, unlike some less expensive replacement fuel pumps that are more easily found in auto parts stores. Worth waiting to have a high quality unit than being stranded by using a cheaper part for such an important part of the vehicle."
4,Good basic steering wheel,"My 10yr old loves this steering wheel. He uses it with his PS2 and Gran Tourismo 4 game. He says it's helping him learn how to drive when he gets his license! Ha! The two issues I've noted are 1) The pedals are not that durable. My son stomped his foot on the brake pedal and broke it the first day. I opened the back and glued a broken plastic holder piece in place. Then it worked fine again. 2) Got to get something to place the steering wheel on or else it will not be stable when you're using it. We used a large thick book as a table base. Overall, it works fine. My son's having fun and hasn't broken it, yet."
3,Great fun after its anchored!!,"Playstation 2 Cobra TT WheelThis is a great accessory for the new player or a more advanced player! Scary to think your kids may be picking up some bad driving habits very early on! As far as durability of the Cobra wheel it WOULD NOT stay put with just the suction cups that it came with, even with the more gentle driver. I ended up using a luggage strap to keep it anchored on top of a TV tray by going over the base just behind the steering wheel. This works great as long as I don't have to lug a suitcase anywhere soon!! Overall the whole family from a 40something down to our 12 & 7 yr old, are having alot of fun with the Cobra Wheel!!"
2,Cobra Wheel,Controls are good but base design is lacking. Suction cups will not hold controls securely to surface and will require additional restraint in order to use control effectively.
2,too much pink in the color,"While these are highly polished and nice-looking, don't buy them if you are looking for cufflinks that are truly red. Of the four colored areas, two are truly red and the other two look pink instead. Red can add a touch of class, but pink doesn't really do much for most guys' dressy accessories."
5,Best author for southern gardeners,"Felder Rushing is an outstanding writer, and I highly recommend this book for gardeners in the Deep South. His lists are invaluable when you are shopping for plants for a garden in this area."
4,Great Resource,I ordered and received this book promptly. Read through it once and it was okay.Shared it with a neighbor and then reread and valued it even more.I think this is one of those books that will prove to be a valuable and cherished resource the more I peruse it.
4,Informative and fun to read,"Much useful information, great pictures, great concept. At times it left you wanting more...especially when there were hints that something might be a little invasive, for instance!"
3,Danish Gangsters on a treasure hunt,A story within a story... the major bad guy gets all his bad friends killedlooking for the money $5 million from a blown safe off a train with drug money in it. One gangster kills another until no one is left. Or so it seemsthen the guy telling the story says... Frank is still alive.
1,Waste of money,"I was very disapointed in this game. I thought that maybe 1% of this might be fun but apparently it's [just] bad. ...This could never even dream of comparing to the best game for ps2. either agent under fire, grand theft auto 3, or gran turismo 3 is the best game"
2,STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS GAMES PATHETIC. IT IS VERY HARD AND THE SHOOTING SUCKS!anyway, u need to be a genious to know how to beat the first level. if you buy this game have a cheat codes book with you cause you're gonna need it!!!! PLEASE! DONT WASTE YER MONEY ON THIS TRASH AND SLAUGHTER YOUR BRAIN TO PIECES. you wont regret it. dont buy it!"
1,I haven't even played the game.,"I haven't even played the game ,but it had one review and a five star rating so I thought I would bring it down a little."
1,Disappointing,Bought as a gift - definitely a flop. The game is tough to start; controls are sloppy and guides are NOT user friendly... waste of money all around.
4,"I'm sorry, you said WHAT?","We like puzzle games, problem solving games, multi-player games. This looked sooo promising. And then it hung. And hung. And hung again.The advice we have received from the company is in essence ""It's not our fault. You'll have to start over from the beginning of the game, or skip levels using cheat codes"".How'd this get past quality control? Maybe they just never play-tested it..."
5,MOST UNDERATED IRISH BAND SINCE U2 IN THE 70'S,"This third record is truley amazing! Glen Hansard has joined forces for one more masterpeice with Trevor Horn on this one!!! Original, Strong, and a MUST have for any rock fan who appreciates the whole realm of recording! GOOD LUCK GLEN - YOU DESERVE THE ABSOLUTE BEST!"
5,Excellent,"One of the best albums I've heard in a long time. The songs are intelligent, sometimes challenging, and best of all, catchy. It's hard to single out one or two songs as the standouts; they are all so good. However, Plateau and Star Star are almost achingly beautiful. The Frames also know how to rock, as illustrated on The Stars Are Underground, Seven Day Mile and more. This album will just grow and grow on you: a definate Must Have."
3,Somewhere between Counting Crowes and Radiohead,"An excellent album, if a bit on the radio-friendly side. But the songs are there, and you get the feeling that if the band wasn't on a major (which they're not, anymore), they'd really make a killer indie rock record."
1,Does not work,I used this as directed. This does not work even a little bit. It does not remove semi-permanent color.
1,Contains LEAD- potentially TOXIC for your child!,"I bought two of the Melissa and Doug puzzles and decided to test them for lead before letting my 9 month old chew on the pieces. This type of puzzle came up POSITIVE FOR LEAD using Lead Check swabs! I would rethink buying one of these as lead exposure has been linked to numerous health problems. This company claims to offer safe, non-toxic toys that they rigorously test for the presence of chemicals. I was initially glad to find toys made from ""wood"" rather than the usual plastic. After finding lead in this puzzle meant for toddlers, I am appalled at how little we actually know as consumers in this country. Please do not give this puzzle to any child! Who knows how many other Melissa and Doug products contain the same materials... they have certainly lost a customer in me!"
3,Just a sticker,"Great idea, good-sized knobs, but no match for a drooling toddler. It would be more appropriate for the wood to be painted directly instead of the use of a sticker. The hand jigsaw work also means that neither the circle nor the square fit very well when turned... making it less educational... unless it's worth learning that overpriced products made with cheap labor produces poor results."
3,"Great for Toddlers, but not as well made as it should be","My son (15 months) loves the toy. The wooden knobs are big enough for him to grasp easily. The puzzle itself is made of a lightweight particle board material. The pictures are stickered onto the wood. There is alot of dust. The pieces are not all cut very well, you will have to sand down the sides of at least the circle piece.You'll have to clean it when you get it because it is full of dust. Do not let your baby put it in their mouth because it will take the sticker off. The puzzle is not painted.The circle piece is not well cut. It needs to be sanded down. My son has trouble putting it in because it doesn't fit in every orientation as it should, so I am unhappy about that which is why it is not five stars. Overall its cute and my son enjoys playing with it. I am unhappy about the quality, but I would buy it again as long as its not 15 dollars. 15 is too much for this low quality."
2,Very poor workmanship,"I like the concept of this puzzle, but it did not arrive in a condition acceptable to give to a 1 yr. old. The pieces were cut from the background with a jigsaw, and there was no sanding or cleanup whatsoever. The hardboard was chipped and rough, with sawdust and loose particles everywhere. It took about half an hour of sanding and cleaning before I felt comfortable letting my child play with it. In theory it is nice that the puzzle is ""crafted by hand"", but Melissa & Doug needs better quality control!"
4,good puzzle,I am a speech therapist for young kids and I use this puzzle alot. It's good for matching shapes and labeling them. The large knobs make it easy for the child to do on his/her own.
5,Perfect first puzzle for young learners,"This puzzle is a great first puzzle for a little one. Melissa and Doug puzzles are expensive but worth their cost because of the way the puzzles work. with a duplicate image under the puzzle piece, a child is not left trying to figure out where something goes without guidance.As a teacher for children under 3, Melissa and Doug puzzles are my favorite. I can tell the difference in the speed of learning when using these puzzles over cheaper puzzles that are not as well thought out.this puzzle is perfect for a first birthday gift. The child will learn from it and be ready for the more complicated melissa and doug puzzles before you know it!"
2,Quality Control?,"This puzzle came completely scratched and dented. I mean, did anyone look at this before sending it out? It should have been thrown in the trash not mailed to a paying customer. Buy this item in the store so that you can see the quality."
2,Mediocre Quality,"The puzzle is a hit with my 17 month old who loves the shapes and colors. However, the quality is pretty mediocre - I've attached two pictures showing how it came out of the box, with one corner already disintegrating and cracks in between all of the shapes."
1,I'm done with Melissa and Doug,"Older versions of Melissa and Doug puzzles were much better quality. This puzzle is junk. Made with a jigsaw, the shapes can only be inserted one way (and the circle only fits into the puzzle in a very specific location). Very frustrating for my little boy. The puzzle was also covered in wood shavings, and I cleaned it two or three times before using. Made in China. I'm done with this company."
2,Circle isn't circular,"The pieces are not cut out accurately enough, which means that it is difficult to fit them into the holes. The circle is particularly annoying. A circle is a circle and it should fit in the hole in any rotation, but because the piece is not cut accurately, the circle will only fit if you rotate it exactly right. This is very confusing for a child. The rectangle and oval won't fit if you turn them upside down and the square and triangle will only fit in the hole in one orientation.We have another Melissa and Doug puzzle with farm animals that doesn't have this problem."
5,"Well-made, toddler-proof chunky puzzle","This Melissa & Doug Shapes Puzzle is very well-made and toddler-proof. It has bigger, chunky handles that are perfect for a child's first experience with puzzles. The puzzle is large, and the individual pieces are simple. Perfect introduction to puzzles. The puzzle is bright, cheerful, and very sturdy. Highly recommended for toddlers."
3,Nice puzzle but the paper's already coming off,I bought this for my 18-month- old granddaughter who is learning her shapes. It's a cute puzzle and she always has an interest in it when she heads for my toy shelves. The pieces are a nice size and she likes to knock on the door (the rectangle piece) before she takes it out. The only problem I have is that some of the paper on the puzzle pieces is washing off. I always wipe the puzzles off with a barely damp cloth after my granddaughter plays with them and this puzzle doesn't seem to have a clear finish over the paper like my old Melissa & Doug puzzles.
5,Great for little hands,"We received this puzzle for our son's first birthday and he loves it. First he could just do the round piece, but now at 18 months he can do the whole puzzle. The large wooden knobs are securely attached and great for chewing. The colors are still bright and not peeling. We have since given this puzzle as a gift for two other one year olds, and have received rave reviews."
3,puzzle,I should have researched the age restrictions before I bought this for my 8 month old granddaughter. I thought this would be a nice starting puzzle and she loves it and it is fun for her however she did put a piece in her mouth and the decal stated to peal away. She dose like the puzzle and it does seem like it would be a lot of fun but I will have to put it away until she is older
5,Best Puzzle I've Seen for 14-month-old,"This puzzle was great for my 14-month-old. He started putting the circle in from the get-go and now that he is a month older (15 months) he is starting to get the square and triangle pieces in too (the oval and rectangle are harder). He also just loves holding onto the the knobs and carrying the pieces around. I love the blend of education and fun with the ""house"" design + teaching shapes. My 15-month old niece also loved it when she saw it."
5,Great puzzle! Perfect for beginners!,My daughter was delayed in her fine motor skills and this puzzle has helped her so much! She now can put almost all the shapes in independently ( except the oval- its a little tricky) and she is learning shapes and colors! I love Melissa and Doug products and this one definitely lives up to others!
3,Product damaged,I love the product but disappointed because one came all scratched up and it was a gift. I had no choice but to give it in that condition.
3,Too Tight,"The downside of handmade products is that sometimes they are imperfect. I am usually a big Melissa & Doug fan, but this puzzle came with the shapes cut a little too tight for my autistic son to get the pieces in easily. He can do it, but he gets very frustrated. I'll stick with the Chunky Wooden puzzle series from here on out."
3,ok,When I got this game I thought I was purchasing a wrestling game all this game basically feels like is like all your doing is fighting exhibition matches it has no story and the character customization is just pitiful with very little options to truly create any kind of original wrestler as like the smackdown series the graphics are pretty well done but with so little arenas and just 10 wrestlers to chose from this just dosent warrent the 60$ price unless you have to get a wrestling game and the fighting system is very easy to pick up and play in about 10 minutes or little you might master this game decent game just not worth the steep price tag
5,yes i know....,"i know this game gets shallow reviews, lets face it, it is a game for guys and i am a guy. but seriously there are alot of people giving this game bad reviews strictly because of the control difference between ps2 and xbox 360. it has very good graphics and i think, gameplay but alot of people should also check the box for age rating. it says rated M for a reson. dont get me wrong, it is suggestive, but thier NOT naked people. if your a guy you will like this game. just dont expect to much and like it for its novolty value, a laugh. there noty real girls and this game has gotten harsh reviews because of the ""vitual girl"" factor. if you dont like it dont buy it its that simple. but dont give it a bad review becase everyone elses says its bad. decide for your self. i give it 5 stars FOR FUN NOT THE GIRLS!!!!. but yes they do look a little hot."
1,Doesn't work on EU consoles,"Doesn't work on EU consoles, Doesn't work on EU consoles, Doesn't work on EU consoles I'm stuck with a sexy game in a box!"
4,rumble roses xx,i think this game would have been better if they would have had a story mode. like in the first rumble roses for playstation 2. but i thought that the girls looked good. backgrounds could have been tweaked a little better.
2,This Should Be PG-13 Instead of Double X's,"I am a fan of the first Rumble Roses mainly because I did not take it seriously and I used to watch G.L.O.W (Glamorous Ladies Of Wrestling for you youngsters) but this 360 game did not make any improvements from the last worth paying more than 20 bucks for. Namely the content isn't pushing the envelope so to speak. There are episodes of Benny Hill that are more ""mature"" than this game. If you are going to make a game designed for ""mature"" themes at least make it mature and not some contrived DOA rip-off. Second the only way to unlock outfits is to keep playing match after dull and uninspired match. Using the same moves from the first title. Save your money folks!"
2,far from been next gen game,"This game is a joke. The graphfics are less than avarage,the controllers suck, I became champian three times,played the game for 9 hrs unlocked one custome and then you have to buy it.this was my first game from Konami and last."
2,Outdated,"With recommendations to get your employees beepers and a computer, I find this book outdated and not very useful in today's world."
2,Webster's third new international dictionary of the English Language,"The contents are as expected, but the condition of the books, even though I expected ""Used"", was not up to my expectations. The spine of one edition is split away and the other copies should have been cleaned up a bit. The packing was probably a main reason that the spine was ""off""...the three books were thrown in a box that had about 1/3 the amount of peanuts needed. Too bad...I will have to do some much needed repair."
5,NightWay,"From the ancient ways of Arizona's Navaho Nation to the new ranch wealth of the great Southwest, two warring sons fought for one woman's love"
2,Not Good!,"The cable will not charge lg vx8600, after long negotiation the seller admitted as such, but would not reply to arrange a refund.Product misadvertised, works well for data but doesn't charge phone.Seller does not communicate well. Watch out!"
1,BART SIBREL'S BEST WORK SO FAR ! ! !,"This has to be Bart Sibrel's best work so far... NOT !!!I won't waste your precious time with listing all of the faults, discrepancies, misinterpretations, or outright lies contained in this so-called ""documentary"".However, I will list all of its good points for all to see :1.2.3.etc.I believe that you get my point ...Anyone gullible enough to think that BART SIBREL, a Nashville, TN Taxi-Cab driver, has either the education, the experience, the knowledge, or the access to valid sources of information regarding either the NASA Apollo Moon Landings or access to the Apollo Astronauts themselves, deserves to waste their money on this video.Do yourself a favor . . . Put the money in your gas tank instead !"
1,Terrible sound and poor picture quality,"As the other two reviewers of this new DVD issue have said this is a truly awful DVD in terms of sound and picture quality. The orchestra and voices are constantly shifting in volume and clarity; the picture has waves running down it much of the time and changes hue and texture constantly. Toward the end (if you make it that far) the picture and sound quality do seem to improve or become steadier. Quite a shame since the production is interesting and convincing. The singing as recorded is sometimes too loud and forced, the clapping can be overbearing, but Miller has thought through his idea of a Little Italy Rigoletto with ingenuity and power."
2,Not Ms. Chesney's best.,I love Ms. Chesney's books for light summer reading but this one just did not quite click for me. The characters did not seem to develop truly and the ending was very stilted.
4,Courage Under Fire,"One of the most attractive things about this film was the character of the father, whose display of chutzpah was often very funny. One gets the impression that most Jews submitted their necks to the butcher's knife without a struggle, but he never gave up. He created forged papers which deceived the Russians, made an ""artificial arm"" which took in the local Nazis, and when he and his family and friends were discovered by a German soldier, he plied the German with alcohol, got him completely drunk and dumped him in a railway wagon. His most important deception, however, was playing a recording of Imre Rose to persuade his family and Jewish guests that the singer was still alive; thus he gave them hope."
2,Written from the sidelines by a guy who wasn't INSIDE>,"While mildly amusing, there was little in the way of meat in this book. The author was located at either the New York or London office for almost the entire life of the magazine and only met with senior management on a few occasions.For him to have written a book about the Industry Standard is like me writing a book about [a store] because I shop here.If you can pick it up used, it might be worth a quick read but you will find yourself skipping pages because the details have little to do with the company and more to do with James explaining his job while there."
3,Watching a publishing disaster an ocean away,"At one point in this readable, frank book about the rise and fall of the dot-com business newsweekly The Industry Standard, author James Ledbetter cites a definition of ""reporting"" as something you do when you don't already know what to say. In this case, Ledbetter should have known that he didn't have enough to say and done more reporting. He worked for the magazine through what he describes as The Fat Year and until its demise just a year later. But he worked in New York and London while the headquarters of the publication was in San Francisco. So what we learn about the Industry Standard is what he could see from across the Atlantic or across the continent. The result is that the reader is starved for a lot more inside information. Luckily for the reader, Ledbetter experienced a lot in London that we can imagine duplicated what was going on in San Francisco. The book rings true but a bit hollow."
5,The pefect Summer shoe,"You will want to spend your entire summer in a pair of these once you take the plunge! The most anatomical shoe ever and works throughout the seasons, though obviously not good on wet days or in really bad weather. You can wear socks or go ""commando"", the choice is yours!"
2,Negative experience,"After wearing the Betula Birkenstocks for about an hour, the snap button kept coming undone near the buckle. Happened pretty much every 10 minutes when i walked. Midwest wont take them back since i wore them."
4,Very Comfortable But Has a Marking Sole,"I use these Betulas as a pair of slippers in the house, and they are really comfortable. I've had them for about 6 months. From what I gather, Birkenstock makes the cork supporting footbed which gives the support and comfort; Betula does the rest.I rate them very highly for their comfort and looks, but unfortunately the soles tend to leave black marks on our tiled and laminated-wood floors when I shuffle my feet. The marks are easily washed away, but it's disappointing that it doesn't have a non-marking sole. Also the buckles on my pair have a silver coating that is now wearing off.Great comfort at a great price, but it's not perfect."
4,Birkenstock Suede Clog,"Love the clogs, the sizing chart was not helpful, ordered the wrong size, waiting for exchanges."
5,Great Clogs!,"I am so pleased with these shoes. I can't tell you how much. Not only were they comfortable to wear, they were very affordable. Shipping was quick and easy."
3,I've read better.,"I really love the Black Lace series. I stumbled on to it a few years ago and have never looked back. I must say I was disapointed in this book. I had to force myself to read to the end. The book had an interesting premise-a mother who was reaching the prime of her sexual experiences and a daughter who was basically discovering hers. Unfortunately, the book did not catch my attention and frequently lost it."
2,OK so what did you really expect ....,"It took me a while to get my hands on this book and the title, I must admit, intrigued me.The book starts out with a great flourish as our 50'ish mother meets up with daughter's boyfriend in the hallway during a sleepover. Well mom sure knows what she likes and certainly isn't shy about putting her fingers on it either.The daughter on the other hand likes her sex, hides her kinkiness and. hey, as a young and beautifull girl is bale to give it to any guy she wants as long as he doesn't ask for it .....I guess I would have enjoyed the book more if the author would have spent more time on some of the delicious erotic sitautions that were set at the beginning of the story, but we quickly discover that both mother and daughter aren't really much more than licentious sluts anyway ...."
3,Great price and good packaging. Arrived quickly.,"Though I loved the samples in the magazines, when the actual perfume arrived, I thought it smelled a bit too masculine for me. But the seller was great!"
2,Battery leak,"Bought the Jato 3.3 for my son, 15 years of age. The car is very fast and he could handleit easily. The problem came after the first days use. The servo batteries were dead. Upon inspectionI saw that they were leaking from the ends of the batteries. We cleaned it up and replace the 4 AA batteriesand ran again the next day. When we were done I checked the batteries again. The same problem, theyhad burst and were leaking. After calling the tech line, I was given a few questionable reasons for this happening.Bottom line, nothing should cause something like this. I replaced the AA holder with the 5 cell battery upgrade.This seems to work fine, no leaking. They should eliminate the cheap 4 battery holder and supply the betterbattery pack. Making something cheap and expecting a customer to upgrade to the good parts is bull!When this car is gone, I will never buy from this company again. Put some pride in what you make!"
5,full score!,"My daughter has enjoyed performing in the Nutcracker, and has enjoyed listening to this full musical score of the ballet. Well done!"
4,Nice CD,"I am not a ballet or opera enthusiast by any means, but I enjoyed these cd's for what I bought them for. I bought them to familiarize myself and my 6 yr old daughter with the music before we attend a Joffrey performance of The Nutcracker tomorrow. The CD's have served their purpose, and the music IS pretty. Didn't give it 5 stars only because I don't think we will listen to it for any other purpose, perhaps we will listen to it a little bit each year during the holiday season but other than that, not sure if we will really get our $$ worth. But that is an individual preference, others may get a lot of use out it!!"
2,pool hose,"I can not believe I just paid $25.00 including shipping for 1 hose. I just went to walmart and can get a whole kit( two hose, clamps) for $12.00. The sad thing is I live in Corona, CA and the product came from Redlands, CA. The shipping was $12.00. The actual cost to ship this is about $6.00.Very UNHAPPY"
3,Lost in translation?,"Flavia Bujor is a good author althogh she seemed to rush through the book. There are obvious places where she could of added more detailed, but seemed to leave out some. Especialy when she describes feelings. Over all the book has a good plot, but the lack of deatail quickly made me lose interest. I would recomend this book to any one 14 or younger, any one older than that will have a hard time relating to the characters. I hope this was helpful to you."
3,As Simplistic as early Rock n' Roll,"I went for this one on the strength of Greil Marcus's recommendation. It sure-footedly sketches in the rise and rise of the rock industry, the death of payola,and the cynical power mongers who controlled and shaped the industry. But is a very wooden piece of story-telling, and the author has only a standard understanding of language and rudimentary plotting to paint his picture. That is, it has more than a whiff of managerial lingo and much less the dramatic shading and pulse of music. Be that as it may, it's a story with sufficient gravity to pull me to the emmergence of the Fab Four and Bob's nasally folk days."
3,promising... is about the best thing I can say...,"I picked this up because there's a huge David Mitchell blurb on the front cover... and I love David Mitchell and don't think I've ever seen him blurb another novel... so I had to pick it up and was extremely let down... Jeffrey Moore does have potential, though... his characters are interesting and its obvious that he's creative and has writing talent... but what bothered me about the book was that it relies on characters' disabilities and oddness too much... I never felt like they were real people... they lacked substance..."
2,Started this and didn't finish,I started this book but didn't finish because I didn't like the foul language and all the sexual content.
1,Outdated pamphlet; disappointing,"I was very disappointed to find this was a pamphlet. The cover was made from a color ink printer, and the typed material with drawings was inserted and stapled.The information was very limited and outdated. The shipping information made it sound like copies were hard to find and were thus grounds for a surcharge (extra profit)."
4,Groove your plane for straighter shots!,"My pro suggested that I get a Medicus 7 iron to assist in grooving my swing plane and finding my own personal swing rhythm & tempo. I am able to practice my swing inside - no ball needed! In correcting my swing plane issues, I now have more confidence in my swing and hit the ball straighter and further. I can't ask more than that! This product is well worth the $$$ I spent on it."
4,any golf help will help,its definatly letting me know how messed up my swing has become and it is making me slow down and not bat at the golf ball-but since I am a new golfer I may need help using this correctly too.
4,Billy Graham is up to par.,"I always liked Billy Graham. Fervent, but not overly fanatical. He's the genuine article. I really liked his book. It's definitely worth the read, even if he is a bit fervent in what he believes. He's passionate even in his old age. I also recommend Peter Cayce's book, ""What Did Jesus Really Say -- What To Say To A Born Again Christian, But Never Had The Information (Author: Peter Cayce). I loved this book! I've been telling everyone about it. Here's a link:What Did Jesus Really Say-How Christianity Went Astray: [What To Say To A Born Again Christian Fundamentalist, But Never Had The Information] -- by Peter Cayce"
3,OK but..,"I've read better. You're better off reading, 'isbn: 1576832538' it's much better. 'HTBBA has some strong moments but I wouldn't pass it on."
4,Great game for a 6-year-old,"Woody Woodpecker: Escape from Buzz Buzzard Park for PS2:I couldn't believe how quickly my daughter took to this game -- her first PS2 experience. She now regularly shows ME how it's done and I am a lousy player by comparison. The game never stops challenging her and while there is a bit of violence, it's of the cartoonish type. Woody's sensibility as a character is funny (as in the way he surveys new scenes, or spontaneously dances on occasion). The 3D graphics are really impressive, as is the intuitive nature of your ability to see from Woody's perspective. A great, well-crafted game."
3,An adecuate game for kids,"[It] is a game for kids. The graphics are good and the gameplay is intuitive. I have agree that there are a few things to fix, but is nice for kids and teens. (...)"
5,Probably My Favorite Rhymesayers Album,"This album came out over 10 years ago, but if I had to pick one, this would still probably be my single favorite album put out by Rhymesayers.Features Musab, Desdamona, Brother Ali, and One Man Army (of Binary Star) on writing and vocals.Features production by Ant, Brother Ali (yes, producing), Vitamin D (on to produce for Abstract Rude, i self devine, etc.), Jake One (on to produce for 50 Cent, De La Soul, and many others), and Big Jess (you know him if you're from the TC--come on).Funky, upbeat, different, raw but polished--seriously what more do I have to tell you about this album?"
4,Overall a very good supplement to the Red Book,Mark has a very good way of describing how things work. I have been using OpenGL for while but not using XWindows extensions that much. This book helped a lot and I used it to make sense of some the convoluted text in other books for the wgl functions.
4,Definitive for 1996,"Back when I was learning GL, this book was the best. It covered the basics at a good level of detail. Almost as if Mark could read our product requirements, it also has appendecies on off-topic-to-GL-but-not-to-us topics, such as the X input extension and graphics overlays.I believe GLX has gone through a few revisions since this book last had a new edition. Therefore some of its data may end up referencing deprecated old glx functions instead of the slick new method. In particular I'm thinking I saw something about visual selection changing. That's the only reason I'm holding back on star number 5."
3,Good beginners book but no realworld examples,This book gets you up and running fast with OpenGL and X but it fails to point out how to do specific tasks. I didn't know how to use Xlib until I got this book. The examples are kinda flakey as they don't translate well to realworld programming. A ball bouncing in a box would have been a great example. Would somone please write a cross platform OpenGL manual insted of these platform specific books!!!
2,Only for an advanced Programmer.,Book talks mostly in theory. Very few complete examples. Compile errors on the example programs. Assumes you have broad knowledge before it begins.
4,Great for Evangelical Families,"Written to be used with Christian children encountering mainstream (Brighamite) Mormonism.This is a great book for Evangelical families. It requires careful parental guidance if used by members of any Christian denomination that has the Apostolic Succession and the priesthood; that is: Episcopal Church, Catholic Churches, Eastern Orthodox Churches, Oriental Orthodox Churches, Anglican Church, Assyrian Church of the East, Armenian Apostolic Church.My wife and children are Orthodox Christians, I'm Roman Catholic, and another family member is Episcopalian. So, I used the book with my eight-year-old in this way:1) We skipped the page on the ""priesthood""2) I emphasized the role Tradition and Sacred Scripture both play in Catholic and Orthodox theology:2 Thessalonians 2:15-17Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle."
1,Horrible,"Never needed the book for the class except assigned note-taking. It's a crappy book anyway - banter only useful for a 5th grader. Pretentious and uninteresting, it offers no real insight, and is a waste of time and money. I pity the trees that were cut down to make this trash."
1,Everyone already knows about the sites in this book!,"Anyone who has been surfing the Internet for more than one year will know about all of the sites in this book. The book is a good idea, but it falls very short."
1,Useful for Only the Very Novice Internet User,"This book was a huge disappointment, but what should I have expected for less than $9.00? Instead of listing two sites for 300 only sometimes useful categories, the book should have gone even a little bit more in depth on fewer categories. But then they'd have to change the title--it apparently was more important to have 300 categories than a useful book."
5,This book has excellent variety!,"Ken Leebow has done what everybody wished, took time to search the net and organize it in a way that is fun, and easy! It offers great sites including educational, productive, and funny! Buy this book, you will not regret it."
2,"Worth your buy, but exceptionally flawed","Why is it that a book with so much potential crashes? Ken Leebow did a good job finding 300 good websites, 50 of which are actually worth going too. Ultimately though this book suffers from a lack of organization that other 300 incredible things to do have. No table of contents, no sub sections, nothing, you could be searching for hours until you find something you want to look at. Plus with search engines that are highly developed these days, what is a book about internet stuff good for?Also his synopsis of the sites are sometimes wasted, he tries to fit jokes in, most of which are ..., he tries to make a pun, they don't really fit. Also the cartoons aren't that fun either, they may give you a small smile but mostly it's just more wasted space.Fortunately this book has enough quantity to make it worth buying, but don't be fooled, this book is flawed to the core, really, really, flawed."
4,A great book-full of great sites and fun to browse!,This is a fun book with alot of good info on very useful sites. It makes a good gift!
5,wrought iron 6 arm candle chandelier.,"It makes any room elegant. wow. That is what I said when I first hung it and think that every day I look at it! Wonderful price, and very sturdy!"
1,Wow this was bad,"I watched this on Amazon Prime, so at least I didn't waste any money on it, but I did waste a few hours watching it. I just kept thinking it would get better so I hung in until the end. It did not get any better. Horrible acting and cheesy dialogue. The soundtrack was probably the worst part - it was distracting and never seemed to fit the mood of the scene. The house and countryside where it was filmed were beautiful, but that's about the only compliment I can give it. Don't waste your time with this one."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A heavy gravity world man falls in with a bunch of spaceraiders, these sort of physical advantages are handy in that line of work.When he has a disagreement with them they are also handy when running away.No-one at all likes you then, pretty much. Not the best situation to be in. Good for readers of the book, though.2.5 out of 5"
3,Classic sci-fi,"As a teen I loved the Starwolf trilogy, and as an adult come back to it with nostalgia but also renewed appreciation. A great premise, well written with amusing characters and clever plots. I wish he had written more, would love to know if Chane ever became a ""nice little Earthling""."
3,fun but confusing,"This is a hilarious game with quirky characters and an entertaining story. The Tim Burton-esque character designs may not appeal to everyone, but I find they add to the game's charm. This is, of course, pretty old, so compared to recent games the graphics are lacking and the controls and screen layout can seem quite clunky at times. On top of this, the conveyance isn't great; it can be hard to figure out where to go next in the story."
4,One of the better RPG's for PS2,"I was pleasantly surprised when I picked this game up. I really did not know what to expect from this game for the ... price tag it had. It was a great game with a good style of playing. It took some getting used to because it does have a unique battle system that allows you to have everyone attack one foe at once or even have them attack a different foe all at once. The previous reviews describe the game well, so I will skip that part. The only reason I give the game 4 stars rather than 5 is that I felt that the game played too quickly (It took me roughly 35 hours to go through the game). If you are a diehard rpg fan then I say give this game a try. It gives you a break from all the serious rpgs out there."
1,Like having teeth pulled...though not quite as fun...,"This video game stank. RPGs are generally plot/story-driven. The plot on this story fizzled quickly. The relationships between characters were not really developed. Given how linear the play was, they could have taken some time to add something interesting. In the end, I was playing just so I could be done, hoping that there was some fantastic ending. Turns out the final boss was easier than other bosses and the ending sequence was just boring. Save your money!"
1,Just Read the Review,"To tell you the truth, this is one of those games with OK graphics (they really aren't trying very hard to amaze you, anyway), which actually don't bother me. Storyline's okay, gameplay and controls are good, but the game just isn't fun. It doesn't have any bad qualities really, it just fails horribly to entertain me. I don't like it, but I recomend it anyway."
1,Not much here,"This was a very poor excuse for a RPG. It would probably be fun for a 2 year old. The music is bad, and storyline is worse. Rent before you buy it."
2,Dan The RPG man.,"You shouldn't have to be patient and wait for a game to get better. The playstation2 to this point is the most awful RPG system I have ever played. I miss the playstation already. This game is acceptable has a ""cute"" story but not an epic by any means, good rpg for newbies and kids."
1,*Blue Back!* aka CD-Rom,"I Ordered this game,Promp Delivery!(2-3 Days).Then I opend it & put it in.Low a Behold it was a ""Blue Back"" aka Cd-Rom. My PS2 Never plays ""Blue Backs"",along with Hundreds if not thousands of other Folks!,(check the Web!).DVD Format Work Great!,any and all Silver backs are Fine!.Problem is You never know 'till it's opend!.Most Places won't take them back!,Or will let you exachange it for another!(Like,What good does that Do?). With all that Said,I never Played it! ;-("
4,^_^Best tale I've heard in a while!!,"Okage is one of the cutest games I've played in a while! I'm 10 years old and I bought the game Okage for $10.00 at a used game store. The plot to the story is the best! It has EVERYTHING! Comedy, Drama, and yes, even SOME gushy parts. Yes, I must admit that the dungeons aren't that well planned out like Zelda or Final Fantasy, but this game has it's own spice and originality to it! I love it lots! Espacially some of the artsy characters like Stan and Ari. Even though the puzzles and dungeons aren't much, if you like an easy breeze through fun game that has a colorful plot, pretty scenes, and graphics this is definetely the game for you. Especially those people like me who hate getting stuck on really really hard puzzles and dungeons, this game is REALLY for you. **My words of wisdom passed to you, hope you enjoy, toodle-oo**"
5,Quite out of the ordinary,"I went to EB Games and looking at some new games I wished to buy and when I went up to the counter to purchase this game the employee said he thought it was a game. Buying it for only $8.99 I took the chance! This game has an excellent plot... Their is a family (Grandmother, Grandfather, Father, Mother. Annie, and her older brother. Well Annie is put under a curse by a ghost (she can only speak pig latin) And then King Stan and servant James maggically appear at the house offering tio lift the curse in exchange for ""evil servants""! And she is lifted of the curse and Evil Stan takes over the older brother's shadow. you play as the older brother... and the fun continues! In addition to the great plot the gameplay and graphics are awesome."
2,Takes patience...,"This game has it's ups and downs. The plot in this game is fairly original. It takes bits from different stories, and it becomes something new. And, I love the comedy in this game. For example, there is a rivalry between two of the characters for control of Ari, which is amusing. There is also flirting, which you take part in if you choose. And some of the characters are fairly interesting. But, the dungeons are terrible. They're repetitive, you just beat urns and things a lot of the time to move on. Plus, you're under attack constantly outside of cities. And since the combat is boring, it's an excruciating experience overall. But the cut scenes are fun and you get to choose what to say many times throughout the game. I think the plot being revealed is worth the torture the rest of the time. You should probably rent Okage and check it out before buying it."
2,Sub-par RPG...,"This is a sub-par RPG for any system, especially for PS2. Graphics are reminiscent of first-generation PS2 games, as is the sound. Control of the charcacter is average, and menu screens are not as intuitive as other RPGs. Although the premise of the story line sounds cool at first, the plot line turns out to be thin. One other thing that really bugged me was that the gameplay was really easy and you progressed through the game quickly, but earning money was slow and tedious. Just a warning: rent it before you buy it."
5,excellent,ONLY ONE THING I CAN SAY.I ACCIDENTALLY BROKE ONE LENSE YESTERDAY AND DESPERATELY SEARCHING FOR NEW PAIR.I WON'T CHANGE MY SERENGETTI VEDI 6820 POLARIZED FOR ANYTHING.
3,Crazy Pricing,You can buy this for about $7 at B&N or other sites. Or you can pay $40 for it here. Your choice!
3,Good but took to long to get to the point,"The dvd consists of 3 stories in one. The first one dragged on too much before getting to the point, which was about how the skeleton and bones hold up the body. I actually thought they'd packed the wrong dvd at first. But the rest of the dvd was very informative for my 2 kids."
4,Mine and my Son's review on the movie,"For my part, I truly enjoyed re-watching it. I thought it was entertaining and informative. As a child I loved the episodes and had in fact watched a couple of the ones on this disc, which helped me decide to purchase it. Also I liked it enough that I was willing to submit to hours, days, months of re-watching this episode since my four year old loves the magic school bus and watches them over and over again.On my son's behalf, he enjoyed it and did watch it a few time (I lost count) but I noticed that he didn't enjoy this video as much as some of the others. In some of the other magic school bus DVD's he became completely involved in the action (laughing out loud or sitting on the edge of his seat), but in this one he wasn't as involved and am hoping it will respark his interest when he get a little older."
2,Lukewarm,"I don't know why this film was made. The people who made it obviously don't like Lovecraft much. I mean, if you can't stand the man, why bother? It doesn't really adequately deal with his writing, other than present it as the product of a pretty horrible person. H.P. had his faults, but he was also capable of change and quite frankly, I think the biggest criticism of him can be that he was immature. Much of the racism was posturing and in the end, he married a jewish woman. Although they were divorced, her belief system or ethnic origin was not the cause. The movie feels more like character assasination than a true and objective look into his life."
1,RUN AWAY! RUN AWAY!!!,"UGH!What a complete waste of time.This ""documentary"" is a pretentious piece of unmitigated dreck.AVOID THIS DVD AT ALL COSTS!!!"
3,very colorful and very wrinkly,These napkins will brighten your dinner table but be sure you are prepared to iron them after every wash.
2,Colors were disappointing,"I bought these napkins for their fun colors, but they look a lot better in the picture than in person."
5,BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL,"THESE NAPKINS ARE GENEROUSLY SIZED, VERY BRIGHT AND CHEERFUL, AND A GOOD DEAL. I LIKE PRIMARY COLORS IN GENERAL, AND ESPECIALLY IN MY KITCHEN. PASTELS HAVE ALWAYS SEEMED A LITTLE BLAH. IN ANY CASE, THESE ARE ANYTHING BUT BLAH. I LIKE EM."
2,Sorry I bought them,"I was fooled by a review saying they looked OK without ironing. They look awful! Steaming won't do it--they have to be sprinkled. I thought I was through with all that, and believe me I'm not that picky,"
4,Essentials of Inventory Management,I've worked in Inventory Management for 20 years. This book covers a lot of areas that someone new to this field will find useful. This book even gave me some new ideas to try in my consulting firm.
3,exhibit 2-7 K Factor Example,"the example provided for determining the carrying costs for 2 years seem to be over stated. In the example the additonal carrying cost of the items that have not moved in two years seems to include the Item cost for each year twice. It shows $ 4,449 that has accumulated after two years. This is should show $ 2,528. Only the Carrying cost should be added for each year to come to the additional carrying cost. The author seems to have included the cost of the items in each year. This will affect the breakeven days."
4,Sensational and refreshing album!,"This album brings us the best memories of Fogerty in his successful period with the Credence Clearwater Revival . What a sincere country ballads , filled with charm , humor and expressiveness , specially Everymen , Champagne love , The legend of Alcatraz, Joyful resurrection , Mistery train , and I love youI guess you will share so nice and great moments with your closed friends with this superb album ."
2,Not much help for the banking-impaired,"If you know nothing about money and banking, then skip this book! This book works well for people who are already in the banking business and is familiar with the terms and definitions of the money and banking world. I ended up buying the actual textbook to study and understand how to pass this Test. If you're in the banking world, then go for the book. If you're starting out as clueless as I am, don't bother....get the actual textbook and study that instead. Or better yet, ask the advisor if you can take a different test."
1,"To find out what to use to pass this test, READ!","I read the entire study guide, I even typed out all the correct answers and studied this outline for 3 days straight. I also looked up any definition I couldn't find in this study guide in one of Mishkin's money and banking textbooks and still ended up with a 48 (fail).This book is OK, but is really only worth about 15-20 questions in the actual test. Go ahead and procure a Financial Institutions Teacher guide, one with all the sample test banks in order to be more successful on this test.DO NOT USE THIS BOOK ONLY OR YOU WILL FAIL."
3,"Haven't actually seen this, but....","...why do these usually good movies, I'm assuming they are the originals, have a pictue of Fredo Corleone on the cover? I'm giving it three stars because they are good movies besides the strange cover 'art'."
3,Reasonable cookbook,"This cookbook has some interesting recipes which are not particularly hard to make (like all vegetarian recipes, tends to use lots of ingredients). My main complaint is that it's not particularly authentic and is more an Americanized-vegetarian version of Mexican. If you want authentic, I think you need to keep looking."
2,No pumpkin in the Pumpkin-Rum Rice Pudding,"The back cover of the book lists several titles of sample recipes, such as the Pumpkin-Rum Rice Pudding. So I looked up the recipe in the cookbook. Although the side note on page 149 writes, ""Canned pumpkin brings a taste of autumn to this savory rice pudding treat,"" there is no pumpkin in the list of ingredients! and it is not mentioned in the recipe steps either! This is poor editing of a cookbook and makes me wonder whether other recipes in the cookbook have the complete list of ingredients and right amounts... Also, if you are used to GOOD authentic Mexican food, the recipes won't satisfy your cravings."
3,Not the best but better than the rest!,"Definitely helped me get started on a few basic ones. Some salsa tips are great. I had a hard time finding some of the ingredients though. All said and done, it's a good value for money."
1,Not nearly as fast as they claim.,"I hate to say this because I usually really like VT recipes and cookbooks, but this one let me down. After trying several of the relatively time consuming recipes, I had to admitt that I really didn't like what I was eating. The food just did not taste good. In the end, I gave up. When I want Mexican food, I know a great vegetarian-friendly place in the Village."
2,SDXC as a Windows7 card purchased from Amazon,"I have a MacBook Air running Lion. Some of the programs I need to use for work require using Windows. To save space on my Mac, I loaded VMWare and Windows onto this 64GB card. Unfortunately, it did not work on my system. The best guess as to ""why not?"" was that the card was too slow. I ended up using an external USB hard disk which does work. This may not reflect on the SanDisk Ultra as this was a abnormal use of it.Buying this card from Amazon was quite easy and fast. I will continue to use Amazon for purchases like this in the future."
5,"just for photos, no videos","Just bought it, for photos works fine, great storage capacity but not fast enough for videos. I can only record in 640x480, more than this the camera stops to record"
4,Great,Put this in my new camera I got for Christmas. Have no complaints what so ever. Works great. Lots of memory space.
5,It's 32 GB...,"Well, don't know what else to say. Bought this for my kids' VTech Tablets (max storage is 32 GB). It works."
1,Warning! Not necessarily what you want.,"I ordered this because I need an HC memory, as described. BUT, I received an XC memory and it is not compatible with my devices. XC may be better memory but it doesn't work for me. Also, note that the photo is XC memory."
5,review,"The product was right on time and with the same detail specs as mentioned,I would really recommend this product,worth it:)"
1,Bad batch?,"After the first one didn't work in a Canon 60D, it was exchanged for another which Amazon was kind to do. This one has only lasted a year and not used that much. Unhappy that a $ 77.88 SD card lasted only a year."
1,no show,It has been 3 weeks and my package has not arrived. i am sure my ratting will change if i get my order.
5,Great SD Card for the Raspberry Pi,I use this 16GB Sandisk SD card for my Raspberry Pi mini computer. This is a long lasting SD Card that will last for years to come.
5,What's not to like,It works like it's supposed to.It works like it's supposed to.It works like it's supposed to.so there.
4,Canoeing The Adirondacks with Nessmuck,A great piece of Adirondack history of a time long past. Very enjoyable read by George Washington Sears (Nessmuck)an outdoor writer of a past age. Paddlers especially will enjoy this.
3,Knight Chess Piece,Bought this for a friend for Christmas. Although the cord was very durable the actual chess piece was not. She wore it constantly and never took it off. It lasted for about 3 months before the hook connecting the charm to the cord broke. I'm assuming it broke from too much wear and tear since she works in a daycare.On the upside it was very detailed despite its small size. Not sure if I would buy it again or not but I might since my friend really liked wearing it.
2,Not concise,"The whole technique is based on raising one shoulder and lowering the other. Why is this book so thick? I gave it a low rating because of this. All the other chapters are just filler, for instance a review of all the places the author have been snowboarding...show-off. Boring."
1,Warning ! Vulgar language and a relentless focus on Zen and Metaphysics,"After reading the entire book (except for the sections focusing on Zen and Metaphysics), here is my evaluation of the snowboarding portions of the book: This book could have been a winner, but unfortunately the author distracts and distorts his snowboard knowledge with unnecessary vulgar language and continual illusions to eastern religion. The author has a lot of snowboard experience and knowledge, but the vulgar language, the focus on Zen and the constant striving with mainstream snowboarding distract from learning the established terminology and techniques of snowboarding."
1,A bit misleading,"I haven't yet read the book, but wanted to respond to the promo blurb that states that the instructors organization (AASI) says you will fall in a lesson. It does not. I am a AASI trained and certified snowboard instructor and can confirm that instructor training and certification programs all focus on empowering instructors to teach ""slam free"" snowboard lessons. It has been a very big focus in all of the instructor training programs I have participated in (after all, who wants to fall hard while on vacation?)I can understand the desire to position the book as a unique resource, but I'm afraid the publisher overstates the case (far overstates) that this approach is unique to the author. No-Fall methodologies are employed pretty much across the board in the USA.I do look forward to reading the book--but the overstatement does make me wary."
4,Surprisingly Helpful!,"I was forced to read this book for my graduate studies and I found it surprisingly helpful. By filling out a basic personality inventory, this book will tell you what ""style"" of worker you are and then how to deal with people of other ""styles."" I see this book being a hit with sales people who have to interact with many other people everyday. But I can also see how this book could provide a foundation for learning how to work with other people in any environment. If you are willing to make slight modifications to your personal behavior, this book gives you the skills to build great relationships. I agree, however, with the previous reviewer's comments that this book does not go very deep, thus only 4 stars. Do not expect to change your boss into a nice guy just by reading this, but you can make your day-to-day dealings with him more enjoyable using these tactics. (This is also an easy read... Took me 2 days!)"
4,Clear and Concise Information You Can Use,"I took a webinar based on this book and found the information presented intriguing enough to buy the book. It's a short read but filled with good, practical information. If there are certain people in your lives who rub you the wrong way, understanding how their style differs from yours could help to improve communication and make the relationship more effective and pleasant for both. This book was definitely worth reading and I've experienced benefits from it at work in a very short time."
3,"Good ideas, but ...","This book has good ideas for improving relationships and awareness about your own style with people. But it's poorly written and plods over the same points over and over. If you're good at skimming, you can read this and extract the valuable content then blow over the 4x rehash. If not, it'll be tough to exit the second chapter."
5,People Styles at Work,"All participants in a supervisory workshop that I conduct receive this book. It is perfect, especially the appendix section of the book, for employees who want to better their work and personal relationships and be able to influence. The key is flexibility, not your style, to have more effective interactions. Vilma Colon, Transition Matters, Inc."
2,A bit gaudy,"The Treville kitchen island chandelier is certainly unique, it is solid, with fair craftsmanship. The picture on the website is deceiving though; individuals should read the dimensions carefully. This light fixture is also very ""bulky"" which makes it heavy; therefore, your delivery charges could be very expensive if shipping to far territories. The chandelier is best suited for a very large kitchen, with a very high ceiling and an Island that is at least twice the length and width of this fixture. It has that true Tuscan look, but could be considered gaudy."
2,misleading information,I wanted phillips head screws for applying deck boards to my dock. The advertisement stated these screws could be used on all outdoor projects including docks. When I received the screws the box had a statement that these screws should not ne used on docks. Fortunately Amazon allowed me to return them.
5,Very good process for accomplishing the goal,"This book provides coping mechanisms if you are stuck in the pain of unrequited love, loss of a spouse/child/significant other. Take from this book those ideas which help you, evaluate the others and disregard if necessary....ie) I disregarded the title and the section on ridicule.I didn't want to 'fall out of love' with my child; I needed help coping with the loss and putting it into perspective. This book gave me some easy skills to practice. They didn't remove the pain, but they definitely took the edge off it. Some losses are just too painful to totally remove."
2,Perhaps not my style of book,"I just received this book in the mail, and upon browsing through it, it seems a little too ""mean"" for me. I don't want to HATE the person I'm trying to get over or be repulsed by the thought of him. That's just not me."
4,Falling Out of Love,"This book was quite practical. It teaches several techniques for overcoming constant thinking about the person you're trying to fall out of love with. One strategy aimed at trying to eradicate flashbacks of intimate moments is quite full-on but, I suspect, very effective in intractible cases. Well worth the read!"
5,Helped me,This book helped me a great deal with my own relationship problems. I also reccomend Confusing Love with Obsession by John D. Moore
2,Okay...,"Not as helpful as you may think, but all in all not a terrible book. Perhaps better suited for certain situations rather than anyone who has gone though a break up."
2,Clinical to say the least,"I think this book has a heart that is in the right place, but I just couldn't get on board with some of the messages (see review below me!).I did find a forum online that was very helpful to me and an ebook that helped me to deal with my breakup. I recommendThe BreakUp Workbook as well as their forum to help you deal with a man that has wrecked you!"
1,BLAH,"I didnt find this helpful at all. Infact it was pretty mean. Also, it was kind of boring to read."
5,Deshi,"I found this martial arts thriller to be an excellent blend of realistic martial arts,likeable recurrent characters and an exciting story line. As a black belt and Ph.D. myself, I appreciated Donohue's attention to martial details without being exaggerative in content (no flying throgh the air or destroying opponents with five fingers of death). I also read Tengu, his third novel, and throughly enjoyed it. I highly recommend the entire series."
3,Deeper than Sensei but not as Well Realized,"Donohue can write. Sensei is one of my favorite thrillers.Donohue suffers a bit of a sophmore slump in ""Deshi"". It is still a good book and fun read, but not to the standards set by ""Sensei"". It drags a bit in the middle and the images are not as clear.This seems to be a transition book. Donohue appears to be moving in a more mystical direction and the book suffers from that. His writing style is very clear and precise, if I could write I'd like to write like Donohue. I am sure his gift came after a lot of hard work, but like a great figure skater he makes his work seem effortless and beautiful. The mystical direction in this book does not match his style as well as the clean action in the previous book.If this had been Eisler's only book I probably would have rated it higher but I was expecting more from this gifted writer.A fun read and recommended."
2,Decent if clumsy writing,"The author has a decent touch with action sequences (few though they are in this book). And he seems to have a real affinity for martial arts which comes across in his writing and enriches his story. But he is very akward at moving the plot forward and constantly depends on groups of characters sitting around dicussion what happened. ""Why did this clue appear earlier? What is the significance of this event? What trends should we see based on events so far."" Very clumsy style which veers into Hardy Boys book territory. But when he finishes explaining everything that's happended so far he writes competently. If you got the book free and like the genre it's worth reading on a plane."
3,"Story Line is ""Stretched"" Thin","Sorry to say that I cannot report that this second of three books by John Donohue is a vast improvement over his first book ""Sensei."" The character, Connor Burke, is stretched to the limit, along with an unbelievable plot. Both Burke and his Sensei are far too naive, so much so that the story line is unbelievable. Still, this is fiction! And it is mostly an enjoyable read. But the author does not reach his potential until his third book ""Tengu: The Mountain Goblin,"" published in 2008 by YMAA. Read it and see for yourself!"
3,Good...for the price,"Deshi was an ok book it didn't quite reach the level of Mr. Donohue's first book ''Sensei'' I felt that Deshi sort lacked that wonderful tension building and climax that sensei had. As well the characters seemed to aimlessly sort of ramble about in the book not quite capable of doing their jobs. Donohue writes well as usual and I truly enjoyed the fight scenes, but then again they seemed quite short and yes, even though this is a mystery/detective series I felt that a little more focus could have been given to that. I give it 3.5 stars and will buy his next for sure."
2,Bored to Tears,"The only people who should read this book are the stuffy academics the main character belittles, as this reads more like a lecture than a piece of interesting prose. There is little sense of suspense or danger in his fight scenes. Donohues' martial technique descriptions don't live up to his reputation as someone well-versed in a variety of Asian martial arts. Save for his relationships to master and his brother, there is very little in the way of interesting character interactions, and the conclusion is anti-climactic at best. Even the detective aspect to the story barely held my attention. If you're someone looking for a story rich with martial arts content this book will disappoint you."
5,The Complete Reference for JNCIP Lab,This is the only and comprehensive JNCIP lab preparation book available today.The book is well written and covers complete coverage of JNCIP lab.If you understand this book you are good for the actual Lab.
1,A very biased viewpoint,"I bought this book with the anticipation that it would give a reasoned and systematic approach to the works and accomplishments of the Designer Moschino. It turns out to be a very biased book, which in no way depicts the true lack of ability this designer has in his marketing of patterned jeans. I would not reccomend this book to anyone who wants a true reasoned account of Moschino's creations, depicting the true nature and quality of his so called works of art."
3,Entertaining if Not Reliable,"My original copy (lost when loaned) had about twenty major corrections I had made in the margins. The mistakes were particularly annoying when directions were given 180 degrees wrong (e.g., 'turn left' should be 'turn right'). I don't know how many people are still wandering around in the backcountry trying to find their way out, as a result of these misdirections. The author, not being from the area he wrote about, garbled a good deal of the local lore, as well. Still, Gagnon depicted his own trail-packing with affection and enthusiasm, which made the book entertaining; and we locals did enjoy picking at all the flubs and gung-ho advice.The book is out of print (published thirty years ago in 1974) and I'm now looking forward to replacing (and re-editing) another copy while I can still enjoy the hiking and the frequent adventure of finding my way out of forest despite Gagnon's goofy directions."
5,"The most comfortable, most durable shoe I've ever owned","I bought a pair of these slip-on mocs at a Filene's back in 2004 and have worn them just about everyday since. I'm one of those genetic mutants whose big toe curls upward and most of my used shoes develop a hole at the big toe after several months. Not these. Not only are they comfortable, they are stylish enough to wear just about any time. I've taken them on nine-mile hikes through the mud. I've worn them with dress pants.The leather has started to dry out and fade, and I like these so much I located another exact pair to replace them! Please note that Clark's makes two versions of this shoe. The one I own, No. 36596, is the department store quality version, retailing for $89.99. There is an ""outlet quality"" version (not sure of the No.), which I tried on a couple of years ago at a Clark's outlet, that is not nearly as sturdy. I'm not sure what version Amazon is selling."
5,Men's Clarks,I want to tell you all my son-in-law loved his shoe's and the best thing is that i got them half the price of what other's wanted for them. I would buy more for him from Amazon if he needs them. Order them and in 2 days they was here.
4,Great pair of shoes,The shoes look real good to start with.As for comfort - the only shoes that I counted on till now have been Nike. With all others I use gel soles - but not with Clarks; had ordered another pair (Men's Mercury Oxford) of Clarks; so am certain that I was not just lucky with this pair; they do make good shoes.Looks like my first choice of formal/semi-formal from now on will be Clarks.
1,Bad quality,"You got what you paid for. This shoes' quality is very poor. If you really want to try Clarks brand, go to their local stores. You will find the shoes are much better over there."
2,"Good item, but package open and resealed with tape.....","The trooper looks good and all, but i like collecting items and if i buy a new item i expect it to be fabric sealed and NOT open and resealed with dutch tape, because thats simply sloppy work."
5,Super Scorch,Commander Scorch is awesome! He is one of the most rare figures in the world. He should be. I can't wait to get my hands on him. I love his accessories. He comes with a backpack and a legpack.
2,Not Very Good,This figure is very hard to get and when you do get it it's not very good! The legs do not move good and the the body is heavy so it falls all the time. But the guy looks cool. he has a removable backpack and a thing on his leg.
4,One cat loves it.,One of my cats loves this toy. She sleeps in it and plays inside and out many times during the day. Her Bizzy balls are inside and I hear the rattling even from other rooms. The very large cat is a little leary of going inside; I think he worries about getting stuck.It's nicely portable and can be moved out of the middle of the floor when company comes.
2,Cat not interested....,"Cat really had no interest in this. If that changes I'll revise the review later.Cats never act finicky then change their mind, do they...???I've given it two-stars because it makes a nice place to throw all the cat toys and easily carry them around.Oh and by the way, got one (one cube) at Walgreen's for $4.99 so this is overpriced, imho..."
5,My kittens have almost destroyed this! They love it!!!,"They knock it over and like popping out of the holes that are on the sides, except they're actually on the top after they knock it over. They lie in wait for each other because they can see through the red fabric. This thing gets moved all over the house because they love sliding in it. One kitten likes to get under it and run around with it on his back. They also like chasing a feather teaser through the holes. Really fun stuff!"
5,The best cat toy EVER -- Hours of enjoyment,"My two cats run around, in, and out of these two tent-like cubes. They are incredibly durable -- they bounce back into shape even when the cats tackle each other on top of them. The two tent-material cubes attach to each other by 4 velcro strips provided.The cats hide, sleep and play inside. They take their other toys inside and dash in and out of them for hours!These are by far the best cat toys ever. I got them last August (and it's now April) and the cats have not tired of them at all. By now, the kitties have torn two holes through the sides of of cube, but they still work.I sit and laugh as they flip the tents around so one of the round holes faces up, and then they jump through the top hole. So fun to watch.They also fold easily for storage."
5,Shy kitty refuge,"Best kitty toy (for the price) of the season. Both of mine love playing with/in/around the cubes. My shy ex-feral can defend her territory when she choses, and spends a LOT of time being queen of the castle."
1,"Great toy, but rips","My cat loves this toy, but twice I bought it and twice it ripped after only a day or two at the black piping and the wire shows. It is not sturdy. Too bad because it is so much fun!"
2,Not for my cat and my friend's cat,"I heard a good thing about this item from one of my friend. So, I decided to buy it. But my cat didn't play with the cubes at all. Then I gave out to my friend who has a cat and it also didn't get attention from my friend's cat."
1,My Nephew Likes This Old Rubbish,"My blind nephew is always looking for some obscure rubbish and he wanted me to order this rubbish for him and it's crap. Shirelles only has one good song and he bought the whole CD for one good song. At least he likes the CD alot. He likes this obscure crud because he has an expancive taste in music. He needs to listen to more artists from the 60's, 70's and the 80's that have more than just one hit. Shirelles are one hit wonders, but in Butler for Jake, every single song he likes."
5,the Shirelles - 25 All-time Greatest Hits,"One of the top Girl Groups. My favorite song ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?"""
2,Great tracks--bad sound,"This collection of the Shirelles (25 All-Time Greatest Hits) really is comprehensive, but the sound is disappointing. Even cranked up, the fidelity just isn't there. --BW"
5,Excellent Compilation -- All Fans Will Appreciate It!,"This is at heart a singles collection, one that contains all the hits (From ""Dedicated To The One I Love"", ""I Met Him On A Sunday"" and ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow"" to ""Soldier Boy"" and ""Baby, It's You"") plus lesser-known gems such as the sublime ""A Thing Of The Past"" (my favourite Shirelles song...and lead singer Shirley Owens's as well) and the swaying ""Maybe Tonight"".The great majority of these cuts were issued as singles, that's how strong the material is. All are presented in their original versions and are digitally remastered, with the majority of the tracks appearing in stereo (""Baby, It's You"" is presented both in mono and in stereo; as I'm a fan of wide stereo, it was nice to hear the difference). The sound is impeccable, the selection is nice (but where's ""Blue Holiday""? Licensing issues?), and the price is just right. Highly recommended."
4,Let's Hear It For The Girls!,"My sister who is three years my senior is solely responsible for my love of the ""oldies"". I always wanted to be just like her and so her music became my music. The Shirelles were her favorite girl group and I have had a good time digging up CD's for her . We both really loved hearing the music and singing along with it . It bought back so many memories (we are in our 50's) and our grandchildren are singing the songs with us . The are great songs to sing and hear again. We were especially thrilled to hear ""Pretty Words"" and ""What a Sweet Thing That Was"". Then we realized that ""Blue Holiday"" was missing and my search has not produced it. As it doesnot appear on any of the collections I suspect there is a licensing issue. Too Bad. We are still happy to hear this and other old favorites and we especially like that the little ones like it also. One more thing to help bring the generations closer."
4,Likin' the Ninjas!,"This is actually for our son's 6th birthday, later this Summer. It isn't ""educational"" in the sense that it teaches him anything, but it does foster imagination and creative play, which we feel is important. We bought him all 4 Ninjas at a super price, thinking that we could interact with him or there would be enough for 3 friends to play with him as well. They also seem sturdy enough to ""play"" outside in the backyard on the big play set (swings, slides, rock wall, club house...) this Summer, but I'll have to amend my review if they fall apart or something!"
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,Needed this type of blade for some projects and this gritted carbide blade fit the bill. I am upgrading my tools and this is exactly what I needed.
4,AVAILABILITY,I AM NOW ADVISED BY MR. JACKSON'S ASSISTANT THAT THIS VOLUME IS TEMPORARILY OUT OF STOCK AND NO REPRINT DATE HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED AS YET. (6/10/00)
2,Great content - Very Poor Quality,"The text is difficult to read, and is smudged in some places making it impossible to read. The index markers are not consistent in any way. Some have a tiny font size while others are much larger. In fact the fonts throughout the entire book vary in ways that defy logic. Some change in the middle of a sentence!While the book contains much valuable information, this edition is of such poor quality I would recommend buying a different version, if it exists. I am extremely dissapointed in mine."
3,Not for everyone,"I bought this book for a reason. This is not a reading book it nor it can teach you homeopathy. It wont help you become a homeopath. If you have experience in homeopathy or doing some 2 or 4 years course in Homeopathy. This is the book for you. It will help you to choose the remedy. Basically this book is a list of all possible symptoms and for each symptom their are more than one homeopathy medicine. It may sound tempting but by just buying this book you may never be able to find the correct remedy. The first step (I didnt take this advice seriously) is to read and understand the art and science of taking homeopathic cases understanding words like Rubric, Modalities work with more experienced homeopath. Master the technique of understanding and individualizing the symptoms; then we are talking. I wish someone had given this info before..."
5,Very good book on Lane's tricks and philosophy,This is a very good book on how Billy Lane makes his bikes. There are some things in the book that make me cringe like Billy drilling a hole in metal while holding a metal plate in his lap. But he does lay out in detail about how he sets up the bikes he makes and his philospohy on building bikes. The is not a handbook to make a book just like Billy Lane but a pretty through overview of what he does.
3,Bellow expectations,"That's the beauty of online shopping, must of the time you don't see it before you buy it. The book is nice, but that's all. It has a lot of Billy's ego, but the tips I was expecting from a chopper builder like him were not in the book. I looks like a transcription of a OCC show and I really expected more. Not that I wanted a step-by-step book on ""how to build a chopper"" since I have already build my own without this kind of help, but I really expected those TIPS that only a guy like Billy could give."
4,building a bobber,This book has been very helpful. Illustrations were good and fabrication tips were useful. Well written and easy to follow procedures; good blueprint for the project.
5,Loved It,"I thought there was good info and tips in this book. There are lots of good, clear pictures. I recommend it!"
1,Give me a break,"Unbelievable. If you're some girly boy or have a crush on ""Billy"" I'm guessing you'll be impressed. If you make your living with tools you'll have wasted your money."
4,This shampoo does more than clean!,"I had been using Pantene Pro-V for color-treated hair and was fairly pleased with it, but I decided to try Dove's shampoo for my lightened/highlighted hair one day. I have been using it ever since! My hair not only is clean and shiny, but it has actually gotten thicker! The results hae been amazing, and I get compliments on my hair all the time -- even from hair stylists! My hair tends to tangle, and I get static electricity even in the summer, so I also use Dove's advance color conditioner on a daily basis, and it is also fantastic! I love my hair now (at age 56) more than I ever did when I was younger. It's so inexpensive, too! Maybe my diet and vitamins also help, but I really have healthy hair, and I credit this shampoo for a large part of it!"
4,The Theory of Negativity,"Peter Steele is God and Type O Negative are the Prophets of Doom!!!! Awesome band, and a great glimse at one of their shows. A must have for anyone who is seriously into this band. Buy two and give one to a friend... It's the gift that keeps on giving! This band is better than Xanax and a helluva lot cheaper than therapy! Think black!"
3,Cool concept - lousy quality images,"Not much to say beyond the title of the review. It's a pretty cool and functional item, but the images/video, even at high res, are just above the level of crap."
2,Wish it would work in cold weather,"I have yet to get this camera to record below about 40 degrees. When I turn on video record mode, it turns itself off almost immediately, presumably because of low battery power. I makes great recordings in my living room, but not outside. Hopefully it will be better in the summer."
3,"Works well, could be a better product though.","This camera is very simple to use and its minimalism is a strength. However the low resolution and frame rate at maximum resolution as well as lack of support for higher capacity SD cards (>1gb) limits it's appeal. Its also useless in low light situations. If it supported 640x480 @ 30fps and supported 2gb SD cards, it would be a five star camera."
4,oregon helmet cam,"cam in nice and lightweight, nice to have sd card so can change at will, batteries could last a bit longer though"
1,This camera doesnt work correctly,"This camera doesnt work correctly, it films during 30 seconds and then stops, for begin again is necesary to remove the batteries and insert it again and then the camera films 30 seconds more.I consulted with amazon about this problem and the answer was that the camera works with lithiun battery, then I used this kind of batteries in my camera, but its work is the same, worked 30 seconds more.I need to solve this situations, I think that my money is lost."
3,The Count of Monte Cristo adapted by Mitsu Yamamoto,"I just received this edition and am disappointed to find out that Mitsu Yamamoto is not the illustrator, but the adaptor of this work, and that it is also an extremely abridged edition. While it may be very good reading, I was expecting to receive an unabridged edition."
2,Cute but NOT worth the money...,"And it is cheap so that is not saying much! I got this for my daughter and it is SO loud even she dislikes it. You can not even hear yourself sing along and again...the background music is too loud!!! Not worth returning and my daughter just uses it and pretend to sing into it! Could have given her a pink stick for that matter but it is kinda cute on the outside so when the batteries burn out...I doubt we will replace them. I am sure ( HOPE ) there are better, more workable, fun microphones toys out there for kids!? I will be looking..."
4,"The first book on the breed, a must for any fancier.","The three versions of this book (original red cover, second edition blue cover and last green/grey cover) are all out-of-print and highly prized by basenji fanciers. Some of the only exsisting photographs of original imports/first generation dogs are within its pages. Really not the book to get if you are researching to pick a dog (you'd want Susan Coe's book for that) but a true piece of Basenji history to be treasured for its frankness and those elusive early photographs."
1,very disappointed,Poor choice and just 50 minutes of content on DVD. I am very dissatisfied and disappointed with the offer on DVD even though I am fan of David Garrett
5,.........terrific product!,"This is a great product which I have repeatedly ordered from this seller, arriving in less time than they stated. I had previously used a different brand and very expensive clorella, which I did get great benefits from. So, I was hesitant to switch, but glad I did because the benefits continue and I have saved a lot of money making the switch."
5,Hetty Forever!,"BBC mysteries in general and Hetty in particular are always more than wonderful to this anglophile.I will continue to acquire them .The evry day lives of the British working class in retirement is a bonus, aside from the cases being investigated.Those cases are refreshing in their general lack of violence and gore.Can Patricia Routledge do anything wrong?"
2,Not that good,I usually enjoy a mystery. I always enjoyed Patrica Routledge on Keeping Up Appearances. Smehow the two do not go together. I just did not enjoy this enough to buy it again.
2,"Great book, *IF* it's your first Brian Tracy book","Yup, I agree with a lot of the other reviewers. I haven't read his 'old' books, but several of his works in the last few years all have a tendency to recycle the same thing. Again, if it's your first Brian Tracy book, you'll probably benefit---which is why I gave it a 2 star, not a 1. (it's strikingly similar to his previous book ""Create your Future"")But I suppose thats business.....if you build it, they will come..."
1,"Different book, same content","I've been a big fan of Brian's work, but this book simply rehashes stuff he's written before and tosses in quotes from other people that have been over-used.If this is your first Brian Tracy book, you'll be fine. But as someone who has bought all his prior tapes and books, I feel ripped off.Zero-based thinking, ""I like myself"", and ""What would you do if you knew you could not fail?"" have made appearances in the past and it's great stuff. But why does he feel the need to feed it to us again and again?I wish I would have read this on the bookstand instead of pre-ordering it. I could have saved myself some time."
5,Just the Facts!,"This book may come across as somewhat dry and lacking in excitement, but that's why its worthwhile. Its not a shallow ra ra motivational book. Its an excellent, clearly written distillation of all the common ""self-help"" advice you'll find in a broad range of other books. This shouldn't be the only book of this genre you should read, but it does complement those that are more passionate and inspirational quite nicely."
4,"A practical, easy-to-use guide to implementing positive thinking","The power of positive thinking is highly touted in both personal growth and business management circles. But enthusiasts often use fuzzy language that blunts the application of this mental instrument. Help is here. In this easy-to-read book, Brian Tracy outlines a step-by-step plan for developing and applying mental power to professional and personal challenges. Although the text is marred by repetition and recycled material, his message is worth repeating: Mental images shape the physical world. We consider this book meaningful reading for professionals who are caught in a rut or seeking a path around workplace snares."
2,Do you have 2.5 mm headphones?,"Frustration awaits you as you discover that supplied low quality earphones must be plugged into 2.5mm jack. You can't use your own 3.5mm regular phones. Get ready to spend some time looking for 2.5mm to 3.5 mm adapter and $15-20 extra. This kind of adapter isn't that common, I couldn't even find one on ebay. As for the functions, they are primitive. Have to have your computer at hand to recharge the internal battery thru USB port."
2,stupid,I love SRK but some of his older films are stupid. As a fan I wanted to watch all of his films. but I will stick to his newer ones
4,"Duplicate is a mini, happy, vacation, to a stressful day.",Enjoyed this film. and purchased it. A great watch after a not so-hot day! It is mostly cheerful alil bit silly but mostly light and entertaining. Give it a look and see.
3,Decent Gadget,"Works as advertised. Only complaint is flimsy design of the tilt bar - you have to lift the laptop, and really press hard on the bar to get it to tilt, and even then it does not move smoothly.Still it is a good value for the money."
5,Expulsado del Paraiso,This is the first CD I bought and heard of by this artist. He does an excellent job of interpreting the words and the music is very moving. I love the entire CD and highly recommend it.
4,Decent mat for short trips,The mat is comfortable but self-inflating is a bit of a stretch. When you open the valve the mat will inflate slightly to relieve the pressure that is applied by rolling the air out. A few breaths will finish the job and the interior padding makes this mat better than others.
1,Poor design,This does not inflate enough to be more comfortable than sleeping on the ground. Useless.
2,Nice to sleep on... If it does'nt burst,I have 2 self-inflating mats like this one... the first one did'nt make 2 trips and it busted around one of the seams in the middle. the other one has held up ok for the past year with moderate usage...
3,good for the price,"4 inches wider than most mats and relatively comfortable padding. It has a ""pillow"" which you have to blow up. The straps to hold it rolled up are not fixed on the mat but snap on and sometimes come off as you are snapping it closed. It has snaps on one side presumably to add another one to it side by side and get a full sized mat.Overall, relatively good buy for $20."
1,mistaken for a cd,I thought this was a cd and it turned out to be a Vinyl Album.I did not return it because of the expense and hassel
4,A good book in its detail,"""Serious Bass Fishing, Winning Secrets of Advanced Bass Anglers"" is an in detail treatment of all phases of bass fishing. The book is co-authored by Mike Folkestad and Ron Kovach. Their treatment covers strategies, mechanics, seasons, structure, finessing, hardware, flipping, jigging, plastics, serious secrets, and pro-guide secrets. There are ample illustrations and diagrams. This book assumes the reader has a good knowledge of bass and bass angling. If you are experienced and want more detail this book will provide it. My only negative relates to the sometimes over powering details."
3,Dark and grim,"The idea of bringing together DC's so-called Golden Age heroes is a very interesting one and this book certainly has some interesting moments. There seems to be a trend these days towards extreme realism in comics and this results in some awfully dark and grim pieces as in the case of The Golden Age. I found the artwork to be pretty heavy and, well, downright depressing. Other reviewers of this collected edition seem to like it very much, but this Silver Ager comics fan still enjoys color and action!"
4,One of My All-Time Favorites,"This was the four-part Eleseworlds tale that put James Robinson on the map and set the stage for his history-spanning Starman series. It furthermore is regarded as the best thing anyone ever did with the original DC heroes since the actual Golden Age.It's also a lot of fun. Great character play, sharp historic details - with a couple of odd exceptions - and top-notch art by Smith make this a must-read for super-hero comics readers. In addition, it's fairly accessible for newer readers since most of the stars of this comic are not that well-known and thus made accessible for once.Much has been said about ""Marvels"" and ""Kingdom Come"" as being the best comics of the 1990s. But I'd gladly pit this against those, and with its grounding in the real world, it holds its own very nicely."
4,An intriguing yet flawed retelling of has-been legends,"Robinson and Smith create a realistic and compelling ""what-if"" scenario for the classic DC golden age heroes. Unfortunately, the story itself is a bit too short to live up to its own epic proportions at times, and the conclusion feels a bit too tidy. Comparisons cannot help but be drawn (in both writing and artistic styles) between The Golden Age and Alan Moore's Watchmen. Robinson's work resonates with a reader due to his use of familiar heros (even if they are acting in unfamiliar ways). The Golden Age is additionally weakened by being labeled an ""Elseworlds"" title for DC Comics - rendering the story utterly worthless in DC's continuity. The Golden Age is a worthy read for fans, but not a classic along the lines of Watchmen"
2,Wrong one,"This was the wrong one. The one my wife wanted was the gold and it is to much trouble to return it,"
5,Very nice scent!,Love the citrus. Its a strong and citrusy smell. Its an altered Original 360 and the Perry Ellis trademark smell.
2,"NOT LE MALE & I Don't Like The Smell, Give Me Headache","I don't see how Le Male & Perry Ellis 360 White are ""identical."" They smell almost completely different to me. Le Male smell much better & doesn't give me headache, this one does."
1,Not Satisfied,I will not order from this vendor again. I placed a order for Perry Ellis 360 White for Women. I receive the mens cologne which I gave to my husband because I was so irritated and didnt want to go through the aggrevation of sending it back.
5,The Agenda,"Aaron and Reischauer compiled experts in several fields into this marvelous work. ""Setting National Priorities"" identifies and examines the key policy issues facing the American legislatures, and therefore American people, during the 2000 campaign. From Social Security and the International Trade to Campaign Finance Reform and the changing face of government, this book details the problems facing every politician. In short, its a must read for all policy wonks!"
2,Schwartz Falls Short,"I am one of the biggest Stephen Schwartz fans on the planet. It's a sad but true fact. Godspell, Pippin, Children of Eden, his Disney stuff, it all ranks among my top music choices. I was so excited to see ""broadway's biggest stars"" singing on a collection of his songs that I rushed out to buy it. I shouldn't have. With the exception of ""Fathers and Sons"" (as sung by Schwartz himself), the songs are not well interpreted. Corner of the Sky drags and flops horribly.Be wary.If you're on the fence about whether or not to buy it, as I was, I'd say don't go for it. Overall, the album is one large disappointment."
3,I don't know what to think,"I was very excited when I saw that this collection was going to be released, and I wish I would have listened to this cd before I bought it.I love all of the songs on the cd, but I'm a little disappointed in the orchestrations on a majority of the songs. Some songs become to ""cheesey"" sounding. Very overdone.My favorite song, or the one that stands out is FATHER AND SONS. I like the simple way it is done, it's almost intimate. I think that is what made GODSPELL and PIPEN so special."
5,A must-have recording for musical theatre enthusiasts,"Having been involved in a number of Stephen Schwartz shows, I've been a fan of his work for some time and I was thrilled to discover this album. The recording features splendid performances on nearly every track, and top notch arrangements throughout. Although certain tracks do not live up to the originals (i.e. ""Corner of the Sky"" is a bit subdued here), this recording offers a great introduction to Schwartz or, for those of you who are already fans, a stirring reminder of why he is a treasure to the world of musical theatre."
3,A good CD but not the best recordings of some key songs,"While I am a fan of Bruce Kimmel (album producer) and the Spotlight Series on Varese Sarabande, and I generally enjoyed this album, I must say that Mr. Kimmel and company have recorded better versions of some of these songs. If you really want a good version of Meadowlark, buy Liz Callaway's The Story Goes On (also on Varese). The wonderfully talented and sadly missed Laurie Beechman recorded a wonderful non-medly version of Beautiful City from the film of Godspell on her No One Is Alone CD. Also on that album is my personal favorite of all of Mr. Schwartz's music Someday, a sadly under-appreciated song from Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Had this album included these previously recorded tracks, I would have definitely given it 5 stars."
5,An incredibly beautiful collection of wonderful music.,"For fans of Stephen Schwartz musicals - and for those who have never heard one, but enjoy musical theater - this wonderful album is a must. A collection of Stephen's most beautiful music has been recorded by some of today's best cabaret voices (Kristen Chenowith, Marin Mazie, Alice Ripley, Emily Skinner and others). The arrangements of Beautiful City/Day By Day (Godspell), With You/Gifts of Love (Pippin/The Baker's Wife) and Meadowlark (The Baker's Wife) stand out as even better than the originals. Stephen's work has moved from the Broadway stage to Disney animation (Prince of Egypt, Hunchback of Notre Dame) and touched so many lives in the process. This is a great tribute to his work."
5,UNCOVERING A DIAMOND MINE!,"While listening to this CD I was stuck again and again by the fact that I was woefully unaware of the Stephen Schwartz canon. I, of course, was familiar with Pippin and Godspell, but his songwriting talent reaches far beyond those shows. Gorgeous melodies abound, singers to die for and a superior material selection make this a MUST for musical theater fans and just may have those fans reaching for the cast albums and rediscovering a too long ignored talent. A triumph!"
5,One of the best of the Varese Sarabande collections.,"This is one of the very best of the Varese Sarabande collections because it offers a good selection of Stephen Schwartz songs in excellent renditions by many of the best singers and interpreters of show music available. The collection is so good that it is difficult to pick the best tracks as they are all very much worthwhile. Marin Mazzie, Alice Ripley, Emily Skinner, Susan Egan, Brian D'Arcy James, Jason Danieley, Michelle Pawk are all outstanding. It is the type of collection that makes you want to listen to more Stephen Schwartz songs. Any Broadway and/or film music fan won't be disappointed by this one. It's a real find."
2,"Great songs, but mostly bland readings","Stephen Schwartz is a great songwriter and dramatist, and by all rights, should have a shelf-full of Tonys to go with his Oscars. And this collection certainly offers many of his best songs. But as clean and as pretty-sounding as most of these singers are, they don't bring much more to the assignment. They are straightforwardly sung, but not really interpreted and given much personality. One female singer starts to sound like another. The exceptions for me are Schwartz singing a very personal ''Fathers and Sons'' and Jason Danieley soars with ''Out There.'' I also love the gorgeous ''In Whatever Time We Have,'' but I have an even better memory of Lisa Vroman and Tom Andersen singing that at a Stephen Schwartz concert in the S.F. Bay Area a couple of years ago."
1,Poor sound quality,Very poor sound quality. Returned and got an HHX Evolution instead. Bottom line: You get what you pay for.
5,Money well spent,"This cymbal added a bunch of sound and versatility to my kit's playability. Although it is not a ""top of the line"" cymbal, it is a quality Sabian crash. It works perfectly for what type of music I play, which requires jazz/funk groove drumming as well as heavier play when it's time to get loud. This cymbal keeps up with it all. With a little bit of practice, you'll find that evoking the sounds you want only takes a good understanding of how to hit this cymbal.Paying three times the price WILL NOT bring you three times the quality. I'm glad I didn't."
5,Good Solid Crash,This was my frist Crash I had to get a new one because I cracked up my old one.I had the other Crash for a good three or so years before it started to crack up.So they are good solid Crashes I like the sound too.Good for the moneyI had a ZHT and that started to crack before my Sabian here.
3,Lactaid Supplement,"I know this product works well for many people. However, I didn't notice a difference and my stomach still bothered me after I ate a dairy product."
2,Extremely disappointed,"I was very excited to receive this bag- and then I opened it. It is much smaller than I thought it would be and the material seems very stiff. It also seems like it is very cheaply made. The flashlight that is included has never worked. The mirror is extremely cheap and is held onto the bag by a ""leather"" cord that looks like it was hand cut.If this bag cost about $15, I'd be okay with it. After spending over $30 on this thing, I expected way more. It was a big let down."
4,"Beautiful Item, Great Seller","This item is BEAUTIFUL, exactly as pictured. I agree with the previous post that the inner sections are so ornate and small that the pewter does seem soft and pliable. I don't intend to wear it when too active, however, (mostly for ritual) so I'm not too worried. Just be prepared to not wear it around children who may grab or when active in such a sense that it may catch, as you would with any special or nice piece of jewelry.The seller is also fantastic and a joy to purchase from: communicative, speedy, and customer-oriented."
4,See my review for Sea Bond Denture Adhesive Lowers!,"My previous review for Sea Bond Lowers is compatible with the Uppers, same comment for this review."
4,Cute Panda,Cute doll a little smaller then a previous one purchased 2 years ago. A favorite of my daughter. Worth the price
4,PANDIE,"My child absouletly loves it, it is soft and not to big, the Panda bear which is named Jaime goes everywhere with us."
2,A baby toy not suitable for babies!,"I searched for a baby toy, but when it arrived, it was marked ""not suitable for under 3 years old."" I wished the product description had carried this information as well."
1,Oh please,This is so childish and dumb. I'm ten years old i can't believe that children older than me like this stuff!I'd say the age range of this toy should be ages 3-8.If you're an older child like me get a ty girlz doll they are so much fun i have three of them.If i were five i would rate everything five stars.
4,I love my panda webkinz!,"I have a panda webkinz and she is sooooooooo nice!She is extremely friendly and cute.Webkinz are plush toys that you get to care for online.Each one comes with a special piece of furniture and a special food.There is a wide variety of webkinz,so you're sure to find your favorites."
4,Webkinz Panda,"My 8 year old daughter has a number of webkinz - the panda was one of the more recent additions. While she enjoys the stuffed animal itself, she really enjoys the ability to create that webkinz animal on the webkinz website and then play in the virtual webkinz world."
5,"I thought it was a misprint, too!","ChessCentral's Timekeeper quartz clock is *beyond* just an ""amazing value""; at the price they're asking, you'll feel like you stole it. This clock is even better than the similarly styled quartz analog model I bought twenty years ago at more than three times the price!"
3,Not a fan,"I love Shahrukh but this move was just bad. I had to stop watching it half way through. The songs and dances were pretty lame (except for the title song). I may be biased because Salman Khan bugs me in general, so if you like him you will probably like the movie."
2,Looks fake,the stitching on the tie makes it turn sideways when you make the knot. The label in the back looks fake. Not sure if it is or not but it does not feel like a quality designer product as it should.
1,FRAUD!,Warning!! Talbott and Cynaumon are con artists! Corti-Slim is utterly worhtless. Do Not waste your money.
2,"Some good information, but a lot of pseudoscience","While this book contains some good information about the effects of stress on the body and the body's biochemical response to stress, it mixes this up with a lot of pseudoscience: telling you that you can control your cortisol levels by taking vitamin supplements, which will then solve all your health problems and make you slim! As another reviewer has pointed out, Shawn Talbott sells a slimming aid called Corti-Slim, containing mostly vitamins, which seems to have no science behind it's claims.If you are looking for a book based on science and fact, I would recommend ""The Stress of Life"" by Hans Selye, or ""Mind-Body Health and Stress Tolerance"" by David Jameson instead of this one."
5,Why a perfect diet doesn't always mean perfect results.,"As an owner of a metabolism and body composition lab, I have seen some people who just can't seem to get results equal to the efforts put forth. After chalking my own slow metabolism up to genetics, I had a major blood panel and hormone panel done. I found that my Cortisol level was very high and with some research I found this book. Wow! What an eye opener. Dr. Talbot explains exactly why stress will defeat your efforts with fat loss and even why your energy levels are zapped. He also has a sensible plan to manage it and get your body and health back on track."
1,"lacks published,clinical studys by authors","Filled with false and unproven theory. If you want lack ofscience then check the background of author and contact the University of Utah. There was no researchonly conjecture by the author and law suits for false advertising of a cortisol weigh loss product - Cortislim.One study on cortisol was based on Salmon swimming upstream.No doubt stress can be bad, it can also be good, as when you need to run really fast to find some good science."
1,Complete non sense!,"It is clear that the author does not have a good understanding of nutrition. In fact, it is clear that he does not know anything. He claims that fat needs sugar to be used, which is totally ridiculous. Science clearly shows that sugar prevents fat to be used as a fuel. Also, he claims that synthetic vitamins are the same as whole food natural based supplements. This is a big fraud. The guy is a scam."
1,Stuff you already knew...,"Man, what a waste. I was really disappointed by this. Maybe I expected too much -- but it was such a boring read, and all I came away with was to eat healthful snacks throughout the day (duh), sleep well, exercise and take supplements. Everyone already knows these to be the ingredients to good health. There is a section that recommends some obscure supplements, but there are a lot of them and it's difficult to know which would be beneficial and which you could pass on because you wouldn't want to take all of them. Don't recommend this at all."
2,Numerals wrong,The numerals (12 was IIX) were wrong but its a good ring otherwise. I got it to cheaply replace my wedding ring. It works.
2,I preferred the Oracle 8 Black Book for Windows NT,"I found this book too lightweight on conveying real hands-on skills for using Oracle 8 for Windows NT. The focus seems more on a combination of theory and hands-on, achieving neither. Since I am using the OEM for most DB admin the combination of command line and GUI contributed to the confusion."
4,"Good for installation, Backup & recovery, and basic tuning","This book gives you a good explanation of how Oracle is implemented on Windows NT. It does a good job covering installation, backup and recovery, and basic tuning. However, I purchased this book specifically for more information on Job Scheduling through Oracle Enterprise Manager. This topic is not covered in this book."
2,no new information,"This book barely contains any new information about Arthur Lee and his fascinating and brilliant group. It's ok if you don't know much about the group but die hard Lee fans will be quite disappointed in this book. I agreewith the other reviewers : most of this book I've read before in liner notes and online postings. This is strange because Hoskyns' other books that I've read (on The Band and music in Los Angeles) were engaging, informative, and entertaining. In addition, he writes for MOJO magazine, a British publication that is top notch. It's puzzling how he could write such an inferior work as this. I also don't know why Hoskyns loathes the post Forever Changes music by Love so much. Granted,it's not as essential as the first three albums, but still it is generally quite good. Overall, this is a very disappointing book."
5,Nice scent.,I smelled this scent over a year ago and after finding that the price had gone down I purchased it. I have gotten several compliments and now it is my 'go to' scent. Mmmm.
2,"Looks nice, but...","When I received the paper towel holder, upon assembly I noticed the small ball on the small stem (don't know how else to describe it) was done in a shiney finish. Noticably different from the brushed stainless look the rest of the finish has. It looked mismatched, like it didn't belong with it??"
5,great papertowel holder,We have been searching for a stainless steel papertowel holder for sometime now and we finally decided to purchase this one from Amazon.com. They truly can make your shopping easier to do without ever having to leave your home. I am very pleased with the Paper Towel Holder and Amazon.com.
1,Design flaw!,This has got to be one of the poorest designs I have ever seen for something so simple. The round ball at the top of the holder is what you screw/unscrew to replace the paper towl roll. No big deal right? WRONG it is attatched to the base with a 2-2.5 ince screw that is seriously a pain to take on and off. Until the replacement came we just used it with that part detached.
1,Disappointing,"This item is so disappointing that I tossed it in the trash and simply ate the financial loss. This item is designed to look like quality paper towel holders, but those are much heavier and have a far less maddening screw top knob on the top. I have a much better holder that looks exactly like this one on the surface. As depicted on the Amazon site. I thought I was ordering a quality unit like the one I own. (This was to be a gift for a family member.) But I was fooled. Don't you be!"
1,Cheaply made! Defective!,"I have the same kind of paper towel holder which worked very well for 9 years,so I didn't even check the reviews when I ordered another one for a new house. BAD mistake. Either they copied the design or have switched over to a very cheap manufacturer. The top knob is too large for the paper towel to slide on without unscrewing it, and worse yet, the thread didn't even line up which I discovered when I unscrewed it. What a waste of time and shipping costs!"
1,No Stars,"Junk... Utter pure junk... Right out of the box, the knob on the small pillar popped off... It's not even worth the time to get a refund... You get what you pay for"
3,Base Is Filled With Sand,"Functional. Looks nice. Ten seconds to assemble. However it has a base that is weighted with sand, and the sand leaks out. So, if you never have to move it, you're ok. Otherwise you'll be wiping sand off the counter."
4,Would be great except for the screw-on top.,"I prefer the way this paper towel holder looks over all the other models I've seen and it has functioned well. However, I don't like having to screw the top back on every time I change the roll. It takes 35 twists to screw the top down all the way -- time I'd rather spend doing something else (those seconds add up). So after three years, I'm going to buy a different model with a snap-on top and put this one in the basement where I won't have to change rolls so often."
2,Not Well Made,"This towel holder is functional but flimsy. The stainless steel is too thin at the base and the actual weighted part of the base is plastic. As long as no one's using the holder it looks OK but as soon as you try to yank a towel off the roll the base moves around and you get that ""cheap feeling."""
1,Industrial-looking but not industrial strength!,"I was happy with the sleek look - but unfortunately it's kind of cheap-O. The vertical rods that keep the paper towel in place are loose and bending - and really no way to tighten! Nice looking until you use it, then kind of cheesy. The quest for a decent paper-towel holder continues, I'm afraid.."
4,Don't unscrew the knob . . .,"For the most part I really like this paper towel holder. It's sturdy enough for me, but I must not be yanking off the towels as hard as everybody else apparently is. I would suggest not unscrewing the top to change the roll, as it is not a simple task to put it back together. The knob and rod are actually two or three pieces, not one as you would think. Anyway, I've found that you can just pull the empty roll up over the knob and replace it the same way, without unscrewing the top. It's actually easier than screwing around (hah!) with the knob."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY - DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS ITEM,Save your money. This is the worst piece of crap I've ever purchased. The quality of the material is non existent. When you put the paper towel holder together the top of the main mast requires you to unscrew and then rescrew the top ball about an inch and the screw on the top ball doesn't exactly screw in or out easily.I guess the manufacturer thinks paper towels are a high ticket item and wanted to make sure no one took the paper towels off the holder. I can't see why anyone would want to put in a new roll when it takes 5 minutes to unscrew and then rescrew the top back on.If it wasn't a pain to unassemble this thing and return this POC (piece of Crap) I would.Save your money and buy something better. I don't thing there is anything worse out there.
2,deceptive,"what I received does not look like what is in the picture. The base, center rod and small rod are black not stainless steel. Only the post balls were silver."
2,Horrible- unless you know absolutly nothing about computers!,"This book had to be the most horrible book for novices in the world! First of all, this book covers the bare-bone basics. It's basically only for the people that don't even know hwat Windows XP is. Second, most of the book is devoted to showing only what everyone else knows how to do in previous Windows versions. It does explain a little about XPs new features such as fast user switching and the welcome screen, but not enough. I also find some of the ""Go get your system administrator for this one!"" extreemly annoying! The type of people who would buy this book are home users. Now how many of us have system administrators running about in our home?Save yourself the money, and the frustration, and buy yourself another book. You'd have to be a real big dummy to get this one."
3,Title is correct!,"This is so basic that if you can navigate and download, look for something else. Great beginner book! I gave it away."
4,"Overall, was okay.","Items were poorly packaged and damaged during shipping. Shipping time LONG due to blizzard in New York so it was held up in transit, but eventually came. Not sellers fault with the snow-- seller needed to package better though to prevent damage."
5,great book on how to play Chopin,"For those of us who bungle at the keyboard and can always use more guidance, this book offers a great start in understanding Chopin's music. Probably the most difficult piece to play in public is Chopin Ballade No. 4, and Chopin offers some incredible insight into how he wanted it played. As you know, the music notation on the sheet cannot cover every intention of the composer, much like writing cannot capture everything, but most of what we want to say. This book supplements your understanding of the music. I would not be surprised if your great piano teacher pulls material out of this book in order to advise you on how to play Chopin."
1,The Batch We Received Were Stale,"We purchased these quite a while ago and didn't bother to review. However, we think that it's worth mentioning that they were stale when they arrived; maybe that's why they tasted over spiced. We tossed them - what a waste of money."
5,"Snart fairy tale about fary tales, not for little ones","Well written story of Fairy tales called fables residing in New York city. I was unaware of the Fables graphic novel line until I happen upon the book Peter and Max, one of the best works I have read in many years, and decided to see what the Vertigo comic was all about. There has been a lot of praise already posted on this site for the work, but for those a little tepid about a fairy tale, well - this is not your ""scare the kids straight"" king of fairy tale. Very adult material, but not overly so, that you should have no fear of investing your time into. Warning: If you read one, you'll want them all."
5,amazing comic,A new twist for comics. Very clever story line that keeps you entertained. Art work is done very well and characters are very unique
3,Graphic SF Reader,"I keep looking at Fables, and thinking 'that looks cute, but not fabulous'. Looks like I was right. I would probably give this 3.25 if I could.The good Fables have been chased out of fairyland by the bad Fables, so to speak, and now live in, ho-hum, New York City, a massively innovative and different setting for a comic, not. The ones that look like, say, pigs or rats, have to live on a farm in the country.The local political enforcer, Snow White, has a sister, Rose Red, who disappears, and her apartment is covered in blood. So the local sherrif, Bigby Wolf (yes, bad name pun), has to turn detective to investigate.Rose Red was due to be married, and it turns out her fiance was Bluebeard, so along with current shaggee Jack, and a few of the others mentioned earlier, the Wolf has a bunch of people to talk to, including a good for nothing, layabout Prince Charming.Planetary or Sandman level this is not, but it is solid."
2,Most dissapointing,"100 Bullets had me very interested in the Vertigo comic series, that coupled with the fact the cover had quite nice art. Once I got in I found the concept to be pretty sound: Fairy tales characters all lived in a giant kingdom that was conquered so now they live in modern day new york. All the characters were there too... but despite all this Willingham decides to mess with original stories a bit to make things more interesting I suppose. That set me off from the begining.I read on, hoping the end would justify the means. However, by the end of the book I felt all the characters were rather shallow, casting aside the myth behind them was fine, but not much work was done to build up the new characters beyond paper-cutter archetypes. I will try the second volume, but my hopes for this series have been violently dashed against the rocks."
2,Potential Wasted,"I have no idea other than the ""bandwagon"" effect as to why this book is at all popular.The concept is phenomenal. Fairy tale characters forced to live menial lives in our world because of some eluded-to threat in their homeworld. This lends to some amazing possibilities of true human emotion, conflicts of culture and down-the-road mysticism with a return to home.This does not happen. Instead, they fill the pages with half-developed characters, bad dialogue and painfully transparent ""mysteries"" that all but tell you who-dun-it 10 pages in.Maybe this series developes into something 3 books in (i bought the first two and could barely get through the lame Animal Farm parody in Book 2), but i personally think a comic should grab you in the first installment, not 400 pages later.Skip it. Buy the Walking Dead or Preacher or darn near anything by Mark Millar."
4,Excellent Story - Not for the Little Ones,"I found the story well done. You will recognize all of the characters, but don't assume any of them act the way they do in the stories you know. It is an interesting twist on the characters and I found the book enjoyable to read. The artwork was excellent and added to the story. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars was the ending. How the crime was solved was interesting, but the way it was presented was a little weak. Definitely a good start to the series.The not for little ones comment is because even though the story is about fairy tale characters, it is written for an older crowd. There are definite adult themes."
5,Wonderful,"At a solid 4.5/5 stars, this is an awesome beginning to what has proved to be an fantastic series (currently, 12 volumes) with a quite creative, imaginative, and definitely more adult version of fairy tales. Many of the fairy tale characters you knew and loved are not what you expect in this book, and that's what makes it so fun. A definite solid series with good storylines and characters."
3,"a great start, but not there yet...","i first read this collection a few months ago. i was delighted that willingham had this amazing idea...but the problem seems to be in execution for the first book...the story is kind of like a pulpy detective series...even down to a parlour scene in which the hero explains how he solved the crime...the reason i've only given it 3 stars and that i say it's a good start is because:a) it is in fact enjoyable...b) i've caught up and read the rest (and they get better each volume)c) i want you to read it.stepping away from this book for a moment, this series is entirely worthy of your time and money if you ever enjoyed fairy tales...willingham masterfully takes what were once 2 dimensional characters and gives them personality...the problem is that you can't (or shouldn't) read the story without starting here...i highly recommend the series, but this is the worst book in it..."
4,Not a stereotypical comic book,"The premise of this storyline is that many of our favorite fairy tale characters (Snow White, Prince Charming, etc) had to leave their homelands and move to New York City. This volume is mainly an introduction to the characters and is also a good whodunit.I want to stress that, although this is a comic book, it is not a silly kid's superhero book. Even if you think you don't like comics, this book still may be worth your time. It's simply a well-written story, filled with humor, suspense, and great characters, and the artwork is beautiful as well."
3,"Clever, but uninvolving","Basically, this is an okay episode of Columbo set in a world of storybook characters. There are many witty inversions, like how one of the little pigs crashes on the wolf's sofa, or how Prince Charming is a deadbeat, but it's so self-conscious that there's always a wall between the reader and the characters. Extremely postmodern types will probably like it more."
3,Good Premise---Hoping the Writing Gets Better?,"Really loved the premise, (Classic Fairy Tales + Detective Noir) but I was taken out of the story quite a bit by inconsistent writing.Many of the characters just did not resonate at all with me (The dialog wasn't good, but got a little better as it went).I'm thinking this gets much better as it goes on as most friends who recommended it said this first one was the weakest.The pencils were fairly good---though I thought the coloring could have been done better through out.I'm off to check out the next trade."
5,The best flavor,"I love this product and have a hard time finding it. I love it in scambled eggs, ramen and with dumplings. Try it you will love it."
4,Feeder Speeder,"This was an absolutely amazing album, true perfection, its fast, its happy, and its confident. A must have for any fan of them or stereophonics its rock at its best. My personal favourites are 'Just The Way Im Feeling' and 'Come Back Round' these were both released as singles, aswell as 'Forget About tomorrow' also another great song, i reccomend you buy this album and there previousThank You"
2,Skip This One....,"Other reviewers have noted various errors in the book. I'll add my two cents worth on this topic as well: on page #99 and #100 of the book Mr. Newell attempts to explain Stern Stewart & Company's EVA (Economic Value Added) equation. I have no idea where he came up with his definition and calculation, but it is absolutely wrong. First, EVA does not use the dividend rate to compute the cost of equity (in fact, I don't know of anyone who uses the ""dividend discount"" model to compute equity costs). Secondly, he completely ignores the after-tax rate of debt to calculate the cost of capital. I can go on-and-on about the oversights and weaknesses of his EVA discussion; however, in combination with the other errors and ommissions mentioned by a number of other reviewers, I'd say there is more than enough reason to take a ""pass"" on this book. Overall grade: D/D-"
1,Please avoid this book,"This book is a mediocre source for preparing for the PMP. It contains too many errors, inaccurate information and it is loaded with irrelevant information for the pmp test. if you do not want to pass the pmp test then read this book."
4,Simple and affordable,"A very good book for anyone who wants to appear for the PMP Certification Exam. The concepts are explained using simple language and illustrations. It is very affordable and the paper quality is not that bad (can keep it for reference even after the exam). There are lot of practice tests in the book (almost half the book)with answers. The project management process is expained well. A simple and affordable book, very recently published, and provides all the confidence and knowledge required to take the exam well."
2,Where's the PMBOK?,"After reviewing some of the test exams in the back of the book and comparing the answers to the actual PMBOK- I discovered that this book doesn't even align with the PMBOK. The PMBOK has never addressed ""blank orders"", risk allowances, and etc. And frankly some of the answers in the the exams are WRONG! I am gravely disappointed. Sadly, I seriously advise customers look for a first edition guide that uses ""fresh"" materials from the most ""current"" PMBOK- and not just change the cover and keeping the same words like this book."
2,Worst PMP prep book I bought,"This was the first book I bought to prepare for the PMP. I found it to be poorly written, and I barely made it thru the first few chapters. Rita's book is much better, less wordy and more to the point. With just her book and the PMBOK, I passed on the first try."
3,Better insight than the PMBOK,"Thank you, Mike Newell, for getting me through the PMP exam! I passed on the first try, scoring more than 80%.I used this book plus the '96 PMBOK to study for the exam. Neither book is adequate preparation alone. Newell seems to have taken a strategy of complementing the PMBOK rather than replacing it. After some experimenting, my study approach was:1. Read a chapter of Newell to understand the topic2. Read the corresponding chapter in the PMBOK for the data in sparse form3. Do Newell's practice questions for the chapterI bought the book for the practice questions (he provides two sets), and that turned out to be an important part of my study. To me, it was a bonus that I could understand Newell's discussions better than the overly terse PMBOK. Make no mistake, the PMBOK is about laying out a systematic organization in 37 ""knowledge areas,"" 5 ""process groups,"" etc. It is neat and highly structured, but not intuitive. I needed the insights I got from this book."
1,There are better study guides,"The sample questions in this book are very badly written and not representative of what is actually on the exam. Rita Mulcahy's book is much, much better. Rita's sample questions are closer to the actual exam questions and her book is easier to read. Buy Rita Mulcahy's book and skip this one!"
