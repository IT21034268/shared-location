1,SOLD OUT,"I have nothing against a band sold out. They need to survive, they have bills to pay, nobody has nothing to do with it. If you don't like it, just don't buy nor hear it. But what makes me sad is to know that this band used to be authentic, strong. Now they release this garbage. Half of it is great: it's the CD containing the old covers. The other half contains the new covers, and it makes clear what path they are travelling now... The path of lack of inspiration. The covers are so heartless, so uneven, it's a shame to the band. Goodby, Metallica, farewell. Keep on in your great fight against MP3 to get more money ..."
4,"Good Album, but has an unoriginal aura to it.","They definitely don't stop rocking, but I appreciate their own songs more"
1,"Boring, Inc.","This album should have stayed in the Garage, buried forever under a pile of old clothes to never see the light. I traded this album in at a local record store for something else after one spin. I liked tracks #4 and 9 on Disc 1, and track # 10 on Disc 2. I just didn't care much for this two-disc set and I wouldn't recommend it to any music fan."
2,What? Why,"Ok so now Metallica decides Hey lets ripe off some more people because we can't do our own stuff without it sucking! You do know that Dave from Megadeth wrote all of there good songs. Without Dave around they sucked!!!!! I have sat down and tryed to rock out with this one because one of friends had it and I would just like to for the most part this thing sucks!!!! The Misfit's song they did was the worst cover ever!!!!! Hell COF does a way better cover of a Misfit song. If your looking for some band like to make money off of other peoples work then get any of there cd's. Now if your looking for some real metal then go get everything from Slayer, Megadeth, Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Dimmu, and even COF because these bands are way better then anything they have ever put out!!!"
4,This CD rocks!!!!,"For all of you that thought that Metallica had changed to alternative-rock or swing music, this is a change for the better. When I heard the first single on radio, it sounded like the same old Load and Reload formulas--emphasis on melody and pounding drum beats. But when I picked up the CD, I was amazed. Even though they covered songs already done by other artists which brings up the ridiculous thoguht of lack of originality, it rocked with a fervor and a passion sort of like ...And Justice For All & their 1991 eponymous album. The opening piece is a continous headbanger that would make Beavis and Butthead pee themselves. The covers of Sabbath and Nick Cave are sweet. But the most interesting track is ""Tuesday's Gone"" when they team with Jerry Cantrell(oh yeah) and Les Claypool and John Popper. There are so many different sounds you just wanna wallow in the pool. Kickass double CD-definitely worth the price!!!"
3,"Not the best, thats for sure.","Disc one is ok at best. Only 5 cuts stand out. Free Speech, It's Electric, Sabbra Cadabra, Mercyful Fate and The More I See are it. And I mean IT!!!! Turn the page, Tuesday's gone, Astronomy and Loverman were horrible choices. They are either to slow or to long or just plain borrrrrrring. Disc two is excellent IF, LET ME STRESS IF!!! You haven't bought all that material by now. What die hard is still searching for those? Most is still available and the rest was in print for at least 4 years (Re-Revisited). They also left 2 Motorhead tracks off!!!, and there was room on the disc! Check the run time on disc 2, 9 minutes was plenty. Don't forget that the 2 live (studio) cuts from Jump in the Fire EP were also excluded. WHAT EVER YOU DO, DON'T BUY THE CLEAN VERSION FROM THE DEPARTMENT STORES, THEY BLEEPED OUT THE PROFANITY. THE BLEEPS ARE ALWAYS LOUDER THAN THE SONGS, THAT WOULD RUIN DISC 2 AS WELL. ENJOY, CPE"
4,Second cd on this is INCREDIBLE.,"I'm a very big fan of their old stuff, and really don't like most of the new stuff (load, reload). the first cd isn't that good, but if you are into their old, true metal, the second disc is a must have. blitzkrieg, last/carress, and breadfan are truly awesome. on the first disc, there is one good song which is Die Die my Darling. buy it."
3,nonono!!,"Album's disappointing for me, because I have vinyls and tapes of Garage Days re-revisited that are probably worthless now, with the creeping death vinyl. James doesn't yell, just sings, which is plain embarrasing at a concert. Lars and James are always closest to the camera, if they're not, they're making some kind of distraction so you'll look at them, ridiculous since they are millionares now. After Garage, Inc. James and Lars will probably jam with Alice in Chains or Corrosion of Conformity, Jason and Kirk will probably go make an album with Slash, C. Burton Bell of Fear Factory, and Michael Cartellone of Damn Yankees. Garage Incorporated prediction--- Met's farewell album"
3,New Music?,"I already had most of this music, from earlier garage releases or from the actual artists (no Seger though, heh). Too many people refuse to recognize or just plain don't understand how this band has fallen. I'm certain their live show rocks still, but what do you expect on the albums when they use Bon Jovi's producer? The hair bit doesn't matter either way, I'm mostly worried about the suck music they've been writing for about 6 years. They didn't write music on this last one guys, it's a cover/b side album, so it's ok (except I've heard most of it). All I can say is that I hope Maiden's reunion turns out ok, or Manowar or Motorhead come out with something, because metal is falling apart."
5,I'm lost for words,"I have been listening to Metallica since Ride the ligthning. I loved, and still do, the ""old"" and fast Metallica, but I also loved, but not quite as much, the newer material, from the black album to Reload. But Garage INC. really blew me away, it's amazing, they give these old cover songs such an personal touch that I'm lost for words, just listen to ""Whiskey in the jar"", Thin Lizzy made a great version of it, but Metallicas.....phew."
4,Anything Metallica covers is only made better!!!!,"Sure it's not original but it's not supposed to be, it's a cover album. Metallica could cover anybody and make the music better. It's a powerful and heavy album that metal fans should enjoy."
1,they butcherd one of my favorite songs,They tore die die my darling apart its so horrible no misfits fan would ever think it did danzig doyle or any of the orginal misfits justice Glenn Danzig Himself at one of his last concerts in 2005 even said that they butchered it.
2,TOO MANY FILLERS!!!,"This 2 cd set is not as good as I thought it was going to be.There is probably 7 songs out of 27 songs that are good and the rest is just a bunch of cover songs that I dont really care for.What is the deal with removing 2 good songs from kill em all and placing it here?Maybe to make more money.To conclude,I dont really think this cd is worth buying.DO NOT SUPPORT THESE LOSERS ANYMORE!!!"
1,Mercyful Fate covers are the highlight of this collection,The Mercyful Fate medley is probably the most complicated piece of music Metallica have ever done and will ever do.
4,not bad,"i gave it 4 stars b/c it has some great cover songs, BUT unfortunately wat i REALLY wanted 2 hear was somethin' from METALLICA, not some other bands. the guyz did a great job on the new recordings in this album (1998). u can notice how jame's voice had changed over the years, that's kinda y i prefer the later recordings, cuz back in the ride the lightening day, he sounds kinda weird. lol. anywayz, it's a pretty good buy 4 fanz"
3,"CD 1 ist really good, CD 2 is disappointing","The CD 1 is the better one, especially the tracks 'Turn the Page', 'Loverman', 'Whiskey in the Jar' and 'Tuesdays Gone'. You can really hear the Metallica-Sound. On CD 2 the performance is not so good and I only liked the 'Garage Days Revisted '84'. The Motorheadache should better be performed by Motorhead. All in all 3 stars out of 5."
5,Garage Inc. is one of the best heavy metal CDs ever!,This is one of the best CDs I have ever listened to. It is loaded with some of the greatest songs ever covered by the greatest metal band ever. Metallica has once again outdone themselves. There cover of Bob Seger's turn the page is one of the best. I loved it. METALLICA RULES!!!!!!!
4,Terrific album,"This is without a doubt the best release of 1998. Finally, all the fans who were too young to be a fan when Metallica first released their 2 Garage Days E.P.s can have a second crack at hearing the music that inspired the band, done Metallica-style, with the re-release of the Garage Days E.P.s. Personally, I've heard many of the original versions, and I think Metallica added new flavor to the original versions by the original bands, and many times, exceed the original. The new covers are great too. Overall, I love almost every track and can't stop listening to this album. It is probably the most diverse album out of Metallica's 8, especially since it is all covers."
5,Awesome album,"Garage Inc., along with every other Metallica album, is incredible. Sure the songs aren't originally theirs, but Metallica manages to put their feel into them anyway. Personally, I like the 1st CD better, but they're both great. I would reccomend for everyone to buy some, or all of Metallica's albums, including this one. I also wish that people would stop criticizing Metallica, after all, their music is excellent. It is still hard / heavy, so what are people complaining about? Lastly, what is so bad about doing an album of covers? Take Celine Dion for example (just an example!!!). She has done very well, and all she does are covers. I don't personally like her music though. Just because Metallica released Garage Inc. doesn't mean that they have run out of talent. In fact, they might just be reaching their peak, because now they are happy and successful. Excellent music, masterful musicians, what more could you want???"
5,this cd kicks some serious a**!,"All of the songs on both of the discs kick a**. Metallica is still kicking ass, even on covers."
1,This is what Metal-stars do when they are on there last leg!,"Metallica has a lot of talent and has produced some very good albums in there career, but this is ridiculous. Metallica is all washed up in there new album, and there last three for that matter. I wouldn't recomend buying this CD unless you want to hear some mediocre covers of some even more mediocre songs."
1,Metallica shows true colors. They are sellouts.,Years ago this band used to play decent music. Now all Metallica is about is the almighty dollar. The butchering of Bob Segers' Turn the Page is sheer and utterly disgusting. Should anyone ever cover Satisfaction? No! These clowns known as Metallica have given Heavy Music a slap in the face. I don't know what I just said they aren't heavy any more than The Dave Matthews Band.
5,Pure Power,"As a long time Metallica fan, this is one of my favorites. This CD has it all. I didn't like a lot of these songs until they were properly done by Metallica. This CD sounds clean, crisp and is better the louder you listen to it."
2,ouch.,"this is NOT the metallica of ""master"" or ""justice"". i'm not saying they sold out, i'm just saying they're not p*ssed off any more, and without that, they've lost that rough edge that made them fun to listen to..."
4,"A pleasant surprise, 4 1/2 stars","I bought this about 5 years ago and still have it. Great compilation of all the covers Metallica did on their biggest influences. On disc 1 you got the newest covers by metallica (1998, 11 new covers). Disc 2 is all the older covers recorded from 1984-1995(16 covers).favorite tracks include:Disc 1: Free Speech For The Dumb, Its Electric, Sabbra Cadabra, Die Die My Darling, Mercyful Fate, Astronomy, Whiskey In The Jar, and The More I See.Disc 2: EverythingIf youre a fan of Metallica you need to go buy this now, highly recommended!"
5,Great CD-Set for everyone who loves metallica!,"I love metallica since 1993, have all the albums. This 2 CD-Pack is great. I love the first CD more then the second, though. Mr. Loverman gives you shivers down the spine. Turn the page and tuesdays gone, wonderful songs. Its just good old metallica. Load was an unsusal sound, then ReLoad already better defined style, which i like. Anyway, they shouldnt make the same music, they did in the eighties, because the world goes on and so do we. There is renewal. Thanx to the metallicats!"
5,old&new rock!,this is the best one since metallica black! this has a bit heavier stuff on the old Cd and the new one. on the new one ya get some haevy crap like loverman free speech and astronomy. and the slower temp. stuff like whiskey in a jar and turn the page. the old CD is totally hardcore heavy metel and its all great!
4,Some pretty good tracks,"Metallicas Garage Days is simply a cover CD. They, as they put it, ""cover all your favourites"".Most of the tracks are decent, some I just skip, but the CD is worth it for some memorable renditions of ""Turn the Page"", ""Loverman"", and ""Astronomy"". I have the first CD of the double set in my car and I listen to it often.So, the question is - should you buy it? Well, if you like Metallica's style then the answer is definitely yes - they do some very good covers of some songs you'd never think fit in metal (Loverman? Turn the Page? In Heavy Metal? Surprisingly, it works).Don't expect every track to be a masterpiece though, CD2 of the set I have rarely listened to, and I barely remember it, since it simply doesn't contain as many gems as the first one.All in all, a few good tracks definitely make the CD worthwhile, and who knows, you just might like the tracks I don't :)."
4,The only good Metallica album since Black Album,"I know guys, its been seven long years but now its time for the bold return of the REAL Metallica...even though they would die the following year with S&M; and then go to hell in 2003 with St. Agony. After the Black Album it was like Satan emerged out of nowhere to take the souls of these once mighty metalheads and then use replacements that had no talent at all. Okay, with that theory aside all I can say is that this is going to be required for any die-gard, but also keep in mind that, although this is covers its still Metallica and IS good. But be warned, this is the last good Metallica album...Metallica albums:Kill 'Em All - 9/10Ride the Lightning - 11/10Master of Puppets - 12/10Garage Days Re-revisisted - 10/10...And Justice for All - 9.5/10The Black Album - 7/10Binge and Purge - 7/10Garage Incorporated - 8/10'Tallica Albums:Load - 4/10Reload - 2/10S&M; - 1.5/10St. Anger (more like St. Ass) - [-6/10]"
5,This CD is great!!!!,"Man, my friend bought this CD for me used, and i thought it would suck. BUT IT DIDN'T!!! This CD rocked i thought i would pass out because it was used and it skipped and I did not want to miss a second. If you see this CD pick it up, it's great."
3,The reason it's 3 stars is because it's edited,"Garage Days is a good set from Metallica but make sure you get the Explicit version. Disc 1 is alright, it has some covers such as Tuesday's Gone, Turn The Page, and Whiskey In The Jar. It isn't that bad at all. But Disc 2 is where the real treats are. You get a great Killing Joke cover (The Wait), 2 songs that were on the original CD release of Kill Em All (Blitzkrieg and Am I Evil), some Motorhead covers, and So What. It's too bad on the clean version the latter song is heavily edited. Most of it consists of ""bleeps"" that pretty much butcher the song. I highly recommened checking this package out just for Disc 2 alone. But get the regular version and ignore this one."
3,damage (garage) incorporated,"I don't really like cover albums, I think it's a waste of time and the sort of album a band on it's last legs releases to try and gain a wider appeal. 'Garage INC' is a decent album, but is just what the above describes. There are some excellent tracks over the 2 CD's, most notably 'Overkill', 'Blitzkreig' and 'Whiskey In the Jar', but these are countered by tracks like 'So What' and 'Stone Cold Crazy'. I think the fact that the best track is'Last Caress/Green Hell',songs first recorded waaaay back in '87, says it all."
3,"Disc 2 worth it, Disc 1 is not","If you are a Metallica fan like myself who loves their early stuff, you will be unimpressed with the cover songs they have done on Disc 1. It's just not the same Metallica sound regardless of James Hetfield's powerful voice as it was back when the Garage Days Re-Revisited $...LP came out. The songs on Disc 2 are a more authentic Metallica sound and a good collection to have, especially if you want to hear them as they were when they were at their best."
5,Great,"first let me clear up something: BOTH DISKS ARE GOOD!! Disk one has about 2 weak songs on it, thats all. Anyways to make a long story short, this is a good album that every Metallica fan should have."
4,"Very good, But not as good as 80's Metallica","In the late 80's and early 90's, Metallica ruled the free world with an iron, bloody fist. Ever since Load however, thier hold on the people began to disapeer. But, with Garage INC., it pleases both fans. LP 2 has all the gore, metal, and beer for the folks who perfer 80's, early 90's Metallica. However, LP 1 is for the fans of toady's Metallica. What is said here is, buy the record and get your kicks with 2 LP's from one god-like band."
2,Metallica is great....Garage inc. is'nt.,"Metallica is one of the greatest hardcore rock bands of all time. Almost every one of their CD's has been magnificent, but i'm dissapointed in Garage inc. I mean I want to hear Metallica for IT'S orignality, not Bob Segar's! No disrespect Metallica or any Metallica fans, but I don't like Garage inc. at all. I'm looking forward to their next project so I can rebound from their most recent dissapointment.LONG LIVE METALLICA!!!!!"
4,PRETTY GOOD,"First off, this is NOT a box set, it is a 2CD set. If your a hardcore METALLICA fan from the old days, you will like this. It gives you the chance to pick up the music that was originally found on GARAGE DAYS and GARAGE DAYS REVISITED. As well as the songs ""Am I Evil?"" and ""Blitzkreig"" that were only available on a limited print of KILL 'EM ALL. Also you can finally get ""Breadfan"" another cool and popular cover. The first CD hascover songs that were recorded this year. Some have the old METALLICA sound, which is great, but most of them sound like the new garbage they've been doing. It's the second CD that gives this CD set a four star rating. It's the classic, the great, and the awesome old METALLICA style. I recommend this CD set to all METALLICA fans especially the old hardcore ones who have given up on the new crap. It gives you one last good METALLICA CD of the once great metal band."
3,Not too shabby!!,"It looks like a really good CD. Im not too much on recuts but alot of the songs sound good in that typical Metallica style. I have to admit though that I was not overly impressed with the video to ""Turn The Page"". I will hold my reasons to myself so as to try not to seem like a drag on the album. Overall I am impressed with what I see so far."
3,More than just a money-maker album,"I actually bought this one because of CD2, like many others out there.Cd1 has a great angry start with ""Free Speech for the dumb"", and has some nice songs: The Mercyful Fate Medley, a great , great medley and Die Die My Darling, another good Misfits cover. The more ""mainstream"" people will find interesting: ""Turn the page"", ""Whiskey in the jar"", and ""Tuesday's gone"".CD2 includes the ""classic"" Garage Days... and some live Motorhead covers. Good enough for me."
5,NICE,"This is an album filled with one of the most influetnial metal bands ever playing their influences. Even thuogh so what is somewhat of a ""nasty"" song there are tons of awsome songs. They cover every one from Sabbath, the Blue Oyster Cult to Motorhead. I though the album is a must buy for metal heads. I being a musician and all find all of these covers excellent. Some i think are better than the orignals. So i say BUY THIS"
3,"Great to get the covers, but Bob Seeger? Come ON!","This is not a bad album. Finally I can get Garage Days, plus those cool covers that have been such a hassle to track down. But covering ""Turn the Page"" seems like a bad career move to me."
1,How much money can some white guys make?,Sellouts. The Garage Days Ep was the bestest. What is this crap and why isn't Lars under a bus somewhere? That would be great if one day they decided to be cool again. I doubt it will ever happen. Too much money in being pansies.OUT
3,They say a picture's worth a thousand words,"Has anyone else really took a look at the cover of the Garage, Inc.'s CD? It tells a foreboding forecast of what was to come with Metallica. James, Kirk and Lars are in the background while Jason is in the front, appearing to be leaving them. How eerie and sad that egos, personal problems and creative differences can cause relationships that existed for nearly 15 years to end like this."
5,Metallica- Garage Inc.,"What can I say? This new ablum does the band justice and shows that it still is the best rock band ever! The songs show great diversity and some most songs have you reaching for the guitar and sturmming along- even if it is imaginary! Songs like ""So what and Blitzgieg"" Stick in your mind forever and all the other songs, including the covers (On CD1, show how the band has matured with age. Thin Lizzy's song has been recreated perfectly and Queens is just breathtaking. Although by reding this you know im a wild fan of metallica, i belive this album may wet the appetite of other fans in other crude rock such as Rage Against the Machine and soulfly. Top Class"
4,Metallica sold-out,"Metallica were great until Re-load when they were making their music for themselves and doing what they thought was right. But, with the release of Garage Inc, it seems to me that Metallica is selling out. There was no need to release a 2CD set of covers and B-sides that they had done over the past few years!! I bet your guts that they are minting money from this album. I mean, it's not even their own songs! They're covers dammit, and they're making money. I mean doing covers for practise sessions and maybe during live concerts in OK, but, releasing a separate album full of covers it kinda bad. People say that Metallica sold out when they released ""The black album"", that's not true. They sold out when Garage Inc was released. It's sad but true!!"
3,"It's not that bad, it's not that good.","Granted, this is not one of Metallica's best, but it should warrant some appreciation. For a while now, the so-called ""old school"" Metallica fans have been up in arms that Metallica has sold out because they got a haircut and did a cover album. All I have to say is to take it or leave it. If you hate the new stuff so much, quit your b****ing and listen to something else. To those Metallica fans who have not turned their backs, this album is not too bad. I hardly listen to Disc 2, but Disc 1 rocks pretty good with ""Whiskey in a Jar""(yes I like that song) and they did a damn good rendition of ""Tuesday's gone."" Although this album does not even come close to the musical quality of ""...And Justice For All"" or their black album, it has it's high points that make this album a good value for the money."
5,This CD rules baby!!!!!!!!!,I think this CD is one of the best put out by Metallica. It combines some of their classics with some of their new hits which make an awesome CD. I would reommend this CD to anyone who like heavy metal.
4,Not what real Metallica fans should go for,"I think the real fans of Metallica should go back to the old stuff like ""Puppets"" or ""Ride the lightning"" the new stuff is a little waek and if you want a tour of the old stuff listen to this but if you like the new stuff this isn't for you."
4,Where else can you get all the covers from their past?,"Overall, Garage Inc. is a mixed bag. I bought it in part cuz the $5.98 EP is out of print. I have to say I like disc 2 of the set more, but the tracks on disc 1 are interesting. ""Whiskey In The Jar"" and ""Astronomy"" are great tracks. The big surprise for me was hearing them do ""Tuesday's Gone.""Overall, not the best Metallica album, but it takes guts to release 2.5 hours of nothing but covers."
4,Massive and versatile collection,"This may be one of the more original collections ever released. Most bands by this point in their career would have put out a ""best of"" collection by now, but these guys instead decide to ""return to their roots"" by putting out an album full of covers. What a novel concept! And for sure, this two-disk collection covers the wide range of Metallica's musicianship.""Turn The Page"" and ""Tuesday's Gone"" vs. ""Last Caress/Green Hell"" and ""So What"". The former two are slow, somewhat ""nice"" tracks on disk 1 while the latter two are heavy, hardcore songs on disk 2. All are notable tracks on this collection. For sure, disk 1 is more of the ""new Metallica"" while disk 2 is more of a return to the heavy metal/thrash roots. Tracks like ""Astronomy"", ""Whiskey In The Jar"", and especially ""Stone Cold Crazy"" are among the other notable tracks. All in all, a unique and interesting listen that is meant for any and all fans of the band."
2,Metallica is trying too hard with this one and it shows.,"With the exception of infrequent bright spots, this album is tedious for any of the ""older crowd"" of Metallica fans. The high spot is definately Tuesday's Gone. Turn the page is way over-played and listening through the whole track is more of a chore than a pleasure. Thank G-d for Pantera."
2,get real,"Come on, guys. Covers? I don't even want to hear it. Reload was horrible, and I think they're turning into a softie band. I was looking for Metallica and I realized they're not in the metal category anymore. They're in rock. I don't know about you, but to me thats kinda scary."
3,Garage Days!,"Was super stoked to hear the Garage Days Revisited record again. It's been a while but it holds up after all these years. The newer stuff, not so much."
2,SHORT AND TO THE POINT!,"Metallica hasn't put out a good album since the black album. The first disc on this cd s*cks, the second cd is pretty good. What happened to Metallica? There new stuff just s*cks!!!"
1,They Suck,"The only reason that Metallica released garage Days was because they know that ALL of their new suff sucked royaly, so they decided to re-release some of their old, and guess what, IT STINKS TOO."
2,Metallica being too desperate,"I was really looking forward to this album. However, I already had all the songs on disc 2 so disc 2 is pointless. Disc one is a complete joke. Metallica is trying to go back to their metal roots, but it is not working. The fluffy pop band that they are today is still brightly showing. The only decent cover is the mercyful fate mnedley the rest of disc one is pure crap. Most of the original songs are great, but metallica makes them bad. I wish this album was mever made. Metallica, as you once knew them is no more"
3,LP Version,"I just got Garage Inc. on vinyl and the main reason I got it was to have ""Garage Days Re-Revisited"" on vinyl. I've had it on cd since its original release in the 80's. I also got it for ""Breadfan"" which was the B side of ""Blackened"" which I used to have. The other song I bought it for was ""Stone Cold Crazy"" that came out on Elektra's 40'th anniversary compilation which was a cover of Queen's song. When I got home, I played the Garage Days side at the normal 33 speed. I turned it up and the intro to ""Helpless"" was sounding insane, and then the voice track started and it was at 45 speed. They sounded like the chipmunks went thrash. I was thoroughly confused. Did anyone else get vinyl version and have the same problem, or did I get the only one?"
3,Still rockin',"I really like second CD in the set because now I have all my fav. B-sides on one CD. But I was kind of disappointed in the first CD. I was expecting more of the original Garage Days; you know, virtually unproduced so it would retain that ""garage sound"" will the yelling and humming that would tell us that it was recorded on one track with one take. The new songs were over-produced in some cases. I really liked Astronomy, Turn the Page and Whiskey in Jar. And I hate to admit it, but Tuesday's Gone would have sounded SOOOO much better had it been produced. I say, buy the CD whether you are a longtime fan, or a newbie."
5,It kicks ***!,"Actually the second disc kicks ass!! The entire thing just keeps moving and thrashing like the old stuff! The first disc is not quite as good, but a pleasure to listen to nonetheless. I enjoyed these CDs immensly!"
5,The biggest Coverband in the World (And the best),"After the first glimpse of Garage Inc. I was Completely sold. MetallicA is actually returning to their roots again. Maybe not to their trash and speed metal roots but it are a lot more roots then I had expected. For instance ""Free Speech for the dumb"" and ""The More I see"" are to songs of raw power. And Whiskey in the Jar is a very nice one too. The Mercyful fate Medley is the song closest to their trash Metal past, While Mercyful fate is also an Metal band of the early '80. Also very nice and a big surprise is the 'bonus', CD II with all their old covers. You take all that together, and you have a kick ass 5 starr Metallica album."
1,Man are we sellouts or what?,Cliff Burton is turning in his grave. Go back to Tennis Lars. Your drumming is pathetic compared to a master like Dave Lombardo.
4,if you like Metallica,"This CD set is worth the price just for Breadfan, The Prince, Crash Course and Blitzkreig (I say set because it is 2 CDs). I could take or leave most of the cover songs and the production is pretty much bare bones on the whole thing. But like I said you get 'Breadfan'!"
3,it ok,if you like them you will really like this cd i dont regret buying it there great! and its super cheap on amazon
1,Just aint worth it,"As big of a metallica fan i am this is their absolute worst album yet. Its a bunch of words that dont even make sense and i would have thought that they would at least make their own songs istead of doin covers. If you want my honest opinion, I HATE IT!!! If you ever happen to buy one of their cds make sure its not this one. i would recommend the 1st 5 they made - thats Kill Em All, Ride the Lightning,Master of Puppets,And Justice for All, and Metallica-the rest aint that good."
1,not even worth a star.,"This is the worst cd ever, it is the worst group ever and a true metal fan, shouldn't even think of listening to this. If you are a true metal fan, go for Pantera, KoRn, Coal Chamber, Fear Factory and even Vision of Disorder. Metallica is not even worth listening to, they suck....except for maybe their Load cd..... KoRn and Coal Chamber are the Best!!!!"
1,BOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"what the hell happened to these guys?! they went from gods of metal to clowns of the town. i know people change, but come on! this is rediculous. poor cliff is probably glad that he's dead. this band has really fallen apart. i tried to give them the beniffit of the doubt but after 4 albums of panty waist bullsh*t, i can't live in denial anymore. the metal militia has lost the war."
1,Original song ideas have faded to black,"I was wondering how long after the black album came out that these guys would write a fire/desire song,(Fuel).Do they really think they can improve on the original Garage Days?Why would James even attempt to sing a Mercyful Fate song.If you want real metal music like Metallica used to be check out Iced Earth or Skinlab or anything on the Century Media label."
2,"A few good songs, but could have been better","Mostly remakes of their older songs, some of which are quite good. Only liked a few of the new ones, though. Just not one of their better albums."
5,Great Fun,"This album is great fun to listen to, in part because it sounds like Metallica had fun recording it. The name fits; all the songs sound like they were performed in one take, in all the nonchalance of a real garage band. Metallica plays these songs better than the original bands; ""Turn The Page,"" is particularly impressive seeing as it was a simple acoustic song when it was first released by Bob Seger. Many of the bands are obscure, but Metallica revives these songs and pumps fresh life into them, infusing them with their attitude and dramatic flair. Great compilation of songs, and proof that these guys still have what it takes to jam."
4,"Better than St. Anger, and one I play a lot surprisingly....","This is a pretty damn good album. I like many of the covers here, and this album is actually better than the misguided St. Anger. Metallica's cover of Turn the Page is very well done and powerful, almost on par with Seger's original. I like the choice of Sabra Cadabra, an obscure Sabbath track off their Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath album. Their version of Tuesday's Gone (a cover of a Lynyrd Skynyrd song) reminds me of their beautiful (and unjustly trashed) songs Mama Said and Low Man's Lyric. Hetfield does burp before the song starts (bad), but luckily, the rest of it is so good that you forget about this. The inclusion of Garage Days, Revisited EP is a nice bonus, and having copies of Am I Evil? and So What? are great too. And thanks to Metallica, I went out and bought Overkill by Motorhead.I'm not really sure why Metallica did a cover album (and a 2 CD set too), but I like it and think it's a worthy addition to their catalogue."
5,looking back to see the future,When I first heard about this cd I was very interested in what Metallica was looking for. When I heard it I was shocked at good it sounded. I was happy to see that they had went back to re visit their past and I was hoping it would bring them a new future. The songs here are a great cross section of the original influences that made Metallica what they were in the 80's.I have followed these guys for years and have seen them live several times. They have influenced the rock world in so many ways. Sometimes I think they may be my generations version of Zepplin with how they have changed music.This cd is alot of fun.Some of the covers are better than the original versions.The Mercyful fate piece is incredible fillied with energy and anger. Cd 2 is a prize in itself. all the B-sides together plus garage( the original).I wish this would have been the step back needed to see the future.
5,Great guitar work throughout!,"If you want to hear serious, raw, not over-produced, heavy guitar riffs and solos...then this is the CD for you!Oh, and BOOOO to Stephanie P. from Quebec for dissing LS! ALL modern rock/metal is influenced by southern bules in one form or another darling, because that's where is all began."
3,Great for those who want to complete a collection,"I heard the new stuff from a friend of mine and really liked it. Instead of having to pay over $200.00 for the Garage Day's Albums on cd, you can get the bulk of them for less. I have everything Metallica has made on CD : Kill 'em All, Ride, Master, Justice, Black album, Load, Reload, Live Sh*t, Garage Days I,II and III, plus Three imports. I like the fact they Redo Segar and Skynard and show who else influced the music they make. Yes they may have ""Sold Out"" or matured as artist, but they are still Metallica and One of the Best metal bands you will ever see. If you really want to hear where they are coming from, pick up a few albums by The Misfits, Blitzkrieg, and Thin Lizzy. Make sure to get Moterhead's Greatist Hits(*****) and listen to the biggest Influence they Have in Lemmy!!"
2,Some things are never gonna be the same,"Sold out, not sold out - why does it matter? I'm not listening to Metallica for a while not beause I think they sold out (sick and tired of people repetetively saying that), but because the music is just not there. I'm not 14 and not from Alaska (see below), thank God, and will not hail the album cuz it's Metallica. Gone those days. Should I lesten to smth else? It's a hard knock life, it's hard knock life...No scrubs, la la la"
5,Great CD if you like Metallica or CDS that just Rock,"This is a great CD if you are a Metallica fan or a music lover looking for a great CD I recommend Metallicas Garage Inc. The songs I reccomend are Turn the Page,Mercyful fate,Astromony,Whiskey in the Jar,and Tuesdays gone. Put this CD in your cart you'll be glad you did."
2,Not too great. The old Metallica was better,"Metallica was the greatest band up until after The Black Album. When they started out they were great and they just got better and better until they reached their climax with the Black album. Then, when they released Load, they kind of sucked. Everything from their short hair to the new logo. The old Metallica is by far the best band in the world, but don't buy anything after the Black Album."
5,Metallica 's New Cd is Awesome,"People who Dis Mettallica,then you suck. Metallica is a cool group there songs are cool,and well cool. I like there new CD and all there other ones too.... If you sorry ppl want to Dis Metallica then dont dis something like the spice girls or hanson(now thats scary)"
2,Garage Days Bites,This is the most bunk album that these guys have ever made. I think they were probably better when they couldn't even play.
5,better than a garbage truck,"well METALLICA have done it yet again with another kicking cd or should i say 2 cd's with the legs of a jackrabbit on truck driving speed . This latest installment by metallica proves that they are still the kings of metal. And for the next 140mins they live up to that honer by blasting out some of the best music that shaped rock as we know it today. And all though this cd is all covers you have to keep in mind that it is realy a tribute album to the bands that infulenced them over their 18 years, and when you realy listen to the album you can pick almost every guitar,bass and drum pice used at some point in there life on one of there albums. But if you want the best metal cd of 99 then GARAGE INC. is where the real music is at, and yet again my hat goes off to METALLICA."
2,Metallica has lost the edge they thought they had.,"I'm dead against ""clean"" versions of anything. If you need censorship to be able to listen to the artist's message, move to a foriegn country. I won't share this one with you. I'm taken aback that Metallica would release a clean version. I had every track on disk 2 the week that metallica released them on singles and compilations. That is the way it should be now. Uncut. I bought the explicit version, but I sold disk one for beer money. Disk two is in my hardcore archives. The case? I use that for a coaster for my beer."
4,"It will grow on you. The same ""new"" Metallica sound/style.","For a real Metallica fan the second disc is a waste of money, you probably own 95% of the material already (It is a Metallica sell-out for the ""Metalli-rookies,"" stuff previously released on earlier albums and import singles). For the new fan disc 2 will be a good addition to your collection. Disc 1 shows their versatility as they cover everything from southern rock to classic metal. By the way it is pronounced ""Garage Incorporated,"" as in ""Damage, Inc."" not ""Garage Ink!"""
4,Great CD...Don't get the 'clean' version,"While I am very impressed with the CDs overall, the 'beeps' placed over explicit lyrics are far too frequent. They are annoying and disruptive to the continuity of the songs. Unless you have no tolerance for strong language, buy the uncensored version."
3,Nawwwwwwww,"Take disc one and throw it in the garbage immediately. It's not that some of the bands that they chose to cover aren't amazing (Mercyful Fate, Black Sabbath, Thin Lizzy), but there is something so so so horribly wrong about the sound and vibe of the first disc that it must be discarded like excrement.Disc two is where your money is at, the first 5 tracks take the well known Garage Days Re-Revisited EP and compile them with many other well known older covers such as the long time favorite ""Am I Evil?"". Other notable inclusions such as ""Breadfan"" and ""Stone Cold Crazy"" help make this worthy of buying, even if one disc is a mere coaster."
1,"Screw 'em, there are other bands that deserve my attention","Whoever found this album burried in the garage should have kept it there. This album is so horrid. Metallica has lost all their dignity and gone so far into the mainstream it's pathetic. I just say just let 'em go, there is no room in my world for such filth. The only highlight is the Garage Days Re-Revisted because I've been looking for this on CD for sometime now. I'll stick with other bands such as Overkill, Slayer, and Pantera. These bands care about their old fans. They could care less about how many albums they could sell."
1,Ugh...,"Side 2 of the Second record in this 3 LP album doesn't play right. James Hetfield sounds like one of the Chipmunks and the band plays so fast it sounds like they're on Speed. There must have been a mistake at the factory because I had Amazon replace this album for me and the 2nd copy did the exact same thing as the first one! So, I asked for a refund. That was a very sad moment for me. I really wanted to hear Metallica's tribute to Mercyful Fate on Vynil...If you really want Garage Inc. on vynil, wait until Metallica re-issues it sometime in the near future. They're doing that with all their albums in celebration of Kill'em All's 25th anniversary."
4,"It's not original Metallica, but it still rocks!!","First and foremost, this is not Metallica's latest original album. It is a double cd of covers of songs they love. Some of the stuff are new recordings(disc 1), and some of it are covers they did between 1987 and now(disc 2). Alot of the stuff is from 60's English Punk rock bands, but it sounds great being played by Metallica. If you're a real Metallica fan you should get Garage Inc. If you're a musician, like myself, you should get Garage Inc. to hear the music that influenced one of the most influencial bands of the last couple of decades. Bottom line is this: even though this isn't original Metallica, it still is fast and hard. There are plenty of songs to headbang to."
3,Buy it for Disc 2,"It is all the cover songs they have ever done on 2 CD's. One word of advice, if you buy it, throw the first CD away. The second CD is worth all the money, though. It is all the old covers from the 80's, before Metallica became the white-trash, pro-wrestling anthem band that they are today. Back when metal was metal and their jeans were black and their hair was long."
3,Dissapointed,"I bought this mainly for the Garage Days portion of the CD. The other CD is simply dissapointing at best with only a couple of songs worth listening to. If you already own Garage Days Revisited, don't bother with this 2CD afair."
2,"Primarily, should be called ""Garbage Inc.""","Though this does have a few great covers, particularly ""Die Die My Darling"" and the Grammy-Winning ""Better Than You"", but there's a load of [bad covers], like ""Turn The Page"" and the Grammy- Winning (sigh) ""Whiskey In The Jar."" If you want a good cover album by these guys, stick with Garage Days Rerevisited."
3,More whiskey please,"Whiskey in the jar-o es la rola más potente de este recopilatorio. Si todas las demás fueran como ésta, este disco se sacaría un 10 y no un 5 como los catalogan aquí."
4,Garage Inc.- Not bad better then expected,"When i got his album, i thought it was gonna b alrite but it is actually very good, on disc 2. Disc 2 rocks. I know this isnt as good as there old stuff but hey, its pretty awesome. I mean give these guys a break. The've gone through alot and its hard to write new riffs and songs every year. Once in awhile u gotta go back to where u started. These guys didnt take this album too seriously and either shud u. Its still worth buying if u r a metallica fan. Well im out."
3,It's all about disc 2,"Skip disc 1 which is basically the ""new"" metallica doing their new loungemetal versions of mostly garbage (bob seger? come on...) But disc 2 gives a nice glimpse at where this band originally came from and where they got inspiration for their best stuff."
5,I think this cd is one of the better Metallica cd's out.,This Metallica cd is a good one to buy. It is both Metallica past and present.
4,MetallicA still going strong,"The garage inc. 2CD really shows what metallica is all about. The new recordings are good fun, some of them a bit annoying but overall very good. The second CD is just fucking great, old covers but very powerfull and heavy. Personal favourites: CD 1: Sabbra Cadabra, Free Speech for the Dumb and Turn the Page CD 2: Breadfan, Killing Time, Last Caress/Green Hell and Stone Cold Crazy."
5,A Roman fan of Metallica,What I think about this album? FANTASTICO!!! the first album is GREAT because is mellow but strong at the same time.I have been listening Mercyful fate song for ca 1000+ times and other 1000 times i have been listening the fanning Whisky in...The second cd is great too but more difficult to hear. Anyway damage case is big rock and.......W METALLICA!
3,Below th high standards of Metallica,"Metallica are one of the greatest writers so there was no need to do covers. There are some good tracks, particularly turn the page and so what but not enough for a double C.D."
3,Clasp never worked right,"It kept falling off, I loved it so much I just kept it, now I lost it on vacation in Las Vegas and I am very very upset. Its gone now forever, I feel as if I left my heart in Vegas now. Thats probably why they stopped making it!Janine in NY"
3,Good book for first informations,"A good approach about growing plants under artificial ligth. I would have liked to find more information about characterization of lights for plant in this conditions (spectrums, measures, etc.). Well it is a good starting to search informations on this subject."
3,Unpleasant surprise!,"To anyone who has seen the film and loved it, the soundtrack to Farewell My Concubine jumps off the shelf as something you've gotta have. Unfortunately, not only does this recording contain all the lush cinematic fusions of traditional and new Chinese music that worked so well in the film -- it also has 3 cheesy-romantic Chinese pop songs thrown in to boot! These horrors are spaced evenly throughout the album, making them nearly impossible to avoid, and seriously marring an otherwise pleasant listening experience. What makes their presence on the disc even more unexplainable is that the pop songs in question NEVER APPEAR IN THE FILM. They are NOT actually part of the original motion picture soundtrack, and it smacks of something akin to false advertising to have them on the disc in the first place. Just my 2c."
5,It's Gary! A Well-Made Gary!,"Gary is a colorful, quiet snail. His eye-stalks are stitched together, which keeps them from bending in a weird way, getting caught in other toys, and from getting damaged easily because together the stalks are more durable. Again, the colors are vibrant. The toy is not too big; it fits in a man's outstretched palm. Good quality. Packaged well in a tight plastic bag, so it did not arrive with lint or fuzzies or cardboard scraps or other nasty things stuffed animals in transit pick up. Stands up on his own like good little snail, so he is easy to pop onto a shelf. Meoww."
3,Fine little Beanie Baby snail,I love the imaginative colors on this crazy little snail. Surreal! I'm glad to have him around. I didn't even know it was a Spongebob character; my six-year-old granddaughter had to tell me. :-)
5,Great gift,"I gave this toy as a gift to my 6-year-old nephew who is very into Gary the Snail, and snails in general (but only ones with the eyes on stalks). I was excited to find this toy to give to him, and he was very happy to receive it!"
1,Gary the snail,I bought this because my 5 year-old loves Spongebob. Gary is soooooooo small and he just sits there. I do not rec this toy. If it were $1 I would say buy it. But all your child will do is just throw this in the corner and let it collect dust.
3,Great Fan Favorite,"If you are a fan of SpongeBob, you know very well who Gary is. The plush doll I ordered was requested by my son who loves the show. The beanie baby-type plush Gary is kind of small but so is the real Gary. The Gary doll is soft and cuddly. Defintiely pick it up if you love the show."
5,SO CUTE!,"We put this Gary, the snail, toy in our daughter's Easter basket this year, and she just loves it! It's SO cute and cuddly and really looks like Gary from the ""Spongebob"" cartoon. Even the TY hangtag content is adorable! Very pleased!!"
4,Gary,My daughter is in love with anything SpongeBob and it is hard to find Gary. There is no educational value to this toy (for any that have seen SpongeBob you understand) but my daughter loves it all the same. Made well and just the right size for a 4 year old. Seller was great and shipped quickly.
5,Ty Beanie Gary the snail,Great product! I purchased the whole set of Sponge Bob Ty beanies from Amazon separately. My toddler daughter loves sponge bob and gary especially. Great size! Perfect for carting around wherever you go.
1,toxic materila which kills fish in aquariums,this produc which was put in a freshwater tank peeled and emitted toxic material that kills aquarium fish. made in china without any standards
4,Gary is well made and a very nice size.,My kids love Spongebob (and all the rest of his crew). I bought Gary because Spongebob needs Gary! I was impressed with the detail of Gary and his size is nice too. If you have a beanie baby collection (which I do not but we all love Spongebob) he would make an excellent addition!
5,Love it!,"Just what my kid wanted for Christmas.So hard to find this stuff in store, but I'm glad I found it here!Soft cute and cuddly!"
4,Perfect for the fan!,"This is exactly has expected and it was nice to be able to order a whole set of spongebob characters. If you know a fan, this is a perfect gift."
5,It's A Cover! Did You Know That?!?,"Do you know that it is a cover of Toto's hit single ""I won't hold you back""?!? I didn't! I heard Sanchez' track this summer and I really liked it. Few months later I realized that I had heard this vocal (used in ""Another Chance"") before! It was a completely different kind of song, a ballad... I'm telling it to everyone who is amazed with Sanchez' track: it's great, but also try to listen to Toto... Great song."
5,This CD has finally been released again!,"Finally this wonderful album is available again! It has been remastered and is packaged along with ""The Good Book"" as 2 CD set. It was released in March 2007 along with 4 other Melanie Albums. You can also download all Melanie's music at her offical website."
5,REALLY Wish that someone would release this CD so I buy one,This CD is so great. It is a shame that it's not available. This is so great a CD and it is not available anywhere I know of...shhheetttttt.
1,Somebody PLEASE write a better manual muscle testing book!,I am an occupational therapy student currently taking Functional Anatomy. This is the assigned book for the course. It is EXTREMELY difficult to follow. It has ridiculously few pictures. There must be a better book out there for manual muscle testing. Our whole class (50 OTs and PTs) have complained about this book.
5,This book could change your life.,"Is golf about mastering the mind-numbing complexities of the conventional swing, or is about finding the easiest way to move the ball around the course in as few strokes as possible? If you vote for the latter, buy this book and evaluate Natural Golf for yourself. This book is intoxicating."
4,Interesting. Worked Sometimes.,"I found the book interesting, and the method worked for me - sometimes. To be more effective requires purchasing specially made clubs. It is a good concept, but requires a larger investment than I cared to make."
1,TOTAL BS.........SEE JACK KUYKENDAL.COM,[...]i have been using it for about 4 months and have received excellent result.......if you really want to improve........go see The Professor!
3,Songs not on the soundtrack,"There are a number of songs that aren't on the Soundtrack. The one at the beginning when Marisa Tomei is rushing to work is called ""Toms' Diner"" by Suzanne Vega. I hope this helps Rhea from Switzerland!"
3,COMPARE MOVIE TO SDTK,"I bought the soundtrack used from a pawn shop years ago. It was in almost mint condition and although the instrumentals were beautiful, I was disappointed because the song I was looking for wasn't on there. In the movie, Adam gives Caroline a gift,(that she doesn't open until after his death), a box of old records. The one she plays at the end of the movie moved me to tears, but it doesn't sound like anything on the soundtrack. It sounds more soulfull while these songs sound light for some of the scenes they are named for. All in all, I'd have to say the movie is better than the soundtrack."
4,Film music that really captures emotion,"""Untamed Heart,"" the CD, is the soundtrack to the film that starred Christian Slater and Marisa Tomei. Each of the disc's tracks consists of music composed by Cliff Eidelman, and as a whole the score is an excellent example of this composer's talent and versatility.Highlights of the score include the gentle opening track; the darker ""Stabbed,"" which contains particularly memorable percussion; and the triumphant ""Hockey Game."" Although this score is not Eidelman's best composition (my favorite Eidelman work is his score to ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country""), this is still an outstanding CD. I strongly recommend ""Untamed Heart"" to serious fans of film scoring."
1,What the name of the song?,Does anyone by chance know the name of the song in the beginning of the movie? It starts with a melancholy sounding piano before the little kid has what I guess is a heart attack? I don't like the movie or soundtrack for that matter but that song I think is great and can't find it anywhere. Please help!
3,Bad Bad Boys song,"The song ""Bad Bad Boys"" heard in the movie Untamed Heart is performed by Midi, Maxi & Efti. It is a self titled ablum released on 04/07/92 by Colombia records. This album is hard to find so it's best to do a search on the net. Hope this helps...."
3,Answer to customers unknown song titles!!,"I recently read some of the reviews and found it quite interesting the people were looking for the same song i was. I found out that the song title from the scene in the beggining where she's getting dressed is called ""Toms Diner"" by Suzanne Vega. It was a popular 80's song. You can find more info by typing in Untamed Heart music credits at [website]homepage! I hope this was helpful to all of you in need of this song!!"
3,More a response,"Cliff Eidelman is a good composer, but the CD to this movie should contain too the music played and coposed by other artists.For more then three stars the music from Eidelman alone is not outstandig enough. The sad parts are very nice.If you are looking for the song, when Marisa Thomai leaves the restaurant, you have to buy the CD ""The trinity session"" from the group ""Cowboy Junkies"".The song is called ""Blue moon revisited (Song for Elvis)"". If i am right, the melody is based on the old song ""Blue moon"" from Richard Rodgers."
5,I like the movie very much,Untamed heart is one of my favorite movies and I also like the songs in the movie
4,1st song whos it by??,help looking to find out what the 1st song is called in the film where she is getting ready to go out. song name and who it is by
3,"Other songs in film other than soundtrack music. HELP!!,","I really enjoyed an ""oldies"" song in the movie but it is not on the soundtrack. It was featured when Christian Slater and Marissa Tomei were slow dancing in the diner. It almost sounds like Otis Redding,..and the lyrics that stick in my head are ""hold me,..""Can't sleep - must find song!"
3,the name of the song...,Th name of the song u remember is Bad Bad Boys by Midi Maxi Efti. Hope that was helpful!
3,Answer to Mike's Question,"Mike from NYC was looking for the ""Bad Bad Boys"" song played in the diner. That song is by Midi Maxi & Efti. It's on their cd and Amazon does sell it. Hope that helps!"
1,The first song in the movie...,"The name of the first song in the movie is called ""Tom's Diner"" and it's by Suzanne Vega..."
3,Question about a song?,In the movie there is a song where she is getting dressed and i have tried to figure out who and what the song was. I wished it was on the soundtrack so i could figure it out. Is there anyway you could tell me what the title and artist of the song? Thank you.
3,Other songs in film other than score music. HELP!!,"I have given up hope on finding a song that i remember as a child. It wasnt a hit and i believe it was played in the 80's.Well today i happened to catch Untamed Heart on TV and I heard it! It is not on the soundtrack. It was playing in the diner in the background.The song goes somethin like this... Its kind of in the beginning of the movie before she gets attacked...""bad bad boy, come with me, come with me..."" Then another part goes. ""yeahhh, uh huh. yeahhh, uh huh uh huh.""I cant give up! HELP end this insanity! hahah"
1,The other postings must be from her friends or editors,"Because if they have ever picked up this book and paid money for it, then they wouldn't be singing more than lukewarm praises. There's nothing more entertaining in this book than rehashed early 80's feminist passive aggressive propaganda. I wish I can give this 0 star. Maybe its the kitchen/domestic female kitsch they ultimately like, but then why not buy ""Martha Stewart's better Than You at Home Entertaining""?"
5,How can you not love Pavement,Shady Lane is one of the best singles Pavement has put out. The slower remake of Slowly typed is excellent. These guys deserve sainthood for their heavenly music.
5,The most Heart Touching Book I have ever read,"Dr Gottlieb spills his heart out on every page of this book to teach his grandson, Sam the lessons of life. He not only educates Sam but the reader as well to look at differences in people in a whole new light. I can only thank Dr Gottlieb for sharing his insight and his love for Sam. Having a child with Autism, I can really empathize with the author. I know how hard it is to describe the abstract world; and hopefully one day my son will understand this world we live in and embrace those who understand. I have purchased this book for myself and as gifts to share with others. Read this book it will change the way you look at life in a more positive way."
5,I love it!!!!,this book is so touching!!! because it not a novel. it is his real life and sincere advice from his experience. 'Letters to Sam' teach me how to find appreciation and meaning in my life. I really appreciate Dr. Gottlieb wrote this book and show me how to make a meaningful life!!!
2,A Book for all to read.,"Perhaps this is more a sharing than a review. My husband had Polio when he was 25 and for the next 51 years he was a quadraplegic who finished college and worked for 35 yrs. He read this book and commented, the book gave many insights as to what life is really like from a wheelchair and that we are all different. When he died suddenly two days after Christmas I purchased this book for every member of our family to read.Arlyce, his wife."
3,"An OK, not too exciting book.","Most are vegetable dishes, not necessarily outstanding. Certain Soup Stocks or oil bases are quite unique. All the titles of the dishes written in Chinese look very ugly and not artful at all, obviously written by a kitchen hand, holding a cleaver more often than a pen."
4,good!,"This is one of the better books written on vegetarian cookery (biased towards Southern Chinese cooking). There is a pretty good exposition of ingredients at the beginning of the book, and I was able to locate most at the Chinese market. Ms. Lo makes extensive use of flavored cooking oils that you make yourself. This could be a bit time consuming, but worth the extra flavor. Also a good idea is making her recipe for stock; good stock she explains is crucial for good chinese cooking, especially vegetarian cooking. There is also a section on fish, which might seem a bit out of place (fish is not in the same category as land dwelling animals in Chinese tradition). Some of the recipes seem a bit repetitive. The book does include the chinese name as well which might be handy for some of us. All in all a good book for vegetarians who want to inject a bit of Chinese flava into their diet."
5,"Fresh, authentic, simple Chinese vegetable dishes","This is not another cookbook of recipes of dishes found in Chinese restaurants in America, thank goodness! Ingredients are both those used in China and those found in the US, and the difference is explained in each recipe. The ingredients and recipes are simply explained, and the recipes are quick, simple, and light. The author explains seasonality of vegetables, and significance of vegetable combinations, among other things. This cookbook is not pure vegetarian in that a few recipes include seafood and oyster sauce, but most recipes are completely vegetarian."
5,Fit for a King!,"This bed is wonderful, I was looking for a comfy bed for my Pug and this is perfect! My dog loves it!! When he climbs into it he sinks in and is immediately asleep. My only question is...do they make them for people?? Great dog bed..."
3,Here Come the Tigers,"I thought this was a fun movie that was much better than I expected from the other reviews I had read. Yes, it is a copycat of ""The Bad News Bears"", it does have a Disney type ending, but I really don't see what's wrong with that. There is room in this world for more than one Little League movie and why would we want to watch a movie that doesn't have a satisfying conclusion? Sure, it's got it's corny moments but most kid movies do.If you're looking for an intellectual Oscar-worthy movie, this is not for you. If you thought the Bad News Bears trilogy was entertaining (plus the remake), I'd say give this a try."
3,Bad News Bears Revisited,"After the Bad News Bears made it debut, there was talk about another movie that was even better, the name of this movie was ""Here Come The Tigers"". it was never released to movie houses but went straight to VHS. Now I know why, It isn't better, it's only a cheap initation. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is those with High Moral Values will have an easier time sharing this movie with their families than they would the Bad News Bears."
2,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"Crude and cheap disc with bad piano accompaniment audio reveals Charlie Chaplin to be, surprisingly, not the physical comic genius I expected to see, but a hammy 'look-at-me!"" comediene whose subtle facial expressions seems to set him apart from the wide, bold gestures of the other players. Aside from falling down, which happens a lot, there isn't really a single stunt in the eight one-reelers from 1914 shown here, and a whole lot of time where no action occurs at all. Fatty Arbuckle, whose career was ruined by a notorious sex scandal, is showcased in ""The Knockout"" and fares much better as a graceful. physical comediene with an inviting, commanding presense. This collection is shoddy as a product, at least one film's subtitles are in French, the piano accompaniment seems not in accordance with the film's pace, and the screen's borders omit characters that are obviously supposed to be seen."
5,Nice and Perfectly sized,"I really like my gold cross. I am going to wear it to church this sunday. I feel protected when I wear it! It's perfectly sized. It's smaller than usual, but that 's the way I like it. Very fine and delicate. I am happy with it, as I lost my confirmation cross many years ago at my grandparent's farm. This is perfect."
5,Beautiful,The chain appears fairly sturdy and the cross itself is small yet beautiful. It is the perfect size for a cross to be for me. It would deffinitely not be considered bling.
3,cross for a child,"Bought it for an adult. Cross is too small but the necklace was worth keeping even for $30. Necklace is gold filled, not gold plated and that is a big plus. The color is a perfect match for 14K and it should be since it is gold filled. Great length for a cross or pendant and it is a pretty chain. I needed something strong that isn't going to break and lose a real 14k cross but didn't want to pay a fortune for a chain. This was so much better than any 14k gold chain I was looking for and again for $30 it was better to keep the chain and use it for the cross I already have now. This cross is too small, I will give it to my little girl and put it on a small chain she already has. So giving it a three stars for the great necklace."
1,SHOCKED,I was shocked this was very very small. Way to small for the price. I bought it for my 21 year old. I have to buy another one. I will be returning it.
4,Gold Filled Cross Pendant,"This is a really small cross pendant. It is really cute and has some detail on it. It is light, but it seems to be able to take a beating. I have gotten it caught on things and the chain didn't break. I wish the cross was a little bit larger, but sometimes it is nice to just have a small cross on when dressing up. I think this would be nice to give to a child, it is the perfect size for them. I would recommend this to everyone."
5,multi-purpose,I don't sew - I bought this to use in cutting out matted hair on my dog who hates scissors. it works great and does not scare him. I just isolate the matted hair and cleanly slice below the mat.
5,ksa,HelloCompany CloverVery impressive and already bought a lot of the products I'm a fan of this companyThis wonderful tool to cut the thread
5,A Must!,"I went to college with Jennifer Daniels and used to love to sit and listen to her sing in the dorm or down at the cafe in Chattanooga where she sometimes played on weekends. Now I'm so excited to be able to listen to her again! I've heard her compared to Joni Mitchell and I think that there is truth there. She also reminds me somewhat of Dar Williams. Anyhow, she's a beautiful person and a beautifully talented singer. I would highly recommend this album.As an update, I would also recommend her more recent CDSummer Filled Sky- one of my favorites."
5,wonderful memories of a great artist,"I too went to Covenant College with Jennifer, and hearing her amazing music brings back many good memories of hearing her practice and perform live, as well as the Lookout Mtn./Chattanooga region in general. Jen Daniels is a uniquely gifted and naturally talented singer/songrwiter, and an excellent guitarist, who is in my opinion on par with one of my favorite bands, The Innocence Mission. I highly recommend her CDs to anyone who likes good music. As a guitar instructor, it is always a joy to expose students to music they might not otherwise hear, and I had the priveledge of introducing someone to Jennifer's music just this evening, before writing this message. It will be my pleasure to hear her perform one day again, but until then I will buy her live CD as well."
4,Not as good as I hoped,"I still like the eyeshadow. This was my first Too Faced eyeshadow. I was pretty excited to receive the eyeshadow in the mail because I google imaged swatches of this eyeshadow and it looked really good. I don't know if its my brush but it took a lot to make the eyeshadow pigmented. Now, it's gotten a little easier. I still really like it but wasn't very impressed in the beginning ."
5,Adorably cute!,"I like this hat - others have said it's too small, but it's a beanie! It's supposed to be worn on the back of your head, and it's adorable! I've been looking for a hat like this for a long time. I'm glad I found it here. amazon.com never lets me down!TRENDY BROWN CROCHETED BEANIE SKULL CAP KUFI HAT"
5,Not porn,"I am a photographer and knew of Timothy Greenfield-Saunders' work so when I heard about this DVD I was excited.If your looking for something oriented around porn, then you should keep looking - this is a comparison between the real people and their on-camera personas. The interviews with non-porn star individuals become wordy and political - but the interviews with the starlets and men of 'the business' are great to gleam an insight into their lives and thoughts.I really enjoyed seeing the women transform from every day good looking women into the bombshells of porn that most people fawn over in one way or another.All in all, a great dvd and one that I recommend to every one who likes porn for more then just the primal actions, photographers, and any one who likes to learn about random things... For example, the one male 'star' talks about how men in porn are just props, the women are the REAL stars."
4,Very nursing,"This is one of those documentaries that offer you a diferent and more human view about the world of porn, it is amazingly interesting, full of points but cultivated ones from writers, psicologiest etc,, as well of course the point of view of the sex-workers itself.NOTE: Pardon my bad english i'm in and from Spain"
3,Gram,A little worn and took forever to get here! This was Mother's first cookbook. I was hoping to duplicate a joyful time in her life. Didn't work :(
4,A Trip to Holland Through the Eyes of Martina Vanderley,"""Our Dutch Heritage"" brought to life Ms. Vanderley's family for me: their successes and failures, their eccentricities, the effect of history on their lives, the places in Holland both familiar and new to me. I especially enjoyed the story of her Oma and the Dutch East Indies. A fine accomplishment."
5,THE BEST BROADWAY CD EVER!!!!!!,"Sugar Babies is worth every penny you spend on it!But, it is out of print. [...]I recomend this cd to everyone who loves tap dancing, good songs, and great laughs!"
5,"Perfect Music for ""Damage""",Zbigniew Preisner captures the perfect music for such an emotionally charged movie. The melodies fill you with the sadness and despair that the charcters are portraying on the screen. Rarely do you find a movie where the music is just as powerful as the acting! Louis Malle definitely chose the right composer to bring everything together so brilliantly.
3,not as spacious as I thought and too bulky,"I got this bag to carry my laptop and all my papers to work. They all fit in fine, but I had thought it would be more spacious and less bulky. In the end, although everything fit in well, it was too heavy. I would not recommend this bag."
2,"Don't bring back birdie, please","There is so little point to recording this score, that it is surprising that here it is! Except for the collector, this one will gather dust in the rack. ""Inner Peace"" was best watched through closed eyelids; listen with earplugs. Even Chita fans recognized there was only so much a performer could do with one of those ""WHY?"" scores. Buy it at your own risk, and remember: I told you so."
2,Disappointing,"From start to finish I didn't connect with any of the characters. And the story itself didn't hold me at all. There were too many plots and characters and it was really lacking in emotion. This is really strange though, because she has a few others that hit the mark dead on, and I suggest that people read those. But this one doesn't even seem like it was written by her."
1,First and Last,"This was my first book by Lynn Emery and it will be my last. I won't look forward to reading another one of those. Man, it was the longest run on sentence ever. A fairytale. I was diappointed. Kept waiting on the other shoe to fall. When it did it hit about as hard as a sock....."
5,Bluegrass,"I first read this book back when I was in high school, about 1978. I read it over and over,loving all the horse information woven in with a wonderful plot. As the years passed, I lost the book, but never forgot the tale.I was finally able to replace it through Amazon. The story was every bit as well-written as I remembered, although it has become more than a bit dated. Much has changed in this world since that book was written, not the least of which being the value of a dollar!Never-the-less, if you allow yourself to slip back into the seventies, 'Bluegrass' is still an excellent read. Anyone who loves horses and the great sport of horse racing owes it to themselves to look this book up and devour it."
1,NEVER RECEIVED IT-WHERE IS IT?,"I AM EXTREMLY UPSET.... I ORDERED THIS ITEM BACK IN JANUARY & NEVER RECEIVED IT! WHY WAS IT ON BACK ORDER FOR SOOOOO LONG, AND WAS I EVER CHARGED FOR IT??????"
3,Good !!!,"A decently acted film about 5 over-achieving college friends who take about (upon graduating) on who will be the happiest and most successful of the bunch.Not something I would willing explore because that's kinda like wanting to play or challenge God but it was interesting to watch the way their lives play out in contrast to the bet. The film starts out a bit dodgy but don't worry, it picks up just about half way through and develops into quite a thought provoking drama.I liked the title song and overall the film was good and message touches on most of the subjects that affect the average individual in life."
2,Precious on english history.,"After reading it, I think that It is really a good book that can be bring intoschools to teach the students the proceesing of the English literature.Though, it still has some problems on reading books for the old words, its value can not be quoted."
1,Blah...,"The only interesting scene in the entire book was when Leander visited the Delaney's : They are sitting at the table and Nicholas is feeding his infant daughter, having a conversation with the ever-dull Leander."
1,Where'd They Get THIS guy?,"I am a huge fan of Jo Beverely, but this had to be one of the worst books I've ever read. (Sorry) Leander wasn't even in the same league with the other rogues. All the other rogues were intriging and so were their stories."
1,"Not engaging, not useful","I had high hopes for this CD, as I'd like a fun way to teach my kids the states. However, the ""songs"" are mostly kids speaking the words (not singing) with a musical background. The details about the states are not consistent -- for example, for one state you learn when it became a state, for another, what its state flower is (how is that relevant to what the state is like?) and yet another, the major crops or the weather. It's useless as music, and useless as learning. The Animaniacs ""States"" song is much more engaging; I think I'll teach that one to my kids."
5,Worked like a charm!,"My daughter wants to listen to this CD every chance she gets. Her friends love it too. I have learned my state capitals all over again and had fun doing it with my child, it's great!"
2,Not what I'd like for it to have been,"I thought this CD was going to feature Don singing with these fellas. There was no singing at all. Just instrumental. On some of the songs you can't even tell Don is in there anywhere. The instrumentals I guess are ok, but I'd like to have heard more of Don. As a matter of fact, when I first got it, I didn't think he was even involved. That is until today when I got my boxed set - 1960-1966, when I saw that Los Indios Tabajaras is actually on these CDs. Maybe I'll listen to it again and do a new review. Until then, I don't like it."
1,WORTHLESS,"This stuff is a waste of money. It did nothing for my somewhat damaged hair,...except make it really difficult to comb and dry looking and stiff,..and limp. Everything a bad shampoo would do. I have never liked Tigi products so I don't know why I bought this. Probably to assure me that nothing works as well as Klorane shampoos & conditioners,.which Im sticking to from now on. No sulfates either."
2,What the hell was Ark21 thinking?,"I purchased this album because I wanted to support a local artist, since he lives right in my city. Primarily, I picked it up because it was on the Ark 21 Records label, who has consistently put out really interesting hip hop releases, that are at least what I'd consider meat and potatoes, fundamental hip hop, with a little more towards the experimental side every once in a while. This album was super disappointing. It's so cliche and unoriginal, so different from what this record company is used to. If you're expecting something up to the normal Ark 21 standards, don't purchase this album. Even for the gangster style it barely pulls off, the rhymes are average, less than intimidating or entertaining, and the beats are too old school with that synthesizer cheese. If you want something from the traditional gangster style similar to these small independent gangster labels, then definitely listen to the sound clips first, cause I still wouldn't recommend it."
3,"ok, but not as helpful as i'd imagined.","The markings on the presser foot are a little hard to see, due to the shininess of the foot. I am considering putting a little white-out in each groove for better visibility. i had to sew slower to keep everything aligned with the shiny markings. It would also help if the grooves were labeled!"
1,"Should make the list ""Worst books ever published.""","Simply awful writing, immature, as if written by a teenager instead of a previously published author. The chapters were back and forth from one time period to another, difficult to follow.In the book, Miles tells his readers at a book signing that authors should ""Show, not tell."" But Phillip Margolin did not follow that advice. He told, told, told, boring statements such as... He looked stunned. She felt awful. She was startled. He looked angry. She looked happy. In one instance, ""His eyes dropped to the table."" Ouch, that must have hurt.Don't waste your time on this book. Why it ever got published is beyond understanding."
5,Plenty of plot twists keep the reader paying attention,"Margolin's 'Sleeping Beauty' is a twisting, complicated story that kept me turning pages.There's a particulary gruesome crime followed by more murder and attacks that keep young Ashley Spencer on her toes and running for her life. With at least 4 suspects to choose from the reader is drawn along to the satisfying conclusion.This is not Margolin's best work, but it's very good nonetheless."
4,Enjoyable Suspense,"This wasn't the best I've read from Mr Margolin, but it was entertaining nonetheless. The ending was well written, though not surprising for me. I'd pretty much figured out who the killer was before the reveal, including the twist. That being said, I'm really looking forward to what comes next from Mr Margolin."
3,3 1/2 stars - well worth your time,"With Sleepy Beauty, Margolin presents another quick read. It starts fast with a grisly double murder during a home invasion. Margolin is very effective is his use of movement between the present and the past to tell the story. As the story unfolds, Margolin keeps a quick pace and, as usual, presents multiple potential suspects. Although my early guess ultimately was proven to be correct, the work was still very entertaining as Margolin brought everything together for a strong closing to the book."
2,Major Disappointment,"Loved ""Gone, But Not Forgotten"" and ""Heartstone"", but this book was a major disappointment, especially considering how well it started out. The plot as well as several of the major characters were completely far-fetched, and I knew how it would end half way through the book. Sorry I wasted my time and money."
4,Good and fast read,"Overall it's a good book. Author's using time period back and forth can be a little confusing and less enjoyable to read.To bamatig26 from Nashville, TN,If you wanted to know other authors of Margolin's caliber. I recommend James Grippando's books. Hope that helps."
2,Ho Hum!!,"I've read several good books by Phillip Margolin and either I've grown away from his style, or this book is really boring! With an unbelievable plot and cardboard characters, there's very little I can recommend."
4,Review of Sleeping Beauty,"I enjoy reading Phillip Margolin; however, I do not expect a Vince Flynn or David Baldacci or Ted Bell type story. Enjoyable."
3,The book was okay but . . .,The characters were weak and not well developed. There were several flaws in the story line and these diminished the appeal of the book. I did like the way the book ended and tied up all the loose ends.
2,Sleeping Beauty,"Margolin is a long time favorite writer of mine, however, in ""Sleeping Beauty"" with its never ending cast of characters, and convoluted plot, I feel I could crawl into bed with the sleeping beauty and join her in her comotose condition and not miss anything. My brain can only take so much and in this rendition Philip has burned me out.We have the rape of Tanya, the murder of Terri, the murders of Ashley's police guardians, and then, finally when Casey Van Meter emerges from here coma the killer makes an attempt on her life. He is finally caught, convicted and sentenced to death...hooray!! Wow, in retrospect I wonder if it would have ended better if Casey had joined all the murder victims.E.J. Walden, author of ""Operation Snow Owl"""
3,One Piece Missing,"I thought the book was an entertaining read, however there was one crucial piece of evidence not mentioned at all, which would have been completely exonerating or convicting, which is why I suppose the author intentionally left it out. To avoid being a spoiler, I won't mention what it was, but it becomes more glaringly obvious as the story progresses."
3,"Read, but Soon Forgotten","As usual, Margolin delivers a breakneck-paced book with lots of red herrings, a strong-willed heroine, and a not-too-challenging mystery to solve. I read this book on vacation, enjoyed it, but was disappointed to discover that I'd correctly guessed the villain before the first third of the book was finished.I enjoy Margolin's writing, but hope he starts taking his time so that he can come up with some more original plotting. I'd hate to see his books go the way of Jonathan Kellerman's and Robin Cook's: two authors whose redundant story-lines moved them from my 'Must-Read' list to my 'Must-Avoid' list."
1,Very poorly put together,"The first one third of the short film is filled with senseless old WWII history, essentially filler to make up for the lack of Grenada footage. Not worth the purchase."
4,A story important for the continued fight for social justice,I appreciate the honesty and the simplicity of the author's childhood memoriesThis testimony has helped me understand the struggles of the migrant workers and will be a good resource for students wishing to learn about their history
5,mexican,This book is a very interesting insight to the world of migrant workers and their families. You should read it.
5,Very Good very readable,"I highly recommend ""The Circuit"". It improved my understanding of those big families that came through annually to pick my father's apples and plums when I was a small boy.Francisco Jimenez illustrates, with his stories of daily living, the tenacity, and courage of a family determined to build on the small portion of opportunity that they have been given.Anyone who wants to succeed in life can find characteristics to emmulate in this family."
4,Great story,This is a story that reminds us that there are hardships most never think about when sitting down at the dinner table. A good read.
5,The Circuit,"I read the book called The Circuit, when I started read that book, I really like it, I read that book like a lot of times, and I still like the book right now, this is a great book i didn't see before, and i read the book called Breaking Through which is continued The Circuit, that book is good,too.. I have an idea, when you finished The Circuit, why don't you read the book named Breaking Though, I think that you will like it, too... Franciso Jimenez is an good author, I like his books. Anyways.. truse me, read the book named Breaking Though"
5,A Touching Eye-Opener,"I bought The Circuit because I am working with the children of Mexican migrant families this summer. As I read, I imagined the kids in my class experiencing the difficulties described by Jimenez, especially the poor living conditions. Yet the stories are not written as complaints. The hopeful spirit of the struggling family members really comes through, and moved me to tears more than once. Reading The Circuit has helped me to better understand and appreciate my young migrant friends. I'm passing my copy around so that my friends and family can see why I care about those kids so much!"
5,Want to know what it's like?,"This book is a great place to start if you are interested in learning about the life of someone less priviledged than yourself. Perhaps it will help you appreciate the simple pleasures in life and everything that you've got. When you reach the end of the book, you'll be glad Jimenez wrote a sequel (Breaking Through).Written in a language that is accessible to everyone from grade school to adulthood, Jimenez doesn't exaggerate details or go into a lot of long desriptions. It's simply his memories of his childhood in a migrant family. As all memories go, the book does not flow smoothly from chapter to chapter, but rather gives you snapshots of his life, so take it for what it is and don't worry about the chronology.As a teacher, this book really helped me appreciate the lives and struggles of many of my students (who lead lives similar to Jimenez in his childhood)."
5,A must-read,"A fast read, but also a must-read for all ... especially teachers in the Southwestern part of the U.S. where we encounter so many migrant families. It really opens your eyes and helps you see a little piece of what people go through."
1,not a good book if your child is not a math wiz,This is a terrible math book. There are very sparse explanations to help students or parents get help if they don't understand a topic. All the book consists of is a bunch of example problems. My daughter had a book from a different series/publisher in sixth grade that was great. The school switched to this series/book when she got to seventh grade. The seventh grade book (this one) was not at all helpful.
4,Course 2,"iM iN SEVENTH GRADE AND THiS iS MY MATH TEXTBOOK... iT'S ALOT BETTER THAN THE CONNECTED MATH TEXTBOOKS AND iN TERMS OF TEXTBOOKS, i REALLY LiKE iT..... iT'S REALLY EASY TO STUDY FROM AND SURPRiSiNGLY i'VE BEEN GETTiNG GOOD GRADES iN MATH! !!!"
5,There is no substitute for quality,"Works and looks great. Installed on an old toilet. Not only does it work perfect, but it is amazing how a handle adds a great decorative look. The handle is porcelain and the mechanism is metal/brass. Worth the additional cost."
4,Solid quality but not a perfect fit,"This handle is made out of solid materials but it didn't fit perfectly on my toilet. The handle shaft has some free-play that allows it to slide in and out a bit, but not enough to affect the functionality (it works). A heck of a lot nicer than the plastic junk I've used in the past that twists apart after a few hundred flushes."
5,High end look and feel to my bathroom,"After reading the reviews I decided to purchase this to finish the upgrade/update to one of my bathrooms, what a great decision. If you want high quality as well as an appealing look to your bathroom, I highly recommend this. It is heavy and very easy to install and now when I walk in that bathroom, I feel a sense of pride, knowing my bathroom is beautiful with this new toilet tank lever."
1,Top Notch - 5 Stars,This is a quality item unlike the crappy plastic stuff found locally. Service was great and product is great. I meant to give this 5 stars. I don't seem to be able to change that with the edit feature
1,Didn't work for me,"The mechanism that pulls up the stopper in the tank doesn't have enough range to open the flap completely without holding the handle down. IE - The handle moves only slightly when you push down on it.I tried working with it for over an hour, but the design was too limited to replace my original equipment. Had to return it. I found another brand (fluidmaster 686) that worked for me. The handle was plastic with a metal lever, and it worked - had the range to actually lift the flapper off the drain and flush completely without holding down the handle."
4,Business,Very well written. A book I refer to all the time. Just really teaches great accountability lessons. Really blends Leadership and Management together. The worksheets and resources are great. Is very psychological about Accountability. A must read for any CEO.
3,A Solid Effort!,"This book falls into the genre of business parables. Its optimistic theme is that freedom is a better management principle than control. Instead of relying on real-life examples, which might be hard to come by, the authors present a fictitious scenario in which wise older counselors impart the wisdom of freedom to young but amenable auditors. With freedom, workplace antagonisms and conflicts no longer fester. Employees cast aside their suspicions, differences, distrusts and other fruits of oppressive control, cooperating gladly and willingly in an atmosphere of near-utopian productivity. The real reward isn't corporate Eden, but personal accountability, freely given by employees who innovate and work hard because they are trusted. We trust that you'll know just how much freedom to apply before you create chaos instead of conscientiousness."
2,Not sure.,"I don't know if I'm qualified to judge this product. All I know is it did not work the way for me I thought it would. I had been told that as you age, you stop producing HCl for digestion. I thought if I took this product it would help with stomach health. It didn't. I actually had more stomach distress. I'm not sure if it was caused by the product. It just didn't work for me."
5,Great product,"This product works very well for me. I have not found another combination of ingredients that work as well. I have too little acid in my stomach, so when I get indigestion, this product works every time.I was disappointed when Amazon notified me this size would be discontinued from Subscribe & Save program."
3,Not great sound,The sound could be better on this and the mirror fogs up very quickly. Digital display is good.
3,"clock doesn't show when radio is on, mirror does fog up","i bought this for my husband so that he could know the time in the morning and listen to the radio before work. big downfall is that the clock doesn't show when you listen to the radio, thus defeating its purpose."
3,jwin review,"Great radio for shower, however, the clock did not work, but, since I was not interested in the clock only the radio it was no problem."
1,Not Recommended,"Yes, it was under $15. But, it is overpriced at that amount. The mirror fogs. The radio won't stay on station. Buy something else."
3,"Low quality, but decent for the price","Pros: Fairly loud, doesn't look bad, inexpensive, has a nice stand, digital display that shows current frequency, loud alarm.Cons: Tuner drifts after turning off and on, mirror fogs badly, the rope for hanging up is shorter than usual."
4,"Good sound quality, easy to use","This shower radio has a better sound then the last one that I had, and it is easy to use. The only problem I've had with it is that the suction cups holding it to the wall of the shower don't fit into a keyhole slot, but rather they just push into the back of the radio at the top. This allowed it to be knocked off of the suction cups when it was bumped in the shower, landing on my foot, and clattering noisily to the floor. It still works, however, and I will now be more careful!"
1,Not a good product..,"The mirror still fog and it does not stick on the wall very good, eventually it'll fall. Everytime you turn on or off the radio the clock will reset back to 12:00am useless clock."
1,"Impossible to turn knobs, awful sound quality","I bought this and after using it a few times, I wish I would not have bought it.Knobs are impossible to turn when wet (small, round and smooth) just what you DON'T want in a shower radio.When you turn it on, it goes from no sound to BLASTING with the smallest adjustment. Nearly impossible to get a non-deafening level.Does stay on the tuned station, drifts up and down.Look for another model."
5,Florida Folklore,"Uncle Monday is a shape-shifter who for years has resided in a lake near Orlando. Uncle Monday is also a terrific compilation of folklore from Florida. There are myths, legends, tall tales, fairy tales, family stories, and a plethora of excellent oral narratives that have been and remain told in Florida. The introduction to the book is well-written, and each section provides good background information on various characters and tale types. The book also has wonderful illustrations that capture the feel of various stories, and the book includes excellent ideas for teachers to use when presenting the texts in class. It's a model study by a fine folklorist."
5,unsung styne,"this is the only record we have of Angela Lansbury's performance in Prettybelle, a performance which would have given her a fifth tony award had it ever come to broadway. It is wonderful to hear Miss Lansbury do a role that is not the ""normal"" leading lady- she is probably the only living actress who could achieve this. Miss Lansbury is in great voice and Styne's music has a 70's feel, but is rooted in golden age broadway sound. a must have for any musical lover."
5,An amazing series,"The galaxy is ruled by the tyrannical Silver Tribe. They have driven the other races in the galaxy to the brink of extinction. The remaining races have traveled planet to planet in search of the foretold savior. They found a feral boy named Age. Age is the one who can free the galaxy from the rule of the Silver Tribe.This anime is visually stunning. There are so many beautiful scenes and backgrounds. The story is very good too. It is similar to a Star Wars type of sci-fi story. There are many compelling characters, with good voice actors to boot. I was very surprised by this anime. If you have seen Dragonaut and liked it then you will definitely like Heroic Age. I highly recommend this anime."
5,"Love, love, love this show","This show is REALLY awesome, love everything about it. Can't wait to purchase the rest of the seasons on DVD."
4,"Good show, good balance of characters.","Good show,Good solid characters and as the season develops the characters are displayed admirably. It is fun the suspension of disbelief for a the main characters to continue to function in their roles. The tension between the antagonist and protagonist is great and well maintained. The search for the story each episode indeed, entertains and engages the mind in understanding the clues."
4,Castle,Everything looks great. I haven't looked at it yet. I am waiting for winter when I can sit back and enjoy.
5,Love Castle,I have enjoyed my DVD's of Castle. I can bake all day and watch my favorite TV program. Looking forward to purchasing season three and watching season four!
4,"Good Crime Drama, Excellent Cast","Admittedly, I thought the cop and quirky sidekick duo was overplayed, so I passed by Castle a few times. However, I quickly changed my mind on viewing the pilot episode. The show may be somewhat formulaic in its crime solving, but what makes the show excellent is its cast and fun dialogue/interactions.The main character, as a somewhat jaded, burned out crime novelist, is also a good father, exasperated son, and is on good terms with at least one of his ex-wives. I really enjoy that the show is as much about the characters as it is about the mystery.Excellent fun to watch with company, and the music is just as quirky as the show itself."
2,Where is the Blu-ray of CASTLE?!,"The show and season deserves 5 stars without a doubt. However the low 2-star ranking is done in hopes that someone somewhere will see this review and release the season on Blu-ray! The series is shot in HD, and is an intelligent, thought provoking, witty show...but then they think the customer's intelligence stops at the couch and we will not notice that they just released it on DVD?! I did not watch it in SD on cable, why dumb down my viewing now?!Where is the Blu-ray release of Castle? I refuse to purchase this great series until it comes out on Blu. The fact they are taking so long, also means they have potentially lost a buy if it EVER does come out on Blu-ray. Had the Blu-ray version come out on the DVD release day, I would have been the first to add it to my cart!!"
5,Great Show,One of the best shows on TV...the entire Family loves it....we just found it and are pleased to be able and go back to catch up on previous season
3,loved the first series,We loved the first season on TV and can't wait to see the DVD when we have time.
2,jessica fletcher,"Same story line as murder she wrote, with sex.Stupid writer and very stupid police-woman manage crime. Not very good really.tlt-"
2,castle: first season,i would love to give a review on castle: the first season and i should be able to as i was suppose to have gotten it on 9/27/10 but i have not yet received it and despite writing numerous times as to what the hold up is have only been told by sparks that they cannot find a record of my order even when i've sent them the order number. i will say i have enjoyed the show castle on tv however. i do look forward to owning the dvd
2,NOT EMPRESSED,"I'm not wild about the series. Every episode I've seen has been lifted from some other show, mainly BONES."
5,CAstle,"THis is one of the best new tv shows to come around in a long time. Nathan Fillion is good in whatever he does. He was in the last season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the in Serenity, the sci-fi series. He is very funny, but can also be serious in this crime drama. All characters in this series fit just perfect and I hope it will be around for many more seasons."
4,Great DVD,"Well written show with great plots and character development. Always well acted and entertaining. Fun bonus features that give interesting insights to the actors, writers and production."
3,Great HD,The reception is great. There are slight pauses were commercials were. I like being able to watch it anywhere. Worth the money - in fact it was less this way.
3,Enjoyable,It is an enjoyable series but not quite as engaging as I had hoped. I would recommend it as long as the price is right!
5,Castle- Season 1,This was an excellent product! It arrived promptly and in great condition. I was very satisfied with this purchase! Can't wait for Season 2 to come out! : )
5,Castle a show worth your money,"This is the first of many seasons ( We hope) for Castle. The show it's self is wonderful, the banter the chemistry between Stana Katic and Nathan Fillion just keeps getting better."
5,Captivating,"Witty and lighthearted banter between the protagonists, and the clever twist of having a writer who sees the crimes as part of a story set this show apart from other crime dramas. Rick's relationship with his daughter gives him a degree of humanity needed to keep him from being totally arrogant."
5,Outstanding!!!!!!,I was soooo satisfied with this product! It arrived right on time and in wonderful condition! Thanks for such a great product!!
5,"Castle, DVD",I purchased Castle the dvd on the first 6 shows. This is my favorite tv show and I loved the dvd. Plan to get the next season when it comes out. The chemistry between the two main characters is awsome. Thanks Amazon for and entertaining dvd!
5,Castle 1,I love the lite humor mixed with serious subject matter. All your characters jell. I especially enjoy Ezpecito. and his partner interaction.
5,great show,Not your boring everyday crime show. The banter between Castle and Becket will leave you in stitches. He is so far out in left field with wild stories of how the crime came to be and she is so focused on just the facts. These opposite sides collide which solves the crime but with a few twists and turns. I never figure it out until close to the end. The characters are so well written but what else would you expect of the creator of the Rockford Files. Even the supporting characters are warm and charming.
5,Great character interaction,Great show! Character interaction is very good and dialogue is great. Nathan Fillion as Castle is brilliant. This is one of the few shows I really look forward to.
5,Very quick and quite pleased!,Received my order very quickly and was quite pleased with the DVD. Would highly recommend purchasing from this buyer in the future!! Thank You!
5,Castle - TV show,I love this show and didn't get to see the 1st season so this DVD is great for catching up. I love shows where there is humor mixed with mystery and Castle is great at doing that.
4,Oh yeah!,"Is there a woman out there who wouldn't want to jump his bones? I'm not so enamored with her, but his daughter and his mother rock."
5,Amazingly perfect,This is a show for all those of you who appreciates perfection.Nathan Fillion's role absolutely fits and the Detective and even his mother and daughter.This show is solid and deserves to stay.The story starts with a speech for Castle (who is the main character that is played by Nathan) and his ex-wife introduces him and the relation between them too is strictly business. His mother lives with him and his daughter. Then the police shows a mysterious murder that is based on Castle's novels so they try to track the killer and uses Castle's help.It is so funny and well written. Deserves a solid 5
5,Good price on the real thing,"Looking online, the only cheaper prices on the Castle Seasons are on dubious sites with bad reviews - implying they are pirated copies from China. We didn't want to risk it and bought these, and the quality is perfect."
3,"Great musician, pity about the video quality","My wife and I love Jose Luis Perales and it is great to be able to enjoy his music on DVD but, sadly, the video quality is just painful... We could have probably recorded it with our video camera with a better standard. As for he music... timeless!."
3,good to have,very good testimony of one of the greatest spanish singers. Excellent audio but the video looks that was made using a home camera. I can't believe that they missed the train by using a cheap quality video system. This was an opportunity that will never happens again. But overall if you are a Perales fan you must have it.
2,PLASTIC popcorn bowl,I just paid $15 dollars (after shipping) for this cheap looking plastic popcorn bowl that was supposed to be a gift for my sister. Bah Humbug!!! Did I mention it is plastic. IT'S PLASTIC!!!!!
4,Great gift for any incubus fan.,"I purchased Incubus-Alive at Red Rocks from Amazon for my wife as an Easter present. She really enjoyed it. Since it is on Blu-ray disk the sound and video quality are excellent, even on my four year old HD setup. I think this is a great purchase for any Incubus fan.-On a side note, the order came a day or two after the estimated date. I'm guessing it was due to alot of orders placed at the time, since it was Easter. However, this is the first time this has happened and normally Amazon gets my orders to me on or befor the time I expect them =D"
4,4.5,"This DVD is a piece of Incubus history. Any Incu-fan will think it is amazing from start to finish. The quality and camera work is tight and there are 3 angles to choose from. The versions of ""Idiot Box (Jose's drum solo is insane!)"", ""Certain Shade of Green"", ""Sick, Sad Little World"", and ""Drive"" are cool and the unreleased song ""Pantomime"" is worth buying this DVD alone. I took .5 off because the Police song they throw into the middle of ""Stellar"" is really, really gay."
3,Not the better Incubus blu ray,"I have this and the Look Alive blu ray, and I would definitely suggest look alive over this one. As far as blu ray discs go, the video isn't great and the sound isn't great. I prefer the playlist on Look Alive as well. Not really one of those blu ray's I'm glad I purchased. If you are a huge Incubus fan and you understand the greatness that is Red Rocks, you'll be glad you have it, but I'd be surprised if the DVD version didn't look and sound identical."
5,I used to not like incubus.,And then I watched Alive at Red Rocks. It made me realize how much they have grown as a band. Amazing.
5,One of the best concerts ever!!,This dvd has very good picture and sound. I have a 55 inch big screen HDTV and pioneer elite receiver with all monster cables. The quality of this dvd really uses all of the quality of my equipment. All I can keep saying is very good and very happy. The songs are great and it is done in a very cool environment.
5,"ALive at Red Rocks is definitely ""alive""","After I wrote this review, I read other's reviews and thought some were much better than mine, much more expressive. specially Mr. censored's review, you sould read it.It's posted December 2004.The important thing is that you read 3 or 4 reviews and see that nobody is kidding you. This concert is fantastic.Ok now my unedited review:This is the greatest incubus DVD I've seen, and the greatest Incubus thing that I have ever experienced.I've known Incubus for some time now and I can tell you its a great concert, you can really tell how professional the band members are.Throughout the concert you will see extended versions of songs, solos by Mike Einziger and José Pasillas.You will experience Incubus as it is, full of energy and power.you can tell these guys are good 'cause the live versions are identical to the recorded versions, but they have that special ""live"" feel. Or should I say ""alive""?This is a must for anyone who admires or likes Incubus."
5,"After watching this, Incubus is one of my favorites now. Get it 100%",I was really impressed with the performance. I sounded so true to their album..He added style to some songs though.Audio/Video is great. The Video work in this is very well done...
4,incubus,"Gran concierto el de incubus, estaban en su mejor momento en aquel año. Muy buen setlist, el aporte que hizo el productor de Pearl jam a este disco fue muy bueno."
3,TOO MUCH OF THE NOT AS GOOD NEW STUFF,"Yet, I was suprised by SOME of the newer songs that I hadn't heard. Most of their newer music is turning into garbage but they can still play really good. The quality of the picture is amazing and of course the audio is crisp. Perfect. I would have been much happier if their set list had some more older songs. The least they could have done(I mean, if you're gonna make a dvd of a concert it better be full on) is had a bigger set with at least 4 more songs. Hacks! They don't play any funk any more!Anyway, there isn't much else to watch after the really short concert. There's maybe 2 small featurettes and a photo gallery. yeahThanks for making my money evaporate incubus. When a band gets this big they're almost required to play a huge set. I guess these guys are too cool for that"
5,I was also at the concert!!,"I also am a HUGE Incubus fan! This was my first concert of their's, but it was one I will always remember!! Yes, the lead singer is gorgeous and has a to-die-for voice, but that's not why I like the band. They have a unique syle of music unlike anyone else. People say Incubus cant rock, but after The Red Rocks concert I knew they were wrong! I know a few people who have been to many Incubus concerts and they all have said that this one was by far their best performance they have seen! You will be getting your money's worth if you too by this DVD! I am extremely excited to watch this! I've already got tickets to go see them in Loveland, CO on November 19, 2004."
1,This boot covers are for munchkins!!!!!!!,"First of all, you have to pay for the shipping. I did, so when I got them I immediately realized they are way to small even for my tiny 7 years old girl!!!!Quality is chip, so I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. I decided to return it and I have to pay for the shipping back!!!!!!yak...."
5,Fascinating survey of the topic,"In this book, Price sets out to ask what the relationship was between the cult of the emperors was and the state and he explores this topic quite well. The book provides a tremendous amount of material to digest, so this review will be brief.The book basically explores the religious context of the Hellenistic world, the rise of the cult of the Goddess Roma, and the relationship of this to the cult of the emperors. Price carefully examines current assumptions and how they may mislead us when looking at the Romans. Personally I found the chapters on architecture and religious imagery quite fascinating.This is a book that no serious student of the classical world should be without."
3,Med Ball Review,"Good news is the ball weighs 6lbs. The only thing that disappointed me was that the ball is filled with sand or some other material. Why is this a problem? When throwing and catching the ball, the ball moves in a lopsided manner based on where the sand is sitting inside the ball. This can throw you off balance a bit when working out. Other than that, the ball is good."
4,"A pleasant, slowly unfolding story.","Of all the anime I've watched, this may be one of the more gentle and slow developing that I've seen. And I mean both those as good evaluations.Someday's Dreamers looks at the lives of a handful of apprentice magicians, chief among them Kikuchi Yume, as they grow into their powers and their place in the world.There is slow romance and a tender look at how people deal with troubled pasts. While somewhat tired themes in anime and manga, they play out nicely in this series.Admittedly, this isn't for everyone. Some viewers will find this boring. It has a feel similar to that of Kimi ni Todoke or Blue Drop (the anime, not the manga). If I had to pick one word for it, it would be ""pleasant."" Or, perhaps, ""calming."" But if that isn't your thing, this wouldn't be a series for you.But if you like cute, sweet stories about courage and love, then this will be rather enjoyable."
1,Very old book,"I wouldn't even give it 1 star....it was a very old book and was itemized as new....the pages were all yellow and very old...it had a new soft cover, but my grandson was very disappointed"
5,Best Music Score,I think this is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. It almost makes you cry! A definate on the essential CD list.
4,Amy Vanderbilt's cookbook,"This is almost an antique. My daughter wanted it so I purchased it for her. it was hard to find, but I found a used copy on Amazon & was happy. we used to have my Mom's copy but couldn't find it. great recipes. it was in good condition."
5,I found my lost Cook Book,"I was actually surprised at the condition it arrived in, since it is 40+ yrs old. I lost this Cook Book a few years ago and was so happy that I found it on Amazon. It had the one Sweet and Sour recipe that was a favorite for me and my family. I love being able to make our favorite meals now that I have it again"
4,great product,iI have tried several different products and nothing has come as close to working as this product I highly recomed trying it.
3,Disappointing selection of music,"I love the Once Upon a Time in China series, I love the Swordsman series, I love Jackie Chan's movies. But somehow this cd doesn't do it for me. The song selections are peculiarly slow, not at all the heart-pumping action-packed music of Hong Kong's most famous martial arts movies.The best pieces are the selections from Once Upon a Time in China and The East is Red, but they're slower versions of the themes. It's as if someone bought the OUATIC soundtrack and chose only the slow songs off it to make a new compilation. Likewise, the selections from The East is Red don't even include the Hero of Heroes song that is the basic theme to the whole trilogy. If what you're looking for are the rousing themes from these movies, you'd better keep looking for the movie soundtracks."
3,Once Upon a Time in China,"If you want to feel the pulsating rhythm of a gloriously done Hong Kong movie, then this is the soundtrack to buy. The music is a great blend of percussion that makes you want to kick and punch something and tender string instrumentals for those tender moments. If you have seen the movie and are a fan of Hong Kong Martial Arts movies, then this is a must. Some of the best Chinese music artist do their finest."
5,Super CD,A very good CD! It's one of the best Soundtrack CD's I've ever heard. The shipping was very fast. Really good service.
3,Once Upon a Time in the East,"""Once Upon a Time in China"" is a fun compendium of soundtracks from Hong Kong action films. They're instrumentals. What's interesting, however, is that this goes for more quiet instrumentals than pulsing,heart-thumping music that would accompany Jackie Chan or Jet Li knocking out bad guys. It's more traditional-sounding than one would expect.""Once upon a Time in China"" has great selections like the exciting ""Fighting Assassins"",""Desperate Battle"",""Out of luck hero"" and ""Night Attack."" There are more romantic selections such as ""Between love and hate"" and ""Aura of passion.""""Once upon a Time in China"" is an accessible introduction to Chinese music."
4,Quite good,"The first half of the cd is excellent! Sensitive and modern Chinese music that's a pleasure to listen to. Not the usual solemn tones, some of these really move. The second half of the cd is canned and rather dull, but it's worth it just for the first part."
3,Not a bad CD--but definitely not complete.,"The music is so much different from American film scores, that it's probably worth ordering. However, if you're familar with Hong Kong cinema, the glaring omission of at least ONE of John Woo's films is a real annoyance. The title indicates there may be future volumes. Let's hope at least ""The Killer"" or ""Bullet in the Head"" is included then."
5,Required reading for a Zen novice,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and it has inspired me in my own spiritual journey. Kapleau truly helps westerners understand ""satori"" -- the path to enlightenment. Some of the big questions: whatis the essence of ""mu"" -- nothingness/oneness? How do some reach enlightenment faster than others? For those who are willing to read and ponder some of the accounts expressed in this book there are many rewards."
4,a forgettable must read,"An interesting contrast to the more traditional Soto style (with its emphasis on just sitting and not forcing) although the approach in this book does incorporate most of the commonly used methods of practice. I enjoyed this read because it gave perspective to the type of practice that ""feels"" right for me, I now know this even more so having read of the approachs taken by this author. Even if you may not agree with the approach to Zen practice outlined in this book, it is still a must read, it will re-affirm your perspective or provide new insights, either way it should be read and forgotten."
3,The next best thing,"Do not expect to read this as a ""Zen for Dummies"". Unfortunately trying to learn Zen from a book is a little bit like teaching someone who has been born blind to ""imagine"" various colors such as red, blue or green. Zen has to be experienced to be understood. Having said that, however, this book is probably the next best thing."
3,interesting,"the book is interesting because it includes some enlightenment experiences from several modern day people, including the author. it brings modern zen a little closer to home, something that stories of ancient sages do not always do. a thumbs up to that part of the book."
3,Good but sorely limited in scope and vision,"This book was a revelation when published but is now only a good introduction to Zen practice. If one takes the impression presented here, you would think that sitting is the ultimate (indeed only) goal of Zen. The Buddha taught the Eightfold Path, which goes far beyond the duality of ""sitting is good, worldly life bad"" this book implies. The militaristic style of Zen taught here has its merits but can also be used to suppress and damage people. Don't forget, self and no-self are both incomplete views!!"
5,Zen Basics,"I have read a number of books which deal in abstract ways with Zen meaning and practice (e.g. Alan Watts). The Three Pillars of Zen seems to offer more concrete observations of basic Japanese Zen practice with less emphasis on the Buddhist aspects. I'd recommend it as a basic text for anyone practicing, or planning on practicing, zen meditation."
5,Best book on Zen,"After reading several books on Buddhism I determined to find out more about Zen. The `Idiots Guide to Zen Living' left me confused. This book by contrast was interesting to read from page one and organized in an efficient and logical manner. Well documented, clear instruction, positive and complete. Other classic books fall into place once you're read this. (Zen Mind, Beginners Mind Suzuki for example) Great price too, I would have expected to pay $20 plus for this book. Buy this now, you'll be very happy that you did."
5,"This book teaches true Zen practice, beyond mere philosophy","I have read this book and recomended it over and again. What makes it special is that the practice for Zen living is emphasized beyond the mere philosophy of Zen. This is important because, as often misunderstood, Zen is not philosophy but practice- a way of life. The author has the understanding that true knowledge is only gained through practice and experience. He does not deny the years of disciplined sitting and diligence necessary to master oneself. There is no easy way, but the techniques given are sound and true and will facilitate your journey."
3,"Very deep, but...","The book offers a deep vision on Zen teachings, but sometimes I found myself overthinking about how zazen should be practiced. There's a lot of conceptualization and I felt that has made the practice less natural sometimes. Besides that, this is an awesome book!"
5,The Finest book on zen ever written,"I have practiced and taught Zen meditation for many years.I first read this book about 15 years ago and it still gives me the desire to sit. I've bought about 6 copies through the years which of all have been made gifts to various students.Please read this book, you'll be sure to get nothing out of it!"
3,Somewhat useful; get it on sale,"Looks like this item is being discontinued. I picked mine up on a whim at REI for about $60, marked down from $120.I've experimented with this little thing a bit, and it will charge my BlackBerry Curve easily enough with direct sun contact here in Chicago. It will product some current through a window, but it's not really enough to do much other than give the phone the idea that it's plugged in without actually charging. I can't seem to get it to work with the iPod Touch or iPhone, however. Still working on it. Haven't tried the battery charger.Edit: WAS finally able to get it to charge the iPod Touch and iPhone via cigarette lighter adapter. Still won't do it off of USB, but that doesn't bother me. Another thing to carry, but not a big deal. I'd bump this thing up to 4 stars now."
4,"Great product - sturdy, lightweight, reliable","I used this on a backpacking trip in the Rocky Mountains. It performed very well. The BattJack (AA/AAA) charger is really handy and works well too. One item of note is to make sure you try charging using 6V first as this mode works best for most devices. Also, be careful of the polarity on the adapters. Read the instructions BEFORE using the unit. The only things I might recommend to Brunton is to add a cover for the side connector panel to help keep dirt and moisture out when using outdoors and to include a couple other adapters because most of my electronics DO NOT use the 3.5mm or 5.5 mm adapters that come with the unit. I understand from another review that you can purchase more adapters at Radio Shack, but have not confirmed this as yet. [...] The adapter shortage is the only reason I gave this unit 4 stars...."
4,It works but...,"I, like many others had a hard time figuring out how to get this thing to work. It has one major design flaw. When it is not in DIRECT sunlight, the battery charger indicator lights will show that the batteries are fully charged. For a long time I thought that it wasn't working.It needs full on, undiffused sunlight or it just won't work. When you find a patch of sunlight it works great. Due to this I would recommend keeping a good supply of charged batteries on hand if on a long trip out in the field in case of extended times of cloudiness.For the money it works well, just make sure you keep it in DIRECT sunlight."
4,"Good product, but a few caveats","Generally, I find the Brunton Solarport works as advertised, but there are a couple things people should know before getting one. First, it has trouble charging hi-capacity NiMH batteries (1800mAh +). It might charge 2 in very bright light, but not 4. Second, don't expect it to charge well using light that has passed through a window. Window glass often filters and/or reflects light, so the unit receives less light and is therefore less effective. (Of course, you can solve these problems by spending another $100 for another Solarport and linking the 2 together, but for $200 you might consider another solar option.)"
1,Poor results and no response from tech support,I am very disappointed in the Brunton Solarport 4.4. I wanted to charge my iPhone but was unable to charge it; even in full sunlight with the phone turned off. It did charge my Garmin Forerunner (a smaller device.) Not much bang for the buck; I wouldn't recommend it. No response from product support guy; won't return calls.
5,solar power,"The solarport has some really neat features. It includes a cigarette lighter plug-in port and it also comes with a battery recharger for AA and AAA batteries. One down side is to charge your cell phone you have to turn it off, which can be frustrating to turn off your phone in the middle of the day. However, it charges really quick in bout 3 minutes i can charge my cell phone 5%. This is a really good product for camping and hiking also. I'm still figuring out new ways to use it every day. It is one of my favorite gadgets and I reccomend it."
1,Dreadful.,"RUTHLESS! sets out to lampoon Broadway musicals, but not by neatly skewering flaws. Instead, it simply does what most musicals do, only very badly. They have compiled a cast of people who cannot really sing (well, maybe some of the poor vocalizing is intentional) to sing clunky, grating, and unfunny songs to the accompaniment of an orchestra of maybe four or five people, while wearing ugly costumes and bad makeup. Its creators obviously are proud of their baby; the self-satisfaction drips out of every line. This is a musical that hates musicals but is in love with itself. No, thank you."
1,DISGUSTING,"If you like good Broadway shows, don't get this one! The concept is so ridicoulously stupid. The singers can't sing, and the songs are absolutely sickening!"
4,Funny Parody,"Ruthless is a hilarious show--a must-buy for any Broadway buff. With a small cast and a very talented young girl, this show is too entertaining,,,a little girl murders another girl so she can play the lead in the school show...reminiscient of Gypsy (and references are made). Excellent singers, many doubling in more than one role, complete this album. Note: the charcter of Louise is supposed to sing badly!"
5,High quality garment,"The jacket is very fine quality and has a great fit.The sleeve length is fine and it is a shorter jacket than some. It is not too dressy but dressy enough for the wedding I purchased it for. A concern is always whether or not you can see ""thru"" a light colored top but this is a very dense knit and wouldn't require a cami underneath."
2,A joke with benefits,"2 1/2Decaying datedness pervades this shining example of indulgent '70s British rock, where Hillage provides ample guitar goodness but crashes and burns as frontman. The singing and lyrics are just a burden, at their worst reeking of Spinal Tap-worthy parody. I would be the first to appreciate butchered themes of spiritual awakenings, except they are rendered ineffectively limp from deadened phrasings and goofy delivery, although somehow he made the somewhat successful lead-off Hurdy work around the off-putting approach, and the Mahavishnu-wannabe Om Nama Shivaya doesn't go out of it's way to embarrass. Throughout L, instrumental passages will remind listeners how we've arrived here in the first place, but this is not recommended for fans of the guitarist's work in progressive groups."
2,Full of Mistakes,"I just completed my first year gross anatomy course and this book was required. The concept is excellent and the plates are amazing but there is one problem, the book has many mistakes. It was very confusing to learn the relationship of structures then turn to the cross-sectional book only to see the same structures mislabeled. If a newer addition is corrected, I would bump this up to a 4-5 star rating."
3,Good,"I actually found this on vinyl for a dollar. One of those weird little things you could never find if hunting for it, or you would pay a mint if you did.I don't know anything about the composer Laurie Johnson--although it is great to know a women could do a major score in the 1960s.And the more I play her music, the more I like her music. On vinyl, this starts out with a lot of murky orchestral music. It is subtle, and did not grab me right away,But I am a hog for big orchestral TV funk of this era, and as the album goes on, the funk factor increases. Johnson has a symphonic approach to this--there is not a wha wha in earshot. What makes the music funky are the jagged edges--mainly provided by horns--Johnson uses to punctuate her music.If you're a DJ you should crate dig this. A lot of edges for samples and those instrumental interludes make for great bridges between more popular tracks."
3,One Foot in Hell,"Alan Ladd fans will appreciate this film about a civil war veteran who attempts to get townsfolk to help his critically ill wife. They turn him away and he resorts to a well-planned course of revenge to return their misdeeds. In the end, his own evil side does him in and the age old moral, good over evil triumphs."
2,Not bad but not great,The techniques described are too heavily influenced by judo & karate to be true jujitsu but its still a worthwhile read.
1,"What a wonderful voice Mary has, but a poor repertoire","Mary is a very gifted singer. She is what a cabaret singer should be.The main concern I have about this cd, is that she choose too many lesser known tunes. Also her trio was not real melodic on a lot of these tunes. There were some tunes where the trio really did some great playing, but not enough...Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd."
4,Good reference book,"This is a good reference book, albeit a bit outdated. Gunsmithing doesn't change with time, but the type of guns do. In this sense, the book is a bit outdated, but the different projects are well explained, and it seems to me that this edition has more pictorial elements."
5,Practical Gunsmithing,This book came well packaged and as described for being a used book. The pictures in the book are clear and support the text.
1,"The three ""D's""----Disappointing, Dull, Dumb!","There is no excuse for the lack of content in this book; most of the pages were half blank! I cannot imagine giving this book as a gift to my bright, energetic 60-year-old friends---it would be an insult! My advice, do not waste your money on this book!"
5,You might as well laugh,"I saw this book in a gift shop and knew I could get it at a better price through Amazon, so I ordered a copy for my cousin, who turned 60 last month. She has since bought copies for her friends who are turning 60. It's a great gift book with funny insights, not just platitudes about the aging process. A little humor goes a long way!"
2,"Product cute, delivery terrible","I bought this book as a birthday gift. When it finally arrived more than a week and a half later (even with express shipping), I delivered it late to the birthday girl. We looked at it and had a lot of laughs. Cute book to ease the pain of turning 60."
4,GREAT 60th BIRTHDAY GIFT,I gave this book to a friend who enjoyed it so much that she in turn bought the book to give to others who are turning 60. Great gift idea for that special female friend.
5,Awesome for everyone!,"I work at a Day Camp for K-5 kids and they absolutely love these stories. They used to complain about having to have Bible Study, but now they can't wait!"
3,Not what I expected.,I bought this book in error. It was not what I expected. I thought it might be a humorous look at the Bible but it is in fact a book of religious instruction for younger readers. I guess I should have read the reviews before purchasing.
2,Don't Judge this Disturbing Book by it's Cover,"The book looked like a fun, light-hearted read: wrong.I admit I didn't finish the book and probably won't--which is unusual for me.It was creepy with undercurrents that had the potential to scare the crap out of a child . . . Old fairy tales were criticized for being too scary: this is ""Hansel and Gretel"" go to church?It might be a helpful book for an adult leading Sunday School, but please don't hand this book to a child without reading it and making up your own mind."
1,What a bore!,I downloaded this book because of the positive reviews. After reading 30% of the book and hoping that it would get interesting I finally gave up. What a waste of my time.
5,Classically funny!,"Three ladies of a certain age set out out on adventures led by the indomitable Letitia Carberry affectionately known as Tish. Fearless and exasperating, Tish always knows best. Definitely a most enjoyable read!"
2,Short,This turned out to be shorter than expected and almost too short to take pasta from boiling water.
4,Loved What I Got,"Just what I wanted. Very helpful for serving any pasta, noodles or salad. Also quite good for any dish where you need to pick up larger individual items. I gave it 4 stars, because the metal is a tad hard, needs a little more strength to squeeze together; for women that is."
5,The Summer House (Silhouette Special Edit,This was a great story and reading it on my new mini Ipad made it even better. i am reading a book a week.
2,okay book,This book was okay but the characters weren't developed well enough for me to really care about them. I don't think this is either of the authors' best efforts.
4,"Delta 1824-74 Monitor 18 Series Jetted Shower Trim, Chrome","It came OK,valve, trim & rough with additional, spare hardware (bottom of in-the-wall rough piece, no spare top part for jets). It all worked for me well.I was replacing the 6 years old model, the thin-wall tube connection between bottom of rough piece & top part for jets corroded. I replaced it all. I hope it will last longer.I wished, Delta used just better pipe...Shower action is good, smooth dials. Spray is good."
1,What is the deal with the pricing?,"If you buy a single unit, it costs ~$350 ish per unit in a box. If you divide 20 units into $12,000 it comes out to $648.73 per unit.I guess if you buy 100 of them it will come out to $3,000 per unit.I thought the purpose of these bulk packs was to enable bulk users to save money???Go figure."
1,No Lid,"This mug seems okay, but it arrived with out a lid. I checked to see who the seller was and it appears to be amazon. I'm very disappointed. Packing wise, they appeared to just throw it in a box with some of the plastic bubbles, no attention to detail. If some one was paying attention, maybe the mug would have a lid."
3,American Expedition 24-Ounce Thermal Mug,"It's really a beautiful mug, but it doesn't seem to keep the ice long enough. Maybe I'm expecting too much of the product."
5,great,"Great size, beautiful pic, keeps liquid hot and cold, great gift for wolf lover. I'm buying two more!"
3,Very interesting and intriguing!,"I originally just got this book because it was thin and about war for my English assignment. 2 chapters into it I was hooked and it is one of the best war stories I have ever read! Coming from a 16 year old, I think this book is a must read!"
2,Can't Miss Stapler still misses.,This stapler is advertised as one which never fails. Every staple is supposed to do its thing every time. Perhaps some models of the stapler live up to their reputation. This one does not. I plan to donate it to Goodwill.
4,Water Gardens,A great reference for the home gardener. Very clear color pictures tospark ideas for your water feature.
4,Great study read for promotional testing,This is a must read for those studying for promotional exam.
3,Review of Visioneer Strobe XP 100 Sheet Feed Scanner,It is very portable and very useful for a person wants to carry while on the road. it is reasonably fast in Gray and Black white mode. Color can be slow and noisy. The sheet should be properly fed if not the scanning image will not be straight. Image is not perfectly straight most of the times. Soft ware of Paperport is very good has very useful feature in Folder management. Lacks the preview of image before scanning as it is possible in Flat bed. Of course it is not possible to preview and scan with any sheet feed scanner Wish price could be less than $100 for this product. The current price of $179.00 is a bit high.
2,A downgrade from previous sheetfeed scanners,"This scanner is slow, does not scan larger than 11 inch long paper (the previous scanners went up to 30'), and is simply not as friendly. I'm selling my XP 100 and reinstalling my strobe NT. The plus is that paperport software is excellent for going paperless, and the XP 100 is lighter and smaller than previous. Good for carrying with your notebook for faxing. If you don't have a notebook do yourself a favor and buy a Strobe NT. It works fine with win XP once the updated drivers are loaded."
1,Pissed,"Visioneer did an excellent job taking my money and giving me nothing in return. The software is extreamly unflexable(proprietary format, automation is faulty, very few useful settings). The scanner itself never worked properly. It cuts of pages too soon, no mater how many times it was calibrated, the pages twist as they go through sometimes, the switch to make it scan doesnt always work, it doesnt grab the paper evenly, etc.On top of all this, they have NO customer support. They dont even exist beyond their website. I have tried to email and call any number i can with no luck.Avoid all Visioneer products!"
1,Piece of garbage,"This is my second Visioneer scanner in three months. Bought the Road Warrior, installed it, worked fine. (I agree with the warnings about difficulty in aligning pages to scan.) Then it stopped working. Scans totally black. Uninstalled, reinstalled, etc. Still dead.So I bought this one (XP100), because I was leaving for a one year overseas trip, and needed it immediately. Yes, I must be a glutton for punishment.Same deal. Installed, worked fine. I must print, sign and scan docs twice a week. First time I tried to use it on the road, it was totally dead. Got a nice tech guy at a college where my kids are training to help, he got it working once. Next time I booted, dead again.I will never, never buy Visioneer again. I'm now looking on Amazon for a robust portable scanner to have Fedexed to me overseas by my U. S. office, from another vendor."
1,Poor Product and Poor Service,"This product worked for about a month when I had to re-image my computer so I went ahead and had the disk sent to me (cost me money) and then they sent the calibration sheets to me (cost me money) and then they told me they sent me the wrong disk and they would have to send me the right one (and get this - they charged me for the second disc as well). What a lousy company to do business with. Unlike most companies that provide computer related equipment, you can't download the software from their website. You have to have them send you the disk and, as mentioned above, they charge you for it. If you eenjoy being very frustrated with poorly trained customer service people and customer service people that reap some sort of joy out of pissing you off, then go ahead and buy it. If not, buy a product from their competitor!!"
1,does not even earn one star.,"this product, just like some other visioneer product, is WORTHLESS, because it is unstable. Sometimes it works just fine, other times does not work. terrible support. they do not even have 1800 number listed on their websites and they close at 4:00 pst."
1,WARNING,I BOUGHT THE STROBE PRO LAST YEAR. MY WARNING IS THAT VISIONEER DOESN'T SEEM TO FEEL THAT SUPPORTING ITS PRODUCTS AFTER ONE YEAR IS IMPORTANT. THEY JUST COME OUT WITH A NEW MODEL AND EXPECT YOU TO BUY THAT. THE STROBE PRO NEVER REALLY WORKED WITH WINDOWS 2000 OR XP (THUS THE NEWER MODEL). ON TOP OF THAT THE FUNCTIONALITY AND QUALITY OF ITS SCANS IS POOR. I WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMEND AGAINST BUYING THESE PRODUCTS.
1,Don't quit smoking and attempt to use a visioneer product at the same time!,"What a piece of garbage.I bought this scanner and installed it on my computer only to get black pages of paper. I used visioneer's troubleshooting site to ""quick"" unistall and reinstall the software and scanner driver after having to manually edit my registry and use some special uninstall software they published and after three attempts I continued to get black page scans. I have attempted the installation on three different computers. The first one resulted in these black pages, the second resulted in fatal installation (never worked), and the third computer--a brand new Dell resulted in the scanner functioning ONE TIME. After a re-boot, I got the same black pages...I don't have this scanner anymore. I recently quit smoking and smashed the thing on my marble kitchen counter this morning.I recommend if you are going through the whole quitting smoking process, you avoid Visioneer products."
1,I'm a disbeliever now too,"I read the previous reviews, didn't believe it, and now have a non-functioning scanner. Buy something else."
3,Two fine tracks,"The first album, Sold Am, will always remean classic, this one only contains two pearls: Rapid city and Jews like Jesus."
2,Ugh!,"This movie was just awful!The acting was horrible; the plot & characters were undeveloped.The only redeeming quality of this movie is the setting - Chippewa Lake Park was a great place, both before and after it closed in 1976. The movie is worth a watch ONLY because of the setting. It's too bad something more worthwhile could not have been filmed there before the park was completely torn down."
4,Loved it!,"Great movie for roller coaster/amusement park fans! Being shot at the closed for 30+ years Chippewa Park makes it awesome. Very good footage of the park including the remaining rides that closed with the park back in 1978! The scenery couldn't be better for a horror movie set in an abandonned amusement park. The story is good although a little confusing and the music by the producer is awesome! Actor Joe Unger as ""the carny"" is in my opinion just amazing. Also the DVD has special features including a 2008 scout to Chippewa before shooting the movie and a 1993 documentary of Chippewa. Totally worth watching it!"
3,Great location...,"I bought this movie based on just the filming location alone. The movie as far as acting, plot and CG left a little to be desired but the location was great. The documentaries in the bonus features of the disc and scenery in the film made it worth the money for me. If your interested in Chippewa Lake Park then this is for you, but if your looking for a blockbuster scary movie then you better keep looking."
4,Closed for the Season,"I was plesently surprised with the film. I bought it mainly for the fact that is was shot at the park where I went as a child. It brought back some memories for me, and had a half-way decent story line."
1,PRAY IT NEVER RE-OPENS,"I rarely give up and take a DVD out of the player before it ends, but CLOSED FOR THE SEASON is one exception.After an hour of sheer boredom and frustration, my patience evaporated.Every aspect of this movie is insufferably bad, from the script to the acting.Avoid this loser at all costs. NO STARS!!"
2,BEST artwork i have EVER seen on a movie.,"Okay, I am a Carnival addict. I Love going to carnivals, i have since i was a little kid. I Know everything about ANY carnival ride, and Every rides manufacturer. Obsessed much?!?! lol! And i LOVE Horror Movies. I Was in my video store the other day, and i seen this an i was like..OMFGGG.... This is the PERFECT combination for me. So, i imidiatally HAD to get it. I put it in, as soon as i got home. I Wanted to Love this SOOOO MUCH. Unfortunatally, i didn't. The Movie doesn't make a lick of sense. I was confused throughout the whole movie. Some parts, were so dumb, they were actually HILARIOUS. Everytime something happened in this movie, it turned out to be a vision they were having. It is ASHAME, that someone, would ruin a movie, that had so much potential. The Artwork is FABOLOUS!! That's the only reason this movie gets Two Stars. The Movie itself, 1 STAR. Please...RE MAKE this movie. Please."
4,Intrigue and violence,"An excellent story. On the surface it is about intrigue, terrorism, espionage, and violence. But it has a multitude of psychological themes in there too.I had to read it slowly, but as usual, Conrad has fascinating ideas hidden in there.It is inspired by a real event, which I suggest you leave reading about it until after you have read the novel: [...]"
2,While Acclaimed by Many . . .,"While acclaimed by many, The Secret Agent does not seem to me to be Conrad at his best. If you want him at his best, read the stories of the sea or stories taking place in exotic locales -- Nostromo, Almayer's Folly, Youth, Lord Jim or others with similar settings."
2,I like the old version better!,"I was surprised to see a new version of this game. I bought this game so that we could play it on Thanksgiving day. The words on this new version seem harder than what I remember on the old version. Also, I just do not like the electronic timer. I am returning my new game, and I plan to buy the old version."
1,Please bring back the original!,"This used to be one of my favorite party games. Then, someone had the not-so-brilliant idea of making it electronic. First of all, it didn't work. You could hit the bar multiple times and get no score at all. The loud buzzers and ticking was extremely annoying. If I can find an original version of this game, I will buy it, and I would recommend that original game to anyone, but this game? A piece of junk!"
1,Damage,Corner of book was badly wrinkled/damaged. Inside cover had writing all over it in pen. Not impressed with this purchase.
2,Not very fun to read,"My son likes this book fine but I don't enjoy reading it very much. When there's so many Halloween books that we both like to read (ex. Halloween Night, Room on the Broom), I don't see any reason to keep this one around."
5,This one is for everybody not just the patient!,"This is the first book I have seen that talks to everybody in the family dealing with a loved ones transplant. All the feelings, good and bad are there. Anyone who knows someone going through or is the person going through a transplant should read this book. Personal stories are everywhere throughout the text. Tips about insurance, location, hopes, fears, what to expect, what wasn't expected, and a whole lot more. Questions to ask and who to ask, as well as questions you don't want to ask but will feel better knowing those thoughts running through your head aren't only your's. All the important authorities to know are contributors to this text. There are even movie suggestions while you are waiting, and waiting, and ......"
2,Hitler definitely died in the bunker...,"Musmanno was on the American committee to determine whether or not Hitler survived the war, hence his access to so many ex Nazis. The transcripts of the interviews that he used to write the book are available online through Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, PA (where his papers are). The link is:[...]"
3,Book,"It's a book. It's a good study for the mob in NY from how it started, how it operated and how law enforcement brought operations down and how the laws changed."
1,Not a how-to book,"This book would be better titled ""Loving School"" because it primarily addresses how to connect with your loved one. If you are looking for advice on how to be a better kisser and technique, this book does not serve the purpose."
2,Waste of Time,"If you are looking for a book that gives you technical explanations of how to improve your kissing skills, this is NOT the book. There is almost no discussion of the mechanics of kissing at all. What this book is, is a metaphysical approach to connectedness...basically, if you aren't at a place of inner-peace and connectedness with yourself, you can't share that with someone else. This book is a whole lot of ethereal fluff...and I tend to like ethereal, but not when I want real guidance. I was very disappointed and actually returned it. It wasn't even worth keeping around."
4,Love the mugs!,Bought these to round out some missing items in my inventory of Christmas china. Have collected the Spode Christmas tree pattern for years; these are exactly what I needed at a much better rate than is available retail.
1,Words for the sake of words...,"Someone got a new thesaurus for her birthday when she wrote this book, and didn't go to the trouble of engaging an editor. The book could be half as long and just as descriptive by omitting all the superfluous (and in many cases, just plain wrong)vocabulary.For example, in the first few pages I found ""interception into"" used where ""insertion"" would have been the appropriate term; ""Speckled with many hours""; ""GE truck"" (Maybe a typo, should have been GM); and ""robins and crows that cawed and chirped"" (descriptive, if backwards).The author packs so much angst into her limited years, and what is supposed to be an autobiographical memoir is reduced to a self-indulgent farce. Maybe the tale is truthful, but it isn't believable.If a screenplay ever does come of this, let us hope it goes straight to video."
2,Not really true?,"Not necessary alll you read in the sample pages is true. There must have been some creative genius to write such terrific ideas. Although great ideas, lack of sensibility and realism, makes this book below average. Check it out for your self, you decide."
3,"Loving God, Charles Colson","I'm reading all the Charles Colson books I can get my hands on! Here is an evangelical Christian that didn't sit on his hands! And, the background was well documented. Besides, I ENJOYED reading it; every Christian should read it. The reading was especially enjoyable on my Kindle! They have more titles at Amazon that I want to put on my ""wish list""!"
5,A treasury of Christian thought.,"Chuck Colson's book about loving God is a welcome return to the essentials of Christian living. In a day where Christian thought centers around the individual and not Christ, this book calls us back to the richness and meaningfulness of what it really means to love God.Colson's assertion that loving God means obeying Him is not new, just forgotten in today's selfish, inward turning church. Loving God for who He is rather than what we want Him to do for us shakes us out of the shallow pool of self absorption that the current personal potential message of the church today selfishly embraces. It reminds us of the enormous sacrifice of Christ and its true meaning for our lives today.As we become aware of the depth and reach of God's love for us, and our appropriate response to that love with a genuine love of our own, we enter into the new life promised by Jesus and His apostles. It is the difference between Christian Lite and true fulfillment as a mature child of God."
5,I love this book.,"As a Christian, I love to read about the way God works through the life's of others to reach others. This is a book you will remember and recall these stories years after,as food for your soul."
2,Oh if it was only a Phone call......,"Good Lawd did it drag on like talking to a relative that wont shut up long enough to just get to the Hanging Up. Oh man what a snore bore! Hollywood had the nerve to lable this a comedy ? Bad Drama at best!No doubt a steller cast but no script,no direction....No Point ! Here is a hint if you watch this. Take a clock or a watch,And count how many times that you look at it. No kidding, That BAD.Meg Ryan can only be so cute,Kudrow can only whine so much. And I swear when will Diane Keaton give up that one Womans lib suitshes been wearing for the past twenty years.3 sistersdivorced mom and dad,Hurts,Healing,Life.....But my gosh somebody had to of yawned before it left the cutting room !I sure hope their checks cashed, Because they sure didnt get paid by box office ticket sales.MISS AT ALL COSTS!"
1,Could this Be any worse?,"This has got to be one of the biggest wastes of talent i've ever seen next to ""Sphere."" I would have expected more from Walter Matthau, Diane Keaton, and Lisa Kudrow. I'm sure that the people responsible for this figured everyone would be crying their eyes out at such a heartfelt movie. Bollocks to that! I sat through this trite not feeling anything for these one-dimensional characters. Every scene and event felt so fake. But of course, we, as the completely dumb moviegoing audience, are just supposed to sit back and be spoonfed this garbage until the predictably obnoxious food-fight (or flour-fight or whatever) that serves as its resolution comes at the end. Please, for your own sake, stay away from this movie. Agree? Disagree?"
1,Don't Bother,"This was probably on e of the worst movies I've seen in a long while.You'd think with the great cast (which was the only thing that got me to the end) it might have a chance, but no, it was just anoying.Too bad."
1,Why do movies like this get made?,"I rented this movie because I thought my wife would like it and we were both disappointed. I don't understand movies like this. You have incredible star power yet no signicant plot or conflict.The obvious premise is that Meg Ryan leads a hectic life trying to care for her dad and keep her sisters informed all the while hating her sisters for not caring enough and feeling sorry for herself.After about 20 minutes of Meg Ryan going nuts on the phone trying to talk to people, I wanted a line to form like it did in the movie ""Airplane!"" where people slap her around a little and tell her to get a hold of herself.I guess the big conflict is will the two sisters of Meg care enough to come and see their father and will Meg ever calm down. I guess they do at the end but you will never care enough for the characters to care about the movie. It is a shame that Walter Matthau wasted one of his last roles in this pointless movie."
1,Hang up on this movie!,"This movie has all the annoying qualities of a Woody Allen movie without any of the laughs. I bought it, I saw it, I sold it IMMEDIATELY on half.com!"
1,"Hang Up, Disconnect, and Change Your Number!","Movie Summary: Eve's drunk of a father is dying. Her estranged mother couldn't care less and her two self absorbed sisters aren't much help.My Opinion: This is a stinker of a movie. It is misconceived right from the start. Is it a comedy or is it a drama? It's not very funny, and there is nothing redeeming to the drama. There is nothing in this movie to justify watching it through to the end. They could have done a lot with the three sisters but it wasn't about three sisters. It was about the middle daughter and her alcoholic father. This just isn't entertainment. It would be more accurate if we called it something different like ""punishment for traffic offenders"".DVD Quality: Widescreen anamorphic with a deleted scene and a gag reel that is better than the movie.What You Should Do: Steer clear. Do not spend any time on this film much less any money."
1,hated it!,"We rented this thinking it would be a comedy. The trailers led us to believe that it would be. Furthermore, we found the characters of the sisters to be annoying. This movie was just plain depressing."
1,"Lisa Kudrow, oh please! Phoebe Buffet kills this one.","This film may have had a fighting chance given the enormous talent behind it. From a strong stable of actors to a top notch crew with regard to writing and production. The casting director was the lone assasin when they decide to plop Lisa Kudrow in the midst of actual actors. Kudrow's performance was so bad that she ends up on the editing room floor for major segments of the film, but sadly, not often enough. I believe the film's writers may have even snuck a cryptic apology to the audience when in one scene they actually have Kudrow's character complain, ""Nobody takes me seriously as an actress!""This film certainly could have soared higher without the Phoebe Buffet stinking the place up. Kudrow may be passable on ""Friends"", but certainly cannot perform with any more depth than we've already seen on sitcom TV. She's bloody awful."
1,Throwing Up,"That's what the title for this movie should have been. I'm going to complain that the Rental place I rented it from, didn't have a warning sign in front of this movie! I loved Sleepless & You've Got Mail, but this movie was flat, boring, went nowhere and it's characters were entirely un-relateable! What a Joke! Hey, here's an idea, why not include an actual profound thought in your movie? Or maybe something you don't see coming an astronomical unit away! I'm actually ashamed I rented it. I don't understand how anyone can actually like this movie. Maybe they're in denial.You've been warned!"
1,stupid is as stupid does,"Please, this movie was so stupid and boring I want my 3 dollars for renting this ridiculous movie. Good actors but pittiful plot"
2,not very good,When I first saw previews for this movie I thought it was going to be very funny but it wasnt. I am a big Walter Mattheau fan and he wasnt very funny in it. The movie is mostly sad and boring. I was disappointed in it. So I give it two stars.
3,Drama--Not Comedy,"It's now strange to see Meg Ryan outside her usual genre--the romantic comedy. This movie is a touching drama of an ailing parent and his three daughters. I think the reason so many people were disappointed with this film is because it was advertised as a comedy. Though the main theme is sad, the film also has comic touches. Overall though I don't believe this could be called a comedy. Good acting was turned in by all. Well worth seeing at least once."
3,"Good, not great","This movie is not at all what I expected. Yes, Meg Ryan, Diane Keaton and Lisa Kudrow are great actresses, and they're the ones that make the film work.Eve (Ryan), unlike Maddy (Kudrow) and Georgia (Keaton), is often worried about her father's (Walter Matthau) health, and she devotes the majority of her time to him. Maddy and Georgia take their father for granted, except for Eve. But in the midst of their father's failing health, the three sisters reestablish their relationship.This movie is not a comedy -- there are more dramatic moments than funny ones. But I still think it's worth watching. Ryan, Keaton and Kudrow are a great trio, even in a mediocre film like this one."
2,Very Average,Aside From Meg Ryan Who Else Really Got into this Movie?one would think with Walter Matthau that the Film Would have had a Few More Laughs but it doesn't even come close.Diane Keaton Really Doesn't do much for the film same goes for Lisa Kudrow.this Film Takes on More issues without Solving Anything.A Good Idea that gets Buried real Fast.
1,"absolut awful, the worst movie I ever bought!","I love movies with diane keaton normally, but this movie is so awful, at the end I didn't know, what it was about!"
4,It's not that bad!,"Hanging Up has gotten some horrible reviews but I think this film is quite good. Starring Meg Ryan, Lisa Kudrow, and Diane Keaton who also directs this film, is the story of three sisters who are very different from each other but unite and ultimately let go of some old age resentment through their father's illness. Ryan owns this film, she carries every scene and I think her dramatic side as an actress never gets the credit she fully deserves. Some of the scenes are a bit wacky but underneath is a warm and engaging family drama/comedy."
3,Quite Adorable Actually,"I have read the reviews listed here before renting this DVD, and they weren't very good, some people gave this movie one star. But since this movie has two great actresses (Meg Ryan, Lisa Kudrow), I decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed. True, sometimes the drama takes over, and the comedy kind of fades off, but the result is an adorable film, that tends to put a smile upon your face. It's mainly about family relationships, presenting the ties that are put to a test when bad things happen. Meg Ryan has the lead role, and she does it best. This DVD also contains a very entertaining ""gag reel"" with actual bloopers that happened during the shooting. You can absolutely tell that they really enjoyed making this film, which is probably why I enjoyed watching it, although it doesn't have a cut-edge story, or holding your tummy kind of laughs."
4,Theology based more on the Bible than on the writings of Philosophers,Theology based more on the Bible than on the writings of Philosophers. This book is easy for a layman to read.
3,Doesn't function the way it says it supposed to.,"this product does cool the ps3 like it says, but the thermosensors do not function. They are supposed to shut the unit down when it gets cooled down.So far it hasn't done so and i've left it on for hours. As long as you don't mind shutting it on and off every time you use it, it works fine."
1,Waste of time and Money,"Based on 40 gig system.Does not fit or even function with temp sensor location. May even cause incorrect cooling of system. As designed attempts to draw air from inside PS3, where it fits is an intake not exhaust on 40 gig sys. Had to modify Cooler even to get it to set anywhere near enough to function. Disassembled Cooler, relocated temp sensor and reversed fan directions to pump additional air into intake. Seemed to help somewhat (more exhaust air flow) but then was so noisy as to be distracting. Unit will either be on Ebay or disassembled for parts.Cost of learning experience ... $27.00, Value of listening to Amazon reviewers..... Priceless!!"
1,Not compatible,"This purchase was a total waste of my money and time. It did NOT say it wasnt compatible with a 40G playstation, neither in the description, nor in the pictures, or even on the box once I received it! And better yet, if I am to return it I have to pay approximately $10 for shipping AND the restocking fee. Like I said, total waste of money and time for me. Oh, and I received it on one of the last expected shipping dates. yay."
1,Does not fit on PS3 40 bg version,This cooler does not fit on PS3 40 gb version. Sellers must specify that. I bought one and it does not fit on my PS3.
5,The best book on this subject!!,"My local TV news did a show on small businesses to start and mentioned starting an Errand service. I purchased a few books on starting this business and this is, by far, the best!! It has everything - startup tips, marketing tips, and ideas, ideas, and more ideas. Good stuff. Another Amazon reviewer said it didn't have pricing information. Well, I don't know what book they were reading, because this one has more information than any other book I've seen. I started my business six months ago, I'm doing very well, and I have this book to thank. I refer to it all the time. Good luck to you as well!"
2,How to Start and Operate and Errand Service,You'd be better off buying a general book on how to start your own business. Then supplement this by researching errand services that are already operating in your area to determine pricing and services. Basic business concepts and a little market research are more helpful. The book does give good ideas for niche marketing though.
2,Plastic Comb?,"I received this ""book"" -- wait, no, it's a BOOKLET -- and I was shocked. I couldn't believe I paid $25 for a comb bound booklet. It's not even printed double sided. Furthermore, I'm not impressed with the content. The information is readily available in other books such as Entrepreneur Magazine's How to Start a Personal Concierge Service or The Concierge Manual, Second Edition. This booklet should have been a download rather than a shipped ""book"". It's certainly not worth $25. I'm sure there was something in the description about comb binding, but I missed it (perhaps I expected different from Amazon). I was a little more than disappointed."
4,"Errands...for people, children or even pets.",You must like people and doing things for others. Good information. It is a good book to get the knowledge of what is to be done and what is needed. It is best to get all the information you can on a subject. One must always be honest and trustworthy. A good worker is a good reference to someone else.
1,Deplorable,"This is, without a doubt, the worst investment I have made so far. The grammar and punctuation is deplorable, and the information is next to useless. There are infinitely better sources for anyone looking for information on how to start a small business. I would have given it a rating of less than one star had one been available. Save your time and money."
1,If I could give it no stars I would,"Listen to the people who wrote this off as a waste of money - they were right!! I, unfortunately, did not and feel totally ripped off. Very basic generic information about starting up a small business - in the pricing area - which was an area I was really seeking guidance in his summary was ""use your own judgement"" boy I really needed a $25.00 poorly put-together, poorly edited notebook to tell me that... DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY"
5,Insightful information about a little-known business,"I enjoyed reading this refreshing text and found it to be replete with pertinent information about creating, running, and maintaining an errand service business. The author provides helpful insights gleaned from his experiences in and knowledge of the business and writes in a straightforward, no-nonsense, and practical style. I would recommend this book to anyone who is considering venturing into the errand service business."
2,Fun but cheaply made.,"The concept is the same as the original but the quality is awful. First, it doesn't fit into the box when you put together, so you must disassemble it every time you play. The game falls apart sometimes when playing and the balls dent easily. The balls call fit through the opening on the side so you cannot leave the game assembled. My kids really enjoy playing it until the frustration of continually putting it back together kills the fun. What a shame! A non electronic game that the kids find fun, has to made so poorly."
1,Can't play it at all,"After reading other reviews I was prepared to have to tape this up to keep it together after playing. But, there is obvioulsy no consistency in this product, because others are able to play it long enough to have it fall apart.We can't even do that much.In fact, this succeeds so well at NOT working, that I can't even fathom it being tested by ANYONE before being boxed up and shipped out.No matter who tries...the three year old or my husband...no one can get the balls to launch at all. If we can get them an inch off the base it is an acheivement.Hit it soft....nuttin.Hit it hard...nuttin.Hit is SUPER hard to the point you are sure you are going to break it and your hand...maybe it will pop up a bit.No child can do this.Really pathetic."
1,Awful - no stars,"I don't write reviews, but this toy is so bad I just had to warn all others. We could not get one ball through the hole.....yes.....the chinese can screw up a simple piece of plastic. The ball shoots straight up in the air with no hope of ever going through the holes.What a waste of energy to produce and ship across the ocean"
1,Not the original! Looks like it - but not what you remember!,We bought this for my daughters for Christmas based on my own childhood memories. Couldn't get one ball through the holes after way too much smashing. Holes are either too high or the paddles are angled incorrectly. The only thing they did in making this overseas is ruin a once fun toy. Sorry Fundex! Try harder a little harder to get the design closer to the original - this gets a Fundex score of zero.
4,"Not sturdy, but fun! And tape fixes its problems for good","The reviews that state that Grip Gnop falls apart are completely true. But I came up with a perfect and easy fix. I put it together and then reinforced all of the seams with clear shipping tape. You can't really see the tape, so it doesn't look horrendous or block your view of the game.I did this six months ago, and it's still together. We haven't had to redo the tape or had any part of it fall apart. And we use it a lot!It's a fun game and not as easy as it looks. There actually is a bit of a skill kids develop learning not to just bang on them mercilessly. If they get the right ""touch,"" they get the balls in faster. But other than that, not much educational value except learning the concept of competition without having to commit to a long game of something like Candyland. Good, simple fun. I loved this as a kid and am glad they brought it back."
4,Family Fun,"I got this toy for my children many years ago (30?), and they loved it. So did Grandma, Aunts, Uncles, Mom and Dad. This year I decided to buy some toys for the adults' entertainment since we don't have any small children in our family at this time. I had a visual of ""Grandma"" playing this game, so I started looking for it and found it on Amazon.com. So, we all became children again, and Grandma (now 83) had so much fun beating everyone.... and beating Grandma was ""THE"" challenge for everyone. We're organizing a Gnip Gnop tournament for our next family get-together.PS: If you want a quiet toy, don't buy this one. If you want noise, lots of cheering, clapping, booing, jumping up and down...this might be the toy for you."
1,Great for 5 minutes until it falls apart,I remember this toy from my youth and ordered it for my kids. I don't recall the toy that I played with being so flimsy. I would not buy it again and wouldn't recommend it unless you wanted to put the top back on after every round of play. It's a fun killer.
3,Old School Game!,I used to play this game when I was a kid...Bought it for my 7 & 9 yr. old boys...Fun to play...Easy to assemble...:)
3,cool game,"The game can be hard for kids but once you get the hang of it, it is fun. My boys can't play it as well as my husband and I can because you really have to hit the keys hard to fling the balls right."
1,JUNK,You have to absolutly smash the buttons as hard as you can to get the balls through the holes. Complete junk. Don't even consider this one.
4,Lots o' fun for mom & 4-yr-old son,"I remember this game from my youth, and am delighted that my son and I can play it together without one of us consistently winning (I go a little slower at times to give him a chance, but other times he beats me without ""help""). A little noisy and not as sturdy as I recall, but we can play several games without him tiring of it. It's a good value considering the length of our sessions with it."
2,Not the same quality as when I was a kid,"Remembering Gnip Gnop from my childhood, I bought one for my kids this year. The game play is the same, but the game is smaller and the constuction quality is completely insufficient for a game that has kids pounding paddles as quickly as they can.The game falls apart regularly. When it does, the balls can escape the play-field, so of course they get lost. This is a fundamental design problem, not something specific to my copy. I would try gluing the whole thing together, but with the pounding the game takes, I doubt the glue would hold.Avoid this product, or buy with the knowledge that it has a usable lifespan measured in weeks."
3,Gnip-Gnop: The Remake,"My husband and I so enjoyed this game as children that we decided to purchase one for our daughters, ages 10 and 7. It is definitely not as durable as the original. It's very easy to put together yet it can come apart during normal play. To the point we have to put pieces back in place between games or either hold pieces in place during actual play. A little frustrating; however, my daughter absolutely love the game. I guess since they never played the original version from the 70s they have nothing to compare it to. I would still purchase it again but would not it expect it to last for the long haul."
5,Excellent. From an ex Brit soldier.,"Having served with the British Army, I found this book compelling reading, I also read Bravo Two Zero. this is also an excellent book. From my own experience I know these stories are true. Including the one about the drug cartels."
4,Good Life Stories,"My first encounter with Mr. McNab was with ""Bravo Two Zero"" about being imprisoned by Iraq during the Gulf War. This is a great follow up book that looks into his entire life from childhood through his service with the SAS. The book as a whole is very entertaining because of the tone Mr. McNab takes (dry British humor). He talks in great length about 'selection' in the SAS and his battles with the IRA and also how he ended up on the path to a military career. Mr. McNab has great life experiences and he does not dissappoint in delivering them to the reader in this book. This is a must-read for those interested in reading about the personalities and individual experiences of those in elite fighting forces."
5,Inside the Regiment.,"Immediate Action by Andy McNab is not so much about missions as it is about men. It tells the story of how McNab became a member of the Regiment and just what it takes to get in. Like Bravo Two Zero, it is the honesty that grips you, as McNab relates everyday events, tragic mishaps and the hilarious antics of men too big, too strong and too smart to be kept inactive or in one place for very long. Missions are recounted with wins and losses, but it is the men in the story that you remember. This is one of those books that stays with you long after you've finished reading it."
4,It's good,"This was a pretty good book for just about anybody. For those who are used to military life (i.e. in the military, a dependent or just friends with one) then you will see a lot you already recognize. For everyone else, this truly shows what the military in any country trains for, how they train for it and how they deal with it. This book stresses that what the public see's on the screen is not so in real life. Good book =)"
4,Inside look at the life of a special operations soldier,"Great book that takes you through Andy McNab's youth to the beginning of Desert Shield/Storm and the ""Bravo Two Zero"" story.Gives you an inside look at the life of a special operations soldier, similar in style and content to ""Inside Delta Force"" by Eric Haney.Some of the stories feel a little disjointed and nothing in the book supports the claim on the dust jacket that McNab is ""one of the most highly decorated soldiers alive.""Easier to read than ""Bravo Two Zero"" but not quite as exciting."
4,"A must to read, a good backgroung for B2Z","This is the second McNab book, detailing his life in the SAS pre Gulf War. It gives a good in sight to the Man (and the men) of the SAS. There are some good cross references to other books written be McNab's contemporaries. This is a very good autobiographical work, captivating, informative and a damn good read but wait until you read his fist work of fiction 'REMOTE CONTROL' that'll just blow you away..."
3,How Andy McNab got started in the SAS.,"Not as exciting as Bravo Two Zero. Anticlimactic ending, but this is real life. Buy the paperback and save"
2,NO immediate action,"I loved Bravo Two Zero, and similar books like Black Hawk Down, but despite the name of this book there is in fact very little action. Unfortunately all the flatly delivered domestic reminiscences just enforce the view of squaddies being self-centred little boys who prefer to play with their toys than deal with ""normal"" life. The only mission that any detail (action) is given is the cocaine plant destruction at the end of the book. After Bravo Two Zero this is a damp squib."
2,Not so good,I looked forward to reading this because of Bravo Two Zero. This leaves much to be desired. I think he wrote this one second to capitalize in on the fame that two zero brought him. This book is OK at best.
3,Good intro to McNab,"Fair insight into life in the SAS and the training, could have been a little more personel and a deeper look at the man himself."
3,Never Too Old,"Bought the battery for the GutWrencher for a friend of mine (69 years old)...He's still a kid at heart and enjoyed the toy...says ""it really goes fast""."
1,will the REAL Clapton please stand up,"What is goin' on here? Thank God, I did not buy this pitiful attempt of music. My poor friend did buy it and asked me to listen, I told him it might serve better as a coaster for his beer glass so his wife doesn't get upset for leaving rings on the furniture. What is Clapton doing? I believe in the past ten yrs he has been steeped in banality, but this offering is horrific. Please listen to The Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton for a true understanding of this man's brilliance. Layla for some of his best songwriting and vocal phrasings. I never thought I could ever think this,let alone express it, but Mr. Clapton PLEASE put away your guitar until you once again discover inspiration, you are embarrassing yourself and tarnishing your legacy. It breaks my heart to make these comments, but at least my friend's wife will be happy. Peace."
2,"Too laid back, too commercial","Lets face it you purchase a Clapton CD to hear him rip away with some blues, but alas on this CD he tries to do much and that leads him astray from his roots. The result is a big dissappointment. I would much rather have had a CD come out of the Crossroads Guitar Festival (DVD) then this and I am really looking forward to the Cream reunion CD that is scheduled to come out next month. Skip this CD and buy just the good songs on iTunes"
2,This is an odd album for an EC recording.,"While listening to this CD it becomes obvious that Mr Clapton is in a much happier place these days, and I'm honestly happy about that. Though that can influence some guys to write great music it seems to not be the case with this one, at this point in time.I bought this without hearing it first, a major no-no of mine for obvious reasons, and once again I have been taught why that's never a good idea.If you've enjoyed bluesy, guitar heavy tunes of Eric's in the past, you won't find even one of them here. The guitar work is mixed in there somewhere but only rarely does it stand out.In my humble opinion, with the exception of the first song, the entire thing, well... stinks. I wish him the best with it though. Maybe it'll strike a chord with somebody else."
2,Disappointing.,"A few decent tracks such as George Harrison's ""Love Comes to Everyone"", however for the most part EC sings to sub standard R&B ballads, which may work for some, but not for slowhand. In addition, the first track slowly ends with a baby crying. Back Home is a long way from 461 Ocean Blvd. Eric you can do better than this!!!!!"
2,This breaks my heart......,"It breaks my heart to say this, because Eric Clapton is, in my opinion, the greatest living guitarist.........but........I didn't really like Back Home. There, I said it. A Clapton comeback would be great, and the album has a few promising guitar solos, but Eric just sounds so BORED throughout the whole thing. Sure, the opening track is fresh and cool, One Track Mind has a nice solo ( for about 3 seconds), and the reggae-tinged Revolution borders on mildly interesting, but still, Clapton is out of place on an album I was so looking forward to."
1,"Quite frankly, this is horrible!","What is the joke? How are coffee and Eric Clpaton alike? They both suck without cream. Well, I don't go that far. Eric has made some really great albums, primarily/exclusively in the 1970s, but still. This album is such watered down claptrap that it is impossible to listen to without getting ill, primarily because the man behind this music is so talented and capable of so much more. Does Clapton have a really great solo album left in him? I hope so."
5,Clapton utopia,I think this album features some of the best music he has ever done. It has a smooth sound - smooth blues. I would like to see more music produced like this.
4,Good Album-Great High Resolution Audio,"3 stars for the album and 4 1/2 for the DVD side high resolution audio. Not one of Eric's best efforts, but a very comforting album mostly dedicated to the songwriters he admires most over the years and to his family. If you're a Clapton fan (and have learned not to expect too much), you'll enjoy it. I bought the DualDisc version and am very impressed with the audio quality on the DVD side which for once is in real DVD-Audio (both 2 channel & 5.1 surround) using 24 bit sampled at 48khz. This is so welcome since most DVD sides on DualDiscs only provide Dolby Digital sound which is way too compressed."
2,Why would anyone listen to Eric Clapton for easy listening?,"With Back Home, Eric Clapton has released an easy listening album. The question is, why would anyone listen to Eric Clapton for sappy pop music? His talent is his guitar, not his voice - if I wanted pop, I would listen to Paul McCartney. Eric's voice is okay, but not great, and while there are a few decent guitar riffs here, it doesn't compare to his better CDs in any way.I know that Clapton has nothing against pop. He's played with every one of the Beatles at concerts, and is featured on George Harrison's solo albums with George and Ringo. However, he can't sing a pop song like George can, and on this CD he doesn't play the guitar as well as George and Eric did on their classic collaborations like While my Guitar Gently Weeps and Badge.I hope his next studio CD is a Cream re-union album like the recent Cream re-union concert. Perhaps going back to playing the guitar while Jack Bruce sings and plays bass will get him out of this rut."
3,Middle of the Road,"Eric Clapton's new CD is not Eric Clapton. That's as plain as I can say it. The majority of the cuts are lilting Top-40ish sounding ditties about love and kids and general non-offensive subjects. The few blues sounding cuts have huge organ runs and what sounds like an entire choir backing his vocals. Orchestrated Blues? C'mon. There will probably huge numbers of fans who like this album, but they are NOT Eric Clapton fans. This is purely a generic ""hit"" album.I am not saying EC should not do happy songs, but I did not buy the CD for this ""kinder, gentler"" music. I personally want raw guitar and damnable blues. He is too talented for this pop album. Pure middle of the road."
3,Eric What are you doing!,"I have been a fan for 40 years, I use to see him in the Yardbirds under the Richmond athletic stadium and when Cream started at Windsor and at the Albert Hall many times.He must get back to basics and record ""live"" with a real band and dump protools.He may be happy, but I can tell you that many of his fans are disappointed.He is with out a doubt a master craftsman who can do much better the lyrics are trite and the arrangements just don't cut it.Waiting in hope for good stuff."
2,Snoozefest,"While being a perfectly decent workmanlike little collection of songs, some even written by himself, there is absolutely nothing special about this disc, nothing to recommend it...He is, for quite obvious reasons, a guitar icon, so you always have to tune in, just in case...but this, I'm afraid, is not going to be the one to break the somnambulistic spell cast by so many of his recent efforts..."
1,"Oh, bother!","Has the man who blistered our ears with Mayall and Cream (both the original and the recent reunion shows), who stood toe-to-toe with Duane, who shared the spotlight with the lesser-known-but-perhaps-more-talented Albert Lee and with various authentic bluesmen, and who is capable of so much more than just mailing in stuff like this listless set of elevator music fallen under the spell of a mind controlling cult (has he been seen with Tom Cruise?), surrounded himself with too many ""yes"" men and women, or simply gone over to the bland side, a fate worse than the dark side and a place where rock and blues have been eviscerated by a music industry that shares more than it might imagine with factory farming where animals live short miserable lives cannibalizing the otherwise unusable scraps of their predecessors?"
1,"""God"" is Dead","If you are looking for boring, lifeless adult contemporary music, then this CD is for you. If you are looking for a great guitar CD, this isn't it. I had such high hopes for this CD after the Robert Johnson CDs and the Cream reunion, but all winning streaks must come to an end, and Clapton's comes to a screeching halt with this. Of all the Eric Clapton CDs that I like, this isn't one of them. I'm glad Clapton is now in a happy place (and deservedly so), but this CD just doesn't do it for me."
1,where's the EC?,"I'm a clapton fan because of his blues/rock background. The songs on this albums aren't even good pop songs. I was totally disappointed when I listened to this album because I listened to it objectively. If you didn't know it was Clapton, this CD would not get any 5 star reviews. The EC fan club might enjoy it, but don't buy this album thinking it'll be anything you'd want to listen to more than once."
1,From Robert Johnson to this?,"I really hate to give this record only one star. Like one reviewer just said, eric was coming off the cream reunion and a really good Robert Johnson record and tour, and maybe we were expecting a corner turn in his somewhat laid back studio attempts over the last few years (reptile, pilgrim). This record makes those seem energetic. Lets face it. Eric is a great talent, but people should know where their strenghts lie. Songwriting was never a real strong suit for him. We all know that his strenght lies in his guitar and in his love for the blues. None of these are present on this disc. His tales of domesticity in these tunes are almost downright depressing. I know that people are ''so tired '' when they have kids. Every parent knows already. What we need is to be uplifted. And this record falls way short."
5,Back At It!,"Though I may not have been born when during Clapton's heyday, I am definatley a huge fan. This album, being his first album of new material in 4 years is definatley worth picking up. Clapton covers everything from R+B tunes, to Reggae, to Classic Clapton Blues. Definatley one for fans of the 90's Clapton, though the rest of us can still appreciate it. It is Clapton after all!!I'll see you all on his 2006 World Tour!!"
2,Diet Pop Corn.,"Diet pop corn is the best way to describe this CD. It has nothing sweet sounding, is made from hot air and is corny. It's almost like Clapton is the Saturday morning cartoon version of himself. I understand the song subjects are important to him, but it's tiresome and boring and is not worthy of such a legend. The first song on the disc (So Tired) pretty much sums up the rest of the CD. Either he's tired or just damn lazy. If this were a James Taylor album I would say it's pretty good. But as an Eric Clapton album it blows."
4,clapton's back,"Some people have a problem with Eric Clapton's solo career because he has a habit of releasing lots of uninteresting laid back music. Back Home has a really good song called ""Revolution"" that's groovy and influenced by reggae. It's worth owning for this song alone."
2,Real Average,"Eric Clapton is a Great Guitar Player,but He has been making the same Album over&over&over again.vocally I ain't never really felt Him too much.the songwriting is aight.the Arrangements&overall Musicianship here is real Polished,but is lacking any feeling on a whole.Eric Clapton found a niche a while back&stayed with it&it has worked for him.but it just makes for another run of the mill Album."
2,Oh dear oh dear!,"Schlock, pure schlock. Eric Clapton needs a rabbit out the hat for the next one or he risks being remembered for tripe like this. It's right up there with Reptile and Pilgrim. If he wants to be dumb and happy, great! He deserves to be happy. He should do it in retirement. He's just way too good to be remembered for such mediocre material."
1,It gives me a headache!,"If you wanted something like ""Unplugged"", for goodness sake don't buy this album. It's just not wonderful. I think that I will give it away - if I can find anyone who wants it!"
4,Peacful Easy Clapton,"I never thought I would Write something like This is a Very Nice album about Eric Clapton...However....It really seems as if he has found some Peace and some sense of home and family.As usual there is excellent production and musicianship but as others have noted his guitar playing takes a back seat this go around. Eric has often changed direction, style and challenged himself to bare his feelings, and this album is significant in that it displays where he is as a human being today.The fact that he played again with John Mayall and regrouped with Cream shows that he has come to termes with who and where he is as as a musician, and is not content to just put out expected product. Not for everyone, but great work as usual."
3,Next time...,"I have been listening to Clapton's 2005 album, ""Back Home"" for a while now, and have found some moments that lifted me up. But then there is so much material which makes you wonder if you are listening to the same Clapton we've learned to love and cry to. In spite of the good tracks, ""Back Home"" does Clapton's discography a bit of a disservice. Too bad... I will still be trying, though. A man who has composed and recorded so much legendary music in his life will find his way back into his soul again. He just only partially did it this time around."
1,elevator music,Hey! Everyone even Eric is allowed to make a buck. After listening to this disc that's the conclusion I came to. I can only speak for myself but I don't listen to Eric to hear him sing I listen to hear him play his guitar. The guitar playing is almost non-existent. The mix on the vocals and other instruments drowns him out when he does play. The songs are OK but none of them really stand out. If I could return this disc I would. I know I won't be listening to it. I was glad when I heard Eric was doing something new and not just another pale imitation ofRobert Johnson but this has no bite. I just can't believe that when they listened to this prior to releasing it they thought it was good. I guess I'll just have to listen to the beano album
4,Its a continuation of his music today,"I'll sum all these ""Back Home"" supporters and ney sayers....IF you liked Reptile then you'll like this. I put them in my cd player and play them one after another like a two cd album and it works!! I like them both. Not five stars because a lot of his acoustic and electric guitar work gets drowned out by background singers and production. If you don't have a good stereo system...most people do these days, you'll miss the suttle strings."
2,what decade is it?,"It sounds almost like Clapton woke up in the 70s when he made this album. And not the 70s according to Eric Clapton and Cream, but the lame stereotypical 70s. I love much of his stuff, but this? Not so much."
4,Home is Where the Heart Is......,"Don't expect Ercic Clapton ""guitar god"" on this one. Pick up ""From The Cradle"", ""Journeyman"" etc. if you're looking for that Eric....The Eric on ""Back Home"" returns to the classic ""laid back"" feel displayed on ""461 Ocean Blvd."", ""Slowhand"" etc. This is a catharthic experience for Clapton, and his ""soul cleansing"" comes through in an honest andsoulful way. Listen to ""Say What You Will"" and ""Run Home To Me"", and you'll hear it first hand. There are also some excellent covers of ""Love Comes To Everyone"" (G. Harrison) and""Love Don't Love Nobody"" (Spinners)....Pick this one up and sit back and enjoy your visit to E.C.'s ""home"". You might not want to leave."
3,Not Clapton's Best,"There are some good tacks on Back Home, such as ""One Track Mind"" but it is overall pretty boring and not even close to as good as I expected. I orginally heard revolution and one track mind and thought I might pick up this album, but when I heard the rest, it pretty much put me to sleep."
5,Clapton's best in years.,"its hard to improve on Clapton, but he has managed to out-do himself with this one. The music and the story line of the songs go right ot the heart."
2,not the usual ec,this is not the usual ec album. its all pop music except for one track. there are no good guitar solos. Its all really happy. for the blues fan i would highly recomend that you do not listen to this album. if your a pop fan then you will probaly like this because you like crappy music.this is a horrible cd and whoever told mr. clapton that it was good should be punched in the face.
1,Bland & boring,"This is the musical equivalent of having to look at photos of someone else's kids. It's nice that life has improved for Eric, he's had very rough times in the past so he deserves it, and he obviously loves his children but great music usually comes from hungry, tormented artists. The giveaways: string arrangements, the kiss of death for any hope of edginess in rock, jazz, or blues. Despite the all-star line-up of great musicians, including Robert Randolph, John Mayer, and the late great Billy Preston, this album is about as interesting as an egg salad sandwich."
1,What happened?,"When I was introduced to Clapton through From the Cradle, my jaw dropped! That was the kind of blues that my soul melted under.Unfortunately ""Back Home"" is not even 1% of what From the Cradle was. I was so disappointed when I listened to a steady stream of happy go lucky bouncy tracks, that it reminded me when someone somehow slipped me one of his early Cream creations and me thinking that I was about to listen to an early blues band..I hope the next record he releases will have some b**ls."
1,"Terrible Blues, Eric Clapton R&B??","Eric Clapton truly has a golden voice and is one of the tastiest guitar players around, but this CD with lots of horns, added electronics and backing vocals sounds like a good R&B album for music on hold / elevator music. There is one good song on the album ""One Day"". Eric Clapton needs to get some sleep and do an album by himself; I think this album would have been much better and most people would have enjoyed this album if it was just Eric and an acoustic guitar on it..."
2,Tracks on album selling do npt agree with tracks on EC's Home Page,This is the track listing on EC's Home Page1.So Tired2.Say What You Will3.Going Left4.Love Don't Love Nobody5.Revolution6.Lost And Found7.Heaven8.Love Comes To Everyone9.One Day10.One Track Mind11.Run Home To Me12.Back HomeTrack 7 on the cd being sold is incomplete and track 8 is not the same title.
2,Should Have Stayed At Home,"Back Home finds Eric Clapton espousing on the joys of being at home with his family. While he deserves domestic happiness, the album harkens back to his worst commercial instincts. Sounding very much like the MOR sounds of his worst efforts like August and Pilgrim. The album has a professional and over-produced sound that is perfectly made for Adult Contemporary radio. The one highlight is The thoughtful and loving cover of Mr. Clapton's good friend George Harrison's ""Love Comes To Everyone"". It is an obscure album track from 1979's George Harrison album and Mr. Clapton puts his heart into and it is a touching tribute to Mr. Harrison. Too bad the rest of the album lacks this loving touch and feels like a bore."
3,nothing to say,"Im not agree with other reviewers here about pilgrim or reptile. i like a lot enough songs in each of them to keep those records in my collection.But im agree about this record. is a bad one. Im not talking about simplicity( by the way, take a look to richard bona, you will remember me for this advice) vs complexity or commercial music vs no compromise music. im talking about good ar bad music. thats the point.you can listen this songs one and another time and nothing will remain in your heart or mind after this. just music for hear in the supermarket helping you to choose your stuff in a good atmosphere. thats all. sry for my basic english. its not my lenguage."
2,Disappointing,A very poppy CD with the girl singers back unfortunately.Sounds more like his early 80s stuff which I found back then to be his worst stuff.I guess Eric can't please everyone but this CD is a real downer.Very little guitar solo's however Erics voice is great.
1,"Back home, now stay home!","Sure, the musicianship is solid, as is the studio production but it's dreadfully missing good guitar work, creative energy, memorable tunes and innovation that once marked this wonderful musician.I came away feeling really cheated, Eric sounds tired and uninspired.It seems the only band left from that ""by gone era"" that is still making ""vital"" rock music is Deep Purple, just check out their new album Rapture of the Deep. It's rock music with something to say, lyrically and musically. Simply brilliant! The release of Back Home is confirmation that Eric Clapton of today is no longer a artistically viable artist. But, it's not the final nail in the Clapton coffin, just a novelty, crawling at a turtle's pace.With two of my favorite artists moving in polar opposite directions, I'd just as soon watch Clapton retire and Deep Purple continue to unfold.Eric Clapton/Back Home: 1 1/2 starsDeep Purple/Rapture of the Deep: 5 stars"
1,Weak!,Very disappointed in this effort by Clapton. Painful listening. I'll take his blues efforts anyday. This is as boring as it gets!
2,OK... a little bit of a let-down...,"I'll be brief and blunt. The new EC disc is slick, clean and rather pedestrian. I have been a loyal follower and fan of EC since first hearing Cream on L.A.'s first free-form FM radio station in the mid-late 60s. I believe he has always been, and is now, a stellar artist. So, it's not without some perspective that I opine on this recent effort. The references to family are great in a scrapbook or photo album. On a record album? I think no. After realizing that what I heard in one of the cuts was a baby crying back in the mix, I really had a hard time going through the remaining material. It's a little too sappy. It's wonderful he is happy and I suppose for some (many?) it's pleasing to hear that happiness echoed in his music. I'll lay out on this one and hope the next time he gets a bit grittier. (No, I don't believe his material has to be dark or that he has to maintain the ""tormented artist"" persona but this is a bit too far up on the happy-meter)."
2,eric? eric? is that you?,"If you buy this disc, buy is used ... get it cheap, 'cause it's BOOOOORRRRRIIIIINNNNNGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!This guy used to be ""god"" ... now, ... it's very sweet, very nice songs ... about sweet nice things ... AND NO GUITAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!That's like watching Shaq bowl! Maybe it peaks your' interest for a second, but it isn't worth much energy to pursue. I kept waiting and waiting for something akin to guitar buzz, rifts ... SOMETHING!!!!! Nope. Not here. Let's go bowling!!!I can not recall being this disappointed in a disc ... 'cepting for Santana's new one, which is even worse.RETIRE, gentlemen ... let someone else play ... they may actually want to!!"
2,Blah,"That's what I feel after listening to this album... blah.I tried very hard to find this record's groove, but easy listening music is not my thing. EC the guitar God is most certainly alseep if not totally dead. The few times I heard his Stratocaster come alive, the noose was tightened and the tone was killed off before it had a chance to make a difference.The music itself is lackluster and uninspiring. There are no stand-out tracks, and every song sounds like it could have been written by any amateur songwriter. With such a great backing band and top-notch guests, this record should have caught fire and burned strong. The only thing notable on the whole album is the nice production.To me it looks like EC has lost his hunger and passion for music and playing.Very sad."
4,for fans only,"id hate to say it but i will, this is a ""decent"" album. i am a really big clapton fan and it hurts to say that. i guess if you are looking for another from the cradle or journey man, you wont find it in this album. this blues man has aged and so has this taste, this album shows he has matured. i went on release day to grab this album and i enjoyed listening to it, but i still love the classics and this cd will probably not get as much play in my cd player...if you love clapton and his ever changing ways then i say snatch this album up but if you are looking for his earlier days of classic rock or blues, you will only find traces..."
2,eric did you bring a guitar to the recording sessions?,message to eric clapton: you're still one of the greatest rock/blues guitarists to ever grasp a pick. we don't buy your music to listen to you sing melancholy love songs! we want to hear you play the guitar with some grit and gusto! i can't wait to purchase the albert hall reunion dvd to see you at your best.
2,I love Clapton but not this uninspired pop session.,"Clapton is one of my favorite artists ... primarily because of his blues background which is a strong influence on his best albums. With the outstanding recent Robert johnson sessions I was expecting something exciting ... but this isn't exciting or, for the most part even interesting. It's okay, but not good. If you are a Clapton fan, you MAY enjoy it ... or at least a couple of the tracks. All in all, it is a bit of a dissappointment. Too Michael Boltonish (a little sappy) .... Your mom would probably think this was a pretty good record. I look forward to the next Clapton release."
2,EC needs to get rid of SC,"I agree with the guy who said this Simon Climie messes up everything. Just listen to Pilgram. It's not very good. As soon as I saw his name I thought ""another"" album ruined. Every once in a while Clapton turns out a good album, From the Cradle, Journeyman, Money and Cigerettes etc. The day he decided the guitar wouldn't be the main focus,,,things went south. He is still a good blues guitarist but if you want to hear great songs, great singing and super guitar riffs and solos, pick up Jimmy Thackery's, Sinner Street, Drive to Survive or Healin Ground. This guy is in Stevie Ray Vaughn's league. The old Clapton (Dominoes,Cream,Mayall) will always be one of my favorites but I just don't want to hear sappy crappy bull and boring guitar."
2,Buyer Beware,"If, like me, you found Mr. Clapton sublime and in the pocket with ""Unplugged,"" ""Me and Mr. Johnson,"" and ""Riding With The King"" (his duet with BB), be careful before you purchase this album.This is an imitative pastiche of recently fashionable pop cliches - 20 years ago for some, and 10 years ago for others. Aside from a couple of nifty flourishes, nothing distinguishes this album. It sounds like Clapton doing Kareoke. He even cops a Lionel Ritchie/Soul Chick groove on one song; it's horrible, even though his pipes are up to the required high notes. So, you might want to sit this one out. He'll be back."
2,I wonder why.....,"Tell me: why do teeny-boppers buy CDs like this and then post 5 or 4-star reviews by the dozen and say nothing more than ""so-and-so is cute"" or ""they're good dancers"" and then not actually take a look into the music itself? If I were you, I'd buy a CD only if I have tried it out first and then liked it. And then I'd have to make as good use of it as possible. That's something I myself have to take note of in the future. So, don't just buy a CD by the BSB, 'N Sync, et al because they're cute or anything like that, buy it only if you find the songs interesting. It just goes to show, after all, that this genre judges only by looks and not talent. Have some talent, please!"
5,depth of passion,"Carol writes with such depth, so much passion. While reading this book of poetry, you will journey through your own passion as the honesty of Carol's words penetrate you. You will remember what love is and what it can be. Carol reveals the deepest and most intimate part of passion that is in her heart and soul. After reading the first poem I was sold. I highly recommend this to anyone who is in love or wants to know what love is and how it can be. I have read this book three times and have shown many of my friends this beautiful book, written by such a beautiful womyn. Honestly, this is a very well written book of her passionate heart. 2 thumbs up ladies."
3,Tender Passion,A book of tender and passionate love poems bravely shared with the world. Perfect as a gift to share with your loved one.
5,Passion's Dream,"As the author takes us through dreams of passion with her poetry, we experience the dreams we each have of loving and being loved. Definitely to be read slowly and with much contemplation."
2,Low information content,"While accurate and wide-reaching, this book has very little real information in it. The problems are challenging only if you don't know the language they reference. The book is, however, well written."
1,Dazed and Confused,"I have to read this book for a course i'm currently taking. It's tough to understand, very disorganized. Many times you wonder to yourself, ""where is Sethi going now? "" His examples are not always related to what he does, and his explanations do not always cover what he should. The book has alot of Pascal and pseudo Pascal stuff in it. If you need a headache, this is the book for you. To give Sethi a little credit though, some of the book is written okay, but this is not nearly enough to conteract all the other problems. Basically this book is like trying to catch a little guppy without a net... real tough. I wouldn't necessarily say don't buy it, but if you can find anything even a little better, avoid this one like the plague, if you can. :)"
1,zero stars,"This book is impenetrable if you don't already know the material, and excrutiatingly slow if you do. Ravi has struck the very rare balance of creating a book that is unsatisfying to virtually all readers. My instructor tells me that he's been hard pressed to find a better book; this frightens me. I am one of the few humans on record to have finished the tome-- I am as worse person as a result. Save yourself-- drop the course, throw the book away! It doesn't even function well as a doorstop (the binding splits after about the third time the book is thrown.)"
1,A substantially bland book.,"I believe that the book covers topics in a superficial way. There is a lack of examples, and there aren't solutions to any of the problems in the back of it. The author seems to concentrate on using big words and never reaching the point of his explanations. His descriptions are as abstract as the English language. Two thumbs down."
1,very hard to understand and,"I am currently reading this book for a senior level course. This book was definitely not written with college students in mind. The author doesn't give any good examples of what he is talking about, and instead chooses make frequent references to snippets of code/pseudocode to try and get his point across. Since he does not give any explanation on how those snippets relates to what he is talking about, it just becomes even harder to understand. Even worse, all of the examples are given in pascal, so if you started out in C/C++ like me, they become even more difficult to follow. Last but not least, there is not a single mention of Java in this book"
1,"Dreadful, horrible, repetitive, terrible...","are the words that describe this book. I am studying for a test right now and I can't bear to read even one more page. I'm not just saying this because its a school book and school is boring...this book is really excruciatingly repetitive and horribly worded. I gotta read alot of the stuff multiple times just to understand what this [guy] is trying to say. He could have simplified the book so it's half the length that it is. Ravi Sethi, the author, sounds like a [conceited person] who thinks he's so smart...He should be fined for writing this book and making poor college students like me read it. This book is causing me much mental anguish."
1,"I, Dave Nellans, love this book with all my heart.","I showed up everyday to class and sat in the front row captivated by this wonderful book's contents. If I could take a class every semester that uses this book I would be in heaven. Thank you, Ravi Sethi, with all of my heart, I love you.-Dave Nellans."
5,An fantastic book in my opinion,"Most of the previous comments are either very favourable to the book (i.e. 4 or 5 stars) or completely against it (1 star).According to me, this book is a fantastic book IF YOU LIKE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES. These are the languages I use (from time to time) on my Linux box: AWK, Scheme, LISP, C/C++, Java, Python and Ruby. I'm also trying to understand AspectJ, Oz and Erlang. I think this book is made for persons like me who find pleasure discovering and using new programming languages (and paradigms).I can understand that if you are a professional programmer (i.e. doing it for a living), this book is of (relatively) little value.Personally, I love this book!"
4,"Hey, this book isn't that bad","OK, so it has a stupid bear on the cover, but as far as methodical organization it actually falls in mid to upper range for books on this topic. I think it is quite reasonable as far as content, clarity, and organization. It is not overly chatty but friendly and less dry than most. It does not shy away from defining terms which some books do. The previous reviews are shockingly harsh. There is an opening for a concise easy to read book in this area and I think this book is a reasonable start."
3,missing thread,"I have lived with this book on my shelf for five years, and during that time have gone back to it a number of times, though I have never read it all the way through for reasons the other reviews will surely explain. I have gone back to it because it is wide ranging and the languages it picks are interesting.Reading it is like having a row of pearls in front of you. Each is clear and self contained, and they are arranged like a necklace would be. The thread between the sentences is missing however, and you have to work hard to supply it yourself.Some of the examples (e.g. the quilt example in the functional programming section) elucidate the nature of the programming style and this is good. When moving into the specifics of a language however, the pearl trick happens and I don't get what I am looking for. When reading a book like this I want to garner the spirit of a language. If I want syntax I download a language reference."
3,"Good, but not $100 good","This is a good book, and the section on Functional Programming is especially interesting. Almost every other book in this area omits FP. (The Pratt book comes to mind as one guilty of this omission.)Having said that, I don't believe that I would pay $100+ for this text. Buy it used!"
1,The most worthless computer science book I've read,"Considering that this book is an inch thick, it really has surprisingly little valuable content. The author does mention a decent number of topics, but usually only in one sentence or excercise; it never seems to be enough to actually learn anything valuable about the topic at hand. It just seems like the information density of the book is too low. Trying to learn from it is like squeezing blood from a turnip. If you want to learn this material, read Programming Language Pragmatics by Michael L. Scott instead--it's far better!"
1,In words: awful,"I noticed that Amazon is ordering more copies of this book. How very sad.... Like smallpox, this book could be eradicated if we all got together and decided to do something about it. What Ravi really needed during the writing of this horrific pile of miscommunication were several humans to have attempted to read the book before its publication. In words: an editor. He also might simply consider not using the construct ""In Words:"". The fact that Ravi must alert the reader ahead of time that he is going to use words to describe something should give you a fairly good idea as to the delightful cadence and pacing he executes throughout. I wish I could post an example of his [his majesty ravi] prose style; but, alas, I think I lit the book on fire along with some old underwear."
1,A deceptive title,"If you are looking for an apologist for company executives, this is the book for you. The book is an easy read, but the viewpoint is that of executives looking at employees. This book basically offers the thesis, ""You can't change executive behavior; so you many as well adapt your thoughts and actions to those of the executives so that you can be productive and happy."" Recommend your read one of Robert Levering's books instead of this one."
4,Hope For The Healing Of Painful Memories,"HEALING OF MEMORIES is a fairly short book which contains a Christ-centered prescription for the healing of painful memories. The authors point out that the healing of such memories can often also lead to physical healings.The plan involves six steps which are gratitude for gifts, asking light for healing of root memories, sorrow for the harm done to Christ, forgiving like Christ, thanks for the growth from the hurt and seeing the new behavior Christ wants. The book includes exercises and reflections to help us practice the steps. It is suggested that we devote 15 minutes daily to this effort. The key is to stick to the daily discipline in order to receive the maximum benefit."
3,disappointment,"This book was quite a disappointment. Given that Woodard's stablemates are Dan Fante and Tony O'Neill, both of whom I quite like, this book fell a little flat. For one, there's very little dialogue. Not until 40 some pages in do we find two people talking. There's some internal discussion, quite a lot in fact, but that just ain't the same. In the end, the book reads a bit too much like a journal, and a whining one at that. There's inconsistency of style as well, with one chapter being simply one long sentence, possibly a homage to Kerouac, but overdone, disjointed. Still, there's the cry from the pit at the bottom of this and I'm open to read another by Woodard."
4,Poor Joe!,"Back in 1962, two different surf groups had the idea to call themselves ""The Surfaris"", combining the two words in the title of the Beach Boys hit ""Surfin' Safari"". One of the groups was the first to record, and had an immediate hit with ""Wipe Out"". The other group said they had the name first, and they continued to call themselves ""The Surfaris"", until a court decision forced them to change their name to ""The Original Surfaris"". This particular CD features the group called ""The Surfaris"" that had a hit with ""Wipe Out"", and not ""The Original Surfaris"". As for the quality of the CD itself, it's actually quite good. It features 11 instrumentals and 7 vocal songs, and it's a heck of a lot of fun. The group had one of the best drummers in surf music, Ron Wilson, who was also a good singer. Their lead guitarist, Jim Fuller, was also very good. If you like surf music, you will enjoy this CD."
2,Misleading Title,"This book should not be recommended for engineering and project management. Its title is misleading.Its contents are way too simple to be considered even as a text book for College. I work at a bank and I thought I was buying a book that would help me improve my skills as a project analyst... I feel deceived.Another thing... its price is too high in relation to its quality (contents, design and materials used)"
5,Checksoft 2005 Personal Deluxe,This is a great program for creating and writing your own checks from multiple accounts using inexpensive blank or light background paper. It is far superior to other similar programs I have tried.
5,No words can describe...,"I was blown away by the music. When you're watching a movie, often the score is buried and this one is worth being resurrected. What makes it more powerful is knowing what the music represents; when you know it's about a never dying love, you can hear it, when you know about Brandon Lee's tragic death, the music reminds us of his last days standing. Various sounds and verses are attached to a scene or a character, and them music takes you with them to relive the sad and terrifying journey of The Crow."
5,The Crow: Original Motion Picture Score,"I love this music. It is so beautiful and so very sad, I had tears in my eyes while listening to it. It fits the movie perfectly."
1,"Ugh, the evil white man...(again)","Since I respect anyone that wants to watch this, I won't give away much of anything (though if you're above 5 years old, you'll have it figured out in about 10 seconds). The performances are fine (and probably the only thing I can recommend here), but it's nauseating ""reverse-stereotype"" conceit is beyond the pail. The writer's/filmmaker's one-track-minded hate is the only ""imprint"" left when the final credits are rolling and it's really sad to see it on display. I am part of a minority here in the U.S. (albeit not Native American) and I can tell you that this kind of thing does NOT help advance us, as a human civilization, beyond the sins, prejudices and horrible mistakes of the past...it only feeds into them.Total and complete garbage packaged as ""art."""
5,unusual,"This movie is different from the one's I usually order. I liked the story, with it's mystical essence. I think it was a great movie. A must see."
1,shaolin vs. the devil's omen,"AN OLD DONNIE YEN MOVIE. THE DVD COVER IS MISLEADING, BECAUSE YEN DOES NOT DO ANY KUNG FU FIGHTING. HE IS ADETECTIVE.PICTURE IS FUZZY.I DID NOT LIKE IT AT ALL."
3,A lesser work by a great artist,"I am in the enjoyable process of re-reading all of my Vonnegut books, and was surprised to see that THE SIRENS OF TITAN is the second-highest reviewed books by amazon.com readers. It is enjoyable, to be sure; but I found PLAYER PIANO, BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS, and JAILBIRD far superior. Oh well. So it goes.To each his own, as they say. You certainly wouldn't be harmed by reading this; but, CAT'S CRADLE and MOTHER NIGHT are far superior works. The movie MOTHER NIGHT, in fact, is a masterwork. But, I am rambling. If anyone reads this review, be sure to put visiting the KURT VONNEGUT MEMORIAL LIBRARY on your Bucket List. Mr. Vonnegut will go down in history as the twentieth century's Mark Twain."
1,Disappointed!,"Make sure you read the first few pages before purchasing. I wish I had, and would definitely send it back if I could. I've gone through the first 20 pages or so, and find it way too weird for me. Add my name to the list of one star reviews! I found it overwritten and dull."
2,"WEIRD, ABSURD, NOT FUNNY","This might as well be a trip to nowhere. Every chapter and every character is loaded down with the handicaps of futility and absurdity. It seems like the writer was attempting a total escape from rationality. One absurdity, that the entire evolution of mankind was directed to the end of delivering a part to a broken down space ship on Titan, simply leads the reader to the next absurdity. Perhaps it was theater of the absurd, perhaps verbal LSD.Earthlings, kidnapped from earth, are robotonized on Mars in order to invade earth in a futile suicide mission to unite all earthlings in a grand new selfless religion. One absurdity followed by an even bigger absurdity.The beautiful Sirens of Titan, three lovely women, were but statues in a pool who end up uselessly encrusted with green algae. Is there anything in life to admire? Perhaps but to appreciate it you must first lose it."
1,One of the worst books I have ever read.,This book was boring beyond belief. When I purchased it the selling point was that it was this author's best book. Good heavens I can't imagine what one of his worst books is like. I managed to read it all but it took a long time because it goes on and on about absolutely nothing. Even the big meaning at the end was a big nothing. Absolutely one of the worst books I have ever read.
1,The Sirens Of Titan (Kurt Vonnegut Series),"This book was such complete crap it doesn't even deserve a rating. However if it needs one, I rate it less than zero. It was the supidest thing I have ever read. What was the point of the book??????? If it was supposed to be some thought provoking study of mankind, then I guess I am am just simple minded because I thought it was stupid. I kept reading it because I thought at some point it would have a point. I was wrong. Do yourself a favor and don't spend your hard earned money on it, you would be better off to use the money to buy a lottery ticket,you may actually get lucky and get something out of that, but even if you don't you would still have more fun reading the back of the lottery ticket. I had to rate this a 1 star, otherwise it wouldn't let me submit my review. It does not deserve a 1."
1,The Sirens of Titan,Amateurish drivel.. I could only stomach 40% and then would have binned it if I could; the Tokenism's poetry and songs were childish and largely nonsensical..
1,The Emperor's New Clothes . .,"I'm not buying any of it. I think Vonnegut stumbled into this persona of ""brilliant author"" by happenstance and has been spurred along by some Hollywood pandering and pseudo-intellectualism.But don't take my work for it, by all means check for yourself. It's certainly easy enough to read and should not take too long.Be true to yourself if not the rest of us. At the end of the book, didn't you find yourself saying, ""Huh?/That's it?/What's the point?/Who cares?""I surely did. I suspect many others did too, but just don't have the strength of character to say so. It's much easier and less scary to just fawn all over Kurt and pretend to be a smart person who understands a special insight that just isn't there."
3,Just awful,"This stinker has a pointless shallow plot, overlong scenes, and a gross lack of sophistication. I found myself wishing that the characters would just die so that this painful read could end. The feeble attempt at ""deep philosophy"" was just laughable and sad... almost as if K.V expects a ""reads-the-back-of-a-cereal-box"" level of intellect. I was overly generous and gave it three stars instead of its deserved two because I almost cracked a smile once... almost. Don't waste your time with this pablum."
5,Vonneguts best!!!,"This book is exquisit. I've read all Vonneguts work and believe this to be his best. A chronosynclastic infundibulum in and of itself. Each character is so finely woven into the novel that one is duped by its simplicity. The book is a monkeys fist of events,characters,and theology. Oh yeah, if anyone knows where I can find a signed,first edition, I would really appreciate that information."
5,Better than Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy,"Whilst growing up in England you are taught that the best sci-fi book in the world is Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, and how funny it is etc. Well, Vonnegut is far funnier, more honest, and a lot more inventive. His style is really morose, but invigorating at the same time (if that is possible). The search for the meaning of humanity's greatest achievements, including the great wall of China, are all wonderfully wrapped up in a cross galaxy joke. The part where there is a race on a moon completely brainwashed to attack the earth is so funny, and symptomatic of why all regimented societys are so ridiculous. My favourite bit is where the guy travelling through space finds his only true friendship with cell-like lifeforms who pulse in appreciation to his heart beat. Excellent sci-fi nonsense!"
1,AAAAgggghhhhh!!,"What a piece of junk. I certainly could write better than this. SiFi should not be that difficult to hold a theme for a story, but this book was utter junk. I hated every page of it and read it only as I was looking for something I never found. I do not recommend buying it ever for any price. I'll send you mine free."
5,Much better than Hitchhickers,"Gags on about everything here, stock picking, the meaning of life - aliens etc. Homourous and unworthly of sci-fi only designation."
2,A disapointment,"I don't think Vonnegut had found his ""voice"" this early in his career there are some interesting sci-fi concepts, with a small degree of humor, but the writing style strikes me as disjointed, and awkward, his later work improves signifigantly."
5,The Rich Celebrities' Guide to the Universe,"Plain and simple, there would probably be no Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as we know it without The Sirens of Titan. Except, only Vonnegut delivers a more scathing approach than Adams, and wrapped more than ever in his head-scratching plots and ""polically correct"" euphemisms."
1,THE SIRENS OF TITAN,"Vonnegut has a very vivid imagination. This work is way to sience fiction! It is so far out there,that it is almost impossiabel to read."
2,"If the point's there's no point, what's the point in reading it?","This may have been cutting edge and thought provoking in 1959, but now it just seems pointless. Reminds me of ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" in that it's major characters are acted upon rather than act. If the point of the book is that there is no point, what's the point in reading it? As with ""Hitchhiker,"" this book just wasn't worth the time."
5,Awesome novel! Vonnegut's near-best!,"i really liked it. it's exciting, sci-fi, adventurous, and wondefully written. I could not have loved it more. except for the ending."
5,The King of our Humerous Reality,"Once again Vonnegut has summerized the human endeavor into a humorous, heart-breaking, and often mesmorizing novel. This work devours the reader whole, pondering thoughts of love, life's meaning, and values. I definitely recommend this book to anyone that is looking for a powerful work read easily. The fantasy is sometimes closer to the truth. Vonnegut is a master storyteller. One for the ages."
3,Clever but it ran on,The book had all the Vonnegut character of humor and imagination but I think it rambled on much too long. It was not one of my favorite Vonnegut books.
4,Sirens of Titan,"It's quite a journey, with a martian army, harmoniums on Mercury, and an alien on Titan. He finds the true meaning of life through an insane person, he gets to go back to Earth before the end, and with a little help from an alien friend...he gets to find out someone up there must like him. It's insane how all this craziness comes together so perfectly, and there is much I did not mention here. Just read it."
4,He does it again,"Another solid addition to Vonnegut's body of work. The story keeps you guessing, the satire is thick, and the humor is DARK. Vonnegut leaves nothing sacred. From religion, to humanity, to the very meaning of life, no stone is left unturned."
4,ONE of t,"This is the third time I have read this book. I read it once as a teenager almost forty years ago. A second time fifteen years ago. This third time it lost a bit, but by the end I still got that romantic kick that I got the first time. It kind of snuck up on me."
3,Nostalgic read,Vonnegut always brings me back to my college years; that's why I enjoyed this book. It's a nostalgic experience although I am not in that type of wavelength any more.
5,A Heartwarming Science Fiction Masterpiece!!!,"This is my fifth Vonnegut read, and is very close to being my favourite book. I loved this book for it's memorable characters, it's excellent writing style, and most of all it's beautiful yet sad ending. I adore Malachi Constant. He's a terrible man at the beginning but a sweet man at the end. You know, I just love how every single time I read the back of a Kurt Vonnegut book, The whole plot doesn't come till the very end. I love this book! It's sad, beautiful, and at last Brilliant!!!"
2,Sorry Unk!,"""The Sirens of Titan"" by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. did not appeal to me. The nonsensical meandering narrative appeals to this authors fans but I find it offputting and tedious. Not my cup of tea Unk, sorry!"
4,A classic.,If you are a sixties and classic sci fi fantasy fan this is for you. It is pure Kurt Vonnegut and a companion to Cat's Cradle. If you can slide your mind back to the sixties you will love it.
3,Not my favorite,"Not my favorite of Vonnegut's, and I put it down several times before coming back to finish it. Granted, I came to this after reading Cat's Cradle and after reading Slaughterhouse Five. The Sirens of Titan's is harder core science fiction than all his others, but I understand that was his intent. The concept was fine, the execution fine, but I guess it just wasn't my kind of book. Still, I'm glad I read it."
3,The Sirens of Titan,A dated but interesting view of possible futures for the planet. Not much science and heavy emphasis on twisted interpersonal interactions.
5,A victim of a series of accidents as are we all.,"This is my favorite Vonnegut story and I am a big Vonnegut fan. I had not read it in 20 years but it still was fabulous. ""I am a victim of a series of accidents, as are we all""."
3,Uneven narrative is still a great effort.,"The story got bogged down after the beginning, and I considered dropping it. I'm glad I didn't. But Vonnegut fans know his strengths, so I won't discuss them. This is classic Vonnegut.I will, instead, point out two ideas in the book that I think even Vonnegut might rethink today. First, the idea that a rapist and his victim could fall in love is not surprising at the time the novel was written, but it would hardly be considered appropriate today. Second, the idea that lies are comforting at the end of life is also rather suspect."
3,Sirens of Titan - Classic SF,"Kurt Vonnegut is a well respected writer that typically takes his protagonist on convoluted journey that leads him ultimately to a personal realization of some bigger truth. In this regard the ""Sirens of Titan"" is a typical Vonnegut.The author's message is that there is No God, good luck, bad luck, successs and failure is the result of the universe's uncaring randomness; breeding, hard work, faith or lack of thereof having no impact upon your ultimate fate. Yet ironically this is demonstrated through the eyes of the main characters who's fates are controlled in infinite detail by the one character convincing them it's all random chance.A bit dated, but still a good read and a bit thought provoking. Enjoy it!"
5,The Sirens of Titan,"This book is one of the most heartfelt books Vonnegut may have ever written. It has a great plot, and writing style, just like all of his other books. Its the story of Malachi Constant and how a visit with a man who can see the future, past and present after a mishap in space. It asks questions everyone has, such as: Are we the only lifeforms? Do we really have free-will? and Vonnegut answers them in his unique writing style. It is my favorite and if you read it, you'll love at as much as I do. Also read ""Cat's Cradel"". I love it just as much as this one."
2,Blah blah blah,"I got most of the way through this book by promising myself that just around the corner will be something interesting that doesn't annoy me. Eventually the fear of more disappointment trumped the anticipation of discovering the point of this book and I was forced to abandon my beleaguered effort. The biggest problem for me was that none of the characters were likable.If you are looking for an engrossing page turner, look elsewhere."
2,Beyond the blue horizon - Lou Christie,"I ordered ( and payed much ! ) for the cd album : "" Beyond the blue horizon / More of the best of Lou Christie "".Especially for the song : ""She sold me magic "".After a few weeks I received an 2nd hand album of Lou Christie : ""Beyond the blue horizon / Hey you cajun "" .A whole different album , other songs and NOT my favourite song included ! Someone has cheated me and let me pay TOO MUCH for that cd! I do not like this !"
1,China crap run.,Would not buy again. New ceramic brakes an these rotors already groved at 5k. These use to be made in USA but they close the plant and moved to china crap.
1,not even for beginners,This book is for maybe a pre teen looking to make a BBQ sauce to make their mother or father proud.
4,"Another classic from the Man, Don C., Hockey extremist, who I love",Don Cherry loves to rile up the liberalmorons with there 'political stupidity'and keep the fights a-comin'! Nobodyknows the roots of Hockey better oris more of a character now than Cherrysince Eddie Shack! Grapes let's 'TheGood times role' and his schtick isbetter than ever. Long live Grapes.And let the foreigners and frencheat cake!
1,Overblown Prose/ Overblown Praise,"The gardens at Winterthur are undoubtedly beautiful, but were grandly assisted by being built upon a magnificent stretch of undulating territory and executed by 300 gardeners during its development. DuPont's role is certainly worth lauding, but not in the embarrassingly fawning, reverential way this book is written. Even his daughter presents a more realistic portrait of the man, his garden, and his collecting obsessions in her own recent book.He was such a shy and inarticulate man, that the quotes throughout the book are almost embarrassing. He sounds like Chauncy Gardner in ""Being There."" The author and her Winterthur sponsors would have served their subject better had they not expressed their admiration in such florid, effusive prose. A great garden speaks for itself.Read, instead, Hal Bruce's, ""Winterthur in Bloom"" for a rich, lyrical tour of the natural garden without the irritating hype and turgid writing."
4,Slanted story of Henry Francis Dupont's Garden,"As a director of Winterthur Garden near Wilmington, Delaware, the author is hardly about to criticize her employers or their deceased benefactor, Henry Francis Dupont, but she sometimes gets carried away with her praise for Harry while failing to provide much information on the Bidermanns, who started the estate, or on how gunpowder money, and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of soldiers, funded Dupont's hobby which basically involved non-formal color woodland landscaping concentrating on rhododendrons. The book includes attractive color photos of the woods around the estate but provides only a small b/w map of the present estate and gardens, hardly suitable for use when touring the gardens. Not recommended for gardeners on tight budgets, but of interest to those who are fascinated with the Duponts."
4,Not your standard-issue capoeira album!,"A strikingly varied set of songs based on the beat and boing-boing-boing of Bahia's homegrown martial arts form, capoeira. This is a much richer and more melodic set than most capoeira albums, which tend to stick to the rhythms and can get a little repetitious. Here, by contrast, artists from throughout the world modernize and play around with this distinctive sound -- there's fairly traditional material, mixed in with funk, samba, techno and pop stylizations... there's even one improbable free jazz track! This album is both challenging and a lulling delight to hear... Recommended!"
3,not for training,"The music on this cd is not designed for training or playing Capoeira. It is more like different artist paying tribute to the traditional music of Capoeira. The music in most cases is a blend of African rhythyms and R&B grooves. If you like internationl music, this cd is a good addition to your collection."
3,The music is great ... the sound engineer is lousy,As other reviewers have already said it ... the music is wonderful. My big complaint is the level for Garbarek's sax ... everytime he comes on I have to turn the volume down and then back up to listen to the vocals.
4,Teach to be Rich,"Robert Kiyosaki's Latest Book ""Teach to be Rich"" is a great summary of how those who are truly knowledgable about money and finance can become highly affluent. He also does an excellent job of describing the falacy of much of the financial advice offered by our ""financial advisors"" and other self proclaimed money experts today. He shows how his game ""Cash Flow"" is a wonderful way to learn many of the rule of good financial thinking.TJHRich Dad's - Teach to Be Rich: Because the Best Way to Learn Is to Teach What You Want to Learn and the Way to Get Rich Is to Help Others Become Rich (Teach to be Rich, Parts I - III (workbook only))"
5,A refreshing guide to Coca-Cola's adorable Polar Bears,"As the widely-recognized ambassadors for Coca-Cola, Polar Bears occupy a special spot in my Coca-Cola collection. No doubt about it, these adorable bears and cubs make it all too easy to be smitten with the collector bug. Now I'm delighted to have a handsome hardcover book about these bears to add to my Coca-Cola treasures.Thanks to this ""family scrapbook"" with colorful photos and general descriptions, I can now admire and covet the many Coca-Cola Polar Bears in every size, shape and variety. The authors even provided a list of resources that will come in handy. While I would have loved more technical details about how the TV ads were created and animated, overall I'm ""beary"" happy!"
1,I should have listened,"This book was not worth the purchase price or even the shipping. There are no recipies. The book could have been summed up in a paragraph or less. ""cut meat and dry it"".... that sums up the book. Do not waste your time or money on this one. It only proves that anything can be published...."
2,kindle version - beware if page #'s needed,"I have read this in a number of reviews, about the lack of page numbers on the Kindle version. I have been (I felt) very diligent in checking the books that I am purchasing as I need to be able to reference material for APA papers. The preview of this product shows the page numbers - however, when I purchased the Kindle version - there are no pages for you to reference. I now need to purchase the book version for my class. Not that books are cheap enough or anything - I like that I have to double purchase because I didn't get what I was shown when purchasing. Beware Students! If you have to reference pages - DO NOT purchase the Kindle version."
2,Very technical for the topic,"If you're expecting a light read regarding training, this is not the book for you. It's very technical. If you need complex ROI calculations, this may be good to pick up, but if you're just a plain ol training coordinator looking to improve your skills, you may want to pick up one of the Dummies books."
1,Unbelevably bad.,"I really don't understand how this could be so awful. Terrible writing and a early/bad CGI Mr. Bill version of ""A Christmas Carol"" - I mean come on, isn't Mr. Bill supposed to be primitive claymation? There's a reason this isn't out on DVD."
4,Mr.Bill has a christmas party with his family.,Not the best Mr.Bill film ever but was nice to see Don Novella(father Guido Sarduchi)
1,home slave,"Having purchased a LaCrosse WS-1611-IT assuming positive evaluations were accurate, I was let down with La Crosse product value. Within the first year the wind paddle fell off of the mounting. La Crosse replaced this. Later the wind speed, direction and chill factor failed to register. Contact by internet and telephone have resulted in no return communication as noted in their listed phone number answering message. Three months have passed and still no e-mail or return calls from product support as their call center phone states. DO NOT PURCHASE IS MY RECOMMENDATION"
3,Not bad at all.. When it works,"Product works as advertised but after a while the wind chill, speed and temp stop working and the batteries need to be pulled out of both the transmitter and receiver in order to fix the problem. Not a big deal but it does reset the history which is a nice to have. Overall I'm pretty happy with it but I wish I had something I didn't have to run out and reset every week."
1,I have had this for 6 months -- I 2 parts do not work and no help from this company,After 6 months No Temp Readings... yes the wind paddles are so weak a mosquito could probably break it.. the temp sensor and the wind gauge are connected by a telephone wire but you cannot take it off the wind gauge so you can mount this highly delicate piece of ??? It does took like a nice thing to buy... but since lacrosse takes about 1-2 months to answer an email and you cannot get anything replaced or even a (yes the wind gauge should have been built in a manner that would make it easier to mount and not break as mine did when it got hit by the wind or some tiny piece of debris... then the thermostat does not work after 4 months ... I will be more than willing to sell mine for 50 dollars to someone who wants to see what the 70 dollar product will look like and how it will operate after a few weeks and months!
1,Don't Buy This,"The transmitter on this weather station fails in about 8 months or as long as your batteries last. Once the batteries go dead the base station will never pick up the signal again. La Crosse replaced the first transmitter. The second transmitter also died in about 8 months. La Crosse says the problem is caused by bad batteries. Well, duh! Batteries do go bad after a period of time. Shouldn't the weather station be built so it can withstand battery replacement? I love the info when the thing works but I won't bother with this model again."
3,Segmented Readout,"We like our weather station (WS-1611TWC-IT Professional), received for a Christmas gift, but we are having problems with the windspeed readout. The digits are segmented, and a trouble call to the customer service line required 3 contacts to get a callback. We were told to use ONLY namebrand batteries, even though the drugstore brand are alkaline and work well in other parts of our house. The install directions should state to use ONLY namebrand batteries, so that we do not need to go out in zero degree weather and dismantle the sensors and replace all the batteries. We still have to do that, now that the daytime temp is above zero. If that does not resolve the problem, then it must be sent back to the company for a resolution.E.D.M., Morgantown WV"
1,Customer Service is non-existent,"We have used this product about 6 months. When we changed the batteries the unit would not reset. We have called and emailed the company repeatedly and have received no acknowledgement except the canned email you get. We have tried to call several times in the last 2 weeks, where you can only leave a message. The call has not been returned.Amazon can not help us. The warranty is through LaCrosse.I definitely would not tell any one about this product due to the lack of customer service.Melody"
2,Weather Channel Weather Center,"We chose this one because it was one of the few ones that gave wind and wind chill. HOWEVER, it has alarms that go off night and day, and we haven't figured out what to do. We have now had it for several weeks. My husband says just to be patient and he will have it working right and it will be the best thing we've ever bought. He needs to contact the Help people, but hasn't and probably will not. I still like the options it offers, but it's driving me crazy. Wish they would come pre-programmed so you don't have to go through this. I'll change the rating if it ever gets going right, but for now it is merely an irritation."
4,"Easy to use, accurate","Installation very simple, provides continuous information on Weather conditions, Does what it claims to do."
1,Le Crosse WS-1611TWC-IT,"I am so disappointed! I recently purchased and installed a model WS-1611 weather station. Since I had about 10 feet too much cable, I made the mistake of cutting the cable and installing phone connectors. Of course, the station didn't work. ON PAGE 52 of the instruction book I found the warning not to cut the cable. It would have been nice to have the warning at the beginning of the installation instructions, but I accept this was my mistake. I spliced the original cable parts together and the station still didn't work. I ordered and installed a new thermo-hydro sensor, since the instruction book ON PAGE 52 stated that the sensor might be damaged. The weather station still doesn't work, and everything has been restored to factory specs. I am angry that I spent well over a hundred dollars and countless hours trying to get the station to work. I believed that La Crosse made quality instruments. I guess I was wrong"
1,Product failure,Three months after installation the Thermo-Hygro Sensor failed to transmit to the Weather center making the unit useless. The manufacturer has poor customer service and we are still trying to resolve the problem. I would not recommend this unit.
5,works as advertised,"This unit performs as advertised. The rain gauge seems accurate and measures to 100th inch. pressure and temp and humidity mirror another unit I have. I need to move the wind gauge a little higher as it is being blocked by some shrubbery. I'm about 200' away from the house, through one wall and a closet and get good reception. There are extensive alarms for most functions. History of all measurements is recorded every 3 hours and the highs and lows are saved until reset. It's been up and running for a couple of months now, no real storms yet."
3,Okay for the money,This unit is okay but you get what you pay for. I had to send it back because the anemometer broke - just from the wind - normal use. Saving my money for a professional unit.
1,Worst piece of junk I ever purchased,I really don't have words low enough to describe this product. Vulgarity would be a compliment.I bought this product for about 80 some dollars. The wind censor cup broke almost immediately out of the box.Save your money don't buy this piece of junk.Boycott companies who push cheap over priced products like this made in china on us.
3,Weather center,I use this every day especially when the weather turn bad. I like tracking wind speed and the rain amounts. I had some difficulties entering the dates and time of day because the direction were not very clear. I am an avid gardner and I find the information from the weather center helpful.
1,The station couldn't make it a year in San Diego,"Santa purchased this station less than a year ago. It is now unable to send data from the outside monitor to the inside. Not just incorrect, there is no data showing on the inside large monitor. I changed all batteries ASAP. No difference. The outside monitor still shows the data on it's small screen. There is no way to fix it unless you have the tool bench that is set up for the tests. I am extremely disappointed. Earlier, when I first received for Christmas from my wife, the two pieces, outside and inside, when sitting next to each other did not show the same values for temperature or humidity. This thing is a poorly made, well marketed piece of junk.Bummer. I have had weather stations for 15 years. This is the worst one."
2,Won't last long,After less than 2yrs the top 2/3 of the LCD display screen numbers are broken (I see either top or bottom of the number readouts). The barimetric numbers and below aren't broken...yet. I'm replacing the 2 AA batteries in the exterior remote every 2 weeks (52 Batts/yr@$2ea=$104/yr...costs more than the unit). I wouldn't get this again.
1,loaded with problems + NO customer support!,"Stay away from this product, it is prone to failure and there is ABSOLUTELY NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT. You will be wasting your money if you purchase this product as it WILL FAIL and you will have no recourse as to honoring any warranty."
3,Fair product,product was a fairly nice unit overall. Two things I didnt really like are that it doesnt read the inside tempeture and humidity and the biggest thing is it takes too much time a too many buttons to push to get all the readings reset. 10 times pushing the button just to reset the rain gauge then two more bottons to set it to normal mode. Three weeks after I received this I saw the same unit at Walmart for the same price with no shipping charge. Best advice is read the product description more closely.
2,Does not hold up,"This unit will no longer sync, once the batteries died, followed the directions to sync the unit within the number of seconds. Even with a helper will not sync up unfortunately out of warranty (lasted a year) Not impressed and would not reccomend purchasing. Customer service is non exisitent"
2,Biophile,"I received the La Crosse WS weather station as a birthday present from my wife and son, and thoroughly enjoyed it for several months, until the receiver got knocked off the kitchen counter. Despite no visible sign of damage, it then stopped receiving the signal from the sensor station. I called La Crosse, and the first person I talked to was sympathetic, and agreed that such a mishap shouldn't have caused failure. La Crosse sent me instructions for ""rebooting."" but nothing worked. I called La Crosse again, but this time talked to a less sympathetic person, who classified the failure of my unit as ""abuse"" and was therefore not covered under warranty. So be aware that the receiver is not very durable (our cordless phones hit the floor all the time and keep working), and that the company is not very interested in keeping satisfied customers. For now, I will satisfy my weather-watching need by aquiring a different brand that will stand behind the ""Professional"" label."
4,Works great!,This weather station seems to work very well. The temperature feature is very accurate. Overall a very good product.
3,"Too soon to really know, but first impression:","Just got this weather system for Christmas and put it up today. I agree with the other reviewer- hardest part is deciding where to place the 3 components. Decided to mount the wind direction/speed unit to the post of the antenna mast. Got myself up on the roof and was attaching the supplied tie wraps that are included and the damn tie raps breaks while up on the roof! Lucky I had some quality raps in the garage to use instead. Poor quality plastic, brittle tie wraps! I will supply a follow- up review in a month or so."
1,LaCrosse Technology 1611U-IT - Buy something different,"If want a product that when installed properly will work for more than a year, shop elsewhere. Service from LaCrosse is by email only, they do not answer a phone nor will they return a phone call, and after you provide them all of the details of your issues with the product, they run you through the exact same set of questions you already answered. We are on our THIRD weather vane assembly. Works almost great until the first snow/freeze, then just either gums up so the vane will not spin, or stops communicating completely to the base station. I try to be reasonable and rarely write bad reviews about stuff, but I would encourage a deeper look at other manufacturers if you want to rely on the results from a weather station."
2,WS-1611,"I've had this weather station for just over 2 years. It's worked great until now. The wind speed, chill and direction have all failed. I have tried the reset procedure twice...no luck. I won't buy this one again."
2,Buyer beware,I do not recommend this weather station.The multiple times I had to contact customer support regarding the unit not working the reply was always to replace the batteries with brand name batteries that have an expiration date longer than 7 years. Finding batteries with that long of an expiration date is next to impossible. After the 4th time of finding and replacing the specified batteries I finally gave up and bought another brand.
2,Not What I Expected,"My wife bought me the WS-1611 last year. I like the information that the unit provides, but I have to say that the instructional steps are positively unmanageable. First, the Operation Manual is small (3-1/2x4-1/4 inches. The booklet has 56 pages of settings, readings, adjustments and warranties. And that's just the English version! With the French and Spanish versions included in the same little booklet, it is very difficult to read and, at the same time, make adjustments to the unit. The steps change from ""holding the SET key for 2 seconds"" to ""press the SET key to switch on or off the alarm."" It seems that the designers wanted to include as many features as possible, but did not think things through enough -- what I consider ""duct tape thinking."""
2,Not up to the Lacrosse standard,"It installed just fine, worked for awhile then quit registering wind speed. The display is too busy, the clock is not atomic, and the wind paddle fell off and took flight. I would not recommend this product nor buy it again."
4,Much to enjoy,"I loved the film and so I had to get the soundtrack. It does a great job at supporting the wacky larger than life antics that go on as well as the more emotional elements of the film. Upon a recent listen I was reminded of Danny Elfman in some instances, especially on 'The Chase' and the arrangement on 'The Hula Hoop'. My one big complaint is that the entire cd runs just under 30 minutes. Now I can't remember if that's all the music that was presented in the film, but it seems to me that there's plenty that's not presented on this soundtrack. But I guess wanting more is a better compaint to have than others."
5,Inshape,Excellent workout!Easy to follow but every muscle feels like it has gotten a workout when it's done.Enjoyed the music and the pace of the workout.Great dancers!Highly recommended for anyone.
5,Yummy & Sensual,"I bought my first of endless bottles on sale on a whim years ago. I've been wearing this scent ever since. I have had soooo many compliments from men. The common reaction has been (their eyes closed, sniffing the air) stating ""you smell good, you smell like some kind of dessert, like something to eat"". I wear it because it smells yummy & sensual to me. My husband says I smell like ""fruitty pebbles"" (his favorite cereal)haha. A magical perfume that smells like something different to different people. Oh and when women ask me what I'm wearing...I mysteriously forget the name."
4,Love it,I love this smell..I would have given it 5 stars but Im yet to snag a date based on the pheromones lol.
2,Looking for something I didn' found...!,"I was looking for a perfum with pheronomes (if it exist), they add this product as if it real. Didn't smell as perfum reallydidn't smell, nor last. I didn't return because it was too expensive to do it, and doesn't worth to spent more money. An otherscam."
5,Realm perfume,"rich's stopped selling years ago, couldnt find it. AWSOME! amazon had it, and for a crazy price. this is a wonderful produt that inhances your pharmone, i get lots fo complements on it. i love it."
5,A bit strong but I love it.,"I don't wear perfume often but I wanted something a bit different and more sensual and I'm so glad I got this. Seems like my husband's glad I got it too:) I don't put much on at all because if I were to use a full spray, it would be too strong for me; however, a small amount still does the trick. This is definitely going to be the perfume I use all the time."
5,very nice scent,"I absolutely recommend this scent. It's very pleasing, not too heavy and not too light. It's not too sweet, either. I purchased it based on others' reviews, so I am leaving mine for others to read. I think you will like it. I'm really glad I bought it."
4,Good purchase,"The purchase was quick and easy. It has a bit of a cinnamon, orange and asiatic smell. Do not spray too much otherwise, it is a bit too musky."
1,Didn't care for the smell,The product was shipped promptly but unfortunately I didn't care for the smell. I am going to send it back.
3,Not fast. Not easy.,"This book is mistitled. Mr.Warner seems to be expert in his field, however I'dcall this ADVANCED JIGS FOR THE EXPERT WOOD WORKER.I have read a dozen books on wood techniques, and itwill be many months beforeI figure out some of thediagrams and terminologyused in this tome."
5,Nothing good is easy,"If you are looking for the highest quality results done safely then the methods in this book will serve you. It is true that the techniques given are not easy. There is a lot of assumed knowledge and beginners will need to study carefully. I have found the information here to be invaluable. Once I was able to unravel the content, I invariably found Mr. Warner to be correct. His approach is to obtain professional quality joinery but without handcutting skills. The jigs and fixtures are the key to remove the operators dependence on hand to eye coordination. Give it a chance and you will be able to do things you never thought possible. One has to have a concentration on detail to fully exploit this book. If you want woodworking for dummies, you will get furniture with no character or ""WOW"" factor."
4,Their most accomplished record yet .,"This piano-led trio have carved out a space somewhere between the thoughtful European jazz of Keith Jarrett and the atmospheric textures of Sigur Rós or Radiohead.Their last album sold many thousands copies and they fill the major concert halls in Europe.This is their 10th album, and the major influence is Bach, most noticeably in the mathematical purity of tracks such as Beggar's Blanket.From the opening classical piano pattern disrupted by a guitar power chord, ""Tuesday Wonderland"" avoids the usual melody-improvisation-melody structure beloved of most jazz bands.It may be too introverted for some, but E.S.T. balance this with expressive solos to make their most accomplished record yet."
2,Nothing Original,"I own every domestic Esbjorn Svensson Trio album and this is the first one to disappoint me. With each of their other albums there are songs that are truly unique in composition, sounds and performance. However, this album is missing that innovation. To me, this album sounds like it was made by taking a handful of older, mediocre EST songs, dropping them in a blender and mastering what comes out. It sounds rehashed. The songs also aren't differentiated from each other, so it's not very noticeable when one song ends and another begins."
2,Waiting for Wednesday.,"I'm not sure what E.S.T. was trying for here. Lost are many of the qualities that us fans have come to love and expect from them. Gone are the catchy melodies, replaced by more Noise. Usually, they use noise elements as an interesting background layer that adds interest and mood. Here it seems to dominate and undermine the compositions. If I want to listen to something loud and noisy, I'll listen to someone else. Of course, not every recording can be as good as ""Seven Days of Falling"", but it would be a shame to see these guys lose us. Growth and evolution is good. This, however, appears to be something else. It's not for me."
5,Excellent Series :),"Absolutely love this series, just wish the English dub didn't sound like an amatuer job.But I totally recommend it!"
3,I did get the product,"but it was late getting here, I contacted them and they were very helpful and they made sure I got my product, I was just a little upset that it was late."
2,Too many italics,"I did not get very far with this book, partly was because there were simply too many italics to disrupt and distract the flow of the reading. Italic, by definition, is used for emphasis, or to separate different kinds of information in a manuscript; but apparently Ms. Solomon had this fondness, or perhaps the urgent need to mass producing these emphasis that effect turned out to be the opposite. I have counted: Page 1--5 italics, Page 2--3 italics, Page 3--4 italics...there were italics in just about every page...Besides, this was just not an interesting read. Since I quit reading early, I'm not sure that I could honestly rate this book, but I'll just follow suit with the other reviewer."
4,Nice Collection Of Lesser Hits...,"Apparently designed as a companion volume to MCA's ""Greatest Hits"" CD, ""More Greatest Hits"" has some pretty good songs like ""Twixt Twelve And Twenty"" and ""With The Wind And The Rain In Your Hair"", and duplicates none of the tracks on ""Greatest Hits."" Looks like Varese has discontinued this title. Good sound quality, taken from the original Dot masters."
5,the littles go exploring,The book is about littles or little people. They live in the Biggs wall. Their grandpa disappeared.They are trying to find him. They found a little room. Do you think that grandpa was in the little room? Read the book and find out! I like the part were they find the room. I do not like the part were they go down the chimeney.
1,Rip Off,"The battery pictured is not what I was sent. The numbers match up but the capacity Amp Hours is less than the original battery that came with the phone. It is not Extended. Tried to contact Lenmar, no response."
1,Battery,The first battery received was defective - had been opened but took a while for me to realize this --- when contacting Amazon a new battery was immediately dispatched to me - had it in a day - and a Saturday to boot -- fantastic service. Shona
5,Pass the MCP exam on the first try!,"Thanks to the authors and editor, I passed the MCP exam the first time I took it. Although it's relatively short (166 pp.), it is *densely* packed with an excellent overview of everything you'll need to know to pass the exam. The ""Further reading"" section at the end of each chapter helped me focus my preparation time by pointing me to specific chapters of other helpful books from Hentzenwerke Publishing and other publishers as well as to various articles and URLs at Microsoft's web site.If you would like to pass the MCP exam the first time (and save money by not having to re-take the exam), buy and read this book now!"
4,Points you in the right direction,"This book goes over the topics that you need to know for certification in a straight forward manner. Your level of knowledge will determine how much of the suggested 'further reading' you will need to do. If you are quite experienced then you should be able to pass by just reading this book (and maybe brush up on VSS). There isn't much else out there to use as a study guide, so it makes this book that much more valuable."
4,An important resource,"For anyone who wants to take the Visual FoxPro certification exams, there are scant few resources available that are specifcally targeted to helping you pass the exams. No Transacender. No Exam Cram. Thats what makes this book so valuable. The book is a study guide. It will give you a overview of the main topics that are covered on the exams an give you references to where you can learn more. You will have to supplement this book by researching the references and using your experience. The dicussions on normalization and debugging apps were particularly good. In all, there is a huge void for anyone studying for VFP certification which this book helps fill."
2,"so cute, but got the wrong size","this dress is really cute, unfortunately the size info wasn't accurate enough and it turned way too big for our mini pinscher. We were very disappointed."
2,WEASTTTTTT COASSSSSSSSSST,i'm going to give it a 2 star just because of that corny hands up single otherwise it is 0 star album.hunger for more was MUCH better!well deserved FLOP;)
3,The R&B Songs saved This From 2 Stars,"I love Lloyd Banks, he's a good rapper. But what happened?The rhyming is so-so but it was agony for me. Something or somebody slipped and fell on quality and made it worse on this album. ""Cake"" is really good but predictable; how many times are you gonna sample Broadway music? Sounded like Oliver again. ""Help"" is my favorite track for the simple fact of Keri's singing, but his rhyming and his delivery is horrible. My goverment is Chris really killed it for me. He still has some witty crafty lyrics on the album but that's one track there and one track here over a 15 track album. He stuck all the good songs in the middle, one after the other which leaves the rest of the album off the speakers, for me anyway. I was expecting more out of him but I guess the truth is getting to him. G-Unit isn't hot anymore."
2,crap,this is the worst rap album i have herd in a long time big let down compared to the 1st album. chech out hussein fatal if ya want to hear a good rapper.
2,rotten indeed,this album is suspect at best. It's no where near hunger for more and that album was just bearly ok. This album suffers from too many guest appearences and waaaaaaaaay tooooooooo much 50. Buy if you dare but do not expect a classic.
3,Forget The CA CA CAKE.........,"It's all about the C.R.E.A.M. G-Unit is the poorman's Wu-Tang,although Llyod Banks is good lyricst he is still not as good as U-God or even close to Gza,Rae or Ghost.The album is not bad at all but Llyod is starting to sound lazy like 50."
3,Rotten apples - cut some peices off,This Bank$ album wasn't to bad. Bank$ could have but a little more into the music. His voice is also a little to quite in some of the tracks. In a style where lyrics are everything you have to be able to hear what the man says.
3,What happened?,"This album is above average, but not by much. The hunger that was in his debut is obviously gone, and thanks to good producing, this album still delivers a couple of songs that connect. Hopefully banks comes strapped for his next album; he's better than this."
2,rotten mess!,"IM A BIG FAN OF THE UNIT,BUT THIS BANKS ALBUM WASN'T GOOD AT ALL! THE ONLY SONG I CONTINUE TO BUMP AND LOVE IS ""CAKE""! THE REST OF THE ALBUM WAS A BUNCH OF ROTTEN GARBAGE! AND I REALLY TRIED TO LIKE THIS ALBUM,BUT THOSE MISERABLE SONGS WEREN'T PULLING MY EAR AT ALL!"
1,and yeah you spoiled the bunch,g g gg g unot ever since 50 fired game his sales have decreased screw you banks you unfunky worm crawl back in that rotten apple you came from bad worm bad banks. I hope llyod banks never record another cd again.
5,YA BOY BANKS IS BACK!,"he back and still got the same hood lyrics. Noone can beat him- even Cassidy backed down to him. Lloyd Brings up G-unit alot. This ablum is hot, I deff recommend it to all G-unit Fans."
1,B*tch please this is garbage,"Lloyd banks's""rotten apple"" is pretty much trash just like his album before r.a. It shoulda been called Garbage rap. Thats wut it realy iz! Rhymin about clothe, parties, is over done, and over used, but sadly most people still will fall for it and support this kinda trash. Sad."
1,Worst CD In A Long Time,"If you like real rap, not bubble gum rap, DO NOT buy this. It's horrible. I thought that Hunger for More was really good, but this flat out sucked. There was not one good track. A good rapper turned bad by the likes of 50 Cent."
4,why did it take me so long ?,"When this album came out in early fall 2006, the G-Unit backlash was just starting and no one paid any attention to this.The lead single ""Hands Up"" w/ 50-produced by Eminem is actually one of the few songs you should skip. And there are a few others that didn't do much for me either. Other that that, these songs are hittin. In 2008 I tried to get into this album but gave up early on, glad I gave it another chance. It's noticeably better than his first and at least equal to HFM2."
2,So So,"On Lloyd Banks' second solo outing, I felt that this album lacked a certain something, I found myself skipping numerous tracks. But I did lik Hands Up, Help, Addicted, One Night Stand, adn Change. But other than that I felt it wasn't a really powerful album."
5,Perfect Shelf Support Solution,"I ordered these knowing they would not show after installation, so finish color was unimportant and I could make an inexpensive choice for my project. I was happily surprised at the very high quality of these sturdy, attractive,consistently machined pins. All were finely finished, exact to measurement, and without blemish. The pins fit perfectly into a 1/4"" drilled hole, with no wiggle room. I would definitely order these for my next project(s). As an added bonus, the shipping charge was next to nothing and shipping was very speedy! These get the highest rating I could offer on any product."
5,Pure Genius,Even if you own all the other Enz albums this one is still worth having... Its the best flowing compilation I have ever heard.Pure genius
5,GAAP Filled,"Thank god - not another Accountancy textbook that just looks pretty sitting on my shelf ! UK GAAP covers all the areas you need on a day to day basis as a student right through to director level. Approaches all the topics from different angles ; eg the rules, how they apply, the variations, and most importantly specific examples of their use in UK companies - and all in clear English. Regular updates from the publishers are sent on the latest accountancy issues and changes once you register - saves time in the library. Also recommended is the CD-Rom version for quick and easy look-ups , especially when on the move."
5,Great quality!,These are well made and very sturdy. I really like that they come in a variety of sizes and colors.
5,unforgettably touching,"Ralph Macchio was truly unforgettable in this movie. I always enjoyed him in the ""Karate Kid"" movies and ""My Cousin Vinny"", but ""Forever Together"" truly showed Mr. Macchio as a versatile actor. Diane Ladd was funny and touching...10 stars as far as I'm concerned."
2,A Clean Movie,"My family and I really liked this movie,for the simple fact that there was no profanity in it. However, there was one part in the movie in the older couple's romance where the young stud was dancing with an old lady that creeped us out a little. Plus the little boy and girls relationship was a little far-fetched but, other than these two flaws it was a cute movie and was well worth the price."
4,A good beginners overview,"I think all the DK series books are interesting to read. Sailing is such a varied topic that illustrations are important to help the reader quickly grasp the concepts. I read and enjoyed Sailing for Dummies, but wish I had bought the DK Complete Saiing Manual first. I used it to supplement my sailing lessons. Although it is not as in-depth as Chapman's, I feel this is a great book to introduce beginning sailors to the many areas of sailing such as sailing basics, weather and cruising. Once a reader has the overall basics from this book, then learning the extensive details offered in a volume such as Chapman's will seem more easily digestible."
1,"It's boring, dull and weird all thrown in a blender.","This movie is loaded with nothing but weirdness, bad writing, forgettable characters, boring action scenes, slow plot progression and mediocre camerawork. There is literally nothing cool about this movie other than a few action scenes, ""G.I. Samurai"" goes nowhere from start to finish. 2.5/10"
3,Solid B-movie entertainment,"This movie is about a small group of Japanese GIs who enter a time warp and are transported back about 300-400 years during Japan's warring states period and do battle with the samurai.You would expect that the GIs would slaughter the samurai, who lack modern firearms and explosives, but because the GIs are so vastly outnumbered, they have a heck of a fight on their hands.This movie wastes little time with plot or characterization and most of the movie focuses on overlong, underproduced battle scenes that get somewhat tiresome after awhile.However, I felt that the long action scenes indicated a sincere effort on the part of the filmmakers to make a film that is at least entertaining, if not particularly thoughtful.I would recommend watching this one on a lazy Saturday morning over a bowl of Capn Crunch, but don't kill your Friday or Saturday night with this one, it's just not that good."
3,Time Slip (aka GI Samurai) Two-Disc Special Edition,"Time Slip (aka GI Samurai) Two-Disc Special EditionThis film makes us discover that often the appearance is misleading and that obviousness can destroy illusion. To cross the time and to meet the man of honour is not an easy thing but declaring war to them, you will see who wins. If you like the samurai try this one."
5,I red it and I passed it,This is the excellent book for the self-test and quick score improving study before real exam. I read it 3 times before test and found out where is my weakness. It was very helpful for my exam. I even found many questions in NCCAOM exam were very similar like those in these book. They may copy some questions from these books
4,Check it before you buy,"Although it is a very good book for preparing any acupuncture examination, it may be not the one you need. Before I bought this book I checked the content and sample of questions on the website namaa.org to make sure that was what I needed. I believe that all reader should do the same to avoid disappointment."
3,NCCAOM ACUPUNCTURE EXAMINATION,"HELPFUL WHEN YOU ARE NOT AT SCHOOL ANYMORE BUT HAS SOME ERRORS, ANYWAY CHEKING THEM HELPS DOING THE REVIEW."
5,very entertaining and informative reading,One of the best books I have read about Chinese culture and society.
3,Abridged edition,"I was looking for an unabridged edition of Heidi on CD, and I'm disappointed that this was not clearly shown in the description. I'm adding this information here for others who hopefully will find this helpful."
3,Disappointing...but I want more,"As preparations are made for the 10th anniversary of Babylon 5, President John Sheridan (Bruce Boxleitner) receives advice from the techno-mage Galen (Peter Woodward) to assassinate a Centauri prince (Keegan MacIntosh) he is escorting, and Colonel Lochley (Tracey Scoggins) deals with what appears to be a case of demonic possession.This first installment of a potential direct-to-DVD series was clearly shot on the cheap. The sets are spare and extras are almost non-existent, making creator JM Straczynski's universe feel positively abandoned. The lack of a budget is also reflected in the short running time. On the plus side, the CGI is terrific. Hopefully, any future installments will feature a bit more action, as these two stories are extremely talky, particularly Lochley's section. It is my impression that the fans have gotten behind this release despite the aforementioned problems, so maybe Straczynski will have a bigger budget next time."
3,An enjoyable treat for B5 Fans,"I loved the original series and was disappointed by the first episode which could be titled Lochley meets the Exorcist. It was boring and preachy. I may be tainted as Lochley was never my favorite character and I always considered her as ""the part of Susan Ivanova will now be played by Tracy Scoggins"" due to the contract dispute between JMS and Claudia Christian.The second installment is more like the original series. Plots within Plots within Plots, usually with Sheridan in the middle. It appears that JMS is stretching the history of the Earth Alliance out beyond the reign of Centauri Emperor Vir. Perhaps one day we will see David Sheridan and Prince Vintari take up the mantle of leadership for good or bad.I enjoyed the production over all but it seemed like something was missing. Hopefully there will be a new episode soon with Jerry Doyle and Walter Koenig reprising their roles to bring the Mr. Bester Arc to a close."
4,"1st part ehhh, 2nd part great","I love B5. So I just had to get this. The first part focuses on Lockley. I hate that character. I just do and not just because she replaced Sheridan. Her character is just anathema to me. She blindly fought for Earth when they were so obviously wrong and never apologized for it. And it still seems that she hasn't learned her lesson about taking stands for the right reasons.The second part was all what's good about B5. Excelent characters, horrible moral dilemmas, humor, you got it all here. If this DVD was only the first part, I would have been sorely disappointed but it redeems itself with the second part."
2,Disappointing,We expected one movie with all of the Babylon 5 cast. It was more like two shows with few of the cast.
3,It was okay to be back in the B5 Universe,"People have probably already described the plots of both stories to death by now, and chances are if you're a fan of B5 you raced out to get this like I did. However, as soon as it was over I was disappointed frankly. While they were both solid sub-plots neither one of those felt as grand as tales usually told in the B5 universe.I can only hope next time they steer away from this multiple story deal and go fro a full DVD length feature on the Telepath War, Sheridan's Son, what happened to Lennier after he tried to kill Sheridan, or something to that effect. A real ending for Crusade. Something the fans have been clamoring for not this ecumenical b/s or a lame premise based around Sheridan killing a guy who's innocent at the moment."
2,Unimpressed ...,"I'm not sure why the producers even decided to release this DVD. There's hardly anything worth seeing. The special effects look just like they did in the original series. Compared with the special effects in Battlestar Galactica (the new series), this DVD looks archaic.The stories are a waste of time -- you just don't care about them. You basically just get to see less than a handful of the original crew.Save your money and rent it."
3,Rip off on fans's support,"The Lost Tales from the Babylon 5 series left alot to be desired. While it is fun to have a new episode, it really is only one episode even though it is published as two. The first 'episode' is only 22 minutes in length! Considering what the DVD costs it is a rip off to the consumer. The entire DVD is only a little over an hour of program material."
3,Wished for more,"It was nice to see another installment, but sadly it only includes a few of the original cast. My feeling after watching the two-part DVD was, ""Is that it?!"""
2,Trading on the Name,"I was really disappointed with this DVD. I am a big B5 fan and to me this seemed like a cheap, low budget attempt to make money off of the name. The stories were interesting, but I expected more."
4,"Great, but I want more","It was fantastic to see new B5 material via DVD. Since JMS was behind this, I expected to be completely overwhelmed. Unfortunately, it fell just a tad short of overwhelming. My biggest complaint is that the two short stories were just over 30 minutes each, and that isn't a lot of time to develop a complex story line. I have to admit that I chuckled at some of the lines, especially in the last story with Sheridan...""Is that a new dress?"" And the tribute to Andre Katsulas and Richard Biggs was touching (""They are out there together beyond the rim""). The short running time was the only one reason I rated this 4 of 5 stars. I finished watching, and want MORE! I can only hope that new DVDs come out, and I will buy them. This is the perfect media for JMS, where he doesn't have to bow to the dumbing-down networks. Cheers, and I recommend the DVD."
1,Unbelievably bad.,"OMG, I can't believe how horrible the 2 stories are on this dvd. Two short, very boring episodes consisting of 2 to 3 actors basically chatting with each other. No real drama, no suspense... nothing interesting at all. The two shows on this dvd don't even have the ""feel"" of B5. When I got to the end of the second part I couldn't believe that that was it.Save your money."
2,The Last Tales,"I am a HUGE B5 fan from the start and think that B5 was probably the best show ever written, but the Lost Tales should be renamed as the Last Tales as they were awful. I expect so much more from JMS and was highly disappointed. I bought the DVD and wish I had rented it instead. These short stories show that JMS must be getting too old and slowing down and not as good as he once was. If this is the kind of stories he is going to release in the future, I hope he does no more of them because I'd hate B5 to end on a bad note."
4,Good,"As a Babylon 5 fan I'm excited just with the idea of something new in the series. There are two stories within The Lost Tales. In the first one you can appreciate the changes in visual effects more accurately since you have the original episodes to compare to regarding the main station. The dialogues are interesting and the camera angles are very interesting.The other ""tale"" which, I admit, was the one I enjoyed the most, brings new light to the future of Babylon 5 since it takes place 10 years after Sheridan assumes his Presidency.I recommend the viewers to check out the special features in the DVD, it'd help you appreciate all the effort behind B5 and to me at least, one of the best features was the tribute.Perhaps this won't fulfill everyone's expectations, then again, if you are a B5 fan then you just got to have it."
2,Recommendation,"Babylon 5 was an excellent series and we were looking forward to The Lost Tales even though the majority of cast members weren't involved. Unfortunately, we were pretty disappointed with this DVD. Actors did a good job, but after watching, felt like this was just something thrown together to put the Babylon 5 name on it and sell a few movies. Let's hope for a full-fledged Babylon 5 reunion film."
2,"Yes, a disappointment","I love everything Babylon 5.I have all the DVDs and i tell people howgreat a series B5 was, especially seasons 3 and 4.I saw this latest 2 story, made for video release the last week of July.The 1st story was....well boring and short. There was a slight tie in tothe second story which was better and more like the old series, but italso was short and i was left wondering where is the rest of this story?It could have been the beginning of a pretty good episode.This morning i watched the 1st episode of B5 the fifth season and itwas twice as good as ""The Lost Tales""If you have seen that episode before, you know what to expect.Of course I'll buy the next video when it comes out.Heres hoping fora better effort then.By the way a friend bought Lost Tales off the shelf at full price, atleast I paid 10 bucks less by buying here."
4,A very elegant addition to the B5 Universe,"I just watched the movie and I have to say that I loved it. Both the physical and 3D sets were well done, the acting was spot on, the stories were intriguing, well written, well acted, mellow, and cost effective. The special effects were very up to date with great looking detail. I loved the new ships, the short battle scene, and the ""feel"" of this movie. All in all while it wasn't an action packed movie persay, if had heart, and it filled me with a sense of welcome. I think this movie was a very good start to what I hope will be many more direct to DVD B5 movies to come."
4,Good continuation of B5,Excellent story and solid acting make this LOST TALES disc a lot of fun. I am hoping it does well enough to make more in this series because the B5 universe is deep and expansive. The special FX in this release are the best B5 effects you will ever see.The increased FX budget coupled with tech advancements make the station look better than it ever had.I recommend it wholeheartedly for B5 fans. A must own.
3,"I really, really tried to like it.","I have all the box sets, built the Starfury model, even watched the repeats on Sci-Fi. I had was looking forward to this DVD. And when it was over I felt empty.It was OK. Not great. OK. The actors looked great, the CGI was much better than the series thanks to the march of technology, but the stories were lacking something. Life, punch, whatever it was.If JMS does it again, give us Psi Corp and that battle. Bring back Lita and Bester. PLEASE!"
2,Didn't Measure up to the Original Series,"I was a rabid fan of the show in the 90s and have all the dvd's. I am sorry folks, but this did not measure up to the show I enjoyed 10 years ago. I miss the stations full of people and aliens, the zocalo, busy corridors on the station, and the moldy & sleezy down below. An original episode of B5 would have several different characters and plots going on at the same time. There was not enough going on in the background that painted the tapestry of the old B5. The B5 station didn't even have the same feel to it.As far as extras go, the memorial was the best part of the dvd.The sock puppets was really stupid and should have been left out. If it was a joke from the conventions, it just doesn't translate onto the dvd. And we are tired of JMS's arrogant attitude.I understand it may have been written for the fans in mind, but I think the fans deserve better."
4,"Yet another ""wish I could give 3.5 stars"" review","It's Babylon 5, without a doubt. The episodes were a bit quiet and much more philosophical than I was expecting -- and the use of green screen shows quite a bit in some places. On the other hand, the actual special effects are much better than anything in the show's past.The DVD has two related, but separate stories -- more or less like episodes of the series. Was it good? Good enough (and much better than ""Legend of the Rangers"" or ""The River of Souls"".) I hope they make more.For anyone griping about the price, do you or do you not want more Babylon 5? You're essentially funding the show (no network to interfere!) by buying the DVD."
3,Babylon 5- The Lost Tales,I love Babylon 5. That being said. What was this all about?Tieing up loose ends? Last gasp? I missed something. Oh it was done ok.But hollow somehow.
3,Better than Nothing,"I am a big Babylon 5 fan and had high hopes for this DVD. My reaction is quite mixed. Yes, it is a continuation of B5, but at a greatly diminished scale. Each story only has a few characters acting on minimal or virtual sets. The first story is a tacky exorcist sort of thing that has no place in a scifi context. The second story, with Sheridan, is much better and almost worthy of the original show. Bruce B easily slips back into the role of Sheridan befriending a Centauri prince. I hope that the quality of the stories improves on following discs. A good point is that the special effects are much more sophisticated than those of the original show."
4,Very good!,This DVD was very good. It was definitely Babylon 5. It was weird and funny. I was happy to see Bruce Boxleitner back. I also enjoyed the out-takes and interviews. The memorial for Andreas and Richard was very touching.
2,i was hopeing for more,well 1st am a big fan of Babylon 5 and love that we are getting these new dvd releases but i cant say this one is as good as the other dvdsbut as a Babylon 5 fan this is a mustif just to see some of the old casts and give hope for more dvd releases in the future
3,Always good to see old friends.......,"Despite limitations from this DVD, let's remember that it was done, as much as anything, to give the fans something new. It wasn't a whole new, big budget TV series. Personally, I could've done without the whole plot split, with more focus on one area, but the price of admission was worth it just to hear ""Sheridan"" bellow, ""UP YOURS!""...one more time."
4,I'd definitely buy more!,"I loved -- and still love -- Babylon 5. I think it's among the very best television science fiction. I went into ""Lost Tales"" knowing that it wouldn't have the immediacy of the unfolding story the original series had, just because it's a couple of ""short stories,"" rather than being part of the ""novel."" And, in fact, what we have here is something like a couple of Twilight Zone episodes.That said, I really enjoyed it, particularly the second (and longer) segment with Sheridan and Galen. Boxleitner and Woodward both fell right back into character, and their interaction was wonderful. I enjoyed the first part of the story with Lochley also, but not as much. That story felt a little more static -- and both stories suffered from not enough money for sets and extras.But I very much hope that Straczynski gets to make more of these Lost Tales DVDs, and I'll be first in line to buy them if he does!"
2,Babylon 5: Left Behind,"The two stories on this DVD were obviously produced inexpensively and bear little resemblance to the TV show. As a fan of Babylon 5 I feel cheated.The first story takes Babylon 5's religious undertone and rams it in your face. It's more silly than entertaining or enlightning.The second story is a little better, but would be more suited as a sub-plot in a regular episode than a stand-alone story."
3,Missing something,Both stories are decent. Not having the whole cast on hand for the Lost Tales hurts this series though. The reason I liked the second story better is because there is more interaction between the main character and the secondaries.I can see JMS building upon the story he started here throughout the lost tales. I look forward to more of these tales.
3,The modern definition of low budget,"As a B5 fan, I was looking forward to see this new DVD. I was hoping for something better than the ""Legend of the Rangers"". I have to say I was not pleased with what I saw. This must be the modern definition of low budget. Barely any actors, almost no sets, just green screens and two stories which are the equivalent of average to bad episodes in the middle of a regular season. I rated this with a generous 3 starts just because one more time I get the same sense of sadness watching Sheridan walk towards death that I felt while watching the end of the series many years ago. Also, I gave it 3 stars to recognize JMS courage to continue forward and trying to revive the story in some form or another. Still, base on the last two attempts, I think is time to let it go or bring someone new to become the driving creative force behind B5."
3,Good stories but cheap production,"I am a long time B5 fan. I was looking forward to getting the Lost Tales DVD as I have always enjoyed the franchise.The two stories on the DVD are very well written and reflect some of the other thoughtful tales in seasons 2 - 4 (forget season 5). BUT... here are the negatives:1. Not enough story content for the money.2. Only a few characters from the series were actually in the story.3. Cheap production... but the CGI was very good.If you are a die hard B5 fan... buy it. But be aware that this is only a ""shadow"" of B5's fomer self."
4,Lost Tales Very Welcome,"""The Lost Tales"" was well worth ordering and viewing. As the original ""vorlon13,"" I was touched by the storyline, and particularly liked the tributes to Andreas Katsulas and Richard Biggs. References to their characters were tastefully integrated into the storyline. Lost Tales was a fresh blast back to some of my favorite memories, with contemporary (stunning) special effects. Although it could not possibly have the same impact as episodes from the original series, it revived my hunger for the B5 universe and what it represented. Please, JMS, continue this with additional episodes..."
4,"A Good B5 Ep, But The Other Movies Are Better","Well, I did enjoy this ""movie"", but it really was 2 short episodes, or short stories, that just showed the viewer what is going on in the B5 universe. However, the other movies, Legend Of The Rangers, Thirdspace, Call To Arms, etc..., were much better. This ""movie"" was nice to see, but it was just a glimps into the B5 Universe. After watching this movie, you will leave vaguely satisfied, and wishing for a LOT more.Please understand that I will purchase every B5 DVD that comes out, and I do not want to sound like I didn't enjoy this movie, I DID! The problem is that it's just too short! (IMHO)"
3,"wow, what a disapointment.","I'm a huge B5 fan.Loved the show, watch it everytime it's on (which hasn't been for a while).So when a friend loaned me his copy of The Lost Tales, I couldn't wait to watch it!In a word, bad.Weak stories.Three actors from the original series over two eps?Almost felt like it was filmed in an office building with colored foam rails glued to the walls.The original Star Trek series looked like it had a bigger budget to work with.I'm very disapointed."
2,Babylon 5 - The lost Tales,"What can I say - Like all B5 fans around the world I could not wait to watch the long awaited ""Lost Tales"". In the past the Babylon 5 series and movies have been outstanding in story line, visuals, and acting.Disappointment and confusion. Those are words that come to mind after watching this DVD and this has been the same for other B5 fans I know.I understand that the production budgets are tight and as a result the visuals are a let down. All I can say is that every B5 fan should purchase a copy so that the revenue can go into future B5 projects."
2,"All Talk, Little Action","If you are a fan of long, dry discourse AND sci-fi, this is for YOU.If you are just a Babylon 5 fan looking for one last taste of a long-dead series, you will be left with a foul taste in your mouth. Blech.I was left feeling more annoyed than anything. Don't waste your money.2-star only because of the minor use of advanced CG."
3,Now appearing Off-Broadway...,"I just saw the B5: Lost Tales DVD. While it is nice to see new B5 stories, the two presented in this series are more suited for a stage adaptation. There is very little of the epic sweep that the series had.Essentially, each story is an extended conversation between two or three characters. While the conversations are occasionally interesting, they really don't remind me of the glory days of B5. They remind me more of the off-off Broadway shows I see in downtown. Low budget, one or two set pieces, people sitting around and talking.(And really - after ten years, the first new offical B5 story features Tracey Scoggins and a priest? I like Lochley okay, but she is probably one of the least essential characters in regards to the B5 mythology. What, Claudia Christian and Jerry Doyle were too busy? C'mon now!)I really hope that JMS is gearing up for something more epic. I give it 3 stars due to my love of the franchise, but want something more next time."
3,Just for the fans,"I loved B5. I have seen it many times. But even before the end, I felt the story had run out of steam.Here are two episodes both in quality are below average. For a writer of the ability of Michael Straczynski, I expected something much better.Nothing new with the characters.The filming is okay they obviously did not spend much in making these episodes.If you are into B5 like me then you have to watch like it otherwise I would suggest you go elsewhere."
1,Should Stay Lost Tales,"While the storyline is excellent, the acting and the cast were rough to say the least. I am a long time fan of B5, but this movie is not worth the time to watch. There are only a few of the original actors involved and the sets are not up to par even with those of the television series. Save your money and look to B.S.G. for a better buy."
4,lost tales,"The 1st ""tale"" had some story flaws. The second was more in keeping of what I have come to enjoy about Babylon 5. I think that most Babylon 5 fan will find this a worth while."
4,nice back drop stories,I was always a huge B5 fan and wished the series had continued in addition to the spinoffs. This is a nice addition to the B5 universe and should provide some sustenance until the rumored B5 movie comes out...
4,Babylon 5 Extra,"The episodes were good, but it was clear the budget was low and alot of things were more inexpensively done. Other members of the original cast would have helped, along with more information on how other situations worked out (the poisoning of Earth, etc.). But I loved the series and enjoyed the episodes."
3,Good but capable of so much more,"Well, the Babylon 5 universe isn't completely dead with the direct to video release last week of ""Babylon 5:The Lost Tales"". As much as I like new material from B5 I can't say I was overwhelmed by this release. B5 was so groundbreaking, both in storytelling and in special effects. ""Lost Tales"" still has some good writing (JMS still composes a good speech and there is a nice tribute to Katsulas/G'Kar and Biggs/Dr. Franklin) and the principal actors do a good job but the effects and scenery seem very bare bones. It's a shame that it seems like the franchise has almost taken a step back. Even the made-for-TV movies were better. With the excellent writing and loyal fanbase I can't believe someone like Scifi Channel wouldn't support B5; this could not have been more expensive (except for actors' salaries) than the dreck that's usually on Saturday night. As disappointed as I am I'm still hoping for more (and better) videos in the future."
1,Not Worth It,"Don't buy! This DVD appears to have been assembled from episodes that were not good enough for SCIFI channel reruns (yes,that BAD). The plot lines are terrible. Additionally, the same episodes can be downloaded for free from various movie websites."
1,The worst PoS I have ever bought......,"Save your money!!!! This episode with only a few actors sucks. Very boring with no action. I am going to return mine (friend brought his over to watchafter I bought mine already) ASAP. J. Michael Straczynski said at the ComicCon that they would not make anymore episodes if this one does not sell well. Good, they should not have made this one."
2,VERY Disappointing!!!!,"Like many fans of B5, I was excited to hear of the Lost Tales and yes I saw JMS at NY Comic Con, too.I just finished watching The Lost Tales and can't even put into words how disappointing it is.Call me old fashioned but I don't enjoy a whole CGI release. The people are real at least, well for the most part.Ugh, I am just too disgusted to write anymore!"
2,Why Why Why ?,I loved the show and was really looking forward to this - POINTLESS.Why make this ridiculous DVD? 72 minutes after all these years?Okay the 2 stories are MILDLY interesting but there is NO POINT. Maybe if they are about to start something new ?Make a real freakin' movie or mini-series but please - don't waste my time and money on junk like this.
2,Poor attempt at B-sides of Bab5,"wuddu wasta time we have here, just a lot of pointless stories that do not tie in with the regular season except for showing a few characters here and there and failed marriages. Like we care about that at this point in the timeline? I think everyone giving this thing 5 stars is smoking something and it is STRONG becuz this really duz not add much to the overall B5 story."
2,75 minutes ?,"Run time: 75 minutes.Are they kidding? For two stories? That means each one is less than the length of an episode.As Ivanova once said in a classic episode of Babylon 5, ""I'll wait in the car.""Rather than assume its going to be good, I'll wait to hear if someone whose opinion I respect gives it a thumbs up."
1,Bad,JMS and company were never ever to recapture the magic B5 held once B5 ended. Every movie and every show after B5 just gets progressively worse than the last thing they did.
3,"Okay, but a bit of a disappointment in light of the other shows.","I'm a huge Babylon 5 fan. And I'm sorry they did not continue the show Crusade, but the Lost Tales just wasn't up to par with the other shows. I think I may have enjoyed the features as much or more than the lost tales themselves. They kind of seemed like just teasers so you would want to see more. I would like to see more, but these just weren't that great."
3,Babylon 5: The Lost Tales,"The two tales where done in a lower budget feel, but I still like the stories and was glad to add it to my collection. I wish they would have done some more higher budget tales like one with Michael getting even for the corp messing with his head."
4,The end of B5,It was a good way to end B5. I would have liked to see the series continue but this wraps it up nicely.
1,There is a reason why it's straight to video,"If this is what Babylon 5 has become, it should be put out of it's misery. The effects are great, unfortunetly that's all that is great. The story line and acting are less than that of the original series and seem to be two parts of two different, two part episodes. The sets are very minimal with barely a peek back into the big baby. The second part with Sheridan has a little flair but the budget shows when they don't even suit up for the starfury trip, a cheap way out of making the costumes. With all the dialog trying to be cerebral, there is a real lack of action. Strike that, No Action. Galen is the only character who's acting is up to par and I wish that there was more featuring him. The price is pretty high, I imagine that it will drop after the ""suckers"" have bought their copies, look for it in the bargin bin in a few weeks."
1,Beyond Disappointment,"Babylon 5, probably the best sci-fi vehicle ever made for television, bears little or no resemblance to this pointless sampler. These two short films will leave you wondering when the real Babylon 5 episodes will begin, and when will these terrible trailers be over? Oh, they're not trailers, this is the actual content. Well, maybe I can re-gift it to someone I don't like. The two pointless, irrelevant stories here will leave you wishing for more made-for-TV post-series movies instead of this. The only reason I can conceive of for having made it in the first place is BRUCE AND TRACY NEED MONEY.If you really appreciated the original series, it's engaging and bold plots, it's excellent characters and acting, the way it beautifully reflected contemporary issues, and just astoundingly good story telling, this DVD will leave you in tears of remorse. Keep your memories of B5 intact and stay away from this title. I dearly wish I could un-watch it."
1,Babylon5-The Lost Tales,I absolutely loved the series but this new 'movie' stinks so bad I think I want a refund. Boring! ANYONE who says they liked it must work for theproduction company.
2,Is this all?,"Disappointing! Where is all the action? The two story lines lead you to a point and then that was it. Where were all the special effects? Lots of sci-fi scenery but compared to the original show, disappointing. Also too short for two story lines. I'll wait to hear more if they plan to do a second DVD before purchasing."
3,Not as great as I had hoped,"The two stories were interesting, especially the science vs. religion morality tale of the first story. The best thing about the two movies was definitely the visuals. The special effects and CGI definitely were a major upgrade from the series and both stories looked amazing. Action and plot were missing something, I think each story could have benefitted from being longer and more involved."
3,"Nice stories, but...","I was surprised to only find two stories instead of the three that were expected. It saddens me to say this, but I think it might have been better to not have had anything instead of what was put out there. JMS is an amazing writer and was able to do a lot with little, but it still missed the mark in some places. I want some more B5, but I don't foresee anything coming anytime soon."
2,I really enjoy JMS but...,"Sometimes he just talks too much. It works for the first story, but for the next... sigh. Teasing me with a intense action scene to show how it's going to happen was hellishly stupid. Topping that off with a lame >Look at the DEVASTATION soon to happen< gives off a chould've-should've-would've setup that will never pay off. The topping on all of those other toppings is the sad ""Look at all this Special Effects!!!"" plea. Locked cameras with a green screen do not impress. They do not impress me in Galatica and they do not impress me here. Good acting to salve me ire at the very..oh so very lest."
4,Please sir may we have some more.,"The DVD is well worth buying for any B5 fan. It has 2 short episodes loosely connected. It would be nice to have more Lost Tales DVDs.The Good:-The second short episode was very much in the vain of B5 and I enjoyed very much.-CGI was excellent, although more would have been a treat.-The acting was oustanding, it seemed like the 3 main original cast never left their roles. The interaction between Galen and Sheridan was particuliarly engaging. The young actor playing the Prince was also quite good.-nice extras on DVDThe Bad-The lack of extra cast, shortness of each episode, short CGI shots implies WB is pinching pennies. This is pretty stupid if they want to revive an established franchise with a large fan base.-The first episode I found jarring because it really felt like I was watching Twilight zone instead of B5, but once I got used to it was more enjoyable."
1,Bad beyond description,"I can't believe they wasted their time doing this DVD. I'd quote Cartman from South Park, but this review would get deleted.The first part turned me off totally. Mediocre metaphysical BS with Satan and his minions banished by 'God' to the outer reaches of space until mankind can begin to despair and seek God again. What piffle.I fell asleep during the second part it was so boring.The third part was closer to what I was expecting from MJS and crew. It had echoes of past grandeur. I really wish they had spared us some of the extras.I had my hopes raised when I first ordered this. Those hopes were then dashed upon the rocks of mediocrity while viewing. A pity..."
1,yuck,"How sad. We were looking forward to some new Babylon 5.But yecch, this was some awful leftover scripts, and lousy acting (would have been hard to do any better though, with such pathetic dialog writing), in 2 boring uninteresting stories.And what's this childish, dull Christian religious garbage doing, in a B5 story?"
1,Bait and Switch,The photography and graphics are good. The acting is just fine. But there is very little in the way of a story. This might have been fine for one TV episode of an ongoing series but for $15.00 this faux movie was only produced to steal my money.
2,I love Babylon 5 but not this travesty,"I've stuck with B5 through it all but no one could have saved this slow motion train wreck. I wasn't impressed with the CGI but I could have forgiven that if the storyline had been compelling. It wasn't. It was complete nonsense.Aside from a few sparse sets, the entire movie is shot in front of a blue-screen in quality usually reserved for porn. No one looked comfortable and everyone of them appeared to struggle to read from cue cards. Any promise the opening held is nuked within five minutes. It painful to hear how many of the previous actors from the show ""couldn't make it.""I love my B5 but these tales should have stayed lost."
5,Still Great Babylon 5!,"True, it's ""bare bones"" Babylon 5, but the writing is great, the stories compelling and it satisfied my hunger for more after the last Babylon 5 episodes. Also included are some fun, silly clips of Straczynski, the actors and crew. The memorials to the actors Andreas Katsulas and Richard Biggs were meaningful to me. Glad I bought ""The Lost Tales"" to complete my Babylon 5 Collection."
2,When is the main course arriving?,"Weak stories, brilliant CGI so really just a starter. Hopefully we will get the main course in the future. Also think 70-75 minutes is really too short to run two main story lines."
2,Better CGI ... no budget to put it to effective use ...,"The extras and cast were minimal and the sets were lackluster. The first story was ridiculous ... the second was standard B5. The CGI was a great improvement, but not used effectively.Overall, a disappointment. I really hope someone considers a serious budget for this franchise."
2,Disappointing,"1. A step up from sock puppets. 2. Only a very few actors. 3. Cost-effective CGI backgounds. 4. Talking heads. If this is the bare-bones beginning for a series of Lost Tales, then fine; everyone go out and buy it to show WB that Joe should continue. No Delenn, no Kosh, no G'Kar, no Garibaldi, no Londo, no Vir -- this is a serious handicap to the small, personal stories that the Lost Tales purport to be. Why? Personal interaction is intrinsic to the lifes of Lochley and Sheridan. It is impossible to believe that either of these stories happened because of the lack of it; constant interaction was at the heart of the series. Here's hoping for vast improvement in the next release."
1,Huge Disappointment,"Don't waste your money on this huge disappointment! I love the B5 series and was hoping for a Legend of the Rangers type movie. This DVD was nothing more than two 30 minute episodes glued together, both of which went nowhere. I also was surprised to see such a religion based story for the first episode. I thought that was both inappropriate and a bad story that went nowhere. The second episode with Sheridan showed some potential, but also went nowhere in the end. I would sum up this DVD as an hour of nothing! I can't believe JMS couldn't even come up with 90 minutes of content for B5 fans! I would like my money back. I hope they do a lot better with the next one. I suggest a story like Legend of the Rangers where something actually happens!"
1,Yuk,Can I give it negative stars. Only the two characters from the original show. 2 Stories told mostly as a narrative. Very Weak.
2,A low-budget mistake.,"As a B5 fan, I was very disappointed in this obviously low-budget spinoff. Clearly, they used only a very small cast to save money; I can't rememeber the halls of B5 being so empty, even the ship arrival area. And the plotlines of the two stories are, at best, nonsensical (I can't say more without spoilers).Belongs right down there, below ""The Legend of the Rangers""."
5,don't listen to the naysayers,"The Lost Tales is meant to be a collection of short stories set in the Babylon 5 universe, not an epic or a continuation of the original story arc. You will only be disappointed with TLT if you have false expectations of liking B5 by starting with this or it being serialized. If you are a longtime fan of B5 and you love these characters, TLT will do wonders for you. Oh, and the special effects are fanastic...done by the same people who did BSG's FX."
2,Ditto Jerry Kindall,"I was going to write a long, thoughtful review. Then I saw that Jerry Kindall had written virtually everything I wanted to say. Read his review.In summary, ""The Lost Tales"" is a shadow (heh) of the B5 we knew and loved. Don't waste your money."
3,Lost Tales Babylon 5,"Great to see some fresh stories from this underated science fiction series. And pleasantly surprised to see the original actors back.Excellent SGI, high quality production. Only complaint would loved to have seen longer stories and more of the original cast."
4,Avid Babylon 5 Fan,"I enjoyed the Lost Tales very much. My only disappointment was that there should have been more tales. Otherwise, the production and stories were outstanding. The memorials to Richard Biggs and Andreas Katsulas were touching and appropriate."
3,Good beginning,"It was a good start to a new series of lost tales. I sppreciated Tracy Scoggins maintaining a larger role on the station and I appreciated, too, the tactical shift made by Sheridan when meeting and corresponding with the Centarian Ambassador. The dialogue was good, the special effects were great, and Lockley was out of this world Gorgeous! I expect to see many more new episodes of JMS's version of the Dead Sea Schrolls!"
3,Very short but interesting,"I enjoyed this DVD. But it was very short for the money. After I watched it I thought, ""Is that all?"" However, it was wonderfully philosophical..."
3,Babylon 5 - The Lost Tales,Being a real Babylon 5 fan I was excited to see that there was something new to watch and quickly purchased this disk. I must say that I probably enjoyed the tributes to the fallen cast members more then I did the 2 episodes on the disk. Overall I was disappointed that only a couple of the original characters were represented here.
3,"Glad, but Dissapointed and Worried","I'm glad the series is continuing. I hope the direct-to-DVD idea really prospers, but only the IDEA prospering, not just the producers. I'm dissapointed that I'm charged so much for two 35 minute episodes of only mediocre B5 quality. I'm worried that JMS and/or Warner only view the series as a cash-cow, and not as a tradition we'd like to continue. I'm worried that the special features were about twice as long (or so it seemed) as the 'movie', and pretty much featured JMS in all His aspects. WILL the next DVD be with sock puppets?"
5,J Michael does it again!,"I impatiently waited for this DVD and was very pleased upon viewing it. Of the two stories, the first is my favorite, but the second story ran so close to it that it was a difficult choice to make.KEEP THEM COMING!!"
4,Not as bad as other view it,"I am a serious fan of Babylon 5 and although the glory days seem tobe behind it, the two stories presented did bring back some of theemotions associated with the saga. Both stories were snippets ofBabylon 5 life and had hints of greater potential for expansion.The first tale hints of supernatural belief in the Babylon 5universe and dealing with things that were viewed as just biblicalstories. Lockley's encounter seem to show otherwise and herresolution added to her character.The second story involves the interaction of the technomage andJohn Sheridan when presented with a devil's bargain. His solutionwas what I hoped it would turn out to be but was entertainingnever the less.Both tales were filmed on a small budget, so there weren't much tothe special effects, but there were some extras included that fanswould find interesting."
2,Kept the Characters not the Writing,"I caught a couple of the lost tales that someone posted to YouTube. I own all 5 seasons of the series. They manged to used the characters the sets with poorer productions values. What really blows it is the writing. From what I have seen everything is one dimensional. The depth and complexity that existed in story lines and characters is just not there. The original series is great, some of the movies OK, but The Lost Tales in my opinion can stay lost."
3,A Mixed Bag of Entertainment,"Somewhat uneven not only from clip to clip but within each of the three vignettes. Probably only recommended for real fans of the series who want to see more. The good parts are really very good and stand up against any other body of sci-fi. The less good parts are just that, less than good.It mad us want to watch the whole series again."
2,Yawn Fest,It was nothing more then talking and political posturing. I liked Babylon because it had juicy back stories as well as action packed. I am deeply disappointed this is the most boring movie for b5 I have ever seen. I have seen all the others they where great but I regret waisting 15 dollars on this.
3,New B5 : 50% is absolutely Great!,"The new Babylon 5 DVD contains two stories, the first was very slow, nothing happened, a lot of talk, only Elizabeth Lochley is a known character but Tracy Scoggins was not at her best in this episode. Maybe the substance was good but how it was told not.The second story was far better, typicly a Babylon 5 story, two of my favorite characters (Galen & Sheridan), which helps of course, also a story which continues from the latter half of season 5. This one made ita good purchase for me. And of course because it's B5!"
2,I want my 75 minutes back,"Same cardboard acting as the tv show. You get two original cast regulars, eventhough everyone is mentioned... which is rather pointless.Nothing interesting in the stories, which seem to revolve around the most mundane subjects. Halfway through the second story, the episode ends.The graphics upgrades make it worth 2 stars, even if they are brief."
2,Not up to the Babylon 5 Standard,"I was very disappointed in this DVD.Just 2 episodes, and they weren't really that good."
2,Why did they make this?,"I love babylon 5. I was so excited to to see a new installment, but this latest edition seems like a weak attempt to make money off people like me. It's just 2 new episodes. It doesn't contribute anything to the overall story arc. It just puts familiar faces in new situations and brings them to conclusion. I thought the 1st half with the new female captain was somewhat silly. A demonic posession episode? Come on. It had too many religious (Catholic mythology) overtones.I'd rather see Strazynski make movies out of the novels that came after the series ended; stuff about the psicorps, the technomages, Centauri Prime etc. This is just a sad attempt to score a few bucks off us loyal B5 fans."
1,Gasping For Air,"I loved the original series, but it ended. The storyline lived a greatand spectacular 5 years, then faded away. However, it seems that ""Joe"" andthe ""Warners"" are trying to resurrect it in some bizarre fashion.I just watched The Lost Tales DVD, it should have stayed Lost!!!! I reallyshould rewatch it I suppose to see if some glimmer into the mind of the""SockPuppet"" master can be revealed. Yes, I said ""SockPuppet""! Sorry, nospoilers will be told here. BUT, I ask you, would YOU buy an awaited DVDthat features your most beloved B5 Universe and the word ""SockPuppet""?This is the first review of any type I've ever tried to write and it morethan likely shows. All I can say is that I am ""TERRIBLY"" disappointed withthe DVD and consider it one the worst purchases I've ever made.At least I have the series on DVD and maybe watching it a few times willeventually drive the bad taste of The Lost Tales away."
2,I Wouldn't Steal This Movie!,"I own all B5 seasons on DVD, and even got a hold of the Excalibur episodes. With that said, this movie is excaclty what you think it might be and less!Lets face it, after the shadow wars, theres just nothing left!Save your money and buy some treats for when Stargate Atlantis comes back on!!"
3,"important subject, okay treatment","Relationships between consumer culture and the economy seem central to understanding contemporary social life. To date the economics discipline has not been up to the task, focused as it is on things like financial markets and international trade, rather things like shopping and everyday life. Ben Fine's book is a good economic foray into consumption. It offers great diatribe against standard economic approaches to consumers and consumption. But it wanders around alot, lacks depth, and doesn't offer much in the way of new insights or perspectives. In short, while the subject of this book is important, one wishes it had been tackled more thoughtfully."
3,Informative if dull,"Not a book to be read for pleasure, this one struck me as very modern despite its subject. The beliefs of many of the Saints discussed are still being bought forth by liberals in America while the conservative predecessors still exist, claiming all problems belong to the individual. The idea that the welfare state is a new idea is quickly disproven when one sees all the great social welfare works set forth in the Byzantine era. I would have liked some comparison to the modern situation but it remains pretty informative and useful, especially for history-loving folks."
2,sappy ending,"I Hope this was worst of the Matthew Scudder series, since I bought quite a few. I read When the Sacred Gin Mill Closes and this was great writing. This was not terrible, but silly in parts, disjointed and not reasonable overall. The ending was utterly sappy. puh leez"
3,A disappointment,"Lawrence Block is my favorite detective author, and, as others have said, I couldn't wait to read this newest entry in the Scudder series. I was really disappointed. The plot seemed thin, but, more disturbingly, I felt like Block's usually strong supporting characters -- especially Elaine and T.J. -- were diluted and lifeless.In the past, I've had a hard time putting down any of the Scudder books. I actually had a difficult time finishing this one."
4,Block is back on track,"Block is back on track with a good junker reminiscent of Sanders' ""Deadly Sins"" books, but this one lacks the protagonist's deeper internal conflicts present in Block's very best ""Scudder"" books. Still, it's good to have Block approaching form again. This one's markedly better than ""Everybody Dies."""
2,Hackneyed Mess,"This is an unbelievably bad Lawrence Block novel. I suspect he may have owed his publisher a book after signing a big book deal. Or maybe he wanted to try to write something commercial. But this one is a big dud.It's not that his writing is bad. He's still very good with dialogue and style. However, the plot is horrible. His serial killer characterization is cliched, distasteful, and not believable.Block makes a mistake by alternating the first person narrative of Matt Schudder with the serial killer. It just doesn't work.I've read a lot of Lawrence Block novels, and this is one of the worst."
4,By far better than the 1965 version,"The original Cinderella with Julie Andrews is the only way to go. Full of catchy tunes and typical Rogers and Hamerstein music, any fan of musicals should own this CD. The 1957 version is by far the better version."
3,A FUNNY AND NOSTALGIC LOOK AT ROMANCE COMICS!,"Jeanne Martinet has written a very funny tongue-in-cheek retrospect look at the plethora of DC romance comics of the 1949's to 1970's. Leaving the artwork untouched, humorist Ms. Martinet literally rewrote the stories, and as a result has created new tales of ""betrayal and heartbreak by providing all-new word balloons and captions for each story. In short, Jeanne Martinet has retold the stories. . .my favorites include ""My Heart Said Yes, But My Therapist Said No!"". . . ""I Hate My Hair!"". . .and ""Ten Ways To Get Over A Broken Heart"". I enjoyed this book, but wish the author would have included more stories."
5,Took me back to the old days,"This was a delightful book, especially, if like me, you grew up on Love Comics. I read those probably from around 1958 - 1962. And, like the author said, that's why I'm screwed up about relationships today! Anyway, this book just made me laugh out loud through the whole thing. I especially enjoyed the one where the girl was in secretarial school, but it's been switched to a writing school, and she falls for the teacher. I loved the line of the main female character, ""Doesn't she know we're all going to die""? That's what these characters needed to hear 40 years ago! Give up the scholop and get real! LOL I also liked that the author summarized the original plot, to put it into perspective for us. Very, very much fun, and the comics are beautifully copied, especially the men's blue hair, with their floating heads above the women's beds!"
5,"Vintage comics, modern humour, hilarity ensues!","I'm not sure I've *ever* laughed so hard while reading a comic book. These stories would probably be funny satire of the romance genre on their own, but paired with vintage romance comic art they're downright hilarious.Highly recommended to anyone who's ever made snarky comments during a romantic comedy!"
5,Finding Her Way will make young adults appreciate Thoreau,"I seriously struggled through Thoreau in both high school and college. After reading Finding Her Way, I was actually enthused about picking up Thoreau for a new reading. Ms. Faigen has accomplished her goal in a literary and entertaining way; to make the ideas of Thoreau accessible to young readers, and give them an appreciation for a critical period of thought in American history."
4,What a perfect title,"If you are reading this then you know what the movie is about. Scumbag, controlling, philandering man has a mistress and when this married man can't have her all to himslef, he has her blinded with acid. He goes to prison, somehow they develop a correspondence, and when he gets out, they get married.CRAZY...CRAZY...CRAZY...LOVEIt is a wonderfully directed film that depicts the New York/Miami of yesteryear. It captures details and interviews these charactors that, simply, are not that prevalent anymore. This film, while being a documentary, is the epitome of extreme chauvinism.The most interesting thing about the film is that the victim is hardly, hardly sympathetic.A must see in the world of documentaries and very entertaining"
3,Okay but not great,"Believe me I am a very loyal William Johnstone fan but this lastest installment in the ""Code"" series does not live up to the first 2 books. After reading the first one I was hooked, the second even more, and now this one--I do not think so. I think Mr. Johnstone needs just to set back and wait awhile before putting out the fouth book, because if it is as bland as this one I wont read the fifth."
1,Code Name: Death,"I felt the author was rushed into publishing this book - it was significantly shorter than his other two Code Name books and the story line was extremly weak.The situations the Team found themselves in were too predictable and the solution way too easy. The main villian was never used to his full potential - despite his relevance to the storyline he was a secondary character.It was disappointing to me that the author put more detail into the porn scenes and physical descriptions of the prostitutes than he did the battles and research work done by the Team.I probably buy the next Code Name book . . . I'll just try to read more than the back cover before I do, though."
1,"""NO MORE FOR ME""!!!!!","Read the first two Code books and they were fair, this one is just not good at all. Don't plan on reading any more. This one is about a teenage prostitute who is missing. Her very rich Grandfather hires Barrone to find her. She comes up dead, then the Grandfather hires Barrone to find her killers. There just never was any story, except the making of porn movies. There was no depth of character study. Not enough detail on things that were going on. I really enjoyed the Eagles Series and the EARLY Mountain Man books. I quit reading them because each book had several pages of flashbacks to previous books. Now I will quit reading the Code Series. Appears to me Johnston is after quanity and not quality. I know it will make not difference to him if I read another one or not but it give me some satisfaction."

2,very very soft porn,"Originally a porn movie, this version has been cut for 40 minutes to become a sexy pirate movie. Not the real thing, as it has an R-rating."
1,Poor,Movie was not explained in description well enough. The movie was a poor rated R as there were no sexual scenes that should have been there. The copy had all the intimate scenes removed which I believe was the point to the purchase. I do not recommend this purchase if your expecting an actual adult movie.
2,dissapointed,"a really great plot. with original and new characters. has more action than I expected,I just wish I noticed that it was ""R"" rated."
3,Not what i thought.,I love the pirates movies and i thought this was the original one but many scenes are cut out to make it r-rated... i think if i would have read the reviews then i would have known that. Also it skips through and entire 2-3 scenes towards the end.
1,My gosh,"This DVD got to my house no problem, but the movie itself had a large amount cut from it. as i have seen it before. there was a great deal missing from this persons product. i would not suggest you buy from this person."
1,Blah...,"Blah... Very boring!! Blah is the best way to discribe this awful movie!!! Have your time and money, do not purchase the lame movie!!!!"
1,YUK!!,Is it possible to give a movie negative 5 stars! The next time I would rather flushing the $17!
1,"Good Movie, Not what you're wanting to see...","If you want the real thing you'll have to sacrifice the BD format and aquire it on DVD. It's like if you had an airplane but no gas...I mean, you want to see pornostars doing what they're famous for, not trying to actually play a role..."
4,It's not a porn if it has no porn,This is a quality product for those who wish to follow the film's storyline. As I found myself skipping through Pirates one just to get to the good scene this censored copy of Pirates 2 gave me the opportunity to appreciate the acting abilities of the cast. An intriguing and humorous tale that followed on from the first.The DVD was shipped quickly with only minor damage to the case.I do recommend the uncut version for true fans of Pirates
1,Lame and Cheesy,Do not buy this movie unless it is the full rated x version. The rated R version only has 2 sex scenes and is not worth the money.
1,R-Rated....really?,This movie was designed to be NR. How can it possibly be made into an R-rated movie and be expected to still succeed? smh
1,Do not buy this,"I bought this for my girlfriend and me to watch and just now realized after it shipped that I wasted my money. Amazon should pull this product, who edits porn to make it R-rated? What's the point? No one watches porn because of the great storytelling. My money would have been better spent if I would have burned it to create light and heat."
1,OH NO!!,"itially i thought this IS a big movie. you know what i mean. but NO it's NOT a big movie. it's a bunch of useless piece of crap. totally wasted of money. i threw away the movie after mostly fast-forward and it's the worst $ 15 i've ever spent. so please don't follow my footstep and save your money and spend on something else. i could've send back the movie to the seller but that mean i've to spend EXTRA $ 5 for the shipping. i just forget and move on from it. i just wanna let other people know before someone else fall into this "" trap"" thinking this IS the big movie. once again it's NOT a big movie!! please DON'T BUY IT!!"
2,Poor acting,The acting is poor compared to other Haley Mills movies. I enjoy the older movies but sure notice the differance in technology.
2,Cute Movie - But don't read the book first,"I read the book ""The Moon Spinners"" by Mary Stewart when Iwas younger and loved it, so I was more than pleasantly surprised when I found that a movie version of the story had been made. The movie is cute, but if you have read Mary Stewart's book, you will be disappointed in this ""Disney-fied"" version. A number of key elements of the story that make it good are changed for the movie and events that do not take place in the book at all are added in for no apparent reason. It's a cute movie, and I like Haley Mills, but it's not ""The Moon Spinners"". END"
1,I'm TOTALLY confused!,"Once again, Disney misses the mark with an inferior DVD release. Why do we crave seeing our favorite stars on DVD? Picture clarity, extra features, restored prints, optional commentary... none of which are evident on this poor release of a wonderful Hayley Mills film. Disney's inexplicable inconsistency becomes evident when poor efforts such as this one are compared to stellar, awe-inspired efforts such as ""The Parent Trap"" and ""Pollyanna"", multi-disk sets released with quality and features on par with Criterion Collection releases. I give up on buying Disney. Next time, I'm going to rent the DVD first. Why waste money on new Disney DVD's that are inferior in quality to the VHS versions I already have! Hey Disney, wake up!"
1,"Oh no, not again!","For the life of me, I'll never understand Disney. Buying DVD's from them is worse than gambling. One time I get a beautiful widescreen version of ""Pollyanna"", ""Swiss Family Robinson"", and ""The Parent Trap"" and the next time I get this piece of garbage with a disgusting transfer in the hated full screen format. This is not the first time I've been fooled by Disney, but rest assured it will be the last. I should have known better after being burned in the past when I ordered ""Castaway Cowboy"" and ""Blackbeard's Ghost"". Both of those two also came dressed like this version of Moon-Spinners. Disney, I have ordered my LAST DVD from you until you get your act together."
3,Times have changed!,"It was so funny to watch this movie as an adult! I remembered watching it as a young girl and I loved it so much. Now it seems kind of hokey but it was fun and funny, the scenery is still beautiful."
3,Disney's Moonspinners,"We bought the movie a) because I had just re-read the book & loved it, b) we loved Haley Mills ""back in the day"", and c) we had just returned from a trip that included Cyprus, Kotakolon and Rhodes. For an older film the quality & color was excellent. very fun movie to watch, especially to see the sights & sounds of (supposedly) Greece. The movie strayed far from the book but was still interesting & of course it is always great to see Haley!"
4,"Enjoyable, suspenseful film; Disney's answer to Hitchcock","I enjoyed this film very much. There was suspense and mystery at all the right moments and comedy in the characters of the aunt and Madame Habib, played by silent-screen star Pola Negri. Good performances from Eli Wallach, Hayley Mills, Peter McEnery and Negri, as well as the gorgeous scenery of Crete. The conclusion doesn't ahve any surprise twists, and is in fact very uneventful, but you can easily overlook that. This film was Disney's answer to Hitchcock, and though the master could surely have topped this film, it's still worth watching."
3,Hayley Mills fans,"Grew up on Disney and Hayley Mills, so this is a ""comfort"" trip back in time. First class actors including one from the silent era. The plot moves right along to the usual Disney implausible resolution."
5,EXCELLENT MOVIE,"I first read the novel ""Moon Spinners"" by Mary Stewart and enjoyed the book thoroughly. When I saw that there was a movie based on the novel I was a little skeptical, but Disney usually does a great job so I decided to give it a try. If you like Trixie Belden, Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys mysteries, you will definitely enjoy this movie. Hayley Mills is wonderful as usual and the movie contains great suspense and mystery with just a touch of romance. I liked it so much, that I purchased the movie so that I could watch whenever I wished."
3,Cute Hayley Mills movie,"A cute, disney movie with Hayley Mills. A little more grown up Hayley. My 13-year-old really enjoyed this as did I."
4,Still charming but feels slow,"I remembered being mesmerized by this movie as a child, so I rented it to watch with my children. It is still fun, but as compared with movies of today, the pacing is much slower. My boys stuck with it, but didn't enjoy it as much a those movies designed for those with short attention spans. Girls may find the romance angle (limited to a single brief kiss and a reference to the possibility of marriage somewhere in the future) more appealing."
2,Boring,I hoped to like this since I generally like Haley Mills but it was rather slow and boring. My 12 yr old daughter and I decided not to finish it.
2,What is Disney Thinking?,"I share the dismay of other reviewers about the unconscionable decision on Disney's part to release, in 2005, the wonderful Hayley Mills movies in fullscreen format instead of in their original aspect ratio, and in slapdash form in general. I have eagerly awaited the DVD release of this film, The Moonspinners and That Darn Cat, and am bitterly disappointed. What a waste! I encourage all fans of these films to visit http://disneyvideos.disney.go.com/ and complain to them directly, as I have."
4,Amazon HD Instant Video is the best way to view,"The Moon Spinners is a excellent who-done-it type mystery from Disney which has not been treated fairly by the company for years. It has been grouped with juvenile Nancy Drew type mysteries and not given a proper wide screen DVD release, but rather issued in a kiddie style cheap reissue. Amazon's HD Instant Video is a good transfer (not true wide screen) but panned and scanned for optimum viewing on modern 16 x 9 televisions. It has not been restored but appears as it did on movie screens in 1964, much better than the VHS master used on the DVD. This is well worth the HD rental price."
4,whoopi for full,"I rented the film at netflix which is why I am getting it. before the other part of the revue I only buy films when I can in FULL SCREEN? why should I pay for a film that makes half my TV screen Black at top and bottom is beyond me! I was so sad when films like WALL E did not offer full screen. I seldom bother to watch it now.This film shows that Haley Mills can play many parts and be top at it. It's been a few months, so all the details are hazy. I do recall I was happy watching the film. Bits of comedy, drama and mystery blended it well. Then then title slipped my mind and I did not re look till now.If you enjoy good family movies, it worth adding. Having it in Full is an added bonus."
3,The Moon-Spinners,"A fun Haley Mills movie, but not close to the story written by Mary Stewart. Still, worth watching."
4,Good family movie,I've loved Hayley Mills for years and I've enjoyed introducing her to my kids. Of course the book was ten times better but this is a Disney movie and certain things were'nt allowable at the time. Still we enjoy watching this over and over again. The heroine isn't a wimp either! That much carried over into the film.
3,Kind of a choppy musical production,This was kind of a choppy production - the songs didn't always seem to flow into the next - sometimes cut off early.
4,Awesome CD,"I am currently in this play and the cd goes exactly with the play. However, there is a few songs not on the cd in the play.The cast that did the CD did a magnificent job!!"
3,A mixed bag of good and mediocre...,"I am not sure exactly how I feel about this book. On the one hand, it's got some excellent photos, beautifully lit, lush with color. On the other hand it is not in any way an exhaustive reference of Fiesta, as one would expect with a collectible as popular as this. I like the fact that photos are shown of the various backstamps (marks), but I'm not wild about the lack of organization and skimpy table of contents. I'd like to see more examples added, categories more organized, and prices more accurate (mind you, prices in reference books these days are hard to pin down, due to the affect of online auctions on collectibles). Long on nice visuals, short on information (and a bit too expensive for what one gets!)"
2,Nice pictures of vintage...,"This book as some interesting info but not great. The book is 97% Fiestaware, most of that being the vintage pieces.Being a collector of the post 86 Fiestaware, the book didn't do much for me."
1,Too bad...,"... as in the book is way too bad for me to be able to believe the publishers had nothing better to do, and that's too bad. Best title EVER, but book itself is terrible, unless you're REALLY into the supernatural, country & western (generally), and/or Patsy Cline (specifically). I usually have a fairly short memory span for titles/authors/content because I read A LOT, but I read this book many years ago and yet the brilliance of the title combined with such disparate content has stuck with me. For some reason, it popped into my head today while I was looking for something entirely different and was inspired(?) to write this review.All that said, I actually finished reading it instead of throwing it across the room because it is somehow compelling in its awfullness (is that a word & is it spelled correctly?), like a traffic accident."
2,Fell apart!,This item is good looking but fell apart after a couple weeks of light use. The problem with the product is that there is only solid wood top and legs but where you screw the legs into is partical board. Thank heavens my husband is a carpenter and was able to fix this my replacing the partical board. I wouldn't recommend this product.
1,Was going give 4 stars but...,"Received this set and took everything out of the box and noticed the chair was broken in half. That was fine, we just sent it back and Amazon overnighted a replacement. Took everything out of the new box and was happy to see everything was ok. Got the 2 chairs put together so very easily, then started on the table. The screws split the wood on the second leg we tried to attach. There was no salvaging it. It was completely wrecked. So we are giving up on this set. I was going to give it a 4 star rating because it seemed so very nice and also easy to put together, but after having to ship it back twice, this only gets one star. So dissapointing. Will be buying a cheaper little tikes plastic set that we don't have to assemble I guess. You can't buy anything good these days."
2,"Not worth the cost, even on sale","Hello,I purchase this set during a Lightning Deal for $100, and after reading great reviews of the product on multiple websites. However, I regret buying it because it is not well made at all. When putting the table together, some of the Philip screws heads were stripped and I had to hammer screw bits into the heads in order to get enough contact to finish the job. The chairs were less troublesome, however, the back slats were loose in place because they were a couple of millimeters too short. Both the table and chairs wobble as well. My advise is to look for another set without any negative comments, regardless of the star rating.Regards,Ian"
1,Do NOT buy Lipper,"We bought a Lipper brand table 1.5 years ago and it has never been sturdy. Although the wood is of good quality, the construction is not. The holes were not drilled properly and the legs are all cock-eyed and constantly move around. We have one little girl and she is not rough with furniture. We are already looking for another table. I HIGHLY recommend buying another brand. I would put zero stars if that was an option."
5,solid - good quality,"solid, good quality, no sharp corners........it is a little heavy though. I weigh 240 lbs and the chairs have not problem holding me up"
5,Beautiful,This furniture was a Christmas present for our granddaughter. It is amazingly beautiful and well made. I highly recommend it. We also bought the toy box and the rocker. She has a complete set of beautiful wood furniture and it will last for years.
4,Review,Piece missing from the chair; had to make adjustments. Overall quality was very good; arrived as promised. Very sturdy and kid-proof
2,poorly made product,I purchased this table for my girls for christmas and the bolt has stripped on one of the legs
3,Difficult screws,"I was really pleased with the style, colour and finish of this set as it is good quality especially when you consider the cost. However I had real trouble with the assembling of the table due to the screws - holes are far to small for the screws supplied. As it is I dont feel it is very safe for my daughter."
3,Be prepared to buy some additional screws - strip easily,"The quality of the wooden table itself seems alright for the price, however be prepared to buy some additional screws. It is one thing to strip screws using a drill, but these stripped just using a screw driver. I had to buy a box of screws for the table portion as apparently the pre-drilled holes are too small and/or the metal on the screws is too soft. Had no problems with assembly of the chairs. Stain is definitely cherry per the description and not the walnut look shown on the picture."
4,Pretty good.,"I got this on a lightning deal for $99 bucks. I feel that is a fair price for this table. I previously had a lipper toddler table and chair set so I was familiar with this brand just wanted something bigger. My kids are 7 and 3, This table is a great size for them. They both have room to work on their sides without bothering each other. The chairs seem to be sturdy enough and the table is... pretty good but a little wobbly where the legs connect.. seems like it could have use more bracing somehow. I think it will be fine since my kids are older and won't be climbing on it too much like they did with the toddler table which was way more sturdy then this table. This is the link for that table in case anyone wants to know which one it was that I had.Lipper International 513GR Child's Table and 2-Chair Set, Green and WhiteOverall I am pleased with this table for the price, but I am glad I didnt pay any more for it."
2,cherry childrens table and chairs,"This set is very dark, reddish stain and I would consider it more like a mahogany than cherry. The finish on the top of the table was rough and irregularly applied.I returned it and kept the ""pecan"" finished table even though it is more like a natural cherry than Pecan colored."
5,Table and chairs,This table and chairs came with lots of pieces but easy to assemble. It is very sturdy and has come in handy for the occasional adult.
3,Fiery but not lava-hot,"This was published before under another name ""Fires of Eden"". I thought that Chase was too cruel. And although he realized his mistake early, he never really redeemed himself. Also, I thought that Nicole was just a wee bit wimpy to take the kind of treatment she received both from Chase and from her former husband and from these men who have been making passes at her."
2,Not worth re-publishing,I've enjoyed other books by Elizabeth Lowell but this one was decidedly below her usual quality. The characters were a little flat and she was not up to her usual research standards. While most of her information on volcanos rang true she made a lot of errors involving local Hawaiian culture and fact that I could recognize after living in Honolulu for only three years. Clearly she never had anyone from Hawaii read and critique the book. Skip this book and wait for a NEW book unless you are a die-hard Lowell fan.
3,Old Story reprinted,"This book is about the wounded betrayed soul of a woman. And a man who initally is about the worst of the worst. Very sexy, and compelling, but in this day and time slightly repelling as well. I read this book a long time ago. And it was pretty hot stuff. But the main charecter is such a pig for such a long time........oh well a lot of really hot books start off just like this one. Jennifer Sweet"
2,Tepid and embarrassingly dramatic,"When the descriptions of Mauna Loa and volcanic regions Kilauea breathes more sprite and fire than the romance, it becomes crystal clear that the classic love story is tepid and embarrassingly melodramatic with one-dimensional characters who are too brittle to hold against the majestic Hawaiian background of the story. Nicole Ballard haunted by the emotional scars and label as frigid by her ex, relives her humiliation when Chase Wilcox, a volcano expert and misoygnst thinks her brazen to break his brother's marriage attempts to seduce her and pour cold water. Nicole is too dishy and wimpish; and Ms. Lowell attempts to cover up the insubstantial plot. The emotional honesty and cool-headed heroines are sadly elusive in this lackadaisical romance that does injustice to the readers as well as the author."
3,REPRINT,"Be warned, this is a reprint of Lowell's Fires of Eden novel. The story is a good one, but don't buy it thinking it's a new one. I only gave 3 stars because it is a reprint, not as a reflection of the story quality."
1,Very Dated Book,"You can tell this is a book written a number of years ago. Ms. Lowell may have ""updated"" some parts, but it is definitely a book from it's time. The dialog was so over the top that I skipped whole sections. Ms. Lowell has the unpleasant habit of having the so-called hero have a pet name for the heroine. This could be cute if handled well, but it gets to be so annoying. I wanted to tell him - she has a name and it's not Butterfly. Stick to Ms. Lowell's more recent attempts. They are quite good."
2,Skip this one!,"Not one of Ms. Lowell's better efforts. I generously gave it 2 stars because it was slightly better than DESERT RAIN, which I generously gave 1 star). If you're like me, you'll find yourself scanning through the pages just to get to the end. Neither of the main characters are memorable or even believable. Some readers may like the descriptions of Hawaii's flora and volcanic history--but not me. It could not make up for the poor story line and weak characters. BEAUTIFUL DREAMER is a much, much better book. Try that one and give this one a bye."
1,disappointing,"I wish I had waited for the paperback. Really a poor example of Mrs. Maxwell's work. She is one of my favorite authors but this book is obviously one of her first efforts and not worth ""reworking"". Not much plot and a lot of sex."
3,Wow- this book is a treat for the senses.,"The opening chapter describes an exotic dance and the accompanying music in a way that brings the true artistry to life! Nicole was such a fine person - I especially loved the way she interacted with the children. Chase had been burned by a woman before, so it's understandable that he'd be wary and distrustful of any new woman, especially one who had created such a strong bond with his family, however his attitude toward her was unnecessarily hostile and judgmental. I found this a bit hard to bear. Still, the details of the various art forms in this book and the vividly described luscious setting made for very enjoyable and sensual reading!"
5,My first pagan book,"This was my very first book about witchcraft and when I read it I was both ecstatic and relieved to learn that there was a name to the beliefs I had and that I wasn't alone in my beliefs! I bought it solely out of curiosity--I was into astrology and other occult studies. Later I found out how barebones this book is, that witchcraft and paganism are so varied, but I am eternally grateful to the late author for having introduced this religion to me."
3,only for those who are not completely open minded,"This was my first book about witchcraft. I found it informative, but I wouldn't recommend the book to those who are completely open minded. I found the book a bit defensive at times. However, it would be a good book to give those who are skeptical about the religion."
4,It's a great book for beginners...,"This book covers a lot of what every beginner should know about Wicca and Witchcraft. It's a must have for every practitioner, and maybe a little gift for family members (if you just came out of the broom closet)..."
5,Very nice,"This book was the second I'd ever read on witchcraft, and Scott Cunningham did a wonderful job of explaining what witchcraft is, and what it is not. I've considered giving it to my parents to try to help explain to them what it is I believe. It's a good book for anyone interested in witchcraft who would like a summary of the basics."
3,Would have gotten more stars but...,"This book is basic. I mean really really basic. I guess it's good to keep around for family and friends who are curious about Wicca and Witchcraft, but not for the serious seeker who's looking for more...much more. The only reason it got as much as three stars is that it has an excellent reference list. The books that this book recommends sorta make this book worth it, although it should still be priced under a buck."
4,Informative,"Scott Cunningham is a great author that ,tells you what witchcraft is all about in this book . Very informative for the price . Great Buy"
3,an ok book,It was an ok book for people who want to learn about the craft. It was very detailed but confuesing if you don't read it more than once though.
4,The Truth About Witchcraft Today,I really enjoyed this book. I have always had a naturally curious nature and this book answered almost all of the questions I had. I have even lent this book out to others who are just curious. I would recommend this book to anyone who is curious about Wicca and does not know where to go to find the answers.
5,Great Book for Beginners!,"I have been interested in the craft for about 3 years and since then I've been using the internet to gather information because my parents didn't know. I told my mom and she was fine with it and I jsut recently told my dad and he still isn't too thrilled with it, so I'm always telling him things about the craft to persuede him it's not ""evil"". This book covers everything I've been trying to tell him and in the best way possible. It even told me knew things I didn't know. It clears up so many rumours and myths about witchcraft! I recommend you give it to someone who doesn't know anything or isn't too thrilled with it. It's my first witchcraft book and it is great!"
5,Skip the 1963 original - this revival is the real keeper!,"Two words will sum up this CD perfectly: utter charm. Usually I buy a Broadway cast recording for just a few select songs. But on this CD the whole is just as great as every single song. Every voice in the cast is top-notch and adds so much to the story. I bought this CD when I found out it was based on THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER. If you enjoyed that movie, or it's currect remake YOU'VE GOT MAIL, you will not be disappointed with this recording.If you ever have the opportunity to see this musical in performance, jump at it! I saw it at a local semi-professional theater, and it was wonderful. You don't need to see this one on Broadway, just see it anywhere you can find it!I'd also advise to stay away from the '63 original recording. The voices are over the top New York-ish, and did a good job of grating on my nerves."
5,Charming...Romantic...a perfect recording.,"What a cast! I had heard of SHE LOVES ME, but never had seen it, and loved this revival - I ended up seeing it six times! The cast is enchanting, with excellent voices throughout. This is one of the rare musicals where ALL the songs are gems - no need to skip tracks here - and the voices and personalities perfectly match the roles. Sally Mayes (Ilona) has never sounded better; Howard McGillin is a delight as Kodaly, and Johnathan Freeman a terrific Headwaiter. Boyd Gaines is a charming, boyish, delicious Georg, and if Diane Fratantoni can't quite make you forget about Barbara Cook, well, who can? This is a must for any theater fan, or any connoiseur of outstanding singing. If only this show was still running!"
4,"fine, but not a patch on the original cast album","This recording of the 1993 Broadway revival of SHE LOVES ME is a fine summation of the peerless Bock-Harnick score, though the original cast still remains definitive. Diane Fratatoni-Sutherland is a competant Amalia (Judy Kuhn was the original star though left by the time the cast album was recorded). Fratatoni, sounding eerily like original Amalia - Barbara Cook - is thrilling in her singing, especially the Act One heartbreaker ""Dear Friend"" and the manic ""Where's My Shoe?"". Boyd Gaines gives Georg an infectious joy, and Sally Mayes is just about the perfect Ilona. My only gripe about this recording is the putrid sound quality. Microphones are full of annoying reverb and extraonious noises, and detract from the full enjoyment of the performance. Nevertheless, a fine recording for admirers of this score."
4,Screamingly Funny Short Tales of (Not Entirely) Everyday Life,"In the seven short stories contained in this book, Jennifer Rowe places ordinary characters in seemingly everyday situations, and by adding mythical twists she creates wickedly funny fairy-tales for adults. Her style is dry and matter-of-fact, which is reminiscent of the deadpan comedian who has the audience rolling about with laughter.Being a storyteller myself, I also found Angela's Mandrake to be a helpful example of how to incorporate and convey humour in the telling of stories about everyday situations. This book is a short, easy, delightful, and extremely funny read. I recommend it to all adults who are still children at heart."
3,Its alright,"Its alright for most, but the smell didn't last very long on my skin. The smell wasn't bad though. However, it is a little cheap. I like more expensive colognes. I think this product depends on personal taste more than anything else. Good luck!"
1,Read customer reviews before you buy,"If you think you're gonna hook this guy to your network, map it and you're done... oooh boy what a dissapointment!This is merely a glorified USB hard disk (it looks good though). It's FAT32 preformatted, so any files larger than 4GB (such as my AVI and MPEG files) mean trouble. Add to that file naming and file sharing and much more...At such a price, do yourself and your wallet a favor and don't bother."
2,Think Twice before buying LaCie,"I purchased a LaCie NAS drive approximately 18 months ago. The product had several shortcomings including the inability to back-up files that did not meet its highly restrictive file name rules. This turned out to be nearly half of my files. The documentation with the product was terrible. Now, 18 months later, the drive ceases to function and LaCie refuses to repair it because:""Unfortunately, LaCie does not handle out-of-warranty repairs. It isusually not cost effective to repair electronics since the price for newdrives has come down and the capacity has increased"".I can understand a response like this on a $99 product but not a $600 NAS. My advice: Don't buy LaCie!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE.,"Please do not make the same mistake I did. Drive crashed after just six months and we LOST ALL OF THE DATA IN IT. Go with well-established brands like Seagate, Maxtor, or WD."
4,Bendable floral arrangement...,"A bit more flimsy than I expected. It consists of gold wire twisted into floral branches extending upward, with pearl and a few rhinestone details. I had to reshape it by bending a few of the individual wire branches so that the peice looked simi-simetrical. When they say that the pearls go all the way around the back of the headpeice, they do not mean that the floral detail continues. There is a single strand of tiny (much smaller pearls than on the front) pearls that continues around the back."
4,History book that reads like a novel,"Spence has done an incredible job of pulling together his massive research into an impressive novel. It provides great insight into the Chinese culture and inner-workings of the Qing government that I don't think I could have gotten out of any textbook, and the unusual story kept me turning the page."
4,Johnny Dodds MisInformed Review,"I found this book to be quite enlightening. Yes, it is her method, but it is obviously a successful one. There's certainly no fluff in this unlike some ""how-tos"" by other ""famous"" authors. The method described has been created and refined over her years as a successful author. Even if she's not a ""bestseller"", she must be accomplished enough to publish as many books as she has, and in hardcover no less! Johnny Dodd stating that 99% of what's published is crap is just opinion, and not a very educated one at that. Tell me this, Johnny, if 99% of what's published is crap, then how did it get published at all? If it's so obvious to you, why wouldn't it be obvious to everyone else? And editors? And reviewers/critics, etc.? Hmmm...I say, thanks Ms. George, for putting yet another unique spin on the process and perhaps taking some of the mystery out of a mystical profession."
3,Less than promised by the title,"I found the author's linkage between Einstein and options interesting, but was disappointed by much of the rest. The book does cover some counter-intuitive aspects of economic behavior, but the big puzzles like 'why do I invest at tops and sell at bottoms?' don't come up. Additionally, the book never links the various subject material into a unified perspective."
2,Of limited interest,"The puzzles in the book are of little practical value. If you have much previous reading in finance you would already be aware of these issues.You may also find the tone of the book annoying - ""look how clever I am"".Like most of finance, the math is not very interesting in itself, nor is it very accurate in describing the real world e.g. the Black-Scholes option pricing model.If you are reasonably good at math and know little or nothing about finance you may enjoy the book. Otherwise a standard text on investment management would be better."
2,Not very practicable in spite of the title,"This is not a very useful book, in my opinion. The puzzles can be interesting for some people, but I found it quite dull. Some people may find them clever and 'neat' but I don't think most people will be pleased by the book. Some of the puzzles are 'old hat' to anyone who has done much reading on finance eg option pricing."
2,Zipper Broke before school year was over,"Very pretty and nice, but zipper broke before the school year was over, so I wasn't able to use it for the entire school year. For the price I paid, I was hoping it would last at least a whole school year."
3,Nice Little Movie,"There's not much that I can say about this picture, It's mostly Dr. Otto, hence the name, and very little Ernest. The plot involves a device that zaps all credit cards, and sends the world into a mass panic.It's weird, fun, and because Jim Varney is so entertaining, you can't stop watching it. Pick this one up today."
4,Love this movie - missing beginning scene,"This is one of my most favorite movies of all time. I was very delighted to see they came out with a DVD version of it, but I was slightly disappointed when I saw that they cut out the opening scene where Ernest is describing the changing coffin to Vern at his garage."
4,Hits all the high points,"This book is pretty good! I gave it 4 stars because I'm writing this from my kindle and couldn't get the 5 star to light up...lol. Any who this book goes into the Christian life being secure and at the same time a struggle, which is what it is. :)"
3,The Strangest Way: Walking the Christian Path,The book was very good; however it was advertised as being new; but it obviously was not new. It had one dog-eared page and lots of underlining.
3,Book,I ordered this book thinking it was brand new. It came without a cover and it was highlighted in pen in several areas. Otherwise in good shape.
1,SAD SAD SAD,"THE LEMON LABLE GOT A HOLD OF THE GREAT ALBUM AND MADE A MESS OUT OF IT. THEY THE 'LEMON LABLE' RECORDED THIS OFF A LP AND THEY CALL IT A REMASTER.SAVE YOUR MONEY! IF YOU ARE A POCO FAN, WRITE LEMON AND COMPLAIN."
1,Poco Indian Summer,"This is a four or five star album, but I have only given one as Lemon Records cds are often mastered from vinyl. This is no exception and the Japanese edition is far better with no vinyl noise. Unfortunately, it is more expensive, but if you like this album, it is certainly worth it."
4,Compare and contrast,"I was always a Poco fan from the very beginning, but when I saw them open for Marshall Tucker Band in Shreveport La. I was completely blown away. I didn't even stay for Marshall Tucker.It was general admission and I stood at Rusty Young's feet the entire show.I saw the Eagles twice and other country rock bands but no one ever came close to the show I saw that night. Every member was on and the crowd was too. The performance was one of the best I have ever seen from any band, and I have seen most.I have the entire Poco collection on LP and am collecting on CD.Listen to the album Deliverin and it will sell you on the band."
2,The magic is gone,"The album shows the end of the magic. After recently seeing Poco in concert and hearing some of the early golden hits, I started at the beginning of their career and listened once again to all of the preceeding releases. Alas, when I reached this one, there was nothing. Indian Summer is a good (though overplayed in its time) song, but after that there is nothing on the release which makes you even want to here the song all the way through. Stick with the earlier releases where either the country rock ruled, or the harmonies were incredible. Here you get neither."
2,Poco Indian Summer,"Quality not as good as would be expected. Way past flat in the treble direction. However, great band ,great music!"
5,An excellent detailed view of an entire city,"Forge of Shadow is an incredibly detailed look at a whole city. Filled with gritty details of a conquered city, this book allows you to generate dozens if not hundreds of plot hooks and storylines. It is complete with descriptions of city districts, organizations, locations (`The Burning Elf' is my favorite) and personalities. In some ways it reminds me of the Freeport setting- dark and gritty, but under a unified oppressive yoke. While meant for the Midnight setting, I don't see why this can't be adapted to any other setting. If you want dark brooding city adventures, this is a must-have."
5,Excellent Buy Well Worth a Listen,Having had to import this album to Australia I was impressed with what I got.. in the US I understand that this was released as Deborah.Grab it now!!!
2,Not nearly as good as the first novel,"Prep was quite a good novel. The follow-up, The Man of My Dreams, is ... well, it's simply not nearly as good.The main character has real self-esteem issues. And while I might expect them in a young woman, the length of time it takes her to deal with them is excruciating. Even when people genuinely like her, she has a very hard time believing it. All that negativity is hard to take; a character needs to grow or there is no point in reading about them.She does finally get a backbone, but you have to read through a whole lot of nothing to get there. And I'm not quite sure the journey was worth it."
3,A bit of a bummer,"I so enjoyed Sittenfeld's writing in Prep, I couldn't wait to get my hands on her second novel. In a word? Disappointing. The story didn't flow in a compelling way -- I didn't feel like I couldn't put the book down, though it was a quick read due to the novel's length. Besides the main character, you really don't get to know the others on a level that gets you interested in them. Lots of characters to meet on a very cursory level. No doubt this will sell, riding on Prep's tail. I really like Sittenfeld's writing style, but this story didn't do anything for me."
4,Not yer typical novel,"We first meet Hannah Gavener as her parents' marriage is crumbling. Her parents' split affects her in a variety of ways, so it's only fitting that this is where the novel begins. We trace Hannah's life as a serious and somewhat aloof college student and into her adjustment as a young, working adult. We see her attempts at love and life, and though painful at times, we are made to read on and are compelled by the bittersweetness that is her existence and how frighteningly normal this is. The relationship with her sister, her cousin, and her friends are all chronicled in very real ways.Like Prep, Sittenfeld takes a slightly sardonic look at the coming of age experience and how growing up isn't always ""Laguna Beach"" and being prom queen. I enjoyed it."
3,"Honest, but character becomes tiresome.","The novel explores a woman's problem with relationships, both in making friends and finding a mate.I thought Sittenfeld did a good job with the friends problem. While an underlying problem is poor self esteem, Hannah is just ""off"" in her social skills, and not good at role playing. She is also more fixated on the perfect relationship than on having fun, presumably a consequence of growing up with parents who are in a dysfunctional relationship. A turning point is when Hannah walks away from a potentially fine relationship with a man, the problem being that she does not find him exciting enough. Thereafter, it is a question of why do good women run after the wrong men. I found Hannah increasingly tiresome. I will say that her character is consistent, even as she becomes more mature: the unconvincing ending aside, her entire focus is on achieving a romantic ideal.I did think that the writing is competent, honest, restrained."
2,Snooze,"I picked up The Man of My Dreams because, like other reviewers, I loved Prep. But I found myself quitting this one about halfway through. The plot is nearly identical to that of Prep, but Hannah doesn't have the same kind of depth as Lee Fiora does. Hannah's depressive mopiness got to me at times, and I found myself thinking, ""who cares?"" It was almost as though Sittenfeld had taken the characters of Prep, changed their names, and made them older. Sittenfeld vehemently denies that her writing is chick lit, but there's definitely a chick lit feel to her books--with, of course, the depressed teenager/ twentysomething.In all, this was a highly disappointing book because the author has so much talent as a writer, but very little creativity to create new characters outside of those that she knows. If you liked Prep, don't say I didn't warn you about The Man of My Dreams. It's just not up to what Sittenfeld put out the first time around."
3,Searching for the non-dippy equivalent of a soul-mate,"There's a limit, really, to how understanding you should be with people in whom you are seriously, romantically interested, but it's a lesson that Hannah never learns. Like Lee Fiora in _Prep,_ the author's first novel, Hannah doesn't change much between ages fourteen and twenty-eight, even as life changes around her. She suffers from low self-esteem, over-analyzes everything and everybody, and can be terribly, almost unbelievably naive. Her sister, her parents, her cousin, her college roommate, . . . all of them evolve as they grow up, but not Hannah. Or not much. This is not to say that I didn't enjoy the book, because I did. Sittenfeld is a close observer and talented painter of character portraits. But I hope she broadens her scope in her next effort."
3,"Realistic, funny and sad","I like how this books breaks down Hanna's life into three developmental phases and looks at her relationships with her Father, family and men. This book is similar in some ways to Prep, but it follows a different path. Hanna makes her life so complicated, with envy, jealousy and shame. She creates situations for herself that only make her feel more miserable and isolate her farther from people who really care about her. She is in awe of her cousin Fig, who lives for the moment, and is not afraid to take a risk. I was a little disappointed in some parts, but in the end Hanna learns to accept herself for who she is, seeing her strengths and she begins to create a life for herself that will help her find the man of her dreams."
4,Sittenfeld's genius,"is in taking you places -- from her past and your own -- where you're not entirely sure you want to go. But nonetheless, you go there with her, and somehow the act of having done so helps you to make sense of things, icluding your own life. I found parts of this book absolutely haunting, as I have with her other works. There are scenes which she has written which I find myself tucking away to ponder later, and which somehow I know I'll carry with me forever. The relationship which she describes between Hannah and her volatile, angry, unpredictable father -- and the way in which that relationship shapes Hannah -- is a scary, tough subject and one that I don't think any other authors have really approached in the same way. As always, I find myself wondering how much of her writing is autobiographical."
2,Disappointing,"I LOVED Prep and American Wife. This was just NOT as good. Boring, generic,...like a bad paperback romance novel from a grocery store."
3,First Time with this Author.,"I did not read Sittenfeld's previous novel, Prep, so I had no expectations when I started reading this book.I liked ""The Man of My Dreams"". Hannah Gavener is an interesting character. She is sent away to live with her aunt when she is fourteen years old because of her father's escalating fury and madness. She spends the rest of her life trying to understand if people ever really live happily ever after.She questions her sister Allison's relationship with Sam and wonders why she loves this guy. Her cousin Fig is the party girl who dates a different person from week to week. Hannah floats from relationship to relationship and usually ends up picking guys she knows she'll never really be happy with.Hannah is flawed but is still extremely likeable. The writing in this book is honest and extremely well done. I will read more books by this author."
3,Sophomore Jinx?,"I mostly enjoyed reading this novel and got through it quickly, but started liking it less almost the minute I finished it. The format was very ""Prep"" like, what with the skipping over from one time period to the next. However, whereas this device worked well in ""Prep,"" perhaps because time was gated by the beginning and ending of four years of school, here I found it abrupt and jarring. If anything it left too much to be filled in by the imagination. I almost had the sense the book (and writing) were rushed to capitalize on the success of ""Prep"" so that the author did not become another ""Donna Tartt."" The last chapter, in particular, seemed like a cheap way out and was overwrought IMO.Ms. Sittenfeld is an excellent writer and I hope that in her next outing she tackles a different theme (""Dreams"" was essentially a carbon copy of ""Prep"", thematically) and that she follows a more traditional, linear format just to see if she can pull it off."
3,For organ combo fans,"Turning Point is organist Dr. Lonnie Smith's second release on the Blue Note label (Think! being the first). This 1969 recording features a few noteworthy performances (Slow High, Eleanor Rigby, and Turning Point). The remaining tracks are largely forgettable.This recommended for fans of the organ combo in general and Dr. Lonnie Smith fans in particular.[DW]"
1,Not Pleased,"Very unhappy with purchase. Very poor quality. Wear 18 hour bras,snaps to close together to fit straps properly. More trouble to return than it is worth. Straps to long, for my taste. Do Not waste your money. Also cancer warning on box, This product known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects (FYI)."
2,A Group called Smith,I am very happy with the music. What I am not happy with is the way the cd is formatted Ican not down load it to my computor for my Ipod. Tried to call Dave at Hatboro music store but they closed their doors and he is selling stock from his home!
1,Group Smith CD not so good,"Bought one of these Italian remakes on an auction site for $30, shouldn't have paid more than $3 for it. It is not remastered and the quality of the audio is the worst I've ever heard on a CD. To sum it up, TERRIBLE. I've learned there is another version of this CD which IS digitally remastered and includes five bonus tracks. It's a bit hard to find but worth the hunt."
3,smith give it a listen,"Good Horn section. Baby its you is THE best cut. Shades of Genya Ravan. This group deserved better than the record company gave them. If you get a chance, give them a listen. I have it on Vinyl!"
4,Elegant biography !,"In this singular book dedicated by Liszt to his fellow friend , are combined the musical analysis with the biographic emotion . Liszt eviscerates with clairvoyance Chopin enigmatic personality , giving us smart clues which constituted the genius of the incomparable piano artist .It deserves special attention the chapter dedicated to the Polonesas in which Liszt makes a challenging statement comparing them with Verones paintings .Acquire this essential text to get close Chopin intimate universe."
3,Complete Idiot's Guide to Running a Bed and Breakfast,"Although this book has a lot of good advice, it's not my favorite book I've read on the subject. It seemed rather drawn out and some of the advice was rather vague. It's the fourth book I've read on the subject, since I am planning on opening a B&B soon. I still would recommend reading it, but read others as well."
5,The Complete Idiot's Guide To Running a Bed & Breakfast,"Mr. Park Davis really hits the nail on the head with this book.He has an amazing way of getting right to the point, with out feeling like you missed anything. He is realistic about the business and his experience shows that.I was having a hard time with expenses. The chapters on Business and Marketing cleared this up for me. Now I feel I completely have a handle on where my money is going! I knew it was going, just didn't know where.I would recommend this book to anyone involved with a B&B.; I personally am just starting, however, the book was recommended to me from a women in San Diego who has had a B&B; since 1982.Thanks for writing a book that is answering all my questions!!!"
2,Not Bad and Not Great!!!!,"Charm looks much better in the picture, of course I understand that it's much smaller in person. The quality is not that great, unlike the description. I've seen much better in the stores!! I will not return it because the shipping will cost me more than the charm is worth. Too bad for me, I've learned my lesson! Thanks anyway - my fault!"
3,Alva Vanderbilt : A chimp climbing up the social ladder,"Strong point: Good information, good biography of Consuelo and her boorish mother,Alva. Disappointment: I left the book unfinished,because before I was half way through, I was heartily sick of Alva's opulent spending and her social climbing society's ladder with all the elan of a chimp.Also tiresome was Consuelo and her simpering facial expression.The age may have been gilded, but the gilt on some of these scions was only gold plated!"
4,Gilded Age Mom and Daughter,"Consuelo and Alva had a dynamic relation, that is well known. This book details many of the now famous events in their lives, Consuelo's loveless marriage, Alva's divorce, their work as suffregettes and philanthropy balancing the facts and exploring some of the possible emotional elements. The author bases her work in fact, using source materials such as letters, newspaper articles and legal documents. It is a wonderful, accessible book to read about the life of two strong women."
4,An interesting read,"a great read, full of lot's of details and insights. I learned alot about these women, this class of society and the Gilded Age."
3,could have been better,I read this book but thought it could have been better. More true details could have made it worth reading
3,SAC Tanker Ops,Technical but failed to go into much detail of the effectiveness of the KC-135 in SEA.
4,Entertaining History,"Mr. Ronda has written an excellent history of John Jacob Astor's attempts to create a continental commercial empire. Beyond that, the dual stories of the Hunt overland party and the Tonquin adventures by sea makes compelling reading.It is the interweaving of the the three tales: commercial empire building, the overland exploration and adventures of Hunt (and the amazing tale of John Day), plus the seafaring adventures of the Tonquin. Each is great, but together, compelling history and reading!"
5,Incredible companion reference,"This book is an incredible resource for engineers and materials scientists working in the semiconductor field. Getting the most out of it requires a working knowledge of semiconductor physics and that's not a fault of course. The text is very well referenced and does a good job explaining the principle behind the techniques as well as the original references should you need more information. While it is a must-have for the lab, I ended adding it to my personal shelf as well."
1,Don't waist you money!,Don't waist your money on this video! It is very dumb! Not recommended. Really no point to the movie. The playback from Amazon was great though.
5,Gus is Great!,I can't recommend this movie enough! The Arizona Cardinals should dump Bill Grammatica & sign Gus!!!
2,Gus,"Walt Disney would turn over in his grave, had he seen this. But what do you expect, it is a movie about a mule kicking field goals. Besides a few amusing parts, Don Knotts is not up to par in this one. If your looking to occupy your kids time, this is not the movie."
3,Don Knotts and a Mule... you can't go wrong!,"Gus is a Yugoslavian mule with a real talent: He can kick soccer balls 100 yards with unerring accuracy. When Hank Cooper (Edward Asner), the financially flailing owner of a losing football team, gets wind of Gus's talent from a newspaper article, he envisions a halftime show that might draw crowds (and hence, make money). This also presents an opportunity for bigger and better things to Gus's shy young owner, Andy Petrovic (Gary Grimes). As soon as Gus's hooves touch U.S. soil he starts performing like a champ, kicking the ball at halftime shows with panache time and time again. Before long, thieves plot and carry out the kidnapping of the gifted mule, planning to hide him until after the big game in hopes his team will lose without him. This movie is flawed (mainly in its lack of production value) but it's well worth a look, especially for fans of mules and lover of silly Disney comedy.Staci Layne Wilson"
1,Waste of $,I quite playing this game when I realized I had run up against a glitch in the game that made it unwinnable. I also got sick of the random illogical puzzle. Save your money and just read the walk throughs. They are more fun than the actual game!
2,Avoid this one!,"I am a big adventure game fan - thought this one might be along the lines of Syberia - WRONG! This game had an interesting premise but was absolutely painful to play even when consulting a walkthrough every other minute. The character was hard to navigate, the puzzles completely non-intuitive (who would think to get rid of a t-rex, you had to mix a leaf, twine, paint, and blackened pear to make fireworks which then you had to launch out of a hollow log???) AHHHHHHH! Also because of the super rigid gameplay, you would be unable to do one thing without completing some other menial task, so you would be hunting like crazy for the one little thing you didn't do - and this is after following the walkthrough verbatim. Please play only in the event of a pandemic and you are trapped in your house for weeks and have no other means of entertainment."
1,TERRIBLE,"I usually don't play these type of adventure games, but it did sound interesting. However, I found out very early on in the game that you have to print out the manual to start the game moving forward. The cursor with the hand that is suppose to allow you to collect items, did not work all the time. I was unable to understand what I was suppose to do inside the caves since none of the items were working.Very disappointed in the game. I think that the maker of the game should try having people play this game before releasing it to the public, or at least test it and make sure that it works."
2,Some things don't make any sense,"I enjoyed this game at times, but it aggravated me to have to rely on the walkthtough for some of the puzzles. Those I had help on would have taken weeks to figure out and the final answer so obscure that it would simply have been trial and error, no logical outcome. Also some of the items you had to combine to do stuff did not seem logical either. If you already have a knife, why would you have to combine 2 or 3 other things to do what the knife could do? Dealing with the cursor was difficult also for the same reasons mentioned in the other reviews. I would recommend this game to someone who doesn't mind relying on walkthroughs and has infinite patience. The story was interesting but loses a lot when it's so hard to play it out yourself."
2,Cuban pop princess's greatest moments,"A beautifull girl like the sunshine , Martika scored a well-deserved top 5 hit back in the late 80's with "" Toy Soldier "" , an elegant pop song which hasn't lost any of it's charm with the pass of time . A best of though with selected tracks from her ( only ) two albums is available for the buyer more as a memory of a era now remembered with nostalgia than as an essential music proposition . Undersold cd-single "" Martika's Kitchen "" and especially the deep , ethereal love-song of "" Love..thy will be done "" also worth revisiting but still are not enough to support the release of sixteen-track collection ."
1,"No glass, just plastic film","This is a very poor product, and I will be immediately returning it. Instead of a glass (or even stiff plastic) insert, there is a paper-thin clear flexible piece of sheet plastic glued into place. It wasn't even glued in tightly stretched...there are many wrinkles in the sheet plastic.Note that the shipping weight of this is ~0.45 lbs, whereas the ""Grandma's and Grandpa's Ray of Sunshine"" one has a shipping weight of ~0.85 lbs. That one has either glass or stiff plastic (hard to tell which)."
1,awful service,the product was wrong. never got the right one. had to take action with amazon to even get my money back. was worst experience. & thats putting it nicely.
2,Disappointment!,"I received the bolero bracelet today and I was disappointed! Its much smaller than illustrated and the metal looks like silver! I can usually tell the difference between platinum, white gold and silver. This looks cheap."
3,Not an easy read,"I bought this to supplement our homeschooling science program because it is next to impossible to find a homeschooling science curriculum that will encompass human evolution and/or the earth's geological inception.This book has not been very helpful. The illustrations do not create a time map to show how human evolution progressed through time. In fact, the illustrations are not particularly helpful. The text is too wordy, and not the best at describing the evolutionary process to lower and mid-grade children.This book does, however, cover pretty thoroughly the migration and development of humans over the world. But still, I do not believe that it handles the information in a way that is inticing to children or even adults as it had me yawning--and this is the type of information that I usually devour!"
2,"Ok, but nothing great","First off, I can't even register it because the domain doesn't exist in the first place! second, i can't run the atlas because it says the sound devices were installed incorrectly, now who's fault is that? I didn't install it, it installed automatically! The articles are a little too brief too, and the encyclopedia has a hard time connecting to my cable modem to get on the internet. These are not things i would expect from a professional encyclopedia. If i could do it again i would pay the extra 10$ and get the encarta."
2,Just a little better than OK,"I got this as part of my kids' curriculum for this year. Whilst the articles about the different countries are good and informative, the link to update the information is obselete. The maps are quite good, but I cannot get a close-up version of any map, so when the kids are to find a particular island that is smaller than say, 200 miles wide, it will be invisible. Like I said in the title, it's a little better than OK."
1,non working software,"I tried installing this software. It installed. But when I tried to run the application, it gave an error message about sound installation and quit running. What an useless software."
1,Zenith C35A26 Keeps Shutting Itself Off!,"We've had this tv since May 2003. Intermittent problems began in August. The power stays on, but the screen goes blank and sound is gone. At times, the picture and sound will come back within 5-10 minutes.The bug is still intermittent, sometimes occurring 5-6 times a day, but it never fails when a repair technician is present.Any suggestions or information on known bugs affecting this model?"
5,Very Pleased,"My husband and I bought this for Christmas, and we are so glad that we did! It has so many menu options for picture quality as well as sound quality. We reviewed Consumer Reports, and they recomended the 32 inch Zenith, they did not review the 36 inch Zenith in this article. We decided that they are so similar except for the screen size, that we could not go wrong. We were right! This is a great TV for everyday TV viewing. Overall an A."
4,9 OUT 10 GREAT,THESE SHOES ARE GREAT FOR GIRLS TO WEAR WITH ANYTHING NICE STYLE AND STAY VERY CLEAN ON WET DAYS TOO THESE ARE ONE GREAT SHOES JUST MAKE SURE YOUR KIDS KNOW HOW TO TIE THERE OWN SHOES FIRST!!
3,not true to size!,"The sneaker is very attractive but they did not fit well, very tight and running smaller. It is probably the cut, but the New Balance sneakers I ordered the same day in the same size fit like a dream! I am trying to return, but there was no return label even though on this site the seller promises they send one with every order, and the order number does not show up on their website, and the phone number is a busy signal for 888 toll free. I also bought these for $40+ and when I came back today for a larger size they were much cheaper. In fact I just ordered the larger size for $15+! LOL. It is a very attractive and durable sneaker, however, and the kid did like them so I hope I will not have too many problems with returning the smaller ones, because I will come back and let y'all know!!"
2,Blade does not lock to base and does not slice thoroughly,"My biggest complaint (which is the main reason I returned it) is that you can't just pick the slicer up by the handle to move it. There is no locking mechanism, so when you go to grab the handle to pick it up (say to put it back in the cabinet), you only pick up the blade and not the bottom part. To move the contraption you have to pick it up from the bottom. The fact that the blade doesn't lock to the base is annoying, inconvienent and possibly dangerous.It also doesn't cut all the way through the bagel, english muffin, or whatever else you decide to put in there."
5,love this easy to use,I am always cutting my finger trying to cut bagels and english muffins so this works excellent and is easy to use don't have to worry about hurting myself. would recommend this to anyone.
4,Bagel Guillotine Slicer,"Works very well, but be sure bagels are not so fresh that the squeeze down to bottom of it without cutting the bagel."
2,Guillotine Slicer,Slicer does not cut all the way thru the bagel on the first try. Bagel must be rotated 1/4 turn and cut again
1,Not true to the Crusty series,I've been a big fan of the Crusty Demons of Dirt series since the beginning back in the mid-90s. This volume is just a documentary of their Australia efforts. It's a really weak effort and not recommeded. A waste of money in my opinion.
4,good stuff,"Album ReviewIn 1996 Sublime was the talk of the music world, until the lead singer died of a heroin overdose, but from the ashes that is sublime a new band has formed. That bands name L. B. Shortbus, which is short for Long Beach Shortbus. This band started by the members of sublime and Long Beach dub All-stars which combines the style sublime and gives it a new twist. This style of California rock infuse reggae, ska, and punk rock. There newest album Flying Ship of Fantasy does that and more. Between the chilled out beats of Beautiful to the adrenaline rush that is Walking Man. You are sure to find at least one song in this 18 song C.D. that you are bound to like. In all L. B. Shortbus provides you a great mix of different styles of music, just perfect for any party you are planning. If you're a fan of sublime, long beach dub all-stars, or just of fan of punk, reggae, or ska I would give this C.D. a look. It's about as close to sublime as you going to get.4 out of 5"
2,"No offense, but this sucks. Disappointing.","The funny thing was that I actually liked Long Beach Dub Allstars second album. It had some catchy tunes. This album just isn't that good. The lyrics suck. The beats suck. What the hell were they thinking? Just don't buy it. It is nothing like Sublime and nothing special. The singer they use has hardly any voice and there's no substance to the lyrics. There's no personal statement and I can see why it didn't develop a big following. Don't buy it. It's not worth it. Unless you like generic, mundane music with no real purpose. There's just no passion behind it."
5,"Not Sublime, but good none the less","If you're looking for Sublime, this ain't them; bUT an excellent CD. A lot of really good songs, some mellow, some flow harder. Certainly would recommend it to anyone."
2,All around weak,"Constantly looking for music that is white boy reggae influenced. This is such a disappointment, it's lame to even say I heard it. Long Beach Dub Allstars were lousy enough, though sometimes they came through with a catchy song. This has nothing but copycat Sublime beats, an awful voice, and kindergarden lyrics. Try State Radio (lead singer of Dispatch) for some substance."
3,Question answered,"This is in answer to gunsdhj's question. You are thinking about Blue Oyster Cult's ""Don't Fear The Reaper"". It plays at the start of the 'Stand'. Great band, great tune."
3,What this CD does not have.,"Actually, I was going to buy this soundtrack. I was excited thatI found it, until I saw the track listing. Where is Larry's hitsong from the movie and book, ""Baby, can you dig your man?""Also, there is a wonderful selection, I think by Foreigner, thatMolly Ringwald's chacter and the infamous Harold listen to whilethey are still in Maine. I was hoping against hope that the track listing would include the song and the artists. I wouldhave bought this CD in a flash, had it been so."
2,NEED BLUE OYSTER TO MAKE IT COMPLETE,"Without Blue oysters music,the sound track is lost and incomplete"
5,Not a review,"To those who complain about the Blue Oyster Cult and Crowded House songs missing from this album, there are multiple reasons why it may not have been included: a.) Varese couldn't get the song rights to include on the album, b.) maybe Varese/Snuffy/Garris felt that the songs wouldn't fit in with the rest of the score cues, or c.) a contract was struck to where Varese was only given orders to release the score. Either way, after listening to this album I felt that the songs would have been extremely out of place on the album given the mood the score itself evokes. The songs would disrupt that mood unless they were programmed to the very end of the disc.I don't advocate file sharing but we are in the age of Napster, Limewire, etc. so those two songs in high quality should not be an issue. Those are pretty popular songs after all."
4,A Nice Tool To Have,Has an enough to service all kinds of media cards. Wish it was a little smaller to get into my camera bag. A worthwhile investment.
4,Works well,"The previous reviewer apparently did not read the instruction manual. The Zoji does have a rapid mode that goes like gangbusters and then ramps down. But it also has other modes that stay on continuously for 36 hours. We are very happy with this machine, and would buy another."
4,Nice and quiet yet still filters air enough,"Very quiet on low setting yet it still blows lots of air. High setting is a tornado of air but quite loud. Low is where it's at though, so you can have the air continuously filtered all day and night. It's not only quiet at low setting but there's no whine or high freq sounds. As I'm really sensitive to noise, I hesitated purchasing this unit at first since I heard a lot of other air cleaners in this price range be noisy. However, it is indeed very quiet! Physically the unit is about the size of a 19"" LCD monitor so it takes up very little depth and could even be wall mounted if you desired! I put this unit in a room next to the cat liter box. Needless to say, the odor relief was welcomed and rapidly realized. Cat's not afraid of it being on since it's so quiet, doesn't bug her at all."
1,A waste of money,Dialogue is poorly written. Storyline is exaggerated making the characters hardly believable. Main character's constant search for pity is annoying.
5,GREAT BOOK,This is a really good book I loved all of the suspense I live in Joan Lowery Nixon's neighborhood
4,Spirit Seeker,"I want to recommend Spirit Seeker by Joan Lowry Nixon. I want to recommend this to teens from ages 13-15 who like myserty and murder. This book not only has great details-but it gives you pictures in your mind that you can see clearly as well as deatails that made you wonder, ""What's going to happen next?"" With it's great organization-there's not one detail that's mentioned that's not explained out and not one question that's not answered in the end. Spirit Seeker is a great book and there's a great chance you'll like it."
4,A Cliffhanger,The book Spirit Seeker is a great book about a teenaged girl and boy. The boys parents are killed and they don't know what happend. He runs away and to know what happens after he comes back you'll just have to find out.
5,A Magnificent Story,"Spirit Seeker keeps you on the edge of your seat, with powerful imagery, and wonderful story lines. I give it 5 stars"
5,Itz a GREAT book,This book is really good. I could not keep my eyes off it it is a real page turner. Whenever i had free time on my hands i'd pick up this book and read. I don't read much (I'm 12) but ever once and a while i find a really good book to read and this is a good book. so i recomend buying it itz GREAT.
1,Another work by an armchair anthropologist,"This book is basicaly a rehash of Walter Raleigh's work. Whitehead, never having done any long-term fieldwork in Amazonia, offers little new insight to his readers. He gets away with this by theorizing, as postmodernists often do, from a distance (and using the hard work of others). This book, as so much of his other work, is a sign of the decay of anthropology in USA."
2,"Get the ""Episode"" album instead","A friend told me Strato rules, I got ""Visions"" on impulse, I thought it was ok but I didn't understand if I was missing something or not. Then after a while I picked up ""Episode"", now that truly is an awesome album, this one is so/so, something I won't bother listening to much any more."
1,STRATOBOMB,"Well, this band is boring. Utterly boring. Copying. Screaming. No punch. Clean. Polished. Cheesy.Jens Johansson was not a great addition, it's enough to see some performances of him live with Yngwie Malmsteen. The guy is a session musician, he goes wherever he get paid more.The rest of the band is tasteless and without any real ""nager"" in their instruments, the should call this style ""CLEAN AND SAFE EUROPEAN POWER METAL"". There's no edge. No guts."
4,Fantastic band!,"I am a huge fan of Hammerfall, Edguy, Gamma Ray, classics like Maiden, Priest and now Stratovarious. I love metal music with great vocals and harmonious melodies. Stratovarious is a great ""happy"" metal band (think Helloween with keyboards).Visions is yet another fantastic album with 10 very solid tracks. Not a bad choice for new comers to sample, and anyone who is all ready a fan will not be disappointed."
3,I think I missed something........,"Being a progressive rock fan, I felt I needed to check out Stratovarius just from what I had read about them. After reading the other reviews I've come to the conclusion that I'm either getting old or missing something about this CD. Several of the songs seem to have very simple melodies that are totally overshadowed by 7 minutes of continuous double bass drum. I thought my head was going to explode at one point. On a positive note, the mellower songs were very pleasing to me. I think if you took away one bass pedal from the drummer, this band could put out alot better CD."
5,Appropriate for princesses aged 3-7 years! FUN!,"My daughters love this game! It's fun and they pretend with it, so there are extra laughs! It's too easy for kids over the age of 6 or 7, and I would say that it's a great beginner's game for ages 3. My 4 year old decorated her crown and has a BLAST playing this game! The play jewelry is easy to put on, and fun! A+"
3,"Cute game, not worth $15, crappy game board","We just bought this for our 3 year old.I do not at all understand why it is labled for 5 and over!!Cute game idea-But this was not well put together.First I about died when I saw the super cheap, barely cardboard gameboard!!!!!!! It is a VERY small board, set up like a 4 piece puzzle, that I predict will barely stay together after a few plays.the jewelery, subpar. the crown and rings are OK, the rest very cheap and plain. But is serves it purpose just fine :).I give this low marks for educational and durablity.BUT the jewlery box and spinner are a nice & durable!! If they put the same effort into the WHOLE game it may be worth buying.My daughter DID enjoy dressing up and playing a game together so that salvaged a star for the game."
2,Cinderella Accessories,"The toy was ok but not durable at all, when my daughter first opened it the articles were not firm enough to be worn by her."
4,Fun Game,"My daughter loves this game. It is not educational, but is usually better than watching TV.Advantages- The box takes up little space. I actually like how the board is 4 puzzle pieces for this reason, and do not find it flimsy.- The jewelry seems as durable as other play jewelry to me, but I have not bought Disney jewelry before.- The spinner/ jewelry box does seem very durable, and is such a great idea.- My daughter loves just playing with the jewelry for dressup.Disadvantages- Not very educational (little strategy is involved).- Many fathers would not be willing to play this game.- The game pieces are so much fun apart from the game, that they may become lost"
2,Not for every princess,"My daughter, a huge princess fan, got this when she turned 4. She loved the jewelry. Unfortunately, she didn't want to play the game. We tried it once and she was so bored, we couldn't finish it. In fact, the playing pieces got lost pretty quickly, but we do have the jewelry and she loves playing dress-up in them. The game is just not for every princess, but all the kids seem to like the jewelry."
4,Pretty Pretty Princess,My daughter got this for Christmas and loves it. The jewerly is very flimsy though. We still play it all the time but the jewerly breaks the first time used.
5,Great Beginners Game,"This is a great game to introduce board game playing to young children. My 4 year old niece LOVES it! It is true that it could be easy to lose some of the jewelery game pieces but that is why you just have to make sure and keep the separate from other play jewelery. And if you do lose a piece it's not too hard or expensive to find replacements. This teaches the basic concepts of board games: taking turns around the table; moving your game piece around the board; and fun competition all while your little princess gets to dress up with all the ""pretties"". Definitely worth the money!!"
4,Speech Therapy,"I bought this CD a number of years ago, never having heard of Judy Kuhn. What a beautiful, clear voice she has and her interpretations are valid. Nothing is over-sung and each track is convincing. I finally got to hear ""Everything's Coming Up Roses"" without the unpleasant Ethel Merman screech. Judy Kuhn does a great job with this old song. But, the marvel of this release is her lovely enunciation. It would be a pleasure just to hear her speak. With such vocal clarity and talent, I wish that she had recorded more of this type of music. For those who follow the singing careers of Broadway entertainers, I don't hesitate in recommending this CD."
3,Another Great Voice,"I just recently became aware of her singing and reported accomplishments. So, it was with anticipation that I bought this CD. A well-trained and strong voice, but, quite frankly, it's like the voice is a clone. There are hints of Betty, Barbara, Karen, and Patti, but no real distinction or interpretation of mood. Too bad."
3,Jule Styne numbers....,"I thought this album was great. However, I just wish she was a little more selective.......She left out many of Jule Styne`s great songs. I was hoping for You`ve Gotta Have A Gimmick and People. And perhaps more from Gypsy. And does`nt anyone think of Judy Garland when they hear Judy Kuhn? I do! I think they sound alike in many ways. Especially their approach to a song....they sound like they`re confiding in the listener."
5,ABOUT TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"It about time that the season 2 comes out! I love this show, best drama show of the 1990s by far. the story lines are real, like my favorite one of this season wes that the one where the grandpa never stays around. My sister's boyfreind is livin the same thing with his parents. It probably be about 2 more f***in years before the next one comes out."
5,"Full of heart, truth and drama","I've been waiting a long time for this show to be released on DVD. Party of Five is one of those rare TV-Shows, where you feel every second with the characters - without them being overdrawn or unrealistic. It is an honest show where everyone can relate.In season 2 the family experience again all the human emotions. From the joy of charlies wedding, to julias unwantet pregnancy, nearly loosing the restaurant, to finally finding a long lost family member.I can't wait for season 3 to be releases!"
5,When is season 3 coming out?,This is a must have for any Party of 5 fans. Can't wait for season 3 to come out.
1,Did not Receive,"I bought this DVD and it was paid for, but I still have not received this DVD and it was purchased May 20th. Very Poor service."
3,Disappointed,"2nd season is my favourite of this excellent show. I just wanted to warn the real fans that they may be very disappointed to see that the soundtrack has be changed. In several episodes that I love and that I almost know by heart for having recorded them on videotapes, the songs have been changed, and I tell you that it makes all the difference, as I think the soundtrack of this show has a very important part in the reasons why this show is so special and different from the other ones. So, yes buy it because if not Sony pictures will not product the other seasons on dvds, but like me protest against the change of the soundtrack, hoping that they will not do the same thing with the other seasons. This is the reason why I only give a 3 stars rate to these DVDs, instead of a 5 stars rate to this excellent show."
5,Can't Stop Watching...,"I begged for the 2nd season of Party of Five this Christmas after enjoying the 1st season on DVD. One of the best Christmas gifts I've gotten in a long time, I haven't been able to turn if off since I loaded the first disc into the DVD player.The storylines are great and the pain of the ill-fated relationship between Charlie and Kirsten is one that I can relate to. Don't let anyone make you feel cheesy for watching this show! It's definitely WAY better than the crap that's on Fox or any TV station these days. (i.e. ""Stacked"" with Pamela Anderson, etc.)Oh, please let Season 3 not be too far behind!!!"
4,Delighted with slight disappointment,"I'm so happy that the season 2 is finally released as it is my most favourite season for the show. It takes almost 10 years for me to recap some of the wonderful plots (mainly the story line between Bailey and Sarah) of the show. My only complaint is that its special features (just cast commentaries for 3 of the episodes and a half hour interview with Sarah) are a bit less when compared with those of season 1. Nevertheless, I believe every fans of the show will be more than delighted to receive the product.By the way, I'm a bit surprised that Jennifer Love Hewitt can do all the senseful talking in the special feature for half an hour withour boring the audience. She's really a gifted person."
4,A New Take On The Old,"Well, I have this cd, and it makes for great background music at a party or family gathering. It's all the old christmas favorites with a new take. You wont be sorry if you buy this one. But it is not the original artists, so if your looking for the originals, this isnt them."
4,Helping children with social interactions,As a Special Education teacher I found this book had relevant stories about social situations that children might encounter. After each story are questions that encourage children to analyse the situation just presented and to consider what they would have done in the same/similar situation.The book would be an excellent tool to help primary school children develop social/emotional and language skills.It would be very appropriate to use for children with Aspergers Syndrome.It would be even better if the illustrations were in colour eg.If they were more like the cover illustration.
3,Good questions but provide no answers,"The book provides thought provoking questions for kids but answers are not provided in the book. Although I know the right answers I don't the right way to explain it to my kid. Its very important for kids to understand what makes the correct answer ""correct"". The book is more useful for teachers, but its rather incomplete for parents like me."
3,Questions asked but no suggested answers.,Consists of chapters of different scenarios. My six year old likes to listen and answer the questions but most of the stories are for older readers. E.g. one story is about a young boy who goes into his brother's box under his bed (which he knows is off limits) and finds a stash of hash. This led us to discussions of not just respecting privacy/ to tell or not to tell but the whole concept of marijuana and what it is! I'm happy to develop an awareness but there are no warnings as to the content of the story. (Should have 'pre-read' but the picture caught my daughter's attention while flicking through.) The lack of suggestions as to what to do is made up for in the text which touches on these while reading. The concept of the story is often not apparent from the title or the related illustrations.
5,"""Roger Does It Again""","This recording along with ""Open the Door"" is essential for anyone who love Supertramp or just apreciates incredible and thought provoking music. Please do not delay in adding this gem to your collection."
4,Hated first listen,"While listening the first time, I thought this is awful, what happened. But remembering how much I liked Hai-Hai (half the songs are good/great) and In the Eye of the Storm (5 star first listen, every listen), I gave it another listen and it began to grow on me. After hearing it at least a half dozen times, I can now recommend it. I am still bothered by rhyming Mary and Cherry, and also the animal noises on 'Death and the Zoo' change a 5 star song to 2 star."
3,One one good track on the whole album.,"I think the other reviews may have been slightly over flattering to Mr Hodgson. The first track, ""Along came Mary"" is indeed a classic Supertramp song. The rest of the album unfortunately, is a collection of easy listening ""muzac"", totally unremarkable. I found some tracks quite boring. Had there been just two good tracks then I would have recommended this album but there aren't so I can't."
5,WONDERFULL!,"What a surprise for me! I'm old Supertramp and, of course, Roger Hodgson fan. I listen thousand times most beautiful Supertramp albums: ""Crisis? What Crisis?"", ""Breakfast In America"", ""Famous Last Words"" and Roger Hodgson's ""In The Eye Of The Storm"". But... OPEN THE DOOR IS THE ONE OF THE BEST PROGRESSIVE ROCK ALBUMS I'VE EVER HEARD. The music sounds like classical Supertramp songs, lyrics - is better than music! Simply buy this album, if you are real Supertramp fan!"
4,"Good but not like ""Eye of the Storm""","I love Supertramp, Roger Hodgson work. I've owned ""In the Eye of the Storm"" for many years and came accross ""Open the Door"". Without hesitation I searched to find it for my collection. The CD is growing on me but not nearly as good as ""In the Eye of the Storm"". I find it painful to listen to the last 1/3 of ""Death at a Zoo"". If you are a Supertramp/Roger Hodgson fan, add it to your collection only AFTER you own ""In the Eye of the Storm"""
4,A lot like the old Supertramp,"I was a big fan of Supertramp when I was in high school in the '70's. I've not been a big fan of either the post-split Supertramp or the solo Roger Hodgson. This CD brings back the feel of mid-70's Supertramp very nicely. The songs are very well-written and there's not a clunker among them. The opener ""Along Came Mary"" starts softly and builds. There are a few old-style epics - ""Death and a Zoo"" and ""Open the Door"" bring back the effects and sounds of songs like ""Babaji"" and ""Hide in Your Shell"". I have had this CD in the player for quite a while and it improves with repeated listening."
3,"One classic tune, the rest is agreeable enough","Hodgson is a songwriting treasure, with enough success behind him to assure his place in music history. But while this record boasts one absolute, must-have, instant classic (""Along Came Mary""), the rest is mostly passable. Roger has a tendency to go overboard with the treacly ballads, ""Say Goodbye"" being a case in point. He also tries to emulate the majesty of ""Even In The Quietest Moments"" and ""Fool's Overture"" without much success (the elephant calls in ""Death And A Zoo"" are really irritating). Download ""Mary"" and you've got the gist of it."
5,Open The Door,Probably the best album since Breakfeast in America(Supertramp). If You like 'Crisis What Crisis' or' Even in the quitest moments' you will love this.A brilliant album.
3,"It's OK, not great...","This mat worked pretty good for the first couple of months, but lost it's softness after a that. I Jazzercise atleast 5 times a week, so using this mat everyday on hard floors, started to become uncomfortable after a few months. I wouldn't suggest this to anyone wanting extra support on the knees. At best it would be good for the occasional ""at home"" workout with carpeted floors."
2,just okay!!,"This mat is good for the occasional exerciser... Not to suitable for yoga although I do put my yoga mat on top if i am ever on a very hard floor. The cover being washable is good but a pain to get back in right as the cover can shrink...yeah... so you have to work it back in and it takes some time to get the shape back. The padding itself being the foam stuff will over time become thinner as you use it and wear it down. It rolls up nice, not too big. Also when or if you sweat a lot it can get slippery, if you use your hands for support. You will need a towel to keep yourself dry and not let the mat absorb too much of your sweat. It would make a nice camping mat or mat for child in daycare, or for sitting in the park, wherever you may sit or lay down and need an extra cushion..."
5,"Elementary school Spanish teachers, ¡miren!","This fifth release from Los Solecitos includes a DVD with the adorable educational jingles you may have seen in between commercials on Spanish language TV stations. No need to compile a clumsy collection of bits on homemade VHS tapes - it's all right here! These peppy little song-and-dance routines remind children to use their seat belts, wash their hands, brush their teeth, exercise, and use safety equipment. Best of all, the messages are designed BY native speakers FOR native speakers, so this is ""realia"" you can be proud to share and interpret with the students who are learning Spanish in your FLES program."
1,Horrible,"I bought this becuase I wanted a hard drive where I could access my files via HTTP over the internet. Unfortunately, the HTTP server simply does not work. After waiting a week for a reply to an email sent to LaCie support, I broke down and called them by phone. After waiting on hold for 1/2 hour, the guy basically told me that the HTTP access is not a supported feature and may not work. He suggested that I could try downloading the new updated software, but that it was beta and might not work either. Ahhh!!!"
1,Basically it's red curry paste.,"I was hoping for a mix of flavors that would come close to duplicating what many Thai restaurants serve, but unfortunately as far as I can tell this product is little more than red curry paste in an envelope. For a small fraction of the cost you can buy a tub of red curry paste from a popular brand (e.g. Mae Ploy) and achieve the same (or better) results. But why would you? There's more to good thai fried rice than a bit of red curry paste."
3,Great poupadour!,"Fabian Forte. A pleasant guy, with a great poupadour and looks to match. But his voice... Well, the guy wasn't exactly a singer, but it didn't stop him to have a dozen of hits in the late 50's. This CD has only 10 tracks, but don't complain. It has the basic songs of Fabian's career such as ""Tiger"", ""Turn me Loose"" e ""I'm a Man"". These are the songs are fine. But, more than that, it's a real torture!"
2,"Go to "" This is Fabian""","I didn't own this cd, but I have UK product ""This is Fabian"" released by ACE. It has 26 tracks. If you want more Fabian songs, go for that one. If you don't have any Fabian cd, go for that one as all the 10 songs here are included there."
2,O.K.,This product is just that O.K. It functions. You need two hands though. If you try to open a bottle the top can come off and render it useless. Not what I expected. Don't get this if you like quality.
4,"A heart warming, beautiful story","The story of a woman at the turn of the century who leaves her husband and goes to a school to teach deaf children to speak. She falls in love with the children, and then with the doctor. No one knows of her past. This charming Disney movie was intended for TV, but was released to theaters."
4,Electric Bass Aus Bazaar,My son received the guitar for Christmas and it is perfect for him. He is a teen and just starting with lessons. So far we have had no problems at all with it.
3,Broken tone knob,"The tone knob is broken. It wiggles back and forth. Perhaps it was never screwed in on the underside. Too much trouble to send it back. Otherwise, the bass arrived in good condition.Electonics, strings and body are well made. All accessories were included."
1,junk,This bass was the biggest piece of crap two of the same strings came on it so they just threw the other one in the box tuning pegs didn't work cheap plastic had to order new ones one of the pick up didn't work had to glue it shipped in a very unsafe box would not buy again would not buy if I were you this is not even child worthy to learn on can get a used bass at guitar for cheaper that's better quality
2,You get what you pay for,"So, like everyone who purchases this bass, I just wanted a cheap one for fun.That being said, the first one that I got literally sliced my hand up. I only noticed when there was blood all over the strings. The frets were left untrimmed and sticking out of the bottom of the neck. As I played the bass, they sliced up my hands like razor blades.So, I contacted Austin Bazaar and they sent me a new one, which is fine.Like the other reviews say, this is a cheap bass, and certainly not professional, but it works.Just make sure to check your frets when you receive yours so you don't cut up your hands..."
5,Nice,"The one i got looked nothing like the one in the picture (it was black and blue sunburnt with white pickguard) and it said it was a huntington bass, but i like it beetter than the one in the picture. the only fault was the inlay on the 7th fret was missing, but that doesn't really matter."
4,great,the bass its self is pretty good but the white plastic that covers it was drilled wrong and made it hard to unplug cords from it and the bag it comes with is not very good
2,you can do better,"the guitar is not very good quality, the strap bolt on the top of the guitar broke after only a few months of use. the bag ripped at the seam as well. you would be better off buying used at a pawn shop"
5,boston review,"Fabulous art! why, why, why!is this book out of print! put this masterpiece back into print- everyone should be able to see this wonderful,rich work of art. The entire book in itself is a piece of art to own. I am going to research artist Timothy Basil Ering, he has an incredible sensitive touch. His textures, colors and drawings are exquisit. One thinks of Da Vinci or Michaelangelo when exploring this ancient feeling, hand crafted diary. Great story. Bravo!"
3,osteo,Product does seem to help my old girl a little bit. It is very overpriced!! I love my dog and I would pay any amount for even the tinyest bit of help. If the price were more reasonable maybe more people could afford it for their beloved pets.
5,Wonderful product,"We have used Osteo-3 Nutritional Supplement now for over a year and have had great results. Our family dog is a 15 year old black lab that is a retired police K-9. Due to many years (and his old age) of riding in the back of a patrol car, he has developed arthritis in his back legs. Before starting the Osteo-3, his range of motion was very limited. Within the first month of taking Osteo-3, he improved dramatically!. He has regained so much of his agility and spunk he had years ago! We are so thankful to have discovered Osteo-3!!"
2,A.K.A. 'Trauma',"This is another name for a movie called 'Trauma'; Directed by Albert Negrin, featuring Fabio Testi (not to be confused with the Dario Argento movie of the same name). Since it has been a while since I have seen this movie, I will give the teaser from a movie review guide: ' A private girls' school is located close to a village where murders are occuring and where rich men's fantasies are catered to by the populace.' I do not remember too much about the movie other that the plot dragged and when the person responsible for the attrocities was revealed, it seemed just like a random way to end the movie. My viewing of this movie was from a VHS copy. I do not know the quality of the DVD, but, considering that it is from Saturn, I do not have high hopes.-Bob"
4,jammin juice from the grapes,"i was there for this show. i started seeing this band in 1987. this album represents thier tightest lineup ever. from the ""bob fortin"" introduction to the last notes of ""pick the lock"", this is a must have for any true rock &roll fan."
3,"Don't forget the ""second feature""!","It seems like many of the reviewers of this release have concentrated on ""Chosen Survivors"" in their comments. I'd just like to put in a plug for ""The Earth Dies Screaming"" as the movie here that I liked better. (Admittedly, an awful title if one wanted the film to be taken seriously).A movie directed by Terence Fisher cannot fail to be of interest to genre fans. Dumb title aside, the plot is reminiscent of The Day of the Triffids; I actually find this film as good if not better than the 60's version of that. All in all, a sort of Triffids meets Village of the Damned meets Target Earth. And I can't say enough for the demo-quality black & white transfer. I know I'll be returning to this film often, something I can't say about ""Chosen Survivors"".If you like 50's-60's sci-fi, do treat yourself to this set! (Four stars for ""Earth"", two for ""Survivors"" is what is behind my overall three-star rating.)"
3,Chosen Survivors - Saw it !,"I saw this movie back in '74 when I was a kid. I remember all the bats and the plot pretty well. They were sent to this bomb shelter to survive a nuclear war, and the shelter was cheap, and the bats got in. The death scenes were cheesy, but effective for the time. I know the ending of the film, but wont disclose it for those who haven't seen it yet. It's complete with babes, and heros, and wild characters. It's definitely a good B-movie night flick!"
4,Classic Brit Sci-Fi,"Now, this isn't 21st century CG effects or sexy story lines but it is entertaining and worth a look-see to fans of the genre.Much more akin to the early ""Dr. Who"" series as far as story and effects are concerned.If you're a fan of ""Village of the Damned,"" ""Quatermass and the Pit"", ""X-the Unknown"" or ""The Day the Earth Caught Fire"" among other British Sci-Fi of the 1960s then this charming ( and admittedly somewhat naive) film fits the bill."
3,Old style sci-fi,"Old style sci-fi with the strong, take-charge leading man, and beautiful, intelligent but submissive leading lady. Set in UK, with odd looking robo-badguys that don't instill any real fear. Characters fairly well realized. OK, but not great."
4,FLORIDA BOY DOES GOOD,"This is an impressive compilation of Johnny Tillotson's hits. I would have liked to have had ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" on here. It was the flip side of another Hank Williams, Sr. song ""I Can't Help It"" that Johnny did in the fall of 1962. And ""You Can Never Stop Me Loving You"", a great teenage angst song from 1963, would have worked better with its otherwise great acoustics if it had been available in stereo; otherwise, this is a pretty complete account of his hits. ""Earth Angel""? Not a hit for Johnny; I'll stick with the Penguins on that one."
5,holman bible,This is my next bible to read through. I have looked at others and this one is fantastic. It is dead on. Keep up the good work.
2,You can't have seriously liked this.,"The journalist who wrote this book infused her own feelings and opinions into every word. Bollywood Boy is not an objective work, nor is the writer's voice interesting or accurate enough to allow her bias go unnoticed. She fell in love with her main character and selfishly and rather dully used everyone she came in contact with - including us, the readers - to get where she wanted to be. It would have been great if this book were really about Hrithik Roshan, or the Hindi film industry, or the Indian people. It was just about Justine's crush. The publisher obviously doesn't know the subject matter well enough to know that there is little substance here, but did he have to, to at least recognize bad, self-indulgent writing? The arena remains clear for someone else to actually write about Roshan."
1,Get what you pay for,Always wondered how the pump worked. In these shoes its all or none. Unfortunately the all is way too tight for me. Not a very comfy shoe.
5,a great book on MANAGING developers,"Most books on development focus on techniques of developing products but few focus on organizing, motivating, planning around the teams who do the work. (one such book is Joel Spolsky's 'Smart and gets things done.') This book isn't about building better products--altho it will help do this; it's really about helping OTHERS develop better products.Which is better? Cubicles or team pods? How does a manager provide oversight in agile without micromanaging. Should QA be on the team or external to it? Ken has the answers.If you're looking for a book on how to be a dev lead of a small team, this is a good start but perhaps there are others. But if you need to know how to be a leader of MANY dev teams, this is the book you need."
2,Developer's eye view of Managing Software Maniacs,After reading this book there was only one thing I took away with me. Ken Whitaker's ideal priority list for making decisions. His discussion on the why is most illuminating.The rest of the book is somewhat wooly. I felt that for my needs (looking to move to technical lead) Rapid Development was a more worthwhile read.
5,The Best!,"This book is the best book of Celtic history and ritual that I have ever read. Alexei's scholarship is incredible, and while most such books are dull, he presents the information in a very interesting way. He does not handfeed you pre-written ritual, but gives you the framework for you to customize and research. This book is for Pagans as well as open minded Christians, which makes the book countlessly usefull. I heartily recommend this book to anyone who is interested in true Celtic heritage."
3,no head phone requared,"i love the idea that i can listen to it while drivingother cd's must wear head phone ,"
5,I have loved both the movie and songs for years.,I love the song Flying Dreams. It give me a lump in my throat everytime I hear it. I plan to give the lyrics to the song to my valentine. I hope he likes it a much as I do. Every word can be related to us. I will remember to tell him who wrote it.I remember seeing the movie as a child in elemetary school. It was a big hit then and I am sure it is now.Thank you Mr. Ball. I love your work.Marcus Ray Dillon
5,Dining Chairs,"These are awesome chairs-solid, sturdy and easy to assemble. I'm so pleased with the affordable price."
1,I have the facts and I'm voting NO!!!,"I've hated a lot of the Deathcab for Cutie C.D.'s I've heard, but none of them so much as this one. This album can be criticized mainly for its recurrent melody styles, vocal rhythms that just don't work, and the fact that most of the songs are dull and mellow. Although this band has exceedingly well written lyrics, it is difficult to pay too much attention to them since the rhythms accompanying them are so uninteresting. The only song I was able to tolerate, let alone like was ""Title Track"". This tune has a cool drum beat, a catchy rhythm, and the typical good set of lyrics. While Deathcab for Cutie fans would probably eat this album up, I simply can't stand it. Also, there are only ten songs on it, a rather unsatisfactory amount of tracks in my view. I would give this album one star, though it is somewhat useful in curing insomnia."
2,I am a bit dissapointed.,"ERm, I'm not under thirteen I just don't feel like creating an acount, seemed deep. Anyways, when I turned it on, i heard some slow stuff. So I thought maybe it was a slump, so I turned it to the next, then the next, all slow! I'm the type of person who like the 'lets revolt against authotiry and scream about how pissed we are' type person. I mean, this stuff is good if you like quiet. Good lyrics, /really/ good, but also quite slow. I want my money back though.... =/"
2,Better than what? I guess some jiggy rapper,Built to Spill with a keyboard before they started doing the same thing. Umm...pretty alright for snoozing but hell the band was young and impressionable.
5,These Guys Rock.,"I've never heard such a good band, especially from the Seattle Area, that has mostly all soft music. This stuff is great for every mood and time of day. They simply kick butt."
1,toothless old man,"this record is like a toothless, senile old man: it's kinda cute at first, but the more you listen to its meanderings, the more you want it to shut up and go away. the songs have absolutely no drive, or teeth, and they sound like they were recorded in an underwater hallway. how they could be compared to built to spill or modest mouse is beyond comprehension. those bands rock. this one just sort of stumbles around in the dark, forgetting to turn on its instruments."
3,We have the facts and we're voting . . . maybe.,This album became a little monotonous after a few listenings. Tracks no. 3 & 8 are very good however.
4,Strong. But vinyl grooves would still be intact.,"While the album is strong throughout and sonically interesting, it won't raise your heart rate. Comparisons to Modest Mouse or other Seattle bands are a bit of a stretch. Manchester maybe. If I catch them live it might cast a different shadow on the tone of this album. Worth buying. But not groundbreaking (yet)."
5,Perfect Condition,"The disc was in perfect condition. The case was cracked but who cares about the case? As long as the cd plays with no skips, i am happy. I have had many good experiences purchasing used CDs from gdwil. Huge Death Cab fan... not a big fan of this album for some reason. Maybe I need to listen to it a few more times.."
3,Earns a vote,"3 1/2Although they would go on to accomplish more, this early work has an agreeably airy humbleness that serves the band's emotive engagements well; a return to this production aesthetic could reinvigorate."
5,I love this album,"Alright, granted this doesn't have the flare/character that Plans has, but it is right up there with it in it's own way. This cd has a ton of emotion in it. Though it's slower music...it is very engaging and I actually prefer it over Plans if I'm in a relaxed/tired mood. If you think CDs like Postal Service/Plans are awesome but have a few too many random sounds in them, this CD will also rank high on your list as it is a very lyrical and musical cd (less artifical sounds). All in all...it gets an enthusiastic thumbs up."
4,"Melodic and Soothing, but a tad repeatitive.","I got this CD as a present from a friend in Seattle who raved about Death Cab being the next big thing. She was sort of right, they have gotten extremely popular since then. This CD starts off very strong, but after Company Calls epilogue, it gets somewhat repetitive. Not that that matters much, because they are all talented musicians and the quality is superb. Good if you like bands like Perdo the Lion or Modest Mouse."
3,worthwhile,"DCFC is a solid band. while some tracks on this album take on a depressing, mellow sounds, they definitely grow on you. give them a chance. you'll like that you hear."
5,Los bandidos de Rio Frio,"I saw this movie as a serial in my country Cuba, before the movie I read the book, this is one of best novels about Mexico , its costumes, traditions and supertitions century 19th befor the war between Mexico and France. I strongly suggest to red and see the movie."
3,Good for costume use,Bought these to complete a halloween costume this year. They worked good for me. They are a little tight but wearable. One of the metal studs popped off. All in all an ok product.
1,The film has nothing to do with Jackie chan!!,"This video is not worth buying as Jackie Chan is not in it! He is in the music video at the end and there is a small interview with him, thats all folks...... This video is a waste of time and money!!"
1,Where's Jackie Chan?,"Don't be decieved by the title of this movie. Although it features a fairly lame interview with Jackie Chan at the beginning, the movie itself does not appear to feature him except in the title. I found it to be a terrible waste of time to watch this. If you want a Jackie movie, don't watch this. If you want a good martial arts movie, don't watch this. If you want a good paperweight, I think that it is possible to find a better one."
1,"SUCK,SUCK AND SUCK SOME MORE",This movie suck so bad i wish I had rent it before I bought it. OK first of all they put jackie on the front of the box knowing he is not in the movie that made me so mad. Second the movie had less fighting than any martial art movie i have ever seen about two fighting scene to be exact.WARNING: DO NOT PURCHASE ARE RENT THIS VIDEO IT SUCK IT'S THE WORST MARTAIL ART MOVIE.
1,"Warning this is not a Jackie Chan movie,","The original title of this movie was Project S, made in the early nineties and starring Michelle Yeoh. Jackie Chan only has a small cameo as a drag queen ! Its clear that Jackie Chan fans are being exploited by video distributors and I for one find this kind of abuse offensive. If you would like any advice on other Jackie Chan movies then e-mail me at peterharrop@freenet.co.uk"
4,Keep the spear burning...,"This album is awesome. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because Burning Spear has other albums that are better than this and they are 5 star albums (in my opinion). I will start off by saying if you don't have the albums Marcus Garvey, Man In The Hills, Dry & Heavy, Social Living, and Hail H.I.M. get those first. Those are classic, raw Burning Spear in his true form. If you have all of those and want more Burning Spear, get this.This album won the 1999 Grammy for Best Reggae Album. It is a more polished, refined sound than the albums I mentioned previously. However, it is not a mainstream album. Its still roots reggae with bright horns, thick bass, and funky drums. I happen to like the more raw sound of his 70's releases a little more, but this is still great Burning Spear. The best songs are Brighten My Vision and House Of Reggae. If you're a true Burning Spear fan, you won't be disappointed with this album."
5,Sublime Spear,Burning Spear is reggaes living icon (8 grammy nominations). Staying true with Calling Rastafari he shows all listeners why he has been making true roots reggae for several decades. Spear stays on top of his game by spinning out another gem of a recording.
2,Gnosticism without knowledge for me,"This book is for professionals!! I was hoping for a better understanding of the influence of gnosticism on modern thought, especially New Age thinking. Instead this is an introductory volume for a large number of highly detailed, thoroughly researched future books. In the intro. the author spends most of his time justifying the authors he will site in future volumes. There is little explanation of the intellectual roots of gnosticism or how it plays out in the current stream of culture. I have tried to stay with the reading but it has not been fun or truly enlightening. Read this if you are going to teach a Ph.D. course."
4,"V Empire, not Vempire!","Oh, the sell-out band Cradle of Filth; Proud owners of the worst vocalist ever, Dani. Despite their ""ranking"" in the Black Metal scene (although they really are not BM anymore) this album is actually worth buying. The music is very well produced (BLAH!) and organized. All the songs are connecting to each other, making it almost one song. The vocals on this album are actually placed in the right spots, instead of cat rap like vocals! Early COF is not that bad, but after ""Cruelty and the beast"", they fell into the light of stardoom. This may be the only COF album I actually enjoy."
5,It worked...,"It's impossible to tell if things like this work because if you don't get sick, you don't know if the water was infected or not. Nonetheless, on my last backpacking trip I planned on getting water from a stream that I saw on a map.The stream ended up being extremely low, almost dry actually. The water was brown, almost completely still and very sketchy looking... I was pretty reluctant to drink it but I didn't have any other source of water for the trip.I filled a 40oz container and added the pill. Waited 4 hours and drank the whole thing. Then got more water for the rest of the trip. I didn't get sick so it must have worked!"
3,Drinkable water that smells like the pool.,"It works well but the treated water will smell bleach-y. Taste and smell managaeble and not too bad to drink. Also, preferable to dysentery or buying several bottles of water a day."
2,devil in the details,No one has mentioned that one must treat the water for four hours to get the sterility touted. That's a long time to wait for a drink!
5,"I know it is cliche, but . . .","this could be my favorite CD that I own. Every band contributes a new sound to the album. Especially good are Collapsis's ""October"" and Sister Hazel's ""One Nation."""
5,Sammi-Lady with the everything voice,"I have enjoyed this Lady's voice for many years and only wish she would put all her albums on CD. I have two CDs ""the Best of"" and another""Here comes that Rainbow again""-If any one knows of any other CDs, please add to the list here. Her voice is so much ahead of the young millionaires today, its a shame she can not share it with us once more."
5,Best of Sammi Smith,"The entire CD was excellent.To my ear, the best song on this disc is ""My Window Faces the South"", musicians on that track were: Wade Ray, Billy Cash & Hall Rugg on steel guitar.Vibrant, jazzy, outlaw country!"
3,"CD sammi smith, best of",i can't really rate this CD because it was a gift for someone else and i don't know anything about sammi
3,Nice pics but not much variety,"We are remodeling our master bath and bought a number of bathroom idea books. This one has nice pics but is probably the least useful, with few new ideas. Browsing through the book for tile ideas I see that most of them are the standard country checkerboard pattern. It would have been nice to see something new."
2,not what I liked,This book didn't have any ideas I could really use because the bathrooms were very large and not what a normal average home would have. This book is over rated and I don't recommend it.
4,"Great sax technique, combining old school r&b with modality.","Frank Catalano combines Coltrane- like modal techniques with old school, bar-walking r&b; bravado. Mr. Catalano plays a fiery sax, with plenty of post-bop technique, but reaches emotional heights with one- and two- note repetitive phrases ala the r&b; sax players of the late '40s and early '50s. His group is right with him, especially the drummer, who picks up on the fun and keeps it all loose and swinging.All in all, a great recording, way ahead of the present 'contemporary jazz'artists."
2,Not up to TI standards.,"It is just a over priced CD, with some commentary to accompany some pretty pictures. From past experiences with TI books I was expecting some quality instruction for my money. I was very disappointed and feel I was ripped off."
5,Comforting and Reassuring,"I read the first printing of this book after my divorce in 2000. I loaned it to a friend and never saw it again. I just found out about the second printing and I'm thrilled!!In all these years I've held Mr. Nichols' words close to my heart. Especially his observations regarding friendship with one's former spouse. He writes that our society pressures divorced couples to maintain a friendship. That pressure is often cruel. ""It is unreasonable to expect couples to do in divorce what they could not do in marriage."" (Something like that, it has been a long time.)This book addresses the soulful and spiritual crises surrounding divorce that I have not found anywhere else."
5,"Tricky interface at first, will not work with iPhone or Touch",This unit works well with my iPod. I wish the interface would know where in your playlist you are so you don't have to scroll from the beginning of your playlist every time you want to play something new.It will not work with podcasts but you can just create a podcast playlist where you can just drag and drop the podcasts. You do lose the ability to skip tracks that is usually available with the podcasts.It will not sync up or charge iPhones or iPod Touch units but it's not an issue for me.I have been supremely satisfied with the ability to put my ipod in the glove compartment and control it through my head unit's remote with perfect sound quality (iTrip has always been an nuisance and static was always an issue).
4,works great,"easy installation , not rocket science and works great , would be perfect if you be able to see your podcast/videos/movies from your ipod but up to now works great with the music"
1,Do not purchase if you have an IPOD Touch,I bought this for use with my Ipod Touch and it doesn't recognize the ipod at all - it is useless for me......
3,You must control the IPod thru the stereo with this,"I bought the adapter to go with the JVC car stereo with HD radio. I felt the IPod adapter would be superior to the generic adapter because you can charge your IPod while you drive. The thing I didn't count on is that you give up all ability to control the IPod, except through the stereo unit.Now, everyone knows that Apple is renowned for its user interface. Well, forget about using the click wheel, looking at lists of songs, etc. You are forced to navigate through the contents of your IPod using a one-line monochromatic display. Frankly, this sucks. There should be an option as to where you can control your IPod. I am returning the IPod adapter and going with the generic headphone jack.Don't make the same mistake I did."
3,"Good product, limited functionality.","This adapter was just what I was looking for. I have had my JVC car stereo for a couple years, but I wanted a more convenient method of storing and playing my music, so I got an iPod and this adaptor. It was easy to install and I did not find it difficult to learn to navigate the menus on the JVC front panel. I did have one major disappointment which is the reason for the 3 star rating. Although the product manual states that the iPod will charge whenever the stereo is on, when I plugged in my gen4 Nano, the screen on the iPod displayed a message that this adaptor did not support charging. So my listening time in the car is limited to the internal battery life of the iPod."
2,"Connects the iPod to my car stereo, lacks usability","The reason i bought this product was because i was hoping to make driving safer. It's good to have the controls for the iPod on the stereo instead of looking for the iPod and then looking for a particular song.This product just made my driving more dangerous. The menu system on this is slow, it does not remember where you are browsing so everytime you have to start browsing right from the beginning, and this would be single biggest issue with this product. If it just remembered where i am in the menu.Don't get this if you think it will make your life easier while driving."
2,Doesn't work properly with IPod Video and JVC KD-HDR1,I bought this device expecting full controlling my IPod Video via JVC KD-HDR1 head unit but after installation got only charging and sound transfer from IPod to head unit. VERY disappointed but at list I can listen music.
2,Waste of time,"For the JVC receiver I got it is a waste of time and money. My receiver already got an USB conector and it is much easier to operate the Ipod using the USB conection than using this adaptor. I expected that the operations should more similar to operating the Ipod itseft, but it is a big mess. I finaly gave up and now I only hook up my Ipod inthe USB connector of the receiver."
3,Not for use with multiple interfaces,"I purchased a JVC radio and this interface as well as an XM Radio tuner interface. You cannot connect both interfaces to the radio simultaneously to allow a choice between XM / iPod. There appears to be an available input to allow that, but it will not let the cable plug in (interference within the plug prevents it).If you only want iPod connectivity, this will probably work for you. However, the 3-star rating I assigned is due to the lack of product information both inside the box and in the listing DO NOT state you can have XM OR iPod and you only find this out after purchasing them both. Also, JVC does not state if you can connect more than one of these interfaces through their radio.I am sure someone makes another device you can purchase after buying the radio, XM tuner interface, iPod interface to drive the cost of changing your radio even higher yet....Just for iPod, you should be fine."
