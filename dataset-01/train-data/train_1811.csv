4,A pleasant fairy tale,Readers of Ms. Shinn's other books will not be surprised by this one. The story moves smoothly and the characters are well defined. Shinn's style of writing is well suited to the medieval setting. She seems more comfortable in this environment than she did in the sci-fi settings of her last two books. If you're looking for a fun read look no further; if you want food for thought keep looking.
2,Boring,"Sweet story - but boring. I could finish it, and there was one good unexpected twist - besides that, you figure out the story fairly quickly. Also pretty shallow - same old same old themes."
4,A Light Fairy Tale Read,"I was in the mood for a fairytale, so I was pleased to get Summers at Castle Auburn. I would consider it YA fantasy, as there is some magic and fey-like creatures, but that is hardly the core of the story. It's a coming of age story, starting with the infatuation of a young girl, and ending with a young woman clearly making choices for herself. There isn't a race to the finish, the pacing is a bit slower, but the story still flowed well and kept my attention throughout. The main character was believable, and progressed well, and it doesn't take forever for the heroine to figure out that her idols are tarnished (another chapter of her infatuation would have killed it). I also liked the supporting cast. The relationship between the sisters was lovely.I wasn't surprised by much, but then, I didn't expect to be. I wanted a fairytale and got what I paid for."
5,Excellent!,The story was a little slow at first but after a chapter or two I found it to be totally delightful. So much so that I didn't want to put it down. Next time I'm at the library I'll be looking for her other books.
5,Just a lovely story!,"From start to finish this is a thoroughly enjoyable read. The world-building is subtle but splendid, the characters interesting and solid (men AND women, always such a joy to see) and the story itself never lags. I don't believe this is listed as a YA novel, but it's entirely suitable as such and will be found enjoyable by people of all ages. I'd love to read more written in this world, but honestly, I don't know if re-visiting it would be necessary.If you enjoy authors like Robin McKinley, then I believe you'll enjoy this a great deal, and it's definitely convinced me to read more by Sharon Shinn! I can't believe I've missed out on her all this time."
5,I'm really starting to like Sharon Shinn,This is such a sweet book. I really enjoyed how the main character changed as she grew up. Her changing views on the people around her gave this coming of age story believability. I also liked the setting. It's was more of a historical setting than a fantasy one but the fantasy element was still there. I enjoyed this book so much I've decided to read anything by Sharon Shinn I can get a hold of.
1,Worth Less Than Nothing,"While the book offers some interesting info on the physical media, it covers primarily a couple software packages that the author doesn't even seem to think are really great. It really doesn't present anything that you won't get with the instruction manuals with the hardware/software you buy for burning a CD or DVD. It's ""worth less than nothing"" because it costs time and postage to return the book."
5,Best Kept Secret,"This album from start to finish is flawless. The musical style of [The]Caseworker is completely original and it shows. Trying to describe the sound the band has on this album would do it no justice. Extremely chill cuts with melodic beats and chords, to the faint lyrics that put you into a trance. Completely soothing yet dark at the same time. Most would classify this as indy rock, as would I.However, they are in their own category and rightly so. Track 4 is the only cut I don't care for on this album. The abrasive sound of track 4 is a completely seperate sound from the rest of the album. This album is a must have for ANY collection.I listen to this CD at least once a day...and so should you. You won't be dissapointed."
5,a loaded baked potato!,"As with all artists I've listened to I like some of Jones stuff much better than others of his. overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this collection."
4,Nicely done but....,"This soundtrack is nicely put together and an excellent complement to the film. It is not quite as eclectic as the Desperado soundtrack. Tito Larriva, who fronted the fantastic group Tito and Tarantula, the house band in 'Dusk Until Dawn', makes an appearance. Salma Hayek does a very nice job with Siente Mi Amour and Brian Setzer contributes a sizzling version of Malaguena. The highlight of the soundtrack for me is the wonderful Traeme Paz as performed by the incredible Patricia Vonne. Vonne was a smash hit at the last huge South by Southwest music bash in Austin and her haunting rendition is nothing short of fantastic. All in all the soundtrack is very nicely done. But I would have liked a bit more of talents like Tito and Patricia Vonne and a bit less generic background music."
5,Outstanding music CD for a near silly movie,"OK, the movie is a bit over the top and thus loses its effectiveness, but the music....the music...wow! The guitar playing is incredible. Me Gustas Tu is a nice touch. You won't be disappointed with the music CD."
4,que viva Robert Rodriguez,"I saw the movie & couldn't wait to order the CD. I ordered the Mexico & Mariachis CD also. Great move, as it turns out the last 3-4 songs from the movie CD are on the other CD. ?? Anyway, these will stay in my changer thru the summer. I love all the tracks! Mi favoritos? Siente Mi Amor and Cuka Rocka! y Pistolaro tambien! Sabrosa!"
5,Blue Majic,"This is good quality stuff. I use it for just about everything like my car, golf shoes, plastic and vinyl. Worth the price."
5,BLUE MAGIC 850-06 LEATHER & VINYL CONDITIONER,"THIS IS MY SECOND RE-ORDER FOR THIS PRODUCT - EXCELLENT, NON-GREASY ANDEASY TO APPLY PREFERABLY WITH THE AUTO TERRY CLOTHS - THE CLOTHS AFTER-WARD ARE GREAT FOR DUSTING FURNITURE AS THIS IS NOT GREASY PRODUCT. THELABEL ALSO READS FOR FURNITURE AND ON MOST OF THE PIECES I TESTED IT WORKED VERY WELL CLEANING THE WOOD AND QUICKLY REMOVING DUST AND STAINSWHICH BY THE WAY IT ALSO REMOVED STAINS AND SPILLS ON LEATHER. NOT GREASYTO THE HANDS AT ALL WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT - ALSO SOFTENS AND SEEMS TORE-CONDITION THE LEATHER - USED IT FOR MY EXPENSIVE COACH BAG - AGAIN VERYGOOD. USED IT ON KITCHEN WOOD CUPBOARDS - AGAIN REMOVED DIRT AND STAINSESPECIALLY EXCELLENT AROUND THE HANDLE WHERE DISCOLORATIONS AND STAINSBUILD UP - ALWAYS TEST AREA BEFORE USING....I DO THIS WITH ALL PRODUCTSI USE - THIS WAY THERE ARE NO BAD EXPERIENCES..."
4,Good Set of Early Glen Campbell Work,"One of Campbell's favorite albums, ""Gentle on My Mind"" boasts great production and sound quality, and though there are no Jimmy Webb songs here, the others do very well, especially Campbell's cover versions of country and pop tunes: ""Catch the Wind,"" ""Bowling Green,"" and ""It's Over"" by Donovan, the Everly Brothers, and Jimmie Rodgers, respectively."
5,Glen Campbell,"If you like Glen Campbell you will like this!Glen has a way of getting under your skin but in a very pleasant way.He makes your very nerve cells want to dance when you hear him sing,he has a great voice and these songs are right for that voice,so if you want to relax and enjoy music this album is a good one to start."
5,Childhood Memories,"My father has this on an LP. As a young girl of 7 or 8 years of age, I had a huge crush on Glen Campbell. My father would play LP's for me when I was sick as his way of helping me to feel better. And it always worked. I loved this album back then, and I love it now on CD. I'd long forgotten a couple of my ""favorite"" songs until I listened to the samples off the CD. While I don't listen to alot of his new music, I love the old classics, they are just ""Gentle On My Mind""!"
4,It's an anthology that's well worth waiting for....,"The strength of Deborah Allen's soprano voice shows in this ""greatest hits"" collection from the past 24 years. From her signature 1983 hit ""Baby I Lied"" to cuts which saw less air play, her emotion shows clearly through. Deborah Allen is indeed a bridge between the classic country sound and today's modern country diva."
1,Leaks constantly,"The only thing I can say that is good about this iron is that it gets hot. From the beginning, this iron left water spots on clothes, then it began to leak even more. I am constantly re-ironing wet spots and stopping to dry my hands, while the place where the iron sits on the board is soaked. The cord only retracts after several attempts and then only part way. I would not buy this iron again and am contacting the company about getting a refund. I have had it about 3 months."
2,Great While It Lasted....,"At first, my husband and I really liked this iron. It shut off after not being in use for a while and the retractable cord was awesome for storing the iron. It seemed to iron fabric nicely and quickly. It put out a great amount of steam. We are not heavy-duty ironers, only about 4-5 shirts a week. After about a month or two, we noticed that the cord wasn't retracting very well and that the auto shut off would go into effect much quicker. We still managed to get our ironing done, though. Then, yesterday, the iron just died. The auto shut off feature took over always. As soon as you turned the iron on, the little red indicator light would start blinking and the iron refused to get even warm. It was a bit scary because the handle got pretty warm, but nothing else did. I would never buy this again. We bought it in October and 3 1/2 months later it won't work..."
2,There are way better irons,"I bought this less than a year ago and it has already broken down. Just stopped heating. I can't seem to find a iron that lasts anymore. I had a Black & Decker that lasted about 10 years. I bought another B&D for $50 after a recommendation in Consumer Reports. That one last a year and I bought this one. Aside from just no heating there are other things that I don't like about this iron. 1. It's hard to fill water. Water spills all over the place when filling. My B&D had a little hole that allowed air to escape, so no spillage. 2. The reservoir cap is flimsy. You have to be careful to not break it off. 3. Because it has a retractable cord, the cord doesn't stick up away from the iron so it gets in the way. 4. The cord is too short. Doesn't give me enough to manuever around. I think I'll go back to a cheaper B&D iron if I have to keep replacing one every year. Maybe I'll get lucky."
2,Problem iron,The first time I used this iron both the spray and the steam worked.The very next day the spray did not work...and after all these months is still not working.I would not purchase a Sunbeam product again.
1,Buy something else!,"I bought this when my old sunbeam iron died. I had god luck with my old Sunbeam, but this one is just awful! I've only had it a month and it is already spitting, dripping and leaking water. It also takes a long time to heat up. I will be returning it to where I bought it & will buy a Rowenta or Singer model instead."
1,"Leaky, leaky",From the day I bought this product it was flawed. It leaks from the cap that covers the hole where you pour the water in. I am returning it tomorrow.
3,Disappointed,"I brought this iron, it looked nice and sturdy, however i cant get the iron on and it drips water. i have to unplug it to at least get it to heat up. but once it heats up i have heck to keep it on and hot. any suggestions??"
3,Old Edition is Exactly the Same,"I didn't get the book in time for my first class, so I found a copy of the 5th ed. at the library. I should have just stuck to the library edition and saved $25 because the only update I noticed was the cover."
5,"Fast, Good, Easy, Helpful","I received the book I had ordered in less than a week. It was in great condition. I was very pleased. It was an easy read and was very helpful to me for the film class I was taking on American Westerns, in which I had to write three research papers."
1,TWO THUMBS DOWN,"I am currently a film major who is being forced to read this book. Let me say that so far I am only to chapter three and have suffered through every page of it. It is filled with basic, common sense, (i.e., the best way to write about film is to take notes during the screening. and if you can, it's good to see the movie more than once), which is explained in several pages. Give me a break. Not only does he present basic knowlnedge but he repeats himself in so many words. The truth is, the only way to successfully analize film is to develop an eye for symbolism. No book, I don't care who writes it, can teach you that. It is something that must be personally developed. Why someone would waste their time writing a book trying to teach people how to do that blows my mind. I give it one star, cause after all, everyone deserves a little comething for at least trying."
4,excellent guide,"This book is an invaluable guide to writing about film. If you've never taken a film class, you need a book like this to get you used to the vocabulary, style and format of film criticism and theory. Numerous examples and lucid prose make this book easy to use and to read."
5,Intelligence and accessibility,"This a marvelous book, packed with information and much more accessible than far more expensive books. It's the perfect companion for almost any film course since it not only introduces students to the language and methods of film analysis (including how to take notes) but does so while guiding students through the work of writing a good essay (with great suggestions for doing research). The writing is clear and accurate (with none of the errors referred to by the Kenosha reviewer). I recommend it without hesitation to all students of film."
3,Could be better.,"This book fills a niche--a short and essential guide in a course in which the numbers of other texts simply don't leave room for one of the more comprehensive, ambitious introductory texts to film studies. But it's hard to justify a price above $10 for this slim volume. The text just isn't that informative or helpful. Moreover, the previous edition contained egregious errors--ranging from misspellings to identifying the protagonist of ""Apocalypse Now"" as Marlowe rather than Willard."
1,I received the wrong edition.,"I placed my order for the 7th edition of this book, and received the 5th edition. My one star is no reflection on the book itself."
2,Camisole with a Lack of Support Bra,"I am very disappointed with this product. The built in support bra does not support at all. It is as if I'm wearing a regular tank top without a bra. In fact while practicing yoga today, thankfully at home in private, I had an incident where one [...] popped out. I can't believe I'm writing this online, but I feel the need to express how little support this Camisole has. The only good thing about it is that it looks pretty on me...that is if it stays on or I stay in it.:)"
2,Cute but torso length too short,"Granted this probably would be my fault as I obviously didn't pay close enough attention to the pic of the shirt as it clearly shows the model's mid section slightly. However, even though I""m a size small and fit I don't like my belly showing regardless so the several tops I ordered in this style are just collecting dust in my workout clothes drawer. Just be aware that these shirts are quite short, only a bit longer than, say, a half shirt. Quality and customer service however are excellent."
2,Misleading product name and description.,"Has absolutely no bra/support AT ALL so I don't understand why it says it does in the product description, let alone in the PRODUCT TITLE. The proportions are off as well. I have a very small build and ordered a medium. Big mistake! I should have gotten a small. The tank goes all the way up to my underarms making it uncomfortable around the area, but it's not too big of a deal due to the fact that it is a soft, cotton material...not particularly something I want to work out in. Although it is tight under the underarm area, it is very large around the stomach/waist area. I don't think this product should be advertised as an ""athletic"" tank; I am more likely to sleep in this than work out in it."
5,The Show Is Awsome...,"To the reviewer before me- Kiki Lars, before you jump to conclusions... Winx Club was released in Italy, then last year it was dubbed and put on the Fox Box... Way before W.I.T.C.H was released! So in other words Disney copied Italy's Winx Cub! The information you researched was false! The W.I.T.C.H comics might of been released before the Winx Club books came out, but the Winx Club show was released first! Then the W.I.T.C.H books came out, and a little later on the Winx Club books came... Then the W.I.T.C.H show was released...Also for the fact that 4Kids dubbed the show with very well known actors such as Dan Green... The show is wonderful... And so popular that even Cartoon Network started showing it...I have the dvd, and it's really cool... A mixture of fantasy, action, and drama... You'll get hooked..."
2,Not a huge fan of it.,"Didnt think their outfits are appropriate for my 4 year old. I really didnt see the show but just watching the commercials was enough. My daughter is the one who selected the download, she watched it once and then I deleted it. Not worth it."
1,What episodes does this contain?,Am I missing something? What episodes does this DVD contain? If it is just the first 6 shows then forget it.... We have seen the first 6 over and over for free on the Fox Kids website.
3,Its OK,My girls didnt realy care for the Winx club that much. I think its just more there personal taste than anything to do with the show. IT was ok.
4,Winx Club,"This DVD contains the 1st 5 eposides of the the Winx Club Series. The series is about Bloom, an Earth girl who realizes she has magical fairy powers. Bloom travels to another world to study magic and makes new fairy friends Stella, Flora, Musa and Techna. She also meets mean witches Icy, Stormy and Darcy who try to use their power against her and the Red Fountain boys who are studying about Heroics and Bravery. My six year loves the Winx Club. Although the eposides play over and over again on Cartoon network I bought the DVD to take with us on long trips because she never seems to tire of it."
4,Pretty good show,"Yeah, yeah. People are annoyed to heck about Winx Club resembling W.I.T.C.H, and it is a little bit annoying, thanks to the resemblance. But that does NOT mean that this is a bad show, because it isn't! For the right people, usually the mystical theme that gets you. My brother and sister like it quite a bit, and so do I. Bash all you want about the show, show's how immature you can become over a simple show. Anyway; this is great for people who like mystical/magical themes."
5,"Welcome To Magic, Indeed.","I agree with the others, specialy, Christina (a kid at heart). It is about time this was released on DVD, and wanting and wishing alot more to come soon as well.I am an adult at the age myself of 30, but still love the Winx Club, and the show really also brings out the kid in me.This is really a wonderful cartoon and story for all younger girls who may be into this. This year will be a very nice 'Winx Year' with new dolls just out, the DVD now and another one on the way, and more toys and such, plus the Winx Club video games due out in this Nov. til Feb. of next year, this is indeed great times to enjoy and love the Winx Club.~Amy"
4,pretty good,This DvD is part of a good series. Nice plot and characters with some twists in both to make the series more interesting. As with most younger animation the plot can be rather predictable at times but it does contain some unexpected twists to the series. The animation is good and expected for the young generation. If anyone has kids they will probably enjoy this series. This is a good family DVD.
2,ok but original is better,"I was excited to see that winx club was coming back on tv, it is a series my daughter has loved for a few years now. I just wish they would show the original series that aired in english that came from italy. the story lines are a little more in depth and the voices are different. for those who have never seen the winx club before....if you ever watch the original you'll know. the specials that aired on nickelodeon skipped a lot of detail that is in the original."
5,Awesome! Thanks Nick!,"Really lovin' these new ""updated"" specials of the first two seasons of the show! I've only watched the first one so far, but I'm more impressed with it than I was with the awful 4kids Dub. I do wish Nick had gotten the rights to redub the entire first two seasons, instead of doing four hour long specials, but I can't complain too much. The characters seem to have more depth in this than in the 4kids dub, the story makes much more sense, and the animation is absolutely gorgeous! Btw, I'm a 20-something college student, and I've become addicted to this show, so it's not just for kids. :)"
4,Reckless Eyeballin,Received in good condition and in a timely manner. Starletta Duvall Mysteries are my favorite.
5,Simply phenomenal,"An incredibly powerful and haunting film. My only criticism is that the climactic trip to New York feels artificial and tacked-on. I considered marking it down a star due to the art show scenes, but the rest is so powerful that it easily earns five.I hope Mark is happy and has been able to continue his life in Marwencol without too much disruption (Assuming that is what he wants, of course.)."
2,not impressed with defective workmanship,"The first tent we ordered had a rainfly that did not fit. A new rainfly solved the problem, but in less than 2 days of using the tent for camping, the zipper split on the door. We received a replacement tent, and when we set it up to make sure every part was present and functional, found a large defect in the mesh ceiling window - just like a run in pantyhose - that would let bugs in. Amazon.com and the company who manufactures this tent were both very satisfactory in customer service and resolving this process, but we are now tentless and recovering from all the frustration this particular purchase caused us before looking into getting another tent (of a different brand). Maybe other purchasers of this tent did not have the same problems as we did, and we were just unfortunate to receive several defective tents, but I cannot recommend this tent to others based on our experience."
4,great tent,"This was a gift to our children (5 & 3) for Christmas. We have used it only twice (it is winter & we live in NC). We enjoyed our nights out, except it was a little cold, again it is winter. The only down side was the instructions. If you aren't familiar with putting up a tent, it could have been a real chore. Otherwise a great tent."
4,Very nice cookie pan,This cookie pan is extremely easy to clean. The non-stick coating is the best we have used. The only con that we've found is there are two small drain holes on the underside of each handle. The edges of the holes are a little sharp.
1,Not a good buy,"This fax machine is very error-prone. The ability for the fax machine to process incoming faxes when linked to an answering machine was intermittent; often times clients would have to re-send items multiple times. The build quality is very poor and the front access door is built to withstand only a few openings and closings before the hinge system fails. As a person who expects electronic items to work, and as a person who takes very good care of his electronic items, I was extremely disappointed with this unit."
3,Fax and Printer,"The fax function works well enough, but is not outstanding; I like it as a network printer except that it has a tendency to lock up with an error message if the print job indicates legal size paper; then it takes too much of an effort to clear out the message and reset the machine. The front door opens poorly; cheap design. It would have been great to have an easier way of feeding legal size paper than having to open the lower tray, taking out the paper, expanding the tray, then placing the legal size paper, then repeating again to place letter size paper. Otherwise I believe it will serve me well."
2,disappointing - maybe I'm an idiot,"I really didn't have good luck with this fax printer. It would try to send a fax once and then give up if it got a busy signal or other interruption. It would then make this really annoying alarm sound that basically meant ""tough luck buddy"". I tried working with the settings but couldn't figure it out. I tried using it as a backup printer but the driver I downloaded didn't work. The wizard software wouldn't recognize the printer being plugged in even though the computer did. It did make copies okay. If anyone wants one, they can have mine."
2,"Dreamlike & I don't mean dreamy, I mean weird!","The cover on this book certainly is indicative of the weirdness of its written contents. At first glance the cover image seemed to be some sort of creepy beast glaring out at its audience. Possibly that was the intent, hence the title? Then it became apparent the subject was a very unfocused woman with wind blowing her hair. For me, this image was somehow disturbing and repelling. Finishing the first story ""The Ugliest Pilgrim"", I felt less than enchanted, but tried to read the next one. It was so confusing and cryptic, I left it and tried for a third. By this time I was fed up and decided I would not waste my time any further. Betts' writing style may excite some as being oh-so-hip. Personally, though, I found it much too weird, not to mention unfocused (like the book cover), for my tastes. I love to read many kinds of writings, but this author left me more than unsatisfied! Oh well!"
5,it's cool,"This CD is very good. I think the songs have a nice beet, are very nice as far as lyrics go, and just all around cool. I first listened to them from the ""American Pie"" soundtrack. Ever since I heard ""Wishen"" I knew that this band was golden."
1,Bill of Rights For Dummies,"I gambled and lost on this one. The Bill of Rights is an important subject, requiring (I think) a bit of explanation along with each Amendment. One would expect to hear something about why each Amendment was included, what it means, and what it doesn't mean.Unfortunately, this video does none of these things. It simply shows the text of each Amendment, then spends the entire rest of the video showing film clips from the news and asking, ""What Right are these people talking about?"". At the end of it all, the student is apparently able to identify a Right as being (sort of) in the Bill of Rights, but that's all.This tape is marketed to public schools, according to the tape's intro, but as an educational tool, I deem it worthless. Even at the level of K-Grade 2, one can easily imagine a presentation that is more informative, more thought-provoking, and less sleep-inducing."
2,Subsumed,"This book is contained in its entirety in the bookThe Big Book of Backyard Projects: Walls, Fences, Paths, Patios, Benches, Chairs & More. Unknowingly, I purchased both books. On its own, I don't know that I would recommend it. As a part of the more encompassing book, it works well."
5,Great stuffs!,"Love the sound of this SACD Jazz Sampler. The SACD playback through my highend headphones system sounds spectacular as well as my 5.1 surround. The minute I heard this album, I had to get a hand on one. Highly Recommended."
4,Good jazz SACD sampler,"I'm not a jazz fan, but purchased this SACD for testing the performance of my new SACD & DVDA player. I own a lot of DVD audio discs, but this one is my first SACD.Sound is good and well separated on the analogue 6 channel output designed for playing such a disc. But the music taste of the disc producer is strictly a jazz taste which doesn't meet that of a lot of music listeners. Beija-Flor, Come with me and Watermelon man are fantastic.As a conclusion, it's a reliable SACD sampler but not comparable to DVDA which has almost the same sound fidelity, and include further videos, lyrics, photos and interviews."
2,Multichannel SACDs,"This is a multichannel SACDMy rating is based on how I like the Music and the Multichannel mix. On this recording the mix is good, but the Music is Traditional Jazz, witch I find rather boring. I'm more in to modern chilled jazz."
5,Awesome!,"I loved this book and its sequel so much I did something I have never done before - as soon as I was finished I turned them over and started reading them all over again! They have everything you could want - a heroine that grows and mellows, a hero to die for, lust, love, betrayal and history set in a country I fell in love with on my first visit. Great author and I look forward to devouring everything else she has written with the same gusto!"
5,"out of print, but well worth the search","I FINALLY got my hands on a copy of this book and ended up reading it non-stop until four in the morning. I got hooked on Canham books with her medievals, Through A dark Mist and In the Shadow of Midnight, then kept going back for more, even hunting down almost all of the out-of-print backlist. Anyone who hasn't read any of them is missing out on pure adventure and romance. This author doesn't just tell a story, she lets you see it, breathe it, hear it and take part in the heart-stopping action"
3,It was OK but too much war talk...,"I liked this book but was pretty bored in many parts. There was way too much talk of the eminent battle. I felt like the who, what, where, when, why & how of the eminent battle took up about 1/3 of the book & I'm not reading this book for the battle I'm reading it for the romance & adventure that goes along with that. I felt like Catherine & Alex were together very little in this book but I did really enjoy those parts when they came. If you don't mind hearing all about the King's & Prince's & all the ranks under that then I'd say give this book a try but for me personally I'm hoping that the start of the next book in this series starts off really good because I don't know if I'll last through a long & boring battle story. I want the romance."
3,Not as Good as Expected So-So Read,"The reviews lead me to believe that this story would be great but it wasn't for me. I think it is a nice story with good characters and plot but now a whole lot of emotions, intrigue or romance. Certainly nothing steamy. I am starting the second in the series so maybe that one will be better."
3,So so...,"This book did have a somewhat unique plot as far as romance novels go but I did find myself skipping a bit -- too much government coverage. I also had to skip about the last 50 pages (too much war stuff here). I did like the hero Alex but the heroine was just kind of like a dumb, troublesome 18 year old with a body he could not resist."
3,As Expected,"It is what the picture shows. Mine had some junk on the surface that took some time to get off. Also it was more of a pain to mount than similar products I have purchased in the past. That being said, Now that it is on the wall it looks nice and keeps me organized. The shipping took 2 weeks longer than they said it would."
5,"Well planned, deep, wonderful reading.","The thing that really catches me about this book and the ones that follow it is the depth that is given to the characters. It is usually hard to find a series that focuses on the same characters all the way through without repeating itself. Del and Tiger both have so much mystery in their pasts that their growth is able to span the series easily. Roberson doesn't give away all their secrets at once but lets them grow slowly, giving us glimpses of their pasts and letting unsolved issues affect their present day actions. As a martial artist, I'm also always glad to find books with realistic fighting. The training and psychological side of the sword-dance is also very intriguing to me. A very intelligent, appealing story."
4,"Good, Solid Story","The book starts out with a lot of action, has a great story that is not predictable. Tiger is a charming rogue, though I felt that the further into the book you delve, the more you find your original impression was misleading.The relationship that grows between the two main characters is prickly, but appreciable. Overall, this book is the best in the series."
3,"interesting story, amateur writing","The story is interesting, as are some of the ideas. The thought of semi-living swords is interesting, though you get a bit tired of hearing about it later in the series. Unfortunately, the writing leaves much to be desired. The characters are clichéd and tend to repeat themselves over and over again. I got sick of hearing about Del's oath, and even sicker of the word Hoolies. It is an easy read though, and is a good way to pass an afternoon if you don't have much else to do. I would pick it up at a library, rather than buy it."
3,Not bad at all,"Seeing as how I read the book about 5 years ago and still remember it, it must be quite good. I really don't remember it enough to give it a in-depth review, but I couldn't just write nothing after I read the other review. Let's put it this way - If you can't remember that this is a FANTASY book, and you expect everything to be politically correct (ie. no male chauvinism) then don't read it. But if you want a good book, with a neat premise, and very interesting characters, I really think you would enjoy it. Saying it sucks is just too narrow minded. I really don't think that person should be reading fantasy"
2,Strong Female Character=Heroine on Par with Little Mermaid,"[Spoiler in the text] I originally picked up this book because I wanted a new genre to try with my husband. Since the back cover implied a strong male and female character we thought it would be a good choice. The male chauvinist protagonist didn't bother me, it added some character. What angered me was the inability of the female character to actually win a fight. The big climatic battle scene has Del being pushed out of the ring for big strong warrior guy to save her because she is too dumb to realize the other warrior has picked up new tricks and adjust to them. But never fear, warrior guy is there despite the fact that he is supposedly in a poor physical state. If the reader is expecting a strong female character who is capable of taking care of herself, it would be nice if she actually won a fight, especially in the climatic battle scene."
5,review,"I love the way the characters have to adjust to each other, and change their outlook to who the person really is, not what their ousides suggest."
5,I've never devoured a book like that before..,"Wow. Never have I ever enjoyed a book so thoroughly or had one that was able to hold my attention as tightly as this one did. An excellent quick read (it is a little shorter) that doesn't belabor the boring parts of the story by filling in extra details that don't matter. Straight to the point without being too rushed, beautiful character development (by the end you feel like you've actually spent a fair amount of time with Tiger and Del), it keeps you on the edge of your seat and reading. I've never been able to finish a 250+ page book in less than a day before until I picked up Jennifer's first novel in this series. I can't wait until I pick up the next one!"
4,Great Series! Thanks Lora!!,"my fantasy chick friend, Lulu recommended these series of books and they are a lot of fun! Robeson does a credible job of telling the story from the male (sandtiger) point of view,my only complaint is that there isn't enough books in the series!haha I guess she just wants toleave us wanting more!"
5,Great read,I had never heard of Jennifer Roberson before I found this book on Amazon. I ordered it not knowing what to expect but enjoyed it so much I immediately had to buy the rest in the series. I love the characters and the way they relate to one another. When I bought the book I had read a review stating that Jennifer Roberson was simply trying to force her opinions on others about feminism but I only found it to be the way a man and woman would behave who both thought they had the right of it. She did not make the woman out to be perfect or right all the time and both of the main characters learned and grew to be more accepting of the worth of others for who they are. But I want to stress that this book had a great storyline and characters and that is what caused me to stay stuck with Del and Tiger until the end (book 6).
1,I would not have published it.,"This is among the worst books that I have read.I found this book juvenile and annoying. This story seems to be the author's private fantasy, and (in my opinion) should never have been published. Everything revolves around Del. Del is blond, beautiful, tough (but sensitive on the inside), able to kick ass in a fight, and is always right because the story is designed around making her look good, and feeding Roberson's vicarious vanity.This book is neither original nor skillfully written, and I would not recommend it under any circumstances."
4,A great comparison between magic and skill,I thought that the book was great. It gives you a cross between loyalty and commitment that is truely one of a kind. It is the best book that i have read in a long time.
1,In the name of Iran,"This book on chapter one embarked on ancient Iran fairy tail history. Chapter two, author without any kind of prepartion took a journy in 60s, 70s, and 80s political turmoil in Iran. The story lacked introduction, body, climax and proper conclusion. The characters were not fully developed and there was no real story line. For example, author wrote about Samrad, who would do coup de grace and at the same time, he was a political prisoner. Samrad fate was unkown.Mr. MILANI trasnlated word ""peykar"" as beautiful. However, ""payker"" means war in Persian language.All in all, this book lacked proper story telling structure.Please be advise that this comment is meant to be constructive critism and there is no personal hate against Dr. Milani, as a matter of fact, I do not know him whatsoever, for further reading kindly read the comment section.Thank you.Doroud va sepas faravon"
3,"Neat, but old","Only covers a few dozen dinosaur species, and some of the pictures look (smell) scientifically outdated and old-timey. But generally a pretty cool book. My 2-year old (a dino connaisseur) was lukewarm on it."
5,Ultimate Dinosaur book,A very good book. The book provides a lot of info on dinosaurs. the A to Z section gives brief descriptions of many dinosaurs. I especially love the page about spinosaurus
1,Where's My Wrench For A Leaking Sink?,"One, the blasted thing is made in China. So, I know the quality is cheap and the manufacture wanting.Two, I ordered on June 29, 2009; it took the seller three blasted days to ship this plumbing tool, a tool I need to fix a leaking sink.Three, I ain't received it yet, and it's three days passed the last date they gave themselves to get it to me (July 9, 2009; or maybe it was 2010, my apologies).I was the lock nut wrench for ordering this."
3,OKAY PRODUCT,"BOUGHT TO PROTECT MY GAS TANK! IT'S A FIT FOR MY 2012 CRUZE BUT IT'S NOT EASY TO LOCK & UNLOCK, TAKES TOO LONG!!"
2,Not what I hoped,The holes around the big hole are too small. The pictures show barely the face and I can't use it.
4,A redundant question,"There is no doubt that Lt. Cmdr. Pitzer had a wealth of knowledge concerning the death of JFK. The work by Heiner is excellent and well documented. With the veil of secrecy surrounding this case it was probably very difficult for the author to get as much information as he did. There are still many unanswered questions: who knew his role and had the means to gain access to his office, who gave the order, and who covered it up? These are familiar questions to all aspects of this case. Still a great read and highly recommended. Chris Petit"
1,lot's of promise- no pay off.,"I'm certainly not a JFK assassination buff to the extent of many potential readers reading these reviews, however I've read perhaps 75-100 books on the subject over the past 35 years and this one was one of the most unsatisfying. It's a short book (just 120 pages) so you can read it cover to cover in one long sitting. That said, it seemed the author worked hard to extend it to that length. He gets off on tangents that seem irrelevant to the primary focus of his topic. He spends a lot of time and words building up the credibiliy of his primary witness, only to reveal near the end that this witness has credibility issues. A few interesting questions are raised but the author has only supposition and conflicting evidence to reveal. When I finished I was frustrated...and thinking that all of this could have easily been distilled into a medium length magazine article"
1,Horrrible,Exactly how can Los Lobos be bad?The price at 16.95 with a Cd should give you a clue.Whoever produced this should look for a new vocation absolutely horrible although unlikethe previous reviewer I tried to watch it twice.Each time I gave up this is nothing more than noise and very fatiguing.I managed to listen to the whole Cd and it was the same.The band brags in the video that this was the first time they practiced for an event.My be they should go back to not practicing.What a waste of 17.00 I would highly discourage buying it however if you are that determinedI know someone who has a copy played twice available at a huge discount.
1,Very Strange,I like the recent stuff from this band and this is not what I was expecting. A lot of acoustic material; mariachi type songs that you would hear in a Mexican restaurant.
3,Disappointing audio,"This is my favorite Los Lobos album. Great performance but sound is disappointing.1- The center channel is mixed way too low. I have to crank up my center +10db for a reasonable balance.2- harsh sounding recording with too much of the room mixed in. Poor venue sound-wise or mixer doesn't understand surround.3- Berlin's sax is mixed way too low, have to strain to hear him even when he solos.I have a reference system in a well treated room. I have double checked other blurays and they sound fine, so no system issues.I will keep it thought, music is still worthwhile."
4,Good show,"Music great, show very good, interviews were a nice bonus. All in all I would recommend to any fan of their music. Video quality could be better, but given when it was shot very acceptable."
2,not live,"music was smashing but the interveiws killed the insight of being live , more a documentry , with a los lobos kick ."
4,Chess Teacher good for beginners,"We bought this for our 7-year-old grandson and did not get to check it out in depth. It looks like it will be a good beginner set for him. In addition to pictures in the instruction book, each piece has arrows showing how it can be moved. The board folds into a square instead of just in half, which means it has a cut halfway across. That might be a weak spot in durability of the set. It will have to be placed on a solid surface to be really stable. It's OK for a young beginner, and a better board could be used when needed."
2,I didn't like this one.,"It's not really very much like the Enchantments series and it takes far too long for to get to the real plot of the book.I liked the atmosphere of her last series,but this one is just depressing."
4,Interesting Subject Matter...Fallen Angels~The Grigori,"Although the storyline took a while to set up, this book packs a wonderful *punch* in the arm of mainstream fantasy fiction. The story of fallen angels and their interaction with man throughout time is a bold and refreshing change, as well as its setting in a contemporary timeframe.I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to more of the Grigori Trilogy!"
3,"Good body, mediocre end...","The book was a bit hard to get into, and certain parts were hard to accept without a bit of revulsion, but after a time, I got past that. Constantine develops her characters wounderfully and gives them much life. That was the high point in the novel. The storyline was a bit basic, but also worthy of some praise. My only complaint comes in regards to the ending. It seemed very rushed and some of the characters that we were led to believe had an important role in things just dropped out and took no part in the climax. Maybe there is a sequel that I missed, but that struck me as odd. Overall I give it 3.5 stars."
3,good book but it's not enough,This book have some good reference information but it contains some mistakes. i passed my 510 exam. now i am preparing the 511 and 512. i am relying on this book but mainly on notes help.
3,Don't rely on this book alone to pass the exam(s),"This book is a good to get you going in the right direction, but it doesn't provide you with any information to pass the exam(s). I found this out after reading the first section for Exam 510. I studied the section, found the errors and took the practice test at the end of the book. After all of that, I had no clue to the answers when taking the practice exam by SelfTest software. I passed exam 510 using the Domino Help referenced in the selftest. For the next two exams, I relied on the selftest software and used the book as a high level overview. (Also, found more errors which I emailed the authors about and the errata sheet still has not been updated.) I didn't even bother doing the sample questions in the back. I have my CLP thanks to selftest software (passed all on the first try)."
5,They're not people!,"This is the greatest metal album of all time. Possibly the best album of any sort. It never has, nor ever will be equaled.Explosively bombastic, creative drumming, and aggressive, deranged, yet thoughtful vocals combine with ruthlessly heavy, swinging sweeping spiral, reverseable off-kilter catchy, putrid punk mad mozart mardi-gras walk the plank fretwork, where each segment is played once and discarded. The result is a seamless twisting tunnel through which each song is a progression, a war, a life lived from beginning to end.If you've listened to rock and roll for any length of time, you'll hear these guys play a part and go, ""Oh yeah. That's how that's supposed to sound.""It can take repeated listens to hear everything that's packed into this. Even then it still sounds fresh and punchy as ever."
2,High hopes left on the platform.,"I wanted to like Wichita Lineman--both because the digital version is inexpensive and because it recreates the original album's track listing. This album, however, makes my stomach turn with its dreadful string arrangements. The flavor of country is way watered down, and the album is plagued with just about every cheesy attribute of late 60's/early 70's pop music."
3,Glen Campbell,"One of Glen Campbell's first and best records. Excellent version of ""Wichita Lineman"", the Bee Gee's ""Words"" are stand-outs here."
5,We Hate what we Do not Know.,"""We Hate what we do not Know."" Such is how the book starts. Mr Hofmann sheds the lignt in a very concise and summarized manner to some of the major misconcetpions about Islam, a religion so much misunderstood by the West. This book,written by a German dignitary convert,is an excellent introduction to Islam to the West.Simply put: a Must Read."
1,"Bukhari Hadith identify women as ""deficient in intellect""","Few non-Muslims are even aware of the Hadith, a huge collection of the sayings of Mohammed and episodes from his life. However, reading those documents is very revealing. The misogyny is unrelenting. Mohammed is directly quoted as stating that women are deficient in intellect and that is why the Koran counts their testimony as being half the value of that of a man.Islam is suffused with the cruelty of slavery. Mohammed left many rules for slaveowners and over 11 million Black Africans were kidnapped from their homes for service in the Ottoman empire and its precursors.The Hadith reveal Mohammed as the violent war lord that he was."
1,Crap,"Please... Monstrosity is terrible and i know alot of grind and death bands who are much superior then them. Not realy one good song here and the lirycs truly dumb plus it gets boring and old--sounds like crappy cannibal corpse which sucks! Skip this insted check out scar culture,lost soul,phobia,embalmer,kalitas,ac,mortician,vomitory,immolation,death,skinless,rune, and others who actullie sound good but leave garbage like cannibal corpse and monstrosity alone... In the trash, where they belong!"
4,good for 17months,"my son is sort of a young potty trainer. He is doing great and we bought this seat to take with us. He has no problems with this seat...my only thought after getting wet this week is that I wish it had a splash guard! but I know that may be impossible for a folding potty seat. I bring along with me a splash guard from another toddler seat that is no good as a potty chair but Iatleast I can use the pieces!! I have had no problems with this seat on any toilet, I just line up the front of the seats and my son sits and goes!"
1,My Daughter Won't Use It!,"I seem to be the only naysayer among the reviewers of this product. I wish my daughter would use it, because I love the compact size. However, she simply won't use it. If we sit her on it when we're out in public she refuses to go. It sounds great for some children, but it definitely doesn't work for our family."
1,THIS SEAT IS NOT STURDY AND DOES CATCH YOUR CHILD'S SKIN,"THIS SEAT DOES NOT FIT WELL ON ELONGATED TOILET BOWLS. I TRIED TO USE IT ON A PUBLIC TOILET AND WHEN I TRIED TO PUT MY DAUGHTER ON IT, IT SLIPPED OFF AND FOLDED UP, PINCHING HER SKIN. I THINK I WILL BE BRINGING A REGULAR SEAT WHEN WE GO AWAY AGAIN. MAYBE GRACO SHOULD PUT A LOCKING MECHANISM ON THE BACK OF THE SEAT SO IT WON'T CLOSE ON A CHILD'S SKIN."
1,I'VE YET TO FIND A TOILET IT FITS ON!,"The only thing about this seat that is good is the fact that it folds up. I'm training two kids now and neither one will use it. It does help protect some, but it does not come close to covering any seat that we have tried it on and my kids still touch the toilet seat."
3,mom of a Ethan,"This was a nice idea, but been having problems with it. First it slips off toilets seats that are elongated and not round, second when my son moves or squirms around alot on the potty this would tend to fall into the toilet. I end up having to lean over and hold down the back ends while he uses it. It has not been a great product for traveling as I thought and I would recommend a regular soft potty seat to travel with."
1,careful,"I Bought this product for my 3yr. old. At first I thought it would help her go to the bathroom when we went out but when she sits on the seat she has been pinched a few times. At first she didn't want to sit on it again & she cried when I took her to the bathroom, but I told her I would sit her on it & I would lift her off. Since I have been doing this she hasn't been pinched, but it took me a while for her to trust me. If you buy this product you have to be very careful or your child will get pinched."
1,Total garbage,"This potty seat arrived the other day and we returned it before even trying it with our 2-year-old daughter. It feels very flimsy, like there's no way it would hold her up, and her skin could easily get pinched in the ""no-pinch"" hinges. Even placing it all the way forward as instructed, it didn't fit our oblong toilet seat. It came without the promised storage bag. No handles, so there's nothing to hold on to besides the dirty toilet. Not worth the $[...], even with free shipping."
3,"OK, for the price","For $10 I thought this would be worth trying. It's ... all right. Mine is clearly a return -- bag was scotch-taped together and there was no storage bag in the package. ""Round"" is a strange design choice, given how common oval toilet seats are. With the foam pads, though, I can make it steady enough on the seat for the purpose. Not crazy about those, since it makes disinfecting more difficult. But, the seat is better than absolutely nothing."
4,"Good price, good little seat.","I was a little worried about pinching after reading reviews, but I ALSO read the reviews about how to use it and that helped so much. It works like a charm. I like having it because DD's little bum would just fall into the bowl w/o it. I bring it aling everywhere so we don't have to worry about if someone has a potty seat or not."
2,good idea but pinches,"Pinched my daughter's tush (even though it was opened all the way, it bent as she was getting on). She never went near it again. Have to be very careful as child is sitting down."
5,"Compact, easy, safe!","I was worried about the pinching possibility - but this must be a new design, the flaps lay over each other and there i s no chance of pinching. Works really well for my tiny girl (she is 1yo and 18 lbs) and takes up very little space in my bag. Sweet!"
2,too flimsy,"I was hoping for something lightweight and easy to carry for potty training purposes. I definitely got what I asked for, but I didn't ask to get my daughter's butt cheeks to get pinched in the process! Aside from this seat being flimsy, the package was missing the ""travel bag"" it was supposed to come with. Needless to say, I returned it and got the padded travel potty seat instead. It's a little bulkier to have to lug around, but my little girl is so much more comfortable!"
1,Does not fit toilet seats,"We got this potty seat for traveling and it did not fit in any of the hotel, restrooms pottys. It seems that it is ROUND and the seats on toilets are OVAL. Look for a different seat - I see some that are OVAL in shape."
3,"Helpful, but not perfect","I bought this potty for traveling. It worked great on airplanes, but you really have to make sure it is open fully before you put your child on. I had the unfortunate experience of it pinching in an airplane bathroom. You can imagine the result. The potty also isn't the best for public toilets, because they have long and wide bowls and this potty isn't that stable on them. I used it when I needed to, but my child didn't enjoy the process."
2,More political than focused on invironmental policy,"I used this book as a resource on a Global Warming paper I was doing in college. While some of the information in the book is useful, most of the book is a transparent attempt by a couple of democrats to bash the oppositions leader. The authors often abondon intellect and quality prose for childish and mean spirited cheap shots at the Bush administration. I don't agree with Bush's environmental policies either but authors of a book should be more careful about how they let their emotions play out."
1,Strategic ignorance of strategic ignorance?,"This otherwise excellent account of George W. Bush's appalling environmental record (strategically?) ignores, and thereby condones, the President's three most deadly anti-environment policies: never-ending mass immigration, nearly open borders, and countless stealth attempts to reengineer more amnesties. These policies are fueling a US population explosion that is outstripping that of many Third World nations. Bush and Pope (and his Sierra Club) are something like the dazed South Asian islanders seen wading out into the sudden eerie low tide, oblivious to that high distant foaming crest, a tsunami, making its way, making its way."
1,No work,"this item was no working,no hardware to install and i dont find eny help online too! maybe this item was damage!"
3,A little disappointed,"I have bought a couple of similar cookie pans or baking sheets at Target in the past that were extra heavy duty and better quality than this one. The last one I bought was defective, had bubbles in the nonstick that broke through. This pan is not near as good and cost more but apparently Wilton has stopped making the other one - so this is as close as I could find. I would probably love this one had I not had the other one first. This one almost does not fit into my oven because it is an inch longer. I have only used this one once. Hope it holds up well."
4,The Fallen,"Just started on this author. I like the teen books as weird/strange happenings. I liked this book The Fallen a lot. Disappointed I couldn't get book number 4 ""Reckoning"" until July and the new book has The Fallen & Reckoning together as one."
3,The Fallen,"This novel is a must-read for any angel fans.I assume that this is probably the first in a series which is why it took a while in the story to get the origin aspects out of the way.Though the writing was slow on some aspects, the plot became very interesting very quickly.While the premise is a tad cliched for any genre fan (young person fines out that he is the chosen one), the author does an excellent job in exploring the mythology and the world of angels. I found myself finishing this book in a little over a day.Sniegoski does an excellent job in the characterization (to the point that I can almost forgive him for the big dumb talking dog)I am quite curious to see where the story goes in the books to follow and am quite curious to see what fate is bestowed upon young Aaron Corbet."
2,A little Misleading,"Good book, but a little misleading. The book describes that sufism can be practiced in any religion besides Islam. Maybe there could be something similar, but definately not under the name of sufism, which is the heart of the Islamic faith."
2,daughter of fire,"I read the book...I understand that the author did not have any informations in the beginning as what the Sufi system was. But this diary was written for the author not the reader.In order to write a book for the outside world ( was it?),more informations about the Sufi system should have been given, even if not in details as I agree...some privacy should be onored. BUTIt seems to me that the book is a countinuous lament about the pain the author felt during her training.Yes pain IS part of the process but the again continuous'repetition' of words and facts are useless and almost annoying.Finally part 2 is much better."
3,36 songs...omigosh! This is a pretty cute CD!,"Yo peoples! This CD has 36 songs, 3 on-air versions, 2 with words. To tell you the best ones, they are song #1, 3, 8, 10, 11, 18, 20, 29, 33, and 35! yay yay! Me luv anime music! I'm a colllector!!!!!!!!!!! Buy it, it really is pretty cute! I luv #1!"
2,Another Denning Disappointment,"Once again Troy Denning shows us that he can take a great campaign setting and utterly destroy it. ... the first half was great, a very good adventrue type novel. Then he gets trapped in the mazes which turns into some symbolic crap about pain and suffering. When I want symbolism i'll read a great classic, but I didn't want symbolism I just wanted a good fantasy book, which in this case did not deliver.Also, Denning still does not know how to write something in the first person point of view. At times it seems like the book is simply narriated, but then it turns into the Lady of Pains specific observances as to what is going on around the hero. The same thing was attempted with Crucible: Trail of Cyric the Mad and failed just like this book."
1,Possibly the Greatest Headache Inducing Piece of Tripe Ever,"Its all in the title; the real 'pain' was actually reading the dreaded item.Do not misinterpret me, for I am usually a fan of Denning's work (especially the Twilight Giants Trilogy) but there is no excuse for mentally torturing his readers as if he were some creative sadist wreaking havoc with the literate populace at large."
3,Half good.,"Precisely that. The first half is good. The second half, whilst in the maze, is bad. I got so sick of the pointless wandering about that I skipped ahead to the ending. The prose is pretty good, but there is little sentence variety. The sentences didn't all have to be so long! Reminds me of those run-on sentences from the eighteenth century...And the hero? The first time I saw the summary, I thought it was the PS:T novelization with a different plot. As for his companions....after the first few sentences in which you meet them, they promptly lose all personality. They could have all been killed and I doubt the plot would have been affected much.Final verdict: Don't buy this book. Borrow it, just for that first good half."
3,"Starts great, but then gets bogged down","Pages of Pain is a wonderful book at first. The city of Sigil is described beautifully and all of its inhabitants react to the main character interestingly. The main character himself is a pompous paladin who also is well-developed. The problem comes just before the half-way point of the book when the hero is thrown into a maze. This is itself not a problem and is consistant with the Planescape setting. The problem is that the hero spends the entire rest of the book just wandering around hunting the 'maze monster.' The previous depth and complexity of the story is all but abandoned. Sure, there are a few interesting tidbits left in the characters, but the last half of the book is disappointing."
2,Could have been better,The ambiance in Sigil was described with great details but the story spirals toward a dead-end when the characters enter the mazes. I also didn't like the Lady of Pain character. Reading her toughts just make her loose some of her mystery. Good storyline tought.
4,good for planars and primes alike.,"I was surprised by how well the book was written, especially when written from the Lady of Pain's perspective. My one complaint is that he didn't quite get the mood and the speech of Planescape as well as I'd have liked. I suppose I've played too much Planescape: Torment, which would make anything seem inferior. Other than that, I was thoroughly pleased with this book, and I would recommend it to both those who already know the setting and those who don't."
2,Mind numbing,"I was so excited that a novel in the Planescape setting finally arrived (I read this book years ago)... and so incredibly disappointed with the story. This book is just plain boring. About a third of the way through it began to test my willpower; the only reason I finished was for closure. The characters never really develop, there's a very weak attempt at a romantic plot, and the prose is flat out boring. I've never read any Troy Denning books before this one, and now I specifically avoid them."
2,Demming's plus positive thinking,"Quint Studer put together a book that contains affair amount of useful advice to people working in management positions in the healthcare industry. Among his practical tips are the ""AIDET"" acronym and the policy to call hospital patients a few days after their discharge. To call this collection of common sense suggestions a ""philosophy"" seems to be a stretch. This compendium is, in essence, an amalgam of Demming's insights -- put the customer, including the ""internal customer"", first -- and a big dose of relentless positive thinking. Add to this a generous sprinkling of adulatory feedback, which reads like the comments of satisfied customers on early morning TV infomercials, and you have an end product that I found difficult to read cover to cover."
4,Before HCAHPS Studer still did great work,"Although it's a little bit dated and his other book The HCAHPS Handbook is more up to date with patient satisfaction, this bool has a lot to offer."
4,Book,Was recently able to go to a Studor group seminar. Am thoroughly enjoying the book. Very easy to read.
5,How to create excellence,I worked in one of the hospitals mentioned in Quint's book. His pillar principles work. They don't have to apply to just healthcare. Any service industry can benefit tremendously from the Studer philosophy!
1,stop preaching,"This book should have had some kind of mark or label alerting me to the fact that there is preaching on every page. I wanted a mystery -- I got endless sermons. I know plenty of people who live real christian values, and they don't go about talking endlessly about Jesus. The ""romance"" was really contrived, with adult people pretending there are reasons for them not to date (I couldn't find any explanation), so that Ruby could agonize on every page about how much Wesley turns her on but ""alas no! I must guard against temptation!"". Like a bad Victorian gothic. The mystery got lost in all this."
2,"Weights are o.k., case is not.","Weights are average - they'll do the job. But I was very disappointed with the case, and that was the reason I selected this. Case does not close properly, so it defeats the purpose of having the case. Certainly doesn't secure the weights for transport."
4,Lovely weights; flimsy case.,"I suppose I was lucky as everything arrived in tact. The carrying case is definitely way too flimsy it you're going to use it to carry the weights about. I simply keep the weights under my bed and slide the box out when I want to use them; so, for my purposes it does the job fine.The weights themselves are very nice with a comfortable grip and decently priced. Overall, I would recommend these if you want a nice set of weights, but definitely don't get this over something else simply because of the case."
3,Hand Weight Set,"These weights came in a nice case, the only problem was that one of the latches is broken so it doesn't stay shut when I try to carry it! Bummer! I like the weights-easy to grip/hang on to, even when your hands get all sweaty!"
3,Packaging problems,"I was very disappointed when I opened the box. The case for the weights didn't close properly. The shipping company put something around the box to keep it closed but that must have been after the case came open. I saw a couple of reviews that referred to the problems with the case. I'm just starting out so the weights seem like a perfect beginning for me. I'm not happy that the case doesn't close and that my weights look dirty and ""used"" instead of new."
3,Ok item,"The item arrived cracked. I shipped it back, and they did not have any other in stock. So I got a refund. If it was not crack, I'm sure my girl friend would have loved it."
4,Grandson Loves - but cord has come loose,"My grandson (age 2-3/4) is a total Thomas fan and especially loves the cranes. This was a recent purchase and he was so excited that he got up by himself in the morning and his dad heard him playing with it before anyone was up.He has had it less than 2 weeks and the cord that allows the magnet to go up and down has come loose from the insides and we have had to just tie it on (no longer goes up and down). We're about to take the crane apart (there are obvious Phillips head screws) and hope we can re-tie the cord.This is the first of many Thomas series that has had a problem, but since it's quite a bit more expensive than trains, I hope we can fix it. I also plan to to to Learning Center's web site and see if there is a Customer Help area for advice.SusanD in Northern CA"
5,Superb quality,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality in these pans.Both are incredibly thick and heavy and it really drives the message home that Calphalon made an effort to create quality for significantly less money than it's competitor, All-Clad namely.I would recommend these pans to anyone however please realize that these pans are small as are Tapas in Spain. Do not expect to make a 3 person meal in these pans unless you are feeding a family of Little People.They are ideal for appetizer sized portions and double as beautiful serving dishes."
4,"Great pans, but smaller than advertised","The only drawback to these pans is that they are smaller than advertised. They aren't roughly 6x9 oval pans; they're 6"" round pans. When I first looked at their description I would have passed on them if I had known their true size. But I didn't return them because they look great and they do seem to be good quality."
5,These little pans are a big deal!,"Perfect size for an individual portion. Non-stick pans are very bad for you. Non-stick pans kill pet birds and they'll kill you too, it just takes longer. Over time the non-stick coating comes off in your food, little by little, and you eat it. Not so with these little pans. Everyone in my family eats something different so individual serving pans are a must. Easy clean up too. I hand wash mine. Should last forever!"
5,A Very Creamy Lipstick!,This is one of my most favorite lipsticks. It is extremely creamy and looks very sexy on the lips. This is my favorite color.
5,Loves the fire station,Trains & Fire Stations. It does not get much better than that for my 2 year old. He spends hours playing with it. He studies the way it works. He could not be happier.
3,It covers all the basics...,"This book covers all the basics, but it doesn't go deep enough into the theory nor applications...The problem is, this specific series of books covers 2 books, crunched up in the space of one... usually CIRCUITS is a separate textbook and Electronic Devices is a different textbook ..... but here Floyd squashed it into one book...He even has separate series of textbooks.. where CIRCUITS and ELECTRONIC DEVICES are separate.... i suggest u buy the two separate ones... instead this condensed package.... those two are really good"
5,Excelent fundamental intro,"This book is an excelent introduction to electric circuits and some electronics. It presents everything in a very simple and comprehensive way. So if you are initiating in this fiel this book is for you. If you have readed the review below, let me say that there is no problem with these book, because the reality is that electrons move from negative to positive terminals. And because electrons make current you can think of current moving to positive side, or you can think reversely (like the convention) this doesn't matter, this doesn't change the analysis."
5,Very good for a thorough and easy explanation of components,"Floyd does an excellent job of explaining the fundamentals of electronics with numerous examples and ""slow motion"" explanations of exactly how components such as capacitors and inductors work alone as well as together. He does not devote much time to solid state devices besides rectifiers, I suspect there's another book for that. I purchased a used version for only a few dollars, it's a good reference to have."
1,Beware the current flow. . . .,"This book uses the actual flow of electrons to depict current (minus to positive), as opposed to the conventional view that current flows from a positive terminal to the negative terminal. This proved to be the books undoing.I could not find justification for this current model in the description, the table of contents, or the forward of the book. I was extremely disappointed."
4,Safeway Store Cutout,"I happened on ""Lethal Gas"" thirty-five years ago on a Safeway Store cutout shelf. The book's next step was to have its cover torn off and tossed in the waste bin, and what a waste that would have been... and what a break for me. I have told the story of the extraordinary prison work crew, who tore down the wall and moved it closer to the street, a thousand times... to anyone, who would care to listen. Its how I find out if people ""get it."" This was where I first learned of desktop football, and the Latin for ""Play Ball."""
3,Prison Satire,"Very funny book. It led to me getting in some minor trouble in school as I became the ""Phantom"" of my high school."
2,"Good Quality, Sizing and RMA Sucks.","Good Quality, Sizing and RMA Sucks. I bought the exact same size I wear in every other pair of pants I have bought. I received these and they seem to be a couple sizes too small. I completed the Amazon RMA form online and have waited for the vendor to provide an RMA, but have been trying to get one for a week now. The vendor says that I can return / exchange at a retail store, but their retail stores don't seem to carry sizes for people like me - hence why I made the purchase online."
2,Very Good Quality But...,they were sized too small in the waist and they needed to be hemmed. I don't recall the ad stating that they had to be hemmed. So I returned them
5,Awesome,This is one fun bridge. Does take up more room since there are lots of options for track designs. Kids and parents love it!
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Consciousness experiments.Altered States is a medical horror novel of sorts, as a man experiments with investigating consciousness by means of hallucinogenic type drugs and what is basically a sensory deprivation tank.Being a bit of a horror story, all doesn't go as planned.Certainly a rather whacky group of scientists with all the drugs floating around in the book."
4,"Used songs, but good as new.","Tom Waits is just one of those guys that's beyond description or comparison. This is a collection of some of his 70's work, apparently before he got weird, which is funny because alot of this is pretty wild stuff itself. Some tracks like ""Step Right Up"" sound like an auctioneer gone nuts, and others like ""Jersey Girl"" are really quite moving and pretty. A unique artist and voice indeed. These songs often paint a picture for me, and it's of a guy who has a cigarette in one hand and a whiskey in the other, singing in a smokey jazz/beat club, the one down the alley in the old part of town that mostly just the locals end up in, and if you stumble in the door, you leave having had one of those memorable nights that you only get a few of in your lifetime."
4,Not bad overview,"There are some who wish that Tom Waits would go back to the kind of music he was doing prior to SWORDFISHTROMBONES, but I can't honestly say I'm one of them. Much as I liked his Seventies-era albums, he really was in great danger of falling into a shtick and becoming a one-note novelty. But the only track on this best-of where the novelty wears thin is ""Christmas Card From a Hooker in Minneapolis""......otherwise, this is a good collection of the pre-weird Waits who primarily wrote either sodden ballads or jazzy hipster-scats. I don't think the former is as well-represented (Where's ""Shiver Me Timbers?"" Or ""On The Nickel,"" ""Ruby's Arms"" and ""Martha?""), but if this whets your appetite to find out more about Tom Waits the songster and get the albums this package is culled from, so much the better."
3,Bah; humbug.,"I hate to be the sort of smarmy [person] who does the 'buy the original albums' schtick, but really: this is just too much. I will grant you: most of Waits' earlier albums are not wholly consistent; a good best-of (possibly two discs) jobbie would not come amiss. But what's this? Eh? Eh? Who the (...) wants to listen to 'I Never Talk to Strangers,' or 'A Sight for Sore Eyes' (which became a lot better when he reworked the tune for 'In the Neighborhood) or even 'Step Right Up,' (which is amusing for awhile but isn't exactly an enduring classic). Let's not mess around: any collection of early Waits that omits 'Romeo is Bleeding,' 'Invitation to the Blues,' or 'Kentucky Avenue' is a joke. So there! If you want to get into this material, go with Blue Valentine."
5,all time hero,"Now that Alice and Blood Money are on the verge of being released - and how magnificently wonderful both of them are with my personal preference going to the ferocious imprecation against the filth of the world of Blood Money - is a precious opportunity to recap on Tom Waits previous work. And it is quite interesting to notice that, even as the form or the attitude towards his songwriting may be changing, Waits subtle ""deformation"" of ""american songwriting"" stereotypes has always been there as his individual trademark. And how wondrows he has always been. ""Used Songs"" they really are in the way all of American History, Literature and Popular Music seem to pervade them through the very peculiar perspective of their writer."
3,Poor selections on this second attempt,"Asylum has tried before to put out a 1973-1980 Tom Waits retrospective, and they blow it this time. My complaints are, of course, with the track selection, which seems almost random.Uh... where are the most popular, famous tracks from this period? ""The Piano Has Been Drinking?"" ""I Hope I Don't Fall in Love With You?"" ""Romeo Is Bleeding?"" I mean, come on... most of these other songs are just plain weak.Get Small Change, Closing Time, and the Heart of Saturday Night instead. It'll be worth the added expense if you're definitely into him."
3,Lonely Planet Puerto Rico-for pre trip only,This Lonely PLanet Puerto Rico Book has some information in it that will be helpful to a first timer.....but I would not try to use it as a guide once you arrive. I was expecting to use the maps included in this book and they were absolutley out of date....and did not include many important roads and routes on it's maps. This is my biggest complaint about it..because I bought it thinking it was a good all around hand book especially for the maps and it just plain wasn't. It did however offer insights to general travel issues like what to see or local info....and I must admit that Puerto Rico grows as we read this.and maybe it out grew this book ..but...still... I must ask...how does Lonely Planet expect us to find these things they mention without good and up to date maps to go along ?????
2,Disappointing!,"We bought this book on the basis of the recommendations we found here. But we didn't find it to be very up-to-date, Much of the information has changed, and the author makes strange comments about Vieques (""only a fool or a developer would want the military to leave""). All in all, we found this guide to be a disappointment. It does not have the quality of information we expect from Lonely Planet. We used several other guides and found a new guide, Explore Puerto Rico by Harry S. Pariser, to be much more accurate and with a great environmental slant."
3,Lonely Planet Puerto Rico,"This book is out-dated, because some restaurants in the book don't exist any more."
3,Great starter book but lots of info out of date,This is a great book for an overview but many details are not valid any more. I would not rely on this book as your only source of info. Do your homework online .
3,A Little Outdated,"I trust Lonely Planet, and it's pretty much the only travel guide I use. However, this one is a little outdated. The newest guide for Puerto Rico is out now, but wasn't available at the time when I went to Puerto Rico. I made all my reservations based on their recommendations, and I was not thrilled w/ the results. Casa Cabuy in El Yunque was the only recommendation that really shined, every other place was funky and expensive. Maybe the newest one is better."
3,Puerto Rico guide,"It gives all the basic information, I was expecting more ""on-the-shoe-string"" information (that's why I bought it)."
4,This was useful,"These guides are never completely correct and several places listed in this guide have already closed. However, it was still a good way to figure out what we wanted to do while in Puerto Rico even if it was not as accurate and up to date at Lonely Planet guidebooks often are."
2,need a update,This Puerto Rico Lonely planet need an update.We had some problems with this book because the hotel prices are changed and hotels/Ferries were closed and changed.
4,AMAZING,This is a book that was a required text for one of my Lit. Crit. classes. I sold it back at the end of the semester and have had to borrow my prof's copy about 4 times this semester for papers for other classes. It is really helpful for writing any English paper (even for non-critical papers). I am excited to see it again and here it is the same price as a used copy at school.
2,A handbook of critical approaches to literature,I looked for the 5th edition of this book and found it on Amazon. I ordered the product and received the 3rd edition. My professor specifically wanted the 5th edition for its content. Now I must share with another student. Amazon sucks!
1,this movie sucks (worst horror remake ever),This is without a doubt the worst horror remake ever made. I saw this film in theaters opening day and i have regret'd it ever since. it's one of the only few horror movies i just wanted to end so the pain would be overdo not buy this movieand yes it's worse than the prom night remake
2,Lifetime Presents The Stepfather,"Horror remakes never live up the original and The Stepfather is no different. Dylan Walsh takes over for Terry O' Quinn and does a decent job. Although his acting is like anything you'd see on a Lifetime Movie or cable drama series, which I know he comes from. The story is the same, and it does a decent job. I think the movie dragged on a bit but it wasn't the worst remake out there. Enjoyable if have an open mind and watch it for entertainment."
1,The Stepfather,"There was nothing special about this movie. I believe that it was a remake, they could have done much better with the material."
2,Just not like the original,"Another example of a remake gone awry. The 1987 version is a classic...this one is predictable and a little corny...too many unbelievable scenes where terrified victims never call the police and never talk. This one is splintered and shallow. However, if you haven't seen the original, this one is quite entertaining. Only two stars because I saw the original."
2,"Now, they're just messing with us!","The review on the cover promises a great story, but instead we are fed lame good looking people, who don't miss a chance to take off their clothes while trying to figure out the PUZZLE! It ends as poorly as it starts, but it's yours to explore. I still have no idea what Sela Ward is doing in this movie; I guess every mountain has a valley!"
2,I didn't like it...,"Ok...I'll get to the point. I loved the original. It was funny. It was bloody. You actually believed that the ""Stepfather"" was crazy. He was so crazy that he believed his own lies. This version is just boring. In the end, I just felt like..Ok, so what? There was nothing shocking, or gory, or funny, or interesting, or entertaining about this movie. Why can't anyone come up with some original ideas? I would advise anyone who is thinking about watching this movie, to just skip it, and see the original."
2,Why was this remade...,"I completely agree with the other reviewers points, how there is nothing new to be brought to the table. And the PG-13 ruined it. The first was Brutal. This was clearly made for the CW channel.Obviously the idea of the film was to remake a great film, ruin it, throw in some tight bod teen actors in swimsuits, cast the idiot from Nip Tuck as the stepfather, and make me fall asleep until the last 10 minutes. They accomplished EVERYTHING as above.Im not going into detail with the film, as many others already have. But just take the word of anyone who didnt rate this higher than 3 stars. Save your cash and buy the original for your collection."
2,Does Anyone Over 30 See Something Familiar?,"This movie is a mixture of ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" and ""Single White Female"". The gender of the villian is different, that's all. Let's see...(A) A person with a mysterious past takes on a life with a new family. (B) Friends and loved ones begin to become suspicious and even start to hear conversations through air vents. (C) Friends and loved ones start to disappear. (D) Climatic ending. I did not feel much originality with this story line. I'm surprised that copyright laws were not violated."
3,How Do You Top Terry O' Quinn!!,"I'm a fan of the original Stepfather films starring Terry O' Quinn, and I have to say watching the new Stepfather doesn't quite come off as good as the original. I mean how do you top Terry O' Quinns performance in the original. In the original Stepfather he was almost convincing as if the character he played was himself in real life, that's how indebt his performance was. I mean I liked it in a 3 star way, but to get a 5 star the main character himself would have had to top Terry's performance, and I don't think he did that at all....then again, that's just my opinon"
5,Secure Mailbox,This is a well built and secure mailbox. Mail thieves will not be able to get anything out of this unit.
3,Good for reading generic codes only,"Another reviewer said the dealer found 8 DTC codes but the CodeScout only showed 2. The MFR's website description (http://www.autoxray.com/product_detail.php?pid=92) says the CodeScout (only) reads and displays generic DTCs (not manufacturer specific DTC's). It will however erase both generic and manufacturer specific DTC's. So if you want to read custom DTC's for you make/model, you'll need the AutoXray 1500 instead of the 700 (and pay 2x the price)."
1,Discontinued Product--P CODES ONLY FOR PRE-2004 VEHICLES ONLY,"I ordered the AutoXray 700 as a Goldbox deal. Only when I inserted the CD that came with the unit did I discover that the CD does not have codes for vehicles manufactured later than 2003.The AutoXray 700 CodeScout is a DISCONTINUED PRODUCT and does NOT have manufacturer support for updating the code list in the manual for vehicles newer than 2003.The only way to access codes is through the AutoXray website, which means you must have an Internet connection and computer available when you are working on the vehicle.When I contacted customer support I was told that this unit ONLY READS ""P"" codes. It does not read B, C or U codes.Further, the unit does NOT READ manufacturer specific codes--only the SAE codes****Nowhere on the Amazon website, on the packaging, or in the user manual does it say that the unit ONLY READS SAE P codes.****The product is being returned to Amazon as mislabeled and misleading."
4,Mechanic at home,Bought this for my husband. He is very happy with it tha is why I rated it with four stars.
5,AutoXray AX700 OBD-II Scanner,"I would recommend this product to anyone with a check engine light problem, you can find out what is wrong and also clear the codes once you're finished with the repairs.It is amazing what I have been told was wrong with my car only to find out that was not the caseCould not get the included DVD to load the program, but was able to go online for the current software, you can also obtain codes on line as well on their web site."
2,Sent it back,"Over the years I have purchased many dozens of electronic and mechanical items from Amazon and this is only the third time that I have used their excellent return process. I can see this product being fairly rated with four stars if you own a vehicle between 1996 and 2006, use windows 98/XP operating system, and got the daily deal price that I did. But even at the daily deal price, it was just too lacking in features and had severely outdated and crappy software. I opted to return it and look for a deal on a better unit."
4,Great tool,"I had an intermittent ""service engine soon"" light that was driving me nuts. At a $100 for a diagnostic check from the dealer to tell me I needed an oxygen sensor the cost of this tool was more than worth it and I could save more by doing the fix myself. I saved 50% on the diagnostic test alone."
2,Final Round,"I am a big fan of William Bernhardt, but this book was a major disappointment. The dialogue was too glib and thestory was just plain silly. This book was a waste of my time.He can do better!"
3,unsatisfying,"My overall impression is that this book was dashed off in a big hurry. The plot and characters are unconvincing --just sketches. the solution to the mystery did not seem credible to me. and the hero was so obnoxious in the first 50 pages that his shift in attitude was itself not very believable. Maybe it's one of those ""girl"" things, but i am not enamored of characters who seem to think their mission in life is to alienate the maximum number of people by boorish behavior. Nevertheless it was a pleasant afternoon read, and i think would have been more if the author had put more effort into it."
1,Avoid This Book!!,"Author Bernhardt is one of my favorite writers when he is writing legal thrillers. In this novel, however, he is out of his millieu. The ""hero"" is a golfer/crime-solver. This character and others in the book are irritating. Bernhardt is no humorist and his attempts at humor are pathetic. This novel is so sophmoric that it is difficult to believe that the same man wrote this book AND his many other novels that I admire. Please, Mr Bernhardt, stick to what you're good at. This book is a disaster in so many ways that that this limited space is insufficient to innumerate."
1,DOUBLE BOGEY AT BEST,"Final Rounds was my first mystery in years. Being a golf addict, I was hoping this book could keep my interest. Final Rounds is a very easy read and the characters are clearly defined. Regretfully, Mr. Bernhardt resorted to old cliches with very little originality. The concept of the book is great. The lead character, Mr. Cross is predictable and its a real shame especially with his personality (big shot golfer, lots of talent, ladies man and etc.). The ending is totally unpredictable and had nothing to really do with the story. It's almost as if the last 60 pages were quickly written to end the nightmare. I really expected so much more and was very disappointed. The fact that I finished the more is more of an accomplishment than this literary work. Better luck next time!"
1,the publishers should be ashamed of themselves,"This is probably the worst book ever written. Obviously Mr. Bernhardt knows nothing about golf and Ballatine Books should never have published it. Now I know why it was only $1 at our library sale. It is a 'tee box' not a 'tee off', people 'play golf' not 'golf' and who would even think that a 9 iron would be an alternate club to a driver? Augusta should sue for defamation of character. Aside from the golf gaffs, the plot was perdictable and stupid. Do even ask about the dialogue. Don't waste your time."
1,If you're a golfer -- stay away from this book!,"Let me make this quick. I really like Ben Kincaid and have no intention of discontinuing buying and reading Mr. Bernhardt's books. However, I wish I had read the reviews posted on Amazon before picking this book off the bargain table at a not-to-be-disclosed local bookseller. It was below average as mystery and just plain awful as a golf story. STAY AWAY!"
3,Great device with a bug...,"The time when I got this phone I was really happy with it. The phone was all I wanted it to be... It works great, good batery life, great fitures...But hey! wait before you buy this phone..I used this phone for a couple of days it worked great and one day while going to work I decided to use the handsfree while talking to a friend of mine. The moment I get plug the headsets the call gets droped.First I thought I pressed a key on mistake, I try it again.I reliased, its not me its the phone..I called Amazon and kept them informed about it and they were quick in replacing the phone. I got my new phone and it has tghe same problem, it does not work either.Its basicaly a bug with 7130c, it does not work with a headset.So I recomend people who use the handsfree on regular basis, to be careful, other than that its a cool device.Nash"
3,For a Beginner,"This book will really help you out if you haven't even played a note on it before. Within a few months, it will probably be time to buy the second Essential Elements book."
3,Violin Practice Book,"I have the book and accompling CD. By itself the book and accompling CD are excellent. However, the CD does not have any counts before any selection which makes it difficult to corrodinate between getting your insturment ready to play and the beginning measure of any piece. Getting beyond that I rate this book excellent as well as the CD. but as a companion between the two, I rate the two as so so."
3,Outdated,This is the old version of the book series. I recommend the Essential Elements 2000 that is most commonly used by orchestras at school.
4,on time,"very descriptive, but this was for my grandchild and 6 years old is way to young to start on violin."
5,Thorough,"Great DVD, but I have to sat the Title ""Ultimate Israeli Instinctive Shooting and Combat Pistol Training DVD"" is better. This does have some stuff in it the other does not, like arrests and searches. It seems like they where filmed in similar locations. A good DVD and you get it if buy the LOTAR Collection. Overall I recommend it."
2,Very mediocre,If you're a SEALs or Special Forces fanatic like me you'll read this no matter what any review says just because you're so desperate to clue into these guys' stories. I've read just about every personal account I can get my hand on and eventually found my way to this one. It's really not very good if you're interested in Vietnam action. One whole section is devoted to stories about skydiving. One chapter is an interview with Rudy Boesch's wife about her experience skydiving? Still want to read? Because there is so little battle stories I found the chapters on SDV operation the most interesting. All in all a very mediocre book. Read this one if you're really as desperate as I am for every word you can find about these guys.
3,"Overall pretty good, but some parts could have been avoided.","I know that with 3 stars I am being a little too harsh, but there were sections of this book that I didn't care for at all. On the other hand, the book provides an insight into the daily lifes of NAVY SEALS,and not everything they do is exciting and fun."
1,"Bad, bad, and bad",Should have stop reading after the first five books. I think the author just wrote the extra three books for money. The book is just full of stupid dialogue. No characters development. Everyone is so one dimensional. Problem solves faster than I can flip the page. I will be real careful from now on buying this author book.
4,Beautiful cinematography with uncommon / interesting surf locations,"I purchased a digital download of this surf video for my new Kindle Fire. The cinematography, music, use of color, and scenery are wonderful. They feature uncommon and interesting surf locations, and a cast of top notch surfers. The surfing was awesome and the style of the movie is very similar to Sipping Jet Streams. The movie starts off a little slow but picks up after about 5 or so minutes. Definitely worth buying; perhaps it will also make you think about trying out some of the featured locations."
5,The Halloween Bible!!!,"If there is a book you must own about halloween............THIS IS IT. Do not hesitate. This book will become the definitive ""bible"" about antique halloween decorations. Stunning photography of a top notch collection with history and facts that are entertaining and informative. Even if you have never looked at antique halloween decorations, you will want this book. Other books have been written in the past by authors with inaccurate information and lousy pictures who just want to be in print. Mr Ledenbach truly put his heart and soul in this book to ensure quality, accuracy and that the smallest detail is correct. RUN, DO NOT WALK TO BUY THIS WONDERFUL BOOK!!"
5,Top Vintage Halloween Guide,"When I started discovering vintage Halloween items, I came upon Mark Ledenbach's book. It became my leading guide while investigating on eBay. On his web site I could contact him an ask for advice. He was very friendly and helpful. The photos and lay out of his book are fantastic and it is better organized then other books I own. I could not have enjoyed the beautiful graphics and usual, rare items if it were not for this book. You must purchase this whether you are a serious collector or not. Have fun!"
5,Eye Candy for the Collector,"So far this is the best book I've found on Vintage Halloween in the sense of information, layout and the broad spectrum of items covered. It is evident that Mark Ledenbach is truly passionate about his collection. The photos are high quality and well laid out. The information is thought provoking and facsinating to any Halloween enthusiast. I do wish there were more item information regarding usage or other interesting tidbits, however this book does give the reader what it promises.A must have for the Halloween aficionado."
5,Creative ideas from a master,"I have had this book since it was published, and dog-earred many of the pages. Her creative exercises are invaluable for the artist who wants to push beyond the ordinary, and explore new ways of designing a painting. I use it when I teach watercolor classes, and most of my students end up going out and buying it themselves. Truly a book worth owning. I had the thrill of a lifetime when I took Betsy Dillard Stroud's workshop recently, and I told her how much the projects in this book have sparked my creativity. Get this book, read it, and try some Betsy's amazing techniques. Now that spring/summer is almost upon us, you'll be able to try some of her ""outside"" techniques of pouring/spraying,etc. This is an amazing book from a very talented & awe-inspiring artist. Not to be missed!"
1,Do not waste your money,"I went through my kitchen and replaced just about all my dinner ware and serving ware with Sango Nova Blue ware. It was quiet pretty and looked terrific when serving different dishes. The blues really made the food pop visually. Unfortunately, within a year, just about all of the dish ware was destroyed. I do not have a dishwasher, so everything is hand washed, but that should not make any difference anyway. Everything was developing micro cracks within months leaving me with chips on just about everything. When the dishes started falling apart (and I do mean that they would fall apart just sitting in the cabinet, just holding them when washing, or even while serving dinner) I had had enough. I threw at all away and replaced everything. While it looks pretty, this stuff is truly junk."
2,"uneven, chipped after a short time","These are certainly serviceable plates that look good and have a good price. But they don't last. I've only had them for a few months and one has already chipped. Compare this with my fiestaware plates that I used previously - they've lasted 7+ years without a chip!These plates are also uneven on the bottom, so there's lots of annoying clattering while everyone is sitting down to eat, from the motion of poking around at your food, cutting with your knife, etc.I would spend a little more on something that will last longer without breaking."
4,Hip to be square,I like these square salad plates and only wish they'd make a square dinner sized plate!
5,very pleased,The product came extremely quickly!!! It was supposed to take six weeks and it came in just over a week. I love the book. I love the monologues. I highly recommend it! Thank you!
2,NOT METAL,"The parts at the top and bottom which look like brushed stainless steel are actually plastic! There are unattractive seams on the ""chrome"" parts consistent with plastic put in molds. It's deceptive of them not to mention the materials, and I was disappointed with this purchase. They feel cheap and light compared to pricier brands like Peugeot. Brand new out of the box, the fake metal parts already look chipped and irregular around the seams."
5,Very well constructed and stylish,"We are very happy with this product, beware, they are a little too big and actually are loaded with salt and pepper, not like I think that is something safe"
4,Holding up,"I got a salt and pepper shaker previously that began to fall apart quickly. This set works well, and still looks good after several months of use. My one complaint would be that the inner wells don't hold that much salt and pepper, and need to be frequently refilled."
5,ACME Replacement Foot Ring for Model 6001,"21st Century Kitchens has gone above and beyond, they contacted the manufacturer and replaced the Foot Ring at no charge to me, I am very grateful for the extra mile they made to make me a VERY satisfied customer, you can trust that 21st Century Kitchen will make you a happy customer. Please see the photo I posted of the replacement part.My comments from before the ring was replaced:This replacement foot ring for the Acme 6001 is black and from a broken mold or removed improperly, each foot on the ring is a different length. Factory second quality.I received a call and an offer to replace the part with a first quality part. When this happens I will revise my review of this product, including a photo of the new ring.My rating is for the Foot Ring product not the company."
1,won't even withstand the rigors of assembly...,"The composite material of this cabinet is so cheap it crumbles around the screws that hold the pieces together, causing it to collapse in a heap before the product is even completely assembled. Save yourself a lot of time, money and aggravation. I wish I had."
2,False Advertising,"This review is not rating the movies themselves... I recently bought this set solely because of the fact that on the backside of the box it showed a picture of the Crash DVD as the ""2-Disc Director's Cut Edition"". Well, I bet you can guess how shocked I was when I opened the packaging to find the SINGLE DISC WIDESCREEN version of Crash. I call this LAME and FALSE advertising, and I'm immediately going to take this back to the store and demand either a refund or an exchange for the 2-Disc. This is BULL."
4,Getting a grip on Agrippa,"For modern students of magic the Renaissance has an irresistible appeal. Yet, when confronted with the mass of material that such masters of the Art as Agrippa present, they are often overwhelmed. It is not just five hundred years that seperate us from them, but an entire attitude, a way of looking at the world. Schrodter helps us to bridge that gap and makes the visible and invisible worlds of the Renaissance Magi accessible to modern practitioners of the arcane arts. While not a book for beginners, it is an excellant adjunct to anyone attempting to read Cornelius Agrippa's ""Three Books of Occult Philosophy"" or even the works of Dee, Ficino, Trithemius, or Albertus Magnus."
2,James Fillmore?,"As interested as I am in Japanese culture and history, I had some trouble with this book. First, Hoyt does not use the traditional Japanese rendering of names, that is family name first, then given name. That upset me. Soon following that, this book was read under a cloud of suspicionfrom page 8 on. I quote from said page, where Hoyt describes the impact of Commodore Perry's visit in 1853, when among Japanese barons was ""circulated the letter from American President James Fillmore..."", prompting the question ""Who the hell is James Fillmore""? When Perry sailed from Norfolk in 1852 the president was Millard Fillmore.Perhaps I'm picking at nits, but when an American writer can't get the name of a US president correct, that tends to cast a shadow of doubt over everything else he writes. That is a shame, for the book would have been an interesting take on the events described, had I been able to trust Mr Hoyt in the following 415 pages."
3,It's massive!,"We bought this for power ripping our cabinet face lumber stock on a 12"" cabinet saw and soon realised that it is too big for this - we got the 1/4 hp unit afterwards and use this instead. The 1 hp 'beast' is used only for feeding stock into our shaper for making raised panel doors and even then it's a bit too overpowered and big for what we need. If you are a one-man shop, it'll be too big for you unless it's permanently mounted to a machine (and a big one at that!) or you are built like Arnie.The guide that comes with it is not up to the usual Grizzly standard and we didn't see how we could have the rollers running directly over the sawblade without shredding the tires...It seems like a solidly built machine but its guide and size give it 3 stars."
5,Great Camoflage,"My son asked me to circle around the garage and surprise his friend wearing this. I was standing 3 paces in front of them as they discussed a radiator laying between us. He didn't see me. I tossed a large piece of wood down. He looked up past me to the left, then to the right, then straight into my eyes and practically crapped his pants.My only criticism is the ad says ""Includes Extra Leaves and Burlap In 7 Colors To Better Match Specific Terrain"". I got 1 black leaf and 1 string of burlap extra.Edit - I found the extra materials today. They were still in the box, in a seperate bag. For some reason I expected them to be in the big bag with the suit. Looks to be plenty of extra material."
3,An historic performance but not one of the greatest,"I must second the prior reviewer's reaction and caution purchasers that, despite the solid conducting and singing, in general, the opera is weighted towards the Leonore. It is amazing that Behrens sang this and other hoch-dramatisch roles, as she basically has a lyric instrument which cannot convey the true power of Leonore. A secondary blemish on this recording is the inclusion of too much of the dialogue --- this is also over-acted (probably in a traditional, German opera house manner) to the point where it sounds like chickens squawking. It emphasizes the dichotomy between the Singspiel and the rest of the opera."
2,Bohm is incandescent but Behrens is a let down,"The biggest reason to acquire this set is the incandescent conducting of Karl Bohm, in one of his last performance of this opera. Unfortunately, he's let down by Hildegard Behrens, whose voice is a size too small for the part and whose lower registers are chaotic. I'm surprised that Popp seems to be a bit out of sorts here. King is already past his prime and the other singers are adequate. An uneven performance."
2,strictly for Baroque guitar lovers,"As the title states, if you love Baroque guitar, you will love this album; if not, it's not for you. To me it's blah oh well, heard it all before, wasted $, lesson learned. There is lots of more interesting stuff to listen to such as Tomatito, Paco deLucia, etc."
4,not bad for a cheap antenna,"works as well as can be expected. i picked up 24 digital channels (8 in HD) on the first try just outside of chicago. i sometimes have to adjust it to get a steady signal, but it usually doesn't take much. as cheap as it is, it was worth a shot for me, might be for you too."
1,Cheaply made and couldn't pull in one channel.....,"Having bought a digital converter in anticipation of the end of analog, I hooked it up with a plain old RCA ""bunny ears"" antenna. I was able to get about 7 channels after playing around with locations. However, I really wanted to get PBS in and couldn't even get a weak signal, so I bought a Radio Shack amplified antenna and didn't get one channel in--back it went. Then I picked up this Philips PHDTV3 and gave it a try--same thing, not one single channel. It is also very cheaply made. One of the antennae snapped off when I twisted it ever so gently to a different angle.And the search continues...."
1,Junk,"I live 7 blocks from the Empire State Building, where many channels are broadcast from. I picked up a weak analog signal, and no HD signal. I moved to various parts around my apartment with the best reception being static-filled video, and the worst being no video and only audio. I can see if I was 75 miles from Manhattan, but the distance I am from the broadcast antenna is measured in hundreds of yards.There was no documentation included, and the unit feels cheaply made and clumsy. Returned for refund. Shame on you Phillips."
2,only got one HD main channel,"I guess it depends where you live, but from Marin in the Bay Area I could only get ABC in HD with this and a Chinese and Spanish channel..I wanted CBS, NBC, FOX and PBS as well from Sutro Tower but no joy. However, I'll play around with it some more after reading some of these comments, and maybe try gettign an extension and putting it outside!"
1,Doesn't work as well as it says,"It says it can pick up HDTV stations from a good distance, but it doesn't. I ended up buying a $20 antenna at Target and it gets the HD station I wanted to get tuned in."
1,no difference,I bought this antenna hoping it would be better than the one that came with my DirectTV subscription. It wasn't it sucked and I send it back.
4,it works fine,"I used a regular antenna but it seems like the amplified power is not enough, fot that reason I decided to buy this one. So far I don't have no complains, it is working properly (however I am considering an outdoor antenna due the poor reception in my area)."
3,No manual,"No manual, not even on line. Big and awkward to find a place to set it. Works better un-powered."
2,Space Junk,"I used this product with a computer tuner, it performed terribly. I tried it on a plasma tv and it still performed terribly. I was better off with a copper wire in the tv.It's poor design and plastic parts made it fall apart after moving it around trying to get reception.I replaced it with a set of rabbit ears at a garage sale for $.25. That was the best antenna purchase I have ever made. Digital signal does not require you to have anything special, older plain antennas do best.2 stars because it was better than nothing....eh, debatable."
1,I wish it actually worked,It was with great anticipation that I connected this antenna to the HDTV. Scanned the channels and was disappointed. This antenna performs no better than the rabbit ears antenna I bought at Radio Shack over 20 years ago. Boooooooo Philips!
3,Good Antenna,This antenna picks up most of the digital channels out there. It's very fussy though. You have to adjust it to get one channel and adjust it another way to get another channel. Other than that it works well and takes up little space.
1,Stay Away!!!,"Terrible, terrible antenna. I don't know where to begin on how terrible this antenna is. I haven't been able to get a perfect signal on a channel since I have owned this thing, which is a couple of months by now.I have my television by a glass door, I live on the third floor of my building, and I am still unable to get a steady signal. I haven't watched a single show where it doesn't ""hic-up"" or freeze. No matter where I put it or how I adjust it I cannot get a steady signal.If your looking for a good antenna this is not it! I can't tell you how many times I have been close to punting this off the side of my balcony. Stay away!!"
2,Not Sure About This One,"If this item's performance is tied to signal variations between locations, it did not work in Champaign, IL.However, the design and material are good values for the price, but unfortunately I could not verify functionality. I really had to take it back and Amazon were very accumodating, thanks to their great customer support."
1,No HD Channels\No Documentation\No support,"I bought two of these since I have TVs in different rooms. One worked poorly and one didn't work at all. The one that worked a little bit picked up some regular TV channels. It didn't pick up a single HD channel, and I live in Chicago where I know that HD channels are available. The unit that didn't work at all didn't even pick up regular TV channels.Even if they had worked, it would have been annoying that there was documenation in the box, and the Phillips web site doesn't even list this as a product."
1,Cheap plastic doesn't hold up.,"I bought this to complement my cable service to get the local HDTV channels. After painstakingly setting it up to point in the right direction to get the right signals (took about an hour) I was informed by my girlfriend that she didn't think it went with the decor in the room and I could use it, but put it away when I'm not watching TV. Women... But I do have to agree, it is kind of big and ugly, but I'm a guy, it was working and I was happy. After raising and lowering the antennae a couple of times to put it away and take it back out, it broke. I took it apart and the metal screw that holds the anntena to the body was screwed into the plastic body!! How cheap is that?? The same screw also had a wire attached for the signal, so not only did the antenna come loose, I lost the signal. The screw hole threads were stripped. What a waste of money."
1,Didn't work for me,"I gave this a try, based on some favorable reviews, but was very disappointed. In my house (metro DC area), I got weak reception of analog channels, and NO reception of any of the HD digital channels. The product didn't even come with any documentation to help me troubleshoot and try to improve the performance. After an hour or so of tinkering with angles, positioning, etc... I gave up. At least in my home, in my local broadcast area, this antenna was worthless for picking up HDTV broadcasts."
1,Not Sure if This Thing Does Anything,"The first one i had was broken. So Amazon replaced it, quick. Thanks! Anyhow... It doesn't take a genius to figure out how to plug it in, but they could have given SOME instructions. What does the little knob do? Anything? I can't tell any difference. How should I point the antenna for best reception? People and objects moving about the house can affect the reception, channels come an go sometimes for no reason. I can get the same quality picture just by hooking up a long coax..."
1,Expensive Rabbit Ears.,"This is no better than the old fashion rabbit ears. The ""powered"" portion of this antenna does NOTHING to boost the signal. I found this item to be almost useless since it does not pick up any analog signals very well at all. As for the digital signals, you will have to adjust the antenna whenever you change the channel.If you spent your hard earned money on a HDTV, why are you going to buy a junkie antenna?"
3,Seems to do its job,"This is the first powered antenna that I have bought, so I am no expert. It seems to work O.K., but I guess I had high expectation. Some channels come in O.K, but others still have static or don't come in at all. It also seems to be very picky on its location, since it works better in some areas over others. You also have to play with the rabbit ears a lot. Sometimes, I had to play with the rabbit ears so much that I just said forget it! However, in its defence, there are some local channels that I would not be able to see without it."
1,Does not do the job.,"It worked better when it was off! I thought I was going to get some great improvement, but instead the reception was worse! As soon as I turned on the amplifier, the signal is gone! Maybe mine is broken; I can't believe anyone would sell this honestly. I tried it on two different receivers and then compared with 3 other antennas I had - this one was the worst of all!"
2,no better than unamplified HDTV rabbit ears,"I fussed with this antenna for several years before it broke. I replaced it with $10 RCA rabbit ears, and they work better, with less drop-outs. I live in MD (suburban DC) and have my rabbit ears in the attic, connected to the TV with a 50-foot coaxial cable. I get all channels except channel 9, which is low VHF. For people in urban areas who need only a unidirectional antenna, I'd say give regular HDTV rabbit ears a try.Basic Indoor AntennaYou might save yourself some money."
2,picture reminds me of jar-jar from phantom menace,"If you had no antenna, then this would be an improvement. Otherwise, spend your money on a better one - there are many. Check out antennaweb."
5,Glucofit,I recently bought this product online and it arrived on time. The seller is charging a $11 for shipping which is extremely high and hope there are others who would be willing to ship this for a lower price.
1,"More like ""Creative Marketing""","This should have been called The Book of Candles. If you can imagine yourself shoving candles eveywhere the sun don't shine - then you don't need this book. If you find the idea of painting an old watering can and putting a candle in it to be a novel idea - look no further, this is the book for you!The cover is nice and implies a book rich in color and sophistication. Unfortunatly, it reflects the best this book has to offer.I hate to be this negative but I feel deceived."
2,Disappointing,"I found part one somewhat valuable/ part two was worthless. I need the tablature or better closeups of the neck.Furthermore, when he's talking about ""triads"" and other music talk, he could just as well be speaking Greek.This series doesn't fully utilize the power of video, IMHO.I found the Song Xpress video series to be far more helpful, and more visual. I just wish they would produce some new ones, especially on the blues."
3,3 1/2 stars,"say what you want about both her and S CLub. but you can't say that they, nor er can't sing b/c you'd be lying. out of all of them, Jo does have the strongest voice. [as showcased in ""Reach and ""Never Had A Dream Come True] this album is no different. vocally she rises to the challenge everytime especially w/ the single that Rascal Flatts so slyly remade here in the U.S., ""What Hurts The Most"".and the other songs are great too but the only reason I gave this album 3 1/2 stars is b/c it's an album full of ballads. while I do love ballads, I would love to hear a club jam or two thrown in the mix just change it up a bit. but otherwise it is a good CD you'll just have to listen to half now and half later like I did since it's full of ballads. but I do hope to hear more from here in the future. her voice is amazing !!!"
4,Finally,"Well, I have been a fan of S Club since there were 7 of them in Miami. After the split Rachel came out with a very good album and I was wondering what happend to the others. I finally here that Jo has a new album out and I have to get it imported to the states. After missing the clubbers and hearing this album I forgot just what an amazing voice she has. If you like pop music get this album."
2,I didn't get much out of it,I was hoping that this book would help me to find a process to answer issues wround finding meaning and signifcance in life-it didn't. Seemed to be just a bunch of quotes from other authors that didn't inspire me.
2,Didn't care for this video,"I found this video to be too long without much payback in terms of relaxation. I also thought that some of the exercises were inappropriate for the early postnatal period but that Colette neglected to point all of them out. Some are noted, but occasionally not until after the pose is shown, so some people might be tempted to do too much too soon. I also didn't care much for the production quality. I guess I'm just used to the Living Arts videos. I would also have preferred to see more babies in the video, as one of the reasons I bought it was to find a way to exercise while my son was awake. Since he never napped for more than 10 minutes at a time and needed constant holding, I was disappointed to find no poses modified so that you could use your infant as part of the pose.Prenatally I did the Yoga Mama video and Shiva Rea's video, both of which I truly enjoyed. They are both very different from this video, which may be one of the reasons I don't like it that much."
2,Disappointed,"I agree completely with the previous reviewer. I also religiously followed a vigorous prenatal yoga routine and found this routine to be way too easy and wimpy. There isn't much in the way of yoga poses. The first segment of breathing/flow exercises is nice, but again, not in the least bit challenging. I'm not saying I want to run a marathon or anything (I'm only 3 weeks postpartum), but I almost feel as if it would be better to relax on the couch and do nothing than to spend an entire precious hour on this tape!!"
3,"Good stretch, not much of a workout","Maybe it's good for those first few weeks postpartum, mostly stretching and some abdominal exercises, but not much of a challenge.After doing prenatal yoga during my entire pregnancy (that included squats and lots of standing poses), this seems kind of wimpy."
2,Interesting but incomplete,"This book has a large amount of very interesting information but, oddly, gives scant treatment to major Hebrew and Christian figures of ancient times and Jewish/Christian history while significant coverage is given to the birth of Buddhism, Confucian morality, the rise of Islam, the Koran, Hinduism, ancient Egyptian religious practices and even the gods of the ancient Mesopotamians. The establishment of the great Jewish and Christian religions should have been included on par with these other religions, especially as the book is published by a major U.S. tax-supported institution, the Smithsonian, and the vast majority of the Americans who support the Smithsonian are either Jewish or Christian. The Jewish and Christian religions have had a significant impact on world history and so a book of this type is incomplete if they are not covered."
4,Great Study Aid,"This book has only three LSAT tests, but the study material included is great. It gives a walkthrough of practice questions. If you are studying for the LSAT, official LSAT books are the way to go. They are made by the test writes and are more helpful than other non official books."
4,Mediocre Advice -- Great Preptests,"I received SuperPrep from the LSAC for free due to economic need. The book starts with an overview of strategies to attack the LSAT. These strategies are rudimentary and, when compared to other commercially available prep material, are rather useless.With that said: The preptests are very useful. First, the tests are relatively new. Second, they are very difficult. Compared to the ""Official 10 LSAT Test"" booklets these preptests are very challenging. Third, and most importantly, the LSAC gives an official explanation for the `right' answer. The ""Official 10"" booklets do not do this.Buy SuperPrep only if you have the money to spare. It is not essential but it is certainly helpful."
5,THE BEST LSAT REVIEW BOOK!,It's unfortunate that the book only review three official LSAT tests but the explanations for the questions are GREAT. I wish they would do this for every official LSAT published since it's the best way to study for the LSAT. practice practice practice!
4,a good place to start,"this book is not going to be all that i need to prepare for taking the lsat but its a good compass for strengths and weaknesses. it is also helpful as a look into the perspective the tests originate from. i like that the writers are not into any kind of head trip; i've read other stuff about test taking (for the lsat, the gre's etc) and the books always get into various psychologies, you wont find that here. just straight up tests, analysis of question types and answers broken down. if i had the attention span to memorize all of the information in here i could probably kill the test with this book alone (plus some more practice tests) but chances are i will have to resort to more gimmicky stuff because it is just a little to dry for it to be worth the effort."
5,Best LSAT prep when you have no time to prep,I didn't have time to study for the LSAT and ONE week before the LSAT I worked with this book and my score went from 145 to 153! (153 is not so bad considering that my language is spanish and I didn't prep at all). I'm assuming that for an english native speaker this could mean you can score a 163-165 without having to study for 3 months.The book explains every type of question you're going to find on the LSAT and it contains 3 February tests so you can practice. Each prep test has the answers and every choice fully explained.So if you don't have time to prep this is the best book you can work with.Good Luck!
4,Efficient and thorough,"I only had 3 weeks to prepare for the LSAT, and this book helped me quickly spot my weaknesses and create solutions to tackle them effectively."
4,A nice starting block for those studying for the LSAT,"This is probably the first book you should buy in your LSAT preping. Keep in mind though there are free resources you can find, you just need to google and hunt around for them. You can even join a law school message board/forum and ask around for study materials there.Anyways, this book is a nice start because it offers you 3 tests, explanations for the wrong answers and some strategies for taking the test. It's a pretty easy read and they really work hard to break the test down for you to bite sized nuggets. It's not the last book you'll buy for the LSAT but it works and you'll probably feel a bit more confident in your abilities after using this book."
1,I havent recieved it,Hi I haven't received my item and I did not even receive a tracking number for it. . . .
2,"Pretty crap, unfortunately","This book has 3 LSAT preptests and explanations for each test. The preptests are:SuperPrep A; February 1996SuperPrep C; February 1999SuperPrep B; February 2000Unfortunately either LSAC outsourced the explanations or they are absolutely horrible at explaining their own test. I actually suspect its the second. LSAC has created a very complex, highly intelligent, extremely complicated and competent test. In every other way they are just totally awful. From proctoring to sending out preptests to setting up testing centers they are, unfortunately, full of fail.If you want explanations, buyCheating The LSAT: The Fox Test Prep Guide to a Real LSAT, Volume 1. Do not buy the ones from LSAC.If you want more LSAT tips and hints visit 180degreeslsat.com"
4,A valuable stuff for knowing the perspectives of LSAC on LSAT,A very good review material that reveals the logical thinking and definitions behind the LSAC staff. It even tells the strategy on how to crack some questions more quickly. It widens the ways of thinking. But a bit pity is the leaves get easily fallen with your reading going forward.
5,GET THIS BOOK,"At first, I wasted my time with prep materials not written by the LSAC. Many of the questions seemed too easy or too hard. Additionally, many of these materials are plagued with typos, misreads and incorrect arguments. I suppose this is due to them being written by one, or maybe just a few, author(s). In contrast, the LSAT superprep is great. The questions are real LSAT tests from the past and the explanations help greatly. There are no typos I have found yet and the level of questions are much more realistic (actually, they're REAL so they must be realistic :). True, the material might be a bit dull at times but, Hey, that's how the test is anyway. You're not getting this book for entertainment, you're getting it to ace the LSAT. Good luck!"
2,Not the best LSAT book,"The Good: This book offers a great deal of information on the LSAT and being created by the same people who write the LSAT makes it useful. It contains a lot of actual LSAT questions which is great for when it comes time to do the practice tests.The Bad: The book uses the same, often confusing, language when describing the questions you will be tackling as the questions themselves. They do not do a great job connecting the dots between the review portion of the book and answering of the question. The review sections offer an overview of the four sections of the LSAT but do not give strategy as to solving them.I highly recommend the Powerscore books, the Logic Games Bible in particular. I am using this book in conjunction with that one because the LSAT SuperPrep offers so many actual, past used, test questions."
3,Ok,"Lots of practice tests, but otherwise the material was useless to me. I went with the Logical Reasoning Bible by power score."
1,Rusted when left to soak,"Really wanted this, but it was rusting when I soaked it over night. Hard to clean, but it would have been worth it if it was high quality. Very Disappointed"
4,Good for the price,"I needed a small adjustable roasting rack, as I am usually cooking for two and this means small roasts and chickens vs much larger pieces of meat. I opted against a nonstick design because I kept reading about problems with the coating coming off on the food. This product is not non-stick so it has no such problem. It still cleans up ok but hand-washing can be a bit of a pain. Folds flat for easy storage.I wish the adjustable aspect of it was a little more sturdy. The feet come out of the grooves fairly easily when trying to position your meat, which is a not that big a deal unless you like to rotate your meat halfway through cooking. However once positioned it is fairly sturdy and could probably hold a much larger sized roast or bird than we usually use in our house. For the price I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a smaller sized roasting rack."
5,Great oven rack!,"I have a large, 19 inch, Granite Wear roasting pan and this rack fit perfectly inside of it. I like that the rack is adjustable too!"
4,Very good book for its value,An all inclusive text of dermatology in one volume much likeAndrew's but from the other side of the Atlantic.
2,Difficult to use.,"I have a hard time trying to figure out how to use it. I like to pick a number and go for it, not in this edition."
2,The Prophet Muhammad - A Biography,"Nice story. But really allows Muhammad to get away with his very emotional behavior. His destruction of the Jewish communities is excused away as a necessary act for him to establish Islam and unite the arab tribes. Muhammad was just like other tribal leaders but claimed he was a prophet of Allah. Story is interesting but very biased away from any judgement on the amoral actions that Muhammad did. It is not really a factual biography but one which has been manipulated in order to present Muhammad as a man of god. Truth and story become intermingled and therefore loses any sense of reality. Bottom line, the arabs were very war like and committed blood revenge for insults. Brutal men is really all they were. I would really not want to deal with any of these violent beings !"
2,"Enjoyable, BUT.......","Mr. Rogerson has written an excellent portrait of the Prophet, woven into the lives and times of Arabia in the 7th Century. While extremely readable, unfortunately it contains certain glaring inaccuracies. To name but a few:* He misquotes the first revealtion to the Prophet as being from Surah Ignaa (page 89). It should be Surah Alaq.* On page 91 he refers to Kadir, when it should be Layl-atul -Qadr.* On page 114 he refers to the Prophet's ""daughter"" Aisha. Hazrat Aisha was his wife.-Sami T. Ahmad."
5,Fantastic Read,"Was recommended by a friend because I enjoy fictional crime novels. Found it incredibly interesting, especially knowing these were real incidences. Would highly encourage others to read this book. But set aside some time, cause you won't want to put it down."
1,"Great subject matter, poor execution","I hate to pile on, but I have to agree that what sounds like a very interesting book about art theft and recovery is completely undercut by the poor writing and editing. I normally don't give up on books, but I bailed on this one after the second chapter. Way too hackneyed with its attempts at being ""hard boiled"" and introducing ""ironies"" that were not particularly ironic. I hope McShane gets a second chance to write this, but with better guidance from an editor and publisher."
2,Stolen Masterpiece Tracker,"I bought this book because I heard a radio interview with the FBI agent which was interesting. The content is indeed interesting, but it is poorly written - and that makes it a tough read."
4,Nice basic sandbox toy set,"this is a nice, basic sandbox toy set. nice variation of toys to keep things interesting. quality to good enough. for the price it might be hard to wrong with this set."
5,sand tools,This was a good purchase I think because my daughter loves it. I bought her a sand box and she is constantly playing and making up things with the sand toys. It is great. They came just in time for Christmas and in great condition. She hasn't stopped playing with them ever since.
4,Ride on girl...ride on!,"Boy, I would love to see this sistah live! Great production quality, great instrumentation and her song-writing abilities are diverse. As with so many other albums that are out, one can get bored very easily listening to the album of the ""artist of the day"" to what is essentially the same tune played in a different key and meter.My favorite cuts include ONLY WAY TO SAY GOODBYE, MOTHER'S CHILD and of course RIDE. I bought two copies of the CD in early spring so that I would have the opportunity to ride, sunroof down with that song BLASTING down the highway for THIS summer. I've worn out Lenny Kravitz's I've Gotta Get Away for the last year and a half and it's time to rotate. (Besides the Highway PO-PO are starting to realize its before they see me). LOLMaybe Chrysler or Ford will consider this jam as a new summer car song for this year. I know I have!"
5,Loved it!,My daughter loves the Doodlebops and loves this video! I bought 3 of them for her birthday and definitely plan on buying more Doodlebops videos!
4,Doodlebops ROCK!!!!!!!!!,"I have 2 boys ages 1 and 2 and they LOVE the Doodlebops!!!! This is the ONLY movie or TV program they will sit still long enough to watch!! We Loves these video's, we can't wait to get the new one!!!"
5,An Overlooked Gem,"What a shame that this fantastic album never got the attention it deserved -- especially in the U.S. The album is especially noteworthy for the longer (and much better) versions of How Many Lies and Through the Barricades, both of which were issued in their single formats on The Best of Spandau Ballet. The ballad Swept is easily as gorgeous as anything from the True album, and Snakes and Lovers is absolutely infectious."
4,Through the times,"Very good bands are faithfull to their roots and style. If we add to that the fact that the members of Spandau Ballet, remained the same through the good and bad, we have a group of people very determined to do something that will break the boundaries of years to come. They have a personal sound, and you can't deny you are hearing a Spandau's album from the beginning to the end. Classics like ""Through the barricades"" ""How Many Lies?"" or ""Fight for Ourselves"" are a proof of that."
4,Not as good as the Quattro,"I used to have a Rotring Quattro and loved it. So, why don't I love the Trio? It's not just that I miss the 4th pen. Actually, it's kinda nice that the Trio is slimmer. What I really miss is the full-fledged mechanical pencil. Gone is the ability to load leads (including spares) from the back. Also gone is the eraser with a pin for cleaning out broken bits of lead from the tip. As for the quality of the ballpoint refills, I don't care. I happened to have a Fisher Space Pen refill, so I use that.Pros- Looks nice- Works flawlessly- Slimmer than the competition- Retract button is where it won't getpressed by accident.Cons- pencil lead can only be loaded fromthe front.- no place to carry spare leads- no cleaning pin in eraser"
1,Where did all the good Rotring Trios go.,"I used to have a number of the Rotring 600 Trio pens from the 90's I gifted most of them and now I want to hunt those people down and ask for them back. They were well made, smooth, and a real piece of German Technology. This pen show say made in China if it does not already. I used it for one day and it is sitting in my car's center console in case I need a pen. it has a prominent seat next to the pen I stole from the bank and the one from Planet Fitness."
4,An Entertaining Romp,"The most light-hearted of all 6 disks of the Mahoromatic series, these five episodes are almost pure slapstick. Watching these you nearly forget the underlying pathos of the story. Enjoy it, because the next disk will break your heart."
3,"Great, But Misleading DVD Length","As a Paul Simon fan, I really enjoyed this DVD, because he played his music in this concert very true to the greatness of the melodies, with all arrangements in very good taste, as opposed to his later tours where his renditions of the music really are kind of out there.I've never seen a DVD that is almost half as short as advertised. That is totally unacceptable and I don't see how they got away with doing that. If it is made half the price from the original price, I would say that would be a fair exchange.But that takes nothing away from the good music. Enjoy."
3,"Good, but not the highlight of the series","I'm not saying that this book isn't a good read, but it isn't the highlight of the series either.It is, however, important in seeing into Talia's character more. In this book, she is sent out on her internship with Herald Kris. After having a small doubt put into her mind about her ability to conciously control her Gift, and whether or not she is using it to control the Council or to merely aid her in her duties, that doubt grows into something that could destroy her, and anyone around her.But Kris refuses to give up on her, and schools her in control of her Gift the only way he knows how- as a teacher, not a friend. And although he regrets having to be so tough, the result is more than proof that he made the right decision.You also get a good look into what exactly can go on in a circuit and internship, where no other book has given you this insight. That in itself was what made this book very worthwhile."
3,Arrow's Flight,"I liked Arrows of the Queen a lot, and was anxious to read Arrow's Flight, but it was a bit of a letdown.There isn't any solid plot or climax to Arrow's Flight. As in most trilogies, it's the weakest of the three, serving only as a bridge between the beginning novel, which introduces the characters and the problems, and the final novel, which resolves the climax.Talia is finally a Herald, and is going off on her year-and-a-half circuit training with Kris. Most of the story involves Talia trying to control her Empathic Gift, which has gone out of control because of rumours flying around that she's using her Gift for her own advantage. It's not the most interesting of the three, but if you want to understand Arrow's Fall, read it, even if you don't buy it. But don't read it on its own."
4,Bravo Talia!!,What a wonderful story of friendship and overcoming powerful obstacles! I couldn't help but feel the emotions of the book. Couldn't wait to get into the next book.
4,Good....but the first was better!,"The Arrows books are great, I have read all three of them 2 times,but I like the second one better! The Arrows Flight book made my emotions go haywire. My favorite park was when Talia and Kris found out about Talias gift and it going rouge. Also when Kris gets big Egoed and thinks Talia is fixated on him. Talia ends up kicking his butt in the river. Dirk and Kris are so close that he just didn't want to hurt her, now he really doesn't! Altogether I loved it it had adventure, romance, and mystery, my three favorites! I hope you read it too!!!"
3,Second Book Of Trilogy,"I have read all three books of Heralds of Valdemar in a week. As one reader commented ,This is second book of a Trilogy and it shows. Talia becomes a full herald and starts normal internship for one and half year journey. She lost her control of gift.Most of the story resolves around them going from town to town and lost of control of gift. Character build up is very well written. Learning more about typical herald duties help to understand World of Valdemar. Being a Dungeon Master myself, I liked these parts of story.But there were some points, I disliked. A battle against brigands where 15 to 2 (well 4 with companions). Unrealistic combat.Also when a healer understand that she lost her shields, she only tell them get your shields instead of helping her.Overall trilogy was good."
2,"Good, but not great.","I am a beginner to Mercedes Lackey's books, and after reading Arrows of the Queen I expected there to be more action and drama. I was dissapointed. I didn't like the snowed in part, which seemed to be the climax, and the amount of sex when she didn't love the man disturbed me. I highly doubt it possible to be doing your teacher, learning, and staying friends at the same time. Mrs. Lackey also has an incredible amount of typos in her books. You would think she would be able to spell her own character's names. And last, I got tired of Talia feeling sorry for herself. That is one of the reasons that the plot (?) dragged. I feel that Mrs. Lackey is good, but she should have put far more thought and time into this book, writing and editing."
1,Poor quality (when much better quality is available online for free!),"Quality of this mp3 is poor. Sound is crackly and faint. I'm disappointed with this purchase and will not likely purchase other Amazon.com digital offerings. This one should never have been offered for sale. My wife later found a free mp3 of this same offering elsewhere on the Internet (apparently a legal download) which was 12 minutes longer than this one yet over 10 Mb smaller in filesize and much cleaner, clearer and louder. I don't recommend this product. Yes, the work is classic but the product is not."
5,Former editor says great book,"Hi Lynne, Thought this would be a funny way to get in touch. Hope all is well. Think of you and your family often."
1,Not Worth Even One Star,"The field of Television Studies has produced more than its fair share of scholarly rubbish, but this book is absolutely the worst book in the field that I've read--that's quite an achievement! It's rambling, badly written, and utterly mediocre. The author doesn't seem to have a clue what she wants to say. How this nonsense got published at all is mystifying. Boring, predictable, and best avoided."
2,Target not as pictured,"This was a last minute Christmas gift. There was no description of the target, so I bought it purely from the picture which showed the target on legs several inches deep. When it arrived it was just a rolled up plastic target sheet. I returned it and was promptly credited. I think more descriptions or visuals were needed to avoid incorrect assumptions. Two stars for being well packaged and for timely delivery."
4,The friendship/the Gold Cadillac,"Cassie Logan and her brothers have been warned never to go to the Wallace store, so they know to expect trouble there. What they don't expect is to hear Mr. Tom Bee, an elderly black man, daring to call the white storekeeper by his first name. The year is 1933, the place is Mississippi, and any child knows that some things just don't happen. This is a powerful and emotional story. The reader will remember this story for years to come."
3,"Rocks Fall, Everybody Dies","I enjoyed the series more than the final book. It has a ""contractual obligation"" feel - that the author had to write an ending to the series, but couldn't really figure out how to do so. Previous events in the series as well as the first part of this book set up the bad guys as nearly unstoppable - until they are suddenly stopped. Plenty of loose ends are left in the plot, but since all the major characters are dead the book ends.If you've read the series, by all means finish it with this book. But prepare for some disappointment."
3,Not as great as other,"My daughter, 22 months old, has loved the Shalom Sesame video about the seasons of the year for a long time. I recently bought this one, ""the land of israel"". She does not like it as much as the other. THis one has songs that seem older, less lively. Some of the dialog is stilted, slower. Yet, it is a good video and has great educational value. It also has actual violin playing by Itzak Perlman. I'm hoping my kid will learn to love it."
3,Red Can Opener,"This can opener is no greater or less than one you can find on a popular discount store shelf. I had purchased this for my grand daughter who for the first time was setting up housekeeping. Her basic background color was red....outside of not being able to purchase a red can opener at the popular discount store, I would recommend just saving time and money by opting out for a white one...UNLESS .... everything has to match such as with my grand daughter. wink wink.....I gave it low rating due to the fact it was not an outstanding item outside of it being Red. It has been durable and still remains in tact a year later!"
1,Unfortunately this item never arrived.... and Amazon does nothing!,"Apparently because this is a Target product, Amazon does nothing about the problem that I never received this item. Nope, there is no avenue for Amazon to resolve this problem. I probably won't order anything else from Amazon that comes from an outside vendor."
4,Reefs BYOB,"Sandal is great love it, however it does hold foot moisture and needs to be washed often or it begins to smell"
5,Reef Mens Sandal,I bought these for my husband and he loves them. Especially the bottle opener! They are very comfortable and he wears them all the time!
2,Fragile...arrived broken!,"I do not recommend ordering this item online, as it is too fragile to hold up well in shipping! Mine arrived broken, and I asked for credit rather than a replacement, as I was afraid that the same thing would happen again."
5,Sango Nova Blue 6-Cup Pitcher,This is in excellent condition. It is a very beautiful piece I will enjoy it for years to come. Thanks
1,Not always humane!,"Be aware that those traps are not always humane. I purchased mine for a mice problem in my garage. The first time I used it it killed the mouse. Her head got stuck in the mechanism - it was horrible! When I found her she was half-dead and I'm pretty sure that she was suffering for many hours. I'm returning it to the store today. I'm aware that it could be just stupid accident (judging by other reviews) and I was just unlucky, but the product should have a warning that it could happen. After all we are purchasing it specifically for the reason of catching them alive!..."
2,win 90%??? almost,"Truly enjoyed reading about some of the old time hucksters, but as far as getting some real worthwhile tips on relieving my playing partners of their burdensome cash... not many. I found a few tips of note regarding handicapping your match just prior to teeing off (reading the scorecard handicap holes to figure out if its worth giving strokes or vice versa) but beyond that most of the info was about high dollar games that really meant nothing to me personally. beware guys breaking into your locker and changing your lofts... really? I'm a muni golf guy. anyway, lots of interesting stories but few tips for my weekend nassau / bingobangobongo games."
2,Broke after using it only twice,"I would not recommend this product, too bad...as the heart shape looks really nice and the size of it is perfect. Unfortunately it started leaking after using it only once or twice. I am unable to lock the two pieces back together, so it is unusable now...."
3,Hard to use in a water bath,I bought two of these pans for valentine's day.This pan looks great but I had a terrible time using it in a water bath when making a cheesecake.I ended up throwing away 3 cakes due to water leaking in even after double wrapping it in tin foil.This could be due the irregular share of the pan but no matter how hard it tried to stop the leaks it still ruined the crusts.They work fine when not using them in water but then the cakes have a tendency to cook faster at the edges.
5,love it,bought it for whenever i want to bake and stuff. and so far its working great. the quality is not cheap and easy to remove
2,Great title no content,"I have been a fan of Sean Bean for some time - from the first time I saw the Sharpe series through the Robert Lovelace/Clarissa role and the odd villainous appearances. I don't generally read biographies of actors but thought since he'd portrayed such an interesting variety of characters that there would be an interesting person behind them. However, I wouldn't know if there was or not. He seems to have led an interesting life but there really isn't a shred of the man himself in this book.Maybe it's too much to expect - I wasn't looking for dirt but I was certainly looking for substance and found nothing. ""Everyone likes him, he's a man's man, he's a great actor"". The book leads you to believe that he had about as much depth as a cereal bowl and I tend to think that there's more to this actor than that. I found it very vacuous."
4,Great for Fans who are new to the world of Sean Bean,"As I am a relatively new devotee to the works of Sean Bean (FOTR), I found this a wonderful guide to his past roles. Although it does not delve very deeply into Sean as a person, it is a very useful travel guide to the World Of Bean. Also very nice to know that there are some actors who like ""real"" women & not skeletons!"
5,love it,"its the simpsons, you cant say anything bad about this hat. its great and it has Ralph picking his nose!"
1,Too Many Problems,I bought 2 units of LaCie 2 TB HDD. Both broke down after a couple of months mainly due to a power adapter failure. Their customer service is great and sent me replacement adapters a few times for free. Both were up and running but one is down again. They also create some sort of conflict when both are attached to one computer.
1,die for no reason,"I have a lacie 2TB network drive. It is very slow. and after 12 months, it die for no reason. This is the second drive like this. It is very bad."
1,Disappointing,The drive failed after about a year... clicking sound. I have been buying LaCie drives since the early '90s but am done after a few of these episodes. Their brand was once a name to be trusted... now it's just another french-sounding failure in my book. Too bad they let their quality go to the dogs.
1,"Not working as advertised, may be broken","I had problems with firewire (ie it wouldn't work) immediately--I attributed this to my flaky firewire card. It worked well under USB, but there were weird problems with my computer (Outlook would hang)--these resolved whenever the drive was off.I attempted to use this drive with my laptop today, first via firewire then by usb. It got about halfway through a big file copy when the drive went offline and I haven't been able to get it back since.This is just too flaky, a HDD for backups needs to be johny on the spot and work. I will not use Lacie again, not even for a doorstop."
1,"Power Supply fails time after time, very poorly built","I bought this HD unit a couple of years ago via Amazon UK. What I liked about it was the large capacity coupled with the variety of connection options. I have had a few good months with it, but not for long... After a few months I started hearing loud squeeking noises. I have contacted the vendor, and was advised of a suspected power supply. It didn't take long for the unit to stop functioning. Lacie had sent a new power supply to me in NYC, free of charge. since then I have replaces three power supplies (bought them via amazon) and I do not treat this disc as a reliable one, as I never know what to expect or when it will simply die."
1,Terrible Customer Service,"My La Cie drive failed after 2 years with 40 years of lessons, the back-up to the iPod classic with over 8500 songs, two dozen travel movies I edited, and thousands of photos. This was the back-up to my iMac, and I was unable to get the data from it despite having a company spend three weeks trying. La Cie blew me off with using some recovery program that did absolutely nothing after 7 hours of examining the drive. Disk Repair utility on the Mac could not repair the disk. I was told to go to an outside company by a totally unsympathetic La Cie technician.I am very disappointed in this drive as the company hypes it in MacWorld."
1,WATCH OUT!,"I've had several Lacie external FW drives fail on me in the last month or so - a 500GB, a 1TB and a 2TB.The reason seems to be that I may have powered up one Lacie drive with the (identical-looking) power supply from another. It turns out you can't do this and plugging in a Lacie drive with a Lacie power supply from a second drive (even if it's identical spec) can fry it!Great, huh? I've been told Western Digital and G-Tech are better. Lacies seem really flaky."
4,I have about 8 of these drives.,"I have used Lacie drives for at least 4 years. I have four 500 Gigabytes sizes, 5 single terabyte sizes and 1 two terabyte size. I have never had a problem with any of them."
1,"Complete waste of money, effort and time","bought this just over a year ago and it has died. After one year you cannot even pay to have Lacie look at your hard drive. I was told to ""throw it in the trash"" by their customer support. I have bought BuffaloTech Terastation, Infrant ReadyNAS, Western Digital and Seagate drives and RAID arrays and this is by far the worst. If you want a hard drive that will not last and give just adequate performance during its short life expectancy Lacie is the way to go. I can't think of one single positive thing to say about the hard drive or their customer service. There are other cheap alternatives (some cheaper) that offer better quality. Good luck."
1,Disaster,"I purchased two of these to store a 1.2 TB media collection and to back it up. After 6 months BOTH failed and it's costing me $6000 to get the data back. Lacie has offered to look at the drives, but states that the data will be lost. Never buy a Lacie product."
1,danger will robinson!,"mine died within a year -- it would periodically fail, restart, vanish, reappear, before finally grinding to a perminant death. i replaced it (about four months ago) the new one is chugging along but this is really the first time i've ever had a drive fail like that. gah."
1,Dead.,"I'm sitting here with my 6-month old 1TB LaCie drive...whirring and knocking and...no data. Hosed. The consultant we brought in strongly recommended that we only use these drives as backups for our backups. Unfortunately, I didn't get around to backing it up and now whatever is on this drive...important stuff...is gone. Never again. Wish I had read all these reviews before buying one at the Apple store."
1,Buy any other drive,"Pros for the 2TB LaCie external drive? When working it is quiet. And, when under warranty, they happily repair it. I know, because the one I bought has crashed twice and had to be sent back. It is back now, fixed again, but I don't trust it enough to put any more data on it."
4,"""SOME OF THE 80'S BEST""","Considered part the the ""NWOBHM"" movement, these guys made a notable contribution. If you like raw-pure Heavy Metal, this is for you. Their sound is a bit unrefined but this is probably due to the production. The material is good enough to overlook the fact and you'll be hooked once you hear it. When listening to it, you'll be transported back to the early 80's and be reminded of just how good Metal was back then. Get it! It's packed full of great Metal classics."
5,"2 Become 1 is an awesome single, a must buy for any Spice Gi","This title is very good for the true Spice fans. It takes one song, gives us a slightly different version, totally cool remix, an awesome b-side and a remix of an old favourite. Since the songs on this title are different it's good just to put on repeat. Spice Girls did a great job with this song, and they will do an even better job on the third album!"
5,Become 1 With This Excellent C.D.,"2 Become 1: Part 1 of 2 is a great single release from the Spice Girls C.D., Spice. It is the best song on the disc and the single has some great extras. Here's a breakdown of each song:2 Become 1(Radio Edit)-(5)Cuts out some chourses, but that helps make the song even better.2 Become 1(Orchestral Version)- (4) Shows off the great music, but no Spice Girls?One Of These Girls- (5) A Great B-Side!Could've replaced Something Kinda... on the c.d.Wannabe(Junior Vasquez Remix)-(5) A great new mix of Wannabe! Non-repitive, cool sounds.Go get 2 Become 1 Part 1 At Amazon.com now!"
2,Don't really like this single anymore!,"These days, who have you come across who still like the spice girls!?Anyways, tracks on this CD are very atrochious, the tracks which I actually used to like, apart from song 4.The first three tracks are pathetic, the first two not having much difference than an instrumental & orchestral song! Versions of 2 Become 1 are really downhill but I did like these songs. Just check out the Dave Cross Remix for the amazing music!Three, One Of These Girls, is the worst of the worst. The lyrics make you cry and they are pathetic: One Of these girls is doin' their own thing, one of these girls is just not the same. I prefer Bumper To Bumper but that's pretty rubbish too!Track four is the look-foward to track. It's a remix of Wannabe by Junior Vasquez. It's a great 5:57 minute remix which will keep you dancing and suprisingly, the song is a one to treasure! It starts off with a thumping beat and will for-definate keep you on your feet!Bad single, good remix of Wannabe."
3,An interesting documentary,"Chronicling Narnia tells of CS Lewis' inspiration for creating the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe as well as the rest of the Narnia series. This was released prior to the movie being released in theaters.Narrated by Chris King, the documentary is interspersed with interviews from three people who knew C.S. Lewis (two attended his lectures), live action sequences features kids who play the Pevensie chlidren, as well as CGI animation related to the story.There is an extra section with biographies of the three people interviewed, an interactive map exploring the world of Narnia, a ""walkthrough"" of the places in Narnia, as well as an interview with a critic of Empire film magazine.Overall, it's a good documentary. The only thing that could have been done better was sound editing. At times, it was hard to understand what Chris King (the narrator) was saying because the background noise (like gunfire and street noise) was simply too loud."
1,baffled,"bought thru eBay. came with no instructions. has now amassed 17 messages. i see no delete button. have enormous difficulty understanding bass voices, men's; women's are easier, even with attached headset. please send me such info. thanx."
1,This phone sucked!,I had to throw it away in 3 months. I guess you get what u pay for. I only paid $10 for it. The headset was very low and the answering machine started crackling in about a month. It was just a waste of time to try and send it back.
1,"Batteries do not hold charge, probably why phone is so cheap",I followed instructions for initial charge of battery but it never charged enough to conduct a call or stop beeping. Crutchfield customer support was quick. They sent me a complete new phone immediately but it has the exact same problem. I am guessing the entire lot has defective batteries causing the clearance pricing. I am planning to buy a different phone as these are not functional at all.
3,"Acceptable information, mediocre mapping to actual test","I passed the first exam (520) with an 87, but the fact that this is the only cram book available for R5 CLS/CLP certification out there left me with little choice but to buy it. The price for the book is expensive for a cram book and the material is taken literally word-for-word from the official Lotus Notes R5 Doc Pack Yellow Books. It seems as though the same three authors of this book wrote the Yellow Books. If you have the Yellow books, don't bother buying this book. Instead go to the Lotus site, jot down the testing objectives, and read the parts of the books that map to the objectives. If you don't have the Yellow Books, then the book is acceptable in pointing out the main points but the material is not very well mapped to the actual test. You better have lots of practice with Domino and read the Notes Help files too(also very similar to the Yellow Books) before taking the test."
3,Organization lacking and factual errors,"I've been working with Lotus Notes/Domino for 4 years. This book is definitely only for experienced admins. Beginners using this book will be frustrated and fail tests. IMO it's a good review of some of the topics, a ""skimming over"" the materials that you need to know. For more intensive study I recommend the red/yellow books and practice tests -- this book's practice tests are useless, and should be in application on a CD, not listed on paper in the book. Also, there were many errors in the book (you don't use HTTP on Domino to let a web browser serve POP mail, as is stated several times in the book, as an example)."
2,disappinted,"You will probably get more confused after using this study guide. The sections are disorganized, and has tons of errors. The sample exams are too easy. I can't believe that this study guide was written by certified people. Some of the material are copied from notes help database."
4,first book for R5 System Admin Exams,"first of all it s bad design, and not included cd. But it contains good information exams.it contains 50 sample questions for each exams.good informations about troubleshootings. it s look like notes redbook and not included exams tips & traps. however not to bad.Table of contents this book:first 5 chapters for exam 520, chap 6-chap 11 for exam 521, chap 12-13 for exam 522."
4,The Leviathan,"This is a fictional trilogy and I found it fantastic!! I bought all three books including ""The Fallen"", ""Leviathan"" and ""Aerie"". The third book wasn't nearly as good as the first two, but was still worth reading. If you like reading about angels -- not the happy, harp-playing angels that play in the clouds, but the fallen angels, and the Nephilim (children of Fallen angels and human women), then these books are for you!"
2,don't buy,"I bought this product at Wal Mart,because I bought a new set of tires and black magic tire shine that I previously used, was not leaving a high enough gloss. This product looks good when applied, but slings all over the car leaving an oily mess. I thought that maybe i didnt let it dry, so the second time I applied hot shine I let it dry over 12 hours before I drove my car, and when I got out, it was slung all over my ride. I proceeded to throw the bottle away. The only reason I'm not giving this 1 star, is the fact that it might not stick to my tires. As previously stated Black magic worked well with my bridgestone's, but not my Michelin's. The tire shine that I find to be the best are tire gels. They have the deepest, wettest, glossiest shine, that I love and they don't sling. All of the gels are good, but eagle one tire gel is my favorite."
4,Gets Them Wet...,This stuff does what you want it to do. Sure it could last longer but for a spray it is amongst the best out there.I have to recommend it.4 stars due to it not lasting forever!
4,good tire product,I started using this and it last longer and has more shine than the product that I was using before
2,Not so good,"Meguiar's products are definitely great products, but i wasnt too happy with this tire spray . It doesnt have the high gloss like some of the other products ive used."
4,works great,i bought this after only using the spray tire foam and to my amazement it works twice as good and lasts 3 times as long .........good stuff and noooooo i wasnt paid for this review lol
5,Great long lasting shine,"If you like black tires , this is it, I love this product cause it works and stays on for a few days, no residue or spots at all, spray it and leave it for a few minutes and wipe, perfect glossy tires every time"
3,"Not Bad, But There Must Be Better Ones","Goes on easily, looks fine right after application. But it doesn't last more than a few days, even if conditions are dry. I'm still looking for a better product.UPDATE: There IS a better one....Meguiar's ""Endurance"" tire shine. It's a little pricier but lasts much longer."
5,100% satisfaction,This is a great product! Easy application and the shine on my tires lasts for days! Definitely would recommend this tire shine for the everyday driver who likes to keep a nice shine on their tires.
3,not really that shiny. and spray nozzle leaks,"i bought it thinking it was shinier than the cheaper ones that come in a spray canister. i was wrong they are pretty much the same. and little annoying things like not properly labeling the nozzle to let you know if your spraying wide or narrow is a pain. you have to spray to know whether the on setting is narrow or wide. this is my first week using it and i gotta tell yah this thing doesn't look like its going to last, even gingerly spraying this on my tire is wasting the spray at an alarming rate. i don't know if its just my bottle that came a little cracked but whenever i spray somehow someway the liquid leaks through the openings and gets all over my hands.other than that, the seller is fast and the package came in good condition."
3,Does Not Last Long,I like Meguiar's products but this spray does not work for long. After about three days the shine was pretty much non-existant. WARNING: Do NOT use it in your driveway!!! It will leave a stain.
2,they suck.,"These are about on par with the regular insoles that came in my airmax(nike). They feel a ""little"" different at first(less then a week for me), but the softer feeling goes away fast. I wear a mens size 15, and these fit inside the show perfectly, without having to trim anything(I should have taken pics of them under the normal insoles, theyre the exact same size, except the nike insoles are a tad thicker in areas). Frankly, I'd suggest something thicker(my wigwam socks I use with them also have extra cushioning on the bottom), these wear out faster then carpet without padding."
3,"Alright, but not great","I am a chef, on my feet from morning to late night. These gel inserts are okay, but not great. First, the only gel in them is on the heel. The rest is some cheap, standard cushioning material. But neither the gel nor the cushioning material are sufficient. They are too thin. They do provide some noticeable softness compared to a standard footbed, but it is not enough to warrant spending money on them."
3,Not the best,I got this as a holiday special on amazon and paid $25 for it. I don't think I would pay much more for it though. The lens got dirty almost right away and it stopped working until I cleaned it off. It works though and does the trick but it's not that wonderful!
4,A really nice portable DVD player,"I have owned this player for over a month now, and have had no problems with it. Battery life is ok too. We took it on a long drive, and my son was able to watch a full Harry Potter movie on a single battery charge. The brightness of the screen was sufficient for watching the movie in a bright van with full sunlight coming in. The audio output of the unit is also impressive for its size."
5,Lovely piece of work,I got this as a deal for $20 and I use it as a regular DVD player at home (connected to my TV) and a portable one when I am on the road. Battery is decent. It can use any DC power (at the appropriate voltage) also due to its design. Only little problem.... remote doesnt have a volume control.. but then many DVD players dont.
1,horrible product and company,"This product did not work properly out of the box, so I sent it to their service center twice, and every time I received the exact same product I originally bought and it still did not work. Never buy anything from this company because I have read very similar reviews everywhere for all of their products."
5,"An excellent 7"" dvd player","After owning this amazing player for a week, I continue to be amazed. It is shock resistant while playing in my car, has more than adequate viewing and listening features as a stand alone player, and outputs excellent video and sound to an external monitor or tv with rca type input jacks. It works well on the removable battery and plays dvds better than my $49 Digix set top player, at least so far. I am very impressed and satisfied, again, at least so far."
2,DVD player defective after 2 months,"I had to return the DVD player after 2 months, b/c it would freeze for a couple of seconds, pause, and make ""chunking/skidding"" sounds. Right when i got it, I put it thru a 12 hr burn in cycle, and it passed. But later on, it started with these symptoms. Pix quality was average, sounds was good. A little bulky and heavy. Then bought the Toshiba 1600. Lighter, and we'll see how that lasts."
1,"Flimsy, short life span","Bought in April, broken by August (stopped reading discs). Even by the standards of these cheap Chinese DVD players, this one was flimsy.The build quality was suspect -- the auto adapter had a very long thin wire instead of thicker, more durable cord. It was impossible to use the car charger with battery backup, so that when you turned off the car, the movie restarted unless you were using battery (and when the battery was dead, you couldn't switch power sources without restarting the disc).I had better luck with the Coby."
5,Easy Cleaning and Versatile,"This is a versatile product that I have used for lasagna, rice krispie bars and umpteen other desserts and baked goods. The cover keeps the air out and the baked good fresh and both the pan and cover last as long as I am careful about how I treat the cover. To maximize the life of your pan, avoid scratches by not using sharp objects and knives on it. Clean up is easy, especially if you do it right away. Clean both sides as soon as you can, making sure to get crumbs and anything stuck between the slides on the cover. Do not put the cover in the oven, microwave, or deep-dry it in the dishwasher... the heat will make it more susceptible to breaking in a fall once dry. Your pan and cover should last many years if you are careful with these few simple, basic things."
3,dont like the lid,"just got it, over all we are happy with it but I dont like the lid it slides to lock in and doesnt stay locked very well also this makes it difficult to clean, otherwise, so far so good."
2,Broken locks,"I bought the little woman the pan like this with the carry handle on the locking lid because she bakes cakes sometimes for potlucks at work and I thought this would help her carry the cakes into work from the car. The first time that she used it to carry a cake to one of the potlucks at work, the lid popped off and the cake hit the floor. One of the sliding locks released by itself. Before leaving the house I checked it myself to see if lid locked correctly, and it seemed fine. Even now, around the home, we have used the locking lid but when you unlock the slides, the locks come out of the slots into your hand. As a baking pan itself, it is great. Just don't trust the locking lid that comes with it."
3,"'Wilton Excelle Elite' pan -very good, the pan's cover-not so good.","First, I have to say that the ""Wilton Excelle Elite-9' x 13' cake pan has been great. It bakes evenly, has the best nonstick coating Ihave seen, and I love the handles on the edge of the pan. It's another example of Wilton's much better than average bakeware. However, the cakepan's plastic cover is another story. The first one I received was broken and had to be returned for refund. The cover for the other pan, whick has slider-push in to lock on pan-mechanism, has little plastic tabs that when pushed in over the rolled metal edge of pan, is ssupposed to lock the lid in place. I have discovered that where the tabs snap lock, they also chip away at the nonstick coating, a place for corrosion to start. A pan of this quality should have a better cover."
4,Great Product!,"I love that I can bake right in the pan and then use the lid to cover what I made. I just wish the cover sealed more tight around the edges of the pan, like Tupperware or Rubbermaid. Overall a great product though."
3,Not one of Simak's best,"The premise is interesting, but for me this story was somewhat disturbing, because the way people reacted to the situations in the story weren't realistic at all. The ending will leave you very disappointed. Worth reading only if you're a big Simak fan."
5,froze ony,"hey boi dis sh*t right chea off da chain man. dat boi froze ony put it down fa the d-town.(dallas,texas). dis cd crunk as hell boi ya need to get it soon as possible pimp. da best songs is 1,2,4,9,10, and 14."
2,Impossible to watch ; SHLOCK,"Wolf Creek is a familiar enough story line done many times by more skillfull and much more creative people.If violence for the sake of violence is your bag and dismemberment gives you a thrill. Than by all means enjoy this SHLOCK in your desert hideway.I will say this for the first half of the movie there are great views of the Australiain Outback. The acting is better than average, but nothing can overcome the movies excesses."
1,"One of the worst ""scary"" movies...EVER!","This is, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. The plot was contrived and it was not scary at all. It did not even scare my girlfriend, who is afraid of the weakest scary movies. I would rank it a 1 out of 10 on the scary movie scale and a 2.5 out of 10 on the overall movie scale. It was definitely a big waste of time. I would only watch it again if I was paid."
2,last third works,"But that's about it. The people you're supposed to care about come across as dingalings, so there really isn't anyone to give a damn about.Spoiler: At some point, after the two chicks have gotten away from the killer's bloody grasp, one of the chicks decides they absolutely must have a car, and returns to the psycho's lair.Huh? Wait a minute. There is no way this would have happened in real life. They (pretty much) lost me right there.John Jarret's performance is pretty solid, but this was hardly enough to keep me involved.The behind the scenes was quite dull.I wanted the flick to work. Glad I borrowed it from a friend, instead of having spent money to buy it."
2,so so,"I thought this movie could have been a lot better.. it had so much potential because the villain was played so well. Basically there's 3 people and they have their car broken down at wolf creek and some guy comes along to help fix it.. but he puts spikes their drinks and when they fall asleep tie them up and take them as his prisoners of torture. He really tortures one of them well, by aiming his rifle at her and making her scared for her life. The only thing I didn't like was that he didn't have any confrontation with the only male prisoner of his.. which would have been a lot funner to watch than some guy torturing 2 defenseless women..."
4,JUST A HEAD ON A STICK.....,I LOVED THIS MOVIE AND IM A HARD ONE TO PLEASE WHEN IT COMES TO HORROR....A+++++++
1,i could have made this a much better movie,"my idea would have solved 2 of the 3 huge problems.....as we see the vacationers oooing and aahing the scenery,we are shown the bad guy torturing some saps.cut back to more oogling then again back to the maniac.go like this until their paths cross then BOOM !!!!!!!!!!! this takes care of the borringassed get to know you beginning(was an hour really needed for that lameassed attempt at charactor development?!?!?!?).this also takes care of the puny body count(2.......TWO ?!?!?!?!?!?!? i cant remember the last ''horror'' movie with a more pathetic body count).how did you people survive watching an hour worth of yapping ?!?!?!?!?!? i agree with one of the kids when he/she typed the better tagline would ''buy ticket and wait an hour before entering''......zzzzzzzzzzzzz"
2,BOREING!!!!!!,"I'm sorry I paid $10 to go see this film, it's to slow to begin with and to predictable. it was said that it would scary like ""TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE"" not true! how ever it is worth renting this flick, but dont go bragging about and don't buy it either."
1,Just Like every other new Horror Movie......,"The movie Wolf Creek lacks in the horror category, just like 99.9% of all the new ""horror"" movies. There is no scare. Just gore. I am a horror movie fan, of the originals, any thing after the late 80's early 90's, just about a waste of time.( A few exceptions.) No good story plot, and no reason to watch. I usually shut these new movies off, including this one, in about 10 minutes or less."
4,"Not a bad movie, if you know a little about what has happened in Australia","Wolf Creek is a low budget film but I think that goes a long way to hooking you into the events.Being Australian I would never backpack across Australia and hearing the stories of the number of backpackers who go missing every year adds such a realisation to the film.Ivan Milat was jailed in 1998 for life for the murder of 7 backpackers whose bodies were found in the Belanglo State Forest outside Sydney.Bradley John Murdoch was found guilty in December 2005 for the kidnapping of Joanne Lees and Peter Falconio (English backpackers) and the murder of Peter Falconio.Watch this movie together with just these two events in mind and you'll get a real feeling of what the horror is all about.Greg McLean does a great job of keeping the situation real. Can't wait to see his next instalment ""Rogue""."
5,EXCELLENT HORROR FILM !,"Greg McLean's ""Wolf Creek"" is a masterful addition to the backwoods horror genre. Destine for horror greatness & much more factual than Tobe Hooper's 1974 landmark horror film ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" wich is loooosely based on ""the ghoul of plainfeild"" Ed Gein. McLean's film is about one (mostly real) incident in wich a man named Ivan Robert Milat aka ""The Wolf Creek Killer"" or ""The Back Pack Killer"" who was found guilty of killing 7+ back packer's between 1989-92 in aultralia's back woods in & around a national park called wolfcreek this is just one of the stories & it is truly scary! enjoy!"
1,urrgh,"This movie has no plot. Most of it has nothing to do with the story line, and are totally irrelevant. It is among the worst horror movies, comparable to the Blair Witch Project. The ridiculous thing is that the BWP was a fake but made people believe it was real; while this one, supposedly based on a true story, was by no means realistic. Whoever the critic was who said it was one of the best ever made must be nuts. Don't waste your money."
3,Plot Full of holes,"Four plot holes where you have to suspend belief making it less impactful.1. you don't trust a creepy guy - especially after hours being towed2.If you shoot the killer and thereby incompasitate him - you kill him in self-defense ie. to survive3.If you get away - you dont go back - even if it means you die in the outback or wherever - it has to believable.4. The Jason factor - throw -back to the 80's slasher movies - the killer ""magically"" appears in the car she starts in order to escape but how did he get in there- she was in the garage firstConclusion : Work harder Hollywood"
1,I cant believe these reviews. R U friggin kidding me?,"Low budget, but beautifly shot, ok I'll give you that. The character build at the beginning was a welcome change, but 40 mins of waiting, way too much. The climax of the film was [...], this movie was suppose to be gut wrenching, nope, no chase, no suspense. Girl tortured for a few minutes, car blows up, girl gets away, girl comes back, girl paralyzed, girl gets shot, guy escapes easily, killer walks, roll the credits. Sorry for the spoilers, but that is the whole movie and no details are left out. Simply pathetic. I'm sorry but I must of missed something somewhere. Worst movie I've watched in years"
1,What the HELL?,"I'm in disbelief about how many people are raving about this movie. Quite frankly, this movie deserves no stars not even 1. I thought it was absolutely terrible. For one thing, let me just say, for the first hour NOTHING! happens. It doesn't pick up at all until almost the end, and even then it's just mediocre at best. I was nodding off in the theatre waiting for some action and NOTHING! happened. There are only 4 people in the entire movie 1 being the killer and 3 being the victims. It had no point or reasoning behind it. It followed every other slasher/stalker movie cliche in the teen horror genre even though it's suppose to be based on true events. Needless to say, I felt robbed, disappointed, and I wasted an hour and 45 minutes of my life."
1,THE FIVE STAR REVIEWERS ARE ALL LIARS!!!!,"Where do I begin? This movie was p-a-i-n-f-u-l-l-y BORING!!! I want my two hours back. I am a huge horror fan, but this film is just NOT good! People actually compare this to Texas Chainsaw Massacre? Trust me, there is no comparison. TCM is an outstanding film, but this movie is a piece of crap. I WILL NEVER AGAIN LISTEN TO REVIEWERS WHICH IS WHY I RENTED THIS!!! Trust me, do not believe them. If I can save someone from this movie, then writing this was worth it!"
3,Disturbing but not great,"The beginning is similar to another low budget film - Open Water, in the sense that it seems obligatory and disjointed, rather than the character introduction it's intended to be. Just as with Open Water you don't feel you meet the characters until they are faced with peril. The remaining 3/4 of the film is better as it plays on the believeble fears of three young people, faced with the uncertainty of a foreign, isolated environment, subject to local prejudice and jealousy. Although predictable, the film has a genuineness to it that will caputure the interest of most horror fans. Two people did walk out during my viewing, but other than one scene, the violence is not inordinate."
2,whats wrong with hollywood?,"i really looked forward to seeing this movie since its based on true events..but after it was done..i totally changed my mind and now think to myself what kind of people make a movie only about a couple kids being horribly tortured, and end up dying (except one). i was hoping that there would be a twist in the ending or sumthing, but no, the whole movie was just filmed on only torture..and whats really sick, is this really happened to some people, and now they sell it for us to be ""entertained"", i think that is pretty freakin sick. i love horror movies, but this film was pointless and should never been made. Im sure that the girls who died wouldnt like knowing there are people out there just staring at there deaths and torture. Where are the good horror films? BRING BACK STUFF THE THE EXORCIST!!!ALTHO, the only reason i gave it 2 stars, is yes, John Jarret's acting was GREAT, but thats not a reason to see this, not at all."
1,Wow...,"... This is one of the worst movies I think I've ever seen. Maybe it just wasn't my kind of film, but I saw it in theaters close to when it came out and I can't think of a movie I liked less. Perhaps it was because my boyfriend, for some reason, took me to see it because he somehow thought it was a werewolf movie. Or maybe it was because nothing happened until about an hour or more through the movie. Half the people in the theater walked out 1/3 of the way through, and I wish I had done the same.Seriously... very lame."
2,"1 star for scenery, 1 for acting","I know there is an audience for this, which thoroughly depresses me. In any case, this film offers an hour of amazing shots of Australia's outback, interspersed with some nominal back story and character development. Then a series of scenes of women being brutalized while the sole male victim is off-screen, to appear later as a possible suspect. The sole story arc is that 3 people go on a trip, then the women get tortured(and worse). Oh yeah, there are also a few mind-numbingly bad choices made by the women which allows for what happens to them. Kind of felt like the directors way of saying ""Well you shouldn't have been DRESSED that way"", but that could just be me. I hate it when a film acts like the women asked for their fate by making choices that, in real life, women wouldn't make. Just kind of left me depressed about the future of horror films, but the acting was great. So were the shots of the landscape. There you have it."
4,Effective horror film,"This movie really does nothing original, but it is definitely an effective horror movie. It starts with more character development than we see in the 'traditional' horror movies, and as a result, it is not a typical 'in your face' type of movie. The acting was excellent, and the suspense was palpable throughout the last half of the movie. I admit, the ending left much to be desired, but overall, I found this movie to be disturbing.I noticed that many reviewers criticize this movie for not having as much gore as other horror movies - If you are the type that equates gore with horror, then this movie is probably not for you."
4,Achieves the Rare Feat in Horror Films,"What I found unique about this film is that you actually do care about the characters. In the usual slasher fare, the characters are so thinly written because they're really existing to be carved up by the slasher-du-jour.In this one, however, they spend a good deal of time (some here complain too much) letting you get to know the characters before they encounter one of the most disturbing killers in recent film memory.Which makes the movie scary in a way that most aren't, because you don't want to see any harm to come to them. I was truly disturbed watching this film. The violence is sudden and unforgiving, and not at all glamorized.The handheld and DV camera work gave it a real you-are-there quality, and the actors were outstanding. Plus the shots of Australia were beautiful, especially the outback.But this is certainly NOT a popcorn, LOL slasher flick. If you thought a movie like ""Hostel"" was creepy, this is right up your alley."
4,and you think you have something to whinge about,"At last an Aussie horror movie to be proud of,and sum good oneliners ,throwen in for laughs ,based on real events in this country about 15 years ago which make it all the more chillingJohn Jarratt deserves to stand beside the best for his performance ,always the person you least expect, I don't know if you would show this as a welcome to the great outdoors , only if you wanted to get away forever,PS in real life the locals are very friendly and proud of their tourtist attraction , as they should be to"
1,One of the WORST horror movies out there,"Wolf Creek has to be one of the worst horror movie I have ever seen. First of all, the movie starts out so slow. Then when the ""horror"" part of this so called horror movie finally starts, you are suddenly reminded why movies such as ""Scream"" did so well in the box office (to poke fun at movies such as Wolf Creek). In so many scenes I kept hearing myself say things like, ""run run stupid...no not there...just keep quiet..don't go there..don't get back on the road, he'll just pick you up."" At the end this movie failed miserable. And to top it off, its claim of being ""based on a true story"" has no merit. Don't waste your time."
1,DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE,This movie is so doublecrossed that when you watch the movie you are left dumbfounded.i watched this coming home from the holidays.i heard about the release in australia a while back and thinking this movie was a pysche 101 thriller.i was wrong nothing like seeing a movie so distasteful you have to puke.come on there are the easy n go dialogue that someone so ingenius wouldnt stand tall.this was based on a true story but the story itself doesnt explain the whole ordeal.i hate critics for that matter and sitting my rear end in a movie that was this bad and misleading got me pissed.1/10 i give this movie that bad and just disgusing.
2,lame,"From the box, this looks like a good horror movie, but it's not. It's slow, and there are no really scary scenes. It's creepy, but nothing at all like the Blair Witch Project.If you're looking for a good newer horror movie, don't waste your money on this movie. Get House of Wax or Hostel instead."
5,Credit where credit is due,"This movie was, how should I put it...terrible! What really got me interested was that it implied that it was based on real events. Where I grew up, this usually means that it actually happened. It turned out this is not the case after I did a little bit of home work.However, there is one redeeming quality to this film [should I even call it that?]: the head on a stick. I don't know what the head on a stick is, and I am fairly certain that I won't ever see it again. For a brief second, though, head on a stick was pure joy, and really captured the audience here. For that I give the movie five stars; without head on a stick this film wouldn't be worth the plastic it was burned on."
1,Not scary I think Hostel is way better!,I know a lot of people didn't like Hostel but I liked Hostel a lot. I started to walk out of the theater for Wolf Creek. It wasn't that scary to me. If you guys hadn't seen Hostel yet ignore the bad reviews. It's a great horror flick and a must see. Do not see Wolf Creek! Wait till it comes on cable. Don't waste your money!
3,horror is going down hill fast!!!!,"This movie is super slow!!! you should skip the first hour of this movie, it's boring and pointless. The last 45 min's or so is not too bad. I'M A HUGE HORROR FAN AND NOTHING COMING OUT THESE DAYS CAN COMPARE TO "" THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE ""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!! Most people that know nothing about true horror will love this.......or give it a great review...."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"I bought this movie, anticipating it to be like ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", and instead, I got a movie that bored me. I bought the unrated version, which is over an hour and a half long. It took about 52 minutes before anything remotely tense or scary happened. I'll save you the trouble: in skipping the first 52 minutes, all you'll see are the three hikers partying, renting a car, sleeping, hiking, and finding their car broken down. While the action of the hikers being hunted down was in itself intense at times, it just didn't hold me like ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" did."
2,THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!,I hated this movie. I was forced th watch it with my friends one night and was bored out of my life. You minus well just skipp to the last 30 mins because there is no suspenese what so ever until the end. If you like these kind of realistic movies I would recomend to see High Tension. Its avery similar film that has lots of suspense and keeps you entertain. Overall dont waste your time on this movie.
2,EXTREMELY Overrated,"After reading all the great reviews about this movie, I rented it on DVD. What a waste! Wolf Creek has everything a bad horror movie should have in it: potential victims making every mistake in the book so that they are even easier targets for the psycho killer, shallow characters, no background story and an aimless plot. Even the title is ridiculous, since the tourist spot known as Wolf Creek is only featured for about 5 minutes out of the entire movie.The only redeeming quality about it is that it shows some great Australian scenery, but this is no horror film. I mean, even after the major shift in personality, the villain is still pretty likable and not at all credible.I wouldn't recommend it, especially if you like your horror to really scare you. Also, it does nothing for the genre."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"The people who gave this movie good reviews must have been on crack! The plot was horrible. The events that the writer gave the actors to do were stupid. Only one of the victims had any sense of survival. When and if you watch it you will understand what I mean. Before anything starts to happen the movie is already 1 hour into its boring plot.The only part that I feel sorry about is that this happened to this group of people. I am even more sorry that this wasted 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life.The movie had no horror or suspence. Some how the ""VILLIAN"" has an internal GPS configured into his brain. I actually recommend everyone to watch this movie so we can put a stop to movies made by mediocre writers and directors."
2,Senseless Violence,"I thought this movie would be a rockin' horror flick. Yet, it was low-budget, clearly, and had a very hollow plot. If you like unexplained violence, but it."
3,so so,"I dont know, I just dont get it. As far as the characters go, yea we relate to them. We get a bit drawn in to their experience. But as far as the horror goes, what horror? I was not the least bit disturbed by any of it. To me, it was fairly predictable. Maybe some twists in some spots, but overall, predictable. C'mon, backwood hick redneck comes to fix your car in the middle of the desert, clear out of nowhere. O yea, no surprise there. Been there, done that. Most of the time, everyones crying,running and hiding. I gave it 3 stars not because its a horror flick, but because the acting was decent. However, I dont understand how everybody is saying how they were ""on the edge of their seat"" with this film. I was dissapointed. With all of the hype this movie got, I expected some clever twists and turns, uncharacteristic of typical slasher movies. Instead, we got a half-acted drawn out generic slasher."
2,Solid low budget horror,"I agree with the reviewer who summed this up as solid low budget horror. Cassandra Magrath's character Liz receives the most screen time and is in many ways the protagonist. Yes it's been praised by the critics for its relative realism compared to other horror movies, and knowing very little about Australia this introduced me a bit to the beautiful landscape and gave me a sense of the vastness of the ""outback.""What all of this adds to the film beyond giving it good reviews is hard to gauge. You might feel emotionally worse after this than other slashers. You identify a bit more than usual with the victims although their questionable actions during the action sequences will jeopardize this for some viewers. In the final estimation a movie like this one depicting horror in the Australian outback was overdue for production given the slew of serial murders in Australia, and it just happened to be Wolf Creek that comes to fill the role."
4,"OMG, OMG, OMG","This movie will freak you out and I don't scare easily. I watch most of the things that my friends won't. I think the hardest part is when I realized that someone actually went through this. After I watched this movie, I was telling my husband that I want AAA roadside assistance ordered immediately and cell phone chargers in every car. There is no way I want help from any ""kind stranger"". That look he gave Ben was really something. I had to stop the movie to prep myself for what he was about to do to Lizzie. Very scary and suspenseful film."
4,Successfully unpleasant.,"A horror film, especially one based on true events, is expected to be tragic. Wolf Creek contains some real tragedy and horror. Unlike a lot of typical horror movies, the first half of the movie travels along a benign adventure experienced by three young people just looking for a peaceful vacation. Midway, the film takes a creepy turn that just gets creepier and creepier until it bursts into horror flames. There is fright power in this film. And the ending, also unconventional for a horror movie, left me guessing a bit about the entire premise of the movie. Great plot and execution. Production, editing, writing and acting were great. Some may feel the first half of the movie drags since it contains no 'horror' scenes. I look at it like the build-up to a sneeze. The outcome is inevitable. That makes the horror segments at the second half of the movie that much more shocking and 'horrible.'"
3,Beautiful movie. Absolutely horrifying.,"This movie is based on true events. If I explained how it is not totally accurate, I would give away too much of the movie.Three young people -- two girls and a guy -- make a cross-counrty trek to Wolf Creek Meteorite Crater in Australia -- a million miles from anywhere inhabited. They have car trouble at the crater and get stuck overnight. The guy makes jokes about aliens.They are helped by a friendly, rough pioneer type. All h*** breaks loose.This is one of the most upsetting and gory movies I've seen. Shocking midway through with a surprising and unsettling, true epilogue.While I've always wanted to visit Australia, based on this movie if I ever get there, I won't be journeying to Wolf Creek."
1,STUPID,"I actually paid to see this movie... that's what horrifying. Slow moving, nothing interesting happening for what seemed like hours. It had no plot. Just another ""lost and in the middle of nowhere"" movie. I mean get a new story line. Preferably a good one next time. So many rip off cheaply made horror films out right now. (And I'm not saying cheaply made horror films are always awful but this one really was.)So don't waste your time or money..."
2,Disappointing,"This movie was hyped as being very scary and disturbing, but it wasn't much of either. Development went on way too long, and there were few suprises once the action started (other than I was suprised how lame it turned out to be). As a fan of horror, I found it rather predictable with only a few brief clips of anything remotely ""terrifying""."
4,Wolf Creek,"This film is pretty gorey. There is plenty of blood, guts and suffering.I reccomend this film to anyone who likes true stories about serial killers. This is an excellent film, both dark, and at times painful to watch the killer's sadistic ways he goes about torturing his victums...And what's also scarry is that fact that they have never been able to catch this guy who is doing all of these terrible things. And That is really scarry to know that there is a possibility that he could still be out there somewhere...This film was well worth the money."
1,SNORE...SNORE...SNORE,THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST BORING SNORE FESTS OF A MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN...I BET THE ACTORS KILLED THEMSELVES FROM THE BORDOM...OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BORING... SNORE FEST
3,Good movie for a restful evening,"This movie, Shadows in the Sun was a little over the top but enjoyable and relaxing to watch. Pretty scenery."
4,Old inspires new,Nice movie ... a little bit of a hasty plot ... nice story-line ... solid performances ... story of a struggling novelist who meets an old and famous writer who has stopped writing ... and how they inspire one another to start writing
5,I was forced to watch this movie on a transcontinental flight.,"This is a rare movie that goes beyond its superb acting, engaging plot, and beautiful setting to explore deep philosophical issues: What is creativity? What makes a writer great? Why are some people compelled to write? Why would a great writer stop writing? It is an immensely enjoyable and engaging movie. As someone who has spent parts of two recent summers in a small village in Tuscany, I was immensely impressed at how well the movie captured the spirit of one of the most magical places on earth. It is one of those rare movies that I will want to watch again and maybe again."
1,NOT a family movie,"NOT a family movie. Did not watch much. Inuendo, bad language, bizarre behavior...not a fan. The plot had so much potential & they ruined it. Don't waste your money!"
4,Amazon Instant Video,it is wonderful to be able to access these movies. My husband and I don't have cable and Amazon has an excellent selection of movies.
2,"trite plot, bad acting, *stunning scenery*","Gorgeous Tuscan landscape. Doesn't get better. So if you want to see the scenery, then watch the movie. I'm all for chick flicks, and this surely is one. But the lead character was never compelling, the dramatic scenes forced. The lines unbearably tedious. Bad acting, bad writing, great scenery."
2,Italy looks good,"One and a quarter stars for Italy, the remaining three quarters for Keitel. You might really enjoy this movie if you think Somerset Maugham is a good name for a beach cottage, that Oprah is smartly entertaining, and that things are going swimmingly well in DC where we are under strong and true leadership, Otherwise I think you should consider watching a good movie, something like ""This Property is Condemned."" This Property is Condemned has weak bookends but it also has two things that this film lacked; a real story and good acting. You should especially avoid this movie if you are prone to think about the films that you have watched; the more you think about this one, the more you will dislike it. I found it superficial."
5,"Fresh, utterly charming, exquisitely performed ---","Gragnani apparently wrote little or little has survived, and certainly little is heard. What a crying shame! This lovely collection belongs in the listeners library of anyone who needs a break from a steady diet of acknowledged, and lets face it, overplayed masters. Here are graceful and vital melodies skillfully assigned to winning combinations of instruments, I guarantee you, winningly played. Try this if you need a change of pace (and any friend in earshot will thank you for the introduction)."
4,Great characters - great romantic hero,"I loved the hero of this book. He was just so darn nice. He was one of the only heros of a romance novel I have read so far who actually was worried about getting the heroine pregnant. They usually fooling around like crazy and then are shocked when a baby arrives. He was crazy about the heroine and really went for her. The passion was there and the relationship was real. Also, the characters were well protrayed. I could really imagine both of them in my mind, they weren't the usual cookie cutter types. It was my first Judith Ivory and not my last."
3,This had potential...but didnt live up to it.....,"""The Indiscretion"" was an ok book...when I first read the back, I was excited to read it..I love a book where two people get stuck together....this story started out well and was fast paced, however, after they got back to civilization, the whole thing just fell flat. The ending was too wordy and I found that there were a few loose ends that could have used tying up..such as Liddy's relationship with Rose. All in all not awful, but not fantastic either."
3,Very average historical romance,"I listened to this book on audio which is often a better experience than reading because many of the voice actors are so talented. They can put emotions, accents, and intrigue into otherwise mundane prose. I found this book to be ""just average"" in all categories: characterization, storyline, emotion, voice acting, etc. etc. Sam is certainly a worthy hero, but his self-depreciation was almost annoying. He is extremely intelligent and competent and was supposedly the 2nd wealthiest man in America at the time of this story! Lydia is the typical heroine - sassy, naive, etc.I didn't dislike this book, but I have read so many that are much better that I don't think it deserves more than 3 to 3.5 stars."
3,The Indiscretion,"I have read all of Judith Ivory's books and have not been able to put them down,all except this one. It is well written and gets off to a good start, but somewhere along the middle of the story I kind of lost interest. The story seemed too predictable, although Sam Cody was a likeable guy.In my opinion,her previous books, Beast, Sleeping Beauty and The Proposition(my personal favorite) were much better."
3,English lady meets Texas cowboy.,"When Lady Lydia Bedford-Browne set out on a adventure in Texas, she didn't think it would be the adventure of her life. The straight-laced English woman proved she could take a chance on her life, but she couldn't take a chance on love. Sam Cody was the only other passenger on her coach when it ran into a terrible accident. Though they had been stranded, the two decided to do something about it--but what could they do in the middle of nowhere? The contrasts here between Texas man and English woman are very striking here, but the characterizations go no further than that. Sexual tension, though well-written, seems to take over the story and to cheapen the relationship these characters could have had. The adventure, however, is interesting and can satisfy a reader's curiosity."
3,A Library Pick !,"The Indiscretion by Judith Ivory takes placed in England in 1899. Lady Lydia takes off on her own for a three hour trip on stage coach. In the old stage coach is drunk American who stood up his fiance for the second time. This novel had some unique storylines. I did find myself skimming - just not my favorite.If you enjoy this genre I would suggest What an Earl Wants by Shirley Karr, Secrets of a Duchess by Kaitlin O'Riley and A Lady At Last ( by Brenda Joyce."
1,Silly....A complete waste of time.,"Let me start out by saying that I am sick to death of cowboys. However, since Ms. Ivory's last several books have been high on my list I decided to give it a try and continue reading. Sad to say the story sputtered along with silly dialogue between Lydia and Cowboy Sam. I am sorry to say this book lacks the usual lyrical dialogue that Ms. Ivory's book are famous for."
2,Too Bulky,A bit too bulky to fit inside a sneaker. Not entiely appropriate for the more narrow foot of a woman
4,good but a tight fit,this product works very well but is a tight fit... I would recommend going up a size.
5,MUST,I THINK IT WOULD BE A BENEFIT TO EVERYONE INCLUDING THEREADER TO READ THIS BOOK. I AM NOT MUCH ON MESSAGES BUTTHIS ONE WILL MAKE YOU THINK WILL KEEPING YOU DEEPLYENGROSSED. THAT IS SAYING A LOT BECAUSE I'M A HARD GUYTO CAPTURE.GENE ADDINGTON
5,Really awesome book,I had read some reviews on this book and decided to buy it. Best Perches I Ever Made!! It has a very simple style that's also for beginners as well as others. Me and my nieces love this book.
5,best shampoo for our dog,We have tried a lot of different pet shampoos and this one is the best we have found for our dog's dry skin.
2,Completely Out Of Character,"Unlike the rest of the reviews here, this one isn't exactly a glowing recommendation. I found most of the principles in the story completely out of character with their established personalities. In the series, you were left with the impression that Picard was extremely upset with Ro Laren's betrayal, yet in the book, it's hardly even mentioned at all. Another point, the author does a good job of describing federation prisoners suffering thoroughly at the hands of the Jem Hadar and Cardassians while doing slave labor, while the main character completely forgets them at the end to start his own life, no longer caring about his suffering comrades who are still prisoners. He even forgets about his best friend who helped him get through the tough times. No, I was completely let down. The noble Picard acting like the brash young Captain Kirk threw me for a loop also."
2,"Worse than the ""Behind the Lines""","Already wary of John Vornholt's writing, I was hoping this would change my mind...I was wrong. There is little or no action until the very end, and I was hoping it would be epic space battles, which I got from the cover. But the Enterprise is stuck in a starbase, and all the crew does is try to help some pathetic commander. And when they do finally show up, it's too obvious, and it was like an after-thought to add the rest of the crew in the story. The only two characters who really shined were Hasmek and Geordi, since they weren't used that much, and Vornholt couldn't screw them up. The whole Badlands part is pointless. I suggest to anybody that you read the Deep Space Nine series, because they're awesome in comparison. A war fits nicely into the Deep Space Nine universe, not The Next Generation universe."
4,Good conclusion to book 1.,"This book concluded book 1. very nicely, I must say. As did book 1., this book moved smoothly. It also a couple plot twists that may not be expected."
5,"Ever Constant, Ever Sure","I have been listening to Luke Garrett since I was a baby and I can recognize his voice anywhere. He is the best singer I know. His songs have words that are so easy to understand and that are real and sometimes they make me cry. I know my mom and dad get all excited when they listen to him. ""As if I Were the only one to love"" is my favorite because that's just what God makes me feel like."
2,Very average,"My experience is that it is not made very well for potenial snags, as earely in my use of the mit I caught it on a fender edge while washing the car and it frayed, and this has continued to occur; one does not expect a product such as this to start falling apart as it has."
1,Snag,"This hooks on ever piece of trim or gap on the car and then unravels. Only good for washing the wheels, don't let it touch the car finish or you'll be left blue string snagged everywhere."
2,Not the best,"Bought this mitt thinking it would be a great addition to my car care kit. It works ok but I suspect it won't last long. After 3 washes, it's already deteriorating. The ""loops"" that make up the mitt wash surface catch on the edges of the car and pull out creating long lengths of the loop product. Not well made and not the best of designs. Would not recommend this product. There are better options."
3,Not Quite Proper,"Normally I am a big fan of Proper Records. They put together great single, double and 4 disc sets at rediculously cheap prices. The recordings are meticulously mastered etc... That said, this is the weakest Proper purchase I've ever made. The second disc has most of the hits you would be looking for from Fats, but they are not the original recordings. Instead they are live versions. Some of them are okay, but a lot of them really are just plane bad. The first disc, on the other hand is wonderful- a great collection surveying his early years. So be careful. If you are looking to go a little deeper than Fats Domino's greatest hits, but you also want them too, I'd look elsewhere."
4,Elvis fans....Attention,"An absolute ""must have"" for any Elvis fan. Don't be left on the outside of this one!"
1,not his best friend,sunny west is a joke he and his brother back stabed elvis and he never got over it. his best friend joe e knows the truth.
3,Elvis:close up and personal.,"A bit disappointed with this dvd, most of what was being said, has already been said before, not really worth the money - sorry."
4,Inspiring lady!,"Even though I am not a hat lover this book was interesting because it captured Norma's spirit - her ability to overcome obstacles, her great determination and drive, and her dream of creating a museum for her beloved hats. I'm looking forward to hearing more of her achievements."
5,Hat's off,"This book captures ""The Joy of Hats"" and provides an accurate chronicle of the establishment of a unique millinery enterprise."
3,Big Boy,"Essentially I only bought this CD for 2 songs - Big Boy and Fill Er Up which were heard in the 1977 movie ROLLERCOASTER, but were not included on the soundtrack album. Sparks performed the songs in the movie at what is now Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, CA.I'm not really a Sparks fan and none of the other songs appealed to me."
4,"THIS IS NOT A NEW ""PRISONER"" NOVEL","but is a reprint of the work first published in the early 80's. In my opinion, of the three original Prisoner novels that were published, this is the best and the only one that captures the feel of the television series on paper."
1,CHEAP!!! VERY CHEAP!!!,This item claims to be a pendant. well i received it on the cheap rope its shown on and it looks like a keychain not a necklace!
5,"I'm only a weekend shooter, and.........","I thought I handled my rifle well. After viewing and practicing the concepts in this video, I'm now even a better, safer, more accurate, and more confident rifleman. Thank You Garret."
5,EXCELLENT,"This is a fantastic recording. I bought it used from Modern guy and 3 days later I had it with me. Excellent, excellent. Both, the CD and the service provider."
5,"b-tribe is more than 5 stars, never boring!","We use the music in our SAUNA & RELAX Center for many months!!!And still, almost every time we get that same question, where did you get this fine music???Here where I live almost nobody (+99%) do not known B-Tribe or had ever heard of it!It's the top, better than so many boring new-age music...we listen to this music every day and still we never said it's to much now let get something different now. People who want a top album, please buy this stuff (even blind)you never get regrets! 5 stars is not enough. Btw the album Tribe V is one of the best 5 albums, believe me it's super!!!"
5,Orgasmic!,"O, I am a b-tribe fan I am! What a fabulous, intense, spiritual journey that is even, at times, orgasmic: which for me is a spiritual experience, to be sure! The haunting tones, the vibrant voices, the light that shines through the vibrations of the beat, yes, these people know how to create an atmosphere of love, trust, beauty, warmth. My favorite remains ""Suave, Suave,"" but this is a great follow-up. Frankly, we have them all, and with good reason. In a time when we need peace more than ever, ""Spiritual, Spiritual"" reminds us what peace - and joy - feels like. Get yours today."
2,Disappointment,"I should have listened to the previous reviews I read. The CD is not of the same quality as Fiesta Fatal and Sensual. If you want to buy a fantastic CD buy those two. Other great suggestions Buddha Bar collections and Chill Out In Paris CDs.After my disappointment, I will now take these reviews more seriously."
1,Oh how the mighty have fallen,After the fantastic Sensual album this group has muddled through the last two release. Seemingly all direction is lost. This latest nightmare can be heard in the elevators at the Marriott. I am not sure what creative person left but they are long gone. Bummer!
1,oh how the mighty have fallen,Hard to believe the creators of the fantastic Sensual album have fallen to this level. The last two releases have been heard in your local Marriott elevator. WHat a shame. I don't know what creative force left this band but they are long gone. Bummer
1,CANNOT BELIEVE I PURCHASED THIS CD!,Enjoyed all B-Tribe cd's except this one! What happened??? It is so bad i decided to sell it here on Amazon! They need to go back to their formula and maybe re-release this cd!
5,Fantastic Photos,This book was an oversized hardback book that I have placed on my coffee table for others to enjoy. The photos of the Appalachian Wilderness are fantastic. The commentary by Edward Abbey made me think about our Great Smoky Mountains. I loved the book and many visitors have asked me about it.
2,"$89.99 retail, LIE, just to get your attention!","As soon as I got this set out of the package I knew it, they look nice but they're very light, they feel cheap. we'll see how long they will last. I did some research and they're $ 9.99 everywhere. The $89.99 sticker is a scam"
4,"Good DVD, but wish I would have bought a different one","I enjoyed watching but I didn't learn too much new. I didn't realize that most of what she was talking about in the DVD was stuff I had already explored on my own. For the things I was looking to learn more about(dyeing), she just touched on without much extra explanation. I did also learn from the comb demo as I had never seen those live only drawings. Now I want to buy some wool combs. I did enjoy her joyful approach to spinning and appreciate that as I also love spinning. I was also a bit annoyed that a week after I watched my DVD Interweave had a 40% off sale on this same DVD, sigh. Anyway, if you are a complete beginner, get it!"
5,The visual experience by words,"Some of the Poems in Billboard in the Clouds show me the moment in daily life with sharp, simple and sensitive observation. I enjoyed having the visual experiences by her words."
5,Dance to Pan's music,"This book was everything I wanted it to be. An English village returns to the more natural world of Pan worship, including the Vicar, whose point of view the story follows. He worries about the 'piping' music that had begun to play over the valley, but no one else seems to care, or properly notice what the problem is. He goes to visit his Bishop but they think he just needs a holiday. He ends up meeting a nomadic hermit who appears to understand what he is on about - and the vicar finds himself relying on someone he never thought he would. Nothing works as he plans, but the village enters a world of their own, something deep and enticing - not unlike the chapter in Wind in the Willows - 'Piper at the Gates of Dawn' - Dunsany describes the twilight, landscape and traditions of the quiet village in beautiful alluring narration. As a pagan, I highly approve of this behaviour the village encounters..."
5,Great book!,"This should be required reading for any gaijin interested in Irish music sessions. Even if you're not interested in playing sessions, but just want to know what Irish music is all about, check this one out."
3,Two Bad Movies And No Cigar,"In the ""Close But..."" review, that's the ""Striptease"" soundtrack, not the ""Showgirls"" soundtrack, which contains the hit version of ""Gimme Some Lovin'""."
2,"If you are a US fan, stay away...","If you are expecting & desiring the US version of Gimme Some Lovin', go elsewhere. This is not the compilation for you. This version feels lifeless and unenthused. Be sure to listen to the sample clip, as the backing vocals are absent on this version. Bad record company, bad record company."
5,A Great Book!,"Fire in the Hole is a really good book. It's about a boy named Mick Shea who lives in a Union Mining town in North Idaho. His father is a union miner who goes on strike. Mick Shea wants to go to college at Gonzaga University, but his father wants him to stay and work in the mines. I think this is a good book because I like historical fiction a lot and almost everything in this book really happened. It's interesting to find out what happened. It makes you care about the characters a lot and wonder what's going to happen to them. It's one of my favorite historical fiction novels."
4,"Guitars, drums, beat and energy. Simple formula = Great CD","This is a great cd that ages very well with enough diversity to keep the album fresh.Seems like everybody likes ""Calypso"" and I don't blame them. I was actually surprised when I heard it in some Bruce Willis movie, but I don't think it is the stand out song of the album. I can't go past the raw energy of ""Don't Kill Nipper"" and ""Horschack Army"". ""Chest Hair"", ""Goin' Off"" and ""Driving Up The Ceiling"" also are winners.I am a guitarist, but I play Flamenco. Spiderbait (this cd in particular) takes me back to the amp and the overdrive. They have a simple formula (drums, guitar and bass) but they they hit the notes at the right times with right balance of sound.If you search for the lyrics of ""Glokenpop"" from their ""Grand Slam"" album, it will sum up Spiderbait for you. Simple and very effective."
4,Very Good Performance Of Holst's Planets....,"It's unfortunate Colin Davis' recording here wasn't given the remastering ""one bit imaging"" other types in the Phillips/Decca/DG catalog have received: a really nice solid performance has been otherwise mared by overly strident strings & blaring brass - you need a high-end system to over come this & even then it's always a trade-off. Still there are find moments here worth listening to & at this price."
4,A MUST read if you are heading for the Cooks!,"We just got back from a two week exploration of the Cooks and found this book VERY helpful. The Cooks will quickly convince you that if you've only been to Hawaii, you've only gone half way to Heaven!Unfortunately, we required hospital services (because of tainted food), and this book over simplifies issues of needed medical care. (Details that should be included in EVERY travel guide!)Naturally, most prices quoted are actually higher, but that's just dealing with reality.We observed ""newbies"" arriving without this book, and therefore, without a clue of where to go or what to do.FOUR Stars because this book was so valuable, but as with most, there is room for improvement."
2,"Not bad, unfortunately out of date","Having recently returned from the Cook Islands, I cannot highly recommend this book. While the history and culture sections are interesting, the lodging and shopping/restaurants sections leave a lot to be desired. Most of the businesses mentioned have either gone out of business or changed hands. This is especially true on Aitutaki, where only one of the businesses recommended was still in its present form! As another reader recommended, the book does not sufficiently cover home rentals which are a great way to stay on these islands for a reasonable amount (and most can be viewed and reserved on the internet!). David Stanley's Moon Handbooks South Pacific guide is a much better choice--it is more up to date and covers all the major South Pacific islands for almost the same amount of money."
4,A fascinating view into the soul of the Northern Catholic,This book is based on dozens of interviews by Fionnuala O'Connor with Catholic celebrities as well as men and women of the street and provides a fascinating view into the way of thinking of the Catholic community. The book should by read by everyone who is interested in the Northern Ireland question.
4,sadly true,"I picked up this book not expecting it to be true. The author does a good job of illuminating the lives of many people in and around the main character Ota Benga. This book also expertly portrays the cultural and political environment that raped Africans in the Belgian Congo, and oppressed them in Anglo-America. I highly reccomend this for your own library if you are an honest student of history."
1,Heart Shaped Cheesecake Pans,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible !!Needed 4 large heart shaped pans to make for a wedding. The clip on the pans broke immediately. Also purchaed 10 of the small size heart shapped - the pans are hard to close, and very difficult to take off w/out damaging the cake.Wilton should be ashamed to sell these products."
5,works great would recommend this pan.,"works great would recommend this pan, love to use this on cheese cake, never fails, hope you enjoy it as much as we do"
5,"It may leak, but we can prevent it in advance!","Well, I have to say I love this product. When I buy it, I also have the concern that what if it leak? So, before I use it to make my cheese cake, I use two piece of wax paper to cover the bottom plate and then put the side part onto the bottom plate. To make sure it won't leak and water won't go inside when using the shower baking method, I also use tinfoil paper to cover the whole bottom part of my spring form pan. So it turns out that no water went into my pan and nothing leak out. My cake is perfect. So if you have the same concern as I do, just make your cake in my way. Good luck!"
1,This should be wilton's !!,"I bought the 6"" pan few weeks ago, and i was not sure about it!! generally I don't prefer spring-form pans, but I bought it anyway.I tried it today and it was a disaster, it leaked the batter out!!! and my cake didn't rise at all."
2,cake batter leaked all over my oven,i recently purchased two springform pans and i am not happy with theire performance. the cake batter leaked out of the bottom of both pans and made a huge mess in my oven.
5,Great Pan,"This pan works great, just what I expected. Good quality and fast delivery. Made riccotta pies with this pan and they released with no problem and looked good."
2,Not leakproof,"Wilton's springform pan looks quite nice, and both my stepdad and I were fooled into thinking that it would perform just as nicely. Unfortunately, the batter started leaking through quite quickly. My stepdad was so convinced of this pan's superiority that he pointed out that maybe it's SUPPOSED to leak! Ugh. I think I'll stick to my old cheapie pan."
2,It leaks,My first time to buy Wilton stuff. It leaks and it is not easy to clean. I'm gonna buy another one.
5,Best 4 inch springform pan,"Let me begin by first stating that I have purchased 2 types of 4 inch springform pans in the past 3 months, these non-stick pans and the ""plain jane"" 4 inch springform pans, and boy is there a difference.I've listed the differences below:* The non-stick pans are sturdier than the ""plain jane"" pans.* The non-stick pans springs are not popping out of the holder as they are with the ""plain jane"" pans.* The non-stick pans are not rusting like ""plain jane"" pans.* The non-stick pans make is easier to remove the food than the ""plain jane"" pans.I do recommend washing and then immediately drying the pans to avoid any possible rusting.The non-stick pans cost a little more than the ""plain jane"" pans, but not a whole lot more. They are definitely worth every penny. I would highly recommend this pan to anyone!"
5,Great little pan,We got this as part of a set of pans. All are well built and worked great. Easy clean up too.
2,Leaks...,"Bought this pan to make a standard layered cake, and the bottom does not fit tightly into the springform sides -- thus, there was a fair amount of leakage. I bought the pan even after reading reviews attesting to the leak issue thinking it wouldn't be so bad, particularly for a standard cake (not a cheesecake), but my wishful thinking turned out not to be enough... Maybe there is inconsistency with these pans, and maybe some of them work perfectly, but mine sadly falls short of basic expectations..."
4,Too bad I didn't use it sooner.,"This is my first negative experience with a Wilton product. I didn't bake anything in it until I'd had it more than 2 months, so the full-refund return period had expired. And, as other reviewers have said, it leaks. Luckily I was cautious enough to put the pan on a cookie sheet for its trial run. Since the leak is very minor an aluminum foil wrap will take care of the seepage. And, unlike other reviewers' pans, mine didn't rust.On the plus side, this pan makes a perfect half-sized cheesecake. I have a savory 9-inch recipe that I take to parties (it's accompanied by crackers or tortilla chips) but it serves 24. I halved all the ingredients for this pan and it worked perfectly. I'll keep using it and not bother looking for a replacement."
5,Absolutely the Perfect Springform Pans,"I saw a great deal on a set of 3 that was too good to pass by and I am really glad I got them. These Wilton Nonstick Excelle Elite Springform Pans perform perfectly. It is great to buy a product that does exactly what it is supposed to do. When you take the time to make a cheesecake or any cake you want flawless performance like these pans deliver. You can use these on virtually any cakes or tortes. I have the 8"", 9"", and 10"". No drama baking and no surprises. Yummmoo."
1,Origami skills,"If you really think this book will help you become a better listener, then by all means, go ahead and read it. Otherwise, just consider the topic and use a little common sense. If this book somehow falls into your hands i'd suggest you use it to practice your origami skills--at least the paper used to print this on won't go to waste."
5,Love it!,"Not for the reggae traditionalist, but I'd bet even the traditionalist could appreciate this music. I love the dub/club modern style (don't let the club part throw you off, it's just got electronic influences, this in not techno.) Great music. If you enjoy this you'll probably also love the album ""Laika Come Home"" by Space Monkeys Vs. Gorillaz, ESPECIALLY if you're a Gorillaz fan. These are two of my favorite reggae albums ever. Not to disrespect the classics, which are timeless."
4,Unexpected surprise,"I had never heard of this film, but decided to rent it during one of Amazon's special promotions. I really enjoyed it. The storyline spans several generations and was compelling and interesting to watch. Strong female characters, good acting, and a good story. I would recommend it."
4,Remembering traditions of the past and present,"Reading Homemade Hospitality brought back many memories of my childhood and youth when families and friends visited regularly. There were always refreshments available for visitors, including adding more ingredients to stretch the meals. Barbara's ideas for entertaining were delightful and would make any party, luncheon, or overnight visit fun and exciting. The description of her friendship with the dear and precious lady, Mrs. Mary Cunningham, who was my former sixth grade teacher and friend, made the book even more special. This book, in today's rushed and technologically advanced society, reminds us that we should continue family traditions, especially through being hospitable to others--wherever we are."
5,Brilliant but needs to be trimmed,"I am a huge fan of jazz, fusion, and Jaco in particular. Though he was in pretty bad shape from his drug addictions when this album was recorded and released, this is truly a display of incredible musicianship and raw energy from all three. The live tracks are intense and fantastic but I could have done without the studio recordings and the multiple takes on Para Oriente. If you play drums, bass, or guitar, likely one of these members is your hero and you'll surely love it. If you are or think you might be into crazy prog/jazz/fusion stuff and want something new in your ipod, you'll love it. Everyone else, just buy it and if you hate it, John still has your money. Its not an easy album to find so just get it online. (R.I.P Jaco and Tony)"
5,lost gem,"thankfully McLaughlin had a change of heart and allowed these recordings to surface. 3 stars of instrumental jazz rock, 2 of them snuffed out way too soon."
4,What might have been?,"I studied Tony Williams as a young percussionist in the '60's, McLaughlin I saw many times in the early seventies and Jaco Pastorius later. My ear knew what they were capable of as individuals and in ensemble. True I was expecting some kind of hair raising epiphanal synergy that would blast open my chakras or at least get me up to boogie even if only in spirit. What this shows is the enormous potential brought by these three masters who for whatever reason could not or chose not get it there in this group. It shows in the journey they took together as they were playing in 3 other worlds within the same piece and maybe that's where the magic is for some. Some listener in future will take the next step from this CD as an inspiration. I gave it 4 stars for taking the risk to make unique music not just to sell records."
4,Trio Of Delight,"It would be very difficult to put together a more powerful trio of Fusion giants on one disc. Jaco was and is the greatest electric bass player that ever lived. And Tony Williams was probably one of the most creative drummers to ever pick up a pair of sticks. As far as John McGlaughlin, need I say more than Mahavishnu Orchestra."
2,Mediocre release from musical titans,"No one would ever rightly say that these three players are anything less than sublime. But for whatever reason, this set doesn't work at all. These seems less of a concerted band effort and more of three musicians going in three different directions. Even classics like Jaco's ""Continuum"" are rendered depressingly weakly here. It's a shame, because this could have been a massive record. Instead, it's just kind of a disappointment and a reminder that even the greatest players aren't superhuman."
2,Too much drumming...,"I have heard this material a long time ago, when it first came out. As a solid Jaco fan, I adored his playing and interplay with Maclaughin, but I knew something was not clicking. After listening hard this time, I understood: Williams drumming is way far too complicated. It does not leave space for the guitar and bass to breathe. I supposse this guys were too excited with each other capabilities that they simply did not get the patience to listen to each other. Pity, such a wasted chance."
1,Unlistenable,"Pointless noodling. Yes, the three musicians featured in this live Havana gig (which also features some some studio extras) did, on their own, create some fine jazz-rock fusion, but together, as heard on this dull cd, hardly create enough of a flame to light up a Cuban cigar."
2,The Bay of Gigs,"Other than a great drum solo by Tony Williams that starts this disc out, a burning solo by McLaughlin on ""Dark Prince"" and a decent version of Pastorius' ""Continuum"", there is really nothing here to listen to. Much of the rest of this CD is Pastorius playing away from the changes and McLaughlin trying to salvage the proceedings by playing either louder or faster. Williams tries desperately to hold it all together while Mclaughlin and Pastorius twiddle away at each other. McLaughlin was never happy with the results of this meeting in the first place and stated for years that he never wanted this recording to see the light of day. Knowing Pastorius was going through a lot of personal problems at this time and probably wasn't in top form here, I bought this mostly out of curiosity. You're better off spending your money on both the new essential McLaughlin and Pastorius CD's that just came out. You can get this if you're really that curious, but don't expect much."
2,the fourth dimension,"never knew the studio stuff was dubbed with audience, on the havana jam records/cds....i guess 1 shot to record in the studio is what it is.the live stuff is pure nasty and better than the studio.get the tony williams lifetime stuff,in fact get the 2 havana jam cds, they have so much music and better playing,by weather report,cbs allstars,irakere,fania allstars.just saw jhn and the fourth dimension,it's the real deal,go see them,they'll blow your mind!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Should Never Released It,"""Trio Of Doom,"" which is a stupid name for a group, is a terrible album. You would think McLaughlin, Williams, and Pastorius could come up with better material than this, but no, what we have here is complete drab, heartless noodling. Nothing is of substance here. Just three guys standing around seeing who can impress the other person first.I'm not impressed and anyone who likes any one of these musicians will probably be disappointed. They can do so much better than this. Sony should have NEVER released this rubbish."
4,"Remember, they enlarge these photos!","Lovely earrings and well-made, but given the carat size, they are tiny on the ear. These earrings are best if you just want a subtle sparkle, or have multiple piercings. I gave mine to my 16-year-old daughter who wanted something everyday, but wanted them to be ""real diamonds."" She's pleased and I'm pleased with the price. As for me, I need at least 1/2 carat on each ear, so I""m buying CZ for that...."
2,"Song 2 is awesome, rest if boring...","I bought this CD after hearing ""Song 2"" in trailers for Starship Troopers (which does not play during the movie). I looked for quite a while trying to figure out who published this piece and finally ordered blur. Much to my dissapointment, the rest of the album was dull, unchallenging and steeped in the technical inadequacies of alternative. Such a shame because when they get in the groove, no matter how technically adept or not, this group can rock!"
2,weird stuff,a lot of mumbling and strange dissonance. i didn't like it very much. the only songs i liked were Song 2 and On your Own. not my style i guess.
5,"if u like filter, u'l love herb town, flin, and gastab and W","hey sirs, do u like jim? then u shall like the fast paced techno beat of blur, possibly the worst music i've ever heard since bjork. hateness is flabcham. oh i forgot.. and dont forget that brian darnold got nuxted. take tim winsky's advise and eat that marlnoof. WRENCH i declair. LOOK, wrench is not only ant worming, but lubton say, ""dont eat forks in solitude so u can hore"" i love this cd, not blur, but wrench maglam""""gurd..sillsaw"" "" :\\\=oklkklove,timothy winsky"
2,Exploration Doesn't ALways Meet With Success,"I can only compare this one to Parklife and the Great Escape, both of which are driven by the great melodies & tight production. This one seems like they're trying to sound like Radiohead but falling far short. Blur's reason for being stems from their melodies, and this CD is lacking in that regard. I'd rather listen to jazz if I want something non-melodic."
2,Dont judge an album via it's singles.,"OK I'll admit I bought thier best of album for two reasons, Song 2 and the clever artwork and after a few listens I loved it. What I loved in particular was the songs off that album which were taken off the album ""Blur"", Song 2 is a given but also the amazing calm and catchiness of Beetlebum and the electronicly driven On Your Own. So on the back of those songs, I assumed this was Blur's best album and bought it.I had high hopes on first listen and I was conflicted. How could an album with some such amazing songs be so... bad? The first few songs are great but once part 2 of the album kicks in you end up fastforwarding through all the songs until you reach the end. I've only listened to the whole album twice and couldn't again, and unfortunately the ""white noise"" path would be the one they followed in future years."
4,Blur,I decided to get this c.d. after buying Modern Life is Rubbish and Blur:The Best Of. At first I thought it was a terrible album filled with sloppy guitar work and poor lyrics. But after listening to it for a second time I was plesantly surprised to find some of the greatest songs ever. Beetlebum reminds me of listening to the Beatles White Album. Song 2 and Chinese Bombs are short but amazing songs. Chinese Bombs even goes so far as to sing about Bruce Lee. You're So Great (The best track on the album)is proof that Coxon has the talent to write songs. Look Inside America and Strange News From Another Star stay true to the brit-pop roots of Blur and wont fail to impress. The c.d. isn't without its flaws. Theme From Retro is just there to fill space and Essex Dogs is god-awful. Even with the two slip ups this is a album no Blur fan should go without.
1,Awful !,"This CD came out in 1997 and i had my hands on it in 1999. At the time when i bought the CD i only knew two songs...Beetlebum and Song 2. And these are actually the only good songs on the album. M.O.R. ( Blur tried to sound like a punk version of Beatles here )is another track that needs a little bit of attention, but still not enough to make the album a good one.The rest of the songs ( and a lot of them ) are just boring, noises , no melody, no rhythm...nothing. I can't even believe how come Blur is considered a good band.Publicity i guess , can make anybody famous and big. Talking about music, this CD should not even be in ''music'' category. It's a failure. Except the first two songs. AWFUL !"
1,The beginning of the end,"""Blur's frontman Damon Albarn basically announced that he was withdrawing from the race."" This means, apparently, abandoning everything that made Blur's music worthwhile in the first place. The only thing worse than hearing your favorite band descend into unlistenable banality is to witness it being embraced (briefly, of course) by that vast, taste-bereft segment of the american population that made Song 2 such a big hit. I would like to think that Damon would shudder at the thought of his songs being played at frat parties and on Intel commercials (both of which all but negates the value of your art). While their next release didn't produce a ultra-profitable monster hit like Song 2, it did little if anything to restore Blur's integrity. Damon let a LOT of his long-time fans down with this one, who are now mumbling that the Blur's rumored breakup is coming two years (and two albums) too late."
5,ONE AWSOME CD!,When I first got this CD I thought it stunk. The only song I really liked was Song 2. I had thought a little bit different then what it was. I had no idea Blur was British. Any way....I listened to Death of a Party and Chinese Bombs I thought they were great. Country Sad Ballad Man is all right but it kind of stinks too.
4,This is the American Blur,This album is for the American Blur fan near you. It has Grahm's strong guitar sound and Damon's inspirational song writing.
4,"great, but not a bunch of Song 2's","Ironically, Song 2 was the song that got me interested in Blur, and it turned out that none of their other songs (except maybe Chinese Bombs) sound at all like that, especially not on the earlier alubms . . . thank god their old stuff is good, too! Seriously, this is a good album, and it's not just the same old Blur that you've heard before . . . it brings back memories of ""Leisure"" but grungier. Besides the infamous ""Song 2"", there is also ""Beetlebum"", ""On Your Own"", ""Country Sad Ballad Man"", and the under-appreciated ""You're so Great (and I love you)"". Get it, but expect change."
3,Blur goes American?,"When I first heard this CD, I almost had to look at the cover to make sure that I bought the right CD. I was somewhat disapointed with it at first, with the exception of a few songs. It sounds so American, not like any of thier older material. So for all of you non Blur fans,Who are into alternative music, this album I'm sure you'll love. I have talked to so many people who have only heard of Blur just because of this album. But for all of you fans of early Blur materal, you may not like this CD at first, but if your like me you will learn to love it in time. Bye it anyways."
3,Is this really what we wanted?,"I don't know about this--it's certainly not the reason I fell in love with Blur. I'll admit, I like it fairly well now, although I absolutely hated it when I first heard it. The weirdly popular Song 2 is one of the weaker tracks, but there is some fairly interesting stuff here. Look Inside America is in a fairly similar vein to their older stuff, and Strange News From Another Star is very good. On Your Own is highly catchy, and Essex Dogs is bizarrely evocative. All in all, if, like me, you liked Blur for their older material, you probably won't exactly be blown away, but it's still probably worth buying."
5,BLUR is awesome.,"Along with many other of the reviewers, I am American. I heard song 2 and went to buy the cd. i was surprised because few of the songs on here sound anything like the style used on song 2, but it grew on me. Other rocking songs like MOR, funky ones like death of a party, and acoustic talent like from look inside america won me over and i now can't stop listening to this cd. If you are expecting a bunch of jumping up and down rock like song 2, then stay away, but if you're willing to try something new then chech this cd out. i love it."
2,Damon moves from fun to freaky!,"Living in England for most my life I have experienced BritPop to it's extreme, and I must say this flies off the handle! Most of the songs are artsy, spacey, or just plain weird! I think if you liked The Great Escape you will despise this. Song 2 does rock though!"
1,yawn,"3 good songs: Beetlebum, song2 and MOR. Blur used to be about making music- good music. But this is the begining of the end"
2,"Like Radiohead, Except Not Good","This album was on sale for 1 cent, not counting shipping and handling, so I immediately bought it. I, like everyone else, purchased it so that I could get Song 2. Song 2 was really all I got. Beatlebum and M.O.R were interesting and okay at best, and the rest was static garbage. I forced myself to listen through the whole thing in hopes that I'd find something nice but it never came."
1,beware: catatonic,"i listened to this album one time, randomly pressing the fast forward button during bad or boring songs. before i knew it, the record had ended, and i'd only completely listened to two of them. what a disappointment. i'm just sorry i didn't save the receipt."
1,damon sells out to americans..,any reviewers who didnt buy this album for ONE SONG and have actually heard previous blur know this album is trash..damon has sold out to the american audience
3,Not Bad,Song 2 and a couple of other songs are really good but the rest of the Cd is just plain dull and boring. I just have to say that I hope their next one is better.
5,IT'S THE BEST I HAVE EVER HEARD!,BLUR IS THE BEST AND ALL OF THEIR CD'S ARE GOOD. I GONNA STAND BEHIND THEM WHAT EVER IS GONNA HAPPEN.THEY HAVE MY WORD ON THAT.I PROMISE.
3,a grower,"when this first came out, my friends were pissed. they all wanted to know what the hell hapenned to Blur and why they decided to trash their english pop sensibilities in favour of become Sonic Youth? after the initial shock, this album starts to reveal it's own personality to the jaded Blur fan. in my opinion, the single ""Song 2"" (which became their biggest hit) is not a good representation of this album. most of the material here is hazy and noisy with some distant melody floating in and out of the drone. there's some interesting stuff here, but it seems a bit unfocused and sloppy and desperate at times. but, it shows a spirit of experimenting and adventure. the seeds of their next album ""13"" can be well researched here on this self titled piece of work."
4,Strange Music,"Blur has a very unusual style of music! They were a popular group in England and then after that, there music came to the U.S. I don't think they were as popular in America as they were in England but their music still sold a lot.I mainly became interested in them after hearing the popular ""Song 2"" as being the theme song from the computer game: Fifa 98. Since I liked the song so much I wanted to know more about the artist. None of the other songs really sounded like ""Song 2"" and most of them were pretty weird, but I still think the album is worth a listen. I can't give a very good explanation on how their music sounds, Their just another rock band!If ""Song 2"" is the only song you have heard by Blur, I think it would be best that you listen to some more of their music before you by the album and you might want to consider buying the best-of."
1,One of the Worst cd's ever!,"I heard Song 2 on the radio and I thought it was awesome so i went out and bought the cd. But when I started to listen to the other songs on the cd, I soon learned a valuable lesson: never hear one song and buy the cd. I haven't even listened to the whole thing because its just so bad. I really can't figure out how anyone could like this .... It really does boggle my mind."
1,one hit wonder,"I loved one song, and one song only: Song 2. And what kind of name is that anyways, huh?"
3,Supporting a Great Voice!!,"This will not make it to my ""favorites"" category. But Sunshine is a powerhouse of a voice. She needs a better writer (and promoter by the way) behind her, beside her, to work with her. I suggest R. Kelly (as a writer) right off the bat. This just wasn't a great body of work to me."
2,Production subpar,I did not like this CD at all. Song production was lacking and seemed like it lacked good songwriting too.
5,Loved the CD,"Sorry for the delay - I'm out of town at this time and I reviewed this last night but I must have forgotten to submit. The CD was in excellent condition and arrived in a timely manner.Thanks,Lorine"
3,strong songs and tepid tunes,"Welcome back Sunshine!!! She puts out a pretty strong album though toward the end the music begins to sound like pretty run of the mill R&B. Her strength is the angry black woman anthems,but she really fights against being stereotyped with a few love songs, which are good. I just like it more when she's angry, then you can really hear the passion. There's no shame in being an angry black woman Sunshine, there are many many out there and they need music too, stick to your strengths. Overall though I missed her music and am glad she's back."
5,At last Rock and Roll forever,Zak and the one-eyed snakes bring alive all the reasons rock & roll will live forever. Sky Boy is a major hit with great emotion! A must have CD!
4,Good Glitch Juice,"This box set contains the four ""core"" raster-noton artists. Its minimal, experiment, ambiant, noise, glitch, etc. The packaging is cool, with each band on their own CD EP. The CD's are transparent except for the first half which is cut with tracks - pretty cool looking. Mine came in a big zip lock bad with Raster-Noton printed on the outside?I have and like an Alva Noto EP, but this was my first introduction to the other three artists: byetone, komet, and COH. The ""[O]acis box"" is well worth the cost to have such a good sampling from this label (I esp. dug on COH - they have been playing with my head all day - I love these guys and can't wait to find more of their stuff). There are some good suprises dropped into the mostly minimal glitch ambiant bass tracks. Basically, if you dig glitch and the various sub-sub-sub genres played wtih here then you will dig this box set!The Raster-Noton web site says this is a limited run of 1000! So, get it while you can."
1,I hate this. Period,I hate this gun! it one of the worst purchases i have probably ever made in my llife. This gun made me quit and hate paintball permanantly. That is how much this gun sucks.
5,The Best,"I have two Yorkies with sensitive skin and this is the best shampoo I have ever used. Great for the skin and smells wonderful.I took it for the groomer to use and they loved it as well, asked where to purchase it!"
3,His biggest commercial hit!,"This was Dan's first solo effort after leaving the group America. Released in 1979 it was a huge hit on Christian and Adult Contemporary stations, and even crossed over onto the Pop charts. The title song was a number 1 Christian hit and stayed in the AC top ten for more than 30 weeks. The album was nominated for a Grammy. Other strong tracks include One Way, Love Was Just Another Word (which features his former America band mates), and I Have To Say Goodbye. Despite being his most commercially successful release, I thought that this was actually one of his weaker albums. Not that this is a bad album, it is good, but I found his later releases to be better. Hopefully the rest of his solo material will be released in the near future."
4,CCM's first crossover hit!,"This was Dan's first solo album after leaving the group America. It was also his biggest commercial hit. Released in 1979, the title song went to number 1 on the CCM charts and stayed there for 13 weeks! It also crossed over to the Billboard Pop chart and Adult Contemporary chart were it peeked at number 6 and stayed on the charts for a then record 34 weeks! Regardless of what you may read elsewhere, this was CCM's first crossover hit. Two other singles were released from this album, ""Ready for Love"" which was a big hit on Canadian Adult Contemporary stations, reaching number 7; and ""Divine Lady"" which was a hit on CCM stations in the US. It also contains what Dan described as his last song with America, Love Was Just Another Word - which features his America band mates Dewey Bunnell and Gerry Beckley. A must for CCM fans or America fans!"
1,NAET Guide Book: The companion say goodbye to illness,"Naet companion is an A4 brochure which is recommended for purchase before any treatment is pursued...you should therefore also purchase the book. I thought it expensive, around 10. and disappointed that I could not really use the book. I suppose I mis-read the notes, but I had already thrown one away that I had bought on e-bay. A medical type brochure. I wish I hadn't wasted my money, you need to commit yourself to a specialist person first; then buy."
4,Wonderful Co-book,"This book is essential while you are receiving the NAET treatments. It is clear and consise as to what you should not be eating, smelling or touching during your 25-hr avoidance period. It gives you a selection of food that you may choose from. It tells you the order of things that you'll be treated for, why, and what you can expect to gain. It will also describe some of the clearing affects you may experience during your avoidance period. My doctor requires you to read the first 32 pages before treatment. This way, my cooperation with his expertise is assured a positive result."
3,the demon head master.,I like the demon head master because it is exciting and exciting books are good.But there is one thing that I don't like about the demon head master and that thing is it is to long and I don't like long storys.And it is a little bit discusting and the
4,This is a book that is well-worth reading.,"I would recommend this book to children aged between 8 and 12. The exciting adventures in this sequel, though, make it enjoyable for all ages. I would also recommend all of Gillian Cross' other books - especially 'The Great Elephant Chase'. Finally, hi to everyone at LGGS school in England!"
5,Works perfectly,"Great barrel at a good price, it passes light with nearly zero loss and keeps pairs together well. Can't ask for more than that, though the price seems to be rising quickly lately."
3,Not Dying to Read This,"The book is ok. I was deceived by the cover somewhat; after a great experience with the Yellow Rose Mystery books by Leann Sweeney, I was hoping this series was going to be just as good. Not really. The main character, Helen, is a smart forty-something working as a telemarketer in order to avoid her ex husband. I really didn't think the whole story about Helen and her ex was believable, but I suppose it's the only way the author could place this otherwise smart woman in such deplorable working conditions. Helen just isn't exciting; she isn't a particularly good sleuth, and the story and characters weren't involving. I'd recommend this book with caution."
4,New heroe's and villian's you love to loathe!,"I enjoyed this book, Helen is back at another dead end job, she works as a telemarketer.. She meets new villians and old friends to break the monotany of being a telemarketer. After hearing a murder she sets out to prove that florida's upper middle class has skeletons in the closet and some really shadey dealings."
4,Good for a snowy afternoon escape,"Surprisingly good for escape mystery fiction. Good pacing and an appealing heroine. Fascinating insights into the boiler room world. When I keep reading, without being tempted to peek at the ending and stop reading, it's a good book.I lived in Fort Lauderdale for about 3 years and loved the Las Olasshops and restaurants. I probably wouldn't recognize the place now.Quibbles: Some activities of the bad guys seemed a little over the top. The heroine's rationale for being on the lam is very similar to the male hero of another series. It's also a bit of a stretch. Her divorcce lawyer was too ""gentlemanly"" to ask certain questions at a hearing? Get the ""gentleman"" sued for malpractice and try again."
2,Eh...,"I thought this sounded like a fun mystery to read, but I was wrong.I got about 1/3 of the way through until I gave up. It just didn't keep my attention. Plus I couldn't really get a feel for the main character. I guess I couldn't relate to her much.I'll pass on the rest of this series too."
3,Just skimmed the surface of each movie...,"Trying to learn more about Ronald Colman, I had gotten this book as well as the one by his daughter, Juliet Colman. I was disappointed in this book because it didn't go into get detail. I would have like to know about him during each of the movies, especially the big ones like Random Harvest and Lost Horizon. Reading about how he found working with Greer Garson or Jane Wyatt (more than a handful of sentences each) would have been wonderful...How about a chapter on each of the major films he did...details...details."
5,A must read for all political and business leaders!,"Shocking! Mr. Rutherford has done his homework. Who shot Goldilocks? will give you new insight into the internal workings of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Greenspan's seriously flawed decision making techniques and the unbelievable amount of power wielded by so few. In fact, this book will leave you with grave concern for the current economy and longing for answers to a much needed money-system overhaul. A great read!S. Miller"
3,what happend!,"cradle of filth has been changing these last few cds that came out. Everything from damnation to this has been..... i hate to say but...mainstream. The songs on thornography are slower than the other cds. now if u wanna hear good cradle of filth pick up midian,dusk and her embrace and the cds behind that one. Now i gave this cd 3 stars because of rise of the pentagram, tonight in flames and dirge inferno. If your just starting to listen to cradle of filth dusk and her embrace should be a good start."
2,Can't believe this is COF,"I'm a loyal COF fan and I didn't really expected them to release the ""Dusk and Her Embrace"" v.2006 album but ""Thornography"" which would be a good album for several bands it's just the worst album for Dani and the crew. I expected them to follow the line they trace after ""Nymphetamine"" (which I enjoyed very much) but they definetely decided to explore some more commercial fields spewing out this cheap music for vampire-wanna-be teenagers. I cannot imagine Paul Allender or Adrian Erlandsson wasting their proven talent playing these songs live.If you're into bands like Nightwish or Tristania go for the disc otherwise stay away from it and play ""The Principle of Evil made flesh"" instead to remember what Cradle of Filth was."
4,not too bad,okay yeah this album is way more poppy then there other stuff. but its still got good songs and catchy hooks. so its not so bad. i would recomend you buy it if you can find it used.
1,If Cradle of Filth Couldn't Sink Any Lower,"Yikes...this is the epitome of garbage here. Cradle of Filth have been going down the spiral since after they released ""Lovecraft and Witchhearts"" in 2002, which was a retrospective on their tolerable side of their career. I mean, after going to the Blabbermouth news blog and reading the blog about Villie Valo from *cough* H.I.M. *cough* making a guest appearance, that was it. I could no longer stand this band and Dani Filth any longer. The songwriting is basic, and the vocals are abysmal as always. Wow, Roadrunner Records has really jumped the ship this year, and ""Thornography"" is proof. This isn't black metal, or even metal at all. It's not even tolerable. Congratulations on embarrassing yourselfs, Cradle of Filth. Now excuse me while I listen to Satyricon and 1349 from now on."
2,This is bad.,"I find it hard to believe this is the same band that created Cruelty And The Beast. I liked all COF up to this release right here. Cradle hasn't been a Black Metal band since Cruelty, and after that they still at least had some good tunes. I can't believe they released this with a straight face. If they keep up down this road, they'll be seen on Jay Leno before you know it. It's bad enough they were on Viva La Bam on MTV, a show that pushes Billy Idol and other posers not worth mentioning here. The good thing about this? There's still great Black Metal bands around that aren't playing to 'the teenage crowd."" If this has you down listen to these Gods: Mayhem, Tsjuder, Gorgoroth, Darkthrone, Blood Ritual, even Dimmu Borgir hasn't strayed this far into teen/mtv land."
2,Oh my my. I expect a tour with AFI to follow.,"I hate to be a COF hater, granted I've always hated their image,lousy videos and goofy attempts to be shocking. But every album from POEMF to Midian I would give 4 or 5 stars to(especially cruelty)After Damnation and a day they begin to slip then nymphetimine pushed them clear off. Instead of trying to pull themselves up they wallow in the same mediocre goth-core rock pool pulling the same tricks that were a bore on the last album.I had a hard time even getting through this cd without fading out and losing focus. I think COF may be dead. I'll leave it for the kids."
3,WHAT HAPPEN WITH CRADLE?????,"Im a big fan of black metal since 90's and specially cradle of filth, and I respect all the work done for this band, but this album is just the worst cradle album ever!!!What is the future of the black metal with this kind of albums??Maybe Snoop Dog opening for cradle of filth??? Well who knows, to me they only care for money .if you really know what is black metal , u cant compare Principle of the evil made flesh with Thornography.If you are new into the Black metal , I recommend you start with The Principle of the Evil Made Flesh (best cradle album ) and if you really want to go into the PURE BLACK METAL u cant go wrong with bands such as BURZUM , DARK FUNERALMAYHEM etc...."
1,pretentious crap!,Yet another goth popstar posers lame attempt at black metal. Pretentious as ever. What's sad is these are old men but their audience are 10-14 year olds. Pretty retarded if you think about it. I bet they laugh all the way to the bank.
4,Well done lads!,"It's great to hear the filth experimenting with new sounds and production techniques. I was a bit concerned on the first listen through as it is definitely different to their other releases but the new songs sound great. Give it a chance and get over the fact that it's not a ""Principle of Evil Made Flesh"" reincarnation (like that would be possible anyway) and I am sure you will be pleasantly surprised. The songs are going to sound great live, I can only hope they tour in Japan"
1,Terrible,"The Majority of the Reviews here say it best. Besides the First Intro Track (which is surprisingly good) this record is terrible. It seriously sounds like Cradle has been deeply influenced by the vast number of terrible new and up-incoming bands they've toured with over the last two years. This Record makes Nymphetamine sound like Dusk and Her Embrace. Seriously, dont bother buying it."
2,"Very bad album... no really, it was BAD!","ThornographyThis album is horribly dissapointing... seriously, it is an utter disappointment. The only good song on it is Temptation. I can't stand Byronic Man or Foetis Of A New Day Kicking... listening back to V Empire, Midian, Lovecraft And Witchhearts, From The Cradle To Enslave, this album is a mere shadow of what was once Cradle Of Filth's ultimate glory. Like I said, Temptation is a good song. I liked it. It's a nice music video too. But I highly reccomend staying away from this... *ahem* excuse the word pun, FILTH. If you want to hear some good COF listen to their older albums... I personally like V Empire and From The Cradle To Enslave.Or better yet listen to Slayer =D"
5,So easy to listen to this,"I watched this movie late one night on T.V. Next day some of the songs were still drifting through my head, stirring up memories or just made me hum along. Knew I had to buy the soundtrack. It's a really good one to keep in the car for the ride home after a long day at work. Alan Brewer's guitar instrumentals are simply haunting and quite lovely. I even tried to look him up to see if he's got anything of his own out there. My favorite on this album is Willy with EmmyLou Harris doing ""Somebody pick up my pieces""."
5,Excellent,"If you like traditional, heartfelt country music then this soundtrack is for you. There are some great tracks but the stand-out is What's Done Is Done sung by Jeannie Max Lane and written By her hubby Jerry Max Lane."
5,Great music!,"Sensual country music is all I can say. This was not only one of my favorite movies, but the score added a whole dimension to the movie and is just as fabulous as a CD. Listen to the track samples, you will see. Or better, make sure to see this movie too."
1,Inadequate Power,"After charging for days, this unit cannot even budge a V6. It is not rated for the advertised power output (400 Amps). After repeated emails, the manufacturer appears to have no interest in helping me utilize the unit."
1,Buy a stronger one!,"We have a '99 VW Golf GTI, which regularly fails to start due to battery problems. (Apparently this is a regular problem with VWs - they are handing out solar panels to charge the battery when parked. I guess that makes the Golf a solar-gasoline hybrid car :0). Anyway, I bought a replacement jumpstarter because I misplaced my previous one. This Amico models simply fails to start the engine - too weak. I'll have to buy a different model."
1,jump starter,this product didn't work as i expected at all didn't hold a charge cables were so short as to be inpractial poor product an design
1,Worked fine for a few months...,"They use a very cheap gel battery in this unit that is meant to cover you for the warranty period but no longer. At exactly 13 months it died on us and never worked again. We ended up buying the Clore ES2500KE to replace it and it's like night and day.The Clore never misses a jump, we've dropped it in the mud, on rocks, and banged it around in the back of a pickup and now over a year later the Clore is still going strong. Skip this headache. You'll be glad you did."
4,Works Fine For Me,"The product easily jump started my Toyota Corolla when the car's battery died.The compressor also works well. I've used it to repair a tire that was severely deflated. It's a lot more convenient than finding a gas station with an air pump and dropping in more quarters every few seconds.The built-in light is extremely bright and came in handy when I had to change a flat tire at night.My only minor complaint is that I have to recharge the unit every three weeks or so, even when it hasn't been used."
5,One for the ages to come.,"Hope my titles don't scare people off, especially for great songs done by the Mighty Mos. I heard this song when I got the Ecko Unlimited Lyricist Lounge cd. With lines like"" a buck fifty but still swinging like a heavy weight,"" you have to purchase it. That line right there would have knocked Ali off of his verbal horse. And last but not least the beat. Man, I hate trying to break dance. I can beat box better than most, but breakdancing, ooohhh, that's not good. But I actually tried when I heard that beat. That's how ill it is. Pick this up."
5,New Talent,Amanda B establishes herself as an outstanding new singer and songwriter with this CD. I was so impressed by the depth and strength of her voice as well as the insightfulness and self-realization of her lyrics.All I can say is buy it and see for yourself.
5,"Amanda B is going to be ""the next hot thing""","I was blown away by this CD. There are great dance tracks like the title one, ""I could make you believe"" and also an amazing gospel-inspired track ""Avon Lady."" By the end of the CD - I was listening to it in my car - I had tears streaming down my face and I nearly had to pull over I was so overwhelmed. Just great - great lyrics, great music. You have a big smile on your face when the CD is over. It's way too short. I just keep hitting the REPLAY button."
1,A very ordinary writing..,"I was told by a co worker to buy this one to encourage this author. But the content was very ordinary, any DESI (indian who has settled or lives in the united states) will find it ordinary. This does not display the thinking,attitude and the real story of what immigrants go through, perhaps only those who go through this could have helped the author potray the truth."
2,Articles better than book,"I bought this book because I was very impressed with Kalita via her Newsday pieces. Unfortunately, this book doesn't carry the same comparative cultural insight that is a hallmark of her other writing. Read it and if you're going to buy anything, buy the Washington Post."
5,It was awesome!,"I accidentally ran across this anime series and I was blow away by it, I loved it! I found the other 3 dvds for it and 5 years later I still love to go back and watch it all over again. It was a fantastic story on how to deal with the pains of our past and how to pull forward to our future. Loved it!!! Thank you sooo much!"
1,Disappointing,Not much to recommend this book. I have read the other zone books which were delightful and entertaining in the way they sought to impose a lifestyle change.
5,EXCELLENT SELLER! GREAT BOOK-IN PERFECT BRAND NEW CONDITION!,"Book was recieved in brand new condition. Arrived promptly! Very pleased, Thankyou!"
1,Jack of All Trades...,"I hope the information dispensed by Dr. Kotz is better than what she expounds on the Atkins website. Her advice on that site suggest that you read the label of regular brewed beers for carbohydrate information.""A 12-ounce can of beer contains about 12.5 grams, but you have to read the label since carbohydrate content varies from brand to brand,"" says the doctor.Unfortunately, carbohydrate counts are NOT given on regular brewed beers. Makes you wonder if she's ever drank a beer in her life if that's the kind of ""accurate"" info she pens. Equally suspicious is the fact that she's contributed as an ""expert"" to Weight Watchers, The Zone, Slim-Fast, and Atkins. Suprised she hasn't jumped on the South Beach Diet bandwagon too."
5,It All Makes Sense Now!,"I have wanted to be in ""The Zone"" for a long time and already own Mastering the Zone (very confusing) and the Daoust's 40-30-30 book. I was still unsure and not 100% clear on how exactly it worked. This book makes it all so very simple! It has a shopping list, which is a huge help, and it's small enough to fit in your purse/bag. It also dispels the myths of high protein diets, and why they just aren't healthy for you. I would highly recommend it! This book ties up all the loose ends!"
4,"It really works, just not very fun!","This is THE diet if you really want to lose weight. If you follow the diet exactly and exercise regularly you will see the weight and inches come off very quickly, especially in the first two weeks. However, the portions are small and not often satisfying. It will teach you how to eat right, especially if you are like me and don't know how to cook dinner without pasta, rice or bread. The book is very easy to follow, the lists of good and bad foods are very helpful, and I liked that he recognizes the difference in metabolisms by suggesting different portions for men and women. I can see why this diet is so popular in Hollywood, you almost need a personal cook to prepare what Dr. Sears recommends for breakfast. There is no way anyone who works 9-5 has the time to prepare some of the suggested breakfasts. I would reccomend this book to anyone, but I would never give anyone the impression that you would enjoy anything about this diet other than losing the weight!"
3,Absolutely Nothing New,"Just a rehash of Dr. Sears prior books. At least it isn't his usual hard cover price (saving money gives it the 3 star rating).I still don't know how he can ""guarantee"" the Zone diet will cure cancer, prevent kidney failure and mild cases of PMS....but from personal experience I do know that following the Zoneperfect Nutrition Program has helped me lose weight and have more energy."
4,Good basic info,"The book does a good job of covering the basics of the Zone diet. I needed to supplement the info with some items off the web, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars."
3,Expensive Eating Habits,"I read Dr.Sears book because I need to live a healthier lifestyle. The book is very easy to read. I decided to follow the Zone Diet. Using the shopping list, and buying most of the item listed, I spent $161.00 for a weeks worth of meals (basically for one person). at the rate I am going I may end up healthier,but a lot poorer."
3,Good Info--but lifestyle wasn't for me,"In Nov 00 I made the choice to change my life. Since that time I have lost 40# and I have notices tons of other healthy changes. The doctor said that I am healthier now than I have ever been. I checked-out the hardbound version of 'The Zone' and it was full of great information. I ordered a 'Week in the Zone' and found it lacking info that I found in the first book--but it was a good outline of the program. I didn't go on the Zone diet but adapted some of the info to my Low-carb life-style. Since I was planning a life-time of change, I thought the Zone would require too much 'effort' and I would return to my old ways of life, so with my doctor's help we came up with a plan that included some of the Zones ideas. So far I found that I could live with it and it's working out great."
4,Life Changing Knowledge...,"This was my first Zone book, and I got a lot of it. The Zone philosophy is described in complete detail, and the various easy-to-follow menus are given. The indexes in the back are quite helpful for making ""cheat sheets"" for the grocery and travel. After 2 weeks in The Zone, I'd have to say I'm a believer. The concepts are easy to understand and easy to eat. I'm leaner, and more energetic. Food seems de-mystified. It's almost too hard to believe. If this book had better typography & layout, I'd give it 5 stars."
2,Did not work for me.,"A friend of mine reccomended this book to me and has raved about the zone. I tried the zone and did not experience all of the good things so many other readers have. I was constantly hungry. The food was overly bland and unsatifying. I almost gagged trying to eat some of the recipes because of the strange combinations and textures (...asparagus and egg white omelet). I still use some of the recipes (smoothies, a couple of salads, etc.) but this style did not fit me or my lifestyle. I did the full two weeks (my husband only made it for a couple of days) and still felt hungry constantly, still craved bread and carbohydrates, but I did lose a couple of pounds. It is a difficult regimen and takes all of the flavor out of food. It includes many vinegary, sharp tasting foods that just did not suit my appetite. Maybe it will work for someone else, but it did not work for me for the long term."
2,Zone,It has not work for me. Again it is really not a great deal of difference from other diets just looking at it differently.
2,If you like meat and science... buy this book!,"In looking for a low-carb diet, I decided to purchase several books on the subject matter in order to educate myslef and find the diet best suited to my needs. I'm a vegetarian - so low-carb diets in general are a little difficult. This book seems far better suited to meat eaters. Also, this book was intended to sell the ""Zone"" diet to the medical community by proving the scientific facts behind it. Fine and dandy if you've just got to understand every single reason for every single thing, but otherwise it comes off as TOO MUCH INFO! I really just wanted a brief on what to eat and why - I didn't need to look back 500,000 years and study the effects of our diet from a thousand different angles."
3,affairs of the heart,"Did not like Kim C. Not much chemistry....and the movie was broken up...a lot left unsaid...it was lacking and not memorable. I usually love Matthew Macfaydn, but it was just a bad script."
2,Not what it seemed.,"We enjoy and have purchased many of the British series from Masterpiece Theater and PBS.What we didn't know and it does not seem clear in the summaries, is that almost all the situations take place in the parlors, libraries or drawing rooms of homes.This makes the situations quite stuffy and many times, boring. There is little to no interaction outside in the beautiful countryside or hussle and bussle of the cities.The dialogue isn't stimulating enough to carry the confined space."
4,Upbeat fun from the mid-70s.,"I spent years trying to find this title...again. I first had the vinyl album and later the cassette, after they first came out, and wore both of them out before the end of the Seventies. From the first notes of ""Hospitality on Parade"" to the final strains of ""England"" this disc is filled with upbeat fun. My favorites are ""How Are You Getting Home?"" and the high-energy ""In the Future"" It does struggle a little with ""Profile"", but picks back up with their cover of ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand."" This disc may be an acquired taste, but hey...at least it ain't disco!"
3,The Hell-Fire Clubs,"The Hell-Fire Clubs is good enough in covering an interesting sidelight of British history, but the telling is rather routine and limited in what it covers. The author dips his toes rather than plunges into the milieu of squandered intelligence among wastrels. If you want to know what some Hell-Fire clubs were like, this will fill the gap. But if you want a close-up depiction, you will need to search for additional books."
5,Best Kids SPF but hard to find,"We bought this at Kings Dominion when we realized we left out Banana Boat spray in the car. I love PJ's adult sunscreen so I was happy to see that they made a kids version. After spending the whole day at the park in the balzing sun and VA heat PJ is the only sunscreen that protected my daughter's skin. We've used the Babies are us brand, Coppertone & Banana Boat and none of them ever kept her arms from turning red. PJ is the only one that works exceptionally well. Too bad it's so hard to find in the stores. I've been searching for another bottle all summer and so far Amazon is the only place I've been able to find it."
4,Good choice for Bedroom,"Positive - The picture quality if great.Negative - Channel Display is very small which makes it hard to see. Also when changing channels it takes a sec or 2 to bring up the next channel, so for the remote control junkie who likes the surf the channels this could be frustrating. I had to turn the base up to full and the treble all the way down to get the audio to sound fine and it does by doing this.Bottom Line - I got a good deal for less that $300 so overall I am satisfied."
2,Let the Buyer Beware,"I bought this television last year as a gift for a relative. I paid full price for it because it was a new item with a one year warranty (or so I thought). In less than a year, the television stopped working and I had it sent to a local Akai Authorized Repair Center. He informed me that the item was a REFURBISHED TV with only a 30-DAY WARRANTY. After several weeks of phone calls to Amazon Customer Service, I received only 80 percent of my money back. So, Let The Buyer Beware."
3,Great little TV but no VESA mount,Clear Picture but volumn/speakers are weak! Didn't realize when I bought it that there was no VESA mount on back of the unit.
2,Picture went black,"Worked fine for a few hours. Then the picture went black. Doesn't matter the input (tv, dvd, etc.), all have the same problem. Tried re-boot with no result. AKAI logo comes on briefly, then nothing. AKAI online support is nonexistent, owners manual is far-east translation, and one fix-it site suggests ""hitting it"". Back to the dealer it goes!!"
2,Good Read,"Enjoy reading the book, offered good advices.However; I was disappointed with the author's recommendation of getting ""The Power of Positive Thinking - Dr Norman Vincent Peale""."
5,Everything You Need To Know About Cajun Cooking,"The Encyclopedia of Cajun Cuisine (Chef John Folse) is a MUST HAVE for your kitchen! Beautiful photography, detailed information about ingredients and process, every standard REAL Cajun recipe. This tome (it weighs about 20 lbs!) is a steal at $49, and I would have paid far more for it. The first printing, Fall 2004, was sold out weeks before Christmas, but I managed to get 4 of them for gifts beforehand. The second printing (Febrauary 05)is still available here in Louisiana, but seems to be temporarily unavailbe through Amazon (what a shame - keep checking). If you need to make a roux, stuff a crab, or win the gumbo cookoff, this is your source. You may never need the Crawfish Stuffed Nutria Hindquarters recipe, but then again, you never know."
5,John Folse Does It Again,"A fun and fascinating book that does a great job of covering a multitude of recipes that are popular in the South. Colored tabs divide it into easy-to-use sections like ""Gumbo & Soups"", ""Seafood"", ""Meats"", ""Desserts"", ""Wild Game"", etc. The book also contains lovely color illustrations by the well-known Cajun artist George Rodrigue. Historical information is included which gives the recipes an added depth. This book is completely different from John Folse's huge 842-page tome with the same title and is much easier to use in the kitchen! If you are a John Folse fan then you will surely enjoy this book."
4,Too small,"I always wear a 2xl. I like my shirt to be just a little on the big side. However, this item is too snug to be comfortable. It is the only 2xl item I have ever worn that was too small."
4,"Soft, comfortable, breathes",My husband loves this shirt and asked me to order more. My only complaint is that it does wrinkle and needs to be ironed.
5,Baldurs Gate meets LOTR 2 towers,"I bought this today, and been playing it, and I seem to be enjoying it very much.This game combines both the graphics (graphics for this game are better although) and hack n slash game play of the LOTR 2 Towers game. Then combines it with the story of Baldurs Gate and The Forgotten Realms world.Another way to think of this game is Baldurs Gate up close 3rd person view, instead of the over head view that made everyting in the 2 Baldurs Gate games look small.If you enjoyed the Baldurs Gate games and the LOTR games, this is a must have game. The story is written than none other R. A. Salvatore himself!"
5,bluezmantom,"seen these guys a month ago for the first time - i was floored. these guys really can cook. listening to them i was thinking they sounded a little like the blasters, then they went into border radio - i freaked. it took me a month to find this cd and am still looking for their smoke cd. if you like rockabilly blues these are the guys for you."
4,"Buy this ""Today""!","I grew up listening to this on vinyl (my father had the album) and I had been waiting desperately for it to come out on CD. I believe this is a great live Kenton CD. The soloists are relative unknowns, but everything Kenton typically brought to the big band arena is here:Blistering trumpets: Check out what I think is the definitive version of ""Intermission Riff"" with either Mike Vax or Dennis Noday way up on top. Or the brief, yet effective version of ""Take The A Train"".Beautiful ballads: Check out ""Interlude"" or Richard Torres (tenor sax) on the Kern/Harbach classic ""Yesterdays""Other standout cuts are ""Fringe Benefits"" and ""Ambivalence""; there's even a version of ""God Save The Queen"". The trademark Kenton humor is in full force as well.The only negative is that the sound is a little muffled at times, but the music overrides any sonic defects."
3,"OK, but disappointing","Sonically the cd's didn't sound as good as many of the London Phase 4 I have. the label was Vocalion not Phase 4. I remember Vocalion as a cheap knock-off label from long ago. Second, the selections were a mix of Kenton standards and a some new (at least to me) titles. I thought that the originals were better from the past. Also, both cd's were live,I prefer studio soound. These cd's are OK but you might find better from the Kenton and Phase 4 catalogs."
2,Not as expected,"I have a toy Shih Tzu with medium size hair. I tried this product on my dog to avoid bathing her as often as I would like to. She was last bathed a week prior. I followed directions provided in the bottle. If my dog had short hair, maybe it would had work. When her hair was dried and combed, her hair looked dry and dull and a bit sticky. The smell took a turn to the worst. I had to bathe her again with oatmeal shampoo and conditioner to get rid of all the foam shampoo. Now she looks and feels clean, shinny fluffy hair and smelling good again. I do not recommend this product. I gave it a two stars rating just in case it works with short haired dogs. Good luck!"
2,Fans can never be objective...,From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...William Orbit needs to go back to the pulsating rhythms he does best and leave this music for airports period behind and back into the hands of Brian Eno.
4,i agree,"i completely agree with the previous reviewer in absolutely every aspect. i have heard works from all three of his pseudonyms as well as production and remixing, and have visited his website, only to be a bit dissapointed in the exclussion of the great songs composed with the likes of blur, beck, and beth orton. however, this is still a really good album which surpasses his pieces in a modern style album, but not really his other works."
2,Disappointing,"Compared to his earlier work, this is uninspired. Technically well executed but there is not one ""great"" track on here. I got it before they had the samples posted...ah well, maybe the next one will be worth the money. :-("
3,Fails to excite me...,"I keep listening to this album over and over again and it fails to excite me. I was one of the fans of Orbit that became acquainted with his music during the ""Strange Cargo"" period and through this work with Madonna later on. I also enjoyed his ""Pieces in a Modern Style"". But ""Hello Waveforms"" just failed to cut it for me. The opening track seems interesting at first, but the appeal becomes diluted easily and the album just becomes uninteresting and even a bit dated-sounding after the first few songs.I will continue to be on the lookout for Orbit's future works: I still have high hopes that he will continue to amaze us as he's done in the past."
3,Good Orbit selection,"The songs on this album transition very well. It is difficult to tell them apart. I purchased this album specifically for Fragamosia but have kept most of the songs and would listen to them regularly. This album is a good representation of William Orbit's softer side. It certainly sounds like Orbit, but is more relaxed than his commercial successes. A laid-back and well-mixed recording overall."
5,Waveforms,"More great music by William Orbit.No one else can touch him for the kind of music that he put,s out."
5,Outstanding,I fell in loved with a selection [...]. I could not find the cd in any store in my area. Found a copy listed on amazon.com and purchased it. It is now in my top ten of my cd collection. One of William Orbit's finest works.
3,"Where d'you go, Billy?","Just so-so. Nuthin to get worked up about.There are a few, a very few shiny Orbit moments, but for the most part this is too easily forgettable given his proven capabilities.I didn't like Pieces in a Modern Style because it sounded too contrived and too canned, and this is not that different. The other reviewer is right: it sounds a lot more like his last Torch Song foray than anything near his Strange Cargo masterpieces.The fake woodwind motifs he was known for used to be catchy and cool, now they just sound fake and blah.Billy, I hope Madonna hasn't muddied your creative waters. You got it, now get back to using it!"
2,Only if you like ambient music,"I heard a track on college radio and really liked it. Unfortunately, I found out after purchasing that there are only two or three tracks worth listening to.The rest are flat, monotonous and get to the point of driving you mad.Having experienced William Orbit's music before in the form of collaborations with Beth Orton (Water From a Vine Leaf), I expected more powerful, exciting music.The music seems to go nowhere. I keep expected it to get a little stronger, have some peaks and valleys... maybe some interesting sounds thrown in. But it does not happen.Even the one track with memorable vocals (the Sugababes) doesn't play right with me because her style of singing sounds more appropriate with R and B rather than ambient / electronica.If you are looking for ambient background music that breaks no new ground this may please you. But if you are expecting exciting and upbeat...pass on this one."
5,groovy garnet ring!,Recv'd my ring in a timely manner it looks very antique would recommend this ring to any garnet lover!
5,The bible of metering energy,"This is, no doubt, the best book about the theme. It is in all university book's list in the world. It shows since the basics things about metering till most moderns equipaments on the market."
5,thank you!!,"I wanna thank you very much for this beautiful item, i really enjoyed this film! I love this director movie !!"
4,everything you ever wanted to know about a sniper,"Everything you ever wanted to know about long distance shooting,but wouldn't live long enougth to gain the experience yourself. Topics from wind speed est. to types of cover,rifle types compsite stock vs wood. Barrel length, scope alingement"
5,Required reading for students of the Rifle & Marksmanship,"This book will teach you all you need to know about how to shoot or how to shoot better. I am just a citizen but this book provided straight forward information on rifles, ammunition, shooting, optics, spotting, observation, gear, with real world examples of the how and why of shooting. Yes, it's about sniping, but snipers are great observers, stalkers and shooters. You can apply information in this book to augment your hunting and shooting skills. It is absolutely must reading for all who desire to increase their knowledge of all aspects of shooting. It's easy to read and understand. Yet it's a cerebral collection of vital information that can be instantly applied. I thank the author for writing this book and for his service to his country."
2,Grain of salt,Our team was asked for assistance on the writing of this book we declined due to confidentiality issues and the authors attitude. Some information contained in the book is helpful and some is laughable (see what happens if you put a brass jag in sweets 7.62). Use caution if this book is your sole means of training. Take it all with a grain of salt...A big grain. S.O.T.I.C. 10th Special Forces Grp
5,Extremely detailed,"This book is the finest book I own on precision shooting. And I own quite a few. Maj. Plaster is a master at precision shooting and has given us the science of it in this book. This book scientifically teaches you how to put one bullet into a target at extreme ranges. It also teaches you about stalking, building hides, range estimation, counter sniping, mantracking, target priorities, camo in various environments, and something defensive books doesn't ever teach you, offensive tactics. I have probably read this book 3 times over, because there is so much detailed information in this book to learn. This book is written so that even the most unskilled shooter can understand. Survival and equipment section is just as informative. Buy this book before you buy or build your rifle, for it will open your eyes as to what to look for in a rifle and scope."
4,The Snipers Bible,"Highly recommended book on general sniping and shooting. With the exception of a step by step process of making a ghillie suit this book covers everything you need to know. It has a little on what to get for a ghillie suit and not a whole lot on how to correctly wrap burlap around your bolt action rifle with the scope on it though. Other then that it is a very good book. Must have. You will figure it all out anyway regarding the ghillie suit and camouflaging yourself and your weapon. If not, ask a professional sniper from the Army or USMC."
5,"Packs great info, covers a lot of ground. Worth having!","Lots of useful material, well assembled, nicely presented. This book covers pretty much all the aspects of what a sniper must learn to ply his trade. On top of the textbook knowledge, the author shares his own valuable experience.Summary: for those interested in sniping this is a very good book to own. If I had to have only one book on the subject, probably this would be it.I only wish for a sturdier cover! :)"
5,Outstanding Manual for the Serious Shooter,This book is the most comprehensive collection of data that pertains to the Military/Police Sniper. As a military Sniper I found details about rifle usage and even cleaning that just aren't taught to you in the US Army Sniper school. This book has definately tightened my groups. Thank you John Plaster!
5,Juba likes it.,"I bought this book because when I watched the Juba the Sniper movie they mentioned this book. During the video they interview the commander of the Baghdad sniper brigade he says this book is their main training manual. For all you who want to see theory applied to the real world downloand this movie, it shows about 25 attacks on US soldiers in Iraq. It will give you something to think about. What more do you need than real snipers saying they use this book?"
3,Ultimate Sniper VCR,"The book was ok but the video, I thought, was of poor quality. I'm a 'retired' photographer and this VCR had shadows on the faces, wind in the microphone to where sometime you could quite hear what was going on. It was rather amateur in my opinion......."
1,Ultimate Letdown,"This book is 50% product marketing, 45% regurgitated information easily found on the web, and 5% common sense. If you've been shooting a while, have done considerable independant research on your own, and possibly compete, you do not need this book. Its overpriced and un-necessary. This is one of those books that makes me think buying books is for fools, given the information age we live in. Theres no magical gems in here, and thats usually what people want when they finally spring for a book. The 5 star reviewers must be completely new to shooting."
2,'Advanced' for the dreamer/week-end warrior.,"This book unfortunately does not live up to the optimism or enthusiasm of the other reviewers or the title. ""My First Bumper Book of Playing Soldiers"" would probably be a better title in my opinion. The book covers a wide spectrum of concepts in the context of the title and is a reasonable light read but Ultimate will leave the professional disappointed."
1,Internet Regurg,Mr. Plaster just regurges internet retoric. I found nothing that I already knew or could find on the internet. I will continue to search for a book that reviews all of the dope needed to be more successful at long range shooting.
4,The Treasury of Celtic Knots,"I have begun only recently drawing Celtic knots. I recommend Celtic Knots - Mastering the Traditional Patterns as a first book for beginners. I am currently working on The Treasury of Celtic Knots and finding knots as clearly explained as Celtic Knots, although the knots are much harder for me to draw. That's my failing rather than Mr. Meehan's. I especially like the round knots although mine turn out not exactly round. Practice, practice, practice."
5,Better than Stanley,"Larger than the pliers hooks that came with the Stanley assortment. nothing more to say, but must meet the word requirement"
1,Worthless. Save your $5.95. Only one page.,"Worthless. Save your $5.95. Only one page. Definitely would NOT recommend. A lame review from someone who perhaps never even actually saw a Rune and certainly seems to have never ridden one, and quite possibly never rode any motorcycle. At first I was disappointed about the short length but then I realized I should be grateful given that it was so poorly done."
5,Authentic sound in a world of pop and rap,"Good outdoor / driving music. Traditional rhythms with a refreshing lack of special effects. These are tunes that are new and original but sound like the ones you listened to when you were 18, driving with the top down and barefoot or outside playing frisbee. Struck By Lightning sounds a bit too Huey Lewis for my tastes. I hear a lot of influences - a bit of a Dire Straits, a bit of Neil Young, John Cougar Mellencamp, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Traveling Wilburys, Los Lobos, New Riders of the Purple Sage. This is a band whose is well-suited for music that avoids the techno grunge of the 90's and today. Somebody who appreciates the slide guitar but can't keep replaying all of the Lynrd Skynrd.They are clearly a band that has a pronmising future for those who would like to listen to a more traditional sound in the current musical environment."
5,Awesome and Rockin!!,"""Struck By Lightning"" rocks!! When you play it be prepared to move to the incredible rhythm! It is a great collection of fast and upbeat mixed with soulful melodies. It really is a cd for every kind of music taste of all ages. I highly recommend it."
4,Great Album,"3.5/5Chicago native Rhymefest made a very good album with his debut, Blue Collar. Rhymefest displays a variety of emotions on this album, transitioning skillfully from heavy to light subject matter at times. Fest's creative story-writing and telling abilities along with his unique flow are omnipresent throughout the whole album, making it a great listen. Standout tracks include the conscientious ""All I Do,"" the brash street single ""Chicago-Rillas,"" the braggadocio ""Dynomite"" song (although the original version was much better), and ""More,"" a song with a valuable message that features Kanye West on the hook."
4,Hip Hop Fest,"Rhymefest is a new artist from Chitown and I actually think it's one of the hottest albums I bought recently though I accept I owned it way too later than it came out. Kanyeezy helped him a lot on this album, also he has a distinct rappin style, so positive and happy! Big ups for this.."
1,Wack,"Rhymefest is an Ok rapper and the first two joints are bumping. Man, I thought I was in for a classic hip hop album , It was like the Lakers wereahead by 30 points then all of a sudden the other team caught up and eventually won the game because after that it was just wack track after wack track. I admire his thought provoking lyrics but if the beat ain't hittin I could care less what you're rapping about. Rhymefest used so many R&B; singers I thought I was listening to some old New Edition or After 7 joints not that I don't like those singers but I don't want to hear that on no hip hop album. If you want to hear some real Chicago hip hop check out All Natural the best besides Common to ever come from the city of wind."
3,Great while it lasts,"Initially these worked very well for me, I got a few compliments, and they really do sound good. Sadly they lasted barely a year, but that may have been due to the fact that my amplifier went haywire. Overall a decent product."
1,Juicing Nightmare,"Yes, I agree with the reviews about delicious juice. However, this machine is an absolute horror to clean. It also has no safety switch and will start when not completely assembled. You must unplug the juicer for safety, which is recommended for all electrics anyway. It easily clogs up and makes a disgusting mess. I would not recommend this juicer to anyone. My Omega was and is a far superior juicer."
1,Prepared to be sorely disappointed!!!,"This isn't the greatest resource out there on the topic. It's poorly produced and it begins with a rated R, maybe NC-17 scene of some vamps feeling each other up but no real sexual activity. The rest is common knowledge information on historic figures of real vampires, such as Vlad the Impaler. Sad to say, the only highlight of this documentary, is when someone was getting pierced by a needle...yeah something to get all excited about. This isn't worth spending money on, unless you plan on waiting for someone to sell their used copy for a lower price (like for a dollar) and even then, you're better off spending your time and money else where. Buy yourself vamp porn and look at vampire material from the history channel, you'll have yourself this documentary but with better enjoyment and higher quality."
4,Mexican film noir . . .,"The intricate plot of this thriller keeps you guessing from moment to moment as it takes sudden and unexpected turns involving corrupt police and government officials and a young couple with a baby who are inadvertently involved in a political assassination. This film goes quite gladly over the top as it pushes the envelope of credibility, and it might be even more gleefully thrilling if the rising crime rates and levels of violence in Mexico didn't tend to support the view we get of it. Be forewarned, there's plenty of melodrama - picture a young woman escaping from police detention with a gun in one hand and a baby in the other. Then hang onto your hat."
5,My personal favourite Colin Hay record,"Why this record wasn't a big success is yet another piece in the ""Why isn't Colin Hay bigger than Sting?"" mystery. Every song is strong, there's not a weak one in the bunch, no ""filler"" like most artists put on records. The lyrics are pithy, moving, smart and observant as only Colin Hay can write. ""Waiting For My Real Life To Begin"" was exactly where I was at when I bought this and remains for me the most meaningful. ""Woman's Face"" is a real man's view of female beauty. ""Lost Generation"" uses the title of the WW2 generation as irony for the lost ""Gen Xers"" who whine about being well off. ""Oooh Oooh Oooo Baby"" made my girlfriend cry because it was something that I had done and just made her think of me when I was away from her. That's a testament to the honest stories and genuine lyrics Colin Hay writes."
4,Hay is the Best-Kept Secret in Popular Music,"You don't know me, but you can trust me when I say, this album is a great addition to your collection. I especially liked ""I Don't Miss You Now"" and ""Woman's Face."" I also highly recommend his latest album ""Transcendental Highway."" Hay is the one of the best singer/songwriters of his generation. Join the few who know him--buy this album! Trust me!Alex G. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma"
2,Not by Commander X,"First, the titles of the reviews by Irridium (Disappointing) and Radion (Not Much Of A Lesson) sum up my thoughts as well.But my problem is that this book, or at least the edition I bought here on Amazon (and also the one pictured in their listing, is not by and has no affiliation with Commander. As a fan of Commander X and his work that was the only reason I bought this dinky little 93 page booklet. I've long suspected that Inner Light publisher Timothy Green Beckley is actually the mysterious Commander X. Is that what you are saying Amazon? I don't see any connection to Commander X in this book unless there is a newer edition then the one I received and the one pictured here."
4,WORTH IT!,"This CD is worth the money for track 6 alone, Mondo Bongo's Alone. Everytime I hear it, I see Brad and Angelina fighting and then making up. It is the song for lovers who have lost their way."
5,Romantic and fun...,"This made a wonderfull valentines gift for my Girlfriend and also nice romantic and fun background music. She has since put it on her mp3 player (of course) and she ejoys all the songs. Mr. and Mrs. Smith was enjoyable both as a movie, (because it was a chickflick I could make it through) and as a songtrack (Because the music is wonderfull!) Good buy, oh and good music to slow dance or heck, tango to!"
4,Enjoyed the film? Enjoy the soundtrack.,"Album booklet: a tri-fold layout, with various artist credits and photos from the film.Great soundtrack with great songs from the movie and 'inspired' for the movie.""Assassin's Tango"" (on the soundtrack) is also ""Tango De Los Asesinos"" on the (""Mr and Mrs Smith"") score cd (only the score's version is about 25 seconds longer) - I'd recommend the film score if you enjoyed the film."
4,Answer for Marina,"To Marina: the name of the song is ""(Who Discovered) America?"" it's by this band called Ozomatli off of the album Street Signs. They're pretty cool!"
5,Completely Captures the Unique Charm and All The Songs!!!,"Just got my copy of the album! It has all the best songs from the film plus more tunes that completely fit the vibe and feel of the movie. Completely captures the fun feeling of the story (in the same tounge-in-cheek way).I'm so glad that ALL THE SONGS from the best scenes in the film are on the album, like ""Express Yourself"" during the MR AND MRS SMITH fighting scene!Totally great collection of songs. Probably the best soundtrack I've bought since Garden State. I just love all the new versions of these songs. An instant classic soundtrack!Standouts for me are the new versions of I Melt With You and Used To Love (but I had to kill her). Who knew that mixing covers of songs orginally by Modern English, Guns & Roses, Bon Jovi, and Bob Dylan (to name a few) would work so well and be so amazing.Great soundtracks are few and far between these days and this is definately one of them! A must have for it's unique charm (much like the film itself)."
3,holayy!,"Well, the movie was fab, so I thought I'd check out the soundtrack, and wow... it was quite something. I liked it, but does EVERY star-crossed-lovers movie's soundtrack have to have ""Tainted Love"" on it?"
4,An older version of Juan Gabriel,"Although the concert was in VHS format and therefore not visually as clear as I would want, the concert was Wonderful!! Juan Gabriel was younger then (weren't we all!) and delivered his typically enthusiastic, energetic performance. His stamina was amazing! The accompanying musicians and dancers were so enjoyable. We will treasure this tape forever! Thanks so much!"
4,This is a concert that caused a great controversy.,"The Palacio de Bellas Artes (Fine Arts Palace) is located in Mexico City. Usually, it was used for fine arts (cult music concerts, opera and expositions) until Juan Gabriel, also called ""Juanga"" for the people, sang there. That concert caused a national controversy. Personally, I do not like his music, but if you want to hear one of the most prolific Mexican composers, idol of the people, you must see this video. The architecture of the Palacio de Bellas Artes is very impressionant."
3,informative book,"this is a good informative book, im not much into reading so I didnt read it from cover to cover but it a good book and worh the money I think."
3,Good book for beginners but lacking in real techniques.,"This book is actually a bit on the boring side. It's basically a how to guide on just about all the games you can play. It goes really in depth into the rules and how to play the games. There are some strategies on how to play to win, but I just couldn't quite get it. I prefer Frank Scoblete's writing style and content a lot more. It's a good basic book but if you already know how to play then you may want to pass on this one."
4,can this be pinned up on a flat target?,My husband says this looks like a nice target of good quality (though he hasn't used it yet). I just wanted to post that in the picture & item description it appears it can be stretched over a round target or pinned up on a flat target (hay bales)... but the one sold here has elastic for stretching over a target... I'm not sure how to make it flat without cutting some of the elastic. ???
4,Pretty good - Not great,"Compared to the awesome harmonies of groups like Westlife and the Backstreet Boys, these guys fall a little short. But, I guess you have to take into account how long ago the album was recorded and what music was like then. (The Backstreet Boys first album was nowhere as good as their last, either). Give that, the album is good, the songs are catchy, and the four guys really can sing. I would recommend it to anyone who likes ""boyband"" style music."
4,Garfield's CD is pretty kool- get it while its hot!,"DJ Garfield (Garfield is his first name) brings out an amazing sound with his first release in the US. The UK native puts together an brilliant combination of House and Trance. The music is so energetic that it can keep anyone up for hours. My fave tracks on it are ""Free"" and ""Mental Atmosphere."" All in all, I would recommend this album to any club hopper out there."
4,A good example of quality 80s Eurodance,"Radiorama has always been one of my favourite bands. It is perfect Italo disco that rocked the clubs from the mid-80s when this duo got together. They have a distinctive style adding some ""weight"" to Euro-disco. Great tunes and vocals with a dramatic twist in their songs. My favourites are the club anthems from their first two releases, songs like ""Desire,"" ""Aliens,"" ""Yeti."" Get this one or their 1986 and 1987 albums. You won't regret!"
1,So frustrated...,"I had ordered the this CD because my daughter and I had attended the play in London and the cover art shown was identical to the program we had gotten at the theater.I thought it would be a great gift to give her along with the program and ticket stubs. As was mentioned in the previous comment, what I received was the version with David Cassidy, Sean Cassidy, and Petula Clark. When I called to complain, I was told that that was the cover art that was provided by the distributor. I am returning the CD unopened."
1,Wrong Album,The cd that amazon sends is not the cd pictured or listed. It is not the original cast recording it is a version with David and Shaun Cassidy. If you want the actual original cast get it somewhere else.
5,Excellent,"I used this light in Afghanistan and after 6 months of everyday use I am still on the original battery. It's compact, easy to carry but powerful. Convenient to be able to switch to red/green/white lenses. There is nothing bad about this light."
3,"It's good enough, not great","First, I bought this thinking it was a full-sized flashlight, but that's just my fault for being boneheaded.It still worked out well as a light for camping. The small size and clip made it easy to clip it to the brim of my hat and use it as a headlamp (although adjusting color or turning it on and off required me to unclip it.) The color wheel is handy and the light is really useful for spotting things in the dark. The single LED, though, isn't very bright. So it's utility is mainly as a secondary light. But for $20. . . that's a bit steep. I would still like it, but I'm not sure I'd have been willing to pay that price had I known."
3,"Great concept, poor quality control","I ordered two of these. One of them is perfect, the other has a sloppy bezel ring at the front where you change the color filters. It works, but you can tell it isn't right. The other light has a nice, firm bezel engagement. Basically I paid for two lights and got one that is not defective. If I wanted to spend that sum, I would have bought a different light, one good $35 light instead of one good and one shoddy $17 ea. light. I wouldn't recommend buying one of these unless you can return it locally if you get a bad one. I thought that by buying a Gerber I would avoid this kind of sloppy QC."
1,Insuficient light,"One white led, four filters. For the light you get from the only white led, you can get a lighter flashlight. The use of any color filter is so dim, it's useless. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,not what i was expecting,Did not really care for this product. Seems very small and cheap and the light quality is poor. I was disappointed.
2,small,item was smaller than expected there was a photo but no size in inchesshipping charges were high and item is just 3 inches in length could be shipped in smaller boxnot satisfied
3,Gerber Recon,"Pros- solid construction, color options, 20+ hour run time with one AA battery.Cons- only 4 lumens white light, reduced with the color filters.As with one other reviewer, I purchased this for use in areas where there is a need for other than white light, and really expected something more along the lines of 10-15 lumens, but that's my fault for not doing more checking before I purchased. The red filter provides sufficient light for map-reading (the green is too bright), and probably provides sufficient light to walk by if your eyes have had time to adjust and you're moving slow, but if you're moving quickly or moving from lit areas to darkness, it doesn't provide sufficient output."
3,Not Bright,Just purchased this flash light for a up coming deployment and I was kind of let down on how not bright it is.
3,low intensity,"Everything I like about this Flashlight, from design to feasability, structurual integrity however the strength of the light is very weak. So unless you are in a pitchblack area this light won't do much.Being in the military we have used ""Surefire""., they offer similar if not the same as the Gerber 22-80016 but with lumens up to 8500"
3,For limited use only,"This is one wimpy light, and the screw to turn-on is a little annoying (definitely not speed friendly). BUT, I left it on accidentally for 4 days and it was still burning as bright as it could. So battery life is excellent with such a low discharge rate. Also, it will serve it's purpose if ever needed = opsec in the dark. But I do think it's overpriced for this purpose."
4,Pretty cool light,"I really like the multiple color options for different uses. Feels quality made. I wish it was brighter, and had an on off switch instead of turning the rear to turn on/off."
5,Wonderful classic,"Lord Dunsany published ""King of Elfland's Daughter"" in 1924, and it's as fresh now as it must have been then. Dunsany uses slightly archaic language, but tells this story of love lost and regained in beautiful tones. His sense of the magical, of experiences beyond what the human world can offer, comes through more clearly than any other writer could have managed. Hunting for sport, the hero's great delight, appeals to me not at all, but even that couldn't cancel out the enjoyment I found in every other part of this story.But, more than the story itself, Lord Dunsany's classic can also be read as a founding document of modern fantasy. According to the cover blurbs, he influenced Arthur Clarke, Yeats, L. Sprague de Camp, Andre Norton, and many others who've led the way in recent fantasy. It's interesting to see how things ahve changed since this was written, but it's also quite remarkable to see an original influence behind so many newer and more familiar stories.-- wiredweird"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Elves and princesses.And for me, not much of interest to be found.This isn't a bad book, just a dull one. The archaic style will certainly be a turnoff to some readers.Human man meets elf princess, culture clash, etc."
1,Overrated,"I bought this based on the effusive praised heaped by other reviewers here, but it was a waste of time and money. Don't bother unless you like your plots thin, your prose repetitive (if I read ""palace that may only be told of in song"" one more time I swear I am going to hurt someone) and your characterization feeble.Of historical interest only."
1,Not a Very Exciting Story!,"Save your money! This got good reviews, so I decided to tryit. And I'm sorry I did. The story is not very exciting, doesn't make you want to turn to the next page & continue reading & its just, well...dull. None of the characters are particularly interesting either, the author doesnt tell nearly enough about them to make you care what they do. So save your money. If you think you might be interested in reading it...get it from a friend, the library or a used bookstore first. Spend your money on something really good like Stardust by Neil Gaiman or any Piers Anthony novel."
3,Classic of fantasy,"A book that many attribute as the start of modern fantasy. The downside to this, being that so many stories have used this for inspiration that it can seem predictable, but still an interesting read for tales of a far off land and magic."
3,For Dub Heads,"As a dub purist, I feel I should warn all dub-heads about thisCD. The front & back covers are very seductive for dub-heads, but be warned: there is no clue on the outside that this CD isLOADED with vocals; and if you're a dub-purist, you probablyprefer your dub clean of vocals. Once you open the CD, 5 of 12 songs are actually labeled as having vocals, so you breathe a sigh of relief and program for the other 7 songs...only to find, to your dub-purist revulsion: even THOSE songs have too many vocals. So, while the music itself is quite good, Dub-Heads should be warned that this CD has WAY WAY WAY too many vocals to truly be considered a ""dub"" CD."
4,Supersoul Stylin',"RUOK- remixed, redefined, redone. If you like RUOK this is another great installment on the MBM catalog. If you have a surround sound system, look into the DVD as well. Music in a synthetic form never sounded so good. If you like the Manifesto and Mr. Dangers himself this disc is not to be overlooked."
1,Battered: That's how I FELT in trying to read this text.,"Maybe some of the problem was the used textbook I purchased, but I really don't think so. The fonts used in this text was so small that it made reading tiresome and full of eye strain. The subject matter is important and people do need to understand, but no one, other than someone locked up with nothing else to read, could possibly endure this book.I'll find another on the subject. To the author: come down off your high horse and write like a caring person.... not a cold harded scientist!These women deserve more."
2,Lots of money for lots of weiners - you can do better locally.,I like smoked meats and gourmet meats - I buy them in the LA area at various brick and mortar stores and I am seldom disappointed. I tried this gift box and was surprised at the mix of meats - small packages of interesting stuff and a couple pounds of weiners. Far more plain old hot dogs than any other item. At almost $50 it's a bad buy.
5,Very impressed with wisconsinmade,"Fed ex lost my order to my mother for Christmas. Wisconsinmade helped me out and reshipped a new package at no extra fee. They even rushed shipped it. I can't vouch for the quality ( although I hear its great) but am thoroughly impressed with Ilene and the wisconsinmade staff! Great job, I will be back soon!!"
2,Disappointing!,"This wreath is not as pretty as it looked online. The leaves and blossoms are not really very realistic looking. And there are a bit too many lights for the size of the wreath. What I'd expected to be an attractive little wall decor to brighten up a dark area in my dining room, is instead something actually a bit tacky."
1,Superficial But Well-Written,"I agree with the negative reviews below. The author, while skilled with the written word, is a cultural tourist who never quite grasps the essence of what is around her. And, yes, her ignorance of ""samba"" is annoying. For me, this book was a waste of money."
2,samba,"For an author whose first language is spanish, her skill in writing in english has to be commended -but she ain't Borges. Planning a research trip/adventure for a year in Rio, and then writting about her life there obviously demonstrates Guillermoprieto's ability to earn money by doing what she likes. Her style is journalistic and if you've never visited a third world country you can get a good idea from her observations of what living in one, as an average citizen, is like, eg. people accustomed to little prosperity evidently will go to great lengths for entertainment, and to achieve a feeling of importance. If you want to learn about samba, well- guillermoprieto is not omniscient. Conclusion: If you want to read something, you could do a lot worse than this book, but it's not a keeper. get it from the library."
2,Terribly written,"As a student who had to read this book for a class and think critically about it in terms of Anthropology and race, this book was a pain to sludge through. The writer's style is very ambiguous and confusing at times. With that said I did like the topic but I believe there are better books out there. I have no idea how to analyze this book for an essay!"
1,Disappointing for the Music Fan,"In my opinion, the author is an outsider who never really gets fully inside Mangueira and the cultural context of the samba school (escola de samba). She is definitely a ""gringa"" who has much to learn and misinterprets much of what she sees. But the worst part of the book I think is her horrible reporting on ""samba"" itself -- the music, the dance and the history of the genre. She doesn't know what she's talking about, and even at one point reports that all the Brazilian idioms with a 2/4 meter are variations of the same thing! Please...."
1,So-So Sociology and Terrible Musicology,"""Samba"" is a pretty good read, but evidentally the author only spent a short time in Brazil doing her research. It's very superficial in terms of cultural and racial issues. And its musical analysis is WAY off the mark. She knows nothing about samba. There are much better books out there about samba and Brazilian music."
5,what can i say,this record rocks but it seems like most ''embodyment'' fans don't wich is very sad i have not herd lots of ''embodyments'' music but this is a very strang change from the first cd they put out wich whas death metal with sounds of bands ''living sacrifice'' and ''soul embraced'' but the new record ''hold your breath'' is more like ''Morning View'' by ''Incubus'' wich most ''Incubus'' fans don't like ether but i think this cd rocks so buy it eny way it rocks.
1,Be careful-warehouse doesn't check book titles,This might be a great book. I wouldn't know since I was sent the wrong book - one on dressage horse training - twice. I called and alerted the customer service desk that the book I received had the same bar coding as the book I requested per the invoice in the box. I was assured that the warehouse personnel would check titles...and then I received the wrong book again.
1,Don't Buy From Them,"They said the book was new. It was NOT. I purchased it to give as a gift, a wedding gift no less, and it arrived totally used. I was very dissappointed. I would not buy from this seller."
4,Good book!,"Me & my wife haven't had much time to read it yet, but scanning through it....it has a lot of great ideas!! Look forward to putting some of the. To good use!!"
4,"Works, but LOUD!","Pro:- compact- works fine (1500W)- auto mode allows temperature control- has shut-off timer- rotates automaticallyCon:- the 120mm fan in the back makes a lot of noise- the area in front of the grille gets extremely hot, so be careful"
4,Good little heater,"I got this for under my desk at work, and i love the thermostat and the timer functions. Used it as the main heat source in my pop-up trailer this weekend to conserve propane and it worked great, my wife never complained about the cold. Downside is that it does not turn off if tipped over. If it did I would give it 5 stars. I am about to buy another because the wife won't let me take mine out of the trailer..."
1,Dispenser is terrible!,"I like 3 in 1 oil but I hate this dispenser. My biggest complaint is with the nozzle that has a pull-on push-off style tip that gets easier and easier to operate with time. After using it a while the mechanism quickly becomes worn and then the slightest pressure on the tip will cause it to close. In practice this means that I have to keep the tip hovering over the work because the moment it touches, the oil stops flowing."
2,Use if fast before it leaks everywhere,"I had one of these. The oil is fine, but after a few months, the bottle leaked and the oil ended up everywhere. I never damaged the bottle so it must be made with the wrong plastic or something.Going back to a metal can."
1,"Second the above, avoid this product","I second all these negative reviews. This can works a few times and then fails. Oil comes out of all the the connections except the tip.3-in-One is a fine oil. Save yourself some heartbreak. Buy the big 3-in-1 can with the ordinary tip for $3 less. Then use the $3 you save to buy a metal can with an extended tip -- the cheapest one with a reasonable amazon rating. I found many with the search string ""oil can"". Then just empty some of the oil from the large can into it. That will give you an extended tip with some control and the original 3-in-1 can with its convenient short tip that will suit most needs."
1,Worst product design since the lawn dart,"The telescoping spout is an abject disaster: it's hard to tell if the cap is open or closed, telescoping the spout back into the container causes oil to seep onto the neck of the bottle, and if the container falls on its side a slippery mess is guaranteed. Look for 3-in-1 oil in the container your father used; it's the wise choice."
2,the telescoping spout,3-in-one oil is an old brand and the oil itself is fine. Just a regular fine penetrating oil. The can with the telescoping spout is a disaster. This has to be the least ergonomic oil container in existance. There is no way that I can find to despense the oil with out using two hands on the container. That leaves no free hand to hold any small item to be oiled. Please bring back the old flat sided metal can that clicks out the oil when you squeeze it.
1,Dispenser that doesn't need to exist.,"Fortunately I haven't wasted my money buying my 3-in-One oil in this dispenser.I have been using 3-in-One oil for over 60 years with great satisfaction.I was visitng my 94 year old mother and she asked me to oil the hinges on her back door. She produced the subject 3-in-one dispenser for me to use.Wherever she purchased it, it was the only 3-in-oil oil dispenser they carried.What a joke. A straw is unnecessary for most uses of 3-in-one oil."
1,"Great Product, Terrible packaging. Don't buy this","3-in-1 oil is indispensable whenever you have anything mechanical around. However, when you combine the oil with this cheaply-made, poorly designed bottle, you get oil that is un-dispensable.The telescoping feature seems like a good idea, but then you realize that you have to use it, or no oil comes out. The tube will always be covered in oil, so it makes a mess. The red plastic cap is poorly sealed, and the tip falls off or comes open, leaking oil everywhere.Get this in a different package and you will not regret it."
5,Better than most adaptions of the unpublished story.,"There are several different re-tellings of the famous unpublished case for which ""the world was not yet ready"". I thought the lack of Watson would affect these books, but it dosen't! Filled with mystery, intriuge, and suspense. Read it whether you like Holmes or not."
5,Colin has done it again....,I discovered Colin Hay about a year ago when a friend introduced me to his solo work. Since then I have seen him play live a couple of times. This CD is some of his best work. The lyrics of the songs grab ahold of you and don't let you go. I would recommend this CD to anyone who has ever loved or been loved. He grabs the essence of love and life and spins a beautiful tale. You will be doing yourself a favor by owning this music.
2,"Great voice and guitar, but the songs are lacking","I know I'm the only one who didn't like this album. I listened through it once and loved the sound of his voice and the guitar. But I thought the lyrics and songs were just lame. I was looking forward to this album after hearing one of the songs on the ""Garden State"" sound track but I was pretty disappointed and sold the CD after one listen through. It's not music you can just have in the background. It's pace is such that you really listen to the words and unfortunately the songs just didn't do it for me. I truly wish he could get some great song writing because otherwise, his voice is great."
3,Nothing More Than Middling,"I don't dislike this cd. But, all things considered, Men At Work were a great band and this offering by anyone else other than the leader of that great band would get no notice at all. The sound is right out of the 80's which is not bad in itself, and, Colin Hay has a good voice and good songwriting skills, but, it doesn't amount to much as a whole. There is nothing fresh and exciting in what I would call artistic creativity. This is probably why he hasn't had any critical acclaim as a solo act. Sorry, Colin, you were great with MAW. Better to concentrate on your acting career. There are probably more challenges in that direction for you rather than rehashing your personal life in songs."
2,Good for just starting but no depth for intermediate and beyond,"This documentary was a nice start for those just getting interested in documentary filmmaking, but each topic was so shallow that anyone who has read at least one book ( I recommend Barry Hampe) would feel this was not contributing much. That said it was still nice to watch and the insights by veteran doc producers was enjoyable. Not long enough or deep enough for the price I paid (29.95) but may be a good tool for those teaching intro to documentary film."
1,yuk,"First off, I didn't realize I was buying 48 packages of Red Vines....more importantly they taste GROSS and are not returnable. what a mistake."
2,Twizzlers are much better,I'm surprised that previous reviewers thought highly of the Red Vine taste. My Grandkids and I agreed that Twizzlers have a much better taste and texture. The Red Vines have a chemical aftertaste. I'm giving away the 23 remaining packages of Red Vines.
5,Better Than Twizzlers,"I mean.. Twizzlers are delicious and everything. But Red Vines are classic, and just can't be beat. The only thing that comes close, is that delicious red Australian Licorice that's really chewy. Mmmm. :)"
1,so disappointed,"its first time write a review,ordered 5 boxes of them (120 packages), expiration till Jan.7 2012 only,and its not returnable. so disappointed."
5,this is a new release and the sound quality is fab,"one of the reviews printed here was from 2000 this release is 2009amazon got this wrong.this cd has never sounded better so this 2000review is null and void,another great 80s sounding cd.STATE OF THE HEARTanother great 80s type of song that should have been a hit as well as a little gem called I DONT WANT TO WANT YOU superb ballad .again HENRY SMALLgreat vocalist this incarnation of PRISM was a bunch of top notch studio musicians with the addition of small.the recipe was perfect but no air play.really good collection.FINE one of the extra tracks could also have been a hit in 83/84."
3,Good case study,This book is very interesting in detailing what went wrong with the revolution and how it turned against itself. The book deals in depth with the origin of the terror and its consequences. It would not be advised as a book for somebody looking for a general history of the revolution due to its narrow scope.
4,Full Pantry,"After a frantic store search for canning books, I came to Amazon.com and found this treasure. I had bags, buckets and bowls full of homegrown produce and fruit and no idea of what to do with any of it since my only canning book was hopelessly outdated. This book was a gem. The recipes are easy to follow, require only a minimal of on-hand ingrediants and truly, any ""idiot"" can follow these directions.So with the help of this book, I now have a full pantry and several beautiful jars of jelly, jams and preserves to give as holiday gifts.By this way, this is the first time I have ever made jam and jelly that has actually ""set"". The directions were that specific.Have fun with this recipes in this book."
3,An acceptable book on jam!,"This book is an acceptable or average book on making jams. There are better preserving books. I think too many people purchase books based on their so-clever or cute name/title (like dummy or idiot). Better to look over the book carefully yourself and see what books the experts are recommending. I'd probably give this book a 3 1/2, but they didn't have that here and a 4 seemed too generous."
4,"Better than the first, but ...","As with the first book by Cover, part of the reason it's so good is that he's parroting the Graphic Novel by J. Michael Stracynski, practically word-for-word. The first third of the novel is additional material covering the nine years after the big events in the previous books, on the anniversary of The Surge, and the climactic battle that caused it. Frankly I feel that a book could have been dedicated to each year in between, fleshing out some of the characters (and perhaps focusing on some of the lesser known characters -- this is a HUGE ensemble starting at the beginning with 113 ""specials""). Once we get to the 10th Anniversary, Cover starts parroting Stracynski's work again, and there is very little additional information, and again we might as well have just read the Graphic Novel."
5,Simply Perfect,"I've never seen the original, but this TV version was truly mezmerizing. I love Jessica Lange so I am biased when it comes to her performances. However, I had such compassion for her portrayal of Blanche. She portrays the character as such a lost and troubled soul. You feel a sence of impending doom building throughout the film which is satisfied by the film's explosive climax. The entire cast is first-rate and seem to compliment each other's performance. I could watch this one over and over."
4,A streetcar named desire takes 2,Some movies shouldn't be touch. But hollywood did a good job with this film. Jessica Lange did a great job as the half dim-witted sister Blanche Dubois. I loved it.
2,"Non-Stick, but not non-chipping","The non-stick material cracks and peels off of the spade. May be good for light use, but I would not recommend this product for any type of heavy or commercial usage."
4,"Says what it does, does what it says","Spades are very effective at getting hard or soft ice cream, sorbet and sherbets out of any carton or bucket. This has a nice weight and comfortable handle, and the surface is appropriately slick/smooth for keeping your dessert in the bowl, not on the spade. You won't get the perfect parlor 'scoops' out of this shape, if that's important to you.I have no idea if the anti-freeze core makes this model any more effective, but it's a good choice and not very expensive. I don't mind hand-washing it (required to keep the core safe) for frequent use!"
2,Don't like it.,"So I'm watching this movie and I really dislike the main character, maybe it's because I'm not Jewish, I just can't relate to allowing everyone to walk all over you like pretty much everyone in his life does. He is basically a cuckold being that his wife is obviously cheating on him and he's too stupid to realize what's right in front of his face. How this man has gone through life being so passive and unassertive is something I would rather die than have to suffer through myself. Mind you that I haven't finished watching the movie yet, I've somehow gotten through an hour of it, but it's just so gd boring."
3,okay movie.,"It is an okay movie, I think. It is an okay movie, I think. It is an okay movie, I think."
2,did not enjoy this film,"I am not jewish so I did not understand the humor in this film. It was very boring for me, seemed like a lot of whining going on. listening to the hebrew language was distracting for me."
1,Bombastic and absolutely worthless,"I'm a big fan of the Coen brothers but this is by far their worst and easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. It had some interesting moments, but there was no story. I guess that's how it was designed and I'm just not deep enough to appreciate it. The characters are entirely forgettable. The performances are good, but it all amounts to a train wreck of pseudo-intellectual post modern hogwash."
1,"What to make of this misfire, worse movie of the decade?","I have enjoyed every one of the Coen brothers movies, and can sit through just about anything (as this movie once again proved), but this is surely a misfire and I have no idea why this is so highly rated. All style and no substance, they have taken the approach that way less is more and this movie is the equivalent of watching paint dry. And then, for good measure, it pulls an oh so artistic ending a-la ""The Sopranos"" which leaves you feeling kicked in the gut. You'll never get this hour and a half back. ""The Shipping News"" for me will always be the worse movie ever made, but this one is close to being the worse of the decade. Please spare me the ""you just didn't get it, it's so profound"" bull. Whatever existential meaning this carries could have been conveyed on a postage stamp. I'm just warning you that haven't seen it yet, you may feel enlighted and self important for choosing this one, but you'll hate yourself later."
2,A Serious Letdown,"Big disappointment from Joel and Ethan Coen, who deliver a Jewish black comedy that is all setup and no payoff. ""A Serious Man"" (2009) has its virtues - Michael Stuhlbarg's engaging performance and the artful cinematography of Roger Deakins. All for naught, since the Coens keep the audience at arm's length while switching stylistic gears too often. A maddeningly abrupt conclusion ruins the entire film. Deeply personal yet oddly detached by Coen standards."
4,What's all the fuss?,"A lot of words have been spilled out these review pages about the supposed esoteric nature of this film. Yes the protagonist is Jewish, and yes one does need to have an appreciation for droll humor, but if these are not obstacles to your viewing enjoyment, this is a straightforward, funny movie. The vast majority of viewers will easily relate to the problems that life brings into the protagonist's way. The ending does require an appreciation for the Jewish aversion to wrapping up something as complex as the human dilemma into a nice little package. The Christian worldview is intrincically more optimistic than that arising from diaspora Jewry. This last is no reason to not find humor, or interest, in the Jewish view of life; a view which does have some merit. (Author of this review is Gentile)."
2,Worst Movie Ending EVER!,"Seriously, the worst ending to a movie I've ever seen. EVER! Watch it yourself, you'll see. The movie was both terrific and disappointing on many levels, but on account of the ending it gets 2 stars. I hated the ending so much, I almost gave it one star. And I'm a Coen brothers fan. At least I was, but maybe no more because Burn After Reading also smelled - really bad."
1,not for me,"Some people seem to really like it, but there was no real plot and the dialogue immensely boring. I stopped watching 45 minutes into the film; good thing I rented it on Amazon for minimal effort and cost."
2,seriously pointless,"another movie that there was no point to make but these guys are movie makers so they have to make a movie every year. the story is about not much of anything and goes nowhere and tries to have a few twists and laughs, which largely fall short, or to be meditative about life, or not really, or invoke god, but not really, and then swear. really nothing"
2,Dry,"A movie that is drier than metaphysics lecture. Wonderfully shot and acted, but the brother needs to put down the philosophy books before working on there next project."
2,A serious waste of time,"Although I usually enjoy coen brothers movies, this one never really comes to any sort of end,almost none of the numerous subplots has any resolution."
1,I may be a Goy but I am not a smuck,"I had to counter the deep thinkers that have some how analyzed this totally plot less wanderings to be worthy of comment. After reading one review that claimed this travesty to art was ""witty and engaging (containing) lessons (that)are true and wise (and we should )Be ready for a little action, a few contemplative chuckles, and a lot of food for thought"". I can only say, finish your Tom and Jerry comic and get a book with words."
1,Rather have hemorroid surgery without anesthesia,"This has to be the worst film made in the last 100 years. Ugly, abhorrent, painful, disgusting and a waste of resources. Sure hope these two sociopaths are being watched. Children and pets are certainly not safe around them. Felt neither sympathy, concern or interest in any of the characters or their actions or activities. Not a moment of humor throughout the entire ordeal. I would have found more pleasure in calling up roto-rooter and having them come over and perform anal surgery without anesthesia than have to watch this again. I, unfortunately, give the benefit of the doubt to people and I believed the reviews on the dvd box - thief, liar, pervert! I kept hoping the chipper/shredder from their Fargo movie would show up and all the characters and the Coen cretins would dive in and we would finally have something to cheer about! Unfortunately you can not return a dvd just because it's a rotten movie. Call the cops. I've been robbed!"
2,Off-Beat Characters Don't Make a Film,We have the usual off-beat very distinct characters. There is not much of a plot though and the movie moves really slow. The ending is a let down without really bringing the movie to a conclusion. I think the writers were trying to make a fable set in the 1960's. There are minor plot lines that don't come together in the end or lead to a climax. This movies moves as slow as the main characters life. Larry Gopnik's life is just a series of lower lows with nothing to make us care or have much interest in his life. I like the Coen Brothers but I just don't get this movie.
3,This Disc Broke My DVD Player,"I've been a fan of the Coen brothers since ""Blood Simple"". They're always reinventing themselves and even if I don't care much for the result I'm always eager for their next offering. ""A Serious Man"" isn't one of their better films. Yes there are some inspired moments here but on the whole this is a case of style over substance. I was intrigued by the idea of them exploring the Midwestern American Jewish experience, which may have an element of autobiography for the Coens, but this exercise left me cold. The best you can say about the film is the performance of Michael Stuhlbarg as the harried physics professor. Stuhlbarg is a breath of fresh air and humanity in what is basically an antiseptic affair. Here's hoping the Coens get back on their game the next time."
1,the worst,"it was considerably more entrtaining,watching my freshly painted walls dry. And i cant think of 10 more words to describe how bad it was."
2,terrible,"I give it a 2 only because of a couple of interesting scenes and good camera work. Loved Fargo and Big Lebowski, liked other Coen Brothers movies. This is the first that I really didn't like. No plot and no real meaning, which would be ok if it were funny, but it wasn't."
2,Seinfeld without a punch line,"It's amazing to me how much hype this movie has gotten, as well as all the deep meaning people have managed to pull from it. I found it to be droll at best, and downright pretentious at its worst. Basically, just like the series Seinfeld, ""A Serious Man"" is about nothing. That's it - nothing. The only problem is that the movie even lacks a punch line, something that the series Seinfeld made sure to deliver. I'm sure that the Coen brothers are laughing to themselves at all of the profoundly Earth-shattering ""truths"" that people are falling all over themselves to extract from this pointless movie.You want a ""deep"" movie that explores the random and existential nature of life, and yet reveals what really lurks in the hearts of men and women? Get a copy of ""Leben der Anderen"" and watch it instead."
1,Terrible!,A real waste of time! You might like this if your Jewish but then again you might be more offended too!
1,"Odd, strange, wierd","I am sitting here watching this ""movie"" (if that is what you can call this debacle), if I were not so warm and cozy under my blankie, I would get up and turn it off. Maybe I will put something a little less painful on, maybe even Kevin Costners Waterworld.This movie is the pits. I hate movies without story lines. This is just s whole lot of jumbled pieces stuck together.My hats off to all the folks whom said this was a masterpiece. I wonder if they have ever seen a real movie?"
1,Irritating,Weak boned main character whose disastrous life deteriorates over the course of this odd film. Everything in this film is mediocre. Beginning and end of the film bear no relation to the story whatsoever.
2,All dressed up with nowhere to go,"There was no way anyone could keep me from seeing this film: Coen Bros, some schmoe loser in the 60's, average-Joe randomness... it had everything that entices me (no guns or car chases, no ""The Rock"" or Vin Diesel or jagoff Superheroes) but alas, I could't attach myself to anyone in it, and therefore couldn't find a pair of eyes through which to see or understand it. I wish they had gotten Charles Grodin, Matthew Broderick, Jason Alexander... SOMEone more real than who they used as the main character. He looked the part, but was too surreal.But that's just me. I agree with the ""Coen Bros missed the mark"" comments."
2,A Comedy for the Few,"I'm starting to think dark comedies are like inside jokes. Only people in the know are allowed in on what's funny. Also, a fan of the Coens, but unless you're Jewish and privy to the culture, you like myself won't get some of the humor here. More like a Dramedy, a study in characters where the humor is very subtle."
2,Never Takes Off,I was waiting for something to happen. It never did. Thought it might have some Jewish humor but I couldn't find it. I wouldn't recommend watching this. Only if you need a sedative to help induce sleep. Guess it's a great movie for insomniacs. Did have a good cast and the acting was good. It just never takes off the ground. Good sound track though. As a matter of fact the sound track is the only thing in this movie that's not grounded.
2,"SERIOUSLY MAN, total borefest!","Being quite fam w/physics, judaism, Hendrix, dentistry, divorce, ethnic ghost stories, how on GOD's good earth can one possibly dissect this pos for any minutia of reflective inspirational entertainment???? Several deus-ex-machina elements that transport viewer to meaningful rite of passage traditions but lackluster unemotional flatline dialogue. Perhaps the most interesting is the Great Escape to Canada scene and the F Troop replay. I am a patient woman and desperately seek the gem in most films, ack, coming up severely shorthanded here. The 5-star reviewers are to be commended for their adept fantasy writing skills.... friends and/or family of the Coens??? Consequently, quirky moments bottom line: Airplane and Hendrix licks, surprise outdoor tanning booth, kewl equation proof, Korean philosophy, and opening ghost story. BTW, in 1967 NO ONE hardly EVER used the F word,duh!!!!!!"
1,Worst Cohen Bros Movie ever,"WAY over rated!! I couldn't get past the music references which were about records released in 1970 and the movie was taking place in 1967. The whole opening was not referenced at all in the rest of the movie. Why was it there? The story about the teeth. WHY? There was no resolution or answer to anything. It was funny in a couple of spots, but beyond that-nothing. I LOVE all the other Cohen Bros films, but this was a bomb. What kind of ending was that? The whole thing was just a plain mess. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid!"
3,"Okay Film, But too complex for me","A Serious Man is a supposed dark comedy film written and directed by the Coen Brothers. I'll admit, it didn't interest me that much, I found it quite boring, mostly because I didn't understand the point behind it. I liked the main character Larry though, he was very sympathetic and oddly likable. This film apparently was too complex for me, and I rarely laughed, but overall it was okay. It seemed like it could have gone in many different directions but stayed on one narrow track. The ending scene was very ominous and almost frightening. 3 stars"
5,"good moisturizer, even with sensistive skin","I have very sensitive skin. In fact, I have had to return both of the Anthony Logistics Eye Gels because they caused my skin to react.This was recommended as a good alternative for me, given my sensitive skin. I have used the Eye Gel for several months now, and my skin has been moisturized with no adverse reaction.I would highly recommend this product for anyone with dry, sensitive skin."
5,Integration,"In this capstone book, Richard Gorsuch builds on decades of careful reflection on the process of integrating spirituality and psychology. It is permeated with hope and practical realism - hope because he believes theologians and psychologists can work together and practical because he thinks integration is more about working on problems together than it is about harmonizing their disciplines. He proposes that the disciplines of theology and psychology are radically different in their methodology and purposes setting the stage for complementarity rather than antagonism. Theologians, he suggests, do well to remain silent about the causes of phobias while scientific psychologists might be cautious about expounding on the meaning and purpose of life. When a discipline knows its limits, each can make a contribution to the greater common good. This is a book worth pondering."
3,Legendary?,"Nice to hav more early flatlanders material. No prob with recording, just find the saw sound more than annoying. Sounds like a theramin. Great other than that"
1,Recorded in a tin can,I know the technolgy was not that gereat in 1972 but the quality of the recording is simply dreadful!
4,does what it says,"i have fine hair with a little wave. i was looking for a moderately priced curl cream that did not have loads of preservatives/funky ingredients. i am very pleased with this product- and received a number of compliments on my hair when i used it. my only complaint is the size is quite small and i find i need to use a little more than they recommend to achieve desired results, so i may go thru the tube rather quickly."
4,Curly Q,This is one of the few products that actually define my frizzy curls. I'm impressed. Most of these products don't work for me.
1,Horrible and stiff,"I just got this yesterday so this morning I was so excited to try it. Oh my gosh...My hair feels horrible. I couldn't run my fingers through it at all. It pulled on my hair, made it crunchy. I had to put it up because I couldn't bear to feel it throughout the day. It feel almost as if there is glue in my hair, all over. There is no way to get a comb through this. I thought it was going to make my hair soft. No, this is not that product. I will be returning it as soon as I can."
3,Bill's never bad but........,"this really doesn't do him justice. Sound engineering is very marginal. The engineers had trouble with the French dials. Most solos popped up to the complete shock to the guy on the board. There are elements of a pick-up band here: Missed attacks and Harold Jones (drummer) who sounds like he's building a house most of the time. Far more superior results in this era can be found in the concerts in Sweden, BirdLand and Miami (Breakfast Dance and BQ). Still Basie is wonderful Basie."
3,Not too helpful for fine artists,"Though the author is clearly well informed about tax strategies, this book doesn't sufficiently address the needs of fine artists. The book seems to make the assumption that careers in the fine arts are straightforward. The book includes sections for specific disciplines, but those are not very in-depth. I did not get much more information from this book than I got from a general tax guide."
4,great old movie,purple Heart is a great movie from WWII. It characterized the American fighting spirit and what seperated us from our enemies at the time. A really great film from Holloy Wood.
5,A Different Look at Doolittle's Raiders,"This movie could be described as the flip side of ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,"" and it relates the stories of pilots and air crews actually captured by the Japanese. They were put on trial illegally by the Japanese, and since they refused to turn traitors to their country, they were executed. Thus this movie provides one of the more sobering aspects of World War II.Roy M. Raffield"
3,Purple Heart,Typical Wartime Propaganda Film based very loosely on the Dolittle Raid.Interesting to watch if you like these glossed over stories
2,Purple Heart.,"I was a little disapointed with this film unfortunately, as I was always a fan of Dana Andrews in my younger days.However this is one that I had never seen. I know there are many of his films, and I shall keep on trying to send for the ones that I do like.Sincerely Blanche Knowles."
1,Unrealistic and Unbelieveable Nonsense= A BAD Film,"This film is BAD. Whoever wrote the screenplay should have their SAG card taken away. AMC is dead-on right about this film, it's poorly made trash. The court room scenes are not believeable AT ALL. Just a poorly made film all the way around. I'm giving my copy to the thrift store ASAP."
1,High on the list of worst war movies ever made,"This is the worst war picture I have ever seen with the possible exception of ""Corregidor."""
4,An interesting political subplot as well,"What I have not seen mentioned in other reviews is the subplot involving the Japanese Army versus the Navy. The lead prosecutor is an Army officer. He is interested in showing Naval negligence in not adequately preventing the attack. He is convinced from his sources that the planes flew off the Hornet, but needs a direct confession. He even bugs the jail cell, which the men discover. As one of the men points out, if they came from Russian bases, this is political dynamite, and they will have to reinforce the frontier. If they came from China, the Army is at fault, and China will have to be completely overrun. If they came from the sea, the Navy is at fault, and more resources will have to be used to cordon off the home islands. The prosecutor tries one last gamble by offering a deal, which the men turn down, and he commits suicide to atone for his public failure. Even as a generalization based on actual events, this film has some post-war interest."
4,Sven takes us beyond one more time,"This album is a bit more in the club vein than Sven's previous outings. It seems a bit less dramatic than his last 2 to me, but Fusion is still a fantastic work by one of the undisputed masters of trance. You will not be dissapointed. I'm giving it 4 stars only based on the fact that I would give his last album 5."
5,Happy is as Happy does,"I got this half slip in white, size large. It looks just like the picture (there is a picture if you click the Title). It is long, but then the skirts I have are long. It fits nicely and lays well under the see-through skirts that I got it to wear with. I have not washed it, but it should do well as it is all cotton. Also, I bought cotton so there would be no issues with static cling. It has been so long that I had a skirt that was not lined that buying this seemed a chore. Would I get Nylon or cotton? Long or short? Should I get the one that could be cut to fit my length? Should I get 6 gores or 4? This is what I chose and I am happy with it. It fits and the material is nice. The elastic could be a bit sturdier, but I won't wear it often and elastic can be replaced. So, Happy is as Happy does."
2,A bit too New Agey for me,"Don't get me wrong - a lot of what the book says makes sense, but I found myself annoyed with the structure of the exercises the author presents in the book. I don't need to carry around words on notecards to understand what my life purpose is. I need to go out and live it."
4,VALDEMAR SERIES START,"I've been a Lackey fan for 20 years and the Valdemar series are her best work. You can't do better than the first of the books: Arrows of the Queen. If you love sentient horses, this is the series for you. However, the reader is uninspiring, which is why the rating I gave it is only 4 stars instead of the 5 stars it deserves. The woman reader is too old for the point of view of the 13 year old heroine, Talia. That aside, read or listen to this book then get the whole series - definitely worth it."
2,"Cute, sugary and predictable.","A very cute book. Talia is very cute, but poor and misunderstood by her family. Her magical horse person is cute and helps her, and from that point everything is just pink sugary happiness.I did not find a single plot twist in this book. The whole chain of events is very predictable.When someone's a bad guy, they're a bad guy for good, devillish, menacing, power-hungry and without any kind of thoughts, doubts or feelings. When someone's a good guy however, they will be nice to Talia, help her all the way, and have their own personality consisting of only good things. Then they'll have some minor emotional troubles but nothing Talia couldn't cure with her awesome power.Early teen girls who like horses, heartthrobs and happy endings, this is the book for you."
3,NOT BAD. FUN BUT AVERAGE,"ARROWS OF THE QUEEN continues the sage of the Heralds of Valdemar. The story may be a little overdone by now but ARROWS does an acceptable job of keeping it fresh and interesting. The characters are a little weak and there really isn't much plot but still it isn't bad for an afternoon read in the sun by the pool. It's difficult to guess where the next two in the series will take you since there is very little foreshadowing and, again, the plot is fairly weak. Will it get better? Who knows, I'll probably try the next one at least, just to see where it goes if for no other reason.Recommended? Yeah but don't expect too much."
5,The Best of the BEST!,"This was not the first Misty Lackey book I've read, but it's my hands-down favorite! I really connected with the main char, Talia, and it was easy to jump into the story. It's the kind of easy and fun read you eat up in one sitting. The plot moves along at a rapid pace. If you need a break from books that bog you down with all those nasty complications, this will be your vacation. And you'll be addicted, hopefully.For those of you looking for plots 100 leagues deep, this isn't the book for you, try read the Mage Winds trilogy instead. This is the first book ever written in the massive Valdemar series. There are a lot of open places to leave room for the future books. It is also the first book Lackey ever published, and you can tell. But for good, honest FUN and brilliant characters that promise more to come, this is an excellent book, trilogy, and series! And because the series is so massive, you can keep enjoying these brilliant characters!"
2,One of the WORST Valdemar books she has written,"Can't you see ""PERFECT LITTLE FAIRY TALE"" more clearly if it had been written on the cover in bold letters? Ok I admit not bad for a first book, but her other books are better. ok so it wasn't TOO bad but it was too cliched for my tastes. But I guess i read the book after all her other BETTER ones so it's not as good..."
3,Arrows of the Queen Review,"Well, unlike many other people, this was not the first Mercedes Lackey book that I read. I started with Magic's Pawn, and I believe that it is a much better book. For my tastes, this book was a little to light. It also had a startling resemliance to Anne McCaffery's Dragonriders of Pern. I enjoyed reading this book and I think that it would be great book for those begining to read fanticy. For those already into fanticy, don't be put off by the first book . . . they get progressively better as you go along. I have to say one thing in favor for this book, though. I was compleaty enthrolled when I read it."
2,Arrows of the Queen,"The young misfit Talia finds a home, a milk-white steed, and magical powers.This is uninspired YA fare, wish fulfillment at its lamest. Magical blue-eyed white horses; endless blather about self-esteem and ""caring""; a dull plot with massive holes (why can't a Queen fire her own daughter's dry-nurse?). The only hint of something better comes in the stories the kids learning to be Heralds tell about the dark fates of their elders, but that's not enough to carry the book. It's sentimental tripe.The idea of the Heralds is cool, except that we never see them do any Heralding in this book, and the Herald name is misleading because they don't do, well, heraldry, but it's an interesting concept that perhaps the author developed better in another text.Anne McCaffrey's Dragonsong trilogy is a far better written coming of age fantasy."
3,An early work from an excellent writer,"This is a good read, but not superior. There are too many cliches, a common sin of first-time fantasy writers. We've got magical white horses (at least they don't have wings), a Cinderella story, and a protagonist who's too good to be true. The world is one of the best I've come across, though, and the author continues to develop it in her other works. I'd recommend the book purely for that reason"
4,Easy Read,"It is more a set up for the world of Valdamar than anything but it is a comftorable easy read, if a bit simple, but it makes for a lovley Sunday afternoon."
4,great start,"This is a great start to the world of Valdemar, can't wait to delve deeper into the series. I've read some of her Bard books, in the past, a wonderful, vibrant series."
2,Meh,"I finally got around to reading this the other day. The writing isn't bad, and it held my interest to the end, but never once did I get the feeling that the heroine was actually 13 years old - she reads as if she's a very naive 16, then makes an abrupt leap to being about 20 in certain passages. Even worse, she doesn't act like a child who was raised in an abusive and patriarchal environment. Oh, we're *told*, more than once, that her guardedness is a problem and she'll need special help, but we're never *shown* it, nor is there much evidence that Talia's teachers and mentors are doing much about it, with once exception.I'm sure I would feel differently if I'd read this when I was a lonely teenager, but as an adult? *meh*"
3,A good first effort,"This isn't a great book.I was introduced to the Valdemar world by Darian in OwlSight. I decided then that I liked the writing and bought the gryphons trilogy, since it was chronologically first. Then I bought Honour's Valor. There I was hooked. I fell in love with Alberich (and felt extremely jealous of Myste). So after that I bought the three Arrows books and maaan..I was let down. They're not good books.On the other hand, though, I can completely understand why. To my knowledge, these are her first books. If they're anything like the stories I write, she had so much bottled up inside that she wanted to get out and just didn't have the experience to put it down well.I don't think there's any reason for people to get mean and say never buy her books. Indeed, if you like the world of Valdemar, these are a MUST READ BOOK. That said, if you're looking for a casual read, I'd pass up and pick something else."
4,This is an EXCELLENT BOOK!!!,When I was in high school I read this book and ever sence fell in love wit it I was so happy to see it out in print again at my local book store and of course I had to buy the whole series. If you like fantasy then this is a book to let yourself fall into.
2,Harry Potter in Valdemar!,"I finished this book today. The writing appears to aimed at the same age as the Harry Potter novels. You do not get a good graphical picture of any of the scenarios. Nor do any of the characters come across with strong personalities. Even Talia, who is the centre of the novel, has few personal traits.The storyline was bland and not very original.On the upside, it was easy to read and it has a nice cover."
5,LOOK NO MORE FOR A GREAT BOOK!,"If you love fantasy, you'll love this book. Talia dreams of becoming one of the heroic Heralds of Valdemar, and leaving the farm her family owns. Then, while fleeing from the thought of a forced marraige, she is rescued by a Companion, the horse-like mages that Heralds ride. Little did she now that when she got on the back of that white ""horse"" her life would change forever.Great book! I know my review stinks, but the series is a great read for young adults!"
3,A Good Place to Start,"In the first of the series, this book is a bit weak on character description and development. The plot keeps you turning the pages, though, and it is a valiant effort at a beginning."
4,The Saga Begins,"Mercedes Lackey's popular Heralds of Valdemar series starts with this simple story about an oppressed farm girl that runs away and lives her dream.simple words do not describe Mrs.Lackey's telling of this story, you must experience it for yourself, if you like High fantasy, without the main hero bieng a sterotype, get this book, you will love it."
3,Great for horse-crazy young people,"Not that great, in my opinion. Just not exciting. I like fantasy, but contrary to all the reviews that said ""Anyone who likes fantasy will love this book"", I didn't love this book. I prefer things a little...deeper, more involving. Like Sabriel and The Golden Compass. It also seemed too long; although it wasn't very long, really, I guess I just wanted it to end. It wasn't terrible, but it's far from the best fantasy I've ever read. And Arrow's Flight wasn't much better than this. Trying to think of something positive to say now, to be fair. I love the cover art. This book is probably best for girls age 13-18 who like not-too-serious fantasy with magic and strong (but not unrealistically strong) female characters, and especially for those who like horses. If you like horses and fantasy this is YOUR BOOK."
2,Audio Book Disappointment,"I give the original book a 5 star rating, this audio book however was a major disappointment. On average I listen to 10-15 hours worth of audio books per week and was really excited to see one of my favorite books finally available in audio format. What a major let down it turned out to be. A good audio book is performed, Carol Edie Smith mostly just reads this book. While she has very good diction (used to stage performances perhaps?) her reading of this book is almost a distraction - odd pauses and stressess on the weak portions of the text at the expense of the really significant moments really detract from Mercedes Lackey's prose. Ms. Smith is only capable of either speaking in her own voice or her voice with a Irish accent. At times it was difficult to know which character was speaking due to her inability to differentiate voices. Don't buy this , read the book instead....."
2,A Fair Start,"FANTASY TRILOGY-A fantasy story stretched into 3 books. (See JRR Tolkien.) JRR Tolkien-Creator of the definitive FANTASY TRILOGY, often imitated, never duplicated. That being said this is the first book of a FANTASY TRILOGY, so we know that it is of epic proportions. It doesn't leave me eager for more, it leaves me hoping for better in pts. 2 & 3. We have the standard guilds: Bards, Healers and Rangers-(oops, that's Tolkien, sorry). In this trilogy they're Heralds. The standard apprentice (of course, an outsider among her own people, but golly gosh, so misunderstood and golly gosh, she's capable of great power, why she may even be the most powerful among her guild) , the standard animal companion. I've read other of Ms Lackey's books and she is capable of much better. I'll continue on into the rest of the trilogy and hope it reaches the heights of the Gryphon series."
2,Decent Brain Popcorn,"Usually it's negative messages that get sledgehammered into people, not positive ones -- never have I been hit over the head so hard with the idea that ""It's OK!"" *wham* ""to be gay!"" *wham*. Of course, this is a first novel, and as such, it's actually pretty decent -- it's no ""Lord of the Rings"" by any stretch of the imagination, and I'll probably never re-read it, but for an afternoon's dalliance it was certainly acceptable. And there's no doubt that it's chock-full of positive role-models (wham!) for young women."
4,Story good; character TOO TOO perfect,"This is the first Mercedes Lackey novel I've read, and I really look forward to reading more of them, especially about the Heralds of Valdemar. My only problem with the book was Talia's talents. What next for the girl? Can she cure the common cold too? Every chapter was a new expansion on her inherent skills. It got a little ... predictable at the end. I would like to see the nature of the Companions explored in greater depth. I do agree with other readers that it is definitely an adolescent girl's fantasy come true - which is not a bad thing by any means"
5,The best book I've ever read.,"This is the first book by her that I have read. Now I have read all of the Valdemar books, from THE BLACK GRYPHON to OWLFLIGHT. This is the best book I have ever read, and I have read a lot, varying from THE BOXCAR CHILDREN series, to STAR WARS YOUNG JEDI KNIGHTS series, to fantasy, to DESIRE to LES MISERABE. I liked this trilogy best. If you like reading fantasy/science fiction, you should definently read this."
4,A gate opening to a wonderous realm..,"Where I started so many years ago.. Not one of Ms. Lackey's better works, but the building block for all the other stories set in the realms of Vandlemar and those around it. Her first few books show her fedging feathers in the writing realm, but from there she starts to fly.While the story is a little pat, a little too cliche, every once in a while it's nice to be fully wrapped in happy escape fiction to a world of black and white that in later novels becomes covered in grey. Read between the lines, a very good case study of physical and mental abuse."
4,Couldn't connect with the main character...,"While this was the first book that I read by Mercedes Lackey,(and the one that hooked me on others) I must admit when I read her other works (most especially By The Sword) it wasn't up to par. Plot was great- the problem I had with it was I couldn't feel much passion for Talia. She was an amazing person, but kind of- bland. No temper to control, etc. etc. She didn't have any major faults that she had to conquer inside herself. I'm not asking for some mean streak, but some kind of weakness we all can relate too. Don't tell me she was shy to a fault- she was an important person at the Queen's court and many times spoke for what she beleived in. It was just hard to connect with her. (I find Kerowyn and Elspeth much more interesting characters.) But, again, on the whole, a very good read."
5,She got to me again!!!,"I just love this author. She has the ability to put you in the story along with the main characters. I cared what happened to Talia and crew, and I just can't wait for more books in this particular vein."
2,Don't get me wrong; I enjoyed reading it.,"I realized the other day that everything about Valdemar makes perfect sense if you assume that Mercedes Lackey came up with the world when she was 13 years old. Her heroines are ALWAYS misunderstood adolescents from Oklaho--excuse me, the Boondocks, until a wonderful white horse comes and CHOOSES them because, despite the fact that no one around them ever realized this, they're really special and wonderful. And then they get trained to do great, heroic deeds.It's the perfect adolescent fantasy.Don't get me wrong; I actually quite enjoy her books. However, if you're looking for fantasy with a complex society or characters who aren't universally pure of heart, word, and deed, I would suggest Katherine Kurtz or Steven R. Donaldson. If, however, if you're looking for something to read while recovering from the flu, Mercedes Lackey is just about perfect"
3,utopian societies are boring,"Don't get me wrong, I like a lot of Lackey's books, but this is quite obviously an early attempt. The characters are pretty flat and fall under two categories: 1) perfectly humble and ethical shining warriors of light, or 2) power hungry evil monsters in human form. Talia is far too capable a person to nurse any kind of sympathy out of the reader past page 80 or so. I did like Lackey's explination of mind-magic and the imagery to go with it. The herald-companion link is perhaps TOO reminiscent of the dragonriders of pern series. Overall a nice entertaining read, but I prefer the Vanyel or Tarma and Kethry stories."
2,RAISE HELL'S DISAPPOINTING DEBUT 2.5/5 RATING,"Raise Hell is not a bad band at all,they just seem to get boring fast. I bought this CD and had it for 2 weeks without playing it so much I got tired of it,but everytime I put the CD in the song (Black Visions) track 7 I think,is the only song that really had any substance to me. The other songs get boring and repetitive if you want good Death Metal from Sweden check(ARCH ENEMY,IN FLAMES/WHORACLE,OR DISSECTION WHICH IS WHO RAISE HELL TRIES TO CLONE.ALSO BY ALL MEANS AVOID THERE OTHER TWOS RELEASES(NOT DEAD YET,WICKED IS MY GAME) LIKE THE PLAGUE,RAISE HELL MAY BE THE SECOND BIGGEST SELL OUT SINCE METALLICA,JUST LISTEN TO NOT DEAD YET,IT SOUNDS LIKE MEGADETH OR MANOWAR,GIVE ME A BREAK!"
2,violet guide review,"I was quite disappointed in this book. I was looking for a basic how to guide in the care of violets. It was to scientific in nature, and not basic in the information needed. I would not recommend it for novice violet growers such as myself."
1,Good....if you're a Huge Audio Adrenaline fan.....,"I've heard Audio Adrenaline before and haven't been a huge fan, but I totally fell in love with their song ""Pierced"" that I heard on the radio. Not really having a strong feeling about it, I bought it and hoped that I would like the other songs- Huge mistake. While there were a few songs I liked, the rest seemed a bit too much. Many of the lyrics and background music reflect the band's original musical style on their first few cds. I personally, didn't like their first few cds. In conclusion, I would only buy this cd if you have extra cash to burn or if you really like this band. If you're just beginning your Christian music collection, keep shopping! Find a bansd with stronger music and with way better songs."
5,Easily my favorite Audio A. album,"This is one album that is best listened to as a whole; every song builds on the last and complements it so well. Of the 2 ""Worldwide"" tracks, I prefer ""Two,"" but the song that made my jaw hit the ground was ""Miracle."" This is a simply beautiful song regarding the miracle of losing your prominence in this life and realizing that it's actually better that way. Very poignant song; a must-hear for anyone needing encouragement in their faith. ""Church Punks"" is another great one, asking Christian youth to stand up and be counted as one of His. Similarly, ""Dirty"" invites us to live our faith and not be afraid of getting dirty for Christ. I could go on like this for every song, but you get the idea. This album is very lyrically intricate and just fun to listen to, like all Audio A. albums. You can't get much better than this!"
3,Likeable but schizo,"Audio A is a great band and Worldwide is no exception. My main problem with it is that it's a ""Pop sandwich."" With the exception of the languishing ""Ocean Floor"" retread at the end, It's composed of a couple rock songs at the beginning, a couple at the end, and an unbearably long space of slowish pop songs in-between. I prefer a tossed ""rock salad"" to a ""pop sandwich"" anyday. Mix it up a bit next time, OK? And throw in a few croutons.Final gripe: This CD is too short. Tacking on a radio remix of an old song may make it seem longer, but really, all we get is about 35 minutes of new material.There was room for a couple more rock songs (and a need for them), but alas, the band went home too early. Maybe next time."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I have the opportunity to listen to music before it is released to the general public. I work for a music company and get free demos and pre-releases and all that good stuff. I have been a long time fan of Audio A, but after hearing this CD I was greatly disappointed. This CD's songs sound too much like all their other stuff. In my opinion, Audio A is running out of ideas... I think it might be time to find a new band. Try Switchfoot, Mercy Me or Relient K."
4,A+,"I recently heard about Audio Adrenaline, and heard some of their songs online.. This Cd is pretty good. All the songs are great!"
5,Worth it,this cd is worth more than they charge. this is possibly the best cd i own out of over 50 cds.
4,A wonderful collection of off kilter pop!,"The Tall Dwarfs are in Tall form for this newest release. Coming on the heels of the slightly dissapointing ""Stumpy,"" this is a welcome album that shows the boys in high form, blending the sounds of Wevill and some of the older albums. Of course, it's trite to compare it to older albums, as this stands clearly on it's own. Having heard Alec Bathgates solo release, I can sense that he had a stronger hand in creating some of these tunes, but Knox still dominates with his great vocal range. A worth while album for fans and newcomers alike. There are a wide variety of songs, from catchy pop tunes to bluesy melodies to low-fi adventures. Snatch it up!"
5,Now this is what I call the perfect book for siblings!,My 8 year old son loves reading me stories written by other siblings. Each story describes how challenging and rewarding it is to have a sibling with special needs. Thanks to all the wonderful kids who wrote in. My son is going to write his own story just for our family!I would recommend this book highly!Edie
1,Worst Software I Have Ever Purchased!!,"I have installed many, many software programs over the years and I have never had as much trouble with a ""professional"" product. Most, if not all, of the computer protection software I have seen is overpriced, but at least the other brands actually work. With this Internet Security Suite I couldn't even get it to install properly. The Anti-Virus portion of the package would not install without an internet connection (Note: It told me this as I was looking at the eTrust technical support website). It also told me that my settings were not correct. However, it didn't say which settings were incorrect or how I might change them. The tech support website was no help and they charge $50 for calling to talk to a person. And, of course, you cannot return opened software except for the same thing. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
2,SOTW goes electric,"This was the first SOTW album to go ""electric"" and it suffers as a result. They haven't found their feet here yet. The record is not as good as recent efforts and the songwriting is weaker than earlier works. The best track on here is an amazing electric re-working of ""Political"" from Labour Day. The rest are pretty forgettable."
4,Shopping Tycoon Lovers,Mall Tycoon 2 has new environments to choose from-and-you can build 9 Shopping levels! It has the same look and feel as Mall Tycoon 2. I was hoping on more of a 3D environment like the Sims 2--they're not there yet-and I hope it wont be too long. This is the BEST shopping mall tycoon you can buy!
1,This game sucks.,"No explanations, and good luck figuring it out on your own. What you do is build rooms, select stores to put in them. You have more stores you can unlock but it doesn't tell you how to do that so you're screwed...I bought this at my school book fair for 14.95 and it's the biggest ripoff ever.It's a piece of crap. The only thing the CD is good for would be a hockey puck, if even that.This gets negative stars."
4,Crowmatix make their voice's heard!,"This CD is superb for those who like the blues with a touch of country rock. Levon Helms voice is in fine form on the tracks he sings on and true to his past work, his instrumentals are great as well. Marie Spinosa really displays her tremendous vocal ability in the song ""poor little fool"". Rick Danko's well written Java Blues is a tremendous contribution. There are some other well written songs as well, the ballad ""The great Beyond"" is a perfect example of the great songwrting. This album is loaded with guest musicians that are legends in the rock and roll industry such as Garth Hudson and Tom ""Bones"" Malone (from the Blues Brothers and Letterman's band). I would highly recomend this to blues fans and diehard fans of the Legendary ""Band"" and their members. Hopefully there will future releases from the Crowmatix."
5,Levon Helm and the Crowmatix - Souvenir Volume 1,"This is an excellent album, an earthy fusion of different genres of music - blues, country, soul, roots and cajun. The band is tight and the vocals are strong and honest. I cant wait to hear Volume Two. Well done Mr Helm!"
3,Polly Fell Apart,Polly fell apart in my 5 year old's hands. She had only played with her about 3 times. I was watching her play with it and then it just fell apart at the waist. The hips broke in two and the legs fell right out. Not a toy for a little one as not only do the outfits and accessories pose a severe choking risk the doll obviously does also.
5,Very Nice.,"I'm glad they included girls from other countries in this set.The movie was good, but does Polly have to be THAT popular?My friend and I cracked up when the helicarpter went into the air. IT WAS HILARIOUS!"
5,Groundbreaking CD For Historic Instrument!,"This album is an unparalleled display of the historic Hungarian folk instrument, the Tarogato! Listening to this instrument is an experience that is not to be missed. Esther Lamneck is outstanding as she takes the Tarogato far beyond what its ancient craftsman could have possible imagined. The juxtaposition of Hungarian folk music with cutting-edge electronic composition is delicious. On this disc, Esther Lamneck brings to life the work of some of the world's leading composers, including her own innovative piece, titled Settings. If you feel as strongly about this album as I do, do yourself the favor of locating Dr. Lamneck's clarinet work on her Diverse Settings album which came out on the Capstone label in 1998."
4,Center of the sun by Conjure one,"This was my first purchase on Amazon, and I really have to say that i probably will shop there again. Fast service, and they even added a written comment to a tiny scratch in the casing. This is the kind of service we all like. The scratch isn't so important when they offer an apology with the product...."
3,"a pleasant experience, mostly...","Eh, not bad. One of those semi-pleasant experiences you watch and feel mildly moved by, especially the ""what are they gonna do"" ending. I was more interested in the characters than what they were talking about, so I was disappointed when they ranted on about environmentalism and psychology and other boring things. It's sort of like ""preaching-within-screenwriting,"" and I know the actors wrote part of the screenplay themselves. I could easily imagine them sitting at their computers typing up their rants as if writing out a sermon. But the movie does improve when they talk about themselves, about their thoughts and feelings, about their lives. The acting is good, the scenery is nice, the movie itself is relaxing and ethereal at times. Not a bad experience, and I liked the characters enough to wonder what they'll do next. So hopefully they'll make another movie in another five to ten years. Hell, I hope they keep these characters around till their old age."
2,"Walk me up when it's over, will you?","I didn't care for the first one and could barely stand this one. I like movies with some excitement and fantasy in them. Where is the entertainment in this movie? If I want to see two people blabbing on and on, I could like see them in this movie. Maybe that's the point of this stupid movie. Sorry, I take the ""stupid"" part back. It's just a dumb movie. I am sure it works for people who might have failed in relationships, people who are lonely, or people can't communicate. The world is full of folks who actually find meanings in a movie -- any movie -- even this one."
1,"starts slow, gets slow, got slower... and stopped","actually wrote the review for the soundtrack by mistake, disliked the movie so much that i am re-writing it here for dvd. do you like walking and talking and trying to fake a conversation...? i don't and i really don't want to watch two other people who are faking that activity and faking it badly. this one is a t-u-r-d, turd. you get to see paris since they only go for a walk, you wish theyed just jump one another so you could start wathcing the other movie you rented before you completely waste saturday night. if i am wrong, let me know, maybe i will re-watch it, then again like i said in the first review of the soundtack, i'd rather jump in lake michigan in november."
1,Paper dolls,"I'm crazy about Richard Linklater's films except for this miniseries.Here are two people stumbling into a reunion after a one-night stand nine or ten years earlier. It's Paris. He's a writer; she works for an environmental organization. Will they? Won't they?Sounds great! Sounds romantic! Unfortunately these are two paper-thin, self-absorbed characters. They just don't matter very much. The Paris they wander through is the Paris of paper postcards. It won't, I promise, matter a whole lot whether they wind up together at the end except maybe they deserve each other!High point: a few seconds of Nina Simone singing ""Just in Time"" as the credits come up."
3,"Ethan Hawke's and Julie Delpy's mottled, yellow teeth","I was prepared to give this nice movie 5 stars...until I saw the 10 minute ""making of"" feature on the dvd. I got sick to my stomach when I saw that our two beautiful actors apparently don't have time enough in their lives to visit the dentist. No wonder they didn't kiss each other! Other than that, this is a wonderful film. I hope they make another one!"
1,Yawn...,"I did not like Before Sunrise and basically got this movie to see scenes of Paris. Unfortunately, the two boring talking heads of the main characters kept getting in the way. There are many tedious scenes of them just sitting and blabbering on and on. I don't know how anyone can find this sweet and romantic. I set the DVD to french to minimize the pain, but it was still unbearable to see constant close-ups of their yellowing teeth which were constantly visible with them talking about their terribly boring lives.And Ethan Hawke! Are you kidding, with that shirt? Who would fall in love with a guy wearing a bowling shirt? He also needs to shave.Next time I want to see Paris, I'll simply fly there. The 7-hour plane ride was a lot less boring than this movie."
4,Before Sunset,"I enjoyed this laid back, walk through Paris, movie. It would not have been quite so meaningful if I had not seen ""Before Sunrise"" first. That should be a must for all viewers. It gives ""Before Sunset"" the needed depth."
1,"All talk, no action.","Maybe I missed the point, but all the story consisted of was two strangers meet on a train, get off the train and spend time together and talk, talk, talk; agree to meet in the same city at a future date, get back on separate trains and go their separate ways. Not much of a story here."
4,Excellent Sequel,"Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy work magic on screen.The two movies are meshed together very well. It's interesting to see how the old lovers have changed yet are still the same, and how their chance meeting 9 years earlier in Vienna impacted their lives .In my opinion Before Sunrise is still the better of the two movies , but Before Sunset stirs up many of the same memories, and emotions . The outcome is once again left up to you...would you make the same mistake twice....Rent or buy both movies you wont regret it"
3,"A good movie ( for the most part), except----","Except for the fact the script writer found it relevant to incorporate liberal philosophy and agenda into an otherwise decent movie. When the two were discussing politics and essentially "" dumping "" on the U.S. you felt as if you were watching a political add on tv. This was distractng and quite annoying to my sensiblities because it didn't need to be there. Sadly, many directors take upon the occassion to incorporate their political agenda via the script as if the audience is too dumb or indifferent to take notice of such an obvious short-coming. As a resuly i immediately felt alienated from the movie and despite my best efforts to focus on this love between the two I was side tracked with politics. I needed to deduct three stars from an otherwise 5 star movie. In the future i should hope the script writer and director appreciate the fact that good movies don't need to feel like a commercial, albeit 80 minutes at that."
4,o,I did not see the first movie but this one is good and you can watch them out of order. The acting was superb and the plot was realistic. The only reason why I gave it four stars is because Ethan looks terrible than he did nine years ago. What happened? Must be drugs or something.
1,Yawn...,"Like ""Gerry"" a walking, talking go-no-where movie. Sorry, but I found NO redeeming qualities in it, just boredom and blathering."
1,possibly the most boring film ever made,"I vaguely remember the first movie titled ""Before Sunrise"" and enjoyed it for what it was-a brief encounter of 2 strangers in an interesting environment with lots to see. However, this sequel should never have been made. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy reunite for another brief encounter, but it is more of the same without all the great scenery. Now they are older and more cynical and talk about the most insipid things. Julie is now a bitter, left-wing enviro-kook that whines about all her boyfriends not marrying her. Ethan stares at her with puppy dog eyes and a goofy grin and just vacuosly agrees with her anti-American rhetoric just hoping to get laid. The ending left me with a feeling of dread that they might make a third. If so, I know I won't be seeing it. Avoid this one at all costs."
5,The Most Beautiful Film I Have Ever Seen,"""Before Sunset"" is the most beautiful movie I have ever watched. I love every second of it and wished that it would go on forever. It's really just about two people talking and talking and talking and you can never believe how powerful talking really can be. Or when two people connect with each other. Even though separated by an ocean and not meeting for nearly a decade. This movie awakened me to the lyricism of life and made me feel a lot more human after each viewing. Highly recommended!"
5,Before Sunset,"Loved this one from beginning to end! Also, to truly get the full effect, you must also see Before Sunrise. Great Acting, Great Story!!!"
3,Not a bad sequel,"There's a lot of talking in this movie, FYI. It's essentially the two characters having a conversation throughout the movie, so if that's not your thing, then you won't like this movie. Overall, I thought it was cute."
2,Good ending,"Rather than an immediate sequel ( Rocky II, Rocky III,et al ), Before Sunset simmered for nine years, allowingthe director, Ethan Hawke, and Julie Delpy to ageand grow and calcify. I didn't care for Before Sunrise,principally because I flinch at Ethan Hawke's acting,and because it was a dialogue movie without muchmagic in the dialogue.Before Sunset is another dialogue movie --- but thedialogue is absent any particular clarity or distinction,unless your standard is TV situation comedies. Thereis no significant reach in verbal expression or poetry.I would rather listen to and look at Nick and Nora Charlesnine years later - or Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory( My Diner With Andre ) than these two.The chemistry seems contrived and the ongoing referencesto sexual activities removes the sensuality from therelationship. It does end quite well - fading out withoutany momentous denoument - or declaration that we willhave these two to look forward to again somewheredown the road."
2,small and charming,"This is a very minor movie, but it benefits from its Parisian setting and will resonate with anyone who has met up after a long time with someone who was important to them and finds the conversation flowing as if their relationship had continued during that time. The makers wisely confine the movie to 80 minutes, any more would have been overblown. There simply isn't enough here to last any longer. I find it hard to understand the 5 star awards that some amazonies have bestowed on this movie. I can only conclude that they identify so strongly with one of the main characters or with their situation that they simply fail to see the movie's limitations."
1,IT SUCKS,It flat out sucks and is boring as hell. Just 80 minutes of blah blah which we just fast forwarded through.
2,Doesn't match Before Sunrise,"Wow. How could the director of Before Sunrise create such a wasteful movie. I truly looked forward to this second installment from the moment I heard about it. I found myself being put-off by the political statements that he felt his characters needed to make, instead of focusing on their lost friendship.I was also bothered by Ethan Hawkes new found southern accent which was no place to be found in the original.So much could have been done with this film. So little was."
2,So boring,"This movie is just talking and talking.There's nothing interesting at all, very slow. If you're bored in the middle don't try to finish the movies it gets even slower"
2,What if you had another chance with the one that got away?,"What if? Well we'll never know. I anxiously awaited the sequel. But I was so disappointed. Before Sunset has an unnatural cut-off ending.The main characters have so much chemistry together, but the viewer is utterly cheated out of so much has Jesse's hand in Celine's hair, or even a kiss. Not one kiss. Oh brother. Superb acting, superb setting, sublime love story... horrible horrible cliffhanger ending. And not even a kiss or love scene. At least in Before Sunrise we had the scene in the park to hang onto.The acting was better, Jesse was more likeable, Celine a bit less annoying and cloying, but overall the ending ruined the movie leaving it just as up in the air as the first."
1,"Uninteresting, uncouth and inarticulate","The opening 30 minutes of this film lost me entirely. Having to listen to a long sophomoric dialogue between this singularly uninteresting, inarticulate and really quite uncouth couple was for me intolerable. Ethan Hawke's character is the sort of fellow I dread to have sitting next to me in a restaurant or on a long plane ride - so full of himself and yet so deeply empty! The threat of these two as probable lovers in the remainder of the movie was more than I could take - I freely admit that I switched it off, enough was enough."
4,Hold's the same magic 10 years later,"I was a HUGE ""Before Sunrise"" fan since the movie came out and so I really didn't want to see this because I was worried that it was going to ruin the ambiance of the 'series', but being a true fan I watched & loved it! It picks up where you would expect they left off. Also I was watching the documentary and Ethan Hawke said that himself, Delpy & Linklater is going to try to make another sequel in another 10 years and I sincerly hope they do!"
5,my favorite movie of all time!,"""I believe if there's any kind of God it wouldn't be in any of us, not you or me but just this little space in between"", well maybe some of you already have heard that (is a quote in Before Sunrise), well I think that is that quote is true, this movie is the closest I ever saw to get, to describe, that space that exist between two people. Very recommended!!"
5,Straight-forward advice,"Studer offers solid, straight forward advice for healthcare leaders at all levels. Whether you are a CEO, manager or shift supervisor, you will find pearls of wisdom that will help you to stay the course on your quest to achieving service excellence. The simple, Q&A approach makes this book a quick read. Studer addresses some of the most common challenges managers face when trying to make a culture change."
4,".Wrong eye drops, but okay.","The eye drops that were shipped were substituted for the ones I ordered, but they seem okay.My concern is that such substitutions will be made in the future without my prior approval, and they may not be what I really want."
5,The Most Underrated Supreme Court Justice in History,"Tinsley Yarbrough does a great justice to Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan with this work.Often overlooked and neglected, the second Harlan was actually more accomplished than the first, and may very well be the most astute and distinguished dissenter in the history of the Supreme Court. A man of amazing scholarly achievement and disciplined intellectuality, Harlan was actually a more well rounded and principled judicial figure than many of the more popular activist justices during his time of service.I am very surprised that this is the first review of this book. Mr. Yarbrough put together a wonderful and sober minded biography of a brilliant figure deserving of a lot more attention than he's been afforded. I highly recommend this work to anyone interested in the Supreme Court and one of the better justices ever to occupy the bench."
4,Interesting Film from Hospice Volunteers,"Interesting compilation of the experiences of hospice workers who come from all faiths (or lack thereof) and walks of life. Perhaps the pacing is a bit slow, though this may be intentional. This is not about what happens after death, or the mechanics of death. Instead it is an insight to the culture of dying in the United States and the end of life process for those in hospice. Thought provoking, unique and well rounded this film is a great addition to end-of-life documentaries."
2,Missed the mark.,"Hospice is amazing and provides a much needed service to those who need it. My comment is not about the organization but about this documentary. It could and should have been written and produced so much better. The interviews with the volunteers fell short, mostly, of giving the viewer a more comprehensive view of what happens entirely with being a Hospice volunteer. There was one good interview with a former volunteer who became a person in the end stage of life. She offered some ""lessons for the living,"" but this is where the title falls short. Not too many lessons to hear about, nor was there a good understanding about how to be a volunteer and what precisely one does. Save your money buying this video, just donate directly to the organization."
3,Take it for what it is...,"I suppose that if you have every other Donna Summer hits collection -- like some of the other reviewers here -- then this collection seems pointless. However, if you're like me and don't have anything else by this artist, the collection -- though yes, not totally inclusive -- is fine. It's been a long time since I've heard ""Last Dance,"" ""Hot Stuff"" and probably my favorite, ""On The Radio"". I remember listening to these songs in my pre-teen years, and this collection is cheaper than most of its type. So, if you want some of the essential hits, this should whet your appetite."
3,Skimpy Collection,"Although this compilation contains some of Donna Summer's greatest hits, it does not compare well with other collections like the Donna Summer Anthology with 34 tracks or Endless Summer with 18 tracks or On The Radio with 16 tracks.Having said that, this Millennium Collection does have her biggest chart hits from the early sensual track Love To Love You Baby, through the electro-disco trance masterpiece I Feel Love, her majestic version of MacArthur Park, her rock-disco hits from 1979 Hot Stuff and Bad Girls, the duet with Streisand and later stuff from the 1980s like Love Is In Control and She Works Hard For The Money.It showcases her early work with Giorgio Moroder and the later pop direction and includes both sizzling dance tracks and a ballad or two. For a more complete look at this amazing singer, I recommend one of the aforementioned compilations or her classic album Bad Girls which is a timeless masterpiece."
1,Don't Blame Donna!!!,"Donna Summer herself can hardly be blamed for yet another greatest hits compilation - this is entirely down to the record company who owns her back catalogue. If there was anything she could do to stop it, I am sure she would. Like every other hard-core fan, I am waiting patiently for the new album. I wouldn't splash out for this and I bet Donna wouldn't either. Save your money and buy Josiah Howard's Donna Summer biography instead!!!"
4,Let's be fair,"It is true that this is Summer's umpteenth Compiliation CD,however, to some how blame her for the releases, is crazy.Major labels milks profitable catalogs every day.The songs are a solid collection of Donna hits.There is nothing new in the package, but its a good primer to her past hits. With a new CD coming out later this year, I think it's a good reminder why she has so many passionate fans.The last greatest hits, I bought was ""Endless Summer"".The Anthology and Endless Summer CD's are the ones to buy if you want Classic Summer. This package could have been made interesting if Universal included her more ""Underground"" ... smashes, like ""Try Me I know We Can Make"" or ""Summer Fever"".BTW, the new Donna Summer song ""Beautiful"" is super hot, heard it last night:)I want more of that! As a CD, this one has the commercial hits,not very interesting, but I am sure the newbies to Summer, can get with it."
4,The Essentials at a Great Price,"I have been a frequent critic of the great 20th Century Masters rip-off foisted on the record-buying public, but here's what I liked about this set. One, I paid less than ten bucks for this collection. Two, it had all the Casablanca/Mercury hits I was looking for with the exception of ""Heaven Knows,"" (a sacrifice I was willing to make at the expense of being a tightwad). The only other Top 10 singles missing are 1980's ""The Wanderer"" on Geffen and 1989's ""This Time I know It's for Real"" on Atlantic. I already had ON THE RADIO on vinyl, but wanted an economic upgrade to CD that didn't have all the cross-fades between songs. So for someone like me that enjoys disco as a guilty pleasure, this was a satisfying fix. RECOMMENDED"
3,Great music for an exercise routine,"I danced to disco in the day, but I didn't listen to the lyrics. That's my story and for the most part I'm sticking to it. Well, really the purpose of dance music is to get you up and moving. That's what I bought this CD for---workout routine music.But in Donna Summer's case there is some good content in there, too. ""She works Hard for the Money"" and ""MacArthur Park"" are two notable songs. Also, her duet ""Enough is Enough"" with Barbra Streisand is a real standout."
2,A six month solution,"We bought this for Karaoke last July. We've used it maybe a half dozen times since then, but when we went to use it today (less than 6 months since we bought it) the CD drawer would not open. I hope J&R; Music World (who we bought it from through Amazon.com) allows me to exchange it!The karaoke was ok. The microphone sound is not very clear since it's being synthesized through the player, and the lyrics are sometime jumbled, but for the money it was an ok karaoke machine. Now I wish I'd spent a little more, though, because six months is not enough for anything to last!!!"
3,COBY DVD Player with Karaoke DVD628,"It is not a top of the line product, but enough for amature young children to have fun with. Unforturnately, the microphone that came with the package did not work. I checked out the warrenty on Koby's website and found out that it would cost me more than the microphone's worth to get a replacement. So I did nothing."
2,Don't waste your time.,"Save your time and don't buy this item. I bought this from Comp-U-Plus last Monday and the lyrics for the karaoke did show up on the screen at all. I am glad that I opened up and used it before Christmas. Unless your know every song by heart, don't buy. Everything else worked with it, like the dvd, cd, and mp-3. That's why I gave it 2 stars. I guess I will be losing twice my money on shipping. Happy Holidays!"
3,Crappy Remote Control,"I choose this brand because of the size and the fact that it plays DVD and CDG media- keeping that in mind, this device is only good for what I needed it to do. When you insert a DVD, it takes a bit of time for the player to process and take you to the main menu. It is super slow. Also, don't count on the remote control to save you from having to get up off the couch. I've replaced the batteries, cleaned the receiver, and I am still lucky if the player responds to a 'pause' command from 2 inches away. You get what you pay for and this Coby DVD player dressed in proof."
4,COBY DVD Player with Karaoke DVD628,The product working good...and the price cheep...good for first own DVD player.
2,Could be better,"The pictures in this book are good, all black and white though (Except the front and back cover), It does give a good detail of the waterfall- that's about the only thing saving it from a even lower rating.The directions are ok, but the writer could have vastly improved the quality of the directions with maps of each falls, like what Mr.Plumb did in his book Waterfall Lovers Guide pacific Northwest.The writer of this book IMO did a better job on his Yellowstone book."
3,"Agreed, could have been better.","I was disappointed to find of the ""roadside"" waterfalls, most of them were merely visible from the road. And by visible, he meant if you looked way off in the distance. The two northern most falls are around 4 miles away from the closest roadside view. Still, it was nice to have a guide to find them. GPS coordinates would have been nice, both for the falls themselves, and for the suggested viewing locations."
5,Just as described,"WOW! WHAT A DEAL! By far the best price: so low I didn't think it could be a genuine Bosch, but it WAS!"
4,Great DVD but no follow through with rest of season,"I would have given five stars but they, again, didn't complete the series, like every series that came to DVD."
2,Caveats to this Drill,"Don't get me wrong - the drill is GREAT. The problem is the battery - if you don't use them on a regular basis, they lose their charge - forever. Milwaukee has a manual on how to ""jump start"" dead batteries, but it's a half-baked solution. The truth is, NiCad batteries from Milawaukee are seriously flawed for the occasional user. Probably great for a tradesman.I have a similar Porter Cable drill - the drill itself is junk compared to the Milwaukee. But, the batteries have lasted forever. Not sure what the difference is, but buyer beware. I'd suggest going to the Lithium Ion models."
1,Electrical Contractor,"I have 4 Milwaukee drills, 14.4v and 2 18v sawzalls...Milwaukee has certainly cheapened up their tools...batteries last about 3 months then start to deteriorate and finally die after about 8 months...I switched to Panasonic 15.6 tools...batteries stay charged longer, tools are more powerful and lighter...cost is comperable...Milwaukee has had a battery problem for years...they do have a fix by draining the battery completely but it does not work..."
1,Bad batteries...........,Milwaukee NiCads have a well earned rep for being JUNK!!!! The tools are great but Milwaukee NiCads SUCK!!!!!!!!! Buy DeWalt or Makita or Lith Ion if its Milwaukee u have to have
5,Excellent Worship CD,Delirious does an excellent job with this CD. Lord You Have My Heart is my favorite. Great worship CD
5,What a collection!,"Not since The Cutting Edge has there been such a well-thought out and as diverse a collection of Delirious songs. I enjoyed every second of the experience. Unfortunately the only let down was that there were no songs from Delirious' most recent album, Audio Lessonover. Apart from that, though, this compilation is gold all around. If you know someone who has never heard of Delirious, make sure they obtain this album. It's definately worht it!"
4,They're still here!!!,"I say ""They're still here!!!"" because of the Christian sub-culture's tendency to forget a band if they don't regularly have releases. ""DEEPER"" is a fine compilation of Delirious songs with stellar versions of ""Did you feel the Mountains Tremble?"" ""I Could Sing of Your Love Forever"" and ""Come Like You Promise"" This is a great album for those just introduced to the band but does not provide enough for the fans who have been around. I think this compilation could of been condensed to one disc with more remixes and versions because some of the songs on the album are just not that popular or well-known. A remix or new version of ""Deeper"" should of been considered since it is the title track. No doubt all the songs are great and I highly reccomend this to any new fans because the best thus far is definitely on here."
5,Am I Delirious?,"This a very cool band. They have had some of them biggest worship songs of the 90s(""I Could Sing of Your Love"" and ""Did You Feel the Mountains Tremble"").If you have their album ""Cutting Edge"" you already have most of the songs(except some are remixes). But it is still cool to hear the songs ""Deeper"" and ""I Could Sing of Your Love"" on the same CD.One more thing their new CD ""Audio Lessonover"" comes out early next year(it's already out in the U.K.). I have a import version of it and there are some amazingly good songs on it. If you want it now you can get it on some U.K. online sites."
1,i'm chapped!!!,i have been very excitedly looking forward to this new cd. delirous' sound has been refreshing and new. but this cd appears to be nothing more than a collection of songs they have already done. is delirious just trying to make as much money as so-called secular bands??? i am very disappointed. where is Jesus in all this???????
3,Cutting Edge Part II,"Okay, don't get me wrong, I love the d:boys! But this is really just Cutting Egde II repackaged with a few re-mixes of the classics. Wondered how the marketing people were planning to attack this one? Also, I think the ""powers that be"" missed the boat on releasing ""I Could Sing of Your Love Forever"" and ""Did You Feel the Mountains Tremble?"" as singles the first time around. That ship has long left the shore. Can't wait for ""Audio Lessonover"" to hit in Spring 2002!"
4,Alot of great projects,I loved the shrug on the cover so bought this book. I will make plenty from this book. It was a good investment.
2,Listen to Yael,I should have listened to Yael's review... dead on. Nothing special about this book. I'll be donating it to the library.
4,I enjoy this book,"I have found quite a few projects in this book to be very nice. There are a total of 17 afghans for the home. There are 16 patterns for baby including afghans and outfits/bibs/socks. There are also pillows, tablerunners, tissuebox covers, wraps, cardigans, etc. They list 120 patterns. Not bad for the price. The pictures are nice and the directions are easy to follow.Granted, the patterns are not cutting edge or hip, just tried and true patterns that are enjoyable to do. The only thing I can find that is disapointing is that they do not tell you the Name Brand of the Yarn that was used and the exact color. They are specific, however, on the weight and amount of yarn. ie: medium worsted weight, #4, colors are listed."
3,another ordinary U.S. crochet book,"I'm usually looking for crochet books with garments and other items that are more stylish than what I found in this book. I also prefer crochet books that contain diagrams of crochet designs/garments, rather than just word instructions. This book failed on both these, for me. I'd say its an average American book on crochet."
4,well worth it,"i was well pleased with this book, so informative easy to read with loads of diagrams easy to follow patterns, i would recomend this book even if you are a beginnerBig Book Of Crochet (Leisure Arts #3850)"
2,This is censored,Why would you put out a dvd that is censored. Come on now I was hoping that we get to see them uncensored. Before you buy the dvd ask yourself is it really worth buying videos that you hoped to be uncensored but insted they're not. Hopefully they would put out a dvd with the uncensored material. Untill then save your money. But got to give it up for the videos.
3,Buyer Beware!,"I bought this dvd today without knowing the videos where EDITED. That makes me mad, don't get me wrong the videos are great to have and all, just wish they where all UNCENSORED."
1,weakest videoz,"censored? if you can live with that, then cool.no ""sour""? then forget about it.it's not worth the price and not have the best video they've ever done on here."
5,A Book for the Serious Seeker,"If you're a serious seeker after the things of God, you'll want to get a copy of this simple, but profound book. As you walk with the author from one room to another, you will find real ways to transform the secret places of your heart into a magnificent dwelling for God's presence. Written from personal experience, this book has an honest ring to it that is refreshing and encouraging."
5,wonderful knife book,My husband was thrilled with the book it will become an important part of is collection.
2,Bud Spencer-Man of Steal,"Flashback Christmas 1978. ""Superman-The Movie"" was playing to a packed house at a movie palace in downtown Philadelphia. Around the corner in a tiny bijou ""Charleston"" was playing out its one week engagement. Why did one movie capture the zeitgeist and the other not even draw flies? The thirty-five year mystery is solved. ""Charleston"" is a half-baked Italian rip-off of ""The Sting"". The byzantine plot concerns a dapper con artist(Bud Spencer) and his doltish minions trying to rip-off a stupid millionaire (James Coco) in a deal involving a luxury liner. Thrown into the mix is a stolen Gaugan. It gets so confusing that you don't care after a while. Sole selling point is Herbert Lom doing a riff on his Inspector Dreyfus character that played better when he was opposite Peter Sellers. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" fans should note the presence of Ronald Lacey who played Todt in that film."
3,Nice work but not cohesive,"Greg is a outrageously great musician. Form 3, with Azam Ali, is hypnotic and exactly what you would expect from Greg. However, this CD does not flow as a complete thematic musical work. Each song is named 'Form 1' through 'Form 10'. These songs are more like an experimental work in progress rather than a musical offering like you would expect on a CD. This is more like a reference than entertainment."
5,Unbelievably Beautiful!,"Each form is unique, loaded with sounds and ideas from a variety of cultures and times. Definetely a must for fans of drumming; fans of Hossam Ramzy for sure. Having Azam on as guest for two of the tracks was an exquisite bonus. Excellent work."
4,Very Good,"This CD is one of my favorites. Tormenting vocals, great guitars... This CD though is not for people who dont like death metal or hardcore."
1,Soul Embraced making a come back...,Just when you thought they were done...they're back...in a Big Way and better than ever!! All new coming soon
1,This doesn't even deserve ONE star!,"This band's got a good drummer (also Evanescence's drummer). That is how I heard of Soul Embraced. I thought, ""Hey! Evanescence's album, 'Fallen' is the best I own, so I'd guess that since the drummer originally belonged to this hardcore band Soul Embraced, I should give them a try!"". What a dumb thing to think. The guitar work is cheap, the guy's vocals don't sound like screaming or singing or anything besides an old exhaust pipe. Give me a break. If you want some awesome metal, check out These 5 Down or Living Sarifice. Zao and Demon Hunter are good as well. Just do me the loving favor of NEVER buying this album."
3,Excellent album,"This is an excellent thrash metal album. The vocals remind me a bit of the black metal style. A previous reviewer made the comment that Soul Embraced's drummer is the same drummer from Evanescence. This is actually not correct. The drummer for Soul Embraced is Lance Garvin, he was also the drummer for Living Sacrifice until they disbanded about a year ago. The guitarist for Soul Embraced is Rocky Gray. He was also one of the guitarists for Living Sacrifice. Rocky Gray is the drummer for Evanescence. This album is excellent. Though not quite as good as ""This is my blood"". But that's just my opinion."
5,"A mix between MuDvAyNe, Zao, and Living Sacrifice","This CD is awesome. A different sound from ""This is My Blood"" and it is not as heavy, but definately catchier. You must get this!"
5,Soul Embraced----My new favorite Solid State band!,"I got Solid State 3 for christmas and there was an older soul embraced song on it. I didn't really like it that much, but then a little while later, i bought Solid State 4 and they had a newer soul embraced song. It was just aWESOME!!!! So i got there cd and they r just really AWESOME!!!! Another good heavy metal band to add to my heavy metal collection."
5,Magnificent collection of writers in the key of jazz.,"Most authors express the belief that the short story is the most difficult format to execute. Developing characters and advancing plot(s) in the space limitations can tax the most gifted of writers.Leave it to Robert Randisi to assemble a collection of fascinating short mysteries with a jazz theme that belie the conventional wisdom.His ""Murder and All That Jazz"" boasts a roster filled with Edgar, Shamus and Agatha winners.The baker's dozen tales all sparkle...my particular favorites were penned by Laura Lippman, Les Roberts, Michael Connelly, Julie Smith and Mr. Randisi.A pleasure from start to finish. Enjoy this one and get an introduction to some writers you may not have known."
2,Good for jazz fans,"This volume of short mystery stories all connected to jazz should be a favorite for those who love both. The stories' settings range from ""the jazz age"" to contemporary, from New Orleans to St. Louis. Many of them are peppered with names that true jazz aficionados will recognize. Authors in the anthology are: Craig Holden, John Lutz, Martin Meyers, Max Allan Collins & Matthew V. Clemens, John Harvey, Peter Robinson, Bill Moody, Michael Connelly, Les Roberts, Julie Smith, Ed Gorman, Laura Lippman, and Rober J. Randisi, who also edited.The good:A wide variety of stories and styles.If you're a big jazz fan, you'll enjoy the inclusion in many of the stories of jazz greats.The bad:If you're not a big jazz fan, the references may leave you cold or confused.Some of the stories were of the literary, see-how-smart-I-am variety, and not really mysteries at all.The verdict:Best for literati jazz fans, but there are still a few good stories for the rest of us."
4,Perhaps the Second Lesson,"This book is a classic in the Libertarian movement, and is thus somewhat untouchable. It is a great book, offering Bergland's brand of Libertarianism and many libertarian solutions in a simple yet thought-provoking fashion.However, it is very dry and will not appeal to all. Those who couldn't care less about economics would not like this book. Granted, most Libertarians do care about them but that is only after realizing how economic liberty is really not separate from personal liberty.I'd recommend this as a primer for those who are new to the movement but already consider themselves Libertarians. For those who aren't I'd recommend something like Harry Browne's Great Libertarian Offer, Virginia Postrel's The Future and Its Enemies, or a few current issues of Reason magazine to give you an impression of what Libertarianism, the politics of free minds and free markets, is all about."
5,Libertarianism,"When young I first registered Democrat. After my discharge from the U.S. Army in 1970 I registered to vote as a Republican. A couple years later I met a Libertarian and from Mark Hinkle's enthusiastic talk I registered Libertarian too. After the Savings & Loan ""bubble"" burst I saw a copy of Libertarianism in One Lesson in a used book store, purchased it and have recommended it to many friends and relatives ever since. This copy I purchased used too after I recommended it to a co-worker but could not find mine at home. This is the ninth edition so it has been updated more than once since first I read it and David Bergland who was our Presidential candidate a couple decades ago has a good grasp on what thinking Libertarian could be. It could be that many of you could be Libertarian too once you see how the Demilcans and Repicrats are one party having ""a party"" while ripping off the American taxpayer. Taxpayers like you and me."
5,"a quick, succinct intro","This is a good introduction for anyone wanting to learn more about libertarianism. It's nice and short and only tackles the principles of libertarianism rather than taking a lot of time to focus on the ""mechanics"" of making it work. I would recommend it to anyone libertarians, liberals, communists) who wants to learn about different ideologies. There are plenty of books that focus on how a libertarian society could be established, so read those if you're looking for a ""how to"" book. Read this book if you want to get to know libertarianism a bit more."
5,Great way to make durable art!,"Our son did his first make-a-plate when he was 11 months old as part of an activity with a MOMS Club, and we've been hooked. We have his first scribbles and his handprint saved forever on a plate that he can use. It has been really durable, washes well, won't break when dropped etc.I also think this is a great value. You have to pay a little extra for shipping and handling, but the kit comes with several sheets (in case the little artist needs a few tries to get it right) and with a full set of Crayola washable markers. The markers bought alone are at least $4, which makes the kit a great deal in my opinion.We're starting a family tradition that the kiddos get to make a plate on new years day and then use it as their special plate that year for birthdays, pancake breakfast etc. Lots of fun."
5,Fun for years,"Our family made these plates back in the 80s and we still have and use ours. I think these are great fun, great gifts and a great experience. We did them as a family and it's begun a tradition carried on now for two generations. It's not fine china but durable and a great tradition for just about everyone"
2,Jipped,Of course they do not mention how you have to pay extra for shipping and handling and processing. It cost me a lot more. I would not have gotten it if I had known I had to pay 6 bucks per plate for processing (I have 3 children) plus 10 more dollars for shipping! It is not worth all the expense... I will not use this product again and I will beware of this companies products...
5,Unique take on Arthur's widow,"While my favorite version of the Arthurian Legend has been ""The Mists of Avalon"", this version of Guinevere is a distinctly unique take and imagines an entirely different kind of heroine.After Arthur's death, Guinevere must fend for herself in the power vacuum it creates. Goodwin takes us on a surprising and unexpected journey with her as she survives through the years that follow. A powerful figure who must come to terms with the twists and turns of her destiny, she is sometimes frustrating, but always admirable. A must read for those who are captivated by the Legend."
4,"Interesting, but a bit disappointing after its prequel, Firelord","In Firelord, Arthur tells his story from his deathbead, while in Beloved Exile Guinevere tells her surprising story of the next forty years. In Beloved Exile, more so than in Firelord, Godwin's imagination is free to run. The result is interesting, but with less of the high drama of Firelord.In both novels Godwin explores the difference between British and Saxon societies: the former being aristocratic, kin-based, honour-bound, poetic and chivalric; the latter much more democratic, land-based, law-bound, prosaic and pedestrian. These are stereotypes, for sure, but it gives the novels a sense that something is at stake in the struggle between the two societies.Godwin's portrait of Guenevere as a woman of power is compelling. Her power comes from her intelligence, pragmatism, and royal birth (unlike in lesser novels where she is often portrayed as a warrior-princess, or mystical priestess, or girl-next-door)."
5,Harley Davidson oil patch cap,"My son in Law thought this was a fabulous item and was very happy with the cap. quality was great and price even better. would buy from again, I kept thier card."
1,Nonstick is a poor choice,"I had two problems with this product: 1) it came with some kind of industrial sticky-stuff that attached the removable bottom to the rim. After cooking a tart in the pan and several washings, it's still not all gone. 2) Non-stick, I now realize (and Cook's Illustrated confirms) is a terrible choice for a tart pan. Tart dough is usually high in fat, and needs something to grip. In this pan, the dough just slides right down the nonstick insides of the pan"
3,Good product but it has a removable bottom that I didn't expected...,"When I bought this one, nothing in the description was saying it had a removable bottom.So it ended that I received a nice product but not at all what I was looking for ! :-("
4,Two-Piece Pan,"Good enough. The only mistake I made was not realizing that this is a two-piece pan, like all the ones in the stores. I was looking for a single piece pan that would not leak. Convergence; why doesn't anyone think to sell a one-piece?"
5,Finance book review,Not necessarily required for class but helped me get an A. Good book. I will probably keep it. I bought the study guide from school which was essential to pass the class.
3,Not the right book.,"You've got the wrong picture on this book. I was led to think I was ordering the textbook, not this."
1,Fundamentals of Finance,This item did not arrive to me as the package was damaged at the post office.
3,An average book with an above average premise,"This is the story of Regan Ford - a bartender (woman) who is on the run from her past.It's also the story of Josh McCall - a nosy cop who's taken an interest in Regan Ford.*spoiler warning*Regan had, in her recent past - been stalked by a cop. He stalked her, killed her fiancee and her partner, and framed her for it. She's hiding from him and terrified he'll find her.The Hero in the story just ticks me off. She says ""leave me alone"" and he won't. Looks like the woman is just a stalker magnet.About half way through the story, I wanted her to taser him and walk away. But of course she didn't.I found the romance here COMPLETELY unbelievable. The love of her life is dead, murdered. She's got a new stalker, but is gonna fall in love with him? Don't think so.But it was entertaining. And the bad guy gets it in the end, so I suppose it's all ok.In the end, I wish I'd skipped it.(*)>"
5,Impressive First Novel,"It is always a pleasure to discover a new author whose work is so well written that it keeps me glued to my chair as I read page after page of a well-wrought, tightly woven mystery. The theft of a famous painting brings together an international cast of interesting and in some cases frightening characters from Japan, New York, London and Spain. Add a fascinating plot, love, murder, betrayal, surprising twists and turns at the most unexpected times -- and you have one heck of good read from a new author who makes his debut with this impressive first novel. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a fast-paced mystery thriller."
3,Immortal In Death,Have enjoyed reading the first and third books of this series so far. They are easy reading and hold your interest.
4,A good read,I love the dynamic between eve and Rourke. the story is never boring even though I figured out the bad early on.
4,Good Book,I have read all of thr J D Robb books now. They are great as all books by Nora Roberts are. This is a si-fi book. Good mistery story. Easy to read. Hard to put down.
5,Great read,"Have become a huge fan of the ""death"" books as they always have danger associated with a super mystery, plus some humor to ease the tension."
3,A little off center,"I thought the character development in this novel was wonderful, making Eve and company jump of the page moreso than ever before. It was the murder investigation side that lacked in this entry. Bringing Mavis in as a potential killer was just too silly, followed by the nearly interchangeable actor/producer characters, topped off by two catty feuding models.This was still a good fluff read, just not up with the previous two entries in the series."
2,Easy to read,"If you enjoy Eve Dallas novels and don't mind the repetition, you may enjoy this book. Sometimes you need to get away from good literature and just enjoy something you don't have to think about."
4,"Good, but the wedding bummed me out","I liked this one, but I was really not happy with the way the wedding played out at the end. It just seemed kind of anticlimactic. The overall premise of the story just wasn't as appealing to me as a lot of her other books. I did like it, but I didn't love it."
5,JD Robb is always the best!!,I have read almost all of the JD Robb books. This was just another great read.I like how the story flows and it never seems to get boring. I never get enough.
4,Works great with vista,"Excellent sound, way better than my onboard sound card which i was using before. Works great with vista, just make sure you use the drivers online."
4,Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi PCI,This is a great upgrade from the built in sound found on most motherboards. The only caveat is the drivers that Creative supplies don't work too well with Windows. If you buy this card download the Daniel K. modded drivers found here: [...] I had many problems installing this card to windows XP Pro Sp3 until I found these drivers. These installed flawlessly on both Win XP and Win7 machines. Performance is top notch and my music sounds great. Would have given a 5 star rating if driver installation was easier. This is a very good piece of hardware that comes with mediocre drivers. You MUST use the Daniel K drivers.
3,Works Only If System Tweaked,"After installing software from both package and Creative's site for Win7 system with 4G Mem, sound board would work for the first split second then the sound would cut out and stop. Despite returning the card, I read several forums regarding problem. One solution was to change the system memory to reflect 3990M. The card worked with the change. The sound is great as advertised. If you are strictly plug and play, the card is not for you."
2,"Average sound card, definately not extreme","I already had a creative B100 Digital 5.1 card that had great sound, but because I love to advance my gaming experience I believed the hipe on this card. It is no extreme sound gaming card and does not let you hear the ""footsteps"" in says you can hear while in stealth mode. I see no differnce in this card and my B100 except the consoles offer more adjustments, which make little or no difference anyway. This card did not perform as adverstised."
4,"Fine Product, mixed price","This is a fine product. However, Amazon has a very funny pricing policy. I came to them in hopes of getting a fair price. Two days after I ordered the card, they cut the price by 5 bucks. This week I found it at Best Buy for $10 less. So; shop around."
4,Problems wirh Windows XP SP3 and latest (June 2008) Drivers,"If you are using an analog microphone with this soundcard and are using Windows XP with service pack 3 you will not be able to use your microphone plugged into the back of this card. However, the front panel microphone connection will work (if you have it hooked up to your case).The microphone connection on the back of this card is the white top-most connector (not the pink connector, which is usually the standard). This white jack is called a ""flexijack"" by Creative, and it is supposed to sense what type of device you have plugged into it and allow you to use it as a microphone jack. It doubles as a ""Digital I/O"" or ""Mic in / Line in"" jack.The current drivers for Windows XP from creative (as of June '08) do not work properly and you will not be able to configure the ""flexijack"" as a microphone connection.Aside from the microphone issue the soundcard works fine."
4,great for games and ASIO support is good too,"I needed a gaming card and one with ASIO support for home based recording. All my music hardware is USB based and I've got 7ms or less of latency with all of them. This includes an Axiom 61 midi controller keyboard, Guitar Rig 3 software edition without their Rig Control unit, and Line 6 Toneport UX2. So far I'm totally satisfied and don't expect to have to buy a 'pro quality' soundcard which is BIG bucks. All my games sound great. Highly recommended for at home musicians and gamers."
4,Don't even try onboard sound,"This is so much of an upgrade from onboard it's ridiculous. I have these paired up with my Audio Technica ATH-AD700's and there's no comparison to the sound quality of anything you've heard before. (Unless, of course, you have a more expensive set up, but then why would you be looking at this?) The Creative Control Panel lets you fine-tune settings to your liking, and has preset modes for different types of listening. Entertainment mode is great for movies and music, placing you right there in the studio/theater. Sound Creation mode is my favorite for listening to music, as it literally sounds like you're at a live recording. It's quite scary, really. Game mode, especially when paired with my headphones, is where this card really shines. sound direction is amazing, totally blew my 5.1 system out of the water, and provides sound quality so great you just can't get on onboard sound. Get this card, you truly won't be disappointed."
5,Good card for upgrading old Motherboards to Windows-7!,"This card installed cleanly and came up without issue under Windows-7. I have recently updated my system to Windows-7 and needed to find a sound card with a good Windows-7 driver.This card works great under Windows-7 - has low latency and not ""warble"" like other sound cards."
5,Well...it worked with my motherboard.,"FANTASTIC sound for the money! (seems to work well with Asus P5W DH, anyway) Nice crisp highs, decent mid-range and unmuddied lows make this an excellent pick, IMO. The only down-side I could find is some of the nonsense-software included is, well, nonsense.Creative scores, again."
3,Creative drives do not work with Dell and Windows 7,"There is a known issue with creative sound cards and Windows7 when running on Dell XPS 710 (and probably other Dell boxes.) The sound is broken up and crackling and sounds awful and is generally impossible to understand. Since I could not use the card, I really don't know how this works. P.S. this card worked fine in while under Windows XP. So I had to return."
5,Plug & Play,"I bought this card to free up my CPU from the integrated sound. I am running XP and all I needed to do was diable my integrated sound card in BIOS, plug in card and install drivers. The card is great and does exactly what the manufacturer states. Shipping from Amazon was awesome. It arrived in the promised time, even during the holiday rush period. I will definately be buying from Amazon again!"
4,"Great sound card, software mostly great","The card rocks on Windows Vista. The new software really brings out sounds and makes GREAT use of the subwoofer for video games as well as for listening to music. Two gripes. First, the legacy Creative Media Source 5 Player does not work correctly with Windows Vista, it was designed for XP. There is a separate X-Fi volume control that does work with Vista. They should have one integrated panel that is fully functional with Vista. Second gripe, unless you buy an add-on, you can only burn/rip WMA format, you can't burn MP-3s or any other sound format to disk, portable player or to your computer. You are stuck with WMA unless you buy the $10 recording pack. Granted, not big bucks, but should be part of the package, not an add-on. Bottom line, great card, some software is great, other parts are either outdated or missing, worth the upgrade if you have Windows Vista."
4,Great Card,"Overall an awesome card with so many cool features except for one thing, for some reason, when you play High Definition videos, there is no audio playback yet other, standard definition videos, you can hear just fine.The only way you can hear the playback on HD movie files is to preview them in a movie editor program like Pinnacle Studio. I've contacted customer support, they say you need a new codec downloaded, have not found it yet but I'm still looking.Other than that, I have no issues with this Card, it is AWE-Some!"
3,sound card,"Hello, I purchased this card nearly a year ago and now find the right rear surround speaker stops emitting sound after maybe fourty five minutes...I'll give a guess that either the chip get buggy when warmed up or the 64bit OS is some how to blame. The 64 bit been an endless pain in the butt! Other wise great sound can be achieved with this card. I find myself always fiddling with the adjustments with each song."
2,Good hardware spoiled by bad drivers,"The Creative drivers are dreadful. Even the signed Creative Inc drivers crashed my brand new clean Vista x64 installation. Do a web search on ""ha20x2k.sys BSOD"" and you'll see all the users who had the dreaded ""Blue Screen of Death"" from these drivers. I've had to disable much of the functionality and use just the generic Microsoft WHQL drivers. I won't ever buy another Creative product again. As enticing as their hardware features are, their poor driver quality just ruins everything."
4,A worthwile addition to your collection,"Personally, I've always enjoyed live albums more. On this particualr CD, you can hear the crowds displeasure at the end of Black Orpheus, and conversely, a murmur of approval when Mercy, Mercy, Mercy is intorduced. Perhaps not the greatest recording ever created by the group, but certainly noteworthy. The Experience in E track is especially interesting."
5,rob bell 's teachings are amazing,"I was at the taping of everything is spiritual event and was amazed with Rob Bell's teaching. My family has been waiting a long time for it to be available on dvd. There is so much to it that we could not recall it all when trying to explain to friends what it was about. I highly recomend this dvd. I have heard him preach a few times and just saw his new tour the gods aren't angry,(once again, we are wanting the dvd now) I am always suprised by how I get a new perspective on a passage I have read over and over, never quite looking close enough at it to gain further understanding.His knowledge of Jewish customs and history adds value to his teachings. This is well worth the money. also, check out his NOOMA dvds they are excellent as well."
5,Great DVD for beginners,"I'm buying it for everyone I've always wanted to talk into trying yoga :) The DVD includes:(1) an introducton to yoga basics(2) a level 1 (beginner) session with three students demonstrating the beginner, intermediate, and advanced versions of the poses, so you can continue to progress with this DVD over time(3) a more difficult session demonstrated by Romy(4) descriptions of basic yoga posesAudio can be set to English or Spanish."
4,"Dated threat and scenario, but excellent operational details","Originally written as an official manual in 1985. This book details the efforts of a Canadian mechanized brigade to hold up the Soviet advance for 48 hours during the early stages of WWIII in Central Europe. The text is focused at the Battle Group/Combat Team level, following the activity from the assembly area to performing a withdrawal under pressure."
2,j.f.,"This was not as good as some of his other books, but i think he is an amazing writer. It was worth reading."
2,Not a New Edition,"This is an excellent dictionary if you do not already have an earlier edition, but this is not a new edition. It is an exact reproduction of the 1987 Random House Dictionary of the English Language, Second Edition, Unabridged, in a smaller page size, with six and half pages of ""new words"" in a separate section, and most of the original front matter and supplements (appendices) removed. Many of the ""new words"" are are new to this dictionary but not to the language, such as ""wishing well"" and ""gematria,"" which the etymology says first appeared in 1685-95. The CD-ROM is a newer version (3.0) of the software engine than previous editions, but contains the same text as the book, with the ""new words"" and a few last-minute additions integrated into the main dictionary. In a couple of months, the CD-ROM will be available separately."
1,13 years old!,"This is page for page identical to the 1987 edition. All the population figures are from the 1980 census or earlier. Elements 104-107 don't have names. 200 pages of appendices deleted, 6 pages of new words added. Country names and biographical data is updated. Avoid."
4,A very impressive dictionary,"I do agree with Stuart regarding the CD-ROM (although I've not seen the MS-DOS version) in that the definitions are abridged (vis-a-vis the book) and the search engine is nothing to write home about.Apropos the book, the pros far outweighs the cons. I'm not a lexicographer but amongst the many dictionaries that I've come across, this one is the most exhaustive and definitive in terms of explaining the words, and it's etymology.But I think the book would have fared better had it included examples of common usages of the word in the context of current spoken and written english.Coming back to the CD-ROM, the clincher is the inclusion of recorded pronunciation of most of the words (reportedly some 120,000 of them) which helps in setting to rest most debates on how a word is to be pronounced !All in all, if you want just one dictionary for your library, this is the one to have."
3,Good Basic Ditionary,"First drawback to this program is the very poor help function. Quite a bit of information about the program is missing in the help part of the program. Example X-Ref button, its displayed in the printed documentation, but no explanation of what it does. You cant find any reference to it at all by accessing help within the program. You can however find an explanation in the readme30 document on the cd-rom. The online help button in the program just links you to the Microsoft web site, WHY ? Second - poor integration into word. Even though there are explicit instructions I could not get it to integrate into Word 2000 under WindowsME. Perhaps it works under Windows98?Good points:1) No bugs or errors running the program itself.2) Found every word I was looking for.3) Excellent customizable dictionary.All things taken into consideration I dont think you will find a better dictionary for the price."
1,Produced by GERD ROCHEL,".This CD is the re-issue of her album'1986.This album was produced by Gerd Rochel (BERNHARD BRINK, DANUTA, INGRID PETERS, JUERGEN DREWS, The LORDS, OHIO EXPRESS, PATTY RYAN, The TREMELOES, WENCKE MYHRE).Pay attention to Gerd Rochel's song ""Don't Tell Me Lies"".Also, don't forget her second album ""Top Of The Line"" (also produced by GERD ROCHEL)."
1,Gerd Rochel ruled,".This CD is the re-issue of her album'1986.This album was produced by Gerd Rochel (BERNHARD BRINK, DANUTA, INGRID PETERS, JUERGEN DREWS, The LORDS, OHIO EXPRESS, PATTY RYAN, The TREMELOES, WENCKE MYHRE).Pay attention to Gerd Rochel's song ""Don't Tell Me Lies"".."
2,"wake up, people","Comon, headbangers. I like progressive metal as much as the next guy, but..... Jeff Gilbert said it best when this CD was resleased, and I quote ""sounds like somebody slamming an aluminum door over and over really fast. Judging from the anguished and rasping vocals, the singer's fingers were in the way"". 'Nuff said.THB from Atlanta."
4,There's something missing here...,"Am I the only one feeling a bit letdown by this record? After a 3 year or so absence I was expecting a little bit more from this (still) brilliant band. Starting on the record time itself - only 30 or so minutes of effective music, if you discount the last 10 minutes of pure noise. What about the jazzy parts? And the whole rhythm complexity showed on the masterpiece ""Destroy Erase Improve""? As well as the brilliant music endings of the previous record. This time we get a lot of straight and simple fade-outs. So, why do I give it 4 stars? Because the musicianship is awesome, the sound is superb and probably because we, the Meshuggah fans, were a bit spoiled by the bands previous brilliant offerings. We just can't be geniuses all the time...Lets keep the faith, though.Gonalo Baro da Cunha"
4,Good but not near Destroy Erase Improve,"I have been a Meshuggah fan for several years now and I completely love thier highly technical use of polyrythms and syncopation. Chaosphere is killer but not without its faults. For one thing, every song is the exact same tempo. Another thing is that every riff has no more than 3 or so chords. Even though they play the hell out of those 3, Meshuggah would be so much better if they would get a bit more fret-happy. All in all, a great, aggressive album that most long time fans will like."
3,Brief bruisings,"This metal band can deliver potent bursts of well produced momentum, but it usually ends up being short lived while repetitiously bleeding into each song."
4,Metal Mastery,"Again, the Mesh boys show us how far they can push the musical boundaries. The only reason this isn't a 5 star is because it's not quite up to par with Destroy Erase Improve. DEI seemed to be a lot more 'listenable' where Chaosphere seems a little bit more scrambled. The only other negative is the end of ""Elastic"" where the cd crashes into this seizure inducing noise. Maybe I'm just a wimp but it's definately not pleasing to listen to. Don't get me wrong. Meshuggah is way above more 'popular' bands like Pantera & Metallica. Meshuggah would eat those bands alive. Standout tracks are ""Neurotica"" & ""The Mouth Licking What You've Bled"" (bonus points for extra strange song title)"
3,Not as good as Destroy Erase Improve,"I have all of Meshuggah's releases and was priveliged enough to see them live twice while they were in the US, and I have to say that I really do not like this album as much as I was expecting to. On this new record, it seems that their musical direction is changing and turning more and more similar as their lead guitarist's side project, Special Defects. It does not have the jazz interludes that D.E.I. had and all the riffs are the same speed and same structure. I did not think I would be saying this, but if you want to get bored really quick, then buy this album and listen to it once. And a note to their guitarist Fredrik, leave your side project out of Meshuggah and maybe the next album will be better. But if you want a good album buy this one's predecesor, Destroy Erase Improve, and you will know what I am talking about."
4,Fu king heavy,This is a very brutal cd. Every song is perfect for breaking your neck. I think it is meshuggah's best work
3,Where'd the melody go?,"I currently own two Meshuggah albums...Chaosphere and their older, Contradictions Collapse. Chaosphere is like being brutally beaten in the head with a frying pan, that's the only way to describe it. With the fast, thrashy vocals, Meshuggah's double bass pounds in your head....and when mixed with heavily distorted guitars, it is a sonic massacre. Now on to the bad side of this album: after listening to this album the first time, I was a bit peeved that most of the songs sounded the same. The more I listened to it, the more I realized that they really are very similar in sound and structure...and also unfortuantely lacked any semblance of a melody.Overall:Head banging- 8/10Talent- 5/10Melody- 1/10I'd say listen to some tracks from Destroy Erase Improve or Contradictions Collapse and buy one of those instead, BUT if you already have every other album by Meshuggah, then buy this one."
1,most over rated metal band ever,"how is this band considered ""technical""? i have yet to hear anything remotely technical at all. these guys rely on detuned 7 string or 8 string guitars too much and basicly chug away in the simplest most annoying manner. every song is basicly the same key being chugged away with some half assed screaming and drumming.how these guys have a fan base is beyond me. take away the detuned guitars and you have something even more boring.i tried to enjoy this band and have consistantly come to the conclusion that they really really suck.these guys cant hold a candle to awesome ""technical"" bands like, Nile, Between the buried and me, cannibal corpse, metallica during the 80's and even fricken static X, which it seems these guys try so hard to sound like lol."
5,Crazy and Chaotic Indeed,"Meshuggah delivers again with their 3rd album, ""Chaosphere"", and it is one album that you will never want to remove from your CD player. Aghh...just try to keep up with the guitars and Tomas Haake's blastbeats.Another great thing about Meshuggah is that they refuse to follow ANY formula in their songwriting. This is a puzzling album not for the weak listener. However, if you're a fan of downtuned riffage, you will enjoy this, and be able to access the technical metal world without any problem.True, this band is from Sweden, but they don't specialize in the melodeath department. They are a whole different league. One of the most dynamic, talented, barrier breaking bands to come out of the 90's metal scene.If you are a fan of bands like Fear Factory, Machine Head, The Dillinger Escape Plan and Necrophagist, you will not hate this."
3,This will make you think,"Upon listening a few times, this album is thought provoking. The textures of extreme blend with jaunts of harmonies. For the elite or those who would appreciate a standard in album collections."
4,CrAZy,"Meshuggah is probably the heaviest band that I have ever heard. They are also very original in their musicianship in that they have almost no melody and the rhythmic force is the guitars. This band does have a lot of talent unlike what many of the one star reviews say (especially the one guy who says that instead of this you should listen to dream theater that recently are nothing but dueling keyboard and guitar solos ever 5 seconds). Even though this band does have talent and are original, the vocals are harsh and abrasive and I am more of a fan of the music of porcupine tree or other atmospheric progressive bands. I appreciate meshuggah's style and complex rhythms, however I prefer music with a little more I guess substance. But if you like incredibly odd time signeratures and heavy 7 string guitars and abrasive vocals, this is the album for you."
2,"Seller review, not item review",$12.95 for shipping in 3-5 days via usps....but priority mail is only $9 for 2 days via usps.price gouging. I'll buy elsewhere next time. :(
3,Way too expensive,SimplYoz.com has crumbles for much less. Violet crumbles are very good. If you don't want to look elsewhere buy them here
3,The only thing violet is the wrapper,"Crunchy, chewy, and a nice flavor, but only a homesick expat would pay a that much for a case of this stuff. For someone like me who tried it as an adult and liked it, but not enough to buy another one at a buck and a quarter, I can't quite see the excitement.I suppose if I had to live somewhere without my favorite candies I'd understand better and would be ordering something vile like Good 'n Plenty for a taste of home. mad-haus 11 June 2004."
5,worth the price!,"I realize that most people would see the price and think that was ridiculous to pay for a candy bar, but for an occasional treat it is well worth the price. The chocolate on the outside is of excellent quality, not sickening sweet like some milk chocolates are. The texture of the center is unlike any candy bar I have tried. Cadbury crunchy bar is similar, but much sweeter. Too sweet I think. Worth trying, you will not be dissapointed"
3,"I like it, but","I love this candy bar. There is nothing wrong with the product, however; it took me a month to receive this. Next time I will purchase directly from one of many Australia online stores. I purchased from an online store once, it arrived here within a week."
3,"Buy this for the overtures but ""Harold"" is dreadful","This recording sounds beautiful in its SACD remastering and Munch's exciting and spontaneous way with the overtures keeps it in my collection. The recording of ""Harold"" is regrettably off. Despite his affinity for Berlioz, the conductor's tempi seem inappropriate in every movement. I'd recommend the Naxos recording with Talmi, or Bernstein's NY Phil. recording on Sony."
5,refreshing!!,This is a refreshing product that does a great job of clearing and calming skin - it's fabulous!! You can buy a smaller bottle and even keep it in your purse to spritz throughout the day - it wont mess up your makeup.
3,Just Okay ..,to Start with the packing for this prodcut was horrible i got this one with a broken lid . Used this product for one and half weeks continously..nothing spcl just like normal water.. no improvement of skin.. however it might be useful on a suuny day ..for its price its too expensive .
5,steely has stolen me!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"One of my favorite thing about Steely, and consequentially, I guess, her music is her/it's assertiveness and aggression and yet its liling, almost pathetic pathos. On the one hand, there's steely Herself, charismatic but really down deep, really deep, I mean, weak. Weak for Love, that is. I call it ""ELI'S LOVE"" because that's what it is. It's almost exactly like she met some guy poolside at some hotel in Vegas who she didn't even know and was nice to him just to be nice, but then unexpectedly fell for him head over toe, but then had to leave because the plane was about to take off and this record is the final teary kiss good-bye. This record transported me to another, alternative, fantasy planet where we all see what we want, but in the end get what we deserve, but that ends up to be the best thing for us anyways even though we don't know it at the time..."
5,How can you put it in words when it comes from the soul?,"Steely's music has a depth so few can understand and feel unless you have walked in those shoes. If the shoe fits you will know what I am talking about. Great work, absolutely love it, can't wait for the next chapter in her music, her voice and lyrics promise so much more..........................."
1,Bad Acting...,"This movie had so many elements that made it bad. It lacked almost everything.So movie is about this asteroid deal that breaks up and the bigger half is headed for the Earth. It missed the Earth but it somehow shifts the Earth's orbit closer to the sun. People start dehydrating, dying, etc. For some odd reason, only a couple of people can survive and try to make it North.Bad plot. It should have had more buildup at the beginning. The Earth gets hit or not should have lasted a little longer. It all happened very quickly. It was unreasonable that at 139 degrees, the people were wearing long sleeves and with minimal sweat.Bad acting. It was like they picked people off the street and gave them a chance. They have no personalities whatsoever, makes you lose interest very fast.Overall, i dont recommend the movie. Bad plot and bad acting. Good to see once, but only if you are very bored."
3,Good low budget end of world saga,"The special effects could be better, but this episodic end-of-world adventure kept me interested, as a group of survivors attempt to escape escalating heat to cooler climates up north. Yeah, the acting is silly at points, and some of the characters are annoying. Still, i enjoyed it as a Casper Van Dien vehicle. As usual, he's the hero who tries to do the right thing."
3,Chemistry and cliches abound,"After a disagreement with her boss over how the luxury hotel should be managed, Gracie impulsively returns to the US to relax in Seagull Point Virginia. Being a high strung career gal, she soon looks for a project to keep her busy and falls in love with a Victorian mansion she wants to turn into a B&B.; But first she has to get by the caretaker, Kevin, who would rather lie in a hammock then listen to her proposal. But opposites attract and Gracie is willing to do anything to get her hands (and hammer) on the property.Despite the two having a lot of chemistry between the leads (if you can get beyond the constant uttering his ENTIRE name), the story is so laden with clichés and relatives that have massive growth spurts (his niece ages overnight), that it never quite makes it a compelling read. I tend to love everything penned by Sherryl Woods, but this out of print story is poorly edited and just not worth the effort to locate."
4,Leaves you with a Smile!,"What a sweet, funny romance! Gracie quits her hotel management job in France and goes to only place that holds a fond memory - small resort town in Virginia. Once there is falls for an old Victorian house that thinks would make a wonder B&B. The only stumbling block is the man (Kevin) who `kind-a' owns the property - and he doesn't want to sell. Kevin and Gracie have great chemistry and the book makes you smile from beginning to end - you can't beat that! Enjoy!"
4,Interesting,"An interesting video about the Olympic, Titanic, and Britannic. However it contributes little information that can't be found elsewhere. Also, it is odd when the ask the question ""Were these jems of the White Star Line jinxed?"" However, this becomes less important when John Maxtone-Graham clearly says something to the effect of ""sometimes weird things happen."" Anyway, if you have a collection of Titanic books and videos, this would make a great addition!"
2,Not as good as his acting,"This hurts me to say it -- how can I put this? -- He is a much better actor than singer. The only song of his I like -and I love it- is ""Weight of a Man,"" and that's not on this CD. The best part of this CD is the picture on the cover. (Ok, I can breathe again now.) I like the intensity of his persona, and his singing just doesn't match up."
3,Other ways of speaking- Russell Crowe,"I am very disappointed with this cd- i enjoy, Russell Crowe singing and acting. Why is it, that this is the first time,i have been disappointed in buying a cd from company. On the back of cd-there are listed 15 tunes- number 14- farm noises is not noted as being played- but, i neither hear tune 13 or 15.. One of all,i am interestedin hearing is FOLSOM PRISON BLUES. WHEN I PHONED AMAZON- THEY SAID- THAT THERE WAS NO FOLSOM PRISON BLUES- AS THE LAST TUNE- OR NOT INCLUDED AT ALL- THAT FARM NOISES IS THE LAS TUNE- NO SOUNDTRACK- WHY IS THIS CD- BEING MISREPRESENTED."
3,I'll give Russell a little credit...,"I didn't enjoy this CD as much as ""Bastard Life,"" but I still have to give Russell Crowe kudos for writing his own stuff. Extra kudos for the cover of ""Folsom Prison."""
1,LIKE THE SMEAR OF RED LIPSTICK ON A HOBO,I'm not quite sure what the others are basing the positive reviews on... the lyrics are ill at ease and the vocals by Mr. Crow are underwhelming and actually a bit embarrassing for the listener.Put some lipstick on ugly and its just painted ugly.
1,Terrible ways of singing,"I've got Gaslight and Clarity and I really like them both, but this one is terrrible and absolutely disharmonious."
5,Expected better and got much more,"I expected that the quality of OWOS would be better than BLOC, but in truth, it was so much better than I expected. If you remember riding down the road tapping your fingers along to your new 8-track of Simon and Garfunkel (and if that doesn't ""date"" me, nothing will) ... this is a CD for you. A fresh feel to the words and the music puts itself together into a great package.If you love rock and roll with words you can understand and learn, buy this CD."
2,I just don't like this album,"The only song on this album that I found to be interesting is Mission Beat. Other then that all the songs sound much like Gaslight and BLOC, which aren't anthing to ""write home about"". Unlike his wife, Danielle Spencer, who has an absolutly beautiful voice, Russell's doesn't do anything for me. I always have felt that he sounds off key. Also, as another reviewer said, I don't like that the band is Russell Crowe and TOFOG now. And I don't like that the band is not featured the same way Russell is on the cover."
3,Wrong Artist Credits,"Some of these Artist credits are wrong. Here are the correct ones :""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" = Queensryche""Tomorrow Never Knows"" = Billy Idol""Magical Mystery Tour"" = Yngwie, Jeff Scott Soto""Revolution (9)"" = Billy Gibbons, Vivian Campbell""Daytripper"" = Jack Blades/Tommy Shaw""I Feel Fine"" = John Bush, Stef Carpenter""Taxman"" = Doug Pinnick, Steve Lukather""Saw Her Standing There"" = John Corabi, CC Deville""Hey Jude"" = Ripper Owens, George Lynch""Drive My Car"" = Kip Winger, Bruce Kulick"
5,One of the better tribute CDs...,"I like this disc. It has BAWLS!!! It's refreshing to see a headbanging Beatles tribute. There has been many Beatles tribute dics. The obvious best is The Rutles, but this one is up there with it!"
4,Good covers of Beatle songs,Not all of the songs were great so I gave it a four but most are very good and it is nice to see that the Beatles wonderful music can stand up to being played in a heavier genre. Their choice of songs was appropriate for the heavy metal music.
3,One good song.,"One real good song, Back in the USSR with Lemmy. and 11 so-so songs. Worth buying just the Download instead of the whole CD."
4,BEST OF BOTH WORLDS!,"i can't believe how awesome this CD is! it is truly best of both worlds! i grew up on The Beatles(i know dam near all their songs by heart!) and i love metal (thanks to my older brother). some of the stand out tracks for me are, Billy Idol's ""Tomorrow Never Knows"",as well as ""Day Tripper"" and ""Drive my Car"".PS-ITS WORTH THE PRICE ALONE, JUST FOR THE GREAT GEOFF TATE'S TWIST ON ""LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS""!!!!!"
3,Butchered not too badly,"This is a very entertaining CD indeed. As a Billy Idol fan, I, of course, love Billy's version of ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" best. It's trippy and psychedelic just like it should be.......All the rest are respectable tributes. It's worth the purchase."
3,Need better vocals,Some of the bands used their replsacement lead vocals when they did these tracks.Most of the songs do suffer vocally.But hey they are Beatle tunes and they sound good with todays guitar riffs
4,Itzhak meets Milli Vanilli,"Yngwie Malmsteen plays the Beatles is exactly analogous to Itzhak Perlman plays Milli Vanilli. If you don't get the analogy, don't bother buying the album. If you do get the analogy, then buy the album and revel in the guitar virtuosity that can only be displayed by the incomparable Yngwie J. Malmsteen."
5,Rizzoli & Isles is fast becoming my second favorite after NCIS.,I was so pleased to see Angie Harmen in another TV series. I loved her in the Women's Murder Club and was upset when it was cancelled because of the writers strike. I also really like the actress who plays Dr. Isles - partly because I am crazy about NCIS - but I actually like her better on this series.
5,amazing!!!,"Season 1 was awesome, however, season 2 out did season 1! This show just seems to get better and better each season!"
4,The second season was better than the first!,"This is a really good show.The interaction between Jane and Maura is great to watch. They understand each other, care deeply and enjoy a tremendous friendship whilst respecting each other professionally. They are super role models.The writers have done well to produce a show with serious intent and story lines but with some great humour and pathos that makes it extremely watchable. This season we've seen the addition of an ongoing long distance love interest for Jane which has allowed us to see an extra dimension of her character.The final episode was a dousy, particularly the last scene. It will be fascinating to see how the writers manage the conflict in Season 3. I wish I didn't have to wait until later this year to watch it.If you haven't watched this show, do so. It's a delightful surprise."
4,Girl Power,"Witty, smart and in Boston! Is a good crime show that shows what amazing things women can accomplish. Totally drawn in by the first few seasons, just became a little predictable toward the end."
5,Rizzoli and Isles,"I simply love this TV show, I am deployed and can't watch it back in the states. I recommend this."
4,Recommend,"Great quality for the Kindle. I enjoyed the episode, I didn't have to wait for the tv show. I am a beginner fan of Rizzoli and Isles."
5,enjoying the reruns,I love Rizzoli and Isles and I like the deleted scenes and extras. CD arrived in good shape. Will enjoy this for several years.
5,Great Show,Rizzoli & Isles: The complete second season. It is a great show. I received the DVD within a few days. Great service!
5,Lovet this show,Love the humor and love the family Drama. Good show and both ladies crack me up. I like all the characters and how they treat each other like family.
5,Love the show,"I am a big fan of this show, wish they would expand the season, come on, everybody else has to work 48 to 50 weeks a year, why shouldn't they work at least 30?"
2,Frustrating,"I didn't realize that this was a purchase that could only be used with an internet connection. The reason I paid for this, as opposed to using less-than-honest means on the internet to stream other copies, is because I don't have an internet connection at home and wanted to be able to watch this when I got home from work. Little did I know that you cannot download the episodes you paid for unless you have a Kindle Fire. Without an internet connection, you can't watch anything. What a frustrating predicament, and of course, there are no refunds for digital purchases. I've been loyal to Amazon for years, but this really upsets me. There should be some kind of pop-up warning to tell people that you're essentially paying for the right to stream, not for the right to watch them whenever, wherever."
2,Books are better.,"The show gives too much service to the ""Rizzles."" Angie Harmon does a great job as Jane, but the Maura we know from the books has been replaced by a Dr. Brennan/Sarah Jessica Parker hybrid. In the books, Jane is a married mother, giving her a lot more depth as well as story options. Maura is in love with a priest- I can see why they would avoid that on TV, but it also flavors a lot of story.The show spends a lot of time with the girls bickering like children or playing gay. It's kind of sad. Why not just make them lovers if that's what the producers think these characters are? Gay or straight, I really hope they stop making these characters act like bimbos. In the books, they are so much more interesting.Not that anyone making the show will read this, but here's hoping."
5,Great Start,"This is a great start to a new series. Sasha and Angie are tops, I love strong women who can run the show but still have a lot of compassion when it counts the most."
5,great show. great dvds,used dvds but looked and played like new. love the show. my daughter and I cant stop watching. Happy Holidays
5,Great Series Everyone Should Watch Immediately!,Angie Harmon and Sasha Alexander shine in this wonderful series that combines crime drama and hilarious comedy. I love it and download all episodes as soon as amazon has them.
1,"""The Prince of Rags and Patches"" is incorrect","I read The Prince of Rags and Pathes a few months ago, and I enjoyed it. However, since then i have found out the truth about Richard III: he did not order Sir James Tyrell to murder his nephews, as this book suggests. I would not recommend anyone read this book, unless they want to be introduced to the widely believed but totally incorrect story. I would instead recommend ""The Daughter of Time by Josephine Tey, which answers this ""riddle"" of the Princes in the Tower. Apart from this one book, the rest of Terry Deary's books, especially his ""Horrible Histories"" series, are an entertaining and informing look at historical events. But please, do not believe this one book: while the Marsdens are fictional, so too is the plotting, murdering Richard III portrayed in it."
2,NOT THE BEST AUDIO VERSION AVAILABLE,"Although this disc states ""24-bit mastering"", it is sonically inferior to UK import released in 1999. The entire recording sounds harsh, tinny, and has no bottom-end compared to the UK disc.Also, an oddity on this disc: While I was A/B'ing the two versions, I noticed that the left & right channels on ""Autumn"" are reversed.I have two other Strawbs compilations, and the UK ""Hero & Heroine"" disc. The channels match in all three discs. So, that anamoly is another undesirable aspect of this disc.""Hero & Heroine"" is not only the best album the Strawbs ever released, it is one of the best prog-albums ever. Obviously, whoever compiled this CD agrees, because the majority of the material presented here is from that album.I would strongly urge a Strawbs neophyte to obtain H&H; and bypass this collection."
3,Somewhere Between Genesis and The Kinks!!!,"This is a good starting place for anyone who is unfamiliar with The Strawbs music. They might be best described as progressive folk/rock. I find their music to be somewhere between early Genesis and the Kinks!!! Their are some good songs on this one Lay Down, Hero and Heroine, Grace Darling, and Benedictus."
5,An unforgettable Icon of the past.,"This album is a wonderful memorial to an artist who left an indelible mark on the entertainment industry in both North America and Europe, particularly England.She presented herself in just about every entertainment form from the feeling individual (when she sang of her mother) to the comedienne, with so many of her songs, to the rather ""unorthodox"" women who gave the impression that she was the originator of ""The Facts Of Life"".For myself, I have looked for what this album presents for a number of years and to others of my generation, I know you'll treasure it just as much."
3,ok for price,"This book had a huge sticker on the front from a book store where students go. Was not real thrilled with not knowing that first, but overall ok."
