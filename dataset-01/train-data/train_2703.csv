4,Calms my nerves,I suffer from social anxiety and I will take one capsule on an empty stomach or before a meal and it seems to help calm my nerves. I don't feel as anxious or panicky when I am in social situations. For under $10 you can't beat it. I didn't have any bad side effects either. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has anxiety and can't afford xanax or other pricey prescriptions or for someone who would just prefer something natural.
5,Fibro pain,I take this for fibromayalgia pain and paresthesia which is nearly impossible to sleep through. I've also generally had trouble sleeping most of my life. I now take 2-3 before bed and sleep like a baby.
2,makes me feel lethargic and not much else,tried a whole bottle. not near as good as other similar products. it was shipped fast and in good shape. i have used other now products that i liked.
1,Tru Calm..Tru Anxiety,"I found this product for me' to give me more anxiety than calmness. I read a few reviews that were the same as mine. You have to watch out for the Niacin and inositol, also If you're weaning off benzo's valarian has an adverse reaction to it. But all bodies are different. I'm not a Doctor or Practioner just researched this info. So Good Luck everyone!!"
2,disappointing after reading great reviews,"i was hoping this could replace the xanex i have been taking for 2 years.. i took one and felt nothing, took 2, felt nothing, took 3, started feeling dizzy and nauseous. i was really disappointed. if you have pretty bad social anxiety or generalized anxiety like i do (have racing thoughts as soon as you wake up and frequent full blown panic attacks) i doubt this would work for you.. but then again, my anxiety is higher then most."
2,True Nightmare.,Contains Valerian which gives some people nightmares (me included).Did not make feel relaxed; just gave me the bad dreams.
1,Did not work for me,"I m not saying this product could work on others, it did not work for me... I did not feel any difference"
2,you get what you pay for,"I just got these pills because I have been suffering from panic attacks for a couple of days. The minute I took one, I instantly starting feeling worse. I don't feel the anxiety, but I feel kind of groggy. I would not recommend this product. There has to be something that helps with panic and anxiety attacks on the market."
2,waste of money,I will keep this short and simple. It didnt work at all. Your better off trying Lobelia or serotonin. I cant state what a waste of time this crap was. I would not make this purchase again. Im sorry to be so blunt but stress is a killer. I will try Yoga before making a random purchase like this ever again LOL!
3,only good for managing attacks,"I was hoping this would help my brain become less stressed and relax so I could think more clearly for tests and such, but no such luck. If I take it during a normal day, I don't notice any change at all, nor do I become more relaxed. However, it does seem to help a little bit on those days when I'm just stressed out and ready to punch someone in the face. If I take a capsule then, it'll being me back down to normal levels, but still not really to a 'relaxed' state of mind. If you have panic, stress, or anxiety attacks somewhat regularly, or just want to manage an occasional attack better, it's worth a shot IMO."
1,Didn't work for me,I tend to get really anxious in social situations. I was starting school soon and wanted to see if these would help calm me down a bit. They did absolutely nothing for me. It was worth the try though. It's different for everyone.
2,Ratings down!,"Starfleet is trying to get some information out of the Karemma, the same race that helped direct the Defiant to the Dominion communications relay in The Search (Part 1). The Jem'hadar get wind of this and are not impressed, attempting to destroy both the Karemma vessel and the Defiant. With the ship crippled, Sisko calls for them to head into the unstable atmosphere of a gas giant. Once in there they need to come up with a way to get home, all the while three meanacing Jem'hadar fighters are searching the gaseous atmosphere. The major characters get divided in the most hilarious circumstances that should've been serious but looked slapstick and totally scientifically inaccurate. Thinking that they're all going to die 'secrets' are revealed in the heat of the moment, nothing shocking, nothing exciting, add to that one of those ""the Captain's going to die unless we get back in 40 minutes"" stories and you have a melodramatic predictable episode."
4,Cooking,"This seems to be what i am looking for. Most people think that men can""t do anything except grill; That is not the case"
1,I cannot believe this made it to publishing,"First off, the intro was completely pretentious. The lingo seemed superfulous and fluff. The recipe for the meat loaf calls for 1/2 cup of ketchup and bread (not bread crumbs). The whole thing turned out to be a lot of slop......I was incredibly disappointed. My kids thought it was awful and we ended up eating out."
4,All purpose toolkit for ensuring there's a real cooking kitchen at dad's house,"I bought this book for my boyfriend and his young teen kids (well okay, really for me, because I collect cookbooks and was curious). Here is what is excellent about it: a TERRIFIC single page chart so the cooking-impaired can look in their fridge and freezer and tell what is ""old and should be tossed immediately food,"" and easy to read recipes for basics that everyone universally likes to eat and can actually make, such as grilled cheese sandwiches, pancakes, etc. The only thing I wished for more of: photos of finished dishes, but I realize this would have increased the price of the book...and, who but cookbook collectors really need to view a finished grilled cheese sandwich anyway? More than worth the purchase if you're trying to class up a dad's kitchen in a gentle, good humored way."
5,"GREAT, event for a more experienced cook!","I've owned this book for more than 10 years. When I first got it, it was perfect for my VERY limited cooking skills. Now, I'm a much more confident cook, and I've got a huge library of great cookbooks. However, whenever I need basic information (how long to boil or steam a vegetable, what temperature to use for baking different fishes, how to make a good rice pilaf), I reach for this book and know I'll find a straightforward answer that produces great results."
5,Simply the best,I took this Nikon 200mm micro lens to Desert Botanic Garden two days after I received. The pictures taken with this lens are absolutely beautiful.
4,The cats like it-- it is very good for Big Bad Baby Twinkle's,"delicate stomach.It smells good and fresh -- I only wish it was a LITTLE bit juicier - however I make up for that by adding a little water to it when I serve it to my kitties.The veggies are soft and edible -- I would like to see the flax seeds ground up a little -- but they have not caused anyone any digestive distress, and they are a welcome addition to roughage in the mix."
3,Special forces ring,Yes it looks good but this one i purchased lost it shine as it may have been a manufacturing default
1,Kinked and then broke on 2nd use,"It is very difficult to feed this snake with a power drill without a very low setting past a drain cross bar. If it doesn't cross, it immediately coils and folds in on itself and kinks. Once it kinks, as other reviewers said, it's trash. It can no longer coil properly and it won't work. Seem like there are much better products out there that I will now try."
1,was broken in the box,This was defective the minute I took it out of the box. We needed something right away & I did not sent it back to Amazon because of the time & hassle. We found smething else at our local hardware store.
1,"Great idea, but does not work well",I bought two of these expecting problems and hopeing at least to get the job done. The first one broke down in the first attempt to use it. I learned by my mistake of using it and tried the second one. I got the job half way done when the second one broke. I called a plumber like I should have from the beginning. JB
1,worthless,"As other reviewers have noted, this snake is very low quality and difficult to use. It kinks very easily and once kinked is worthless. Do not buy - it won't solve your problem."
3,"Good cd, but not totally my style.....","I love Raffi's simple melodies and happy tunes. I know my daughter will enjoy him for years to come. My favorite song on this cd is ""All I Really Need"". It is such a pretty song and can actually bring a tear to me eye, LOL! The song speak's of a family's love and it is very sweet.That said, Raffi is too much of a tree hugger for me. He is very much into saving the earth and while I agree we should all do what we can to take care of the earth, he goes a bit over board.For example, the song titled ""Clean Rain. He sings a verse in there about ""how the rain used to fall clean"". Well, as far as I know, it still falls clean, LOL! What's that all about?? God is the maker of rain and if it meet's his standards, it sure as heck meets mine!All in all, it is a sweet cd, but with a heavy ""save the earth"" undertone."
1,Beyond bad,"Does Peter Coyote desperately need money? Made side by side with Return of the Living 4: Necropolis for the Sci-Fi Channel, Return of the Living Dead 5: Rave to the Grave makes the aforementioned film look like Casablanca. The surviving teens from the last film are here again, now in college, and apparently they have no memory of the events that took place bcause they look shocked when they first see the undead, and make some just plain dumb decisions in the process. Whatever the reason behind the direction of the story, said story revolves around another cannister found, and a few kids making a rave drug out of it called, you guessed it, Z. There's some funny moments here and there, but everything about the film is so bad (from the acting, the story, and the makeup effects) that you'll be in hysterics. The tarman, the iconic zombie from the classic 1985 original, makes an appearance too, but it's far too brief to warrant any merit in watching this drek."
4,"To all you ""Movie Critics"" on here...","Any ""true fan"" of this series should at least like this movie! I saw the original at the theater back in the day, and have loved it ever since. I participated in the dvd campaign to bring the original to DVD. Rave to the Grave is almost as fun as any in the series(way better than necropolis). I wish that any one who dislikes this movie and gives it a bad rap on here, or anywhere else, would step up to the plate and make something better!!! My two cents worth!!!"
1,I don't know how to explain this much suck....,"This is just pathetic...Uwe Boll makes a better zombie film...really...They need to let this franchise die or find Russo & let him save it...But, it's probably too late - the cancer that is parts 4 & 5 has spread...This makes part 3 look like high art...I love zombie films more than any kind of horror..I own more than most people know exist...I don't say this to soud like a know it all but this movie is just embarrasing...You can cover dog poo in powdered sugar & call it candy, but this movie coated dog poo with more dog poo & called it candy..."
4,These Raver Brains Taste Trippy,"I actually like this one, after several weak links in the Return of the Living Dead series, this is my favorite since the first two. A student chemist gets a hold of one of the living dead containment drums and sells the zombie serum all over campus as a psychedelic drug just in time for the big halloween rave, lots of blood and gore, lots of zombie action, story and movie move quick, right fun flick."
5,Return of the Living Dead: Rave to the Grave,"This is a great movie to watch it has some funny parts to it, but if you like zombie movies this is a great one to own or to watch."
3,Rave 2 the grave,If your a zombie flick fan this is likely the weakest in the series however worth renting.
2,Dead DVD,"I liked Dead 5 better than 4, but that isn't saying much. At least it isn't filmed in total darkness. Both 4 and 5 have lead sound tracks that weigh down the film. Music, dubbing, and incidental music. A little work on the bad music, the film would have been better. If you turn off the sound and watch it like a TV in a bar the film becomes better. I found Dead 5 to have it's moments, it isn't as bad as some of the reviewers said. They were trying, but didn't make it. I don't think the script was as bad as they make out either. If I was a teacher I would give it a C+. If it had better music a B. It was and sounds like a European made film."
2,PURE CRAP ........... SIMPLE AS THAT,"Parte 5 of return of the living dead is an offense to the name of this franchise one of the BEST ZOMBIE franchise zombie movies i have EVER seen with a good dose of terror and humor.This part is even worse than the last part , part 4 ""necropolis"" , lot's of plot holes , bad actors ,bad script, simple terrible.Unlike some reviewrs said it's NOT worse than house of the dead * nothing is * but get pretty close ."
1,See backwards,"This is the worst of all Return of the Living Dead series. If you want to know with one is the best, just see backwards n 5: the worst (unwatchable), n 4: bad (too bad), n 3: suddenly the living dead does not eat just brains, they changed the rules of the original, I hate it. n 2: good movie and finally the cult classic: Return of the Living Dead. To me there's only the original and the part 2. The rest is dead."
5,abiyoyo,"Chrildren at my nursery school beg to hear this book over and over,I also love it and readily comply. We have the audio recording by Pete Seegar to accompany this story, he is a joy to listen to."
5,classic for kids from 2 to 95,"Abiyoyo is an exciting legend woven of gorgeous illustrations, a memorable tune, charming details and a little nudge of morality tale. Pete Seeger explains what ""ostracized"" means--they made 'em live on the edge of town. His lovable outcasts save the village from the dangerous but gullible giant and are taken back into the fold. A wonderful, wonderful book."
4,Great Book,"My kids love this book, But I thought the CD was going to be telling the story of the book, not just the song."
5,MAGICAL effect,"Got this book from a used book store when our kid was 2 years old. It's had a magical effect on her even today, a year later. She has imitated the Abiyoyo character, begs me to make up Abiyoyo stories, tells me he's her friend, etc. We've read it at least 200 times. The monster is a real, significant presence in our daughter's life.Perhaps because its phrasing comes from a song, the lines are memorable. Our child has memorized whole pages, and ""sings"" along when we read it to her. There's not a single word that can be deleted, it's that finely edited.Definitely in the top 10 in our library."
4,Good,The book was received in a timely manner. It took about a week for me to receive it after placing my order. The book was in new condition. I would definitely order from this seller again.
1,Damaged Product - Sellers are CROOKS,"I got this camera for a photography class at my college. I'm a poor student with a single mother and I worked hard to save the money for the camera, but when I received it from the seller Greatvalue, it was broken. I sent it back and also I definitively used the correct address when sending it back they claim they never got the camera. They also refuse to give me a refund despite having contacted them for a refund before the guarantee had expired. I've contacted both Amazon and Greatvalue multiple times about this issue and had received absolutely zero cooperation or support. I've been abused and ignored and I'm out over $230. I will never buy from Greatvalue or Amazon again.As for the camera itself, I have since found out that these camera jam easily. I loved the camera other than the fact that it was unusable because it jammed when reloading the film constantly because it was broken when I got it. This camera may not be your best bet."
4,Nikon FM10,"The Nikon FM10 is among last of 35mm film cameras, along with the high end FM6. This camera is well suited to learn film photography. The camera though is not actually made by Nikon; but by Cosina. Cosina is a Japanese camera company, but the FM10 is actually built in China. This allows the FM10 to be affordable for student use. The rugged, use it forever built Japanese Nikon chassis is not with this camera. The included lens is also a Cosina built lens even though it carries the Nikor brand. So, the FM10 is adequate to use to learn techniques on, but is not the enduring camera to take rough field use. You must acquire the true Nikon FM2, which is discontinued."
5,No Problems Here,"The FM-10 works very well for what it is. This camera does not offer a large amount of features, but that's why I purchased it. It does allow for manual control of shots which is exactly what I was looking for. I have had no issues with light leaks or durability. Shutter speed is decent. The lens works, but I would recommend purchasing additional lenses for variable uses. Overall it is simple to use and was a good purchase."
4,A good overview,"I prefer the ""Private Money"" equity lending book reveiwed previously, but this one turned out to be informative too. I had originally cancelled my order, but got it anyway. Good information on originating and purchasing real estate notes (discount notes from lenders/banks), and great if you are looking to find an alternative to the stock/bond market funds that most people have their IRAs invested in."
5,Taking Control of Your Retirement,"As someone who was hit particularly hard financially from the fallout from the Enron debacle, I've been actively seeking alternative methods to protect future wealth. This book provides a straight forward and practical guide providing insight into a viable option that most people never hear about. I particularly liked the easy reading style, as well as the thorough presentation of the material. Resources are carefully documented, adding credibility. The information is presented so that someone like me--whose only real estate investment to date has been my personal home--has enough information after reading this book to undertake this investment strategy. I've given out five copies to family and friends who also have interest in investing in real estate, but felt it was not going to be financially possible. To the writers, kudos!"
1,The Man of Steel' girlfriend never looked worse!,Quite simply not worth the space this review would take up. And can someone stop this Adrian character writing those aweful Margot Kidder reviews.
2,Flashback,"This episode is very similar to Necessary Evil, which was just as rubbish. Dax, Odo, Sisko and Garak are all found unconscious and rushed to sickbay only to find they are in some strange coma. Though Sisko and co are infact in sickbay they all believe they are onbaord Terok Nor and a strange murder investigation goes underway in a slow, unrevealing and scientific flawed episode.Terrible. Even Andrew Robinson aka Garak couldn't lift this one!"
4,Mexican Horror Classics,"I ordered both Vacaciones de Terror 1 and 2, but the distributers did not include on the box from the part 2 that it includes both ver5sions, so now I have one extra part 1, thank god I ordered them from the same seller, so I did not pay two shipments, but it's ok it was enterprises' matter not seller's mistake.Even though I am happy I received them on time and good shape (One box was broken but not from seller but from factory, so they are brand new).But I recommend these movies, they're just great!"
2,Decent enough... I guess,"This is an expensive book, at $70, and should provide much greater detail than it does. Hundreds of important regional breweries are not mentioned. The American distillery industry is also short slighted. The book makes no attempt to compile a ""picture"" of the brewing or hard liquor industries at any particular point in history. Nor does it provide any insight into the operational behaviors of any of the breweries or distilleries."
4,Jadzia and her ex-wife,Jadzia Dax chooses between her feelings and the rules of Trill society when she is reunited with the wife of one of Dax's previous hosts. So must her ex-wfe.
2,Is there a crime behind this fortune?,"David Bendah wrote and sold many different ""get rich quick"" books. He sold many using different names in Income Opportunities magazine where he also advertised ""wild scent will drive women crazy"" and ""free government money"" and others. His advice and own actions cost him his freedom. After pleading guilty to various counts of mail and postal fraud, David is serving several years in prison. He's no millionaire anymore but a broke felon. Be careful of the methods and advice in these books. You can't always legally make easy riches. Of course if you insist on Mr. Bendahs advice, you can reach him c/o the Federal Correctional Institution at Lompoc."
5,Your First Step To Financial Freedom Begins With This Book!,Would you like to fire your boss and throw away your alarm clock and wake up naturally for the rest of your life? It begins with this book. This was the first book I ever bought on marketing information products by mail. I was 19 and had never read a whole book in my entire life. I read this entire book NON-STOP in 12 hours. It changed my life forever! For years now I have been self-employed and love it. I am very grateful to David Bendah and many of his books for helping me achieve my freedom! You will not be disappointed with this book...
4,Truly step-by-step guide,"The book provides reader with step-by-step information on how to succeed in your home-based mail order business. A very thorough, detailed manual that can make you financially independent."
1,"Beware, check the fit","Be warned, this teleconverter does not fit all Nikon lenses. Read the specifications on Nikon's site before purchasing this teleconverter. I was disappointed to find out only a few lenses will fit this teleconverter. Nikon has added a small piece of metal to block use of other lenses.I wish Nikon would allow other lenses to fit this teleconverter. They claim that the elements will touch. If that is so, then all they need to do is make this teleconverter slightly larger to fit without elements touching.It would have made a great edition to any lens collection."
2,Baby buddy harness,It looks and sounds like it would work. Quality ok. Just one thing the grandchildren didn't like it at all. So needless to say I have never tryed it again. Not for my family.
2,Cheap,These are cheaply made. They tangle easily and seem to be a poor product overall. I wish I would not have purchased them.
3,HARNESS,Bought two for twin granddaughters. One twin did not mind the harness but the other one would have nothing to do with it...that's just her personality (very independent).
2,Conspiracy theory!,"This was the first episode of the terrible season five of Deep Space Nine which featured Sisko, O'Brien and Odo dressed up as Klingon's and trying to infiltrate the Klingon homeworld (does this remind you of the Next Gen episdoe Reunification or what?) and expose Gowron as a Changeling. The plot is slow and clumsy, and although the ending is revealing this is not what you come to expect from a season opener. No action. Everone goes home happy but a pointless war between the Klingon's and Starfleet still remains at the end of it the simple question is WHY? Hell Sisko and crew practically save the Klingon Empire in this episode but nothing comes out of it. Any way, terrible, buy Way of the Warrior or Call to Arms!"
5,BB is always at his Best with his friends,"B.B. King gets no better than when he performs with the people he genuinely loves. This CD was my adult re-education in the Blues and I could not have done better. Whether it's Saturday morning baking or Sunday morning watering of the plants, I can't get it done without being on the Summit with B. B. and his great friends, Koko Taylor, Etta James and John Lee Hooker. This is the music that you makes you so deeply happy that you love music. It makes me love my friends as well. At the age of 4, my Granddaughter has made B. B. one of her friends and I will never worry that along with all the other genres she will always include Blues having fallen in love with B. B. and his Friends. This CD provides the juice for my personal cabaret."
4,Nobody loves me but my mother...,"...and I think she might be jivin' me too.Now, THAT is when you got the Blues! And yes, that song is on this album.These are duets that B.B. has done with some of the other greatest names in Blues: Buddy Guy, John Lee Hooker, Etta James, Koko Taylor... oh heck, just go read the album cover.Every song on this album is a classic, and I listen to it over and over.Buy it, you won't regret it. Especially when you get so low... SO low... that you think that even your mother is jivin' you when she says she loves you."
5,duets,"B.B. King has evolved over the years from a high power, blow you away blues man to a senior statesman of the blues, who enjoys making his music and working with other artists. His duets have become some of his finest work. I love this album because he still has the fire power and plays off his partners in a way that makes their talents even bigger. His enjoyment comes through very clearly, particularly in the asides with performers like Ruth Brown. Listening to this album always gets me pumped up."
2,So - so,"Hi, I bought this DVD, hoping that there would be some practical explanation of buddhist principles given by the Dalai Lama. However, it is a documentary (and it is a good documentary) about buddhism in general. The point that annoys me about this product is that ""Dalai Lama"" is written all over it, yet he only makes a short appearance in the 300 minutes of film."
2,"High price, low quality","Unfortunately slip-ons are no longer beeing sold by Longs or Walgreens so one depends (pun intended) on Internet sales. his product is of por quality, low absorbency and high price but .... is one of the few available slip-on underwears."
3,EXCELLENT VALUE FOR THE $,"For the price, these are the best value in adult diapers on the market. The absorbent padding is adequate. My only complaint is the sides are flimsy, easy to tear if you pull too hard. Also, the fitting tabs are small but I haven't had any problem with them coming loose. The elastic around the legs fits snugly without causing irritation.AMAZON has the best price. With SUBSCRIBE & SAVE, I get an additional 15% off their already low price & free delivery to my door. Can't beat it."
3,Not for people who move around.,"I bought these for my elderly parents who still get around a bit, but need some extra help at night. They usually get another brand but I was trying to save them some money because the price was good on Amazon. But, they had a lot of difficulty with the tabs, getting them to stay fixed -- they kept coming apart whenever they would turn over in bed, or get up at night. I don't know about the absorbency since they never tried them again."
5,Worth every penny!,"The staff at the nursing home have nothing but good things to say about these briefs. They are absorbent and the closure tape can easily be opened and closed again. We have seen a significant decrease in the number of briefs being used since we switched to Per-Fit, and you can't beat the scheduled monthly delivery from Amazon."
4,Adult Diapers,My spouse is in a nursing home due to ALZ. The nursing home charges $7 per day for incontinence supplies. The Per-Fit briefs are the identical product that the nursing home uses at a cost of less than $2.50 per day for me instead of $7. The CNA's and I am very pleased with the performance of the product and my cost savings. I previously had tried 4 other products that did not give the performance of this product.
3,cost of this item,"I have been getting this item with my subscribe and save account for over a year. All of a sudden this item has doubled in price. What is up with that? Couldn't find another way on Amazon to ask this question other than calling, and I have found that choice to be most unhelpful."
3,A ok episode,Worfs brother kurn arrives on ds9 after gowrons forces took worfs land and removed his brother from the high councel Kurn wants nothing bt to die because a klingon without a house has no status in the empire eventually worf has his brothers memory removed so he will nolonger feel the dishonor he carries inside him
4,Must have.,"Satyricon was always placed amongst ""emperor,Mayhem,Immotal""in the ranks of the Black metal elite,and for good reason.Back in the early 90s they released this little number known as dark Medieval Times.What does it sound like?Exactly what its titled as.Its dark,its atmospheric and satyr can actually play guitar.The production is poor and really adds to the atmosphere of the album giving it a feel of misty black forests.Its a shame they followed the same path as dimmu(Except that dimmu still make decent music and didnt tour with slipknot)because they would have gone down alongside Mayhem and bathory as pioneers."
1,Do not get this!!,"The customer support is very poor. The screen resolution is not good, if you wear glasses. We could never get the test application to work. For the price, it is not worth the time!"
2,Not worth it.,"I bought this several years ago and found that I needed an nVidia card. Okay so I went to a computer store and bought one installed it and so-forth. It worked. Yea!!! Then a few weeks later I upgraded the drivers. It didn't work after that. It turns out that nVidia stopped supporting their stereoscopic drivers and the only way to continue to use this product is to continue to use the old ones. Well, I have a new computer with an ATI card and I was told that I could put a chip in for about $29 into the visor and it will work with it... just not in 3D.So, it is dependent on other hardware and software that is outdated. My recommendation is to keep looking around."
1,"Hardware OK, Software not so much","Decent hardware, but making it work is a pain. The software is amateurish and clumsy at best. Support recommended a third party driver for additional $$. That helped a little, but it is hampered by overly complex, paranoid copy protection. It's a shame really because IF you manage to get it going, it works quite well. Overall though, quite sorry I bought it. Purchased from Virtual Realities (via Amazon) who said I could NOT return it. I'll either sell it on eBay or see if it blends."
5,Great soundtrack!,"I got this CD for the song ""Ready For A Miracle"" bu Patti LaBelle.....I can't find it anywhere by itself. I have to say, the whole cd is good! Where else can you get Patti, Don Henley, Wynonna and Lyle Lovett together? I love the movie so the soundtrack always takes me back."
4,You'll find your faith again.....,"The movie was outstanding, the soundtrack just as good. Steve Martin stars as a burned-out charlatan evangelist who comes to a town that hasn't had rain in a long time. Martin finds his own faith throught the course of the plot. You'll find yours just listening to the soundtrack. The CD opens up with Don Henley's ""You better sit down"" which surprisingly made the charts. Patti Labelle and Edwin Hawkin's ""Are you ready for a Miracle"" was probably the most stunning piece of the whole album, but all the music is upbeat and heartening. One minus was the instrumental music was not included."
5,best thing I've heard in 20 years,As a christian and as a musician there has never been an album or a movie so loaded with energy. This album proves that men are to move!
5,THE BEST OF TWO WORLDS,"Yofiyah is the best of two worlds. The first world is her instrumental orchestration. I love her combination of middle eastern dialect with the musical instruments of India. The other world is in her lyrics,Hebrew and English. Although I have enjoyed Sanshrit lyrics, Yofiyah have given me a native language with a cultural melody that I can ethnically identify with.This CD is played for my morning meditation. It immediately brings a joyful encouragement for the day that is ahead of me.In fact, her octave levels has reminded of that of Tim Buckley, a legend in his own musical innovation in the 70's. Is possible that Yofiyah is his reincarnation?Shalom"
1,RIP OFF!!,"Vendor states this is replacement for Lynx grill.The package only contains sixty briquettes, the grill requires seventy. So buy two packages, double the price and find something to use the remaining fifty on. RIP OFF!!"
4,great beginning camera,"i am just now taking an intro film photo class so i am by far an expert on cameras and their quality. but from a beginners point of view i really like this camera. my only qualm with it so far is that due to the fact that i will be taking a TON of pictures i decided to buy film in bulk and load it into the cassettes myself. the only down side to this is that because the camera automatically uses the DX strip to tell the ISO for the film it does not have a manual override option. i believe that if no DX is detected it automatically assumes ISO 400, however, if i decide to use anything else than that will require me to go out and buy DX coding strips and change them every time i change film speeds. nothing too terrible, or unsolvable, but it still sucks!! oh well. otherwise, great camera for a beginner."
3,misleading,"The seller mislead consumer's into believing this camera ""kit"" included the lens. It was pictured with the lens and the item description also read with 28-80mm Nikon AF Lens. This was upsetting beyond words as it the item purchase was to be a Christmas gift to my daughter. Nonetheless, the actual product could be working OR NOT, who knows. I wouldn't trust this seller."
4,"Well versed, general history of viruses with probing issues","Whilst this book is written by a 'writer' and not a scientist, her knowledge of the area is extensive, and she presents an addictive presentation of an area those of us know well. The use of 'interdisciplinary' insight (see p18), is an inspiration to any one working in ANY field. The presentation draws one in like a magnetic force, with a roller coaster of emotion and thought involved. A good read for those with a knowledge of the history of viruses but not their pure scientific background, but would leave those without, pondering far too much."
2,A non-scientists view of emerging viruses,"As a regular science reader I found myself cringing at some of the 'facts' proposed by Ms.Henig. Several of them are more sterotype or rumour rather than fact. I agree with another reviewer who accuses the authour of cliche.At one point she refers to disease as an ""inconclusive negotiation for symbiosis, an over-stepping of the line by one side or the other, a biologic misinterpretation of borders.""All biology students should be wiping tears from their eyes at this point. Natural selection has no foresight. Viruses have evolved to survive (as have we). They are not attempting to live in peace and harmony with us anymore than we are trying to live in peace and harmony with them. If a virus can pass 1000 progeny to the next generation whilst being very virulent, or 100 progeny whilst being mildly virulent, it will evolve towards higher virulence.There are some ok parts, but quite un-scientific and frustrating in parts."
3,Not well written but interesting,"The subject matter of this book sparkles though some mediocre writing. The book is not well organized and the author is fond of cliches such as ""Professor Morse has a small office typical of college professors, crammed with books and old coffee mugs."" Who cares! If the author had just focused on virulogy, it would have been better, but it is still an interesting read (though a bit dated now)."
3,"Good overview of emerging viruses, but a bit dated","Overall I recommend this book, especially if you are just beginning to learn about virusus. A lot of specific details have changed since this book was published. For example, the chapter on AIDS, while being accurate in 1994, is now so out of date as to be somewhat offensive. However, the main point of the book, that humans are behaving in ways that greatly increase the risk of viral epidemics, is not at all dated. In fact, it is more relevant now than ever. Despite some details being out of date, the concepts presented in this book are accurate, and VERY, VERY important. However, if you are looking for specifics on emerging viruses, I would recommend reading a more current book. If you have a scientific background and want more details, I also recommend ""The Coming Plague"" by Laurie Garrett. Like this book, it has some inaccuracies, but I found it more interesting."
5,Anatomy & Physiology Basics,"In its most simplistic form, Rizzo defines the human body and functions with great illustrations. A basic necessity for anyone entering the healthcare industry. An excellent beginners book for those seeking a HIT career!"
5,Recommended Book,"I appreciate how Donald Rizzo explains the assortment of topics in his book. At first I considered I would be turned off to all the information to learn. I found how he explained cephalad, caudal, medial and lateral with much clearness. The examples of how to use each one was uncomplicated to learn from. The Integumentary System and Nervous System chapters were complex to a degree. This subject is not as easy as intro to biology. This book ranks high in my mind. Other recommendations.....Anatomy and Physiology Study Guide:Key Review Questions and Answers by Patrick LeonardiAnatomy and Physiology(Flash Cards) by Alcamo Edward, isbn 1878576151"
2,Somewhat interesting,"This was a somewhat interesting book detailing and describing the changes and methods employed for Evangelism in America. A historical book that does a fairly good job of providing an overall picture from the town-to-town evangelists, Methodism, television and radio evangelists such as Oral Roberts, and the pinnacle of modern evangelism, Rev. Billy Graham. Explores some of the successes and problems associated with different methods and then points to some of the current methods employed such as Evangelism Explosion, Campus Crusade, etc.This is not a ""how to"" book on evangelism, but rather a who, when, where and why book."
2,Analyses,"In the section 'Rationale for this Book': ""These essays adress: Why are experts now saying EI exists? What is the concept and what does it mean? Why does..."" Although there is a part with the title ""Applications of EI..."", this book contains only definitions, relationships between definitions and analyses.I did not find anything in this book that I could apply to improve my EI. Although the title of the 10th chapter is ""Applied EI..."" it is just a short section about consequences, effects on health, a summary and a concrete small example. My key point would have been this: ""Learn to Regulate Our Emotions for Better Health"", but it is one page long. Probably I misunderstood the title and the description."
5,excellent binoculars,Very nice image. I can look for long time periods without eye fatigue and the clarity is excellent.
5,Very useful,My husband says these are the best ever! Every time he uses them he says the same thing! He says the clarity is amazing.
3,"Serious ""Birder""on a budget","I am passionate about ornithology,but being a musician i dont have a large budget.I read the 5 star reviews on Amazon,so i thought ""go for it"".The price was right.These binos have excellent image quality at short to middle distances and will serve you very well but where they fall short is thets say you spot a white bird beyond 1/2 a mile, there is a faint pink tinge around the bird at these greater distances,weird but true.It is the same with white buildings as well.They are light.The focus ring is quick and precise and the build quality is good.The protective plastic eyepieces are crap(after 3hrs use they broke !!!!!!!!.)Summery.If your looking for good low price binos,they will do the job,but you get what you pay for.If you are serious about your hobby you will need to pay more."
5,Nikon Binocular reveiw,"We purchased the Nikon Monarch 10x42 for a cruise to Alaska and it was suggested we get waterproof, fogproof. I thought the binoculars were a little larger than i wanted to be carrying around for a walking tour but they proved to be no problem..the neck strap was quite comfortable to wear. The magnification was better than anticipated. It ended up we didnt need waterproof on this trip, but just the fact they are shockproof is a great asset as well."
4,Great mid-range binocs,"I have really enjoyed these binoculars. We were looking for a good pair for watching the wildlife near our house (not the neighbors). We also wanted a set that was compact enough we could take to theater events if we had cheaper seats. The Nikon Monarchs serve both purposes very well.The clarity is super close to the much more expensive models and the feel of the binocs and the adjustments are really nice.Great choice. I dropped a star only because the Amazon price was higher than the price at a local Omah, NE store.Update -- I recently took my binocs to a Joshua Bell concert and can attest these glasses work very well in low light / theater light."
5,Perfect for the average hunter!,"I love these Binoculars! I bought these binos to use while hunting and at the occasional sporting event or concert I get attend. Like many working people, I only get to hunt a few times days during the season. I was looking for a nice set of binos that had great features (waterproof, fogproof, etc.) without spending ridiculous money like the pros do. I read many reviews and decided on the Monarch ATB's. I love them! For the money you will not beat them. They are clear, have great light transmission, adjust easily, and are perfect size. Like others have said the lens covers pop off a little too easily but nothing that a little doctoring won't take care of. I looked through my buddies $1100 binos and there is very little difference. I laughed at him after he looked through these. I think he was a little sick when he found out how much I paid compared to the amout he paid.I would buy these again in a heartbeat. Great purchase!!"
5,10 x 42 Nikon Monarch ATB,"Very pleased with these binoculars - extremely nice for the price. Shopped long and hard for a pair that was under the 1,000 dollar price tag yet had the qualities of the upper end types. These are the ones!!"
2,Poor optics,"After much research, I ordered this Monarch 10x42 and got it today. After 15 minutes of evaluation, I shipped it back. The optics were really not what I expected from Nikon and for $250+ I paid for. As soon as I opened the package, I took it out - it was bright and sunny. I focused on the tree twigs with sunlight coming in from the back. I saw a purple halo on one side and yellow-orange on the other. The chromatic aberration was awful. I had my '91 Bushnell Powerview 7x35 for comparison - it faired far far better than this Nikon! I am sticking with my cheap Bushnell for my birding at least for now."
5,NIKON 7432 BINOCULARS - AWESOME!!!!!,"ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC BINOCULARS. SUPER CRISP VIEWS, ONE HAND OPERATION (AT LEAST FOR ME),WELL WORTH THE MONEY. CAN'T SAY ENOUGH PRAISES ABOUT THEM. WENT TO ALASKA CRUISE FOR 7 DAYS - TRIP WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS SPECTACULAR WITHOUT THEM."
5,birdsupclose,"We have a couple of Nikon's smaller (travel) binoculars which are great for what they're designed to do, but this one is a major leap above and beyond those. Nikon has packed an incredible amount of quality into this product, yet kept it compact and light enough for easy transporting. Amazon had it priced at $255, and it's hard to imagine that you can buy much improvement in quality (at least for the recreational user)by spending a lot more."
4,Just the basic's,"This is a solid bag so far, but dont expect much other than that it holds 10-15 discs, with front mesh holding maybe 2 disc's. the zipper pocket i put my mini, cell phone, and keys, maybe a wallet can go there aswell. The drink holder at most will fit a 20oz bottle. The strap is just a simple nylon strap, no padding. The cover zips all the way around your disc's and it is rollable and secured by a simple velcro (sp?) strap aswell. Back to the strap, it is adjustable and the length is good when fully adjusted. one thing that was mentioned was a towel ring i couldn't find one. other than that this is a great starter bag, and i can see for the minimalist who doesn't like to carry 30-40 discs in a bag.Only reason I'm giving 4 out of 5 stars is the shoulder strap has no pad and description said towel ring and there isn't one.This is a great bag if your a beginner i suggest to get it, you wont be sorry."
1,Damages,There was a dried flower inside the book that let dark stains on many pages.I returned the book last week. Regards
2,Chin strap problems,"I purchased the helmet because of price and general reputation and the advice of a friend with a helmet of the same brand. This helmet, however, has positioned the safety chin straps where they intersect the rear inside of the helmet in such a way that they bunch up and poke the back of your head. We put extra cushioning there, which helps, but should not be needed. Our Trek helmet is much more comfortable."
4,A good buy,"A comfy and economical helmet that fits surprisingly well. Only flaw I'd say is the weird angle of the side straps. Nevertheless, a great deal for a sub-$30 helmet."
3,universal fit nevertheless slightly small...,i'm an asian with average build and head size. however the helmet was slightly small/tight on the sides. nevertheless still acceptable.
3,helmet,"recieved helmet quick, however the padding is less than desired, also no instructions as to how to add extra padding as to where it should be placed inside helmet. fit and comfort are good. if your head is big i would not recommend this helmet. i also own a schwinn helmet that is made for bigger heads."
5,Great helment,Bought 2 helments. Both my wife and I are very pleased with the fit and comfort of the helment. Style and vents are just what we wanted.
2,Mushroom Alert,"I bought this helmet after trawling helmet reviews for comments that the helmet was low-profile. This one's not, it's one of the most mushroomy helmets I've had on my head, and I tried it on a couple of people who normally look great in bike helmets just to make sure it wasn't me. If, like me, you are here looking for an inexpensive AND good-looking helmet, move along."
4,"Good helmet, though not the best looking.","One of the things I really like about this helmet is that the straps fit really well. Many of the helmets I have used in the past had straps that would move around and really bug me, but this one has straps twisted in a way that they fit comfortably.I don't really love the look of the helmet. The size and placement of the vents make it look more like a cheap helmet than a Giro, but it is a pretty cheap helmet, so I guess that is to be expected."
3,Giro cycling helmet,"This helmet was bought for my seven year old, one size and it fit well. Beautiful shape and style just as advertised. Only fault the straps twist by the ears, that's why I gave 3 stars however would still recommend."
5,A good buy for a really good helmet,"I have really stepped up my cycling this year. I enjoy 50+ mile trips on the local bike trails and ride my bike to work a couple days a week, 12 miles each way.I bought this helmet as a replacement for one that I cracked in an accident a couple of weeks ago. I hope I never find out if keeps my head as safe as my previous one did, just a mild concussion. It is very comfortable and fits me well.I read the reviews about the straps not lying flat and was concerned about them. After making the proper adjustment for fit, I hardly notice them. It has better air flow than my old helmet.I definitely like this helmet and recommend this it, especially for the price."
3,bike helmet,"good brand, cheap helmet.my experience: often disappointed with amazing bargains on Amazon. (on the whole, i love amazon, and typically, great value for great products. but when i've bought things that are so cheap it seems to good to be true, it often is.)"
3,Good Buy,"The giro transfer is a rather sport or recreational helmet, it has vents that keeps you head cool, and i think is a nice helmet for the price. I have been using it for 2 seasons and cant find any fault with it, i never crashed with it to test durability."
4,Does the job,It's a bike helmet...it does the job! the dial fit mechanism on the back works well. The straps adjust nicely and if you're wearing a hat underneath there is a bit of room to make it bigger to allow for the thickness of the hat. (a thin hat).
5,Great Helmet,Great helmet for the price. This is my first helmet and in my opinion it is really comfortable and durable.
3,A ER intern's review,"As a 1st year ER resident, I picked this book up to supplement my knowledge on basic musculoskeletal and orthopedic injuries. The text does a wonderful job of illustrating proper physical exam skills, as well as covering a broad range of injuries commonly found in the ED. The specific topics are concise and in depth in terms of diagnosing musculoskeletal conditions. However, I felt the general orthopedics section didn't contain any new information that a fourth year medical student hasn't already covered at some point. And I was somewhat disappointed in the treatment and red flag sections on each condition, as I felt they were much too brief. That being said, I was happy with my purchase and have learned a great deal in diagnosing the various MSK conditions found in the ED, while supplementing treatment options with other texts."
1,KINDLE EDITION IS WEAK,"While this text is an excellent resource for the primary care physician, the kindle edition is terrible. There is no links or available table of contents, and extremely difficult to find a specific chapter as there is no guidence as to where it exists. I will change my review when a TOC is added (come on, this is a basic function of an e-book)."
5,Essentials of Musculoskeletal Care,Excellent resource! A must have to treat the most common injuries or conditions. This book is an excellent resource to use in clinicals. I highly recommend this book be part of your library.
5,Great resource for family practice,I am a recent graduate from a family practice residency. I used this book in residency and ordered one soon thereafter to use in my own practice. The patient exercise handouts on the CD are excellent.
2,need more detail,I bought this book thinking it would be a more specicfic musculoskeletal companion to Braddom's generalized PM&R textbook. Unfortunately the treatment paragraphs (most important section from my perspective) for each topic were very thin and nonspecific. They were woefully inadequate for an attending or physiatry resident. I sent the book back which unfortunately meant I didn't get to critique the DVD.
2,Just a basic question guide,This is an OK resource for basic questions and easy vocabulary. There is much harder vocabulary in the book itself and so much more inferential material to draw upon.
2,Good but NOT the originals,"It's a very good work with one major exception: These are re-releases! I was a country DJ during much of the time she released these tunes, and after hundreds of spins (yes, her Warner Brothers material was on vinyl) I know the sound to this day. If you remember the exact sound from the originals and expect that from this album, you'll be disappointed. Radio stations and purists whom are after the originals should skip this album."
3,"Helpful, but written in irritating style","The most useful aspect of Dann Hazel's book is his many individual testimonies. I am trying to deal with a long-term relationship that has suddenly turned very long-distance. I found the testimonies he recounts very helpful in giving a sense of the endless variety of arrangements and issues that couples deal with. This widened my ideas of what's possible and acceptable. His sections on dealing with being alone have helped me deal with suddenly living alone, while my partner is in another country for a year. But I found his exercises after each chapter superficial, and his habit of always talking in terms of ""we"", rather than ""I"", ""you,"" or ""they,"" as appropriate became so irritating I almost didn't read the book."
1,The French Country Garden Louisa Jones,"I am a gardener and garden writer. I was looking for inspiration for design elements, for planting interest and I found almost nothing. The photographs are too small, too blended together, and showed very little essence of any of the gardens. Come on! I was just in Provence and with my Ipad and Iphone I have far better stories to tell of the gardens and essence of Provence.I also bought Louisa Jones new book of new garden designs in Provence and much prefer it. I will keep this one. the other will be returned."
1,French Country Gardens,I was looking for a book which would give me the name of flowers to plant in a French Country Garden. This was not it.
3,Useful Thesaurus,The beginning of this book is broken down into chapters from Kindergarten to Sixth grade and gives sample words to use at each level.But the bulk of this book (and most useful part) is a Thesaurus of sorts. It gives word choices for each grade level for each word in the Thesaurus.Overall a good book to get a general idea of the words to use with each grade level.
4,"Valuable tool for writers, editors, teachers, parents","As editorial director of large children's book publisher, the Children's Writer's Word Book is an invaluable tool in preparing and editing manuscripts for K-6 readers. Easy-to-use, well-organized. Inconsistencies pop up from time to time -- but overall, a great reference to have on hand."
1,A thesaurus/dictionary?,"This title is exactly what it is: a thesaurus/dictionary designed for children readers. If you expect anything else from the book you will be disappointed. I was mislead by the title when I read the reviews prior to the purchase. As soon as I got the book and opened it, I realized immediately it wasn't the book that I expected. Also, the book available now appears to be a new edition. The book I am referring to must be the prior edition.Caveat emptor: no matter what book or item you opt to buy, if at all possible, go to your local store and check the item there first before committing to an order. It saves you from a headache."
3,a Teens review,"Alright I have not actually read the book but I did read the part that it shows on Amazon. The style is good but the way that he tells you to write mysteries and stuff, no violence, no dead bodies for preteens. I'm only 13 so I'm not that far out of preteen hood but I have to say that I would be bored with his idea of a good story for this age group. Read the books that are popular now none of them do what he says. I won't give this book a lower review because I have not actually read the whole book and maybe it gets better."
4,Children's Writer's Word Book,"This book is a wonderful source for those who write for children. Albeit, children in target age groups may understand vocabulary at older grade levels. However this book guides and expands vocabulary choice per age range so writers use appropriate language and expand vocabulary according to benchmarks. This book helps focus better word choices for writers.Words children should use are clearly listed by grade.There is an overview of what children may be interested in at that age level. This is helpful for writing topics children want to read.In all, Children's Writer's Word Book, is a worthy reference to own.The book is guided by national standards in education,and benchmarks in learning. Hopefully, this is updated again as things change."
5,Useful for more than just kids,"I was first introduced to Dr. Mogilner's work in an ESL workbook for colleges. It is the only one I have ever found that actually helps the students learn English and think as they use it. As a result, I went looking for anything else she wrote and I found this book.I both teach and write for adults learning English. While some things don't apply, the word levels are exactly the same for adults; just think of it as levels. The material on sentence length and other hints are of great help. Even warnimgs about content are helpful for adults because publishers are as careful about violence, substance use, gambling, etc. as any children's publisher."
5,Children's author essential book,You have to have this book if you want to write for children. It will give you words that match your target group. You can feel confident that your words will be clear and appropriate for your book. GREAT delivery buy the seller too.
2,Game sucks,"Game did not come with instructions. I am a huge horse racing fan, who also bets part time professionally. This game has horrible graphics and the game play stinks. I will not be playing it again. I had high hopes since the reviews were good."
4,"This game is just like the last one, GREAT!","GR 2004 is a great game to play. You have to get used to the controls, but after that, you can't stop playing it. It is fun to bet your money on longshots or even -money favorites in the betting mode, but the career mode is great. Loved it."
5,My Favorite Game!,"I loved this racing, horses, and of course babies, too.My babies grown up into champions. Like Blackjack's Baby. Now she was retired and has a beautiful boy foal. She was special. She beaten Top Ranks in Special Races. Her Dam is Smoky Sphere who was here for 15 years for breeding. Very good mother I've seen. Her four foals was top ranks. Smoky Heat is hers too. He is beautiful sorrel stallion sired by Tender Value. It is a AWESOME GAME!!!! PLEASE BUY THE GAME!!!!!!!!!!"
1,WHAT A WASTE!,"consider this a warning, and be glad that you got one. the movie itself is $20. the new box set (includes the movie) is around $50. this means you get the series for only $30. so if you are going to buy anything, it makes sense to buy the series. and the series, unlike this movie, IS worth buying.now, about the movie... the reason they include it in the new box set is that it's worthless. like one of the other reviewers said, it follows exactly the same story as the series. so, it's basically the first half of the Blue Gender story (and over half of the SAME ANIMATION) crammed into 90 minutes. just imagine how much important stuff is missing! (would you only read every fifth page of a book or take turns and only play every 10th hour of an RPG?) and in addition, it's ""InuYasha'd"" with corny dialogue and the worst ending I have ever seen. it's a shame i can't give zero stars."
2,Unless your a fan...,"Don't bother. This movie tries to slap together over 600 minutes of story and character developement into 90 minutes. Did not work very well at all. So much of the emotion leading the characters throughout the movie is nonexistant. The whole explanation of the B-virus and the reason behind the blue has no part in this film either. I rated this 1 more star than I wanted to becuase if you are a fan of the series and your smart enough to buy the complete collection (whole series + crappy movie) then, what the heck watch it."
3,"Wow...great in some areas, weak in others=cancels itself out","I saw part of the series, and fell in love with it. Too bad it was on Cartoon Network. I bought the movie in hopes of finishing it, since anime's a very expensive hobby, even going mainstream (I fear for the state of anime, what with people believing in dragon ball which is at least a 16 year old franchise).The movie left a sour taste in my mouth, and my wallet. It reeks with ""bargain"". I'm gonna go save up and buy the series set hopefully someday. Characters I grew attached to, such as cute little Yung and Marlene's original retrieval team, die without much character development. Their deaths in the series gave more impact after knowing more about them. I regret buying this, so as everyone else says, BUY/SEE THE SERIES, AVOID THIS, unless you're die-hard to collect it all. This only worth seeing, not keeping, if you have the series."
2,*sigh* Nothing much new here...,"First of all, if you've seen the ""Blue Gender"" series - STOP! If you haven't, I would still suggest seeing the actual series rather than this ""movie."" A few things change here, such as the main character (Yuji) having long hair at the beginning. The ending to this movie is terrible. The real series had a MUCH better ending. The bottom line is if you're expecting to see something new here, expect to be dissapointed. And if you're expecting to pack the full ""Blue Gender"" experience into 100 minutes, you're missing out on A LOT! In summary, get the series, forget the ""movie."""
1,Poo... It was just that bad!,"Imagine, if you will, taking one of the greatest animes ever and chewing it up a pooping it out. All the best and most nutritious bits long gone. What you are left with is waist. Well in this case waist with a new ending nugget of corn... And that corn was rotten when it was first eaten...If you must have this movie, buy the box set. At lest then you get the good stuff and the poo, although why you would want poo in the first place is beyond me..."
5,"""...open your eyes.""","In episodes like these it's difficult to prevent the end result from appearing overly sentimental or even manipualtive. Yet The Visitor is so heartfelt and believable that I couldn't help but be moved by the Siskos' plight. Even a slightly high amount of technobabble is not enough to prevent this, along with Hard Time, from being the best from DS9's season 4."
5,All the tallents are on display here.,"It is difficult to think of a finer example of late 20th century drama. It ranks alongside the work of Spielberg or Stephen King or even Hitchcock at their peak. The premise is Shakespeareian in its simplicity. The performance uses techniques rarely seen outside of theater. Rachel Robinson as explicands. The elevation of musical score to the level of narrative. The passage of time invoking the literary theme of saga. Watching the performances of Tony Todd and Avery Brooks, one is reminded of Paul Robeson."
5,Best Television Show Ever,I don't understand why this episode didn't get the Emmy and I never will. I have never been moved to tears by any tv show I've ever seen. This was a great break from normal Star Trek episode content and was too great for words to describe. Something about it just makes you break down. It was even made my sister cry at the end and she absolutely hates Star Trek. Just buy it and watch some of the best television ever made.
2,Paint yourself?,"First, shame on me for not reading the complete description. I did not realize this was a paint-your-own bank. I thought I was buying a polka dot design. The brush and paints were very poor quality, not easy for a young child to use. I had to trim the brush and pick some bristles out of the paint. As a previous review states, the paint colors are not the colors shown on the package. I will use my own varnish as well because one small pot will not cover the entire bank. If you are crafty and have your own supplies, this is an economical choice. Otherwise, spend a little more for a finished product."
2,Poor quality,"The first time we received this item it arrived in broken pieces, so I didn't look that close at it. I exchanged it thinking it was still a good product. The second time we received it the paint was dried up and it was missing the rubber stopper for the bottom of the bank. Useless! The bank itself is decent, made of clay. Other than that it was a waste of my time and money."
1,Please do your research.,"This is one of the worst oil filters you can ever buy. Please do your research before buying. I had been a fram coustumer for a really long time until i saw a video on youtube where they compare oil filters by opening them up. I was shocked to find out that fram is so cheap. You get what you pay for, but in the long run if you decide to use fram you might be shorting the lifespan of your engine. At the same time i felt cheated by fram because they lied to all the American old timers like myself who had been fooled for so many years. Shame on you fram."
1,may try another brand,I heard that Fram has a smaller filter area inside and use paper as filter material.I am disappointed at this. will try other brand such as Mobile 1
4,Terrific! Will bring a smile to your child's face!,"My son loves to read, and he adores this book. I personally love Trapani's books--while they are not always grammatically correct (the only reason why I don't give it a 5 star rating), they are beautifully illustrated and bring to life some of the most well-known nursery rhymes. It will bring a smile to your child's face!"
2,Original Taxi Wallet,"Service was excellent. I received the wallet much sooner than expected. The product itself is not what I expected. I have an orginal Taxi Wallet purchased from National Geographic many years ago that is made out of a very supple leather. It doesn't take up much room in my purse. My recently purchase Taxi Wallet is missing the ""Original"" logo pressed into the front. Additionally, the leather is not as supple. Consequently, it is not as slim as my original and takes up lots of room. It stiff and not easy to manipulate. Very disappointing."
2,not same quality as earlier,"My wife's handbag was stolen and in the process of replacing all the items, the Taxi was ordered. The new item is not the same fine leather quality as the earlier item and we will be returning it to you."
5,Love the taxi!,"I ordered this taxi wallet for myself. It's neat and slim. It holds dollars and coins and a few credit cards as well. The leather is beautiful (I chose purple,) the wallet well made, and I know it will be in use for a long, long time."
1,Disappointed,"Sad to say it's true. Very disappointed with AudioSource, they normally offer good products for the money. This isn't one.Ordered and received an AudioSource Amp 300 (new) about three months ago and was using it to drive a pair of JBL 4412 studio monitors. After about three months of use, the right channel died. I verified the right channel of this amp had indeed failed by swapping audio inputs and the speaker outputs. Still no right channel.I never abused this amp in anyway. Living in a apartment, volume levels were always kept low and I had the amp placed on a shelve with plenty of ventilation. Even after hours of use, it barely felt warm to the touch.I realize this is an inexpensive amp, but failing this quickly after light use is no excuse. I own several other audiosource products that are several years old and they still work wonderfully. That's why I must give this AudioSource Amp 300 a poor rating. It has a flawed design and I recommend to look elsewhere."
1,It died after just 6 months,"This amp is cheap, but you get what you pay for. I was using to drive 4 speakers (8 ohm bridged). After just 6 months of bi-weekly use, it stopped working."
1,Mine went out too,"After six months of mostly sitting idle in a cool basement with very little playing time, my Amp 300 gave up the ghost too. It just dims the lights as it blows a circuit breaker. After a couple of goes at that, it does nothing at all. I thought about sending it back, but quickly realized that with such poor quality, I don't want even a replacement to be connected to my expensive speakers at all. I don't want them destroyed too the next time it goes out. I am getting a Niles SI-2125."
1,DOA,"I was hesitant on purchasing this Amp300 after all the bad reviews but I have an Amp 100 that I have liked for 1yr now with no problems. After opening the Amp300 and hooking it up, no sound - DOA. I tried multiple inputs and phone call with Audio Source. It seems to me that Audio Source does not have any quality control and does not check their items before sending them out. Not good. I am returning this unit for a refund and will not try another Amp300 after this experience and considering all the other bad reviews. Seems there are a lot of bad units. Weird thing is Audio Source told me they fixed the problems with Amp300 before I purchased. I beg to differ."
5,AudioSource Amp 300 Performs Perfectly!!,"I realize that different people will always have different opinions about products. Especially when it comes to audio equipment.I have owned AudioSource products in the distant past. I wasn't sure what to expect with the Amp 300... but, I found it on sale at Fry's for $149 and couldn't pass it up. I bought two of them. Originally, my intent was to keep one and sell one... but, I ended up using both. In fact, I completely gutted my entertainment system... adding the two AudioSource amps along with a Kenwood Amp and Preamp, in addition to a Yamaha Sound Processor. As you can imagine... the result was spectacular!! The sound pressure levels that are possible are just incredible. The clarity... the tone quality... it's exactly what you want. I found the quality of manufacture to be flawless. Maybe the first one's off the production line has issues... all I can say is that I'm very happy with the equipment and will be looking forward to years of enjoyment."
2,Experience does count...but...,"Camenson definitely has experience in this career with many ""career books"" to her credit. However, there are better books out there on writing with more information. This book follows the same old tired format that VGM books are 'not so' famous for. The internet has more info for a lot less money."
3,Deep Space Nine,An okay episode. Bashir and O'Brien are captured by the Jem Hadar. Bashir tries to break their addiction to a drug while O'Brien tries to escape. A watchable episode but not the best.
4,A great book for new genealogists,"This is a great ""how to"" book for beginning genealogists and a good reference book for anyone searching for their ancestors."
5,love it,Great product I would recommend it to anyone! I really enjoyed what I received. Merry Christmas to all and a Happy New Year
3,Personally don't really like them.,It works great but the little shreds that come off get everywhere. They were a hassle to clean and I had to use a lint roller to get them off of my clothes. I probably won't use these again.
4,This thing is huge!,I bought this because I starting doing DIY sugaring instead of buying wax kits every two weeks. This pack is probably too much for me and these do shed a bit but I like using them plus I will save a lot of money so I will deal with the cleanup process from me cutting the strips.
3,Too Coarse,"Muslin strips are 10000 times better than the paper ones they put in the waxing kits. However these were too coarse, so you can't reuse them as many times as I would like to. The wax goes through the strips by the second use which makes it messier since you're touching it with your hands.I find Natural Muslin Epilating strips by GiGi much more effective. Even though you can't cut them the size you want, they work better and last longer, so will ultimately save you money."
1,I expected more! It's too thin!!!!!!!!!!,I expected this product to be exceptional based on all the stars it has. I am very disappointed. The Muslin roll is way too thin. Very cheap material. The wax seeped through to the other side and made my hands sticky from the wax. Would not recommend this product to anyone!
3,a bit thin,"I use this with my gigi pot...the muslin is ok...its a bit thin, and frays like crazy..but does the job..would be easier to work with if it didnt fray as much, and the hot wax sometimes seeps through the thin fabric..not sure if thicker exists, but its a loooonnngggg roll..so ill be using this one for a long time!"
3,I prefer the white paper roll instead,It gripes hair nicely but sheds a lot. Make sure you Grab a broom or vacuum because its messy to cut. only plus is that it is a lot for the cost.
4,All natural perfect,This was what I was looking for. I like how it's unbleached and you can cut to any size. Just like my salon uses so it's perfect. Works well with the all purpose honee wax. Great buy!!
4,i recommend,"very good but only for use by women,not men's work.i buy for my use and my boyfreind but does not work for"
1,Poor quality,"Quality is kinda cheap, a lot of shreads come off and stick to your hands, because when you wax your legs with this product the wax consistently seeped through the material. Bad experience, I expected much better!"
1,Buyer Beware - Poor Quality of Muslin,"I've bought GiGi Natural Muslin Rolls several times in the past and from other Amazon vendors.... However, the stuff I got from this seller in particular looked and felt very different - thinner and looser woven fabric. When I waxed my legs using this product the wax consistently seeped through the material and onto my hands making the experience that much more agitating. I have a strong suspicion that this item is actually a knock-off and not the REAL GiGi Natural Muslin Rolls (which are actually quite nice)."
5,Great trips and loads of it!,"Great price, great shipping time and great strips.They are a nice quality, cut easily and I think I might have a life time supply now.."
5,Perfect compact brush,"I have bought two of these, one for my gym bag, and one for home. My wife has the full size, which is larger than I need, and doesn't fit on the bathroom sink as easily.The brush is just the right size and more comfortable than a comb, and doesn't snag your hair. It has a no-slip grip for ease of use just out of the shower, and the little rubber bristle end protectors that make the brush comfortable to use are ALL still attached to every bristle on all three brushes after years of use, which is amazing in the day of cheaply made products that fall apart quick!"
4,At least I Understand the intent,"The last reviewer doesn't get it. This CD is meant to be used by DJ's around the world, building on top of the beats in their own ways. This CD is not about showcasing Billy, it's about showcasing the DJ's. Furthermore, what's wrong with these grooves? Some of them are extremely sexy. I am excited to hear the remix CD."
2,Where's Billy?,"Illy B, what happened? As a drummer who has taken much from the stylings of Billy Martin, I thought I'd find the concept of an album featuring his break beats fascinating. What happened to the seemingly impromptu and free-flowing style I've heard and seen with MMW? This whole album could have been created in an hour using looping samples- it's so monotonous! I've heard techno with more diverse percussion. Sorry, Billy. I still love you, but I'm not buying this album!"
3,The Emissary returns,"The wormhole opens and a Bajoran lightship emerges, old and battered, the pilot, Akorem, claims to ""the Emissaey"". The story centres around Sisko and his realisation of how much he loves his emissary status and that he muct compete with Akorem and reclaim his right as the representative of the Prophets. When Akorem returns to Bajor he revives some 300 year old traditions that force Kira to return home and instead of being a military officer she must become make clay birds - it's true. Akorem brings back a cast system where you are judged by your name and family history, not as individuals.An engaging tale that ends well, but still the whole Bajoran-storyline is fare from the most interesting one Deep Space Nine has come up with!"
5,in the mood,"Mood music has gotten a bad name. Mood music is not elevator music,not smooth jazz, not muzak. Here two albums of great,lyrical,slow cooking jazz are offered from the first of Cal Tjader's career and at the end of his Fantasy label years. Tjader is muy simpatico through out plus these great standards feature, as they always do with Tjader, terrific sidemen. When talents like pianist Hank Jones get featured you know you can not go wrong. Very fine folks."
5,Vince's Debut,"This is Vince Guaraldi's ""first recordings"" and it's amazing how good he was way back in 1951. Obviously Vince is much more than just the pianist that helped make the Peanuts one of the most memorable, heartfelt, inspiring shows of all time; he was a true Be-Bop jazz pianist. In the same league as Red Garland but even more original and so full of emotion.Also give due credit to Cal Tjader for inspiring Vince with his awesome Latin/Jazz creation."
1,Daniel Green Shimmer slipper,"Sorry but I have to say this: I ordered a size 7 slipper and thats what came BUT the design is so economically created that it is so tight I cant use them. I thought it might be tight so this size is one larger than what I wear....size 6. I dont know what I would have received if I had ordered that size. Never again. I buy a great deal from Amazon and could not do without them but NO MORE slippers. JoanPiorkowski 1110 Cozzens Lane, No.Brunswick NJ 08902 (JPiork5603@Aol.Com)"
1,Boring...,"This is a terrible outing for the Deep Space Nine team, it concentrates on Jake and his new found friend, some witch like women called Onaya. Using some strange energy field she allows Jake to write more than he has ever written before, addicted to this ladies strange field Jake becomes a walking talking Zombie. It takes ages for everyone to realises, which just means we have to sit through 40 minutes of rubbish, a lame script that wastes the talent of Ciroc Loftman and Avery Brooks."
5,I love this Book!!,"I love this book! The photos are terriffic; true junk yard dogs, just as they are, right smack in their environments. Mark Lamonica (whom I've discovered is actually a Shakespeare scholar) matched his rich photos perfectly with Shakespearean quotes. Every time I buy this book I turn around and give it away to another friend :)"
4,Very happy to have found this,"This is the final Lost at Last album. It is good, with some strong tracks, but I still love their first cd the best. This is worth adding to your Lost At Last collection. It does expand beyond what they previously have done. If you don't have any L@L, there is a best of cd available. I feel fortunate that I got to see them years ago- incredible live show. Saw the Lost At Last Tribe reunion in 2011 as well. Jaya has several albums on her own but they are straight up kirtan - not dance (or as it is now called: kirtronica) One of the other band members, Om, is continuing on in the dance/rhythm genre - Om At Last - cd dropping in 2012."
2,Reads like a newspaper column,"The opinions and views expressed in this book are mostly accurate. But the overall impression is definitely one of looking at Buddhism from the outside. If the reader wants to learn how do Do Buddhism, check out Buddhist Sutras: Lesson Book which includes this text in its bibliography, and is a collection of quotes from other more scholarly texts."
4,caribe 2000,My husband and I were in Dominican Republic in the fall of 2002 and the girls at the bar were playing this music that my husband and I fell in love with. We went all over Sosua looking for it and noone had it. They tried to give us 2002. The only place I could find it was here online. Thanks Amazon! The music is upbeat and fun to listen to even if you don't understand all of it!
2,Smelly carbon block filter,"This filter unit install easily under the sink but came with the wrong second filter (sediment). Once I received the correct carbon block filter the water began to have a very sour taste and odor. Crystal Quest recommended a particular flushing method that involves two sessions 24 hours apart but this failed to correct the foul odor. It's difficult to understand how a carbon filter can cause such a bad taste to water. I will be returning it for a refund, moving on to a different company's under sink filter.Two stars because of the helpfulness of the Crystal Quest support people. Hopefully the company will get a handle on this problem in the near future."
1,new title: Hot Flash,"But she is bright enough to keep it at bay. Sandra Locke is the beautfiul southern actress I admired since I was a child for her unique beauty.I bought this knowing that it took two to Tango and I stay with it. She sounds bitter and like she does live to be a victim.If my memory serves me correctly, she had limited success and she made her name in the 70's through Clint Eastwood. She did not have this great success she claims before him. Now that her meal ticket is closed off, she is resounding victimhood. What she denies in the book is actually what she is doing.Save the money and watch the Lifetime channel to hear how women are victimized on a daily basis."
1,One star rates this book too highly!,"Sondra Locke asks for our sympathy. What she needs is a reality check. I think her book proves that Sondra Locke is not only mentally ill, but a ""user"", as well. Why, she even uses a revised title of Clint Eastwood's movie for her own book's promotion! I only wonder when people like her will finally wake up and realize that the only reason they are recognized at all is BECAUSE of their ""relationships"" to celebrities and not the other way around. My recommendation: Spend the money for the book on some Clint Eastwood videos. You have to admire anyone who put up with what he had to!"
2,not a 'must read',"Well, in the end let me just say that words, both good and bad usually tell more about the author than they do about the person they are about... ."
1,"In Spite Of""""","Title should have been ""In Spite Of"", Clearly this actress had little talent, rarely ever nailed a scene and for years us Clint Eastwood fans struggled to find whatever it was he saw in this woman, Clearly to be given an opportunity to be cast with Clint Eastwood in his Film making Prime should be spoken with at least some measure of gratefulness,However Sandra Lockes character was equal to her acting ability 0 out of 5 stars. She was most certainly a hiccup in Clints Brilliant Career"
1,Lies And Spin,"My whole family watches the Clint Eastwood movies, we like them very much and think Mr. Eastwood is a great actor. Sondra Locke is just telling a bunch of lies just because Mr. Eastwood did not want to marry her, I can see why also. If Mr. Eastwood was such a cold hearted weirdo, why does he have seven kids and has been married twice? Anyway, don't buy this book, if you want some good laughs rent it from The Libary. Go out and buy 'High Plains Drifter'."
5,A Hollywood tale unlike any other. . .,"I'll confess - I only knew about Sondra Locke from her films with Clint Eastwood, and I only read the book to find out about their messy breakup. But her autobiography is about so much more - it's a story of a lifelong career and spiritual journey, and unlike most of us, Ms. Locke has been accompanied by an amazing companion along the way - Gordon Anderson, her lifelong friend. It's a Hollywood story all right - country girl misunderstood by her family makes it big - but it's a Hollywood story unlike any other. You may buy it for the dirt. . . but you should buy it if you believe in the human spirit, and the greater forces outside ourselves."
1,This book should be renamed: My Pity Party,"One does not have to read far into this joke of a book before realizing that it is a poorly disguised attempt to exact revenge on Clint Eastwood. Ms. Locke's attempts to gain sympathy, however, rapidly deteriorate into one big ""pity party"" where she blames all her frequent poor decisions on whoever happens to be in her life at the present moment. Her rationalizations for her inane actions are laughable. I truly feel the only reason Gordon stays in the picture is because he feeds her superficial and highly self-absorbed ego. In the end, it is apparent that Mr. Eastwood was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Ms. Locke should grow up and stop feeling sorry for herself. As for the book, don't waste your money on this one."
1,NEEDED HERE: A DOSE OF REALITY,"This is one of the strangest books I have ever read. Who knows what the truth is concerning Ms. Locke's relationship with Mr. Eastwood? All of these people mentioned in this book are living in Self-Absorption Land. Her relationship with her husband is even more bizarre. Having your cat freeze-dried after it dies? Huh? Oh, yes. Mystical indeed! If they ever decide to make a made for TV movie from this story, it should be presented on the Sci-Fi channel. Beam them all up Mr. Scott, sounds like they are waiting for the flying saucers, anyway!"
2,Mediocre - even for those who can't stand Clint Eastwood,"The book was interesting but often had a definite agenda or, in some places, vendetta. Several pages were wasted in a kind of tribute to husband Gordon that was difficult to take seriously. Spotting a licence plate that has some remote coincidence or connection to the days events might POSSIBLY be an act of God, but does not elevate this man to a higher spiritual status than the rest of us. This was especially hard to swallow when the professional ""verification"" likely cost large celebrity dollars to acquire. Mostly readable but those particular pages drag on and the moral of the story ending detracts from the book's earlier good qualities."
5,Terrific Read,"I not much into celebrity worship or reading the latest poop about movie stars,but I did always wonder what was behind Clint Eastwoods sudden disaffection with long time partner Sondra Locke.I happened to be looking at Amazon when I seen this book,and it had great reviews so I thought why not satisfy my curiosity. I wasn't disappointed Ms Locke tells a wonderful story about her life and how she made it all the way to Hollywood and her dream that included a relationship with one of tinsel towns biggest stars,and how it all went wrong and turned into a nightmare. Sondra Locke is a very talented writer who lets you get to know her and keeps you interested from cover to cover. I'll never think of the movie business and its stars the same,especially Clint Eastwood."
1,Jake and Bashir become soldiers - ahhhhhhhhh!,"Jake is doing an interview with Doctor Bashir on the frontlines of the Klingon-Starfleet warzone. When the Kligon's attack in brutal fashion Jake has to change his opinion of war, it is not just the glamourous ship to ship battles but the gritty trench wars in which innocent people die.The storyline was good and had potential but wasn't given the fully bloody, gritty treatment it deserved and would've sent a better message about war, the true message it was trying to deliver. One of the few episodes given to Jake which he acts great in, pitty no one else does!"
4,good start for homeschooling families,"I like it because it gives the basic core subjects with reproducibles, craft ideas, and plenty of extras for further study. One of my favorite things about the entire series is that there is no set schedule that one must adhere to. I can choose to do math three times and history twice per week, or if one day of the week is a holiday, I'm not behind in anything. The subjects are arranged and labeled well: I like the numbering system...easy to keep track of.I would not say this is EVERYTHING your child should know for each grade, but what is does have does cover the basics, and gives plenty of ideas for more research."
1,not what i expected,not the same as more well known 'everything your 4th grader should know' series. too much parent input needed for me.
2,No directions for the hanger. Confusing,Brushes are ok. But the main part is to get the Camelbak dry. Not helpful.
2,"Poorly edited, needs a major update!","This book is required reading by my LIS academic libraries class and I'm not ecstatic about the book. There are typographical errors, grammatical errors (and before you slam me for typos remember something please; this is a professional publication!) and table errors.Why is it that if you slam a book you get nailed for a bad review? Whenever I say there's a problem with a book someone slams it, not for the book being bad I believe, but for actually saying it wasn't very good!5/12/12 update-Just as I expected, so far only 0 for 1. What am I supposed to do praise the crappy book?"
2,I guess you don't bake with it?,I've tried it to sweeten oatmeal and I've tried it to bake cookies. In both cases it tasted horribly bitter with a very sick sweet after taste. From research I found that can happen with baking. I thought it was designed for baking though. My wife likes it even less than I do. Now I need to figure out what to do with the rest of the box.
4,"Ethiopia's problems, failures, and future issues",This book by Cohen describes Ethiopia's socioeconomic developement by the telling of past failures to such an extent that any person who reads this title would learn more about the problems of Ethiopia than by looking many books up in the library and getting only tid-bits of information. It is a very project friendly book.
2,Acu-Cat Disappointing,"Bought copies for a friend and for myself. My friend, a veterinarian, says points shown do not always match reality. She is working with me to make corrections when needed."
3,alright gun...I guess.,"I bought the gun because of the price,its okay. i only use the semi automatic mode on it, because with only 13 bbs(mine only holds that many, even tho it says it holds 15 bbs) you run out of ammo way to fast, and tends to shoot a bit to the left, on full automatic. all in all im probably going to get a better gun once i have the money."
2,Doesn't last,"This gun unfortunately stopped working a few days after I got it. I hadn't abused it or anything either: the motor just burned out in the middle of firing a shot. If you want to buy an electric pistol, I would advise searching for a better one, because with this gun, you get exactly what you pay for.Here's how it performed for the few days that it did work, in case you still want to buy it--after all, just because mine broke doesn't mean that they all break.ProsSemi or full auto fire.Hop up.Clip is speed loadable (with a little creativity).Runs on AAA batteries--no charger to wait for.ConsLow power.Not terribly accurate.I would reccomend using this gun as a sidearm. It doesn't have the range or power to be your primary weapon unless you're doing an indoor or very close quarters match. But if you're a sniper pinned down by an automatic, or a rifleman with an empty magazine, then a gun like this might be your salvation."
3,Fun for a while,This was a fun little gun for a while. One of the battery springs was messed up so it lasted a while then broke. So I painted the tip black and now it hangs on my wall and is looking cool. Doesn't hurt bad at all. NOT FOR REAL MATCHES.
5,VERY GOOD GUN FOR 10$,Let me tell you that this gun is very good . Works great but it doesnt have a good accuracy.Semi and full auto are both good.For 10 $ this gun great.
1,Just a Piece of S*$T,"I bought this product and it arrived right on schedule. I though it was good cause it ran on battery's and you don't have to wait to charge it. I played with it for a day. Next day, played with it again for two seconds then it just stopped working. I could hear a gear grinding against something. I tried to open the gun up, first thing, there is lead in the handle, a big piece of led, i fought with the gun, trying to open it, the barrel is super glued to both parts of the outer plastic, i saw the gear, put it back in, same problem, it fell out again, opened it back up, the motor was smoking, and 2 pieces were cracked in it. This is the worst gun ever to buy."
4,Worth the money.,"For under $20, this gun is a deal. I wasn't expecting much, but I have yet to have a problem. The full auto mode is inefficient, since the speed isn't high up there, but semi auto is great for backyard games. Fair amount of power for it's size. B+."
3,Not for me,"I was excited to read this book, but after perusing it carefully, I realized that I could not accept some of Yust's beliefs. In several instances she equates the Christian and Muslim faiths and equally encourages praying to either God or Allah.I do think she has a great grasp of learning to incorporate the spiritual into everyday life, so there are definitely some tips that could be helpful. I personally do not share her premise, and think that some of her ideas are misleading to people."
4,does the job,these look great in our 10 gallon tank- colors are nice- very fitting for a child's tank that is brightly colored
3,"Purple looks great, blue looks pretty cheesy","The ceramic balls are nicer than the traditional plastic cups for holding the plants down. The purple plant looks great in my tank but I couldn't dare put the blue one in with a straight face.If they sold these individually I would give the purple plant 5 stars and the blue 2. As a pair I would have given it 4 stars except one of the blue leaves fell off almost immediately, so that's a -1 for overall quality."
5,great for the biorb,looks great in the cylinder biorb. They are just the right height and blend in very well with the included bio media
4,Very Beautiful!,"When it arrived, I noticed that half of the bottom part of the purple plant was broken, but it doesn't matter because that part would be hidden under the gravel. I'm just saying that the delivery was a little crummy. But I am very pleased how they both look in the tank... especially the blue plant. It's bright and it shines in my tank as well. Very pleased with the product. Hope this helps!"
2,different from picture hard plastic,the purple plant is actually purple and green and the blue ones roots are not as big as shown in picture it was expensive for something that could hurt my fish purple one is not straight like shown in picture i will update when it is in my aquarium.
1,nice looking but.......,Looks beauty but my gold fishes got parasitr on their tails and bleeding. My son was able to removed from two of five fishes saved two. other three then die.
3,Not That Great,"I bought these plants for my betta fish's 5 gallon tank. He already had a few plants in there, but I wanted him to have a few more. When I got the plants I was shoked. There were a very tough plastic material that looked very fake. When I put them in there my betta swam away from them as soon as possible (I know it takes some time for them to get used to new things, but I have never seen him react like this). They are just okay, but I have seen plants a lot better and more realistic looking. They look a lot different than the picture, so be very careful when buying them."
2,Not for betta fish-- very rough! An accident waiting to happen,"These would probably be fine for a fish tank where tearing fins is not a concern, but these are the scratchiest, sharpest plant leaves I have ever encountered... a major fail for my betta tanks. I thought I could make do by trimming off the leaves with scissors and floating small pieces at the top of the water, but I still fear the damage to fins. I ended up putting the smaller one into a snail tank... the larger one is too large for any tanks I have (up to 2.5 gallons.)"
3,not that real looking!,"This is the only plant that really sticks out in my tank everything else looks real but these,,, only thing i like they dont float"
3,they look pretty,"these look nice in the tank but are a hardish plastic and have no flow with the water in the tank. my fish dont enjoy them as much as the silk type to swim among, but they do add great color to the tank."
2,Not what I expected,"I've always been picky about my decorations. I figured since these were made by a well known company and had good reviews I'd give it a shot. Well the blue one is extremely flat and won't fan out or move, and the ""purple"" one is actually half green and looks quite terrible. The blue coloring on the one also looks much more extreme than in the pictures. Overall very dissatisfied. I guess I'll be buying my decorations from stores from now on, while they may cost more at least I know what I'm actually getting."
3,Easy,"These, as are most of the Biorb products, are attractive and cleverly designed. You just drop them into the tank and they float to the bottom. No fuss, no muss. Very pleased."
2,Horrible Plants,"These plants are horrible. For a first, they don't look like real plants, they look like plastic, once I put it into my tank my fish swam away. Also their colour comes off and soon their only colour is white! Third of all, they produce more dirt than the tank. Furthermore the plant come out of it's base and takes over hours to put back in. Very bad plants!"
3,Just OK,"I purchased a Biube and the Biube plants. I am using them, however, I also went to a pet store and purchased some other tank decor as well. I believe silk plants are better and more realistic. If you buy a Biube or Biorb, the assiciated plant items are not necessory."
2,biOrb,"I honestly do not understand all the stellar reviews. These look much better in the pictures. In your fish tank they look like cheap plastic plants. I ended up sanding the bottom of the orbs so they would sit flat, otherwise they roll over sideways. But they weren't even attractive so I threw them out and went with the weighted silk variety."
4,Beautiful look,"Plants look so very realistic! Outstandingly beautiful and so easy to install and clean.Only complain I have a about is that both Plant's size it's extremely alike. One is huge while the other is tiny, i wasn't expecting such big difference since it is not specified in the description. Box simply states ""Medium"" size, and actually I consider one as ""big"", and the other as ""small"".Besides that, they defenitely improved my aquarium appealing... everybody loves it now, specially my fish! =D"
4,Sisko learns there is a Changeling loose on the Defiant,"Captain Sisko is approached by Ambassador Krajensky and informed of a coup on the Tzenkethi home world. The Ambassadors requests the Defiant make a tour of Federation colonies near Tzenkethi space to head off any possible aggressive actions. However, it turns out the Ambassador is really a Changeling, sent to start a war. It certainly took the writers of DS9 a long time to get around to an episode based on the rather obvious idea of the Changelings using their shape-shifting abilities in the war between the Dominion and the Federation. Of the course the chief fun of this episode is figuring out whose identity the Changeling has taken next as ""The Adversary"" becomes a game of cat and mouse. I do not think this episode takes full advantage of the possibilities, especially since the Changeling's final disguise is a rather obvious choice, but it is still a decent outing for Sisko and company."
4,The Founders finally dominate the Federation,"For the first time, the Founders, Odo's people, and the Dominion's gods, dominate the Federation. In a party celebrating Sisko's promotion to Captain, he secretly speaks with Admiral Krajensky. The admiral explains that there is trouble on the Tzenkethi Homeworld that could possibly endanger Federation colonists. So, Sisko goes to the Tzenkethi Homeworld in the U.S.S. Defiant. Unbeknownst to the crew of the Defiant, the admiral is actually a Founder, one of Odo's people, trying to rid Odo of the Solids. Not much later, the U.S.S. Defiant picks up a distress call from the Federation colony. The line goes dead, meaning the colony has been destroyed. Dax scans everyone, and when she gets to the admiral, it turns into a Changeling and escapes the bridge. Sisko gets furious and wants the Changeling found on board the U.S.S. Defiant. The rest is for you to buy this video and see for yourself."
3,A Irish boy with a great heart,"This book is about a Irish boy (Renny). Who is 13 and lives in an all irish mining camp with his da (dad), his mam (mom), and to sisters (Nora and Bridgey). One day whale Nora and Renny were at school a Chinese boy (zi) come in with Miss Maynerd (the owner of one of the gold mines). Miss Maynerd wants to get zi an eduction. the miners are outraged.I liked the book because it showed me how hard it was back in there time, and how much race impacted there thought."
3,A Different Kind of Hero,"A Different kind of Hero is middle school reading level book.It is about a 13 year old boy who lives in Colorado mining countryaround the early 1880's. The boy befriends a chinese boy who comes to the town with his father to be a house servant. This is in the runner of the towns house. There is lots of contraversy around the boy and his father. The white Irish boy goes against most of the town and more importantly his father. This story tests what a boy believes in, and his fathers love, and friendship."
1,useless,"not worth the money. short, skeletal format with very little new information. much better off buying the marc cosentino book on case studies. its far, far better. this book lacks numbers and solutions to the type of case studies youll be asked and is basically useless."
4,"The trial of Commander Worf, or, A Few Good Klingons","The Klingon Empire wants Worf to stand trial for murder and ""Rules of Engagement"" deals with the extradition hearing that follows. Worf was captaining the Defiant when it escorted a Cardassian relief convoy that was attacked by two Klingon warships. When a third vessel started to uncloak, Worf opened fire and destroyed a transport ship carrying civilians (Klingon civilians, no less). Interestingly enough, Worf is charged with ""knowingly"" destroying the civilian transport, which is rather hard to do since it was decloaking at the time, but what the heck. ""Rules of Engagement"" is a slightly below-average episode of DS9 in which the performances are all fine, but the storyline does not hold together if you look at it too closely, especially from the Klingon point-of-view. The episode does underscore the lovely animosity between the Klingons and the Cardassians, who really do not like being enemies of the same enemy, the Dominion."
2,Worf is on trial!,"The war between the Federation and Kligon Empire is claiming more casualties, one of them a freighter carrying Klingon civilians, any attack on these such transport low-risk vessels is prohibited, and so the Rules of Engagement explores what is right and wrong in war and ultimately how Worf is framed for the murder of several dozen innocent Kligon's.Worf gave the order to fire on the frieghter and thus must face trial. An hit-and-miss episode that is like so many Star Trek court stories that have gone before it... the good guy is always innocent."
3,Kasidy is a Maquis?,"Someone is sending supplies and information to the Maquis, so Odo and Eddington investiage. The results are shocking, Kasidy Yates is infact the person behind it all. Not knowing what to do, Sisko arrests Kasidy, his lover. He is forced to send he to prison knowing that the person he loves is behind bars because of him!"
3,Interesting Choices and Covers,"I couldn't believe when my local public radio station played one of the Richard Thompson covers from cd2. I had to call to ask which of his CD's featured the song and thus learned about this set of 1000 years of popular music. Some of the songs on the first CD are renaissance-type songs, but CD2 includes recognizable covers. Any fans of Richard Thompson's strong guitar skills and his rich voice will love it. You'll surprise your friends when you throw some of these tunes into your party music mix."
1,Could this be any worse?,"Bad writing, wooden characters, stupid plot. Karen Kay used to be a good writer. What happened? Pass this stinker by!"
1,Elementary Knowledge,"This book is a good start for someone that has no idea what to do to take care of their muscles and joints. As a martial artist, active in the gym (weights) and a therapeutic massage therapist, I found this book to be a waste of time. On the positive side, it is a quick read and I have reinforced, by second oppinion (the book), that I know more about taking care of myself than the average bear. In purchasing this book, I was hoping to find something that I didn't already know or something that I didn't think was common sense. If you have never played sports, never taken care of your body (stretching, contrast therapies, proper posture) then this book is for you."
4,Wish I had this guide in massage school,"As an ambitious new massage therapist I started a bit too aggressively without thinking how proper ergonomics would affect my long term career goals. My neck, shoulders and hands were hurting after only 6 months of opening my practice. Now I follow the ergonomics and exercise advice in this book and am 100% pain free. This book not only helped me understand the mechanism of pain conditions, but how I could help myself...and my clients! This book should be required reading in massage school."
4,Almost too thorough,"This is such a well done book. The information is extensive. Unfortunately it was kind of too extensive, and very dry, so by the time I got to how to protect myself I was a bit freaked out by (what is presented as) the almost certainty that sooner or later I will get injured, and also I was tired of reading the not very interesting presentation. Also, as an artist, I wish the pictures of exercises were better drawn.I gave this 4 stars because this is such valuable information and not easily found elsewhere. With this book, you really won't need to look elsewhere. It's all here. This is a very important reference tool."
2,Didnt work for me.,Had a pigeon problem. Thought this might keep them off my roof. It didnt. California.
3,A Thoughtful and Engrossing Read,"This is a compelling book even though a lot of the characters are simple. I don't mean that in a cruel way like ""simple"" as in ""dumb."" The autistic hero is likeable and smart and dedicated. The problem is the bad guys are simply bad and the surrounding cast of the hero's supporters are simply good, so a lot of the potential suspense is obvious. It's a very well-written story with the imagery and emotional the resonance. I really started to root for the hero. I just got impatient with middle part of the book waiting for the plot to develop."
5,I give it two thumbs up!,"I just finished reading this book. WOW! I didn't realize when reading the dust jacket that the story happens some time in the future. Very thought-provoking topic. My eyes have been opened wider than usual, and my mind has definitely been challenged. I've got some serious thinking to do!The book was well written and the story was easy to understand; however, I did become emotionally overwhelmed at times while reading it and needed to take occasional breaks because of this.Well worth reading. I give it two thumbs up!"
5,true to life,"Started this book last night and am already halfway through, it is so engaging and well written. One thing that the other reviewers have not mentioned is that the author's son is mostly likely autistic. I surmised that from the dedication and acknowledgements pages. Although the only people who really understand autism are autistics themselves, I'd say that Moon has a special insight based on her personal experience and no doubt wide knowledge of it. Add that to her great writing and you've got a great read.I work in the mental health field and plan to recommend it to all my coworkers."
1,Started good,"The book started great, I recommended it to my book group based upon the first few chapters, the it got really weird."
4,Very Interesting Book,"The main character is autistic, and the author gives a great insight in to the way an autistic person thinks (whether or not it's accurate is another question, but it's interesting reading). Set in the near future, not a heavily scientific sci-fi book, but a lot of really good character developoment. A nice foil for the behavior of everyday people. Recommended."
5,spectacular insightful book,"As a professor who teaches child psychopathology, I found Moon's insight into autism incredible. Her characters were believable and her ability to add humanism into significant ethical dilemnas was marvelous. A good read."
2,Where's the Beef?,"The author took a novel and very interesting concept, and one with a lot of potential, and proceeded to come up woefully short after droning on and on about the minutiae of Lou's life, often covering the same ground over and over and over. Precious few - and rather threadbare - pages were devoted to exploring what was purported to be the major theme of 'normalcy'.How this book won the Nebula award for best novel, I'll never know - except that somebody has to win each year. If this is the best Sci Fi had to offer during the award period, it was indeed a poor year."
2,Pretty boring...,"Pretty boring. Silly at times. Weak plot. I'm also not sure you can describe how autism ""feels"" to an autistic. The very concept of what defines autism varies tremendously."
2,mildly entertaining,"This book grabbed my attention as I began reading it, but I just could not finish it. You get the point of how protagonist perceives the world from the first chapter, then it becomes really tiresome. Tiresome so much , that I did not even finish reading it, I could not care less what will happen to the guy."
4,good story,Enlightening for the person that is not familiar with autism. Some of the story becomes a little far fetched at the end but that wouldn't change my recommendation. Glad I read it and would recommend to others.
4,Speed of Dark,"An readable, engaging and thought-provoking essay on being autistic, coupled with an infernal moral and human issue ... do we ""repair"" autistics? It was too short!"
1,A good escape back to the seventies.,"The tape I received was grainy, low quality (home-made)in appearance and my tape had not been completely erased (there was part of another movie at the end of Bad Georgia Road). This film was only about $8.00 plus shipping and the transaction was amazingly fast. As for the film, it is typical 70's B style, lousy acting but a good escape for 90 minutes."
3,"Good, but not worth $100","This 1973 book was fine for way back then. It has about 26 different cake design ideas. Now days, you can find the same styles of ideas online for free. It's paperback and originally cost $1.25. Now you can easily find a similar style book for just a little more than the original cost."
2,suspicious of suspicion,"I am suspicious of the U.S. Government as any thinking person should be. Everyone should know that governmentexists primarily to forward it's own interest which is to preserve and increase it's own power. Loose change points out several troubling details about the event of 9/11 maintaining that the terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and on the World Trade Center were in fact perpetrated by the U.S. Government in order to justify another war among other reasons.I enjoyed the show and was very disturbed by the segment about the crash into the Pentagon actually being a missile attack. I found the segment very convincing.I do not wish to give away too much, so just let me conclude by saying that this documentary is definitely worth another look."
1,Good baramoter for identifying people who can't deal with anything besides what television shows them,"Anybody who can't make up / wake up their own mind after seeing this film is hopeless in terms of autonomous thought. Just put your headphones in and skip down the way there jimmy... Wait for your next commercial that will tell you what do do. But jimmy is the future to the powers that be so for those who are awake, appear asleep. This is nothing to be afraid about it is simpily a necessary evil that must run its course in order to be properly identified and understood so that tyrants may never hide in their towers amongst peacefull societys of the future. Try to enjoy your servitude"
5,Who is the enemy?,"after watching this video of the September 11, 2001 (911) event. One would draw the conclusion that the enemy is not from overseas. They are right hear in our own (white) house backyard."
4,Can't Prove it But...,"I am not a conspiracy theorist type of person. I don't believe all the anecdotal evidence provided in this video is worthy of a bulletproof case against the ""powers"" that be. With that said, this video should be viewed by everyone who cares about the world in which we live since the events of September 11, 2001 have done more to shape our country than any other event in recent history. If you don't want to buy the DVD you can watch the full version on YouTube.com for free."
3,Better alternatives are available,"We purchased this to replace one that we had owned for almost twenty years. This type of cart is very useful for a variety of home owner tasks. Our original one was one of the U.S. made versions that are still available from Vermont. This one is a poor copy made in China. The biggest drawback to the Precision cart is the too-small wheels. They provide insuficient ground clearance when using the cart on rough terrain such as along the steps of a stone pathway on our property. Also, I am skeptical how long the 1/2"" plywood will last when moving firewood in the cart.I initially asked to return the product, but the freight would have been over $40 and it was going to a location in the same state!If you shop around on the web, this and similar carts can be bought for under a $100, which is about their true value, IMHO.After using this product for a couple of weeks, I actually have decided to give it to a friend and purchase the one I should have in the first place."
5,Nice,This is my first silver necklace. I have had it on since I purchased it and I have received a lot of complements. It is also comfortable to wear.
4,"Pretty Flower pendant , not crazy about the chain .","I have had this in my wish list for quite some time, so when I racked up some certificates, I decided to purchase it for myself.The pendant is pretty and very shiny, but the chain (which is fairly dull)that it came on did nothing for the pendant, I had an extra 16"" diamond cut snake chain, which has a bit more shine and I had purchased it awhile ago on Amazon.I placed the pendant on that and they look beautiful together, I was at first thinking of returning this product, but after I changed out the chain I LOVE IT !!"
2,this should be illegal,"the title is too close to the great Yellowbeard movie with Cheech and Chong (and others from Monty Python). I was so excited. Just for kicks, and realizing that Yellowbeard (the great movie) has been out of print for sometime, I thought I'd take a chance and see if the movie distributor was at least putting out a DVD version of the movie. That's when I got my shock! I entered yellowbeard, and I get a hit!!! I was almost ready to dance around the room when I noticed the ""swamp critters"" subtitle. Talk about a swing of emotions..."
4,Yellow Beard:A funny movie but not for everone.,An adult oriented movie that is aimed at the Cheech and Chong type crowd. The plot is not very important but the gags are aimed at many levels of awareness. Some partial nudity and jokes that use a 70'S and 80'S reference's leave questions about suitability for children. Young adults may not understand or like the implied inferences in the jokes. All in all an entertaining time waster for an older generation baby boomer.
4,G. Belmar,I recently had a baby and I received this book from a friend. It instantly put a smile on my face and made me feel good about the experience I have just been through.I plan to purchase more copies for baby shower gifts!
5,Wonderfully and honestly written,I loved the collection of poems in this book. It takes you from the beginning to the end with continuously hilarious poems relating to pregnancy and childbirth. I am pregnant with my first child and this book has helped me keep my sense of humor while experiencing all aspects of pregnancy. The illustrations were also unique and imaginative.
4,Holograms gone mad,The doctor materializes in sickbay to discover the entire ship has been abandoned and heavily damaged. In his attempt to figure out what happened he runs into Torres who with the captain stayed behind to try to save the ship from a warp core breach. Janeway is on the bridge unconscious so B'elanna transfers him there to assist. Later on he is approached by Barclay who says he is a real person who is suffering from kenoplasmic radiation exposure and can't be freed. The only way he can save his life is to destroy the ship!!!!!
2,Not Voyager's best outing,"This episode was okay, but I wouldn't call it a significant contribution to Season Two of Vogager.In this episode, which involves principally the character of The Doctor, we begin to question what's real and what's hologram...interesting premise, since we thought we had all of this settled!We arrive that this confused state through the workings of none other than Reg Barclay of ""Star Trek The Next Generation"" fame! It turns out that Reg is back at Jupiter Station running a holodeck program that has gone terribly wrong...and informs the doctor that his next decisions will be crucial to his own holo-survival!Robert Picardo, as ususal, does a good job with his part. But I was not overly impressed with the way this episode was written - somewhat confusing in parts, and didn't do much to get Voyager Season Two off to a running start!"
4,Clever* Witty* Funny* Great Mystery*,"I recommend you pick ""Butcher Holler"" up next time you are looking for something to read that will keep you guessing until the end!Written with a sharp wit, the author gives you characters that could very well be living in the hills of Kentucky.Nice job on his debut novel! Can't wait until Mr. Fugett writes his next one."
3,Holler - PLEASE!,"If you're from the hills of KY or TN you might enjoy the book. If you're not, the dialect may take some getting used to. Story line could have used a few more edits. Not a horrible start for a new author though."
1,Aweful and Painful,"I purchased this product to help ease up on some of my pregnancy discomfort at the recommendation of my OB. When it arrived I tried it right on and OUCH!! it was so painful, it pinched and didn't allow for me to breath. I had purchased the correct size and was not impressed. I sent it back the very next day. Very disappointed."
4,Do Not By Pass This Book!,"This is really a great book and well worth the money and the time. Its very useful for all wiccans/pagans that have been in the Craft for some time. I do not recommend this book to beginners though until they are in the Craft for some time. This book is one of the best books that i've read this year and ask all of you to please pick it up and not pass this one up, its a true classic."
4,A must read for anyone who's been asked about thier faith,"I purchased this book hoping to find some new insights that go beyond the normal Wicca 101 books. I'm about halfway through and I've found it to be very informative and thoughtful.As Witches I believe that we are all responsible for being ambassadors to the non-pagan community. When someone asks us, ""But what does it mean to be a pagan?"" We should be able to tell them in a concise manner. This book provides a well-researched history as a well as a refreshingly simple perspective on that question. It reminded me that when I chose to follow my spiritutal path, not only did I chose to worship different God/desses, but that I also changed the way I see the world and my place in it.Even if you don't plan on joining a coven or becoming a member of the pagan clergy, this book is a good resource to have on your shelf."
2,Does not deliver,"Unfortunately this book fails to deliver what it promises, as there is nothing ""advancing"" in the book whatsoever. Now that being said, it is still not a bad book. Primarily this book is a basic introduction and would be good for beginners. It contains useful ideas but presents nothing we have not seen a hundred times over in published works to date.I rated the book two stars because it misleads the reader into thinking he or she will find something of greater substance than the fluffy nonsense that has become the standard in Witchcraft/Wiccan books today."
2,Not De Lint's best,"I was expecting a fine read when I began this book, since the writer is such a good one, a master of both short stories and novels. This book was, to put it briefly, a major letdown. The pagan characters are of course one hundred percent virtuous and always manage to save the day, an example of perfect propoganda. If an author had attempted similar characters, only making them Christian or Jewish, they would be condemned for preaching, but I guess it's okay if they're Wiccan. While De Lint condemns New Age theology in this book, he presents quite a bit of it. The attempt to mix together several plots is also a failure - the first story is extremely dry, the second moderately interesting and the third average at best. Overall the attempt to mix them into one coherent book does not work and the whole comes across as very convoluted (sp?). I'd recommend Trader for anyone who wants a real taste of De Lint's writing - even fans of his should skip over this."
4,Good idea,"The idea is great, the colors are bright. Our child loves to make the art using these markers. One thing/complain is that the foam ends are not too durable. We had to order the replacements, as two of them split along the ends pretty soon after the first use. Other than that, using it a lot."
3,Not my favorite,"I like the idea of these but my 2 year-old son didn't understand how they work on as all little kids do he touched the pads, got paint on his hands and it does NOT wash off with baby wipes and even 1 soap and water use. It took most of the day for the color to come off his hands. Having taught school for 7 years i wasn't that upset I knew it would wear off eventually but I can't imagine it comes out of cloth very easily if it doesn't wash off of hands. So I would definitely recommend using a smock with these. My son liked them but didn't understand how to make the paint come out. Perhaps with more use he'll get the hang of it. Maybe more appropriate for a 4 or 5 year old. i bought these because my son loves to finger paint but was hoping for something less messy and easier to clean up. This would NOT meet that criteria.They do work exactly as described and I think for an older child they would be great."
4,Great Art Supply,"These are lots of fun - the colors are bright and so far, the ink has been washable.I will probably get the other color set as well."
5,My son loves these!,"These are so much fun! My four year old loves to make pictures with them, and they're washable. Great product!"
5,Non-toxic Made in USA,"My favorite thing about these is that I can tell they are non-toxic and safe. Even some of the paint products that claim to be non-toxic still have a bad and toxic smell. It wasn't a surprise that these are made in the US and not China. I wish I could find more craft supplies made in the US. They are also very fun. My four year old usually loses interest in painting very quickly, but not with these."
3,"Fun concept, but a little messy","These are basically oversized markers with flat, circular tips that kids can use to make dots and dot-based patterns.While these are fun for children, they are messier than normal washable markers. The red, pink, purple, and florescent colors are difficult to remove from clothing and other surfaces."
1,Snow is absent colors,"We were disappointed with this product because it originally showed this set of six and we got only 4 colors. On top of that we ordered two sets and got only one and had to call to get the second one. There was no box as originally advertized and just plastic bottles in a clear plastic bag with dry colors to mix. Overall we were not happy because of the missing 2 colors out of each set. We got red, orange, green and blue - NO YELLOW AND NO PURPLE. So no, we were not pleased with this. These were for two of our very artistic great grandsons.How do we get the two colors we are missing??????We had to rate the item and because there has been no snow we have no idea how well it works - and with missing colors, hummmmm."
5,Fun for my 3-yo boy,"My 3yo son has so much fun playing with this. The colors are bright, and it's easier for him to manage than holding a crayon or pencil. It's also better for me bec there's hardly any cleanup involved."
3,depends on the kid,I bought this for my niece because she loves arts and crafts products and my mom thought she would love them. My mom used to teach at our church's daycare and said her kids (age 2) loved using them and making pictures with them. My niece is 4 and she did not quit like the dot concept. she kept wanting to write with them as regular markers. in terms of the product itself it arrived as described. it does take awhile at first to get the ink flowing but after that it comes out fine. they do not work so well as regular markers so i think this product depends on the kid.
5,For the Classroom,"I got these to give my students another modality to learn their numbers and letters. I don't know how effective they are in that regard, but the kids love to use them and that makes me happy."
1,junk,"No instructions to tell you how to load and operate. Batteries are hard to load. Once batteries are in, the unit cannot be closed.Packaging brags abotu durability but there is a cardboard sleeve inside."
1,Don't buy this,"We bought the Hoppe's gun cleaning kit at a store and this pen light was included in the kit. Hoppe's makes great stuff to clean guns, but they were out to lunch when this light was added to their collection. The inside is a cardboard tube wrapped in foil paper. The light literally worked two times and then it quit. I can't figure out why it isn't working, but the craftsmanship is so bad, I don't know what made it work in the first place. Don't waste your money or your time with this one."
1,Please do not waste your money,"This is the most poorly engineered piece of junk I ever wasted seven bucks on. The batteries do not fit. Once you put one of the batteries in, YOU CAN NOT EVER GET IT BACK OUT. Then to top it off, after wasting time and money. it does not work. Hoppe's needs to do the right thing and recall this so their customers don't become disgusted with them."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This is a total POS waste of money. At first, it looked like a reasonable purchase. However, when you disassemble for battery replacement, you recognize what a total steaming pile it is. The guts are a foil wrapped cardboard tube that holds two AAA batteries. The light bulb sits in one end, and the rear end is the problem. Cheap metal tube holding the spring, and easily warps out of shape, making the whole thing unusable. Another fine China import."
1,A piece of crap,"This is the cheesiest bore light I have ever seen. The outside looks ok, but the inside looks like McGyver built it. When I opened it, I found a thin carboard tube wrapped in aluminum foil, and this makeshift unit doubles as a lamp socket (the bulb is simply pressed into the foil clad card board tube), battery compartment and conductor for the switch. The housing isn't long enough to contain the batteries, so it can't even be closed completely. Once I got everything in there, I wasn't surprised to see that it would only work every other time I pressed the switch, and only if I wiggled everything into a position where the crappy conductor would make contact. This light is money straight down the drain."
1,Cheap plastic crap,"I have many products from Hoppes that I use regularly, so it was an easy decision to pick this bore light when I saw it in the list of lights. I was surprised when I found that the parts didn't fit well together; the bulb is loose and held in place by a foil-covered paper tube that also goes around the batteries and conducts the current. It was difficult to make the light work and impossible to get it to stay on without constantly holding down the pocket clip that doubles as a switch. It's not worth returning so I'll keep it until it breaks, which I expect will not take long considering the quality of construction. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"How hard would it have been to take a standard flashlight design and slap a curved plastic light bender on the front. Hoppes has re-invented the wheel with this piece of crap, and the wheel has four flat sides on it. Every one star review is dead on. I'm sitting here, taking a break from cutting off the battery labels in an attempt to get them to fit in my unit. This thing is so bad, I'm taking a break simply to give this piece of crud one star. Where's the NO STAR option on this dang thing."
1,The Hoppe's Bore Light might be for you!!,If you have more money than common sense then the Hoppe's Bore Light is the product for you!!The battery holder is a cardboard tube covered in aluminum foil to complete the circuit. The light bulb just sets into one end of the cardboard tube and fell out when the batteries were inserted into the tube. To turn the light on you need to push down on the pocket clip. The tip of the clip makes contact with the aluminum foil covered cardboard and makes a dent in the foil and cardboard. The dent makes it most difficult or possible to turn the light back on again.This is a total piece of junk! Hoppe's should be ashamed for putting their name on this product .This item is by far the worst product purchased in quite sometime. I returned this item for a refund.
1,Very poor quality,"I recently had the displeasure of experiencing this bore light. As others here have said, the outside looks alright but the inside is really terrible. The batteries won't fit right, the conductor on the inside is a paper tube wrapped with aluminum foil. The light bulb is just pressed into the tube and not held securely. The case won't even close properly with the batteries inside. This has to be the worst flashlight I have ever seen. I could make something better than this out of junk I have laying around the house! If hops was giving these away I would not take one. In fact I threw the one that came in my kit away. Much more satisfying to put it where it belongs; in your local trash bin."
1,Poor quality,Two dollars would be the proper price in my opinion. Very poor quality using cardboard and very cheap plastic. China is making lots of junk that have american names on them.
1,I thought I was the only one...,"I worried that I was the only one having problems with this light, or that I was doing something wrong.I'm glad to see I was incorrect in my surmise. This thing is a total piece of junk. Doesn't assemble correctly - requires two AAA batteries, but you can't put it back together once they're in! Doesn't turn on if you can get it assembled...what a waste of finite material resources.Hoppe's ought to carefully review their relationship with the supplier that makes this light for them, because it SUCKS. Plain and simple.It's a pity Amazon does not make a zero-star review available, because this product is most deserving of one."
4,Works as advertised,"Definitely works, not nearly as blinding as the old LED one I had. Sometimes I wish it were a little brighter, but it works. The little lock feature is nice for cleaning time."
1,Junk by Hoppe's,If this is any indication of what Hoppe's will associate its Brand Name with then I will definitely be looking elsewhere for all my gun care and cleaning needs. This is an absolute piece of junk that I picked up at a gun show to inspect rifle bores. It barely made it thru the show before completely (and non-repairable) giving up the ghost. Everything said by other one star reviewers is correct and accurate.
1,Do NOT purchase - JUNK,"After receiving the first light, I returned it thinking there was some defect in that the AAA batteries did not fit. I received a prompt replacement through Amazon, and this light too did not accept the AAA batteries. I called Hoppes and talked with a service representative who said it uses lithium batteries, which are slightly smaller. I promply puchased the smallest quantity package available, which is a package of 4 for $12 plus tax. These too do not fit. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM...IT IS JUNK."
1,Hoppe's Bore Light,This was junk. I purchased this bore light and tried to insert the batteries as directed. They did not fit as a metal sleeve was too small. I sent it back. Don't buy this product and Hoppe's should discontinue their association with whatever company (probably Chinese) that manufactured it.
1,junk,Total junk. Poor design coupled with poor workmanship. It relies on a cardboard tube with aluminum foil coating as the conductor. Tube was also too short to make contact. The metal end cap that serves as a switch is supposed to fit over the last battery. It's too small to fit over the battery. I threw it out without every getting it to light up once.
1,waste of money,"Cheap plastic, terrible design, and didn't work. Very very unhappy with this product. im going to stick with hoope's other GOOD products."
1,Trash,"takes 2 aaa batteries, mine is shorter than 2 aaa batteries by 1/2"". I did get mine to light-up but it took both hands so there's no way I could use it on a gun. waste of money!"
1,Do not buy this piece of junk!!!,"Amazon really should give an option for zero stars. Hoppes should be absolutely embarassed by this 'product' and it should immediately be removed from their inventory. Other reviewers are correct in that the product design is a complete failure. I did manage to install the batteries; however, the light has only worked 4 times out of over 60 attempts. The 4 'successes' involved tweaking atound the components. Reviews on other consumer sites (Cabelas, Bass Pro Shops, etc.) mirror exactly the reviews on Amazon: Absolute rubbish. This might actually be the single worst product I have ever purchased."
1,Hoppe's Bore Light,"I agree with the other reviews - this is a product to avoid. But, if you have one as I do, the removable 90 end can be installed on a good quality pen light giving you a usable tool with brighter white light."
1,"Don't buy, it's faulty",I love poker so I bought this for those times when I have time on my hands. This thing is either programmed incorrectly or has a manufacturing defect. At the end of a hand it shows the other players and calls out a pair or some such other hand that does not exist.The graphics are nice but with those roaring defects in logic why bother? There are other games of this genre that do work. Save your money.
1,ABSOLUTE RIP OFF!!!,Toys'N'Tech sold me this item for $135 when the actual retail price from Air Hogs was $35. When the unit broke after a few months they denied any responsibility. They will not respond to emails. THIS IS NOT A GOOD COMPANY TO BUY FROM.
3,Not great,"The beans didn't appear to be fresh. They were dry. No oily sheen. The bags they come in seem thin, and can't be resealed - you have to cut the top off to open them. Flavor was somewhat weak."
5,pro-life sex education!,"This book paints a wonderful picture from a CATHOLIC point of view of what God intended for love and sexuality. Appropriate for pre-adolescents to read, I would suggest all parents read it before giving it to their children. Some parts contain obvious opinions rather than Catholic doctrine, so parents need to be cautious. It stresses the importance of respect and reverence for children's own bodies, and those of the opposite sex. Perfect book for a pro-life, Catholic family who is seeking guidance on how to explain to their children about sexuality."
1,Terrible,"If you are looking for an account of the complex chain of events, discoveries and philosophies leading to the emergence of the modern scientific worldview, this is the wrong book. It is heavily influenced by post-modernist views, whereas science is seen as a ""discourse"" no more or less valid than ""alternative"" modes of knowledge. Since this is plainly incorrect, the book fits the facts to the Procustean bed of ""theory"" to support its thesis. For instance, never is the book is the development of Calculus mentioned, clearly an essential step in the development of classical mechanics and the foundation of most modern scientific theories. The same may be said for countless other developments which are cavalierly ignored. There was a scientific revolution and its effects are all around us, including the medium on which this review is written."
2,High hopes - not fulfilled,"I was really looking forward to reading this book after several warm recommendations, but I was sadly disappointed. The contents was reasonable giving, but the language and the presentation...I give it..4 for contents,2 for language and grammar,2 for presentation and structure.Hmmm. 8 divided by 3 is... 2.6. No, that's more than it deserves."
4,A thoughtful examination of science history.,"Shapin opens his 'Scientific Revolution' with the paradoxical statement, ""there was no such thing as the Scientific Revolution, and this is a book about it."" Shapin proceeds to use the next 150 or so pages to explain himself. The book is firmly structured in three sections, addressing the what, how, and why of scientific knowledge in the seventeenth century; the contents of each section are similarly well-structured, but seem to discuss more than the simple titles suggest. Examining the very foundations of scientific thought and the manner in which the modern distinction between legitimate science and voodoo came about, Shapin uses the Scientific Revolution as a venue for introducing his and other scholars' views on both the essential nature of modern science and the way in which ideas evolve. Explanatory notes where appropriate make the reading accessible to those unfamiliar with science history or philosophy."
3,Edifying,"An interesting book about the Scientific Revolution that didn't happen (according to the author). After reading it, I have to say I agree with him. Unfortunately, I never warmed up to the author's writing style. It has three long chapters. Shapin explains what was known back in the 1700s, how it was known and what knowledge was for. He pretty much knocks secular humanists off their pedestal without ever really addressing them."
4,Indeed a concise history!,"A scholarly concise history of India would best describe this book. It is well illustrated with numerous black and white photographs. An ideal book if you want a quick read on India and its history right from its origins. Though I have a 1979 edition published in 1991, the history 'ends' in the seventies. Despite this, Mr Watson has captured a fairly lucid panaromic view of Indian history spanning many centuries. He has documented the key events and milestones in Indian history and therefore the book serves the need of most who want key and basic information without detailed narration and evaluation. The writing style is simple and easy to read. Even young teenagers would be able to read and understand the flow of events especially the arrival and development of different cultures. Recommended reading especially for FBIs (foreign born Indians) who want to know more about their origins or be better able to relate to relatives and friends still on the Indian sub-continent!"
3,WRITERS NOT ON THE SAME PAGE,"Chloe ages with no explanation. Angel all but disappears. They out right copy ""Silence of the Lambs"" after ""Jack s captured, even to the point of stealing a line right from the movie. Sam remians insecure and unable to carry on an adult conversation. Malone's daughter disappers after we have watched two seasons of family struggles."
1,beware of this seller,"I ordered Profiler, Seasons 3 and 4. I received the package in the mail today. Instead of the items that I ordered, I received 2 used library books. Amazon sent me a return label for the items (the library books!) so that I could send them back to receive a refund. Fingers crossed that I receive the refund!"
3,...,"A decent book, with some interesting arguments.However, if you are open minded, then i would suggest ""The Case for Christ"", or if you are willing to delve deeply into this subject then ""The New Evidence that Demands a Verdict"" by Josh McDowell as supplements to this book."
4,Non Sequitur,"Kim wakes up one morning to find himself on Earth with his girlfriiend Libby and working at Starfleet headquarters. He is very skeptical and goes to work passing by a coffee shop where a man gives him some coffee and says he's been going there for a couple of years everyday. Trying to figure out what happens, he locates Tom Paris in France and discovers that he's a washed up drunk guilty of helping the Maquee. Starfleet command thinks he is a maquee infiltrator and attaches a security link to him. Paris comes around and decides to help him. Along with the aid of the coffee shop guy(who is an alien) he escapes earth and tries to find a way to restore the way things were. But can he do it before a starfleet vessel destroys him?"
1,Boring!,"I bought this episode because it sounded interesting. It really fell flat. It's slow-moving, and the solution is confusing. I didn't like how we didn't see the rest of the crew at all until the end. I guess I don't like Harry Kim enough to put up with just him for an entire episode!"
4,Wonderful book!,"My 16-month old twins love this book. They love kissing each animal. On the last page the book asks what kisses do you like best. I always say ""Mommy kisses"" and kiss them all over."
4,Touch-and-feel with a twist,"Simple touch and feel book with a twist - it's a ""kiss"" and feel. Not really one of those books that you want to buy used or pass on, but worth the small investment. My two boys loved this one as toddlers. There is something very fun and silly about kissing velvety cow noses and rubbery fish lips."
5,A great book for your baby-any age,"This is a very attractive book with big colorful pictures, and touch and feel designs. My 3 month old baby loves it, so will yours."
2,"never say ""uncle""","Disappointed when I got to a very thick page. It is a pig that should make a sound. It doesn't always make noise. It must be squeezed in exactly a certain spot to make any sound and when it does it is a squeak not an oink. Older infants and toddlers would enjoy the pages, each has a different texture. However, because of this unnecessary sound page, they would more than likely need adult help."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book for my soon-to-be-born nephew.First off, the book arrived with the squeaker broken. Second, the book's material is not drool and mouth-proof - my 2-year-old bookworm would make mincemeat out of it in no time. Third, the text is very uninspiring and the cutouts to 'touch' are quite small for little fingers which don't have much dexterity.I am returning the book due to the broken squeaker but have asked for a refund instead of a replacement, I will find something more captivating than this book for my nephew. It is not worth the expensive price tag."
3,Not one of her favorites,"Maybe I need to pull it out again now that she's interested in animal sounds, but so far my daughter has been so-so on this book. She gets frustrated with it because the pages stick together and you have to press the pig's nose just right to get it to squeak. Actually, you have to HIT it in the right place to get it to squeak. She never seemed keen on touching the different textures either, except for the bear."
2,Book gets boring quick,"I wrote a review earlier about how great this book is, but this book gets boring quick. My little girl was interested for about two days, now she would rather read the touch and feel animal books."
5,My daughter's favorite book,"My 15 month old daughter always brings me this book to read to her. She prefers interactive books (touch-and-feel, lift-a-flap) and that continues with this one. The bright and colorful pictures of this boardbook really capture her eye. The book has a scratchy cat kiss, a sticky dog kiss, a velvety cow kiss, a fuzzy bear kiss, a rubbery fish kiss and a squeeky pig kiss. The textures are great. She has enjoyed it so much that I am ordering it for a one year old's birthday gift."
4,Get what you expect.,"Sturdy board pages. 5 animals, each with the texture of its ""kiss"". A toddler-delighting squeak sound when you press the pages. Don't expect too much, and you won't be disappointed. Overall, my 1.5 years all enjoys leafing through it, saying the animal's names and the sounds they make, and pressing it to hear it squeak."
4,trinity charm pendant,"This charm was very nice. It was as described. From looking at the picture, I had the impression that it was more three dimensional than it actually was. In reality, it was more flat & not as solid/heavy as it looked in the picture. (That's the only reason for the 4 stars as opposed to 5 stars.) Despite that, I'm happy with this purchase. Also, it was delivered in a timely manner. I had no complaints about that either."
1,Beware of online Jewelry Purchases,"This is my fault for believing or imagining what I am seeing in picture.When it arrived it was nothing but a metal stamped piece of jewelry and it wasn't what I would call ""Solid"" gold.I will limit my jewelry purchases to items I am sure of in the future."
3,Disappointed mostly at my oversight. this thing is tiny,"I was looking to replace a larger version of this monkey for my 39 pound shiba/pitbull/shepherd mix but didn't read close enough on the description. This thing is only about 1inch x 2 inches in size, weighing less than 1 oz. he'd probly choke on it before he could play with it. and for a price of ~$3 with more than double that in shipping, this toy is pretty much a joke. at least offer free shipping or something. this thing could easily fit in a small padded envelope. But mostly, i'm just disappointed at my own oversight hence 3 stars rather than 2.The larger one is very nice though especially since it is shipped directly from amazon.com and if you're like me with the amazon prime account, shipping is free so for the same price (about $8), you can either get this tiny choke toy, or a bigger one (approx 3x8in)."
3,One of DS9's more entertaining episodes.,"The Way of the Warrior was a 90-minute episode that introduced Worf (Michael Dorn) from The Next Generation to Deep Space Nine. For that alone, it feels pretty gimmicky. The rest of the story focuses on growing hostilities between the Federation and the Klingons, which culminates to what it is, quite simply, one of the best battle scenes in Trek history. The space battle is massive and epic, and the Klingon parties that board DS9 lead to thrilling phaser fights and exciting, very well-choreographed hand-to-hand combat. This battle scene alone makes the episode stand out from the rest of the pack."
4,Well worth the time and money.,"As a beginning classical actor, this book was well worth the time and money. The section on 'thou vs you' alone justifies the book."
5,"Singable, Likeable Recording!","This is a singable, likeable and fun recording! An inviting mix of 16 children's songs to brighten the day. Easy-to-learn lyrics, catchy tunes and beautiful rounds make this recording perfect for the classroom, family gatherings, or trips in the car. Lyrics are enclosed in the decorative CD booklet. You and your kids will love it."
2,Not Very Enjoyable,"I have to admit that my children and I only listened to a few songs of this CD. Then we turned it off and listened to Oy Baby!, which we liked better. The songs on this CD can only be described as ""corny."" The singing quality is poor and not much better than my singing. There are other ways to teach kids Jewish songs than by listening to this CD. In fact, the CD only made me wonder why Jewish children CDs cannot be better quality considering there are so many wonderful Jewish singers and cantors."
3,"Not a ""must see"", but good enough","This episode of Star Trek Voyager is okay, but I wouldn't exactly call it one of the better episodes of Season One of the show.Here, the Voyager crew encounters an alien race who may have the technology to get them home, the the aliens are unwilling to help. Instead, they are more interested in the entertainment that the Voyager crew can provide through their stories of the Alpha Quadrant.Certainly an interesting turnabout commentary on the effects of the prime directive...but I wouldn't call this episode a ""must see"" for the typical viewer. If you are a hard-core Trek fan, however, it's certainly worth a look."
1,don't waste your money .....set is a rip off......,Buying them one at a time will save you money. Most of these movies now sell for under $15 each the only one worth some money is 101 dalmations because it is out of print. Otherwise this set is way over priced...
2,not washable,"my 2 yr old loved stamping with these, but when he was done we started to clean up and he had ink stains left all over his hands, he is not a big fan of dirty hands, so he was not pleased."
3,It's okay.,"These are okay, but the ink definitely isn't as great as I thought it would be. It looks very thin and isn't as bright as I was expecting. Still a lot of fun though."
1,Stains! DO NOT BUY! NOT WASHABLE,"This will act like a dye and spread from one little drip even from a dry picture. Will not even come off Child's skin depending on the color. Will bleed and bleed and bleed, but never come out. BE CAREFUL! NOT WASHABLE!"
5,another great do a dot prduct,My three year old loves do-a-dot. These colors are as vivid and bright as promised. I think I may like these a bit more than the shimmer colors but all do a dot are great quality. They are also made in the USA which makes me comfortable letting the 18 month old experiment with them too.
2,More china junk,"Brand new out of the box and it doesn't even work. It makes a high pitch sound like the batteries were ran down or something, but brand new ones were put in. When will I learn to quit buying this junk from China."
4,NOLIMIT,"Soulja slim came back hard. This cd sounds like a nolimit cd from 97,98. It is hard core and tight to def. The beats are off the chain. The only weak spot is in the middle of the album where the beats cool off, but heat back up at the end once again.NOLIMIT Still run the south, and soulja slim is the realest rapper from the magnolia that i have heard. Peep this cd out if you like rap from the dirty south."
2,Come On now,"Yo I used to buy every No Limit CD back in tha days, but I don't know what ya'll are talkin about, this Cd did not come through. The first Slim was hella tight, but this was pretty garbage. They lost too many people, and probably the most important was Beats by the pound, now known as medicine men. Face it ya'll NO LIMIT IS DONE, FINISHED. IT'S OVER."
5,SouLja Slim # 1,This cd is the best SouLja Slim came hard on this cd since he been locked up that foo cam with songer lyrics. I love this cd so damn much Slim is tha best in my book. Much Luv keep the tank rollin. The song I really luv was MAKE IT HAPPEND thats the best song with EZELL on the beat and Krazy rips it at the end that boy is raw 2.
4,a classic,mane one day i was online looking at some c-murder stuff and this soulja slim junt pull up and i have never heard anythang about it so i check it out and love it im late but still it a must go get
3,Young Honey,Over all the movie is fine. Many lovely half naked women to look at. The plot is a little slow. The best part in my opinion is Barbara Alyn Woods.
2,Dance with death,"A fair movie for a slasher, which I generally don't like. I originally got this video because of one of the cast-Cat Sassoon. She plays the part of a exotic dancer-she does have the body for it who unfortunately gets killed off by the middle of the movie. Unfortunately she does not do any martial arts in this movie. Basically the plot is a little sparse but the dancers are cute. I'll probably watch it a second time but it's nowhere near Angel Fist."
4,Maravilloso single,"""Pipes of peace"" es un disco maravilloso,pero que ha envejecido muy mal.Es el típico cliché de los 80,s con el sonido 80,s latiendo por todas partes.Todo demasiado pulcro.Aún así,sacamos fácilmente cinco o seis magníficas canciones.La que da título al album es aparte.Esta es uno de los mayores logros en la carrera de McCartney.Nada falta o sobra en esta cancion,todo encaja,en perfecta proporcion.La intro es una preciosidad,el ritmo,la letra..todo.Una de las cimas de su autor.El resto del disco tiene momentos muy buenos-""Say,say,say""-y otros menos logrados-""Average person"".Otro de sus problemas es tener como precedente al excelso ""Tug of war"",para muchos el segundo mejor album de McCartney.Personalmente prefiero los últimos esfuerzos,por su cambio de sonido y su mayor variedad(""Driving rain""),pero este es un muy buen disco."
3,Give Pipes Of Peace A Chance,"Paul's 1983 release was savaged by critics and largely ignored by the public - it probably didn't help that this was released after the masterpiece ""Tug Of War"". This album is comprised mostly of leftovers (Wings guitarist Laurence Juber recalled rehearsing much of this material) but there are some catchy tunes. The title track, the ""Say Say Say"" duet with Michael Jackson, and ""So Bad"", which was reprised in ""Give My Regards To Broad Street."" I really like ""Sweetest Little Show"" and ""Average Person"", but even help from old friends Ringo Starr and producer George Martin doesn't bring this up to Paul's potential. Some enjoyable lightweight pop tunes, but not much to write home about. Maybe not deserving of the critical gouging it got, but then again I'm one of those who buys anything with Macca's name on it, so you decide."
3,Beatle & King of Pop collaborate,"Pipes Of Peace is a decent collection of songs. There are two duets with Michael Jackson, the monster hit ""Say Say Say"" which is a bouncy piece of ear candy that spent six weeks at number one and is Mr. McCartney's last chart topper and lesser known, but still good ""The Man"". ""So Bad"" is a good mid-tempo song with Mr. McCartney affecting a high falsetto. The title track is the best song on the album. It is a perfect piece of pop production that only George Martin could oversee. Unfortunately, the rest of album is throwaway material that is mostly forgettable."
3,Has its moments,"It's tough to follow up any great album (see the Eagles following up Hotel California with Long Run) and in most instances, the follow up album comes up short. That is the case with Pipes of Peace. It falls far short of the outstanding Tug of War.The album is uneven. There are some really good songs such as The Other Me, So Bad, Sweetest Little Show, Keep Under Cover, and The Average Person (with former Wing bandmate Denny Laine singing background vocals). However, both Mike Jackson duets are lame, Tug of Peace and Hey Hey are very forgettable, Through our Love is sappy, and the title track is a bit boring.For true McCartney fans only. For the casual McCartney fan, look to Tug of War for early 80's McCartney music."
2,Average But The King Of POP gives The Album it's Stars,"Folks are Just Mad that Michael Jackson The King Of PoP Outshines their Hero On His Own Album.Say,Say,Say is a great song.and The Remixes are Tight&Slammin'.The Man is a Alright song.even Stanley Clarke The Great Bass Player is on this Album but he can't save it Either.Mccartney has too Many 2nd-rate songs on here.But THE KING OF POP Maintains His GENIUS Here.George Martin Only Shines on a few tracks here.Perhaps Quincy Jones could Have Helped Paul?"
2,Michael Jackson and Paul: an unfortunate matchup,"It would not be until the 00 decade that Paul would put out two consecutive albums of originals that were worthy of his talent. `Tug of War' had looked promising, with a few Beatlesworthy keepers like `Ballroom Dancing' and `Here Today'. But there's nothing but kids stuff and tweenager fare on this follow-up. For adults there's not much of anything, certainly not the duets with eventual Beatles-catalogue-thief Michael Jackson, about as ideal a friend as Heather Mills would be a wife. This album was bad enough but worse was to come. The abyss of `Give My Regards to Broad Street' and `Press to Play' was yawning, as were we all. Who would have thought he would EVER crawl out from under, but he did."
3,Give PIPES OF PEACE a chance,"Add Paul McCartney's PIPES OF PEACE to the list including TUG OF WAR, RED ROSE SPEEDWAY, FLOWERS IN THE DIRT, VENUS AND MARS, LONDON TOWN, BACK TO THE EGG and MCCARTNEY - albums I find either over-rated or, in this case, under-rated. PIPES OF PEACE includes the smash ""Say Say Say,"" the superb minor hit ""So Bad,"" and the rollicking ""Sweetest Little Show""/""Average Person"" medley, all candidates for a best-of collection. Another two or three tracks are very good. Released in 1983, PIPES OF PEACE was the start of a popularity decline for Paul McCartney, but to hear this album you would wonder why."
3,"yes, but George Martin produced it.","Definitely a let-down coming off Tug of War, but still a sterling production job by George Martin. Granted he didn't have McCartney's strongest songs to work with, but, compare this to the thin-sounding Venus and Mars, and see which is truly a richer listening experience.I'm not a Michael Jackson fan, nor a fan of McCartney's really ""contempory pop"" stuff, but, though Say, Say, Say has that 80's sound, it's still a very strong production effort by George Martin. It was Martin's production, not the strength of the song, that made it a month and a half long #1 hit. I agree with other reviews that this is a slick ""contempory pop"" effort rather than being a wonderful mix of rockers, appealing pop-rock numbers and heart felt ballads, which had all been McCartney's strengths in the past. But, it is far from his worst."
2,Pretty Mediocre,"Pretty dissapointing after the far superior Tug of War. I like Keep Under Cover and Average Person, but the rest lacks passion and spark. McCartney is such a huge talent that I often am mystified as to why he sometimes lacks vision and doesn't understand his appeal to so many people. That being passionate rockers and catchy and moving melodies, NOT pop drivel!"
3,Pop,"The title implies a sort of companion album to the more successful ""Tug of War"" album, but this nevertheless contains the classics ""Say Say Say"" and ""So Bad,"" the latter being especially moving somehow. The others are well-produced as usual, if not always the most inspired."
2,Could have been better....,"Not a bad album, but not great. Say Say Say, So Bad, The Other Me, and Tug of Peace are highlights. Rest of album is mediocre. I would recommend All The Best, Tug of War, Give My Regards to Broad Street, or Flowers in the Dirt for better '80's McCartney albums. Also throw in Press To Play (1986) if you can find it. For the rest of his career, Flaming Pie, McCarntey, and Band on the Run immediately spring to mind. Skip this one for a latter purchase."
2,I gave it two stars cause its Paul but...,"This is my least favorite McCartney album and I am one big-time fan who would buy a record of him belching if he released it :-) The unfortunate Michael Jackson songs (Say Say Say, The Man and The Girl is Mine) are beyond awful and I am embarrassed for Paul when I hear the latter. Thank God he didn't write it is all I can say!Anyways, I would buy it for the two GREAT songs on it--Through Our Love and the title track. The rest is just not Paul's best stuff. Better to buy Tug of War if you want his best 80's music... Flaming Pie for his 90's and Driving Rain for the millenium!"
1,Paul is WAY better than this one,"Paul is definitely a big talent and I enjoy almost every album of his including those with the Beatles. But, this one is just too difficult to listen to. His previous album, Tug of War, was sooo good and this to follow was a major let down. A couple of good songs but not worth the price."
3,Pipes Is A Mediocre Affair,"About the best thing that can be said about this album is that it is ""pleasant"". Coming after the brilliant ""Tug Of War"", ""Pipes Of Peace"" is a disappointment of sorts. For starters, Paul's collaborative trilogy with Michael Jackson ends miserably with ""Say, Say, Say"" and ""The Man"". ""Hey Hey"" is essentially music to breakdance to and actually sounds as though it's a cast-off from ""McCartney II"". ""So Bad"" is Paul trying to sound like Michael Jackson (similar to ""Girlfriend"" on ""London Town"") and is insufferably syrupy. The best songs, ""Pipes Of Peace"", ""Keep Under Cover"" and ""Average Person"" rescue the album and keep it from becoming an exercise in self-indulgent fluff. Not bad, but not great either."
3,It's not THAT bad!,"Simply put, many are extremely disappointed with this album. As a long time Macca fan, I will admit it is not one of his best and is probably one of his 5 worst albums. Like in literally all of Macca's albums, however, Macca definitely shows his brilliance at least on several occasions. There are a couple of very good if not great songs (Pipes of Peace and Say Say Say), an array of average songs (The Man, Sweetest Little Show), and two below average Macca tunes (Hey Hey, Pipes of Peace). The bonus songs (if your version has bonus songs) are definitely a plus. Simple as That and Twice in a Lifetime are nothing special, but are enjoyable. We All Stand Together is very Disney-like and is very enjoyable and well done, if you don't mind cutesy, children songs. All in all, Pipes of Peace is nothing great, but delivers some pop entertainment."
1,I'd go lower if I could,"I am writing this review nearly 20 years after purchasing this insipid album of Paul's. I threw it away years ago when I was moving, and I still feel a flush in my face when I think that I actually spent over 10 hard earned dollars to purchase my final vinyl from McCartney. Listening to a song about a lion tamer made me cringe at the time, and I still hope I run into Paul someday so I can shake him down for a refund (adusted for inflation of course). If this album were a flavor, it would be vanilla with salmonella; what isn't bland, makes you feel sick to your stomach. Don't buy this unless you the kind of fanatical McCartney collector who would buy the liner notes to his tax forms."
2,THE LOW POINT,"This is the last mc cd I got now I have replaced al my lp's. why was this my last, well this was a low point for Mc the songs in the most part are weak at best.... yes a few were good, but most were soft. M jackson was Mc's down fall and mccartney is still trying to reach 1# one after all these year's.Don't get me wrong I'm a true Mccartney fan, and have all his stuff and his stuff after this mess should have reached high on the charts. It took the wind from him. Rock on Paul!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!."
3,It's not so bad,This isn't nearly as good an effort fromPaul as Tug of War but it still worksand Linda's intonation is still good...it's a better than average McCartneyAlbum... three stars is good
2,Great designs BUT............,"I enjoy the designs in this book a lot. These are some of the most original houses and cottages I have seen . I do, however, have one serious beef with this book. The patterns that require different sections to be joined are presented as one piece only. That means you have to make several copies of the whole unit to get the various pieces to put together. This may be a bit confusing to understand in print so I'll explain further . If you've read ""Quilts with Style"" magazine, you'll notice that the quilts/wallhangings have individual piece patterns for you to copy and begin piecing. This book has a format much different than that.I teach paper piecing and I know that it would be very confusing for non advanced piecers to know how to replicate the pieces. I believe ""That Patchwork Place"" was just trying to save more money on printing this book. They sacrificed ease of use to have less pages.If the patterns had been presented appropriately, I would have given it 5 stars."
3,Hokey kitcsh but a lot of fun!,"If you can ignore the fact that most of the kids could not sing, especially in the jarringly painful Charlotte's Web, this is a fun album. Most of the songs are very upbeat and bouncy. The album well captures the optimistic corniness of the show. Those appreciating the irony will laugh and sing along despite themselves."
5,Great Music sung by Brady Kids,"I absolutely loved this CD. It was fantastic. It was like going back in time to when I was a child and heard the Brady Kids sing these songs on The Brady Bunch. It had excellent sound quality, the Brady Kids are excellent singers, and this CD is a ""real keeper."""
4,Awesome Flash Back!!,I was excited to learn that a CD was made with various songs from the Brady Bunch. I enjoy the show and now that I can hear those cute songs I heard as kid at my convenience makes me happy. The CD has many of the songs they sang on the show and during their variety shows. Its a great compulation of their music. If your a fan of the Brady Bunch you'll truly enjoy this CD.
4,"I wish the Brady Bunch would ""Keep On"" making great cds .","My sister got me this cd and I love it. MY favorite song is Keep On, I keep on singing and playing this song all day long. This is the best cd ever."
3,Period pieces,"Barry Williams and Maureen McCormick could sing, and the others could not, but they all had to be included in these attempts to rival the Partridge family. Actually, the Bradys had the better TV show, and David Cassidy had better albums. But hey, this is *fascinating* stuff, especially for those fond of this era."
3,Corny but fun,"I loved the Brady Bunch as a kid. Tuesday nights -- what a night for kids' TV! Brady Bunch at 8:00 followed by Partridge Family at 8:30. This album has the best of their musical numbers. It's wholesome (albeit hokey) entertainment. The Bradys actually do an admirable job (and who can deny that Florence Henderson has a wonderful singing voice?)I have observed that on this site, usually it seems that anytime anyone likes an album, they rate it a five-star classic. Well, this is a fun album, but I certainly won't go THAT far, for pete's sake! I mean, something like the Beatles' ""Revolver"" album or Dylan's ""Highway 61 Revisited"" are fantastic albums from gifted artists that changed the face of popular music, and are bona fide 5-star classics. Um, don't think the Brady Bunch quite had the same impact. But I guess I shouldn't critique the critics. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions."
4,So Bad It's Brilliant!,"I used to watch The Brady Bunch every Fri. night at 7:00. I thought it was a pretty hip show back then. The bigest problem the Bradys ever had was loosing their dog Tiger, or Jan not being popular enough. Imagine if the show was on the air today; Jan pregnant, Bobby on dope, Greg wrestling with homosexual feelings. Yes, the Brady Bunch is a time capsule for an era that is gone for good- and this little album reflects that weird 70's 'zeitgeist' in a frightening way.This record is so cheezy and wholesome it will almost make you sick- and hell, there's a kinda campy charm to that."
5,Body slammin' fist pumpin' rock n roll!!!!,"This album kicks some serious bottom brother. 'Truckin' on back to you' will have you headbanging against your Flower Power poster. 'Sunshine Day' the Brady's biggest hit will make you feel invincible when played at full blast. You swear you can jump off the top of a building and laugh as you hit the ground and walk away. With the unquestionable vocal talents of Eve Plum and Barry Williams, this collection of solid gold hits will make you the hero of any party.Rock on Brady's. I'm still awaiting the reunion tour."
5,Excellent Funimation version,Also known as Duel of The Flying Fist.Excellent tranfer quality. Probably better than the Ivl version if anything.English audio is a tad mute (volume needs to be turned up half way for you to hear it great) but it's consistent not like the Invincible Shaolin DVD (reviewed). It's the original english dubbing from it's hey-day with an alternate music soundtrack. No Ric Flair music. :( Chinese audio is great with coherent subtitles.No extras other than the same trailers like the previous releases of Ichi and so forth.Overall: 8/10
2,Not happy with purchase,"Although the movie is decent, the quality of the dvd is not, it has problems with sudden freezes at times, que quality of the picture is below standards and the ending of the movie is cutoff so there's no ending scene. A very dissapointing dvd."
2,This is NOT Duel Of The Iron Fist,"Do not be fooled by the change of title, this is NOT Duel Of The Iron Fist...not entirely.The VHS version of this classic film is called Duel Of The Shaolin Fist, and is edited for TV, minus much of the fight scenes, especially the final one. It's at least in wide screen, which is a plus. It clocks in at 90 minutes.This DVD version clocks in at 98 minutes, but is full screen (meaning that we get to miss the sides of it all, including half their faces, at times). In addition, the ending is once again cut out of the film.When will we be able to get the full-length, uncut version, in glorious wide screen? I doubt that I'll live long enough to see it again.Awful work on this fantastic film. Don't waste your money."
2,poor choice,"I went to get this movie cause i remembered it from the 70s...but it was done very poorly, and ending was cut off, so i had to get the better , full version ""the Duel"". I tell ya , the version ""duel of the Iron Fist "" is awful, and looks like it was recorded off an old cable channel . The picture is fuzzy , and it just looks very , very , cheaply done. Most of all ,and i say again, the ending is cut off! If you want the movie , please get ""The Duel"" insted."
3,not bad for an early kung fu flick,"Duel of the Iron Fist was made and released before Bruce Lee took the world by storm, so the fight choreography in this movie is not the best, not saying that it is the worst either. Bruce Lee would later provide the formula for martial arts choreography. Duel of the Iron Fist is still worth viewing. The story is great, the acting is great and the fights are entertaining. It stars both David Chiang and Ti Lung, who are 2 of the better actors in Kung-Fu Cinema and it's directed by my favorite martial arts director Chang Cheh. So if you love old school Shaw Brothers than view this flick, if your'e expecting something like Jackie Chan or Jet Li, look elsewhere"
4,And moagnetic base !,"The level does what is supposed to, and best of all, without the magnetic base, it doesn't collect magnetic debris that can scratch finished surfaces."
2,How to kill your descendents...,"In a strange temporal anomaly the Defiant lands on a planet that is populated with their descendents, Sisko realises that this planet is somehow out of loop with the rest of time and that they are in the future and that the reason these descendents are alive is that the Defiant was trapped on the planet decades earlier and never escaped, with all the original crew dead, except for Odo, the crew face a difficult situation: if they leave the planet then the crew will not pro-create with each other and create the descendents they see before them. In effect they will be killing their descendents, even though they haven't been born in their time. Confusing - well not when it is explained to you with the magic of TV, but slow, YES. Not much happens except a lot of bonding with the crews relatives-to-be. A bit boring especially as we all know the ending, the Defiant IS going to leave and thus ensuring that the descendents never exist. Well we never liked them anyway..."
4,Fruit looks into the soul,"""Fruit"" was a wonderful reading experience for me. The story unfolds in such a way that you are taken into this man's inner world. He has a strong hatred of self that seems to be inflicted on him by outside sources. He carries the hatred too far, killing two gay men. When he realizes that this is his own spirit he kills, he must then face more than a trial for murder. The characters are rich and finely detailed. The language of the book is rich and succinct. The author has a gift of story telling. The spiritual qualities of the characters haunt. Why is it called ""Fruit""? Congdon retells a Native American legend in this book. It is through the understanding of the orchard that we begin to understand who and where we are in the universe."
5,"Nice set of knives. Cheap, Sharp, Fun","These are of course a little different from the usual western kitchen knives. But I find I like to use them quite a lot. The santoku is almost a replacement for my chef's knife, the Nakiri allows me to cut thinner veggie slices quickly, and the yanagiba is handy for cutting meat and fish thinly.They are traditional Japanese knives, made with a much thinner cutting edge and blade, and using steel that is hard but rust prone if left wet. Wipe dry after use, never put in dishwasher -- as the package warns. The handles are bare white wood, so I stained and varnished the handles, because I knew they would pick up food stains otherwise. They seem to hold an edge well, I hone them once a week or so.All in all a good bargain."
4,Good knives,"Knives received are as advertised. First impression of the knives went well, and so did the second, third and etc. Knives are nice and sharp out of the box, and cut very nicely. I will be sharpening them up some more."
3,ringer volume,"Under features description it states, ""You can select loudness of each ringer."" I did not find that to be true. On the four phones that I received there is a single on-off switch for ringer control not the individaul volume control as indicated under the features description. I will be retruning the phones. If I didn't need the individual volume control the phones would be satisfactory and a good value for the low price."
4,Good but not as good as the 1st suffering,I really did enjoy playing this game it was fun and full of action but it was not really as good or as freaky as the the 1st suffering the game was awesome u should play this case it is fun but the 1st is way better buy both and give it a try
3,wont play a second time,"i bought this game after playing the first suffering. the first one was fantastic and the storyline kicked butt. this one was ok but the story line was a little confusing and not at all what i expected. depending on how you finished the first one (good evil or neutral ending) this game didnt make sense. it only made sense if you finished the first with the evil ending which was disapointing to me.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
2,Dissapointment,"I was huge fan of the first game. The Suffering was my favorite game on the PS2 and I have never been so freaked out by a video game. I anxiously waited for the sequel and pre orderd it. What a let down! The story is thin. The setting is thin. While the first game made you believe a prison Island could be totally haunted, it;s hard to believe the same as much about Baltimore. Anyone whos ever been to Baltimore knows there is alot scarier things there than ghosts. Then alot of things are thrown in the game that didnt necesarily coincide with the original story. Then the bugs. The game was rushed. The bugs dont just ruin the game play experience, they, at points switch off the entire game on my console."
3,Pretty good game,"Cool graphics with some neat looking monsters. Story line wasnt the greatest, but it might just be me...plus, I didnt play the first game in the series. Maybe that would have made the story line more interesting and understandable. Otherwise, the game gave me a reasonable amount of play time to conclude it and it was fun. Even scared me a couple times! Good game for $15 or less."
1,stuck...,"I was, and still am a huge fan of suffering. I just wish my ties that bind game (ps2) would stop freezing up at the end of certain battles. Twice now I have had to start over at my last save to try to continue in the game. I don't have any cheats activated, so I'm not sure what's up?? I did read a few other reviews with the same problem...any solutions, besides starting all over?...I'm about half way through the game."
1,Change the title! How to screw up a game in one easy lesson!,"A million glitches and freezes, no way to figure out or complete any ending, a complete struggle all the way. No pc cheats or hints anywhere on the web. This game sucks plain and simple. Got all the way to the end and couldn't get the game to finish. Piece of c rap!!"
1,RENT ... DON'T BUY!,"Would have been a great game and worth the price had Midway worked out all the bugs before rushing to get it to market.Graphics and storyline a little above average, but game is constantly locking up and freezing, making gameplay nearly impossible even for those who are not easily frustrated.Don't make the same mistake I did, and read ALL the feedback online regarding the many complaints about this game's ""bugs"" and ""freezing"" problems (on ALL platforms) before wasting your money!"
2,Real forget the sales,"This album despite its line up, is a flaw. If you wanna get his best works don't buy there are roughy 2 good songs on the album. SO DOWNLOAD EM if gotta have it."
2,You get what you pay for . . .,"I've purchased this item twice now, so I have 40 of these puppies. They seemed good at first; hey digital is digital. And I like the bulk packaging without all those hard case and paper liners. However, I started noticing a number of dead spots in my recordings. Earlier recordings that where perfection at the outset now seem to have gaps and holes. And though it's said that you can erase and re-record 1000 times, in my experience if you try to edit and record again errors appear. An experience yesterday really frustrated me. After recording a group of songs, and spending time titling, I got the dread UTOC error. NOthing you can do at that point but throw it away. Actually I broke the case open and let my cat play with the little disk inside. In my experience Memorex products have always been third rate."
1,Low Quality,I bought a pack of these and although I have had no problems writing and playing them they do have a tendency to jam in the recorder. Seems to be the slinding door. I would recomment Sony's or TDK's Pay the difference and possibly prevent damage to your machine.
2,you get what you pay for,These are nothing special. Buy Sony or TDK. These are inexpensive but that's because they're cheaply made.
2,To many failures,"I bought these discs despite reading some of the negative reviews. I wish I would have listened to what those people said. I bought the discs in April and haven't had a problem until now. Maybe I hit two bad boxes, but I have had 6 discs mysteriously erase on me. I would have a full disc one second and a blank disc the next. I even tried locking the discs, but it still happened. I've went back to use some of my old rewritten SONY discs and haven't had a problem. I have a lot of the memorex still left, but I plan to only use them for things that I don't NEED to keep."
1,flimsy doors,"For cheap discs, these do the job, but don't count on them to last. Under heavy-use (everyday in & out), the metal doors get loose and bend outwards. I've actually had quite a few come that way...just loose. I now have gone through all of the discs, removed the doors, bent them into a tighter shape, replaced them and they work much better. As for the actual media, they give quite a few TOC errors and have more bad sections than desired...not too hot. I wish amazon carried Lumina, Victor, or Sony ES...those are great."
2,Mini discs are mini discs.,"When very little seperates one product from another, one must ultimately judge that product on minute detalis. And here's my gripe. Petty as it may sound, the labels keep peeling up. At first it's a minor annoyance, but when the things get stuck in the player because of the label, that's just silly. I've actually gone to the length of using labels from other mini discs. It all sounds stupid yes? But why pay money for something that displeases you? I switched to TDK, and they're a better value, and- the labels stay put!"
1,Stick with Sony or TDK,"I bought these discs because I like to collect different types. The included cases was a nice bonus too. However, the discs are poorly made, the MD casing is extremly thin and brittle and the metal shutters were slightly bent exposing the disc."
2,"Okay, i guess","These were the first discs i got, when i got into MD in 1999. ... .... .... Unfortunately, when i got other discs from sony, and TDK, i realized how bad they were. Sure, they look cool, but all MD's look cool. Where these discs really fail is quality. The sound is as good as on any other disc, but the errors are very annoying. Ive probably had an error on every other disc i tried to record on. And this happened after only the 3rd or 4th write. MD's are claimed to be eraseable over a thousand times! Well, i guess memorex's arent. These discs are really a pain to record on. You wont know you've had an error till they player tries to edit the TOC, at the end of your recording session. Then you lose everything. You're better of with some higher quality discs imported from japan. Try minidisco.com, just stay away from the hi-space they have there. Anything else there is a sure bet to be better than these memorexes."
3,Problems?,"Yes, the price is just great. With my $25 gift certificate, I can get the thing for about $8. I just test the first disc, and it went fine for the first hour. But towards the end of the disc, I start to hear BIG skipping/shuttering. It's just like playing mp3 on a busy computer. I hope that I have time to test the rest of the discs today and give it a recoomendation."
2,Memorex alright,"Memorex finally came out with different colors for their md blanks. The only reason I've ever bought them was for their price. I don't have too much complaint about memorex. Sometimes I think the MD blanks look cheap. The most useless feature of Memorex MD's are their hard to write labels. The labels cannot be easily written with pencil (which I do on a normal basis when I erase and record different mixes). Also their labels seem to peel off easily. I prefer Sony's because of their paper based labels; however, Sony's pricing doesn't make them the best buy. Sony MDs look allot better though."
1,I returned mine,"They're pretty, but I'd rather listen to them! After a short recording the first one I tried showed ""writing TOC"" for 5 minutes, I finally took out the batteries to stop it. I put in another and it twirled for a moment then displayed ""bad disk"" or some other dire message. I returned the package. I've never had a bad Sony or TDK disk. I complained to Memorex and they suggested I should clean my CD writer and try other software. I wrote back told them they answered the wrong question and never heard from them again."
3,Was sent different brand,"I cannot judge the quality of these Minidiscs, since I was sent instead JVC Crystal Green Minidiscs. The seller was ""idc appliances"". However, the JVC seem fine."
5,A NICE BONUS DISC,"I believe only 20,000 of these limited editions were pressed. I happened on one shortly after its release in 1994 at a Blockbuster Music store and it's been one of my favorite CD's ever since. ""Very"" was of course a brilliant album, and ""Relentless"" is equally as brilliant. True, not many vocals are present - but it is lush, breathtaking music with a true electronic feel. I remember a sticker on the package when I bought it said ""Contains 6 bonus tracks from the forthecoming dance album"". It makes me wonder if this was a selection of new songs from a new album, that later fell through? ""Very"" was followed up by ""Disco 2"" in 1994 so maybe it took the place of ""Relentless"". Who knows. Either way, this is a collection of 6 amazing songs that I am so happy to have in my collection. I've put them in my ipod and I listen to them all the time with a renewed interest after its release 12 years ago!"
5,Excellent Analysis of Doing Business in China,"This book presents a very concise and perceptive analysis of doing business in China. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in understanding China's economy and the implications of technology's impact to this vast country. Today, China is the world's 3rd largest economy, and will be the world's largest economy (even surpassing the US) in about 10 years. Having a fundamental understanding of this country at this early stage is essential to everyone. There will be many investment and business opportunities in this vast country in the decades to come."
2,"This is just OK, but the FoodSaver rolls are better.","I decided to try this because of the price and the because I thought I was getting a free roll, but here is really no free roll because the 1 box has 2 small rolls. My biggest disappointment was that it did not have a writing strip (like FoodSaver rolls) to write the date and what is in the bag."
3,vacuum seal food storage,"The reason I only gave this a 3 star rating is because of the price and the box saying on the front that there was a free roll. What you get is just two roll of material that are priced just about what you could go to Wal-mart and get name brand Food Server rolls for. There is no free roll, just 2 rolls priced at about what 2 regular rolls would cost."
4,"Less money, just as good","If you have been buying vacumn seler bags, made by the manufacturer of your sealing machine, you may be paying to much as what you get here for a lower price. I think the quality is fine and they work great for me."
3,Good enough?,"I'm hesitant to review this product...I can't really say that they're bad or that they didn't work or anything else negative.Yet, I don't like them and will go back to buying the more expensive FoodSaver Brand that I usually buy -FoodSaver T010-00150-001 11-Inch-by-18-Foot Bag Material Roll, 3 Pack.Other's obviously like them, so try them and decide for yourself."
2,Not as good as the real thing,"The roll does not fit on the spindle for the foodsaver vac-u-seal so the roll would not feed correctly. You can only seal these bags in one direction with the inside strip down - if you flip it over, it will not seal. Also, the material tended to bunch up if the distance between the food and the end of the bag was not far enough - this caused it not to seal correctly and it leaked air. This also happens on the regular foodsaver vac-u-seal material but the distance is much shorter thus allowing for more bags per roll. On the positive side, the bags were easier to write on than regular foodsaver vac-u-seal material. I will spend the little bit of extra money next time and get the real thing."
5,I Love These.,"I have been using the food saver bags for about 10 years now, sometimes they are 18' long and sometimes 16'. Food saver seems to have gotten thinner than prior years and lots more wrinkles that prevent sealing. Decided to give these a try based on the price. First off, you are not getting a free roll, but you do get (2) 20' rolls, 40' long total for around $17.00, compared to (3) 18' rolls of food saver for around $35.00. Current price per lf is about .43 for this product and food saver is appx., .65 per lf. Savings of about 33%. Prices vary so you will have to do the math. As far as ease of use I feel these are easier, but they are not as heavy a mil., I have used 4 rolls so far with no wrinkles. I will update later as to holding up in freezer over time. If they do, and if price holds I will be a convert."
1,Doesn't work with Foodsaver!,"Its not the products fault, I believed some reviews I read that said this product would work with my Food Saver machine. Boy were they wrong, the bags don't allow the machine to suck out all the air and they don't seal properly. Buy only if you are sure they will work in your machine."
1,Does not work with Windows XP!,Crayola did not mention anywhere on the outside of the box that this product ONLY works with Windows 95 or 98. Very Frustrating!!
1,ONLY WORKS WITH WINDOWS 95/98,(...) I just got this product for my daughter and it only works on older systems. Im still trying to find a patch but haven't had any luck
1,Sad little girl,Unbelievable that a product sold for a computer would only work on old versions of windows. Waste of time and money and dissapointing for a Christmas present. Will return ASAP.
5,It is amazing,"I liked so much this product, it is a great innovation for the kids, I hope buy its in the future!!!"
4,Interesting,"Although from India, much of what has been mentioned in this book I did not know. This book is well written and a very good start, since it is presented in an interesting manner. The moguls presented in this book are the main ones i.e., Babur, Humayun, Akbar the great, Jahangir, Shahjahan and Aurangazeb. The moguls were an important part of Indian History and in this book they come across as actual people who once existed along with the rest of the time period. Before you start a warning: Dont look at this book with your present sensibilities, these were people who were a product and a part of their time and not ours. Somehow these brief histories make for a good read. I hope someone writes biographical novels about these colourful rulers."
3,Ok ball but not at all bouncy!,I bought this ball for my son to play handball in his room. The ball he currently uses is inflatable and quite noisy. Unfortunately this item just isn't bouncy but if you only need it for throwing/catching it is fine.
4,DISCOVER THE BEAUTY OF FREEDIVING,"This video is what got me started freediving. It is filled with exciting activities that make up the wonderful world of freediving. Even if you have no interest in ever freediving you will still enjoy this show. Terry Maas, Champion freediver introduces you to a world beneath the sea without the ecumbrance of scuba tanks. Beautiful underwater footage of whales, dolphins and other creatures. Other shows to watch in relation are: Freediving Made Easy and Blue Water Hunters - narrated by Peter Fonda."
3,Spicey,"My friend owns this single, and I've listened to it a few times before, so I think I can write a good review about it.""Wannabe"" is a catchy tune, that, even though it's not one of my favorite songs, it isn't one of my least favorites.I don't think I've ever heard ""Bumper to Bumper"" before, and if I have, I don't remember it.(...)"
1,dumb song,"I like my version better : ""if you wanna be my burger you gotta have extra chesse. lettuce nd tomato and extra pickles please."
2,A mixed bag of great & not so great tracks,"This Rounder CD which, I think, was originally issued on LP, apparently was never really revised or remastered since the days of LP. Most of the material is decent but there are quite a few great pre-war mandolin performances that are far stronger that are not issued on this set, such as ""Mandolin King Rag"" by Walker's Corbin Ramblers or any side by the Birmingham Jug Band. To make matters worst, the sound quality on several of the sides is pretty bad, considering that there have to be better copies around in the hands of collectors."
2,Not as pretty on my feet as in the picture,Maybe you need a glowing tan for these to work. My feet are a little narrow and my feet felt like they were swimming in these shoes. I gave them to a friend with wider feet. Not a huge deal because they were relatively inexpensive.
5,killer killer killer,"ITES! If you want to get it upside de head, if you want the true true, get this. Yes. Great comp. Wunderbar. Senor OOmph gives it fives wives out of five."
3,An ok buy,"This is a relativly good episode, but I would really not recomend it. It gets incredebly boring after you've seen it two times or so, and it then gets buried. If you want to see it, tape it off TV"
3,Eddington gets it!,"The Maquis 'war' against the Cardassian's has hit a brick wall now the Dominion are in league with Dukat, as such the Jem'hadar have been sent in to the DMZ (the area of space where the Maquis operate) and wiped out most of the rebel bases. But in one last ditch attempt by the Maquis to strike a devasting blow to their most hated enemies they have activated several cloaked missles that are headed for Cardassian targets. Sisko and Starfleet can't let this happen (in that order) and Commander Eddington, the former leader of the Maquis now in a Federation prison, is called upon to find these missiles and help destroy them before they reach their target. Bearing in mind Eddington and Sisko HATE each other the two set off in a shuttle together and attempt to stop the Maquis plan. When Sisko realises that the missiles do not exist he is stuck in the middle of the DMZ, with Eddington, and both are surrounded by Jem'hadar. A great episode that is the sequel to For the Uniform."
4,Real Life in the Mountains by the Seasons,"The collections of stories and poems all have the theme of the outdoors and about real often conflicted people. The collection is organized around the seasons of the year with ""Spring"", ""Treetopper"", ""Psalm"" and ""A Taste of Snow"".I especially enjoyed the story ""It All Ends Up in the Same Place"" by Benjamin Jahn. It is a story about two rough hewn young men living in and around the small towns in the mountains. The mental pictures are clear of nature and the unique characters of the story. They do not have much going for them. They just live, drink and drive in the hills. They pick up a young women hitchhiker who has plenty of life. The mental vision of what rains from the sky is both a surprise and what must be an amazing sight.It must be Spring because the bugs is hatchin! Great job!"
4,Quality - fits well,"Before buying these I got Carquest ""premium"" shoes which were China made and shabby - holes were inferfect, the shoes were riveted on crooked, and one of the shoes had a chip. So I returned them and got AC Delco. No problems."
2,Odo loses his virginity!,"This is a love episode, booooo, with Odo, booooo, yes those crazy folks at Paramount have decided to give Odo a touch of solid-love, and it doesn't look pretty. On his way out of Quark's Odo meets a woman at the bar, wink wink, she is called Arissa. But like everything related to Odo she is a criminal. Basically our Changeling has to protect Arissa from some other criminals and love blossoms - they even sleep together! Ahhhhhh!Odo loses his virginity! Ahhhhhhhhhhh! This episode is awful, there is a nice scene where Kira and Sisko discuss Odo's new found love in which Kira comes across as being very jealous but all in all a pretty lame attempt."
1,Very boring!,"At the time of this writing, there is one other review, and sadly, I agree with it. I lost interest in the first minute, but I watched all of it, in the hope that something would happen. It's very boring throughout, and really I had the feeling I was sloughing through mud. Although I know from personal experience that receiving comfort from a female friend can be innocent, it's not really clear in this movie. The entire movie is very disappointing!Side note: It's been over a month since I wrote the above review, and to the 3rd reviewer on here: I didn't like Dallas OR Deliverance, and I most definitely wasn't expecting anything like that. I had no preconceived notions about this movie when I watched it, and I try not to ever prejudge anything before I watch it. This movie is a MAJOR SNORE, complete with HIDEOUS acting, and it has nothing to do with the fact that I'm from America."
4,Good,The foam balls are being used by my teenage son that put a basketball hoop up in his bedroom. The balls don't destroy the ceiling or the rest of the walls. Plus I don't hear the noise when he makes a shot.
5,Safe & Fun for Little Ones,"Bought this ball for my toddler granddaughter. She loves to throw anything that is round and looks like a ball!! This soft ball works well because she can grip it, and throw it without causing too much damage in the house. She also loves the bright yellow color!"
5,"7"" Foam Ball; Uncoated; Yellow; no. MASFBY7-Review",The clinical staff in our clinics have been pleased with the foam balls used for therapy purposes. They have proven to be durable.
3,"Great peace of mind, but lots of false alarms","This item gives you amazing peace of mind - no more tip-toe trips into the baby's room to make sure she's still breathing. But if you have a high-quality, thick crib mattress, be prepared for lots of false alarms. She would scoot off into the corner of the crib, where the sensor pad couldn't detect her breathing. We had the sensitivity turned all the way up to 5, and had followed all the instructions to a ""T"" - yet the false alarms continued nightly. We eventually stopped using it at 9 months old because the false alarms were interrupting everyone's sleep. The peace of mind is worth its weight in gold. However, I wish the sensor pad was larger and/or the sensitivity made more sensitive."
5,There is NOTHING like Peace of Mind...and sleep!,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this monitor. Our little boy is a tummy sleeper...I know its not recommended but as all new parents know when they sleep everyone is happy. I was going crazy checking on him every 10 minutes or so...but now life is good...and I am able to enjoy being a parent so much more! The Angelcare monitor has been such a life saver! It is such a relief knowing that the alarm will sound if there is NO movement detected...and it has sounded...but only because my son scoots when he sleeps and sometimes he ends up in the corner of his crib where the monitor can not detect any motion. This device has allowed my husband and I to get a good nights sleep...and more importantly it keeps our little boy safe!"
4,Great product but could be even better.,"My husband bought this product so that I could stop checking on our baby when he started sleeping longer hours. Once you get the sensor set to a good level for your baby it works pretty well. We do get false alarms every now and then but it usually happens when he wiggles to the outer limits of the crib. I feel better with a few false alarms than I would constantly wondering if everything is okay. With that said, there is one major thing I would change to improve the product. If you turn the volume on the parents unit all the way down the alarm does not sound. I would prefer it if the alarm sounded on the parents unit no matter where the volume was set to. I sometimes will turn the volume down in my sleep and I'm paranoid that I'll do that and miss an alarm."
1,"Did not work, lousy customer service","The alarm kept sounding every few seconds even at the least sensitive setting. Customer care had us send in the monitor at our own expense (we had to buy a temporary substitute as well) and when they could not find anything wrong with the monitor -- they would not refund the money. However, the monitor simply would not work for us so we ended up throwing out the monitor and wasting almost $100. Infuriating."
3,"Movement sensor is good, RF is not good",The movement sensors works exactly as expected - no false alarms yet. It really helps let the paranoid parents get sleep.The receivers are have varying amounts of static regardless of the location in the house and are effectively unusable. Another brand monitor set we bought at the same time works very clearly anywhere in the house.This set uses 49.83 and 49.89 MHz.
4,great buy,"I really appreciate this monitor, with all of the concern about keeping baby on her back to prevent SIDS! My baby has been rolling over since she was 4 months old, therefore it was impossible to keep her on her back. But, this monitor has eased my mind. I've had no problems w/ false alarms, & it always alarms if I take her out of the crib w/out turning it off. Reception is questionable, I can only use one channel or I pick up neighbor's interference. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars. It also works just fine w/ a plain cardboard box under sensor pad."
3,Some false alarms,"After about a month of satisfaction it started to go off by itself sometimes when I was standing next to the crib and sometimes when we were sleeping. Should we trust this product? at the beginning I said ""Yes"" but after it started with the false alarms I have my doubts."
2,Don't recommend,My husband and I did not like this monitor at all. We went and bought a new one soon after our daughter was born. A lot of interference.
3,Not as mobil and Overpriced,I liked the idea being a new mom to have the protection for my son but I never used the sensory part in his crib. I thought I would try it but it went off to frequently and kept me up so that only lasted 2 days. We now only use the monitor part for listening into his room. I find the monitor to be really sensative and can make a loud hum at night which can keep me awake. I like the monitors however they are only pug in monitors so I cannot go outside with the. After purchasing it I thought I could have gotten something more mobil and far less expensive for what I need my monitor for.
1,the movement sensor doesn't work,"The product doesn't work properly, and i'm having problems to use de warranty outside USA."
5,Fabulous,"I bought this sensor for my daughter when she had her first baby, it is so good! She can rest and sleep with so much tranquility because she trusts the sensor. It is really and angel caring for another angel"
5,Works great,"I have been using it for about a month with my 3 and a half month old when I moved him to the crib from the Amby Baby (sleep hammock). He won't sleep on his back so I wanted something to make me feel more comfortable letting him sleep on his stomach. So far i have not had any false alarms and it works great. You need to make sure you put plywood underneath it to provide support if you have a spring-type crib. Also, I tested it to make sure it would go off when he was not in the crib (no motion) and it didn't work until I turned off the ceiling fan which seemed to cause enough vibration to activate it. So it is really sensitive and you need to make sure the alarm WILL go off if he were to stop moving/breathing. I have been really happy with this product and it eases my mind a lot. The sound quality of the monitor is excellent as well."
5,Peace of mind for a premie parent,"My son was born 8 weeks early and had trouble with apnea of prematurity. He came home on an apnea monitor and we purchased this monitor when he got close to going off of the hospital monitor. It has been a life saver!! It picks up the slightest movements, including a deep sleep breath. The optional tick feature is wonderful for hearing every breath he makes and keeping a paranoid parent from going to his bed every few minutes during naps. It also helps for a good night sleep with peace of mind knowing that he is ok. We have stabilized his cradle right now and it works well. I can't say enough good things about this monitor. I don't think I could be comfortable with my baby sleeping out of my sight if I didn't have this monitor."
3,Needs to be louder,"I really do love this product for what it is meant to be. A motion sensing monitor. It is the only way I'm able to let my daughter sleep in her own room. However, the actual ""monitor"" function is poor. You really have to bend your ear to hear her. Also, it can't be used as a 2 way to let her know you are on the way once you do hear her wake. We got this product after we had our Evenflow set, we use them together and it works out well."
5,GOT TO HAVE IT,I PURCHASED THIS A WEEK AFTER MY DAUGHTER CAME HOME. I FINALLY SLEPT THROUGH THE NIGHT. WE'VE ONLY HAD 2 FALSE ALARMS AND BOTH TIMES WERE BECAUSE SHE CURLED HERSELF UP IN THE CORNER OF HER CRIB. MY DAUGHTER IS ALMOST 4 MONTHS OLD AND I KNOW I WOULDN'T BE GETTING ANY SLEEP IF I DIDN'T PURCHASE THIS MONITOR. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PURCHASES I'VE MADE. I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT IF IT COST $300. I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT IT.
4,Angelcare,I really liked this product and it helped alleviate my fears. The only thing that I do not like is the ticking sound is quite loud and almost startles my baby at times. It would be nice to be able to use this monitor with the sound and have the alarm on for the movement with an option to not have it tick as well.The ticking makes it hard for me to sleep as well.
1,Very poor quality for such a high price!,"In addition to the extreme amount of background noise produced by this monitor, our receiver quit working less than a year after we started using it. The wiring started to short out, so we had to duck tape the wire in position in order for the receiver to stay on. A couple of months later it flat out stopped working (in the middle of the night, so we were unable to hear our daughter crying). I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone! If I could have rated it Zero Stars I would have."
4,Peace of Mind,"My husband and I bought this for our firstborn son when he was about 1 month old. We moved him out of our room and into his crib upstairs around that time and we were terrified of SIDS. We were deciding between this and a video monitor. I think this product is wonderful. Sure, there are false alarms. We've had to increase the sensitivity a bit and we still get them. However, being woken up occasionally for a false alarm is much preferred to not being woken up for a true emergency. It also alerts us to times he has rolled to the side of the crib. I find the sound quality superior to our other monitor (Fisher Price Sounds and Lights). Even though the price is a good value, can a price really be put on a parent's peace of mind?"
5,EVERYONE NEEDS THIS,"I am neurotic about SIDS, for the entire first year. I was with my son, and I am with my new daughter. If you can get your baby to sleep anywhere other than right next to you, you need to buy this. I'm sure I didn't sleep a wink for the first week worrying, and finally bought this. I slept for a full hour (as long as he'd sleep in his cradle) and it gave me my sanity. Currently, I have this in a Summer brand bassinet that is in our bed and my daughter will sleep in it better than she ever would in the cradle. I have this monitor underneath the Summer mattress (it's elevated about 1/2 inch above our mattress), and it actually still works. We just turned down the sensitivity a smidge. It doesn't pick up my breathing, just my daughter's. It's really a lifesaver.Please always talk about false positives (alarming when there's no emergency) and i've never experienced this. Even if you had a false positive, that's better than losing your child. You can also use it as a regular monitor."
2,Used to work great,"Started out fine, everything was great. But now, a few years later, the sound is awful. Whenever the speaker activates because our guy is making noise, it sounds like a distorted helicopter. It loses connection randomly, beeps all the time. We are about to toss it and buy a new one, to be honest. I don't understand, it seems to have ""worn out"" which makes no sense. It is just a speaker and monitor, nothing to fail..."
4,Awesome,"It certainly gave me peace of mind when my little one slept. We had a couple instances when the alarm went off....and it was not a false alarm. Thankfully this alarm alerted us when our girl stopped breathing. The only complaint I have is that the sound monitors seem to wear out after a while. After about 4 months 1 of mine just stopped recieving sound, and now I think the other one is going (sounds funny when my hand gets close)."
2,False Alarm,"we purchased this as a second monitor as our first one has a great picture but subpar sound. We are in the process of moving our son to his crib and I thought this would give me peace of mind. Within the first week we had two false alarms, which wake him up each time. Not fun. Better false alarms than no alarm but still, this is poor product performance."
3,"Good Motion, Poor Audio.","The motion detector part works well, we haven't had it go off at night, but it does when we take our baby out and forget to turn it off.The sound quality is poor. The sensitivity is good, but there is a ton of static. Also it is difficult to adjust the volume on the monitor - very small changes on the sliding control lead to great differences in the volume."
5,If I could give this 6 stars I would,"This is a wonderful product. I am a first time mom, neurotic, I know. But there is such a difference in my peace of mind with this monitor. I highly recommend it.We have had three false alarms, and only because our daughter is a very active sleeper and jammed herself into the corner of the crib, and out of range. Even then, it is worth it. I'd rather know if she has her face buried in the crib bumper so I can slide her out to the middle.It's great, I can't say that enough. I'm so glad I am having kids now when there are products like these available."
5,Great monitor!,We just bought this monitor for our a 3-month old and love it. This is a great monitor especially for those babies who likes sleeping on their tummies. It detects the slightest motion and now we feel like we have peace of mind knowing that the alarm will sound if motion isn't detected. The only draw back I've found so far is that sometimes there's static that comes through on the parent unit and there are only 2 channels.
5,works great,"We had a regular monitor but my husband was waking up about 10 times throughout the night to check on our son. Since we got this it gave us peace of mind--which is really the main reason I think anyone should really get this. If you are fine with a regular monitor and you aren't always checking on your baby throughout the night, then you may not need this. But if you will sleep better with a product like this I definitely say buy it. We have not had any problems with false alarms--we put a piece of sturdy cardboard under the mattress per other reviewer suggestions and I think that has been the reason why. If I am using the audio part of the monitor I have picked up neighbor's frequency but since we really only use it at night for the sensor element, this has not been a problem for us."
2,THE FEEDBACK MADE THIS UNIT ABSOLUTELY UNBEARABLE,"The concept is there, but the reverberation or feedback that was heard was unbearable. The transmitter was only 30' away from the receiver and the feedback was LOUD, LOUD, LOUD.Just to be sure, we exchanged the unit, but the same problem occured. We bought a baby monitor that just had sound. If you absolutely need the motion sensor then I guess you don't have a choice. But if that is just an extra that you want, then don't buy this one. Maybe they don't use the best strength in frequency, who knows. All we know is that we had to get a different one! I meant to give it only 1 star, but if I could I would give it a ZERO!!!!We bought the Safe Glow and that works fabulously in the same location that this one worked horribly.Great concept, but bad unit. Sorry."
3,Reception Problems,"We actually returned this product because we could not get clear reception in our house. Our home is only 1700 square feet, so there should have been no reason for the unclear reception. Never even got to see if it did everything it was supposed to do."
4,"a life saver, literally","my son was not born premature but being a first time mom i was very nervous about him sleeping on his stomache but that was the only way he would sleep. the minute i put him on his back he would wake up. needless to say, i spent many restless nights with his regular monitor reciever in my bed next to my ear on the loudest setting listening to him breathing. a friend of mine told me about the anglecare and when i found it i purchased. i put it to the test; i put a book on the mattress and the alarm went off. i put my hand on the mattress and the sensor, which is under the mattress, didn't go off. the sensor pad is so sensative that just from the pulse in my fingers it didn't go off. my son rolled over and into his face was pushed up againt his bumperpad. the alarm went off. the the only problem i did have with this produce was the recievers had a constant static sound no matter where i put it."
5,The most amazing product ever,I can not live without this monitor. It has allowed my husband and I to sleep with a peace of mind. I recommend it to anyone having a baby--so far in my family 3 people have had babies and all purchased this monitor. I can't stress how great it is. It truly is the best product ever made.
3,Great when it works correctly...,We are on our second bebesounds monitor and it's great when it's working properly. Our first one worked great until the baby turned about 4-5 months and now it gives us false alarms every night. It will either beep just once every half hour or it will beep for about 7 seconds every hour. It's very irritating because we followed ALL of the directions and no matter what we have it set on it doesn't work properly. When it does this our daughter is laying directly on the sensor pad and everything. If you get one that works this is the best monitor ever but if you have any trouble forget it. This company has no website or anywhere to find help so that makes me think they are a little shady.
5,Worked great,"I used this for my son until he was no longer in his crib. I loved it. I was able to sleep better know that the monitor would alert me of a problem. If we had a false alarm I didn't have a problem with it false alarms are a small price to pay for peace of mind. I did have a problem with remember to turn the monitor off when I took him out of his bed, but that is my own fault not the monitors. I did not use the receiver portion because my house is small and I only wanted to make certain he was breathing/moving."
1,Terrible...,"First night home from the hospital...wife doesn't want me in the room due to snoring. She just wants to call me in to change diapers, etc. during the night. So I set this monitor up RIGHT BESIDE her on her bedside table, I have the listening end plugged in for full power, volume cranked, and it sounds like a buzzsaw. I switched channels and it is no better. Then, on top of that, she could practically scream and it would be heard as a soft whisper to me. I am giving this 1 star because the motion sensor is neat, but I am returning this monitor. For quality sound, buy Sony (we used a Sony with our first child and it is clear and loud. We will use it again for our second). Sony is a top Audio vendor in the professional recording world, so if you think about it, this makes sense. As for communication with my wife, we bought motorola walkie-talkies and this has worked perfectly.Do not buy this monitor."
2,Loved it until it dropped!,"This monitor worked well until it was dropped. It was a little staticky, but we tolerated it. I never used the movement sensor, so I can't tell you how that worked. It should be built much sturdier for the price."
1,don't waste money on this. . .,"Get the deluxe, the original is very staticy and has very few other monitor features. The deluxe is 100% better."
2,Works great.... for 5 months,"I bought this for my son but some days ago, just like that, the sound monitor went nuts... I notice that even do my son is not laying in his crib the monitor still goes beeping as if everything is ok. Dont know if the problem is the movement sensor or the sound monitor. I will need to buy another one because i live in Ecuador and we cannot sent it to be checked."
2,"Buzzes, Inaccurate","This monitor has a loud hum/buzz. The motion detection mat didn't work well, we got a lot of false alarms."
5,Could not have done without this monitor!,"This has bought me peace of mind. I am a worry wort and being a mom of a 2 month old, I'm very scared of SIDS.....this monitor is worth every penny.We have tested this monitor by placing DS in the center of the crib, at the edges of the crib and in every which way...we've changed rooms and it has NEVER failed us. It did give us a couple of false alarms...but I'd rather that than the unthinkable chance of SIDS. Just be sure that u have a solid surface under the mattress on which to put the sensor on. The solid surface helps disseminate the movement of the child evenly reducing the chance of false alarms, etc.If you are a worrier like me....look no further."
2,Poor quality,Its been 1.5 years with it and now the electrical cord has a fautly connection need the monitor unit plugin.Its always had an irritating buzzing sound that we can't seem to filter out (even after adding a toroid)And now its started beeping occasionally. Turning the sensitivity down to zero didn't solve the problem. Now we have to use the sound only option.What a waste. Why can't things be built to last anymore!
1,Static makes monitor worthless,"All aspects of the monitor worked well for me except one. The parent monitor picks up a lot of static while also picking up sounds of baby. This is a big problem as the static is disruptive beyond a minor annoyance. We can't use the monitor because the static is too much. It's impossible to get to sleep with it droning on. Had I known static would be part of this product, I would not have purchased it. I feel I've been sold a worthless product."
5,I love this monitor,"I used this monitor with my son and have now purchased another one so I'll have two for the upcoming birth of my twin girls. This monitor allowed me to sleep at night and not be so worried about SIDS. If you are the type that gets up many times at night to check on your child, this monitor is for you!"
4,Mostly good,"Sound is very clear and we don't have any issues with static. I like it overall, but my only complaint is that the sensor pad isn't large enough. If my son is too far away, it goes off, and this happens quite a bit now that he's rolling around."
4,"Good motion monitor, poor sound quality and range","My wife and I already owned an excellent sound monitor. We purchassed this unit primary for the motion monitor. Because our 1 month old daughter would only sleep on her tummy, this product has given us great peace of mind. It only alarmed once, when she had managed to roll away fromthe sensor pad to the other end of the crib (at 3 months old). When we first installed the product (which was very easy), we would forget to turn the sensor off when picking her up, which would make it alarm each time-- this gave me confidence that it works properly and would alarm in the event of an emergency. The sound quality is not as good as competing non-motion sensing products, and we use this product in conjuction with our other monitor. When the product alarms, we can hear it on the sound monitor that we use very clearly."
4,Good product but a WORD OF CAUTION!!,"This is a good monitor. The feedback does buzz a little loudly, but it's just because it picks up the baby's sounds so well. One word of caution, do not use a fan near the baby's bed, or even a ceiling fan on high. We took our daughter out of the crib and had the ceiling fan on high, and the monitor is so sensitive that it detected the fan as her breathing and continued to flash the green light (meaning that it detects breathing) and the alarm never sounded. And she wasn't even in the bed! So, make sure you use it in a still room away from fans, vents, etc. Leave the bed empty and turn the monitor on to test if it will detect false breathing from things in the room."
4,False Security?,"My son was premature and was on an Apnea/Heart monitor for the first six months. We recently had a string of good downloads so his cardiologist decided to take him off the monitor. I didn't sleep for a week just lying there watching him breath (still worried), until I saw this product and ordered it right away. I've had it for about a month now and have slept much better and I know he does too since I'm not putting my hand on his back every five minutes.The problem I have with the product- The other night my son was crying and I picked him up, forgetting to turn the monitor off and it kept sensing movement (ticking). It never alarmed! My husband and I must have watched and waited for 10 minutes. NO ALARM! Now I'm wondering if it would alarm at all. I hope it's something I'm doing wrong and can figure it out. Too many good reviews not to be a good device. That's why I gave it 4 stars. I just wish I knew why it didn't alarm."
3,Movement/Sound monitor,"Using the BebeSounds movement sensor w/ sound monitor for the purpose I purchased it for (the movement sensor), I find it works very well. It does give me peace of mind. The alarm sounds very loudly and can be heard throughout the house (have only heard while testing it out-no real emergencies!)However, as a sound monitor alone, not crazy about the interfernce/static it seems to have....Also the volume aspect of using it just for sound, isn't as loud as I'd like for outside time....."
2,Hoped for a better product,"I try to be an educated buyer and when we were shopping around for baby monitors, read many reviews and felt this would meet our needs. (sigh)But unfortunately after using it for a couple of months I have given up on the ""bee noise"". It has serious issues with static and wish it had more channels to work with, due to some signal interference. Do like the 2 monitor option and the pad, but I would recommend you go with the deluxe option...wait for a sale and make the effort on the extra bucks...it is worh it!"
5,This product saved our child's life,"One of our preemie twins was sent home from the NICU without an apnea monitor, because he had had no apnea events for several weeks. He was sleeping peacefully in his crib, with his aunt working in the kitchen, listening on the monitor. The monitor signaled an alarm, and by the time she raced to the bedroom, his face was blue, and his lips were purple. She picked him up, rubbed him vigorously, and revived him. He survived, and is happy and healthy.If I could suggest an improvement, I'd ask that the European version with rechargeable batteries be sold in the USA. We keep an extra set of four AAA rechargeable batteries always charged for the ""roving"" monitors. We plug in the monitor that never leaves the kitchen."
5,I have used this monitor since October 2002 and still use it,This is a great monitor! I used it for my first born son in October 2002 and had only 1 false alarm because he got in the corner of the crib! Then comes my second born son November 2003 and he used it up until he was a year old with the movement monitor and now I just use it for the audio part so I know if my boys are acting up in their room (yes they share a room) or if they get sick at night! I love this monitor and love the fact that it has battery backup so if the lights go out I still can monitor them!
4,Great for preemies,"This monitor has worked very well for motion sensing but not great for sound due to the poor audio quality. However, we purchased a Sony BabyCall for the sound and now use both together. The motion sensor is AWESOME! I've never had a false alarm and it always goes off after 20 seconds on those occasions when I've forgotten to turn it off after removing her from the crib. I do have to agree with everything Graham wrote in his review about the design. That's why I didn't give it 5 stars. Even with the design flaws, it is well worth it for the peace of mind!"
5,One way to get sleep,"I had this with my daughter when she was born, that was 5 years ago and now we have another one on the way and I wouldn't go with any other monitor then this one. It's one way to guarantee sleep so your not getting up every 10 minutes to check to see if the baby is still breathing.I love it and recommend it to first time moms or moms who have 10 kids. It's a great product."
5,I was skeptical,"Reading Amazon.com reviews is what I always try to do--I came across this monitor when my wife and I had our baby girl. I purchased the monitor since my wife was worried about any possibility of SIDS and would get up in the night to check the baby without the motion monitor.Well, after two kids, I can tell you the only thing I don't like about the monitor is that it drains batteries if it is not plugged in. Oh, the other bad thing is that it does take some adjustment so you don't get awakened to the alarm once your baby starts rolling over or moving around the crib--at that point SIDS is usually an afterthought anyway."
3,Not reliable,"This monitor has a great idea behind it but it isn't reliable. My daughter was out of the bed for 20 minutes before the alarm went off several times....which we discovered was because our ceiling fan was on. It apparently detected the movement from the fan as the baby breathing. Unfortunately, in the heat of summer, we need the fan on so the monitor is worthless to us right now. If my daughter moved sideways in the crib, we also got a lot of false alarms. The receivers aren't the greatest of quality either and there are only 2 channels so we got a lot of interference. We love our Sony Babycall monitors...much better quality."
5,Wonderful,After 4 weeks of no sleep - we realized Lucas liked to sleep on his belly. He slept for 5 straight hours on his stomach (during the day while I watched)when we finally caught on. Everytime he was layed on his back he woke up within minutes. I bought this on line after a friend told me about it. It has been wonderful. I no longer worry about laying him down and would definately suggest this to everyone with a newborn. The only time the alarm has gone off is when we forget to shut it off after picking Lucas up.
3,Excellent for first 4 months but then lots of false alarms,"This monitor was fabulous for the first few months when our daughter didn't move around much in her crib. However, now that she moves around a lot it is constantly going off - almost every night. After too many nights where our sleep is broken due to this alarm we have ordered the Babysense II monitor which covers the whole crib. Hopefully this will be better."
2,"Static, anyone?!","First of all, the movement pad WOULD NOT be accurate. First it wouldn't beep, even if nothing was on it. Then I messed with the sensitivity and then it beeped for my son sleeping 3 times during one nap, and he was totally fine. So I just turned the stupid movement sensor off, which of course is THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS MONITOR.Also, the sound portion (just using it as a normal monitor) is REALLY static-y. For no reason at all. A few times I had to turn it down SO much so I could sleep through the static that I couldn't hear my baby.Buy a different monitor. Seriously."
2,Stops working--very disappointed,My 3rd unit just stopped working!!!!! They can and will stop working properly. I bought my first in 2007 it worked great it was never moved and stored in my closet. 2010- I used the same unit for my next baby it worked until 2 months it started alarming. I actually took my baby to the ER after the 3rd alarm in one night and was very embarrassed. I bought a new unit and tested the old one by installing them both the one from 2007 started to go off for no reason. Now in 2012 just had my 3rd baby- my second unit stopped working so I bought my 3rd and now it has stopped working. I will not replace again. I now have the Snuza so far so good but we will see. There is no reason for me to have to had buy 3 units. They were not moved and were stored properly in between babies. I cannot recommend this product when I had to replace it 3 times now.
3,More country than rock,"I bought this CD because a friend of mine was playing a compilation tape he had made that had the song ""Copperhead Road"" on it. I am not a country music fan, but I loved ""Copperhead Road"" with its energy and biting lyrics. Then, after I read about Steve Earle and his journey through recovery, I decided to buy this album. I was hoping to find an entire CD full of songs like Copperhead Road, but alas I did not. Few of the tracks are produced in as polished a manner or display the blend of country and rock that I had found so appealing in Copperhead Road. Indeed, about the first half of the CD is pretty much mainstream country with minimal instrumentation. Steve Earle is still a remarkable guy and he writes songs with great lyrics, but if you are like me and are thinking about buying the CD simply because you like Copperhead Road, I would recommend saving your money for another album."
4,Almost Perfect,"This compilation was released by MCA to capitalize on the wealth of material Earle recorded while under contract with the label, and is a chief financial officer's dream: an easy money-maker which features embarrasingly low-budget cover art, hardly any promotional expense, total lack of insightful liner notes, and some of the strongest, most influential country-rock music recorded in 20 years on either coast, guaranteeing mega-sales. Earle's career is represented well here, beginning with the legendary ""Guitar Town"" days and stopping before Earle's bombastic, drug-wrenched live album. For the uninitiated, this is a terrific introduction to the music of one of the best songwriters alive. For long-time fans, the verdict is clear: The music deserves 5 stars, but the CD packaging budget director at MCA should have been fired and put back to work washing dishes."
4,Excellent Album!,"All of what Steve does is good... I love these early songs just as much as the songs on ""Transcendental Blues"" which is a creative leap forward to my ears, but like I say, it's all good when Steve Earle makes music and as far as his politics go, he can speak his mind all he wants to and I would still buy his music, even if I didn't agree with him. So shout it out Steve, I got not problem with Americans having their say and that goes for the Dixie Chicks too. This is America, land of free speech, that's one thing that makes our nation great!"
1,somebody shoot krazy 5 times,bad enough master p used pac's unreleased songs on just about every nom limit release having ghim and c murder imitate pac was'nt enough he now has krazy another pac clone on here guess he could'nt get tha realerst on here since suge had him on a leash gimme me pac any sday no limit was trash by 2000 anyweay.
2,Good but price keeps changing...,"I purchase these for my 76 year-old mom who is in a nursing home. I switched to Per-Fit over her previous brand because of the better price. Unfortunately for me, the price of Per-Fit seems to go up with each order. The current order cost $20 more than the one two months before and I'm very unhappy. Also unfortunately for me, however, my mom is 100 miles away and I had no choice but to pay since she was all but out of protective underwear.I wish Per-Fit would allow those of us who ""Subscribe and Save"" to actually save!"
2,boring video,"I was not impressed at all with this video, it was boring and the illustrations looked as if they were made in microsoft paint. They were very simple, and ""stick figure-ish"". The word was shown once such as ""pajaro"" and then a song about a bird would play, then on to the next word followed by a song about that word. I don't think kids can really learn much from this video, especially with the illustrations being so poor and no real language, just songs. Luckily I only paid a few bucks for this dvd."
3,"Entertaining, BUT Lacks the Teaching Element","Although the DVD is entertaining, it does not have the ""teaching"" quality necessary for easily learning new words in a different language, which is what I mistakenly thought this DVD was suppose to do - For example, it starts with a picture of the word & an illustration of the word (""El Sol"" with a drawing of a sun""), with a man's voice stating the word ONLY ONCE, then a nursery song follows that has the word that was displayed/said within the song. THAT IS IT. Some of the illustrations are confusing, for example, my daughter asked ""does that mean rooster or owl?"" because the word listed was ""El Cucu"" & below it was an illustration of a rooster & an owl - my daughter is 2 1/2, since she doesn't read yet, she relies on the illustration to explain what the word means.Again, my daughter enjoys the music on the DVD, but isn't really learning any Spanish."
5,Armed and Dangerous,"This is one of the best books about the anti-apartheid struggle I've read - by someone who was in the thick of it who is obviously both brave and politically astute. Ronnie Kasrils, the author, was a leader in the armed struggle and is now a leader in the South African government - Minister of Water and Forestry. His transition is documented in an updated version of this book published by a different publisher."
5,Colorful Characters,"Reef Dance is a compelling legal mystery novel with an intriguing story line. J. Shepard, the main character, is a lawyer/surfer who encounters many strange & interesting individuals in his dual worlds. The book flows seemlessly between the court room & surfing scenes, both of which are described with a gritty realism. Surfers will feel an immediate connection with the depiction of various surf spots and the surfing lifestyle in general. The baby-selling case was gripping and presented a stark & realistic picture of how much more difficult it is for the ""have-nots"" to get a get a level playing field when competing with the ""haves"" in our society. The case also has some hilarious moments when surf legend Jackie Pace helps his ""bro"" J. Shepard with some crack detective work. The book really moved along. I found it hard to put down."
1,NOT SO SCARY MOVIE,With BLACK GATE you get:1. A ridiculous plot which makes little if any sense.2. Horrible acting.3. Lighting so inadequate you spend most of the film in darkness.4. Really hokey special effects.5. No scares or suspense.A real time waster.Nuff said!
1,this is very awuful,this so called movie id not scary at the slightest. 1 of the worst things in the whole movie is that this guy falls in love with a woman normal right not when the woman is a ghost. you just start to find out why they died and who the ghost are at least half way in the movie. even though they ARE IN THE HOUSE from the beginning of the movie. never see it. the only reason why i rate it a 1 star is because i got to rate it a star.
1,The worst movie I've ever seen,"I had the displeasure of seeing this movie about two years ago and unfortunately I have not been able to forget how bad it was. The effects are terrible, which is forgivable in a movie like this, but the acting was so bad that I think a band of wild chimpanzees could have given a comparable performance. One particularly memorable scene involves a male character sitting on a bed and feigning deep emotion as he strokes the cheek of a CG ghost. It may sound like it would be worth it to watch this for the amusement factor, but trust me - it's not."
1,kinda petered out after awhile,"We really liked it at first, although the sound quality was never really good on the outgoing message or on the recorded messages. But we've only had it for a year now, and have to look at replacing at least the answering machine part. The recorded messages just started sounding quieter and quieter and now they are sometimes not audible at all. Ah, well, just after we bought it those audible caller id phones came out and I was kicking myself that we didn't have one of those, so here's my chance! :-)"
1,Not user friendly,"This device is cumbersome and not easy to use. And if the power is out, basic phone functions do not work even though it's a corded phone.You cannot set the volume control while listening to a message, it looses it's settings if there is a power glitch, even a small one. Very slow to respond to key functions.I'll be purchasing another device or going to Verizon for vmail service. (God help me!)"
5,when love calls you better answer,"I love this book and the story it tells. I was angry each time I had to put it down, because life would call me to another venue. It was a joy to read and I am so glad I bought it"
2,A very slow read!,"This book was very slow and hard for me to read. I still haven't finished reading it. It's too slow. However, I will eventually finish it as I've paid money for it. In my opinion, it was not a good book. If you want to read it, I would suggest borrowing it from the library instead of spending your money on it."
3,"Edwina's review of When Love Calls, You Better Answer","Although this is an enjoyable book, I would not count it as Bertice Berry's best, because in my opinion, that honor goes to (1) Redemption Song and (2) The Haunting of Hip Hop. It is an easy read and has its good moments, as in when the title line comes up (which reminded me of the song by the same title)."
5,She continues to delivery her best,I started reading this novel and couldn't put it down. I finished it in a day. This is a must read for anyone who has given up on love.
5,The referral,"My best friend, who lives in Virginia, called me as soon as she read this novel. She insisting that I find a copy of it and read it, as it reminded her of me. I found it on Amazon and in no time, it was delivered. Granted...it was from a library and not brand new, but I was pleased nonetheless."
2,a no no,"great story line, but the delivery was really bad, halfway in i gave up. a big dissapointment"
4,Interesting time in history that lacked information,"""The Color of Fire"" is about a time in history I didn't even know existed. Leave it to Ann Rinaldi to expose her readers to it. With the title of this book, I thought she wrote another book about The Salem Witch Trials. I had no idea black people were burned alive for supposedly burning buildings. The story itself was very interesting, and I think Rinaldi did a very good job with hooking the reader in and having them feel the anguish and pain Phoebe felt. My major complaints are the lack of an epilogue and a historical note better explaining this unnoticed time in history. I ""sorta"" recommend."
2,very disappointed!,"my reason for the disappointment was the way peter was played. this ""Peter"" was seeminly depressed, fearful, withdrawn and definitely NOT the leader of the apostle's. omar shariff is a very ""strong"" actor (usually) and the part he plays as Peter doesn't fit his character at all. my impression of peter was that he was unable to make decisions, and always wanting to run away from any responsibilities or decisions the apostles were depending on from him. Jesus told Peter he was the ""rock"" but he seemed more like a ""sponge""! I have watched this movie many times and as yet feel it's worthy of the man who plays the title. If I had better information or seen a small trdailer of this movie I would NOT have bought it."
5,Peter,"This is one of those movies that i will watch later, like the 10 Commandments. It's pretty accurate to scripture I haven't investigated it too closely yet, but I did enjoy it."
3,"Great, but Catholic","This film is very welll done, but is not suitable for all religions. Throughout, the baptism is done by sprinkling. There is emphasis on the church being built on Peter, and in the film Peter makes the statement that the church will be forever centered in Rome."
1,Not Based on Bible,"This movie makes the effort to make a type of Christ out of the apostle Peter. It teaches that the persecution of Christians ended with the dead of Peter, but it actually intensified. Neither it is biblical that the center of the church was Rome, let's not forget that Romans were pagans and idolaters and morally corrupt. Furthermore, this film takes emphasis in glorifying Peter when Peter was like any other apostle or believer in Jesus a servant of Him. Let's not forget that Jesus was the Messiah and came as a servant."
1,How can I review while I don't have it,I am sorry to say that I have never this product from you!! And I will be pleased if I can receive this item latter.
1,pagan catholic propaganda movie,"This DVD is blasphemous and includes much paganism from the start. It is an obvious attempt to proclaim that peter was the first pope.I cannot believe how many people believe this movie followed the bible. The first 1/2 hour loosely followed the bible but included much paganism. The rest of the movie was unbiblical and made peter out to be holier than anyone else and is an attempt to get people to believe he was the first pope. The entire movie was totally pagan / catholic. This movie is blasphemous and should not be watched by anyone. It is sad how many people think it was a good movie and claim it follows the bible.If you are a TRUE Christian, this movie is very pagan and blasphemous. For those who are pagans/ catholics, you will probably like the movie as it feeds your pagan beliefs.If there was an option for no stars, I would have given this movie no stars."
1,What a disappointment,"What a terrible disappointment this movie was, I am shocked with the positive reviews? My husband and I could only manage to watch 20 minutes before pulling the dvd. It had many areas of contrast to the KJV. The acting was so poor, especially the actor playing Jesus. If you want to see a more accurate, great acting biblical DVD, buy Jesus of Nazareth. So glad I only wasted a few dollars on this one."
3,St. Peter Omar Sharif,"What happen to the feisty character of the Bible? Peter, as depicted in this film,acted timidly, tentatively, and apologetically. An overly long film, the editor should haveshortened the romantic interlude. The scenes of the Roman circus caught the attentionof the teens who watched the film. They realized the brutally of the age."
3,Could have been better.,"Scripture out of text, scripture out of order. Acting pretty good, art work and set construction beautiful. Even though it was not in 5.1 surround, the audio was great. Very long movie, too many sceens jumping forward and back."
1,Turning a great story into a grating one,"This has got to be the worst movie ever created on the life of Peter. How can the mix of a great actor and a great story turn into such a piece of crap. First off the voice and video are a millisecond off, enough to notice. Secondly, this is the worst writing I have ever heard. The corny, staged dialogue is painful. There are several moments in the movie where names/places are mispronounced and later pronounced correctly. Pilate was pronounced Pee-latte at one point, and I think the other was the name Emmaus....they butchered it several different ways.Omar Sharif was always a great actor but boy he blew chunks big time in this one. Save your money or better yet buy Peter and Paul with Sir Anthony Hopkins and Robert Foxworth..now that was good acting!Also check out St. John in Exile, a brilliant one man show by Disney great Dean Jones....kudos on a masterpiece."
2,"opinions , opinions","This is a product concocted in a haste,it is depressingly bad, with possible exception of moments of good acting of the tired star. It is not accurate , as the previous reviewers noted. It is NOT a work of art. Many soap operas are of much better artistic quality. It is depressing to see how great themes are treated to achieve mediocre goals."
3,Put together well,"I thought the acting in this movie was a little sub-par. I thought Peter look silly at times. That being said the story line was good. They attempted to be accurate to the bible. I would recommend this movie even though it is long, really long."
4,devout!,"I love, love, love this movie. I watch it at least twice a year.However, you will not enjoy it if you do not already have a great love of St. Peter, our first Pope. Some of the voices are obviously dubbed, much of the plot created out of thin air. It is sentimental, and ""devout"" in the Catholic sense of the word.Peter is portrayed very much in keeping with the feel of his New Testament letters. Kind, fatherly, full of compassion and understanding, with deep remorse for his denials of Jesus on the night of the Last Supper. The over-all message is one of forgiveness for human weakness and hope for the future."
3,Impressive in scope... perhaps too impressive,"Zigmond et al. is very up-to-date text, incorporating many discoveries from the last couple years. Unfortunately, many of these experiments are yet to be replicated. Additionally, I feel the book, with its numerous authors, lacks coherence"
3,CAVEAT (emptor): It's just the images!,"I can't say much about the book. I skimmed through it, didn't find so much better stuff compared to, let's say, Kandel & Schwartz. I thought buying the ""CD version"" would give me a slim, searchable CD-ROM instead of another tome of neuroscience stuff. My fault.On the other hand the leaflet of the CD-ROM states clearly ""fundamental NEUROSCIENCE images"". If anyone were to be blamed at all, it'd be me jumping to conclusions and maybe Amazon for not pointing out that it's a CD-ROM full of images (ca. 900 TIFs and some GIFs (<3%)). It's just the images, no legends etc. The viewer is Kudo. It displays thumbnails and seems to have problems keeping the aspect ration when enlarging the viewing window. (It will let you make slide shows, screen savers etc. But that's not exactly why I would by a publication on neuroscience)."
3,Mediocre,"While this book covers a wide range of topics in sufficient depth, it does not flow well. Much of the information is repeated from one chapter to another. There are also misspellings and other errors that indicate that this book was not well edited. The pictures presented in the book are sometimes not sufficiently explained and sometimes do not relate well to the information being presented in the text."
4,A very comprehensive source,"Definitively, neuroscience is a sub-area of Physiology that has been growth exponentially in the last decades. In this sense, the new edition of Fundamental Neuroscience brings new insights about how the brain works. I recommend this book."
5,Satisfied customer,"This book arrived in excellent condition and in a timely manner, plenty of time before classes began, and I only ordered the book a couple weeks early."
5,A must in any med-school,"This book can make any person understand the basic aspects of Pathology, it requires a good level of Histology knowledge ( not more than a good approach of the previous course ). Excellent images and explanations make this issue a good purchase.The only drawback I've found is the fancy words the authors use to define something it's easy to understand, but after all I think it's a vey good choice."
2,Too detailed,"This text is not appropiate for any for introductory class to neuroscience at any level (whether grad or undergrad). The depth and detail leaves the reader confused at best. Perhaps it is suitable for an advanced gradute seeking to remedy any detail oriented holes. For all others, it is a precursor to a headache.The smart money would go with the Kandel who clearly defineshis purpose at the outset of his classic book.(I notice that the reviewer ,who bestowed the text 4 stars, and the author both call San Diego their home.)"
2,Battery Drain on Your Pocket,"Kodak should have stayed with standardized batteries on this one. If you need an extra or eventually will need to replace the Lithium Ion Battery Pack, plan to spend BIG bucks. If the Battery Pack runs low, you have to either stop what you are doing for an hour while you charge up the battery while in the camera. Or pay a LOT extra for an external charger and extra battery. If Kodak used standardized batteries, I'd give it 3 more stars. Paul"
4,Great Outdoor Shots So-So indoor.,I really love this camera. Its small compact and takes some really great shots...Outdoors indoors even with a flash it just doesnt get it right. I upgraded the firmware for the cam which improved the focusing slightly but not enough.
1,Out of Focus,"I recently bought a DC4800. I took several pictures inside and out. All of the indoor pictures were way out of focus. I thought that maybe I just got a ""lemon"". After checking around, I found out this is a comon complaint with the camera."
2,Not the camera I expected,I purchased a 4800 after owning a Kodak 260. The transition was not easy and the new camera just isn't what I expected. The software doesn't give me the flexiblity that the old one did and the camera buttons themselves are not placed well in design. I seem to keep turning the camera off - instead of taking pictures. Perhaps I just expected Kodak to make an improved version of what I considered to be a great camera - but to me - this is not what happened.
2,Nice - but don't rely on the flash,"I like everything about this camera but the flash. It has a very short range (10 ft max) and even within that range produces inconsistent exposures. Some are OK and some extremely dark. It is as if the circuitry that times the flash is not working properly. I returned the camera for repair or replacement and Kodak responded that operation was ""within design limits"". I guess it's a poor design. For the price, I expected better performance."
1,Poor Quality and Post-Purchace Support,"While the picture quality is quite good with this camera, the shutter delay is quite extreme. The low rating is more a factor of the quality of the camera and the post-purchase customer support. The camera completely stopped working just out of the one-year factory warranty. Kodak has a flat fee of $150 to repair. The camera stopped working once again after the third use, but since it was out of the 30-day repair warranty, Kodak would only offer another $150 repair or an upgrade to one of their other cameras with a trade in. The cost of the upgrade was more than the street price of the camera."
3,Great for outdoor pictures; try something else for low light,"I owned a Kodak DC280 and loved it. Took great shots and the flash worked great. I gave it away and bought the DC 4800 expecting similar great photos. The ones with plenty of light are fine, nice and crisp and print nicely. The ones in low light just aren't as good. I think the ""auto"" selects a shutter speed of 1/8/sec which is crazy and impossible to take a good photo without a tripod. The flash of course helps but you have to be within 8 - 10 feet. Bottom line. It's ok for the money, particularly if you buy one used (like I did) but if you want to print 8 x 10's you may want to keep looking."
1,Keeps breaking...and breaking...,"First time it died was just within the one-year warranty, and it died again a year later. I'm sending this $500.00 paperweight to Kodak's Vice President for Customer Relations with a nice note."
5,Awesome,"This is my first, and possibly last, digital camera. I won't need another. This thing is AWESOME! But do the camera justice and yourself a favor, get a photo quality printer."
3,Kodak DC4800 = Cheap,"I cannot understand why this camera is so highly rated. As an experienced photographer, I find the quality of components rather cheap, like for instance the plastic lens holder. I was also irritated that after spending over ... on the camera and all accessories, Kodak would not honor the ... rebate because of an adminstrative error."
3,Not the quality I had hoped for...,I purchased an Olympus camera for my parents that was only a 2.4 mgpix and then did some research and thought that the DC4800 would be better. I have used both and the Olympus by far has taken better pictures for half the price and almost have the pixels. My DC4800 takes better indoor pictures without the flash even though the camera tells me to use flash. Indoor quality is lacking compared to outdoor. The Olympus also captures action shots better than the DC4800 as well. Everyone has rated this camera well. Maybe there is something wrong with mine?
3,"A good 3.1 megapixel camera, but...","I've had this camera about 18 months. The only thing that I find lacking in this camera is its ability to take indoor flash pictures. Even using the +/- exposure compensater the pics come out under exposed, especially if the subject is more than 5 feet from the lens. Other features work well. I decided to stop fooling with this camera and went for the Canon S50, wow what a difference. Goodbye Kodak, hello Canon."
1,Poor in low light,"I owned a DCS280 and was very satisfied. The DCS4800 has all the features I want and all the manual controls. However, the automatic low light pictures are very disappointing. We use the autofunction to grab spontanious pictuers of our son. Needless to say, most are blurry. In addition, the eyeglass focus adjust or has fallen out with the setting out of focus. The pop up flash does not lock the flash in place. Small cracks have developed on the front of the camera case."
4,Kids Love It!,"I am a librarian in an elementary school and kids love this book as well as the Ink Drinker. I read both books to the kids and they are hanging on every word. It usually takes us two separate classes to read each book and they can hardly wait for the next time to finish the book. I think that some of the translation is a bit awkward, but that is minor. I recommend both books for reluctant readers!"
2,For Reference Only,"Adam von Trot zu Solz's brave stand against Nazi tyranny is methodically detailed with great minutae in this thoroughly researched compilation of his life story. Unfortunately, in the process of creating a detailed account, the author has removed almost all the readability from his work and the result is a slow read far less interesting than the captivating biography his subject deserves.Will be added to my shelf of historical works as a reference volume."
5,D'Addario guitar strings for 18 years,I've used D'Addario guitar strings for 18 years now and I wouldn't dream of using anything else. The color-coded ball ends make stringing up easy and the air tight packaging ensures that the strings aren't corroded when you open the pack. A truly great product!
2,Freediving Made Shoddy,"At the price you pay for this video you expect it to be at least professionally done. For the information value & content, I think I could have done as good a job in a couple of days. Would not recommend this purchase."
2,More or less....bad,"These knives give a good solid ""stick"" on wooden targets. However, I've had two break on bad throws. Consider them disposible."
5,Great Brush,"I love this Tunnel Brush. I have had the same one for about 15 years, and the little bristle tips are falling off, so I have searched the Internet for a replacement. I am surprised the brush is still being produced and I am so happy to find it. It is great for hair that needs body but not static while blow drying."
5,Keep turning the pages!,This is the type of book that makes you want to become part of the story. This book is sure to invoke emotion by all who read it. It also touches on some very sensitive realities we are all aware of. Read it and I dare you to not become emotional... this should be a mini series!
4,The Rain Will Tell,"Again, I was hopelessly enthralled. It took me exactly three hours to read and I am just gonna say WOW! I got lost in my own need to avenge all those hurt by her maliciousness. Thanks for the entertainment and I waiting anxiously for the next...."
5,This movie rocked.,Just thought I'd add my 2 cents. Just a damn good movie. If you are a fan of action adventure give this flick a go. You won't be disappointed.
4,Nice and wonderful movie!!!!!!,"It's very different movie. I like story, Star cast and their acting, specially Cole Grace Moretz as a hit girl.About Product, DVD & BD quality are great. DC work fine in my PC. Thank to Amazon. com for delivering product within time"
4,Fun Movie,"Fun Movie...almost rented it for a watch with parents movie over xmas, wouldn't have been a good movie for that."
4,Liked it a lot more than I thought,"As you watch it, you begin to give it points for being better than expected. The trailer leads you to certain conclusions, the movie goes somewhere a little more rewarding. A fun time. Not for the kids, but so what."
2,The sad lives of ordinary mortals with God complexes,"A silly and ultra-violent film that is totally pointless and insane. And kinda-sorta good fun to watch. Best thing about it is seeing McLovin again, except this time as a stuffed-nose anarchist. Nicholas Cage was pretty good, even if he was acting like a robot. The appearance of bottled rage, perhaps? The mafia boss was not really that dangerous-looking, at least not until he shot that kid in cold blood in the middle of the street. Yuck."
2,Digital Copy code is invalid,The Digital Copy code given does not work. I get invalid code error when I tried to do the Digital Transfer on both iTunes and Windows media player.
3,Borderline Kitsch but entertainment,"OK to enjoy this movie you need to turn off your brain and just well, sit back and enjoy it. This is a riotous, hyper-violent movie where the bad guys don't just lose, they get their butts kicked. The characters are lame but then again that is the point.The downside is that the characters are two-dimensional and almost lame they are so pure and righteous. The acting is dreadful and the script is just so lame that the good story telling is dragged down by the need to drop an F-Bomb every other word. I mean that this script seems to be written by 14 year old boys who think it is cool to swear. While that drags down the script, the performances do rescue it.All in all this is a fun movie. Watch it, but like I said, turn your brain off to enjoy!"
3,parody on being,"A half parody on heroic movies batman et al, a half tragic comedy of public tired so much of individual liberties somehow transformed into individual insecurity of modern urbanits looking wherever for whoever to protect them by falling from the skies.Not too good, not too bad."
3,What's Up With These Combo Packages?,"Does anyone understand the thinking behind these combo packs? I have a Blu-Ray player and so I have no use for the DVD version. And the person buying this for the DVD version can't play the Blu-Ray disc. I mean how stupid is this?Please, guys, cut the crap and give each person the version they will use. Maybe if you do that you can drop the price a couple of bucks and sell way more copies. I can't imagine having just a regular DVD player and having to pony up the bucks to cover a Blu-Ray disc that's included that I can't even play.Jeez get a freakin' clue.The movie, by the way, gets 4.5 stars. I'm minusing 1.5 stars for the idiotic packaging scam."
1,foul,A foul mouth little girl (GREAT!) This is what is wrong with movies today. NO MORALS. I question the morals of anyone who enjoys a little girl cussing and doing killing as enterainment. This is what's wrong with our youth today.
2,Nudity?,"I rented this expecting to see some skin; nudity was listed as an R rating. But through the whole film there are only two brief shots of cleavage and two other brief implied sex scenes. As a super hero movie, it's not a total waste, but where's the skin?"
1,A Piece of my Life I Will Never Get Back,We could not get through the first thirty minutes of this turd. I feel as if I am a lesser human being for lasting that long. I can't believe there are so many depraved people out there that would give this five stars. Clearly a sign of a declining society.
1,Obscene and depraved,"Hit Girl was the best part of this movie.I love watching little girls swear.I love watching little girls kill.I love watching men beat up little girls.And most of all, I love watching little girls holding big guns. It makes me feel like such a Big Daddy.What's wrong with all of you adults who love this movie? And what does this movie say about American culture, if the most vulgar and brutal superhero ever to ""grace"" the big screen is an 11-year-old girl? Kick-Ass is about as ""original and fresh"" as a beauty pageant with little girls made to parade around like ""sexy adults"" (such as the 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, who was, by the way, a victim of real violence).Update: Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl action figure dolls will be available in time for Christmas. Me, I'm hoping they'll come out with a Hit-Girl doll that swears when you punch, kick, and bite her. Can a doll be rated R? :-)"
1,I Need My Ass Kicked For Watching This Gah-bage,And NO Im not a super postive person who thinks somethings wrong with people for liking this movie because all of the violence and swearing. This movie started out pretty good & felt like the 1st Spider-Man movie but in reverse. It felt like one of those movies were you know its going to be a good movie BUT that ain't the case with this. After awhile this movie just got real boring and pointless. And I almost ALMOST!!! checked my watch as many times as I did when watching Avatar
1,Kick-Ass is only half right,"I know it's all supposed to be tongue in cheek and lots of fun, but frankly this turned my stomach. The select audience it is aimed for will thoroughly enjoy it while the rest of us will suffer through it."
4,Raw super hero movie,Not one to watch with the kids but was very entertaining. Seemed like a National Lampoonesque superhero movie. Very violent scenes were suprising - like Mortal combat almost.Fun to watch!
4,Funny like Zombieland,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's a little much to watch with teenagers - more sexual stuff than I would like. But, the movie is a lot of fun, dark and violent, but very funny and very crazy. Great sound track. I'm not going to do one of those reviews that tells you all about the movie. I'm just going to say if you like the funny/violent/cool/werid/quirky vibe - sort of funny like Zombieland vibe - you'll like this movie. I did, and watched it twice."
4,kicks a$$!,"funny, action filled and overall great flick. kind of movie you can watch over and over again. Chloe kicks a$$!"
4,Too funny and so wrong!,"Kick Ass is a movie that makes me question my decency, if not my sanity. This film is the most violence, brutal, crude, and juvenile film I would ever even consider watching, let alone buying or recommending. It is so wrong; so very, very wrong, and yet it's perfectly, deliciously dark and hilarious! Rewatch value is exceptional. I'd give it five stars, but I wouldn't respect myself in the morning. This film is too funny, too well-conceived and acted, and too cartoonish not to own on blu-ray! Video is colorful, slick, and gorgeous and the audio track matches in quality."
4,"Not what I expected...Good, though!","I was expecting a family movie where some kids were super heroes and it would be cute.WOW was I wrong!! Don't let kids watch it!Kids have decided to stop watching cimes and do something about it.The kids curse, ALOT!! Almost to the point where it's over-extensive. And the kids beat-up....no KILL evil guys. With blood and everything.The main kid is not a very good hero. But the little girl owns everyone with knives and guns.If you want to see a little girl kill people with knifes and have pleanty laughs in an adult movie, go for it."
1,Lions Gate will not honor digital copy!,"I just got my Blue Ray + DVD + Digital Copy in the mail today and discovered that Lionsgate is not being honest with their customers. Even though the Kick Ass digital package is still being sold and is advertised at a ""Featured Title with Digital Copy"" on Lionsgate's own website. They will not honor the codes and will not provide a digital copy. It appears that they have not been providing these copies since August of 2011.As much as I loved the movie (I would give the movie itself five stars)and await the sequel, I felt I needed to give this one star to let people know, they are wasting their money if they want to purchase this for the digital copy."
5,Delightful Surprise,"When I first heard of Kick-Ass, I thought it would be some stupid comic book movie spin off. I was very wrong. The movie is very enjoyable from start to finish. It's about a boy that dresses up as a super hero and goes around doing good deeds (such as finding lost cats) in a city of crime. He ends up getting caught up in something that is much bigger than him, getting framed by a father/daughter superhero gang for killing some mob members. It's a good story about growing into who you are, getting the girl.. Oh and there's a lot of killing. The movie is clever, funny, has some heartwarming moments, and is full of action. I know this is a short, and mostly info-less review, but the movie is awesome. I don't know how much extras the Blu-Ray version has, but I'm reviewing my movie, not the extra content. Definitely a purchase.BTW, this is the first movie with Nicolas Cage since Gone in 60 Seconds that I actually like him."
5,luved kick-ASS,"WOW! Should've watched this movie at the theater. Great movie, John Woo type action. Never expected the movie to turn out like this."
5,My favorite movie of 2010,The action scenes in this movie are amazing. It is violent and bloody but my 60 year old mother loved it. Hit Girl is the coolest character in any movie in a long time. Hopefully more people have seen it now that is has been on DVD and Blu Ray because it was criminally slept on in the movie theaters.
5,Thanks!,They sent me a messed up DVD and after I complained they were nice enough to send me a free replacement copy. :)
5,My review!,I fully expected this movie to suck. I was very surprised to find that it was extremely entertaining. It is a very unique film and has a great cast. It balanced the humor and drama like few movies can without destroyng the experience. It has a high re-watch value and could become a cult classic. There was no nudity and while the violence was almost excessive they did it without exploiting it. What I mean by that is they did not dwell on the violence. It was done in quick shots. Not gratutious at all. Loved this movie and look forward to seeing it again.
5,Outstanding,"After seeing the trailer, I thought this movie was going to be Napoleon Dynamite with a cape, but wow was I wrong. Kick-Ass was excellent on every level. Thrilling, funny, great acting and writing, wonderful characters.My only complaint is that they should have called it ""Hit Girl"", because she absolutely steals the show."
5,Great Movie,"I really wasnt sure what to expect with this movie, but after watching it all I can say is wow. This is definitely one of the better movies Ive seen in a long time. All the lead characters did a good job with Hit Girl as a big stand out. I really hope they do a sequel."
1,"Movie, excellent; disk, defective.","First, let me say that I had seen the movie and liked it so much so that I decided to buy the DVD for my collection. Unfortunately the disk would freeze for 3-15 minutes every time it changed chapters. I tried polishing the disk but to no avail. It was simply unwatchable. The disk (not the movie) doesn't even deserve the single star I gave it. If I can give you one piece of advice it would be to not make the mistake I did: I tossed the box so I could store the disk in my DVD wallet, rendering it non-returnable.Please, if anyone else has had a similar problem with this disk please speak up. This is too good a movie to be treated so shoddily."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078,"It wasn't what I expected. I thought it would be a fun mix of comedy and action, but it wasn't. It started out pretty good, but then it just went way over the top, filled with clique violence and often used catch phrases. It was predictable, all be it entertaining. If you were like me however, expecting anything more than just another shoot 'em up, blow 'em up, action film, you're gonna be disappointed."
3,ASS,LIKE I SAID AN ARTIST LIKE NICOLAS CAGE SHOULD PLAY IN BETTER SCRIPT MOVIES BUT WHAT EVER HE PLAYSIS GOOD
2,Saved by Hit Girl!,"Kick Ass is an ok movie. Everything about it is just average. Too many ""timely"" references like MySpace to make the movie hip I suppose?The real star of the movie is Hit Girl. Chloe Moretz is fantastic and her story is far more interesting then Kick Ass's story. A Hit Girl movie would be fun, and I think it shows a sidekick can work in a superhero film."
2,Unnecessary use of foul language,"The idea of the movie showed great potential but the execution of the plot was poor. A little girl being trained to be a heartless killer without care, what message does that send."
3,kick ass amazing blu ray,kick ass i have not seen the movie yet but the blu ray is amazing it comes with three disks and a very nice slip cover with nice special features but the movie it self i am not sure if it will turn to be very good but i read good previews about it
4,kick ass,I was intertained with this movie.It was not what I thought it would be. (a kid show)Not bad overall.
1,"Disturbing, tasteless, lacks anything redeeming","I like super hero movies, so the trailer for this one totally hooked me.The first ten minutes, setting up the premise, continued to hook me.Then came wave after wave of senseless dismemberment and murder, often at the hands of a disturbed 11 year old girl.In the end, I'd say the movie was tasteless, it had plenty of shock-and-awe-via-violence-and-gunfire-and-decapitation, but lacked an actually inspiring character, an actually moving story-line, or anything else that balances such portrayal of violence to actually uplift you ~ the way you often feel uplifted at the end of a super hero movie. Nothing like that here. I was just left disturbed.If you have kids of a conscience, or a love of good movies and inspiring human stories, stay away from this one."
2,Tarantino warmed over,"This film had potential (hence 2 stars and not 1) and there were moments (mainly near the beginning) when it seemed it would build toward something more than the usual banal action flick they churn out with depressing and increasing regularity these days. But as the ""plot thickened"" it fell back into that Hollywood default - when in doubt, add violence. When in doubt after that, increase the violence. If you or someone you love is the victim of violence: shock and horror. When you see it played out in a film like this with yet another bullet flying, yet another throat slashed: yawn."
5,even better on bluray,"This movie was not what I expected, having no prior knowledge of the comic, but I loved it.Hit Girl has got to be one of the best fictional characters ever. My wife found it a bit disturbing to have such foul language and violence coming from a young girl, but that was obviously the whole point. It's unexpected, hilarious and awesome, all at once.Hopefully the sequel is even half as entertaining."
2,la pelicula solamente,"Una lastima, una edicion de bluray tan cuidada, y tan dedicada, con tanto material extra, que NO TRAE subtitulos en español, ni siquiera en ingles. El Film si trae subs en español, pero no audio. Lastima porque la edición es simplemente excelente."
2,Kick ass,"I tried to look at this movie because I liked Aaron Johnson Taylor in Anna Karenina, but it had such fowl language I just could not watch it. The basic premise was used on Glee and I thought it was a very fun idea I hope Mr. Johnson will not limit his work to R rated movies."
5,Classic,"Funny, sick, violent, exciting, refreshing, Great !!!If you don't watch Kick-Ass, your life is not complete !Oh, Hit Girl is amazing, btw !"
5,Kick-Ass,I was channel surfing and saw it on. I told my nephew to watch it and he had to have a copy.
4,Movie: Kick Ass,"The movie itself was great. It is an action/comedy good for the whole family, as long as everyone is age 12 and up. This is because of the violence and vulgar language. The only problem I encountered was the server occasionally having to reconnect."
5,Awesome movie,This movie was great! It's kind of like a goofier version of Kill Bill. I would definitely recommend this movie.
4,What a Kick,"This film was certainly a pleasant surprise: a smart, funny superhero movie. What a concept!Really, the sharp script sets the tone here, but the acting and direction carry it along as well.Some of the digital effects look a little cheesy, but the headlong pace hustles the viewer past them in a blink.Otherwise the fight scenes are first rate, and little Hit Girl makes Go Go in ""Kill Bill"" look like a piker!A great villain, likable hero, and interesting secondary characters all make an impression as well.I have deducted a star only because this DVD has NO extras -- no commentary, making of, casting discussion, nada.This film deserves much better, and with any luck a tenth-anniversary edition will make amends. I'm sorry I'll have to wait ten years to add this to my collection!"
4,Kick Ass,"I first saw this movie in the theater at the time of its release. I enjoyed it enough to also purchase it in Blu Ray format. After watching it again, I have to say I found it just as entertaining as the first time. I know I will watch it again and continue to enjoy it every time I view it. I completely recommend it!!!!!"
5,NOT a kids movie,"First I've got to say I really enjoyed this wild violent flic, but I wonder who it's aimed at... way to violent for kids, but has teenaged and preteen heros... Either way, it Kicks @ss."
1,kick ass,"I thought the movie was something else. I did,t like the cursig with the young kids. Thee wasn,t the type of action that I thought it was."
3,kickass,Recieved product the blu ray case was cracked at the right top corner. Disc plays very well though it was just the case that had damage.
3,Don't know what the big deal was.,"The movie moved kinda slow and the way it progressed was a bit odd at times, yes it had some cool action scenes but a bit over the top especially with the little girl. People do take their kids to see these movies and expect the little girl to play with Barbie dolls, fall in love, or save a kitten out of a tree. Kind of like when I went to see Avatar and parents brought their little kids thinking it was a Disney or Pixar flik or something and then realized it was a bit too deep for the little ones! Don't know why people made such a big deal about this movie or why IGN gave it a 5 star rating saying ""wished they made all super hero movies like this"". Can't figure it out for the life of me."
3,"I liked it, but...","...does it not disturb anyone that mass entertainment now features sociopath 11-year-olds who shoot people in the head, face, etc.? We really are a depraved, decadent culture, just as much as the Romans were with their throwing the Christians to the lions.That said, this film kind of rocked."
3,Too Narrow,"The aspect ratio of 2.40:1 is too narrow for acceptable viewing on a normal television set, particularly if you have below average eyesight. Avatar and the Walt Disney films such as Toy Story 3 are 1.77:1 or 1.85:1 which is much better. If you zoom in on a 2.35: 1 picture you lose too much of the peripheral action. It would be great if there were 2 versions, one in 2.35:1 for those who like that format and one in 1.77:1 or 1.85:1 for those who prefer those formats."
2,trying to please too many,"it was an ok movie, nothing special. The movie was like a combination of sin city and kill bill geared toward kids and parents. I would not watch it again."
4,Different and Funny movie,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It was violent and funny; this may seen paradoxical, but the director made it work. Nicholas Cage's character, ""Big Daddy"" seems to be spoofing Adam West's ""Batman"" from the original TV series. Uh-oh I may be dating myself a bit. If you listen to how Cage talks, he seems to be aping West. This is basically a romantic comedy with the superhero stuff superimposed over it. Great directing."
5,This movie seriously kicks ass.,"When I first started to watch this movie, I didn't have high expectations because, well.....Nicholas Cage....but boy was I surprised. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie despite my reservations. The cinematography is immaculate."
2,it was just OK,"to mature for kids and to boring for adults.. tons of mayhem but Nicolas Cage does his normal ""phone in performance"" I wouldn't watch it again."
4,"Goodness, such language","The little girl in this movie must have aged 20 years during its filming. Language is so gross, it is unintentionally funny at times. A real gore-fest."
1,Kick-Ass DVD Blu-Ray Digital Copy,PO'd about the fact that my Digital copy arrived expired. There should not be an expiration on these things. We should be guaranteed of getting what we pay for. This is the second time this has happened. My Digital copy of The Wizard of Oz was expired too. I am paying for something I am not getting.
2,Yet to Arrive,"Well, I pre-ordered Kick-Ass and got the expensive have it at your house the day it comes out shipping.. Well guess what I have yet to have received it. Waste of fu&(ing cash. In no way does my rating, rate the actual movie. This movie is simply Awesome, I saw it with the guys then fell in love. Brought my little sister to even see it, because we have the same taste in movies."
1,Should Be Called Lame-Ass,"There's a reason this movie bombed at the box-office and was dubbed a major disappoinment--it SUCKS. Mostly boring; in fact I couldn't believe how boring most of it was. Lame ""hero"" (Kick-Ass) who does hardly anything and who you totally don't care about in anyway. A sterotypical ethnic ""goomba"" type mobster badguy who was SO sterotypical with his sterotypical henchmen they were like a bad joke. Barely any real ""story,"" and the thin thread of a story that there is is something you've see a billion times before--nerd likes hot girl, nerd ""kicks-ass"" and gets hot girl (yawn... are we asleep yet?). The only half-way decent thing about the entire drivel was Hit-Girl and Big Daddy. THEY were who the movie SHOULD have been about, but alas, the retarded film-makers made them nothing but nominal back-up characters who barely enter the story until the last act. Bottom line, if you expect this to be a good movie, sorry, it isn't. It's LAME-ASS."
5,It' KICKING!!,"Not a kids superhero movie, although a kid set this movie off. Great movie. When it first came out, I thought it was gonna be a lamemovie. After being convinced to give it a try, it was great. Not what I expected at all. I'm going to keep my eyes pealed for Hit Girlto do a solo sequel to this movie. My all means check it out."
4,Carelessly Funny and Entertaining,"I had some issues with this film. First, like most comic book hero movies, it's a world populated entirely by psychopaths, and heroes and villains kill each other senselessly and mercilessly while teaching their children and their audiences that it's right to do so. Second, the hero of this movie -- Kick-Ass -- as he calls himself is a dumb-ass, and it's hard to maintain cool and composure when he continues to make bad stupid decisions (he's more like a plot device than he is an actual character).But despite its deep permanent inherent flaws ""Kick-Ass"" can be at times riveting and even cathartic. What makes this movie sing aloud is ""Hit-girl,"" and there's something wondrous and inexplicably uplifting about a cute eleven-year old girl who dresses like a Japanese cartoon character yet is also a master assassin. ""Hit-girl"" makes up for all the film's flaws, even the film's repugnant amorality."
4,Great Movie,"Does an ok job of sticking to the story in the comic, but would have liked to see it stick to canon."
4,Kick Ass... kicked ass?,"This movie was thoroughly entertaining and looks gorgeous on BluRay. Absolutely worth the money, especially considering the three copies you get."
3,Movie was much more violent than expected,"I'm not exactly a guy whose sensitive to violence, but this movie is a bit over the top, and the plot line actually has you disgusted with one of the main protagonists (Nicholas Cage). Its a mildly entertaining action flick, but has limited replay value."
4,GREAT!!,"at first i didn't want to watch this because i thought it would be cheesy...but it wasn't. it was actually pretty good due to the fact that it wasn't a typical superhero movie. the colors, graphics, costumes, characters and the comic like way is fantastic.i def. recommend this movie to all..maybe not so much kids because it can be a little bloody."
5,Sweet!,As a mom of three teenagers I was less than thrilled to rent this one on the kids promise that it was supposed to be awesome. Surprise! It was! We all loved it. I'll be ordering this one immediately on blu-ray.
5,"Great movie, fast shipping, wonderful condition","I actually ordered this movie 2 days after I ordered another and it got to my house before the other one. It's in great condition, almost new, in fact it still had some of the movie plastic wrap stuck to the side, no scratches or anything. I love this movie and have been a fan since it came out, i cant wait for kick-ass 2 to come out this summer!"
5,Why is the digital copy dragging?,"Love this movie, it is quite comical. I downloaded the digital copy to my i-tunes account. On my iPod Classic it plays great. However, on my brand new lap-top the movie stops frequently, it feels like is streaming, and sometimes skips a few frames repeatedly :(. The blu-ray is great. I play it on my Samsung BD-P3600 and my Samsung UN55B6000, and my Yamaha RX-V 1065 which all can be controlled with my Samsung remote. It is quite amazing when I play it in my system. The digital copy quality could have been better."
3,"Good fun & ""Hit Girl"" make it worth while","Having not read the comic, I went into this w/ no expectations. Ultimately, the movie is entertaining for a Fri. Nite. But I would have liked less cardboard villians and more hit girl, the most interesting character."
3,Entertaining,"This movie was entertaining and full of surprises. The caracter that you least expect to steal your attention in this movie, does just that."
4,The Doctor's first away mission,"When Harry, Chakotey and Tuvok disappear on the holodeck the Doctor is the only one who can be send to rescue them. It will be his first away mission: a special occacion, and not without hazard, since the safety limits are offline. The episode takes place in the time of Beowulf, with Vikings, desperate Kings,. monsters and fighting maidens. The Doctor has ample opportunity to show his poetic, romantic and valiant sides. Some scenes are very funny. Especially those where the Doctor,with his dry comments, intellect en photons interacts with the medieval supersticious Vikings. This is surely one of the better episodes for the Doctor."
2,Beautiful song,"This is my favorite new song for the summer. It make s you want to dance , sing and fall in love all at the same time. I am a big Lucas Prata fan and cannot wait to see what next from him."
1,"Bland, run-of-the-mill pop","These songs have absolutely no attraction to them whatsoever, and nothing to make them stand out from the countless piles of rubbish that are being spat out by one-hit pop wonders, trying to make as much money as they can before their fifteen minutes of fame runs out and they are replaced by the next pretty boy / girl."
2,Not What I Thought,"The first Lucas Prata song I ever heard was ""& she said"" which was a great dance track. This song pales in comparison. It is OK as a pop song attempting to be a dance song, but really belongs on the radio, not the dance floor."
3,disappointing,"I love Rogers and Hammerstein, but this collection was not the best. The singing and song choices were not what I would get again."
3,Not what I expected.,"I have read translations by Daniel Ladinsky before and expected this to be as sharp and witty as previously. But I do admit, this might be the result of his choice of poems. The originals for this book might have been less edgy than others he could have chosen. In that sense, the translations could be spot on. I do not know. But it still is a thought provoking read."
3,Ladinsky poems masquerading as Hafiz,"People should be aware that Daniel Ladinsky writes his own original poems, which are inspired by Hafiz, and then calls them ""poems by Hafiz"". Ladinsky does not translate Hafiz, and his poems do not resemble the legitimate works of Hafiz. THIS IS NOT A COLLECTION OF HAFIZ. They are beautiful poems in their own right, but they are marketed under a deceptive pretense. By all means, read the poems that Hafiz actually wrote."
4,Confused by question of intellectual property,"Landinsky has been described as a reinterpretor of Hafiz' poetry, and that these represent more his own writings than any of Hafiz's compositions. Yet the book is also presented as a representation of Hafiz's writings. This is an important LEGAL question, because we, the readers, are left without information about whether it is permissible to quote these writings in print of public performance. If they are the writings of Hafiz, they are about 650 years old and public domain. If they are Landinsky's own words, decorated with the Hafiz name for status, then it's altogether a different matter. Landinsky, you haven't made this easy. We need to know if this is YOUR work, or Hafiz's. Carify, could you?"
4,black like us,This book is informative and a excellent history book. I recommend this book for anyone who is insterested in learning about the rich black gay history.
2,wrong part,I ordered tge part with it saying in the caption that it would fit a 1981 chevy citation and it doesn't.simple put I wasted 20 dollars
4,Bashir I Presume,"It was a very good episode because we finally got to find out why Bashir kept beating O'Brian in darts. Other than that i like the idea of a hologram of Bashir, espeacially because Zimmerman who was creating the promgram himself, is the EMH for all starships. I thought it was a good episode. When it's available i'll probably buy it."
3,Made in China,"This ""unique product from a unique American company"" is made in China. While the idea is good, and I will be using it, the quality of the material is mediocre. also the cap doesn't close well."
1,Please dont associate the name Tolkien with this,"As a lover of Professor Tolkiens lifelong labour in Middle Earth, it saddens me to a great extent to see what the Professor himself feared might happen, coming true in a waste of paper such as this. Tolkien himself loathed most attempts at film productions of his work because they fell short of his vision of his masterpiece. No doubt the professor would have seen something like this to be a grossly regrettable misuse of something that has brought many so much joy for so many years. I cannot believe that the Tolkien Estate would authorize garbage like this to bear the name Tolkien. I believe i speak for Tolkien fans worldwide when i ask you to not associate the name Tolkien with garbage like this. Leave that to 900 psychic numbers and smoky palm reading dens. I guess the Professor shows even more of his eminent vision in his fear of predators seeking to exploit for personal gain something that took a lifetime to create."
1,0 stars if that was an option.,"Okay, I completely agree with the other reviews on this book in that it is completely garbage. I wouldn't buy it if you gave me $100. It's just totally out of the question! I don't see how anyone could publish this(word that I won't write). Just because Tolkien isn't living anymore, doesn't mean people can take advantage of his woks! Pathetic. Thats all I have to say. Pathetic."
2,A reply to Duckime's review below,"I have NOT seen this Tarot deck, so I can not refute Duckime's comments about the book and cards in his review below.Duckime stated that the Tarot was developed by Catholics is in error. It was the Kabbalists of the 14th century (if memory serves) that invented the Tarot.Here is the major points of my argument.1. the four suits (Cups, Pentacles, Swords and Wands) represents the four elements.2. The suits are numbered from 1 (ace) to ten. There are 10 sephiroth (spheres of consciousness) on the Tree of life.3. There are 22 major arcana. There are 22 letters in the Jewish alphabet, and there are 22 paths interconnecting the 10 sephiroth on the tree of life.4. There are four face cards of each suit. The Kabbalah teaches the universe began with 10 dimensions, then the upper 6 dimensions collapsed and leaving a universe of 4 dimensions (Height, Width, depth, and time).Thank you for your time and attention. Two Bears."
1,A Dissapointment,"Those who have read biographies about Professor J.R.R. Tolkien would know that if he were living he would be absolutley abhorrent of this book. Tolkien was a very religious person, and his religion was Catholic, which is completely against tarot cards. This is the kind of thing that would make him turn-over in his grave. I'm sure that a lot of Tolkien fans would agree with me in saying that Tolkien Enterprises has stooped pretty low in using Tolkien tarrot cards. If Tolkein were alive and knew about this he would be greatly angered. So, please, to all you fans of Tolkien out there, and those who respect his ideas, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! IT IS COMPLETELY AGAINST WHAT TOLKIEN STOOD FOR! There are many other good Tolkien books so go check it out for yourself."
3,Stablemate Fun Foals,"I know that this is a nice set, however, I never received it !! It was supposedly sent by UPS ground and was supposedly left on my porch, but it was not."
2,A single without anything new,"2 brothers on the 4th floor have during the 90's managed to get a name in the 'euro-dance'. Trough several singles such as 'never alone', 'dreams', and 'fairytales' just to name a few they have shown that they really CAN make songs that the people and most likely their fans enjoy listening to and dancing to. unfortunately this single don't give us anything new, nothing that we haven't heard them doing before, except for the title, the melody and the text. everything else is exactly as they were when they first started. and by doing that, you feel like they think that the time hasn't gone since their first single.Only real fans of 2 brothers on the 4th floor, who has all the singles would/should be interesting in this cd. cause this song hasn't got anything new. it is old euro-dance (from the early 90's) nothing else!hopefully the album that's coming, most likely in the fall this year will give us something NEW!"
3,3 1/2 *'s for a well-told tale with missing pieces,"The author presents an enjoyable, well-researched account of the emergence, identification and handling of killer viruses. He provides an explanation of viruses as biological entities and goes on to contrast their destructive potential with the faltering infrastructure that even the affluent nations have to deal with them.Needed is a more precise targeting of text to the generalist audience; his biological treatises can be a bit much. Also needed is more extrapolation on what the viruses' killer potential might mean for mankind and potential remedies or alleviatives -- which is what the book advertises itself as addressing."
4,The human side of pandemics,"Virus X details actual virus caused pandemics. It gives the how and why of the spread of virus caused diseases. It also relates personal anecdotes from scientists and victims of these diseases. Although it's an older book, it's well worth reading. I came away with the knowledge that viruses are mankind's greatest predator. I've written a scifi novel in which an alien species manipulates viruses to eliminate human beingsA Benwarian Fix: The Intercolonization of Earthusing the understanding I gained from the book."
4,loaded with information,"This book was a tough read, mainly because of all the technical details. If you can slog through the heavy read, the theories and concepts in the book are very interesting and fuel for thought."
4,A Nice Winter Distraction,"I bought this game for my husband for Christmas and it was well worth the $12.99 price. I've been enjoying it myself! There are multiple slopes, races, and racers to choose from and I felt it was easier to master the controls than some other PS2 games. The graphics are good and the race commentors are occassionally funny. All in all and enjoyable game and a great distraction when there is no snow on the ground and you are unable to hit the slopes yourself."
1,What a piece of crap......,"I bought these boots hoping they would be tough enough to last, my last pair of boots lasted me a year and a half, these lasted three weeks. From the first week the black started chipping off the front and the inside started crumbling while I wore the boot, making it very uncomfortable. On the second week the eyes(the holes you put the laces through)started falling out. And on the third week, the real quencher was on the third week, the went to take the boots off and the bottom of the boot ripped off, just off. I couldn't believe I spent thirty dollars on boots that lasted only three weeks. My last pair were only thirty and like I said lasted a year and a half."
3,"Enjoyable, but not a key season one episode","I enjoyed this episode, but I must admit that it didn't do much to develop the Voyager characters...something that should have been a focus of season one of the series. Perhaps we did get a small glimpse into the spirituality of the character of Chakotay...but even that glimpse was small and could have been a lot more revealing.In short, the episode is worth seeing, but the writers could have done alot more within the storyline to flesh out the characters...especially the characters of B'Elanna and Chakotay.I'd say that this episode is enjoyable, but it's certainly not a season one ""must see""."
4,Wonderfully fun,"Vatch's Thai Street Food gave me a more quick and simple recipe guidebook for some of my favorite Thai recipes. They were easy to follow and tasty to eat! One of the most beautifully translated dishes was the ""Steamed fish with Chili paste"" or the Oo pla, I steamed white fish in beautiful little banana cups (the cups I had made the night before) and presented them to some guests to their excitement and pleasure. The presentation was gorgeous and they were a hit. Recipes are also categorized by region (North, By the Sea, Around Bangkok, etc.) with a bit of interesting history to some dishes which I always love to learn about. Great coffee table book as well, pictures are colorful and beautifully presented."
5,His best work,"Strip away the big band, vivacious backing vocals and sometimes amusing lyrics and Lyle Lovett is still one heck of a songwriter and singer. This CD proves it -- and is probably his finest work. Simple, mellow, yet profound, its perfect Saturday morning listening music. Enjoy with your favorite coffee and pajamas."
3,Probably the weakest Lyle Lovett CD,"I'll start by saying that I love everything Lyle puts out to some degree. I own every cd and listen to him almost daily. This is the one I listen to the least. It seems to lack any central theme, or mood. The upbeat songs just aren't that catchy and the more somber material just not that evocative.I recommend any other Lyle release over this one. Particularly overplayed in my collection are ""Pontiac"", ""Road to Ensenada"" and the incredible and diverse ""Step Inside This House"". Buy this one last to round out your collection."
5,Best Lyle Lovett CD!,"This one is my favorite of all Lyle Lovett CD's. Almost every song is a gem! The wit of ""Record Lady,"" the grace of ""I Think You Know What I Mean.,"" the sharpness of ""Skinny Legs"" or the absurdity and fun of ""Skinny Legs""...it's all gold, as you will find out when you buy or borrow ""I Love Everybody.""We need more original songwriters like Lyle. He may be a loner, but he carries some profound messages."
3,Songs from Lyle's attic,"Lyle Lovett is one of my favorite performers of all time and I honestly believe it is not possible for there to be a bad Lovett CD. That being said, ""I Love Everybody"" is good--but not my favorite Lovett CD. If like me, you really like Lyle, get this CD. On the other hand, if you are fonder of his later more complex music, give the CD a listen before you buy.Aside from ""Penguins"" which I really love, the two songs that I consider standouts are ""Skinny Legs"" which talks about jealousy and ""Hello Grandma"" which is a call to a relative of an ex-girlfriend. Both have Lyle's typical wit and wisdom."
2,Should have left these on the shelf,"This album came out after the Julia marriage, and I feel it was a rush to capitalize on the publicity since it brought to market songs previously left off records. It seems like a collection of songs created while sitting on the porch being silly. It's fun the first time through, but once IS enough."
1,Too simple for this fan,"As a long-time Lyle Lovett fan, I looked forward to buying album when it came out. Then I had the opportunity to listen to many of the cuts while on a long flight across the US. I quickly changed my mind. The tunes and lyrics are simple, and most lack the wit and subtlety of his later work (these song were written early in his career).For a great overview of Lyle's work, check out more recent ""Live in Texas"". Only one song, ""Penguins"", from this release makes it on the live CD."
2,Lyle on autopilot,"This is not a very good album. I mean, sure, it sounds okay, but it has no heart... Overly-whimsical, with stick-figure novelty tune like ""Fat Babies,"" ""Penguins"" and ""Record Lady"" that verge on mere nonsense. I hate to be blunt, but this record seems like a tossoff -- Lyle has a sassy way of singing and he can project enough 'tude to seem like he's got everything all figured out, but there doesn't seem to be any ""there"" there... You definitely get the sense that Lovett's heart wasn't in it for this one, moreso than on any of his other albums. It sounds pleasant enough, but nothing sticks."
1,Disappointing - not at all what I expected,"I bought this CD based on these very reviews on Amazon.com. I have to admit I only listened to it once and found it slow and dirge-like and I am not sure I want to risk the agony of a second listening. Was disappointed because I LOVED ""Pontiac."""
1,total shame to the music business,"I actually listened to this just because some girl who was his fan said that The Opposite of Sex wasn't his level, that the movie sucked, and that he (Lovett) should stick to singing. His songs suck, not to mention the fluff lyrics which sound like baby tales. The tunes are overused and completely unoriginal. But then again, if he wouldn't have done the Opposite of Sex, I would never have heard of him. and he did good THERE... so good luck to this Lovett guy in whatever he does, I just hope that for his sake not all his fans are as ignorant and ridiculous as the ""viewer from Cicely, Alaska"" who wrote ""An Open letter to Lyle Lovett"" in January 7, 1999 by reviewing The Opposite of Sex. -Oren"

4,Magic the Gathering,"The book ""Magic the Gathering Official Strategy Guide"" to be very helpful in how to play the game against other players."
4,MTG OSG Good Read,This book was a great book and a great read. Even though they did alot of there deminstrations with Fifth addition cards you can take all of what they say and bring it over to the new sets. I would highly recomend this to any one who is just starting out with the game. And also to any sesoned game player.
4,good but not as good as he can be,"i thought that this was a bit of a let down, soopafly has been really good when featured on other DPG albums and snoops album etc, but he was not upto his usual greatness on this one, its worth a listen, but really not top quality. maybe it was the production?"
1,WHAT UP!!!,"I'm a big DPG fan,and i was so excited when this album came out.But when i got it home and listened to it,i felt really let down.The production is very weak!!!If you like your DPG G-Funk,you won't like this album.Soopafly should of got the legendary west coast producer Battlecat to produce his album then it would of been a DPG classic.I'm sorry my dog,but this really is s**t!!!"
5,Thanks for carrying these Amazon!,"These Kuhn Rikon Wisks are really nice, made very well, will last a long time and they are very sturdy. The best one's I have ever seen, very well worth the extra money."
5,Great!,Looked all over for these locally and could not find for my daughter. Very happy! Only improvement would be if they were individually wrapped.
2,GETS LOST IN ITSELF TOO EASILY,"I have heard a variety of soundtracks by many different people and I must say that Thomas Newman's soundtracks are the strangest. He sometimes finds a nice melody but frequently loses it again in a mess of sounds. The CD starts out nice but quickly falls into non-melodic songs that make no sense to me what-so-ever. I'm afraid to admit that the only song I found enjoyable on the CD was ""Por Una Cabeza"" which is not even written by him. When I first heard that song in the movie during the famous tango scene, I couldn't wait to hear it again on the soundtrack and hoped the rest of the CD would be as good. I was very disapointed in the melody lacking soundtrack. The only reason why I give it two stars is because of the tango song. I just have one thing to say. I'm glad that I borrowed it from a friend first and didn't waste my own money on it."
3,"Newman is On and Off, as Usual","Scent of a Woman is 50% of a truly great film score...and 50% of a truly bad film score. It's obvious to the listener from which category a particular track comes from. Newman either gives the listener a vibrant, exciting, ""new age"" melody, or something that can only arguably be defined as music.The fact remains, however, that when this score is on, it is REALLY on. The Main Title is an exciting track and the more emotional themes can really grab you by the heartstrings (though they undoubtedly hearken back to other works by Newman).All in all though, for anyone familiar with Newman, two other scores better exemplify his talents. If you are looking for the unorthodox, ""new age"" Newman, go with American Beauty. If it's lush strings and sentiment you're after, go with Meet Joe Black (my personal favorite Newman score to date). Both will leave you with a much better idea of this talented composer."
5,Wonderful tango selection,"I saw this film and bought this CD just to hear the wonderful tango,""Por Una Cabeza"" and can still see the famous scene from ""Scent of A Woman.""I enjoyed the rest of the film music as well."
5,Oddly sized rear wiper blade-perfect fit!,"I was so pleased that Amazon carried this strange size for wiper blades that fits the rear wiper for my Ford Escape. I looked online at numerous car sites to find this size, with NO LUCK. Amazingly, Amazon carries this size and it fit perfectly."
3,"Just OK, could be better","The wiper went on without any problem. It looks to be solidly made and looked a lot like the one I replaced. I've got a 2002 Ford Escape and my only problem with it is that part of the rear windshield doesn't get wiped... On the top of the rear window, the glass curves away a bit toward the roof... it just doesn't get up there. To be fair my last wiper didn't either. I'm guessing you have to get a Ford-made replacement to get up there."
4,Good Replacement,This wiper blade in a hard to find size was a good replacement for the factory installed blade.At 10 inches it was an inch shorter than the original but adequate nonetheless. This is my onlyreason for deducting one star.The website provides a video to show how to install. Installation was easy and quick without tools.I wish I had orderd two as the shipping charge would have been the same.
4,Simplicity,"As a whole, this book is a good introduction to logical thinking in the martial arts - in it's principles it shows good methods of determining which action is the best to take at any time.Even if you've only done a couple of classes of Wing Chun, the pictures will make sense - it contains photos of the Sil Lum Tao Form, the first empty-hand form of Wing Chun.Overall a good read that gets the point across without sounding overly technical."
4,These jeans are of good quality,"I have bought these jeans for my tall, skinny son twice. He likes the way they fit, but I like the way they last (many washings)."
5,A Great Sampler!!,"If you don't know what smooth jazz music is all about, then you must pick this CD up! This has all the elements of what a smooth jazz radio station playlist has. Light sounds, soothing vocals and memorable performances. The folks at Shanachie Records compiled a great CD of their artists. This is just as good as the KKSF AIDS benefit samplers. Buy it!!"
1,MISREPRESENTED as an original recording. IT IS NOT!!!,"THIS IS A BAD COPY OF THE ORIGINAL RECORDING. AT MOST, THIS VENDOR SHOULD BE SELLING THIS IN mp3 FORMAT. YOU SHOULD NOT ALLOW THIS TO CONTINUE AND REMOVE VENDOR AND ITEM FROM YOU OFFERTS!!!! I EXPLANED THIS WHEN I RECEIVED THE ITEM, BUT UNFORTUNALLY I CAN SEE YOU HAVE NOT ACTED ON THE INFORMATION I GAVE YOU THEN!!!VICTORIA GARCIA"
4,Best Mouse I've Ever Owned,"Out of all the mice I've ever owned, this one is, by far, the best. Having been the first mouse I've ever owned that did not need a ball, I was quite impressed by the smooth tracking of the laser-no more skipping mouse ball! Because I travel often to clients my ""mousing surface"" is not always my trusty clean and gel padded mouse pad... so, I used to have to clean the inside of my mouse every two weeks in order to keep the tracking smooth. It is nice not to have to do this anymore and I can even ""mouse around"" smoothly using my bed as my mousing surface when I am using my laptop in bed. Also, unlike most mice which are covered entirely by plastic, this mouse is a bit rubberized in two places which provides for an enjoyable tactile feeling... and as for some of the reviews which make comments about the ""cool blue"" light making your palm warm, this has never happened to me. Forget about all the other mice out there, get this one and you won't be disappointed."
2,great mouse bad drivers,"The drivers for this sleek and comfortable mouse lack tremendously. In the past couple of months, I have constantly lost one or another function of the mouse at random. After updating the drivers many times and after reinstalling them I achieve full function but only for a short time. Now the question is why buy this mouse if you can't make use of all the functions?! Of course an optical mouse is a great improvement over the former mechanical ones, but you have alternatives to this specific one.I have purchased a similar product (an optical mouse) by Kensington and it works on pc as well as mac without problems and has as many programable buttons."
4,Fantastic,"I like this mouse, it's thrid button has nice features and great touch. This optical technology is something great !"
5,Deep Space Nine at its best,"In The Cards became an instant fan favorite and an example as to why Deep Space Nine was the last best hope for the Star Trek franchise. Jake and Nog engage a quest to find a vintage Willie Mays baseball card in an effort to lift Sisco's spirits. The ensuing adventure has the boys meeting a bizzare scientist trying to halt cellular decay and a face-to-face confrontation with Weyoun. This episode serves as a jumping-off point for the beginning of the Dominion war. Overall, a great Star Trek story that sees little rerun airtime and is a must for any fans video collection."
5,"Neva's Review - ""Your Inner Child of the Past""","This Book, ""YOUR INNER CHILD OF THE PAST,"" helped Heal me of my Childhood Issues.I Learned SO MUCH from this Book! Having learned these Insights, gave me the Tools I needed, to work out my healing.I encourage anyone who has Childhood Issues, to buy this book and work with it.I have the Inner Peace I've always wanted, because My Inner Child is NOW at Peace.Sincerely,Neva"
4,Is Neelix gonna die?,"With the annoyance that Neelix's character seemed to cause pretty much everyone else on the ship, I thought this is the episode that he would leave the show.An alien with a disease called the ""Phage"" steals Neelix's lungs and graphs them into this own body. After hunting down the lung theft, Janeway demands the organs back, only to find out he's already using them. Kes offers to give Neelix one of her lungs, the alien offers to perform the surgery using their advanced technology to modify organs from 2 unlike species.This was a good episode, but I feel that the plot was a little weak. Most episodes have a major story line and a couple of minor ones, as well as the other 'day to day' ongoing struggles. This one seemed the lack the minor conflicts."
2,Great music - [bad] master,"This CD is a GREAT selection of Ray Stevens stuff...however, the master is horrible. The main thing that stands out is the fact this sounds very compressed, I'm not sure what Mr. Meadows did when he mastered it, but, somewhere along the line, a bad analog source was used or he dynamically compressed it. Try some of the other Greatest Hits CD's"
5,Young JFK,This was a piece of this mans youth many didn't know and it helps round out the person he became and perhaps why it helps that Patrick Dempsey did a remarkable job playing young Kennedy worth the watch
3,a HART Attack,"This is no Bonanza!I bought this box set of the limited adventure show, Hart of the West. It started both Beau and Lloyd Bridges.The one joke idea of a man buying a ranch after a mid life crisis is not fleshed out in these fifteen episodes, The towns people seem this side of Northern Exposure and they don't workBennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD"
4,I Loved the program in the 90s,"This was a favorite back when, but I never saw all the episodes before. Now I can, and it's still as funny as it was in 1993/1994. The disk is reasonably arranged in a set of 3, and quality is OK, except for a few hick-ups, mostly in the audio tracks. My only peeve is that DVD makers nowadays seem to insist on adding 30 minutes of advertising material at the front of the disk that cannot be skipped over."
1,These are all the same,"Whether it's the 'Left Behind' series, (such a charming title), or 'Countdown to Doomsday' or any of the other blood and thunder books, you can count on one thing: God is mad as hell at all of us, (except the 'chosen') and is going to unleash a fury against his archenemy Satan. The great cosmic battle will be played out at Armeggedon where Satan and God will will duke it out in front of the whole world. Well, most of the world. The elect will be taken by rapture into Heaven safely ensconced away from the raging, bloody battle.Eventually, most of the world will be tossed into a flaming, eternal pit of torture for an eternity, while the saved get to look down on the agony of the unsaved and stick their tongues out: nyah-nyah! I just wonder if when Hagee sees Christ he will yell JJJJEEEEEEZSZZZZUUUUUUUSSS like he does on television.And all this mind you, in the name of the Prince of Peace."
5,Book Review,This was another fine example of Pastor John Hagee's literary prowess. He is such a gifted author and I truly appreciate his writings. I have developed a voracious appetite for his books that address Biblical Prophecy and all Spiritual type materials. Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!
5,from Daniel to Doomsday,"good book, written by a master of knowledge about theBible. Very believable. Very informative. Would recommend this to anyone who is interested in how things are falling into place. This was sent in good condition in a timely manner and i would certainly recommend this seller."
1,Olympus Camera 170,This camera was a piece of garbage - pics came out blurry and with spots - customer service was lousy and did NOTHING to correct the problem - BIG headaches!!! Will NEVER purchase another ANYthing made by Olympus again!
2,"Appears to be a good book, but there are many errors in it.","This book for the most part seems to be a good teaching tool, however there are errors in the math assessment given at the end of the lessons. There are two problems given that they have solved incorrectly. Also, the answer key is not very useful as several of the answers given are incorrect. One problem in the test asks for the perimeter of a rectangle, however the answer key gives the answer for the area of the rectangle. It takes up too much time to have to verify which answers are correct in the book and which are incorrect. It makes me question the quality of the content of the rest of the book."
3,Too much for this homeschool mom,"I bought 4 books to start this school year with my 5th grader. I am considered an ""ecclectic"" homeschool teacher. I like to make my own lesson plans and change up the cirriculum to fit my children. This book is really structured. It reminds me too much of traditional school and the boring lessons. I am planning on using some of the lessons but not many. It does give you plenty of ""teaching"" material. In my opionion its a little intense."
3,Not what I was looking for...,The details about it were misleading and I ended up returning it. It would be useful if I was looking for lesson plan ideas but I wasn't.
3,A Good Primer,This is a good introduction to becoming a good poker player. Most of the info is basic knowledge but it's good to hear it explained by Phil. I did find it a little bit tedious watching Phil play out 4 other player hands when trying to make a point though. It would have been much better to have other people at the same table while Phil explained instead of having him try to juggle 4 different hands at the same time. I would have also helped in fleshing out the different player types he describes early on. All in all a good lesson for a begginer.
4,Per-Fit briefs - 1st time user,First time using these (on my mom). The quality is pretty good. I think overall they are a good buy for the money. They are a little thinner than what I am able to get at Sam's club. But for the price they are definately acceptable.
3,Home Town Long Island by BILLY JOEL?,This book is informative. I was disappointed because it has been advertised everywhere as a book about Billy Joel and his life in Long Island. In fact this book is about Long Island and has write ups about many different celebrities from L.I. and history of Long Island. It states on the cover that the foreward is by Billy Joel. If you are interested in L.I. this book is EXCELLENT (5 stars ). If you are looking for a book on Billy Joel you can bypass this purchase (1 star ).
5,Lots of TV fun...,"Am watching the series for the first time. I got to see an occasional episode when I was a kid but bedtimes and homework and studying usually ran interference...This is the first season where CBS must have come to conclusion that ""sex sells"" because in the first 5 episodes I have seen so far Thomas Magnum has caught the girl and then spent the night with her. Previous to this there was the suggestion that he spent the night with her, now it is confirmed.We were watching the series as a family b/c it was adventurous but still pretty tame compared to what is on broadcast TV these days. This is the season where I'll have to watch it after the kids go to bed.Still really enjoying the series and the story lines. The places and the cars are really interesting. The plots would never work as well if Magnum carried a cellphone!!! While our gadgets have much improved, the world really hasn't changed that much since this show was originally broadcast."
5,Magnum PI Sixth Season,I rec'd the complete set and was very pleased there were no problems with any of the discs. Shipping time was good.
4,More Magnum for me!!,"Very good. This in addition to my first 5 seasons. It is interesting to watchchanges to this series as it progresses...as in changes are probably madeto compete for ratings at the time(early 80's). Some episodes are farfetchedwith Magnum,TC,Rick and Higgins being as commandos as in A Team.Enjoyable entertainment and easy to watch TV."
1,Bad Ink,"I have an Epson Stylus C86. These are the correct cartridges for my printer, but they failed to print. Instead of black, I got a pale grey with lots of patches. After a handful of pages, it was nearly white. I found this ink to be unusuable."
5,I learned alot!,"Before I read this book my image of Lottie Moon was simply of a virtuous woman who served Jesus in China. Since reading the book I learned she was a genius with a brilliant brain who was very bold, outspoken, and brave. She was extremely loyal to her Saviour and couldn't understand why most people weren't willing to serve the Lord like she did."
5,"Perfect Fit, Works Like A Charm","When shopping for replacement parts for an older grill, one worries about ""does if fit, etc."" This part worked perfectly on my 2002 model of a Sam's Club Member's Mark grill."
4,Help! Jake's Trapped in a Movie Star's body!,"When snobby-loved by all actor Erie Lake comes to town, everyone is excited... except Jake. Erie hates his job and swithces bodies with Jake. Jake starts taking a limo to school, and is surrounded by girls, cameras, and fans. Jake learns that he's a really good actor, and Erie gets jealous. Majorly. He wants to keep his old body, and never switch again. But will Jake agree?"
4,Help! I'm trapped in a Movie Star's Body,"This book is great. This book is about a boy name Jake. Jake is an ordinary kid,but when famous actor,Eric Lae comes to town everything changes.Directors from Hollywood come to Jake's school looking for a boy so Eric Lae can copy to practice for his role in his movie.When Jake has been chosen and Eric stays at his house Jake tells him about the mini-dits which transports someone into somebody else's body.Jake tells him to switch bodies since Eric is not happy with eating healthy food,exercising every day for long periods of time. When Jake is Eric and Eric is Jake, Eric in Jake gets jealous that Jake in Eric is a better actor.Eric in Jake wants to trade bodies back but Jake likes his life as an actor.It takes the whole book so Eric can have his body back."
2,Not That Good,"This book wasn't that good. It has a corny ending, they use the word ""said"" too much, and they have boring details that are not particularly interesting. It was an ok idea that just wasn't delivered in an interesting manner. It was easy to read and the vocabulary was limited."
5,"""That's Starfleet for 'Get out!'""","Just one of the many great lines in this very good episode. Best one was during the scene where the crew is playing pool.Gary (to Torres): ""Now me, I have a whole different approach to women: Treat a lady like a tramp and a tramp like a lady. Never fails""Torres: ""Paris, did you program this guy.""Paris: ""Yeah, why?""Torres: ""He's a pig. And so are you.""I enjoy the growing interaction among the crew evident in this episode. ""Voyager"" did more of this in just a handful of episodes in its first season than the other ""Treks"" did in several years.However, the central plot -- exploring a nebula which really turns out to be a lifeform -- is pretty much standard ""Trek"" stuff. A little contrived, as usual, but still good fun."
4,There's coffee in that nebula!,"This episode of Voyager did a pretty good job of developing the entire ensemble cast that come to be the focus of the show, and for that reason, I highly recommend it.A couple of memorable Voyager quotes (""There's coffee in that nebula!"") come from this episode, and there is some important character development going on with regard to Janeway and Chakotay especially.Of particular interest is the developing relaxed relationship between the Captain and the First Officer. It is a significant development that Janeway has become comfortable enough with Chakotay to ask him to help her meet her animal guide. And in return, that Chakotay appears eager to expose his mystical side to the Captain.The scenes in the holosuite bar (Sandrines)are fun and set the stage for many scenes to come in the Voyager series. And it's good to see Janeway ""let her hair down"" and be one of the gang!"
3,An OK Show,"The central premise of ""The Cloud"" cannot be calledoriginal. The USS Voyager is low on power and they detect a powersource in a nearby nebula. They blast their way through many obstacles while trying to reach the power source. ""Cloud"" gets some recommendation thanks to some lively characters. The show has a few interesting character moments, but make no mistake, ""Cloud"" is basically about the dialouge. The show has some nice wit to it and some other nice comedic moments (look for a good Neelix impersonation of Janeway). I guaruntee you will be entertained--once. I don't really think this show ages well, because the second time I saw it, it had lost some of its magic, mainly due to the silly Misunderstood Lifeform plot. If you'd like a well realized character piece with a nice plot, I recommend ""Eye of the Needle."" ""The Cloud"" will most likely leave you just a tad dissapointed."
5,"Clear the floor, cause you'll want to dance...","BUDDY MACMASTER plays a great set of dance tunes in Cape Breton style. Your feet won't want to stay still as his bouncy, lively, fiddlin' style puts magic in your step.If you like Cape Breton fiddlin', you'll LOVE this album. A LOT OF FUN!"
2,Hay Fever,I was not aware that this was a live stage play. It was hard to follow on the audio tape. This was not really a 'story' being told. You really had to visualize who the characters were and what they were doing. This is not good for an audio book content.I am an avid audio book listener.
3,"Not Peter, but fun....","I have looked long and hard for these videos, and finally here's Peter and the family- but be forwarned. If you, like most Sayers fans, know exactly what Peter looks, talks and acts like- if you know how Denver sounds and expect Sir Impey Biggs to be tall and spare and dignified- you'll have an adjustment to make. Still, I've enjoyed the series for two reasons- I can never really dislike Peter Wimsey in any form, and this is my chance to introduce the last remaining non-fan in the household to the Wimsey world. Carmichael is charming if too ""blocky"" and old to really play Peter, but the essence of the story and characters is captured well. Watching it with my faithful sheltie Wimsey at my feet made for a few pleasant evenings. My advice, read the books again but then enjoy the faintly familiar feeling you get from the pleasure of watching the story."
5,Ian Carmichael can't hold a candle to Edward Petherbridge,"Carmichael's Wimsey is great. Sir Edward Petherbridge as Wimsey is genious. Having seen his Wimsey on Mobil Theatre on PBS, I've tried for years to buy a set. To no avail. Let's have all the Wimsey there is!"
2,Disappointed,"I did not see the original broadcast of the Lord Peter Wimsey series in the 70's. I did see and very much enjoyed the 80's episodes with Edward Petherbridge and Harriet Walter. When I purchased Clouds of Witness I expected a better production with a Lord Peter who at least approximated the character in the Sayers's mysteries. The Lord Peter in Clouds is a buffon, uncultured, clumsy and completely unlike the immaculately dressed clothes horse of the books. Bunter would have given up and taken up photography for a living. Also, five cassettes. What a waste. Takes up way too much space for the caliber of the videos. Last, the tapes themselves are of poor quality. Wait for the 80's series."
1,one of the worst!,Don't confuse this movie with one of the same name starring Jason Statham. This one is amateur's night and not worth the time to watch.
3,some good cuts,"This album starts off with a bang with the sprited, lyrical ""Caravan"" by Ellington, the bass carrying the melody and the piano comping. There are other lyrical cuts, the Bossa Nova ""Pensativa"", ""Butterfly"", ""Witch Hunt"" and the romantic ""A Love Affair"" are compelling. All presumable are played on the same bass he used in his classic bass essential album ""Wood"". Virtuoso playing, - melody, and rhythm at the same time.But many of the other tracks, the other 2/3rds, left me scratching my head wondering why, of all the available Pop songs, he chose these? ""Carry on my Wayward Son""?, ""Shining Star""? ""Four Brothers"" with someone whistling the Stan Getz melody through their teeth?? Others left me cold, not like his triumphal ""Wood"" album where every cut, new or old, including the ""Star Spangled Banner"", is astounding.The recording quality, while probably fine, is clearly not up to the audiophile standards of ""Wood"" either.""Wood"" (1) I highly recommend. I was expecting more of the same ..."
4,Review of Benjamin Ray's African Religions,"In this text Ray discusses the myths and ritual beliefs behind various native African religions. He does so respectfully and in enough depth to explain and provide background for those who are uneducated in this particular area. If you are looking for a great reference for papers or a religion class, this is it."
2,Rather dry and poorly edited,"So-so textbook surveying the range of African religions largely in terms of significant common themes (art, religious authorities, divinities, etc.). The thematic structure shifts in the final two chapters to a consideration of African Islam and African Christianity. Note that these chapter titles specify the contents correctly, as Ray focuses on indigenized, and in some cases syncretistic or ""heterodox,"" Muslim and Christian traditions, not on Islam in Africa or Christianity in Africa as such. Indeed, it would have enriched the book to have included some coverage of more ""orthodox"" expressions of Islam and Christianity in Africa. The book is occasionally illuminating, but shabbily written and/or edited, especially in the later chapters (""He trys [sic] to make the people understand,"" p. 160, as an example)."
4,A Real Diva,"It's hard to find a song first recorded by Barbra and consider it good. Dana did it well! She is a great artist. I wish I could find all her CDs easily in Brazil. If you happen to find them and enjoy listening to dance music, buy ALL of them She's unique!"
4,Location ideal for Vikings,Fascinating read! He has some really grand artifact findings and some great arguments especially with the demographics.Quite the story to be told and to watch unfold. Let's see if the government will cough up a dig to find the truth of the site!!
5,Makes more sense than the Viking site at L'Anse aux Meadows,"I enjoyed the book so much that I had to read it a second time. I think the theory put forward in this book makes more sense than the Viking site at L'Anse aux Meadows, with all it's shoals and breakers and not even an harbour and no trees for miles. The Vikings were very inteligent people and were great navigators. Common sense tells us that they continued to a more favorable place. Mr Budden,in Vinland Discovery-the unfinished story, tells us where.Frank Slade,Korean war veteranSt. Anthony, Newfoundland."
4,"Aaron Hall's ""The Truth"" WILL SET YOU FREE","Coming off the success of New Jack Swing Supergroup, GUY, Aaron Hall comes with ""The Truth"", his debut solo album. Truly one of the best voices in R&B music, Aaron presents a wonderful work of sophisticated ballads and rough uptempo tracks.Considered ""The Nastyman"",he lets loose this reputation with ""Get A Little Freaky With Me"" and ""Open Up"". He also brings back a ajazz you up version of his #1 R&B song from the JUICE motion picture soundtrack, ""Don't Be Afraid"". Until I Found You"" serves as a mellow transition from his nasty side, where he expresses to the love of his life. Once ""The Nastyman"" persona leaves, ""The Voice"" comes to rouse spiritual awakening. ""Don't Be Afraid"" (Sex you down some mo mix) stirs the soul, and ""Let's Make Love"" is self explanatory.""When You Need Me"", ""I Miss You"",and ""Until the End of Time"" are strong ballads that just saturate your mind with love. Indeed, Aaron Hall can do no wrong, with The Truth on his side.Ronaldo Davis"
3,Oldie but goodie,"I bought this CD specifically for the a couple slow songs that I absolutely love on this CD. The reason why I gave 3 stars instead of 5 is because I used to own this on cassette back in the day, and I guess I used to only listen to the side with slow jams on it, because when I got the CD I did not recognize the first several songs on this cd, and I also didn't necessarily care for any of them. Nevertheless, the slow songs that I do like on this CD (and I mean, I like them ALOT) makes the purchase worth it."
5,Vocally this is who R.Kelly wishes he could be,"Aaron Hall led Guy there first two albums with his Charlie Wislon esque vocals. Aaron was in top on the ballads Let's Chill, Goodbye Love, Piece Of My Love and Yearning For Your Love. Much to the dismay of myself and many fans, Mr.Hall was overshadowed by R.Kelly. Any avid music listener nows if you listen to his Born Into the 90's albums he sounds just like Aaron. Aaron is in top form on the ballads Let's Make Love, When You Need Me, Don't Be Afraid (Sex You Down Version) and the huge single I Miss You. For good quality R&B,check this album out."
2,"Worth a Look for ""Porky's Duck Hunt""","An improvement over the inessential Bugs Bunny collection, Warner Home Video's two-disc set includes Daffy Duck's memorable film debut: ""Porky's Duck Hunt"" (1937). The beautifully restored Tex Avery gem makes a belated DVD premiere. Otherwise, it's the same Warner fast-buck syndrome."
4,"Short, Sappy, and Missing Something",This video is long on sappy and short on time. Pooh and his friends struggle to let Christopher Robin grow up when they discover he is writing a valentine to a GIRL! Will Christopher Robin still love Pooh and his friends? You'll have the answer in about 15 minutes.
4,Decide for Yourselves,"Forgive me for speaking on my own behalf, but anyone reading the next-in-line review might think my book was trash. It is not, of course. Before it was published it was reviewed by Professor Juliet McMaster, of the University of Alberta, a leading member of the Jane Austen Society of North America and one of their most delightful speakers. It was Professor McMaster who wrote: Jane would be proud of you (I intend of have those words engraved on my tombstone.)The next reviewer claims to be a member of the Jane Austen Society, but she chooses to be anonymous. No true Jane Austen reader would hide her identity.Elizabeth Newark"
3,Kind of misleading in the title,"If you picked up this book wanting to learn all about Charlotte Lucas, you'll be disappointed.I would have thought it brilliant to find out just how on earth the poor girl endured Mr. Collins, day in, day out, but she wasn't the only focus of the book, and, judging by the title, she should have been.And I found the author's comment below really petty. We ARE deciding for ourselves, you know? No true San Franciscan would be so uptight about someone else's opinion."
1,This book is absolutely awful.,"I am also, like the author, a JASNA member. I looked forward to the book, particularly as the presumable topic was Charlotte. The author's verbage is more an exercise in her wish to string together names of ""offspring"" of all the characters in all the Jane Austen novels ever written, without regard to time, location, and most certainly, without regard to probability. This book did not concern Charlotte; stole too much language from Jane's novels, and did not resemble Austen's works in style, story or sense. A waste of my money."
2,Very Disappointed,"I waited a long time to get my hands on this book, as the inter libery did not hold a copy. ... I was very disappointed in the story it started out well but I found that it lacked something. The story is mainly about Charlotte Collins and her daughter whom the youngest of the Darcy's son's falls in love with. To me it needed more bite to the story, as it was too short and I felt that more could have been added which would have made the story much more interesting"
3,LabLover,"I actually bought this bag to carry (& wheel) much of my dog training accessories. Going to and from classes, matches and shows was nearly like ""moving"". Lots of stuff to carry.This bag is a great size for insuring you take the necessary items ( not everything - you need a room for what you gather for dog training).To me, the biggest drawback is the inflexible inside slots...too stiff...and no interior pockets...it would have been perfect...just what I need to make portablilty easier, if there was some flexible interior storage. I still like it...but wish it had a little more useful inside slots."
2,Bad Design,"I bought this bag for my husband. He works construction and needs to take his tools and safety harness to and from work everyday. He also rides the NYC subways and a commuter train, so we thought this bag would be great and make his life much easier. That it did but only for a short time because the wheels broke after a couple of months of use. He's going to try and fix them himself but I am trying to find another bag with sturdier wheels.Stanley, can't you fix this? He really likes this bag and a lot of people ask him about it and commend the idea. Unfortunately, he has to tell them that the wheels are terrible! Seems like a lot of people complain about this particular feature."
2,disappointed,"My husband was very excited when he received his Stanley storage bag. It had plenty of room for his tools that he travels with. However, on his very first trip to an install job, a piece of the plastic on the bottom broke off. Now the bag falls to the side every time he sits it down. We are not very pleased at all. Time to look for another bag."
3,Love the bag and the concept hate the small wheels.,I work construction and I have to carry a lot of tools around. This holds everything I need with ease. It has enough pockets and even a gigantic one in front that is big enough to hold my charger. the problem is the wheels are tiny. around 2 inches. if anybody has worked a construction site it has a lot of cords on the floor and debris. The wheels catch on every little thing. It gets frustrating trying to roll this thing around. you have to lift it all of the time to get around little things on the floor. another thing is that the handle could be less flimsy and lock when you pull it up. I want to keep the bag but the only way I could is if it had bigger wheels that don't get stuck on small debris all the time.
2,Poorly thought out pockets,"The tool pockets are both too tight and too short. It would probably be OK, If all your tools are short things like screwdrivers and pliers, but longer items tend to flop around unsupported, creating a disorganized jumble ."
4,Good tool bag,"This tool bag is convenient, roomy and the roll aroung wheels makes life a lot easier. I just completed a recent work assignment and it came in handy. The only thing that I found is that the legs are not that strong. The airline managed to break one of the legs on my return from the job. Other than that I strongly recommend it for carrying tools up to about 50 lbs."
5,Great bag with lots of room for all tools!!,I have been looking some time for a good quality bag to use in my computer service business and this fits the bill! Plenty of pockets inside and outside to stick various tools along with a big open area in the middle. As some have said the only down side is that when the bag is loaded down the handle has a tendency to collapse unless your very careful but it is something than can be worked around. Other than that even with over 50lbs of tools it has performed flawlessly so far.
2,Great Bag,I found the bag in Target for alot less ($35.00)then Amazon is selling it and guess what NO shipping and No waiting! This is a great bag for heavy tools. My husband loves it.
3,Read carefully,"I ordered this from a person's wish list without looking at the description carefully. This is a kiddie chair or small adult (150 lb max). It says ""jr"" in the title but that refers to the chair size not that Jimmie is the son of Jimmie Sr. Nobody else noticed until it was opened on Xmas morn."
4,Delightful,A delightful look at Olie and his family - good stories for my almost 4 year old and interesting colors/actions for my toddler. Only problem is its too short (24 mins)!
5,Another great Olie video!,Bright and colorful computer animated tales of a young boy and his family and friends....and Pollie Pie!! She is so adorable....my son giggles when she comes on the screen!
5,Nut 47445R Steel Poly 50 Pack,These are original Marson nuts. I purchased them to restock my kit. They are exactly what I wanted and what was advertised. Good price. Timely shipping. I would purchase again.
3,Coffee Table collectibles!,"Hardly the last word on the topic, I would consider it to be A BOOK on the topic, and not THE BOOK. There is quite a bit more that can be written on the topic.It is illustrated, but almost a boilerplate format in lockstep with other similiar books. I bought this online, and if I had the opportunity to preview it before purchasing, I probably would have walked away."
5,Teen Titans for GBA,"I purchased this as a birthday gift and the birthday loved it. He plays it all the time. It was ""user friendly"" enough that my 6 year old was able to decipher how to play just by interacting with the game."
1,great entertainment,Myself and my kids enjoyed this game. I felt like I was a teen titans. Not to hard and not to easy. Good game play.
3,Decent organizer,I was putting this in an older model celica and it's actually pretty small. I couldn't get it comfortably placed either. The straps isn't quite long enough to wrap around my seat so I had to improvise with the headrest. I don't think it's that great of a buy because the pockets aren't that large or deep. The bottom pocket with the zipper is the most useful but if you have an armrest then it's not as accessible as your armrest.I wouldn't recommend this buy unless you're desperate for some organizational space. Especially for older vehicles that aren't built with many pockets.
3,Hercule Poirot and a restless mouse save the day,"Having not yet read or listened to (I'm a big audiobook fan) Agatha Christie's original ""Hickory Dickory Dock"", I can't speak to the quality of the adaptation here. But looked at simply as a TV-movie ""whodunit"", I enjoyed this production. Acting, directing, pacing, and music all rate solid marks, keeping things moving along and preventing an understated story (this is no ""Murder on the Orient Express"") from becoming dull and routine. You sure to see a lot of that mouse, though. I guess if you have a trained mouse that can act on cue you have to make the most of him. A clean DVD image and a handful of modest extras round out this pleasant little DVD."
5,starring.. the mouse,"This is my favorite Poirot mystery. The dvd transfer is excellent as well. The initial Poirot releases on dvd had terrible transfers and looked as if they were being projected on a gym class wall, but Acorn seems to have gotten it right this time with quality audio and video. Follow the mouse as he seems to pop up everywhere and finally takes a starring role in this amusingly different Poirot adventure. Enjoy!"
4,Smushes things better than a wrestler with a rolling pin,"This works fairly well for making sure that the Dynamat is securely pressed against the surface, with no little air gaps that reduce its effectiveness. The rubber roller creates enough friction with the surface to stretch it into place, which is essential for working out the little gaps and air bubbles that reduce the effectiveness of the Dynamet.The handle is plain wood, and I think a soft rubber grip would be better. It isn't very comfortable to hold.I think it is a bit overpriced, but much more usable than the economy version. If you are trying to decide between the two, get this one. The cheaper version just doesn't work well and you'll probably end up coming back to buy the better one (as I did)."
1,wow,"this is a wallpaper seam roller. i bought a plastic one at lowes for 2 bucks. u can get a rubber one for 6 bucks at a hardware store. im sure this roller does work, but 13 bucks is crazy. i beat the heck out of my 2 dollar one and its still going."
1,Poor quality,Product came apart during the first hour of use. I was able to finish the installation of the mat with much difficulty due to the broken product.
4,Dynamat Roller,"What can I say its a roller, but it came in really handy when installing the Dynamat. Don't forget you can use the handle end to form the mat into crevisis and such. Did the whole interior in my Bronco II and the roller dod not fail. Came in really handy inside the doors and roof flat areas. Glad I purchased it. Gave it only 4 stars because it is a little cheep in quallity. This does not look like it would hold up if used daily."
1,Waste of Money,You can get this equivalent product at Home Depot or Lowe's for something like 5 bucks last time I checked. Throwing money out the window if you buy this.
4,Overkill for most,"This was a nice roller, but if you are only going to be doing your doors or a small portion of your vehicle this is probably overkill. I have no real complaints about the roller, but for $15 it felt a little cheap. Given that it is a certain one time use item next time I would probably try to find an alternative."
3,Dynamat Roller,Good product but I used my fingers more to get into detail spaces. The roller was only handy on large open areas.
3,Does the job,Not much to say here. The product works but quality could be better IMO. The handle feels a little cheap to me.
3,Has its uses,"This tool does make it easier like they say it does, BUT that was more so for the trunk application and floors. WHen doing your doors because of all the little sunken in areas the smaller roller comes in pretty handy."
4,rollin rollin great,Use this for everything including laying flooring. Makes jobs must more simple and the quality is great. Very hand friendly
3,Worked well for most of the project,"Maybe I press too hard, but this thing started to bend and not roll well after a box of Dynamat. Disappointed in it for the $$$"
1,useless accessories,I used dynamat for doors and trunk deadening. And the roller been absolutely useless for that. Especially inside of doors. You can achieve better pressure just by using a back side of scissors or paper knife.
2,Poor Quality,"Poor quality, fell apart quickly. I did read this prior to purchaing, but you can't always believe a few reviews, I was wrong, believe them."
5,works great,"Well made roller. Installed Dynamat all over my truck, and this thing worked very well. It would be nice if the edges of the roller had a radius for getting into tight spots but turning it around and using the handle as a tool works well also."
4,"It works well, but the squeak it bad.","I was torn between 3 or 4 stars but I'm an optimist so gave it 4. I installed 3 bulk packs of dynamat extreme and many many yards of ensolite in my 2009 Honda Accord V6 to tame down the road noise and to cut down on some reflections that bugged me. I used this tool quite a bit but found myself using the wooden end almost as must as the roller end. It would be nice if it was ball bearing as someone trying to quiet their car, listening to this thing squeak almost drove me insane. I used the roller quite a bit when installing the ensolite barrier though.I was an MECP Master installer in a previous life. I also competed SQ for many years and dB for a year or two.Good tool but I wish that they would make a ball bearing version."
2,So so book.,"I was looking for a piece of gold, but most of the stuff presented here I knew. It was a okay read and no book is ever wasted."
5,Masterpiece,"There's something very appealing about the situation the characters of Star Trek: Voyager are in. These people have been thrust halfway across the galaxy and probably won't ever see their families or loved ones again. But they are desperatley trying to get back and we feel for them. Anyone who's ever lost someone close to them or has gone through a tough experience can probably identify with the struggles which are most evident in ""Eye of the Needle."" The crew are on an emotional roller-coaster ride from start to finish when Ensign Kim detects a wormhole that allows communication with the Alpha Quandrant. We see how this discovery affects every character, everyone from Janeway to Kes. The performances are right on the money, and so is the writing. The story throws in twists where we expect predictability and keeps things highly entertaining. The subplot involving the Doctor is also well done. All in all, this one of the best episodes of Voyager. It deserves a place in your home!"
3,Not Quite,"The songs are all nice, but that's it. Nice. Kind of like the Partridge Family. No surprises. Basic harmonies. Check out Jason Falkner or Matthew Sweet for something with more substance(chord and structure)."
3,Harris Sounds Great ... but ...,"I bought this for MacArthur Park which I happen to like (some people don't). As I recall that song was one of the first to run that long (around 7 1/2 minutes) and still be played on the radio. The other songs are enjoyable enough and Harris has a great deep voice. So what's not to like? First of all, few of the songs are that interesting; it's a bit boring. Secondly the whole album plays for only about 32 minutes with only 9 songs. Albums used to have a dozen songs; then many of them cut to a standard 10; this only gives you 9. If they were 9 wonderful songs, I wouldn't complain, but other than showcasing a really good singer, there is just nothing that interesting here. Sound quality is good. 4 stars for Harris himself and the quality; 3 for a very short album with nothing much that interesting on it."
4,A Fine Recording for the Nostalgic,"Once upon a time, before Rock and Roll took over the world, there was a splendid, almost rocking hit called McArthur Park, written by Jimmy Webb and sung by Richard Harris - a superb writer and performer collaboration. The album wasn't named for the song, considered too long for radio play, but the radio played it anyway. The other songs on the album, including the sweet and light ""Paper Chase"" and the tragi-clownish ""A Tramp Shining,"" haven't achieved the same fame, but make for light lounge fare at its best. If you're looking for the version to have of McArthur Park and some pleasant listening on the way, this is a splendid purchase. The only drawback is that this is an old recording and the sound doesn't always come through as loud and clear as it might."
1,terrible,It is not an original of the actual record that I have. I wanted the cds but this is not it.
4,Period Piece,I personally am a jazz/R&B fan but I must say this captures a feeling of the era and I am very impressed with Richard Harris and what he does with his limited vocal capabilities. The arrangements are somewhat overdone but effective and the mood created really works.
3,One famous song,"This of course is the original album that had ""MacArthur Park"" on it -- yes, the one that for some reason people love to hate, although there are some (like me) that actually enjoy the song (at least in small quantities -- nostalga no doubt). So the words don't make much sense -- who cares? It's a cute song. The rest of the album isn't bad for 1960's, but it doesn't necessarily grow on you. But who knows, you may like it."
1,"IF I COULD I""D GIVE THIS A NEGATIVE TEN STARS!!!!","Ok, there's something I don't understand, why there are people who give this 5 starts. Anyone who likes this song must have a SEVERE mental problem. The song ""McArthur Park"" is the all time worst song ever! He's just being over dramatic, not singing. In McArthur Park there are such lyrics as ""Someone left the cake out in the rain, and i don't know if i can take it cause it took so long to bake it, and i'll never have that recipe again! OHHHHHHHH NOOOOOOOO!!!!"" Come on people, my uncle Harry could write better song than that, and he's dead! ZERO STARS!!!!!"
5,"Rich, Smooth, Delicious!","I discovered these chocolates in a wine tasting room, and fell in love, love, love. Not only are they perfect to be paired with red wines, they are wonderful for any ""chocoholic attack"". These little babies are to be savored, never chewed, as they melt decadently and finish beautifully. You can taste them long after they are gone, so it only takes a couple for the perfect chocolate fix. I highly recommend them for anyone who loves good chocolate."
1,Don't Bother,"I received this as a gift - when I opened the chocolate to enjoy it - I found all the pieces melted together and they were so old they turned white. I called the company to let them know and was told that the white is called ""bloom"" and basically with temperature changes it causes the fat to rise to the top. The girl was so busy telling me there was nothing she was going to do for me - she missed the point that I was trying to improve their quality control so, I could by a better product in the future. She told me she didn't care if I bought it again - that ""chocolate is alive and this can happen"". So, if you want a quality product - buy local. I think this company has a bigger problem with their business model as far as customer service is concerned. I did taste the chocolate - inedible is how I would describe it."
4,Book is small - Pictures are small,"This book is beautiful, but it is a small book (I guess I was thinking it would be a coffee table book... my own stupid fault). The pictures are tiny as well; some of them merely an 1 1/2 by 1 1/2.... I actually used a magnifying glass with it. It was worth it, because the fairy houses are great... it's just LITTLE! I'm just surprised they used such a teeny format for a book of pictures!"
4,Fairy Houses ... Everywhere,"pictures are ""great"" I bought this for my six years G Grand daughter , maybe she try her hands at building some Fairy houses;"
4,Faries,Like this book for a gift. Our daughter-in-law wanted this for Christmas. She has just got into faries and mini gardens
2,poor design,"I found this book to be inspiring when it came to the beautiful fairy houses depicted, but I have to agree with another reviewer, in that the photo quality is quite poor. The photo quality really takes away from the book and the book design is unappealing. There are annoying feathered borders on photos on graded colour backgrounds which is really distracting to the eye. It looks like the photographer used a macro lens with improper settings or without a tripod, either way most closeup photos are out of focus likely from using a shutter speed too low. I recommend a new edition with a different layout and better photography....then it would be spectacular. Overall, I was disappointed and hope they put out a better edition....this book could be a real gem."
2,"Nice idea, but too small","The idea behind the book, photographs of adorable houses built for fairies out of natural materials, is wonderful, but I found that the pictures were too small for my daughter to get too excited about. In future editions, I hope the authors/publisher will consider enlarging the photos and adding more text."
2,So so,"I have to admit, I'm a bit over the pebbles and berries effort to make a faery home, if it's very primitive. Go on fairy houses dot com. If you like what you see then you'll enjoy this book. Fairy Island is a much nicer choice for a book in this type of genre, if you will. In fact one of my favorite books, is ""In the Realm of the Never Fairies: The Secret World of Pixie Hollow"" by Disney, unbelievably, it's very eye catching. Check out my book list for tons of ideas. Wendy Froud's books are EXCELLENT too!"
5,Inspiring,"This book is full of inspiration! Also love that it shows different kinds of houses and has already provided inspiration! I can see the stages already - scavenger for building materials, design and build your own fairy houses and then hide 'em in the garden to create a little magic world right outside your door! Just lovely!"
5,Fairy Houses,I love this book!!! I have given it to many friends for presents. It is so much fun to create your own fairy houses. Inspiring!!!
5,ST Voyager,"I am a Star Trek Trekkie. I have every video that was made for Star Trek. Needless to say I rate every one 4.5 / 5 , and have every one on DVD and VHS!! They take up the whole wall in my dining room. The DVD's are backup for all the videotapes, and now I have the last ones I didn't have on VHS.I wish I could get the ""Star Trek New Voyages (2004)"" videos, and the ""Star Trek New Voyages Phase II (2004)"" videos.Dave"
4,Nosyrev Violic & Cello Concertos,A good listen. I am a fan of Russian composers of this era.Under the circumstances of the times they produced great music.
3,No whistle,"Wouldn't recommend, kettle looks great, but whistle doesn't work, so a bit useless. Have kept it but will buy a different kettle when I find one I like better."
2,jazzy,"This C.D. is really jazz funk club like. Definitely a good c.d. for night club lounge, tea cocktails. Not so much for coffee/tea shop or general listening."
3,Playing the Lottery,I needed two bulbs of this type for my new range hood. I ordered 3 so I would have a spare on hand. Upon receiving the bulbs I put two in the hood. One did not turn on. I put in the extra and fortunately it worked. They work well and give off lots of light so we will usually use only the first two of the three brightness settings. I hope that this will increase the life span somewhat. I am a bit worried that they will not last well.I gave this three stars since the bulbs that work provide nice light but I am very concerned about the overall quality.
2,Defective or just a piece of junk?!,"I bought two of these bulbs, because they are the only size that will fit into our apartment ceiling lights. They're quite expensive, so I figured I'd give Amazon a chance with my light bulbs. I don't think I'll be doing that again! I bought two, and one immediately wasn't working. I just figured that it got messed up in shipping and shrugged it off. The other one was working fine... for all of 2 days! It burnt out within 48 hours! I'm not sure what the issue was, but as I already threw away the boxes I couldn't return them... so there goes my light bulb purchasing experience on Amazon. These bulbs are crap and I'd definitely not get them online!"
1,Don't Buy!,Very poor quality. 2 of the 4 bulbs I ordered burnt out in one week so I returned them all.
3,Burned out first couple days,"I assume this is a fluke, but what a bummer. I need to go to the store so that I can see when I'm cooking. :(The other one is working fine. So, I'm giving these the average of the two stars (1 star, 5 star)."
2,Nothing great,"This bulb was rated for only so many hours, and after a cold night, it blew out! I would NOT buy again! 1000bulbs.com has longer lasting bulbs for less money."
3,good spotlight,This was the right bulb for the satco spotlight I bought. It was reasonably priced and received at the same time as the spot light.
2,"Ordered two, only one worked","I ordered two of these bulbs. Out of the box, the first one didn't work (completely dead). The other one does seem to work fine, though it's only been installed for a few minutes so far."
2,Ordered OSRAM - Got Sylvania,"Note that you may be confused when you thought you ordered a product from OSRAM and what you get is one from Sylvania. These two companies merged in 1993, OSRAM being a German company and Sylvania being an American company with a long history of consumer products in the United States. Regardless ... what you get is a light bulb manufactured in China with the Sylvania brand. This is probably true for just about any brand of light bulb you might order.The OSRAM website says these bulbs should last 2500 hours. Based on my personal experience - don't expect that. In fact I think the average is closer to 1000 hours. This is based on the fact that I regularly cycle through the 24 bulbs I have in my house and have gotten a good feel for how reliable various brands are. Worst is Westinghouse, Sylvania is next and upon ordering this round of bulbs I expected to test the OSRAM bulb only to find out that they are in fact Sylvania's also."
4,One in Eight did not work,"I installed 26 recessed cans with these bulbs. Three burned out between 60 seconds and 120 seconds of use. All the others have been working fine for almost two years now. So, if they last more than two minutes you should be golden. They do provide a great ""crisp and white"" light. All mine are installed with dimmer switches. I've noticed that incandescent lights buzz and humm with dimmer switches, but these are dead silent. Perfect (after two minutes)."
4,50 Watt PAR20 Flood bulb,I purchased these bulbs through this site after checking out a number of sights that sold them. The price per bulb ($6.40) was excellant and the bulbs have been in use since late October with no issues to report. I was very happy with the quality and delivery time as well.
4,Excellent Reference,"As a member of an Emergency Medical Service, it is important for us to have quick references, specially with a topic so critical as Hazardous Materials (HazMat). This guide provides a lot of useful information that tells you not only how to protect yourself, but also how to provide a very basic treatment to people affected by one of the 398 chemicals this guide details.Complains: the visual presentation of the information is a little bit uncomfortable, but once you get used to it, you get to the data quickly.The guide gives you tabulated information about the chemical, its common names, how to measure it, respiration protection exposed people should use, medical problems caused by over-exposure and basic treatment.I highly recommend this guide to people that work or can find themselves into situations involving dangerous chemicals."
3,Inspiration,"Take this book as an inspiration. It offers you new appraoches for the search of subjects and the way to cature them on film.The book is relatively poor in instruction and something like ""swirl your camera with an open shutter at its strap but be carefull that the strap is carefully fixed"" can only be taken as an invitation to be more creative. And jumping up and down in a forrest with your camera's shutter open might also not be everybody's idea of innovative photography.You need to like Freeman Patterson's photos in their simplicity to appreciate his explanations. I do, and I like the book as well!"
5,The BEST book to help train your eye to see the shot youwant,"Several years ago, I took a class with my new camera for a national known photographer. I ask for a book or text to help learn to get the shot I knew was there. His first and only suggestion was this book. I went to the library, got the book every time I could for the next year and almost worn it out. The next year some of my coworkers insisted that I enter a statewide juried show with 4 photos in 4 of 12 categories. I took home a 1st,2nd,and 2 honorable mentions. The photos are now in a musuem forever. This I credit to the book and the photographer who would not suggest another book. Good luck and happy seeing to all :)"
3,"Not my favorite book, but it is still a good book.","I thought this book was ok. I personally like Bryan Peterson's Learning to See Creatively better. This book was usefull however, and I did learn from it. It is just not my favorite choice."
3,Interesting but weak coverage of basic principles,"This book is mainly for advanced photographers who have a thorough knowledge of the basics of photographic composition and are looking to explore new areas. It's goal is to get you to extend your techniques beyond the usual and develop your own personal style. The basics of composition are addressed only in a cursory fashion.For a beginning to intermediate photographer like myself, it would help to have a solid grasp of composition before departing from it. If this is your situation, then you would be better served by ""Photograhic Composition"" by Grill and Scanlon (which is currently in print) or better yet ""Image:Designing Effective Pictures"" by Michael Freeman. The latter book is by far the best discussion of composition that I've read. Unfortunately, it's no longer in print, so you'll have to find a used copy."
4,Inspiring Photos,More of a book of photos than a how-to workshop book. The photos are inspiring nonetheless which proves the author's point on seeing how great photos can train you to see like a photographer. I would check this out of a library and get a subscription to National Geographic instead.
4,Raising baby,"This episode deals with the issue of parenthood...and what that really means. There are two storylines going on here - one involving the birth of the baby Kira has been carrying for the O'Briens, and the other involving Odo and his old nemisis, Dr. Mora.As Kira gives birth, Chief O'Brien and Shakaar spar over their respective roles in the big event. At the same time, Quark lets Odo in on his most recent acquisition - a baby changling.As Kira's labor continues, Odo, Dr. Bashir and Dr. Mora (the Bajoran who ""discovered"" Odo's true nature) work with the sickly changling, trying to bring it back to health and to get it to grow.In the end, both Kira and Odo experience a sense of loss...but were the experiences they had worth the pain they now feel?I really enjoyed this episode - espeically the storyline involving Odo, Mora, and the baby changling. I give this episode 4 stars and call it a ""must see"" for Odo fans!"
1,Buy some surgical tubing!,"Let me begin by saying that I'm not the sort of person who blasts products for minor defects, or who hands out 1-star reviews lightly. In fact, this is my first. That being said, this is the chintziest piece of junk I have bought in modern memory. There's nothing redeeming about it--nothing. The brackets aren't strong enough to not bend under the tension of the band (not even workout tension...just hanging the thing on your door causes them to bend). The ""tension adjuster"" isn't strong enough to stay in place. Once tightened and reinforced, the brackets aren't strong enough to stay stationary. I'm stunned that a product this shoddy is for sale in 2009. Oh, and lastly: look closely at the pictures on the box; they imply that you can use it for both upper- and lower-body workouts. Look again at the brackets, though--you'd need to take the thing down and reassemble it every time you wanted to switch."
1,Includes all necessary hardware?,"This mounting kit will be perfect for you... as long as you have a stud exactly in the right place. Unlike most kits that include a cross bar to affix to studs on either side of the desired mount location, this kit has two holes in the plate. You can thus mount it directly to a stud, and nowhere else. So if you're trying to center it in a precise spot, you better get lucky with the stud finder. (Or have a masonry wall)"
5,Very well made,"Even though this NIKON remote cord costs more than double what a generic cord costs, it is well worth the difference. It is well made, sturdy, will not give me problems with the electrical connections, and I am confident that the hot shoe connection will not suddenly come apart- at the worst possible moment."
5,High quality construction,"If you need a remote cord pay a few extra dollars and buy the real-deal Nikon SC-28.The cord is very sturdy, the attachment lock is very easy to operate and all the advanced features of new Nikon flashes work correctly and work all the time."
5,Great product!,"This product might be a bit more expensive than some other options, but it is durable and is guaranteed to get the job done. So far I haven't had any problems. It works great and gets the job done allowing for a wide range of options when using a flash."
3,get going already,This book is an adventurous exploration of career change. It works well for mid-career persons who have time to jump around. i agree there can be too much analysis and not enough action. Check this book.
2,Not very much to the book...,"There is honestly not a lot to this book.The fundamental contribution made is ""Do stuff, and see how you feel about it -- don't think about everything you could do, and plot out a detailed plan, before even considering switching. You can make mistakes.""As opposed to the ""Well, spent a lot of time thinking about what you'd like to do. Figure it out yet? No? Well then go back and think some more."" approach that is supposedly all so common today.This, interspersed with a lot of stories of people who are in their late 30s and 40s switching from jobs whose titles all sound fairly irrelevant to me (me being a 24 year old ex-software engineer searching for something more interesting to do with my life). I guess having worked 3 years in the same sort of job (plus a 4 year degree that says 'go write code'), I'm not nearly as invested as the people who have been doing what they've done for 20 years..."
2,Advice for the wealthy.,"The most frequent advice the author seems to give, is ""Take a sabbatical"". Iberra ofers little advice for the person who is ready for change, but simply can't afford to make it. If you make less than six figures a year, you'll find yourself asking ""Uh... what am I going to eat while I do that?"".Beyind this, though, the book does deal with how to emotionally navigate the hurdles of being ""between two worlds"" while changing careers, so it's not a total loss.Myself, I find that I fell into a career track that I never wanted, and know I want out. I need the financial and navigational help to move back towards where I wanted to be originally, or find something new. This book doesn't provide that, as much as the emotional support needed to convince yourself you really have chosen the wrong path.If you're wealthy, this book will work for you. If not, you may want to look for another one, as this one has some items of use for you, but you'll have to work to find them."
4,Appropriate for Exec-Level Career Changers (or Contemplators...),"Most books on career reinvention are geared towards mid-level, mid-life managers. The assumption is that executives are already successful and don't need to reflect on what makes them shine. But for continued success in life, we all need to discover what truly drives us. Working Identity is ideal for the exec who wants to stretch beyond their current career, credentials and contact network."
4,"Good Stories, Simplistic Advice","The stories chosen to illustrate the points in this book are verstatile and uplifting. However the main point is rather banal and boils down to this: ""most of us don't know what we want to do, and we can only figure it out by experimenting"". It will share such insights as ""taking time for reflection"" and to ""creating small wins"" and so on. Most of them will not strike you as very novel but the stories illustrate them well."
2,Look for a better book,"Indeed, there were one or two ideas which I took abroad (repeated throughout the book), but nothing more. For me, the examples-people chosen to describe different paths to new careers were too far from where I am (by the way, did any of them had children?). I agree with some comments here that this book doesn't provide any practical navigational help for those who do have little money to bridge the move, and/or have children to take care of; or the emotional support needed to convince yourself you really have chosen the wrong path. One could say that this is perhaps mission impossible as not everybody can afford a radical career change, but then if you are not a relatively wealthy, single or a childless couple to afford this at the first place, the book is not really worth of your time."
2,Two point five stars,"There are a lot of good ideas and theories in this book, but I regret buying it. I've lost my job due to industry changes and belt tightening and money is in short supply. I don't find that this book has helped me figure out how to retool to stay employed. I'm not using the book and I can't afford to buy things that I don't absolutely need. Not recommended if you are not of the wealthy class and need to keep the wolf from the door. Annoying to hear how the upper class has time and energy to dabble. Lots of ""I made so much money as a corporate lawyer/park avenue doctor that now I can afford to teach haiku at the local zen monastary."""

4,Creepy...,"Michael Sturdevant is quiet and doesn't have many friends. Josh Jennings is the most popular kid in school. But yet, they're friends. Enter the decidedly strange Sturdevant family... Especially Michael's creepy little sister, Gladys. Among other weird things, this family really enjoys dinner, maybe too much. But, when Josh's class teacher vanishes after a supper invitation from the Sturdevants, he gets the unappetizing feeling she was the main course. Now, would Josh be on the menu for THE MOST GHOULISH MEAL OF THE DAY?"
2,OUCH!!,"Very light and decent sound, but...OWWWW! These things hurt my ears! Your ear has to be just the right size for these headphones otherwise they dig into your skull. I bought these to listen to music at my desk at work and I get headaches from the pain on my ears after about 30 minutes."
3,Misty Mundae Is In It!!,I wish I could give it 6 stars because Misty Mundae is in almost every scene!
5,Absolutely GREAT bag!,"This bag is excellent...lighter colored pockets make it much easier to find things that are tucked away. Everything about the bag is very functional...great zippers, great wheels, great handle...only one minor complaint...the zipper tabs don't have the little rings that let you put a small lock on to secure...but the ends of the tabs have large enough holes to make do...other than that one very minor thing...I LOVE THIS BAG!!!!!!"
5,Two Hearts,"This debut album from the former jayhawks singer/songwriter simply astounds in it's beauty, like hearing the sound of wind in fields of grass. When my beloved grandmother died this was the first album i put on to comfort me. A Folk Masterpiece that i'll be listening forever."
2,Not useful,"Low stars because VIP is a company that is no longer in business. This is the manual they sold as part of their vinyl repair system. Therefore, it references products that are no longer available (I have looked). There is a product by SEM and several other companies. and their are instructions on the web as well as the SEM website. The business information is nothing unique but the repair info is sound but not worth buying the whole book for. Personally, I use products from VinylPro."
5,Cute quirky songs!,"I always loved this album. I purchased this to replace an old lp I had. My daughter (21 yrs old) even loves this release. She had already heard ""The Pina Colada Song"" and ""Escape"" on the radio. When she got to hear the rest of the songs she thought the cuts were funny and quite catchy."
5,Hilarious!,"This album is awesome. When I bought the record I only knew the Pina Colada Song, but I had no idea the rest of it would be equally as funny. For those who are unfamiliar with Rupert, I like to think he's a cross between Barry Manilow & Weird Al."
4,Rupert Holmes is a brilliant lyricist,"I don't know what made me buy the tape all those years ago but it hooked me on Rupert Holmes. ""The People You Never get to Love"" is the single most awe inspiring lyrics I've ever heard. If you ever find ""Full Circle"" get it. It will not disappoint."
5,An Excellent Volume of Urban Fantasy,"So often I have been disappointed by urban fantasy. Its great promise has always been done injustice by such books as _The Borribles_ and other pulp trash. But not so with DeLint's work. Dreams Underfoot is a wondrous collection of stories - some funny, some scary, and some sad - that weaves traditional folklore into the tapestry of our modern lives. Books like these are few and far between. DeLint writes as though he has elves living down the block from him, and after reading this book, you'll think you do, too"
3,Simplistic Writing and Errors,This book seemed to me to be written simplistically and had a lot of errors in it. The errors took away any enjoyment I would have got out of reading it. It looked to me like it wasn't even proofread at all before publishing.
4,Walking in dreams...,"I'm not usually a fan of short story collections. That said, Charles De Lint (Canada's King of Fantasy, in my book), has put together a collection of his ""Newford,"" stories in ""Dreams Underfoot.""Newford is a city touched by magic. ""Urban Fantasy,"" is a great way to think of it - you've got a typical tough city atmosphere, but magic is there, waiting to be found, if one only believes. Through some reoccurring characters, the stories tie together wonderfully - with an amazing final story that wraps up the collection with great style.Newford is a place where the homeless sometimes walk fairy roads, where music can save a life, and where a sleeping woman can meet the man of her dreams, while she's dreaming. Inherit a wonderful collection of myth and magic of today - go get this book."
4,Great telephone call recorder!,"This device is the best I've found. Easy to setup, works reliably. Highly recommend!Wish list? I wish the company continued development of the software with new features and improvements. Wish they'd document better. I did contact support once though and they wrote me back promptly."
3,"OH, George! WE Hardly Knew Thee...","Before E.R.Before Batman and Robin.Before Roseanne, The Facts of Life there was:Those pesky Killer Tomatoes, and that really bad high school reunion. Yes, Mr. Clooney cut his teeth on the lame sequel to the smash tomato movie. In Horror High he gets killed early on, but maybe he lives and gets sent to the E.R. Who knows! Who cares, just sit right back and enjoy these tales and don't take them too seriously."
1,Not Clooney's proudest moments,The tomato movie is campy fun. The high school move is crappy withno redeeming qualities. George is on screen for about 4 minutes.
5,Much more sturdy than we expected,"Based on the other reviews I wasn't expecting much from this one. I was pleasantly surprised at: the quality, it looks very good in our nursery; how sturdy it is, it feels like I could climb up on it, no wobbles at all; and finally, how easy it was to put together, my wife had it assembled in less time than it took to get it out of the packaging. This is our fourth boy and I definitely prefer a changing table like this one that has open shelves instead of drawers or doors. All of the pieces were there, we didn't bother installing the safety strap that someone else ranted about since we never used one for the first 3 boys, plus the changing pad you put on top has a strap of it's own (which we cut off) -- just keep a hand on the baby at all times and don't leave to go answer the phone or do something else equally stupid..."
4,Just what we needed,"I was looking for something that wasn't too bulky for our nursery/home office and this fit the bill! It's just the right size for a changing table pad on top and enough shelf space for the diapering essentials. The natural finish even matches the glider I bought 10 years ago. Can't beat the price either! Some assembly required, but nothing too onerous."
3,"Good for infants, but weight ratings are way off","We bought this changing table for two reasons: (a) it matched our cribs in both color and style; and (b) it was weight-rated high enough that we planned to use it to change both our infant and our two-year-old. While it's great looking and has been a huge help with storage, we have been completely unable to change the toddler on it. The first time we set him on the changing area, the metal bars holding the top shelf up began to bend with his weight, and at 30 pounds, he was easily ten pounds under what it stated it could hold. Disappointed that we couldn't use it for that - now we have a changing area on the floor of their room AND a changing table - but it looks great and has been a lifesaver for diaper storage and beyond. Highly recommended, but not for children over 20-25 lbs."
4,"Plenty of Songs, Good Sound, but Missing Hits","There are 18 songs, a goodly number, but the selection is questionable.Of the 18 songs, 3 did not chart on the Billboard 100. Of his 26 songs that did chart, just 15 are included here, but three of those 26 did not occur until after the 1993 publishing/copyright date indicated on the CD.Most strange is that his biggest hit ""Stop Draggin' My Heart Around"" (peaked at #3 in 1981) with Stevie Nicks is not included. Other top 40 hits that are not included: ""Change of Heart"" (#21, 1983), ""Needles and Pins"" (#37, 1986), ""Jammin' Me"" (#18, 1987), and ""You Don't Know How It Feels"" (#13, 1994/5)."
4,Very helpful BUT....,"This book was great at explaining the principles behind the math. However-- THERE WERE HUGE MISTAKES!!! The formula for the correlation coefficient for example, had a misplaced parenthetical that changed the formula. As a rookie in this area I was in tears trying to figure out my homework. This was not the only error, but it certainly was the worst!!!Otherwise, the examples make it easy to understand the concepts of statistics, and certainly made it so I was able to ace the course. I just wish it hadn't had so many errors."
1,The Sound Hoof: Horse health from the ground up,As an already natural trimmer this book had no new insights to offer. The pictures were too few and not helpful to show what was being talked about. I think it promoted why a horse should wear shoes more than why they shouldn't.
1,Save Your Money,"I bought this feeling very hopeful that it would help with my indigestion and constipation issues. I even bought two ninety count bottles. This may work for some since I see many postitive reviews. I suggest not diving in as blindly as I did and believing all the hype posted on the review boards. I honestly found no difference in the way I felt when taking these. Don't fall prey to a ""special offer"" before trying it out."
1,sliced,I ordered this book new from Amazon.com but somehow when I opened the package I found the cover was mutilated. I should have just bought it used.
2,Billy Joel,"This book gives you an easy way to play his songs. If you want to play just the simple tunes to the songs then get this book. For those who want the actual transcriptions that you hear on his cds, go for the billy joel keyboard book."
3,Not great,"Billy's music is so complex, this book is usless, unless you are looking just to know the chords or melody of the song. If you wanna be able to actually play the real songs, go for the Authentic Transcription book."
5,A Keeper for Log Cabin fans,"This book was part of a teaching moment at my local quilt guild. I am glad I found it from a private seller. The directions are clearly written, and I can't wait to make a log cabin spiral quilt!"
3,Not so great Kyle Baker.,"The Cowboy Wally Show was a departure from what I've read from Mr. Baker. Very dry and tounge in cheek humour, which I am usually a fan of, didn't really get me here. The art is up to scratch for Kyle Baker, but the story seemed to plod on for me, with jokes that made me laugh few and far between. If you are at all interested in Mr. Baker's work, I suggest Undercover Genie. Still this book is worth a read, and you will be supporting a very fine talent in our time."
4,Kyle Baker defines thexpanding frontier of the comics medium,"While not as accessible as Why I Hate Saturn, The Cowboy Wally Show is wonderful in it's own way, but it's very subtle, and as Spead Seduction Guru, Ross Jefferies, says, ""I don't have time for your pathetic subtlety."" Actually, I have quite an appetite for subtlety in comics and The Cowboy Wally Show delivers. Cowboy Wally is a media sensation who is part Johnny Carson, part Ed Wood, and part Benny Hill. It took me a while to decide that I liked this book, but by the time Cowboy Wally recounted the story of shooting his version of Hamlet in a jail cell with just himself, his writer, their two thug cell mates and a box of props, I was hooked."
5,Just buy it already,"This is a funny, funny, book. Cutting social satire at it's peak. I have yet to met anyone who did not think this book was fantastic.Film Producer: Basically, we love the work you guys do and we want another movie from you....We're giving you a buget of 10 million. the thing is, for tax reasons, we need this movie by he end of the fiscal year.Wally: Sure! When's that?Film Producer: Next Friday."
5,A Twisted Classic,"I have to go along with the other reviewers - this is truly a twisted classic. It was the first book of Kyle Baker's I had read, and I never laughed so hard. The tragedy was when I lent my only copy to a friend who lost it (and it had gone out of print). Now that it's back in print, I bought TWO copies - one to keep and one to lend out. Share this with someone who has enough of an off-kilter sense of humor to appreciate this totally original and utterly fall-on-the-floor funny masterpiece."
4,"It's a rootin', tootin', raucous riot of show biz revelry!","This was the first graphic novel created by Kyle Baker. It takes the form of a documentary about the fictional ""fat, loud and stupid"" TV star Cowboy Wally. A journalist is interviewing Cowboy Wally about his life, and clips of ""highlights"" from his less-than-illustrious career are shown. He was in many shows that were cancelled after about two weeks. Probably the true highlights of his career (and also of the graphic novel) are a French Foreign Legion film and a ultra-low budget version of Hamlet. This is a funny comic book, which shows that Kyle Baker had talent even at the beginning of his career."
1,"Not funny, not funny!","After hearing her Decca recording of La Fille du Regiment, I'm disappointed with Sutherland's singing in this performance. It's just sad to hear her way past her prime. High notes are forced and effortful. Timbre is thick, heavy, and mannered. What more, as always, her acting is below mediocre, and as this being a comic opera, the entire performance suffers. Sutherland should have known better than to step back into a role she knows she's not capable of handling anymore. Sorry, but that's how I feel."
3,below Sutherland's best,"If you want to hear and see what Joan Sutherland was really about, don't buy this one, she sounds old and tired. She was close to 60. If you want to hear why La stupenda caused such a sensation during her operatic reign as the Queen of bel canto, I would recommend the following VHS tapes.The ""Voice of Firestone"" The ""Bell Telephone Hour"" The ""Age of bel canto"""
4,Beautiful and peaceful,"These poems are simple and beautiful in nature. Great poems to read first thing in the morning or before a meditation. I didn't find them to be unusually impressive, but knowing the type of life led by the man who wrote them gives them much more power. I recommend it."
5,Thich Nhat Hanh poerty,Amazing how an early life of living in a war zone has broadened the heart to recognize the interdependence of all life
4,Tangerine Dream hit soundtrack gold,"Tangerine Dream's legacy of film soundtracks is littered with mediocre music (nothing like a quick buck, one assumes). But on a few occassions they did hit the mark. Like FIRESTARTER, this soundtrack to William Fredkin's little known remake of THE WAGES OF FEAR is one of the few Tangerine Dream soundtracks that is consistantly good from start to finish. The sound is classic mid-period TD - eerie melodies, somewhat stiff electro rhythms, and wonderfully vintage analog synth sounds. In a few years their sound would develop again into a slicker pop/rock/trance hybrid, but SORCERER remains a perfect snapshot of Tangerine Dream in the mid 70's and comes highly reccomended."
5,brilliant early electronica,"Earlier T Dream releases were filled with long spacey compositions not unlike early Pink Floyd (not a bad thing, by any means), while later releases quickly degenerated into New Age piffle (ignore anything beyond the mid-80s). With shorter tracks and a more cohesive sound, I guess you could say this is more commercial than their earlier stuff, but that would be to ignore the relentless pounding energy and menace that fills this soundtrack, a perfect compliment to the movie. I have listened to this album for 25 years and am still not tired of it."
2,Just a waste of time,"If you have nothing better to do watch it, but don't expect good movies. I could not wait for them to end and get rid of it."
4,A light in the dark,"There is still light in the dark for us,horror fans,because companies like Anchor bay bring us so fantastic DVDs for so fantastic price,and Amazon.com bring it to our homes.This is two horror films from legendary Italian director Lamberto Bavafor the price of one VHS.Macabro is very slow film,it can goes faster,gorier,but if you have the right taste and time,it is not bad film.But Bava can make it better,like he did on second film on this DVD,classic giallo BLADE IN THE DARK.If you like films like DEEP RED or TENEBRE,and still not have it enough,even in this ""bigger and with more and more special effects films"" times,dont waste your time and get it."
5,A Hit,"The best collection of Hendrix imaginable. From blues to rock to metal, Hendrix was the original; The truth of which this album demonstrates. The extra hot spots for a quick listen are Purple Haze, Red House, Maniac Depression, Foxy Lady, and All Along The Watchtower."
5,Completely Addicting!!,"Wow! The first time I heard Jimi Hendrix, I loved it!! I wanted to hear the songs over and over again!! I especially love that song ""Foxy Lady""!!! I simply can't get enough!!"
4,You'll Just End Up Buying the Albums...Trust Me,"I used to own this album, but I traded it away. Why? Because Jimi is too talented for a compilation! This one was good enough to convince me that I need to invest in his real albums."
5,Great Collection,"This is a very nice collection of material from an outstanding and unique musician. I'm not a huge fan of Hendrix and feel that his musical prowess has been blown way out of proportion, but he did have some great recordings. This compilation features many of them. I love his version of ""Star Spangled Banner"" from Woodstock; a very passionate piece on which Jimi used his guitar as a means of expression in an entirely unparalleled manner. Another favorite track is Hendrix's soulful rendition of Dylan's ""All Along the Watchtower"", a song that Jimi made his own (though U2's version is also powerful). If, like myself, you aren't a diehard Hendrix devotee and just like the guy enough to want a great collection of his material, I'd highly recommend this one."
4,a good variety,"If youre going to get acquainted with any rock legend by way of a greatest hits album, this is a good starting point"
1,terrible,many of hendrixes more popular hits were stolen. how unoriginal. and people think he's awesome for this? what retards.
5,The Ultimate Experience,"I am now ordering a used copy for a friend overseas who is learning about music. What a gift! This is one of 4 or 5 CDs I keep close to me for those times when you really really need music to make your life better (like last week, 9/11/01 - peace).Best song: #13 Red House - The Blues, oh the Blues."
5,hendrix,how could i not rate jimi any but five star one of the greatest guitar gods of all time and this cd has it all
5,Total Package,"I could go on and on, but this is what you need to know - Total Hendrix Package. If you are looking for a ""best of"" this is the one. It's classic hit after classic hit featuring Jimi's best all in one place. You even get some unexpected treats like ""Burning Of The Midnight Lamp"" and ""Gypsy Eyes"". Then, to cap it off, you get two classic Hendrix live performances. This is a must have for any complete CD collection.Top Tracks: ""Hey Joe"", ""Voodoo Child (Slight Return)"", ""Little Wing"", ""The Star Spangled Banner (Live)"""
1,"Amusing, but B.S.","Read this if you enjoy preposterous historical conjecture (I often do), but be aware that (as other reviewers have stated) many claims are made that are debatable or just plain wrong (the usual baloney Templar links to the Sinclairs, for instance, and his casual claim that William Keith of Galston was a Templar)."
3,"Interesting, yet doesn't quite hit the mark","Mr. Pinkham begins with a growing in popularity theme, yet doesn't quite hit the mark with the book until the last few chapters (which comprise less then 1/3 of the book). The time spent on older traditions, the Fisher Kings, Vulcan-Lucifer, and Venus, all be them interesting, are not tied into the Templar Mystery terribly well, but his attempt to set the stage for understanding of John the Baptist, and his role in those lines is made. A lot of information is presented in the book, yet I finsihed feeling the book was lacking, and not as interesting as I had hoped. As a supplement to deeper understanding of the Templars, I think this book can add valuable information, as an introduction, I think there are better ones available."
2,"Content is interesting, but there are a lot of problems with this book","If you are the type that gets annoyed by bad editing, you probably won't be able to read this book. Flat out, this has got to be the most poorly edited book I have ever seen - if you can even say that it was edited at all. One sentence early on started with ""12"". Come on! Who does that? It's brutal in terms of typos, gramatical errors, and just poor definition.Editing (or the lack thereof) aside, the content is fairly interesting. The book's structure leaves a bit to be desired, but by the time you get to the end you have a good idea of what the author is trying to convey. The interviews at the end are quite interesting.Whether some of the content is believable is another story. The author says things like ""it's been proven"" or ""it is fact that.."" in regard to a few things which are still very much in debate and/or have been debunked entirely. That definitely introduces a credibility problem."
5,Petty's Greats,"This cd includes the best of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.If you love his music then this is a ""must have"",for sure!"
5,This is it,If you are a Tom Petty fan this cd has it all....even ones that maybe were not big hits..fun trip down memory lane
4,FL Boys Rock It,"I love this recording, it has most of my favorite songs. The absence of You Wrecked Me is the only reason I didn't go with 5 stars"
4,Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers Greatest Hits Collection,"This is a really good CD, but not a great one! The best songswould be Runnin' Down a Dream, Free Fallin', & Mary Jane's LastDance. Runnin' Down a Dream has some of the best heavy metal riffs I've ever heard, plus great driving song. It is also a considered classic of the late eighties that you hear on the radio a lot! Other tracks that I like are considered to be I Won't Back Down, Learnin' to Fly, Refugee, I Need to Know, Breakdown, & Don't Do Me Like That. All of those songs are considered radio classics that you hear a lot on the radio.This is a classic album, get this."
3,GARAGE ROCK DELUXE,"Its speedy tempo and wanton delivery makes for a satisfying CD. Balladeerng, he once was a hard rocker. These songs prove his worthiness in my hall of fame. Sometimes I can't sleep at nite."
5,Everything was Great,This CD is really a Best Hits CD because there isnt a bad song on it. My shipment arrived early as well. I was definately satisfied.
5,PETTY ROCKS!!!!!!!,"Listening to anything else is just waisting time, get this CD, get all his CDs, then get his boxed set, you can't be dissappointed. He takes the best of Rock 'n' Roll and goes way beyond. Refugee Rules!"
5,great,The song Runnin' Down a Dream is really one of the best by TP&TH.; I mean some of the greatest heavy metal in history ofrock is that song. That song needs to be repeated. Free Fallonis allso one of the greatest ever worked on! And that's anothersong to repeat. This album is must needed so pick this one uptoday and get it along with 8 other albums on my list.THE CARS COMPLETE GREATEST HITSLOVE OVER GOLD DIRE STRIATSFORIEGNER COMPLETE GREATEST HITSGUNS N ROSES GREATEST HITSFORTY LICKS THE ROLLING STONESAEROSMITHS OH YEAH ULTIMATE HITSBOSTON GREATEST HITSAND BEATLES 1
4,"Classic ""Tom Petty"" collection.","This 18 track disc is just about as perfect as one disc could be. The first half is full of classic cuts, including ""American Girl"" and ""Refugee"", and the last half has ""I Won't Back Down"" and ""Learning To Fly"", among others. Plus the two new songs (at the time), are both just as great. One of my favorites is the very 80's, but excellent ""Don't Come Around Here No More"". Remember the video? The only thing I really wish, is that this was released 1-2 years later. Then it could have included something from the wonderful ""Wildflowers"" album. Even the 2-disc ""Anthology"" has nothing from that. But still, this is all classic ""Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers"", and it will go great with your ""Mellencamp"" and ""Springsteen"" cd's."
5,Music At It's Best..!!,"If someone wanted a primer on what a great American rock band is all about, Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers would be THE band to listen to. The songwriting is taut, soaring and shows how a real band crafts their tunes once the writer has penned the initial song. The musicianship is at a high level. Benmont Tench has learned well from ""The Booker T. School of Hammond B3 and Mike Campbell is without a doubt the most talented American guitarist around if not the most underated, his playing is simply drenched in total economy, color and taste. Tom Petty is what a rhythm player should be (a somewhat under appreciated role in many bands) and the rhythm section of Ron Blair and Stan Lynch are rock solid. This is a superb collection of this band's hits and your musical world will only be enhanced by listening to Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers - Greatest Hits."
4,"Not a fan, but this is very good","I'm not a Tom Petty fan, but I've been listening to this CD a lot. ""Last Dance With Mary Jane"", ""Running Down a Dream"", ""Free Fallin"" & ""Learning to Fly"" are great songs."
3,Incomplete best of collection,"There are plenty of quality tunes here. But my favorite Tom Petty song is ""Like A Rolling Stone"". I can't beleive it's not on his ""best of"" collection...it was a huge hit! Who compiled this CD? Rolling Stone?"
2,This is a total waste of your money.,"I thought that this disc would be worth the money, but I was wrong by a long shot. First off, half of the songs I have never heard of before even though I am a big fan of Tom Petty. I thought the words GREATEST HITS meant that they were the best songs they have sung. That doesn't count that the only good song is Free Fall'en and a few others. This is a total waste of your money so I would recommend not to by this CD."
2,so/so,he has catchy lyrics but all his music sounds exactly the same.which is a fact he addmitted himself.musically overall he is a poor man's bruce springstien.i'll give him credit for longevity.
5,great!,"this is the music that lives through the years. any time i am in a ""music slump"" i put this on and everything becomes right again! thanks tom for all the years of great listening...."
5,Tom Petty is the greatest!,"To me, Tom Petty is one of the most talented people I know. He is from Gainesville, FL, and I knew him as a boy through teen-age years. He was a friend of my brother and sister. I am 68, they are all three the same age, even to the month (October) and year (1950). Seriously, though, who would have guessed that this little punk kid from our neighborhood would turn out to be what he is today? He is the greatest in my book."
4,really fine tunes,I love Tom Petty. This a good collection of his music. Particularly nostalgic for a dino rocker like me
5,All the best!,"This CD kicks off with the great ""American Girl"" and does not slow down all the way through. ""Last Dance With Mary Jane"" has the best guitar riff and the lyrics are superb. From the early work like ""I Need to Know"" and ""Refugee"" to the 80's hits like ""Don't Come Around Here No More"" (remember that video?!) and the 90's ""Into the Great Wide Open"". My faves are ""Refugee"", ""Free Fallin'"" and ""You Got Lucky"" - but there is NOT a bad song on this CD!I find myself singing along with nearly all of the songs, they are classic and catchy. This is a great anytime CD, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers rock!"
4,Better singer than Dylan,"I'm not a big Tom Petty fan but this is a very very good album. I'm not that familiar with his earlier work but like everything on this disc beginning with 'Don't come round here no more'. Considering the time span on this recording, the quality is really impressive. My favourite song? 'Free Fallin'. Lots of great guitar work on this set. A couple of tracks remind me of the Beatles sound."
4,Gainsville Giants,"Since the mid 70's, Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers have made their own landscape into rock and roll. Their 1993 greatest hits is a pure showcase of their musical talent.Each of their songs still have a mass appeal to a certain kind of audience. The music also contains dynamic songs from Petty's solo album, Full Moon Fver, as well as standard Heartbreaker hits from their outstanding career.Considering that the band is set to celebrate their 25th anniversary this year, and to be inducted into the Rock n' Roll Hall Of Fame, this ""near diamond selling"" album is a must for any pure Tom Petty fan."
5,Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers Greatest Hits.,This cd was in the best condition of any used cd I have purchased on Amazon.com.
5,An essential recording,"While I own every album he ever made, this greatest hits package is a great one CD compilation. It makes regular appearances in my CD changer."
5,Tom is a cool dude!,"Have the cd in our car so can listen to it often! Love it! Has all the good songs on it, any Tom Petty fan should have this one! My favourite cd rite now!"
4,Tom is one of my all time favorites,My knock on this album is it lacks a few cuts that I find essential. Every cut on this album is great. I think I can supplement what is missing.
5,Tom Petty,Very disapointed that I can not down load to my library. I have attempted all recommended program downloads. I will not purchase any more mp3 downloads.
5,Some of the best music you'll ever hear,"This greatest hits package of Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers shows the essence of Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers' greatness. Every track is flawless and makes you want to say 'this is Tom Petty's best song.' While I am a Tom Petty fan and own most of his albums, I feel that if you want the essential Tom Petty on one disc than this is the album to buy. You should however consider buying ""Wildflowers"" because that material isn't represented on this album and it's some of his best work. Words cannot describe how great the songs on this album are. They have stuck, grown, and got better with me since the first day I heard them. They are a part of my life now."
2,Tom petty and the heart breakers greatest hits,"I personally did not care for the cd, because I think that it left out most of their best songs."
2,Could have been so much more,"Erotic? Well...this is one of those movies that could have been so much more. How many films in this genre mess with your head just like this? It's a decent script, with decent dialogue; it sets up a very erotic sexual situation...you sit there anticipating this explosion...and then...nothing! And you sit there going, ""Man, if they only had done this or that; it could have been a great scene!"" This movie did it four times. Once with Brandy Davis' boyfriend and a second girl, twice with Brandy and her neighbor, and once in her fantasy sequence at a party. Don't these directors get it? I'm not even a professional and I get it."
5,Fast Service.....Satisfied Customer!,The product came to me as promised. It arrived quickly and I was satisfied with delivery. I would order again....if needed.
4,Oral B Electric Tooth Brush,I bought it Dec 11 and it lasted one month and one week. One day it turned on and wouldn't go off. If not for that I would have given it a 5 as I expected it to last much longer.
3,Great DVD. Crippled CD.,"The DVD is awesome. Played through the whole thing on my Mac without a hitch. This DVD is an EXCELLENT live set. All the eras are covered, and no one who is a fan should be disappointed in their show.HOWEVER... the CD portion of the DVD which claims to ""play anywhere"" will not play on either Macintosh computer (my primary CD player is my Mac.) It churns, grinds, spurts, and tries, but in the end, it just spits it out.3 Stars. It would be 4 if they didn't CRIPPLE THE CD. It's not ""protected""... it's CRIPPLED!Stop treating PAYING CUSTOMERS LIKE THIEVES and we will buy your stuff.I am VERY VERY disappointed. I expect better from Twisted Sister. Heck, ""Still Hungry"" played in my Mac fine... so why can't this?At least the DVD played."
2,My second copy worked...,"After having to return my first copy because the DVD was defective, the second copy played all the way thru. I do not like the DVD mix of the interviews between songs of the concert. You should be able to choose ""play concert"" or ""play rockumentary"". I'm interested in both, but it takes away from the power of the live show when you bring it down after every song to someone talking for 5 minutes before the next song begins. I had to turn the volume down every time it cuts back to an interview because the volume was louder than the concert for some reason."
1,"Great release, manufacturing defects","Long story short: Bought this item, CD side was defect (melted plastic on surface), Amazon was great and offered me a replacement copy without having to return the item. Recived the replacement disc, same problem... Audio side won't play. Amazon has been great through this though, they have now refunded all my expenses; the problem lies with the manufacturer. Hopefully they get the problem sorted out, and I will order this item again!"
1,Poor Quality,"My wife bought me a .45 wide angle lense to go with my Canon S1 IS digital camera.The pictures on the box showed this lense to be exactly what I wanted - greatly increased view in the picture, limited curving and sharply focused. I took several ""test pictures"" and they looked fine on my LCD display on the camera. However, when I transfered them to my laptop, they were aweful - very blurry. A very small area in the center was ok, but everything else was quite blurry. I even zoomed in on objects and took pictures with and without the lense. The lense makes the photo useless.I would never buy a Raynox lense."
1,Overpriced.,You can get an equivalent chicken rack that can hold a 12 oz can for less than $5 from pretty much any hardware or grill store.
2,Well written but women irritatingly passive -- or passe.,"Adams is a great writer and story teller and I was swept up in her story right away. I found, however, that the main character and her best friend were just too passive about their love lives for me to relate to. Continuing to date men they did not like because they did not want to hurt their feelings, not calling the police when they were being stalked, it just did not ring true for me."
4,Quality Lens Protection,"I've been a user of Montana based Op/Tech's line of fast caps since I picked them at a trade show a few years ago. The overall quality of their gear speaks volumes. I picked up this 67mm Fast Cap to protect my Nikkor 18-105mm lens. Just like their other caps its gone the distance and protected my camera lens well.The cover easily attaches and stays on without any slippage. Unlike the flimsy, cheap glue based string systems, I don't have to worry about the hinged Fast Cap falling off. It covers the bases in protecting my lens from both dust and scratches. The seal is pretty much water tight too. Most photographs that I've seen of this product seem to depict this product in a lighter color. Its black and is available in other sizes ranging from 49mm, 52mm, 55mm, 58mm to 62mm.For me, these Op/Tech lens caps are durable and cost effective tools. I've not had any problems with them since I made the switch. They are built to last. That's good enough for me."
4,Op/tech flip open lens cap,"This is a clever device that Amazon.com makes available. The ""O"" ring seal is useful for me as I live near the ocean, so salt spray and moisture are kept off the lens when the cap is closed. The cap hinge is easy to move for your preferred position when open. The unit is only a little larger / bulkier than a standard lens cap. I found that at maximum wide angle of 24mm on my Canon SX 40, the lens cover cuts the corners on the image. All other focal lengths work fine. In all other ways, if you are constantly losing lens caps, this is the solution."
5,Core-strengthening Workout,"The results I got from working out with this DVD were amazing. Sure, I lost some weight but that's not what the focus for me was. I was all about strengthening my core to ease some of the back pain I used to have. Slowly but surely, I've seen great improvement. I feel stronger, have better posture and have finally found a low-impact exercise that I actually enjoy! I highly recommend the Pilates For Dancers to anyone, dancer or not!"
2,Not for the advanced,"Hello, My Grandmother could do this!!!!I can not figure out how you would get the body of a dancer from this workout. I expected it to be alot more challenging.Too junior for the advanced, but if you are just getting started it would be a good choice."
1,remake,This is a remake of the Homecomming. It is an exact copy so since I already had the homecomming it was a waste of money.
4,Ginger Ale = Vernor's,"I live in Ohio. The only name that comes to mind when anyone says ""ginger ale"" is Vernor's!"
4,5 for rats 3 for hell of living dead,first of all its true all the rats being killed in this film are real but thats wat they did back then to make movies look real and the movie was great let me tell you but hell of the living dead desapointed me because it was kinda boring and zombies warnt that good but gores great and is still a must see trust me im a great itallian horror fan.
4,Pop-O-Pies Anthology,It's this kind of music that got me through the 80's. If you like any of the bands on SST or Alternative Tentacles then you'll grin like a fool when you listen to this CD. Just another reason not to take life too seriously.
5,Loved the movie...and loved the book even more!,"I have always loved the movie, and was very curious when I heard there was a novelization of it written by the man who wrote the screenplay of the film. I had heard that it was far superior to the movie, going into a lot more detail and character development than the film could afford.And so...I made it my mission to get my hands on said book.I was not disappointed.It really does go into a lot more detail, and is much more fleshed out. And in the end, I ended up loving this novel so much more than the movie itself...that I rarely watch the movie anymore, and simply read the book instead (I still love the movie, and still think it was fantastic).If you're curious about this novelization, then don't hesitate to get a copy. It's well worth it!"
1,Where is this guy going?,The music on this 2 cd set is mostly insturmental but I wonder where this guy is going half the time. He plays a good rip but stops in the middle of a piece and starts over. I would like to hear him in a rock blues band with a great singer. These 2 cds did nothing for me. lost patinence with it. For fans of this stuff only!!
3,"Not great, could have covered more complex issues","Book covers all of the basic deductions. The J.K Lasser's small business taxes book is much better. Everything in this book is available on the IRS website. In fact, much of this book seems to be just a rewrite of the standard IRS tax guides."
3,Whoops !,I found a significant error in this book. Medigap policies were listed as both a valid medical deduction and an invalid medical deduction.
4,J.K. Lasser's 1001 Deductions and Tax Breaks 2006,"Although I am not an accountant, the book is very informative, detailed and seems very complete. It has been a great asset to me as I prepare my 2005 taxes."
2,white guilt all over again,"this movie like american history x was right on the money in the start. but as always the white guilt kicks in and whitey is the evil one. so you know how its going to end. when are they going to make a movie about the evils of other hate groups, oh wait there just patted on the back for hating whitey and given money to keep expanding. thumbs down for the typical hollywood ending. why is it when the white man and woman are proud and have racial idenity they are evil and bad and must be struck down? but we constantly pat the back of those who hate the white man but love the white woman."
5,The Next Best Thing To Being There,"Joe Ely is one of those rare artists whose songs improve in a live setting--not that his first three albums that this set derives from aren't all terrific and should be part of your collection as well. But with the recent release of his third live album (Live at Antone's), I'm reminded of what a terrific collection of songs this 1980 release is. This was a superb live band featuring lead guitarist Jesse Taylor and accordian player Ponty Bone.Recorded during an English tour with The Clash, Ely tears through originals like ""Fingernials"" and ""Johnny's Blues,"" along with rave-up versions of ""Honky Tonkin'"" and ""Long Snake Moan.""When I bought this on vinyl when it first came out it included a 4-song EP, which is included on this CD as the final four tracks--the highlight is the Buddy Holly classic ""Not Fade Away.""This is high octane stuff. Ely's brand of country/rock and Tex/Mex is riveting and deserves to be heard by a wider audience. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
4,Black Flowers,Black FlowersThis was an excellent read from the beginning to the last page. I would love to see more by this author.
5,Heartwarming and full of wisdom!,"This memoir is refreshingly unique - a fictional story interwoven around his and his father's personalities and the life lessons meant to jolt one's mind into deeper thought. Dr. Ehly is one of those few genuinely joyful souls in the world, existing to touch lives in the most profound way. Every student he had left the Conservatory a better musician and a better person. If you read only one memoir, read one that can truly add something to your own life. Hogey does just that.--Vicki Landes, author of ""Europe for the Senses - A Photographic Journal"" and UMKC Conservatory of Music, class of 1999"
5,Excellent in Every Way,"I thought everything about this production; singing, acting and production was excellent; one of the best opera dvds I have ever seen."
2,boring gabber zzzz,"i bought this after hearing omar santana's ""hardcore moederneuker"", expecting it to sound at least somewhat like that track. i was sorely disappointed when i discovered this album to be, for the most part, just another heap of gabber excretum: slow (relatively), formulaic and commercial - since when is this hardcore?! the cd picks up a bit towards the end but ultimately disappointed me....if this sort of softcore just bores you to tears, try out Disciples of Annihilation's ""NYC Speedcore"", ""Disco Inferno"" by Delta 9, or anything by Nasenbluten!!"
2,lacks detail,"Note: My review pertains to the first ten pages of the book which concerned graduate programs in Archaeology. I found this book to be rather uninformative. It merely stated the names of several programs without any detail concerning professors, course work, or degree requirements. It left-out a number of excellent programs that are available in the country. It was a superficial, glossed-over, synopsis that was a waste of my $20."
1,"Terrible. I wanted to like this CD, but it is all talk, poor music","I have never owned an Ani Defranco CD before. I wanted to hear her music, because I thought I would like it based on my other musical preferences. I randomly bought this CD used. I thought one of her LIVE albums would make a good into to her music.Unfortunately most of what I got with this CD is talking. Each track has approximately 1 1/2 minutes of her talking nonsense before each song begins. When she does sing, her guitar playing is no better than average and her lyrics are sub par.In Ani's defense, I hope its just this album, but I'm hesitant to buy any more."
3,"Excellent dancing, dim production","I agree with other reviewers - the dancing in this production is absolutely superb. However, I did not care for the design at all. Almost everything is executed in silvery-grey shades that look more monotonous than delicate on VHS, and some of the backdrops have a huge scale and weird perspective that are very distracting. That said, and somewhat to my surprise, my 4-year-old is clearly charmed by the video and will watch as much of it as I will allow at one sitting."
3,Cabinet of Dr Carabosse,"Great great dancing! Fantastic music! But the designs! YIKES!Alas, design plays a huge part in this ballet, more so than in most. And this production's are crap. Ugly and dark and inexplicable, the sets belong to some German expressionist silent film or an Alfred Hitchcock suspense climax. Where are Kim Novak and Jimmy Stuart when you need them? And Edith Head....who might have saved the show costume-wise.Y'know part of the fun of this ballet is the sleeping court waking up in styles that are 100 years old. Then everyone is gloriously ""up to date"" for the whoop-de-do in Act III. In this version the court sees no reason to change. This and utterly bizzare stuff like shaking, floating dinner chairs with Carabosse emerging from under the table just make one moan.But the fabulous dancing and mime [Carabosse is wonderful....even if she does come from under the table] just make one smile with joy. Definitely worth seeing at least once."
1,A Good Performance but a Travesty on DVD,"Only if you have a TV screen of about nine inches will this DVD look sharp. On a normal size TV it is very fuzzy. On a big screen TV it is essentially unwatchable. It's hard to believe this performance is on the market in a DVD format. Most of the good reviews seem to have been from VHS tape watchers, where the picture quality expectations are low. But I have never even seen a commercial VHS tape with picture quality this poor. How can I get my money back?"
4,discussing about the scientific explanation of breeding,good for budgee breeder. you will know the type that you gonna have based on the mating charts. worth buying.
1,Amateur Night,"There is some very sprightly music in this performance, where the singers occasionally allow a pleasant sound to emerge (but not enough to spoil us), interrupted by tediously directed scenes straining much too hard to be funny. The actors/singers awkwardly move chairs around a lot to remind us that this is not a concert performance. Disagreements among the singers and the conductor regarding tempi are presented to us with great force. The comedy presumably depends on a sophisticated ambiguity regarding the contrasting mannerisms of nobility, bohemians, and servants, but the director seems to think that we would prefer a rather vulgar muddle instead. Artistic unity is achieved by lots of shouting and shrieking in both the songs and the spoken sections. Every now and then we are allowed a glimpse of lovely music, reminding us that Offenbach knew what he was doing, even if this production doesn't quite understand the work at all."
3,Nothing to write home about....,"I owe 2 other Offenbach productions-""La Belle Helene"" staged by the Zurich Opera and ""Orphee aux Enfers"" staged by Lyon National Opera(available in Zone 0 format from Amazon.co.uk)which are much better than this one.After viewing the hilarious Orphee aux Enfers I was rather disapointed by this comparetively boring production,and since the first and only viewing,it stays abandoned in a corner...With a title like ""Vie Parisienne"" you expect a ""rich bubbling champagne"" but what you get is a rather ""dry Cabernet"".Although it has some good moments of singing and dancing and very nice music,it somehow doesn't tie together and leaves you with a sensation of heaviness.I agree with the other reviewer that it looks more like a sung play and it's a pity.I don't recommend this production.Go and look for a good CD version instead."
3,"Good music, Mediocre performance","Offenbach wrote delightful music for his operettas and the orchestra plays it very well, which is why I give this DVD 3 stars instead of lower. The performance, although the costumes are nice, tends to be boring in spots because of the staging. Also, some of the singers, who were no more than adequate, had trouble maintaining the same tempo as the conductor and orchestra."
4,"Tasteful, But Slightly 'Dry'","Hoffman's 'La Vie Parisiene,' here performed by a modern Paris 'opera,' has some very impressive moments. Overall, though, it feels a bit 'stiff', that is to say, some scenes seem to have trouble jump-starting themselves into effective entertainment, art, or action.But note I have given this DVD 4-stars. If you like Hoffman and modern Paris drama sung in French, this DVD might interest you. The acting and the costumes are intriguing, as is the storyline. You have to give these performers a lot of credit, for the lines they sing are incredibly challenging in terms of syllabic structure, rapidity, and intonation. These are expert thespians and I would love to watch them perform in something more 'rich' than this slightly dry ""La Vie Parisienne.'This can hardly be called an opera, however, for it really is more like a play which is sung. When I think of 'opera', I think of 'Lakme,' 'Madame Butterfly,' or 'Turandot,' not 'La Vie Parisienne.'"
5,Finally a quiet airline flight,"I purchased the headphones before I left for a Thanksgiving trip to San Francisco, four hours from Detroit. The engine noise was muted as was conversations around me. The trip back on the red eye was also great as I slept and did not hear flight attendants talking. Great purchase and I would recommend them to any one."
2,Noise canceling technology gives me headaches,"The sound quality is fabulous, however, the noise canceling technology in the headphones cause my ears to ache and also giving me a mild headache. I typically never get headaches, but after using these headphones over extended periods (hour plus) results in headaches and ear irratation, regardless of music genre or volume."
1,disentergrated in my hand.Big Quality problems or choose cheap plastic so you will upgrade every few years...What a joke,"Went to Bose store in Burlington Mass for a new cable cause it was intermitent. Problem no 1. Brought it home and where it piviots, completed disintergrated in my hands. I was doing nothing but holding it in my hands and put it on the table. Problem 2. What a joke! Anyway, I did buy the QC15. Trapped so I did the upgrade for $150.00. I would try some other noise cancelling phones first before going to Bose. The Bose phones sound are very good, comfort is a 9 out of 10, but quality is a complete joke. $300 for cheap plastic. The cabling should be alot sturdier then what is given. I have a Grado SR-60 and Shennheiser 595HD and they are much more durable. I've had the grado for 5 years and it is still new looking. I used them almost every day for couple of years and it is still in perfect condition. I'm sure Bose knows about the problem and want you to do the $150.00 upgrade."
3,"Great noise cancellation, decent sound, bad price...","Overall I really dig these headphones. Sonically, they are detailed but feel a little dead, particularly in the midrange. If you are a home listener, you can probably find better audio quality for the price. These actually do what they promise- cancel noise. Some of the reviewers seem to have the misconception that these would eliminate all outside sound, but they are using too loose a definition of 'noise.' These will eliminate droning or constant sounds like fans, engines, A/C, etc. They are very helpful for lessening ear fatigue in noisy vehicles or airplanes. This is actually the only BOSE product I have ever liked, interestingly enough. Mostly I think they produce novelty stereo equipment which audio-ignorant rich people purchase."
1,Serious structural issues combined with terrible customer support,"Great sound and great comfort. That's where the good qualities stop. The headset on this product is of extremely poor design and materials. My headset fell apart after being used sparingly over the course of 1.5 years. The kicker is that for such an expensive product, the company essentially could care less to have you back as a returning customer. They were unresponsive to my requests for parts support - they only wanted me to upgrade to a new pair. DO NOT BUY ANY BOSE PRODUCTS. You would do better to flush your hard earned money down the toilet. Did I mention that you should NOT BUY ANY BOSE PRODUCTS?"
5,Great over-the-ear style headphones,"If you're like me, and you don't like the feeling/pressure of the on-the-ear style headphones (QC3), give the QC2 headphones a try. I love mine."
2,Blose,"I am so disappointed in the sound quality of these headphones. The noise cancelling feature is great, but really what's the point in cancelling out outside noise when you're stuck with crap sound quality? I'm really stunned because my Bose stereo sounds awesome. That's why I trusted them to deliver with these headphones. They didn't. Luckily it's not too late to return them and try a few suggestions I've read in these reviews."
1,Not worth 300 bucks,"If these headphones were $50 they might be something to rave about. The sound quality is decent and the noise cancellation works.These headphones are extremely uncomfortable to wear. I wouldn't expect to use them on long flights. The comfort of noise cancellation is very much outweighed the discomfort of having them on. However, my wife found them much more comfortable than I. If you have a larger hat size you might want to try something else.The design and materials are flawed for a product so spendy. After a bit less than a years use by my wife the on/off switch wore out. She might have used the switch as many as 3 times a day. I'd guess she used the switch maybe 1000 times at the outside before it wore out. Also one of the swivels attaching the phone to the head strap broke after only a years use.If you contemplate getting service on your headphones from Bose, even if you are willing to pay for it -- forget it."
3,bose quiet comfort 2 review,"These headphones seem to work pretty well, even thought they are fairly light, and I am used to a heavier product. Kind of plastic, would have preferred metal. But quality of sound is excellent."
4,Too sensitive for its price but excellent customer support,"A couple of months after I bought it, the left side started to malfunction producing a very annoying sound. However, customer support replaced the whole product at a very convenient and fast way.All in all very good product, both for the noise reduction and the quality it offers for listening to music. Yes its pricey, but i guess this reflects the high demand for that product."
2,theres better and cheaper headphones than this,"These headphones are overpriced and do not have as good quality as you think. I would highly recomend buying Creative Labs HN-700 Noise cancelling headphones for only about 50 bucks. Dont waste your time and money on overpriced, poorly designed, EXTREMELY FRAGILE headphones."
4,Not worth THAT much money..,"I would've put a 5 if the price wasn't so dang high.. In terms of quality, from my experience with them, they're pretty much the Rolls Royce of phase cancellation headphones. But I wouldn't feel very smart knowing that I just got ripped off by Bose... If you got the money to spare and you want the quality of Bose, then go for it.. If you want quality, but not a huge price tag to go along with it.. Then I'd go for the Sony MDR-NC50's.. I bought my pair of the Sony's and, to me, they sound just as good..Cheers!"
5,My Best flights ever...,"I bought these headphones on the recommendation of a friend, and he was sooo right! The moment when the noice-cancelling algorithm kicks-in on a noisy flight is just sublime. I frequently use them without input, just tuning out the background noise on the aircraft...they even work well on squalling rug-rats a few rows away...."
2,Pricey for the performance,I purchased both this item and the Sennheiser at the same time to see which was the better purchase. Both my wife and I tested them and independently (we did a blind vote so to speak) and both concluded the Sennheiser was equivalent noise reduction and sound quality - at half the price. We returned the bose and purchased three more Sennheiser's for ourselves and our boys.tom
1,Headsets Fall Apart,"The sound was awesome - no question about it - but the headphones fell apart after 8 months. The cheap plastic used to connect the ear pieces to the head piece cracked and eventually broke, and now a sharp piece of metal sticks into my head if I ever wear them. I needed to tape them with hockey tape to hold them together.....I expect better for $300![Look in the product images for pictures of where they broke]"
4,Good headphones that only work with battery,"This is a good set of headphones. I also bought my first pair on Amazon.com; the headphones and the experience worked well so I bought the replacement pair on Amazon.com. I mainly use them for plane travel without the cord, because these days it is less common to find a music jack on a plane. Unfortunately, they only work with a battery. If the battery is flat or missing, or the noise-canceling circuit is switched off, the headphones do not work."
3,Good noise cancelling - BOOMY Bass!!!,"These phones are pretty comfortable, but I have had problems with the earcup material flaking off. The noise cancelling works pretty well, but the bass is too boomy - which is very typical for a Bose product. They sound great at first, but the over-emphasized bass wears on me after awhile. Most Bose products have this deficiency, but they are very popular nonetheless. Audio Techinca makes a better product for half the price - check it out..."
1,"Great Sound, But They Fall Apart...","I was happy with the headphones until the plastic on the headband started cracking and fell apart. I'm extremely carefull with them and they have had very light use. From what I've discovered reading other reviews, it's a common problem and appears to be poor quality plastic and a bad design. Bose will replace them for $100. But after investing $300 and expecting these to last many years, I'm going to cut my loses. No more Bose headphones for me. I told the Bose representative that I planned to wrap duct tape on the headphones to help hold them together and explain to everyone I see why I had to do this, and he really didn't seem to care. I wouldn't buy these headphones as there are other options out there."
5,Every day use,I use my Bose headset every day for work. I work in a very busy office and have a job that demands my total concentration.Pro's:The most comfortable headset money can buy.I have not once had sore ears from the padding surrounding the speakers.Sound is good.Con's:The noise cancelling is not that great. While it takes the punch out of noise you can still hear conversations 10 feet from you clearly.A bit bulky.Can't easily replace the ear pads.Expensive...Generally I love my Bose headphones but noise cancellation is not as great as they market it to be. try some before you buy them to set expectations.
3,Handle With Care,"The sound is great, but not uniquely great as others would have you believe. There are cheaper products out there that perform just as well. My main issue with the Q2's is how fragile they are. I have not had an opportunity to travel with them. I've just used them at home. the plastic if very fragile and easily breaks. I would have thought, for $300 the product would be much sturdier."
1,Overpriced and Flimsy,"Bose markets on its name, spends a lot of money on advertising, and charges much more for these headphones than they are worth. You can get equal or superior headphones (Sony for example) for half. My current favorite is the Sony in ear ear bud design with noise cancelling feature. Compact, and better at blocking external noises because they sit in the ear. And only 99.95."
1,Never work.... it was a scam,"Email the seller and never email me back, the headphones are broken and the seller never answer my emails. It was a scam be aware of buying from this person."
3,Would buy something different next time.,"Not sure what it is about these things. I commute a lot (both on the bus and on the plane). They do pretty well but their performance is not consistent. My ears get ""tired"" from fluctuation in ambient noise and from the feeling of having ""suction ear cups"" over my ears. I do like them better then noise isolating earphones that go in your ear canal. At least with the Bose I can chew a meal or turn my head side to side without hearing the scraping sound of the headphone cable rubbing against my shirt collar.All in all, not that bad performance wise, but the price needs to come down to get more then a 3 star rating.Thank you."
2,Not Spectacular,"I was anticipating a ""sanctuary"" experience (as the advertsiment promises), when on a recent flight. In truth, the noise suppression was not spectacular, and the volume of the music coming from an mp3 player was too soft to be really appreciated. I don't know if this has to do with the resistance of the speakers, but even with the volume of the creative mp3 player at maximum setting, it was a wisper, while this is not the case with my regular earphones. As for the ambient engine noise, it was still very much present."
2,Not bad but a bit over priced,"I've used it on several flights now. It does not completely block out all noise but it does an adqueate job so that I can listen to my Ipod without going deaf during a flight and it allows me to snooze during a flight. I recommend the bigger orgiinal quietcomfort because, it uses 1 AAA battery. I rather carry a AAA battery on a flight rather than a bulky recharger which is what's required for the smaller quietcomfort 2. The headphones are not adequate for vacuuming or for mowing the lawn; it doesn't block out enough noise for those uses."
1,Bose Blows...,We bought our first pair when we lived in New York City - it was a big investment for us - as rent is so large there! We received the second pair as a gift. BOTH PAIRS BROKE! AT THE EAR PIECE... We're leaving Bose for Audio Technica and from the massive amount positive reviews there - lower price and better construction - we're excited to head to a new world of better quality and lower prices!Don't buy BOSE unless you don't want quality and longevity! Bose knows about this and doesn't care because they are getting away with fraud!
5,Nothing else on the market can compare,"I thought I would save a little money so I first bought the Sony MDR NC20 headphones. Yes, they do cancel noise, but they aren't very comfortable. I proceded to try two other noise cancelling brands before I finally bit the bullet and bought the Bose. WOW. There is no comparison in sound, noise cancellation, or comfort. Don't waist any more money on any other brand. Just get them. If for any other reason you will have a great stress reducing, life enhancing experience, just tuning out the rest of the world as you listen to crystal clear music."
2,They broke,"As other reviewers have stated, the headband is flimsy. I bought mine in December 2004, less than 9 months ago. The headband began cracking a few months ago and today an earpiece completely snapped off. That this thing is now held together with Scotch tape is unacceptable for something so expensive.Noise reduction is great, and sound quality ok. I frequently wear these coupled with a pair of foam earplugs to completely block out the world. Even in this configuration, with the input jack set to High I can listen to iTunes with no problems.UPDATE: Bose replaced them in accordance with the warranty. Shipped the broken ones off and the replacements arrived in about two weeks."
5,BOSE Rocks!,"I've had the speakers for over a year now, and they are fantastic... have used them on almost a daily basis (great at work).... they bring out the nuances in music. Clarity is fantastic!BOSE customer support is fantastic to boot. After a Year, plastic strip cracks.... I call BOSE to get a new strip...BOSE replaces my headphones free of charge!!!!"
5,good buy,This is third set of noise reducing headphones I got for taking naps in a room with a noisy macaw. It works quite well while its competetors were lacking.
1,Great for a while...,"I've had my Quiet Comfort 2 headphones for about three years. For the last two years, I've been repairing them with tape because the headband keeps falling apart. I was surprised to read several user reviews that mention the same problem. The plastic is poor quality and starts breaking from normal use after about a year. I've never dropped them, stepped on them, sat on them, thrown them, or done anything with them other than place them on my head. And yet, they are no longer usable because the head band is irreparably broken.I've always liked the quality of the sound, but the price is too high for a product that physically falls to pieces in such a short time.Bottom line: Don't buy them. Look for another option. The physical quality is too poor to spend this kind of money. I'm too unimpressed by the poor quality of the Quiet Comfort 2 to ever trust Bose again with any product."
4,Good quality for a fair price,These are good headphones for the price and the noise is greatly reduced from the outside. I object only to the weight of the headphones a bit but I knew that when I bought them. What you give up in weight you gain in the great sound. I did forget to turn off the button on the side and ran the battery out so you must get used to that. These are the usual great BOSE quality so I am pleased.
2,Headset breaks and falls apart too easily,"Avoid this product. Although this headset does a great job of blocking out noise on flights, they fall apart after just 1 year of usage. The cheap plastic piece that connects the earpiece part to the part that goes over your head CRACKS and SPLITS OPEN, causing a metal piece to stick into your head, and also causing the earpiece part to fall apart. You have to tape the headphones back together using very strong tape, but good luck finding tape that is strong enough because these headphones are designed in such a way that they break through any tape in just a few weeks (because the cracking part is the same part that slides up & down, so it slides right out of the tape). Horrible quality. I expect significantly more for a $269 pair of headphones."
4,Way better than the audio-tachnicas,"I had a little melt down with my audio-tehcnica ANH-ANC7's (couldn't get into the earpiece to replace the AAA battery). So, in a huff, I went to the Bose store and bought the QC-2's. I originally bought the audio-technica's because I wasn't going to pay the money for what I wasn't sure I'd use.Well, I use them. Work in an open environment after years in a private office and noise cancelling headphones go from making sense to being a necessity.The Bose is a clearly superior product. It is more comfortable to wear and the noise cancelling feature is vastly superior.Oh, and access to the battery is easy."
2,"Too fragile, audio quality is subpar.","From my personal experience, these things seem to have the habit of breaking every 6 months. For the exceptional price, one would think they would be able to withstand 6 months of very gentle usage: no drops, no bumps... but sadly, for me this is not the case. I am on my second pair of these things (and still paying it off!) and am in the process of arranging yet another replacement. Unfortunately... the ""replacements"" they do provide are refurbished versions of other returns and are substantially less than the original ""quality"" of the returned product.I am fast losing my patience with this company and their questionable workmanship. The audio quality is average at best, quite muddy and washy.AVOID. There are better things out there for this price. And chances are, they will last longer too."
2,"Sounds great, except around cellphones","These headphones sound awesome. As long as you do not use them near: certain cellphones, wireless phones, or anything that is wireless. Some of these devices create unwanted sounds such as screeching, oscillating low beeps and other unwanted sounds. I was so disappointed when I received my official ""blowoff"" letter from bose with no resolution of the problem. But I have to admit, the sound quality (when not beeping) was unbelievable.I have noticed that some reviewers have commented on the bad noise cancelling ability, That is because the headphones have 2 settings, low and high levels of cancelling and by default they ship in the low setting. switch it to high and you won't hear much except your music. unless your near a cellphone, then you will hear beep-screeeeech-beep"
3,Not worth it,The headphones work great but after only 8 uses the ear pads fell off and the foam inside has deteriorated.Bose offered to be very nice and extend the warrantee all of another 3 months to cover but mine are older than that (not much though).For the money they charge they should not fall apart. I have a pair of Koss that are 40 years old and still perfect. No more Bose anything for me.
1,100% Bad Quality,"Good sound quality but poor design/manufacturing quality. Like many others, I've had these expensive headphones for about 2 years. The plastic is cracking on both sides of the phones. I glued one side with JB Weld and have a twist tie on the other. Fairly soon I will not be able to use them at all. I've looked for repair parts but there are none and Bose will not repair them. Stay away from these if you value your $$$$$."
2,Disappointed,"I recently went to a bose store and tried on a pair of QC2 Headphones. In the store, with the demos, I could not hear any background noise. When I got home and put them on, it was like listening to music through regular apple earbuds. For the money that they cost I would not encourage anyone to buy these. I am taking mine back this weekend."
2,Boise Quality Problem,"I really was impressed with the sound and comfort of my Boise NC headphones when I first got them. Paid about $300 which is a lot of money for headphones. After a year or so of use however the material rotted out, the plastic covering separated and the foam came apart. These were used only occasionally,like for airplane use.I called the Factory to complain about the short life and was told they were out of warranty and to bad. I'm not the only person to complain about this problem.If you don't mine replacing them every two years or so you will like them. Best to look elsewhere if money means anything to you."
1,Excellent Performance; Cheaply Built,"The sound is excellent. The construction is below poor. Mine self-broke into pieces. The plastic portion of the headphones just broke. The rubber pieces around the ears cracked and started to pill off leaving black flakes everywhere, including on myself. All of this started to happen after the one-year guaranty expired -as if it knew-. I hope Bose comes out with a better product than this fiasco."
1,"Great fidelity, Horrible quality","The sound quality is great, but the earpiece rotator that holds it together is cheap plastic that breaks easily. Granted, Bose replaces them for a year without question, but I've gone through four pair. This last pair didn't last more than a dozen uses even though it was always stored in the case between plane trips. The Bose brand should stand for something more than good sound quality. What's the point of great fidelity if they don't last long enough to use?"
1,horrible,"Bought these headphones, and a year down they start to break everywhere, the plastic is garbage STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!!!"
3,Good sound but head band easy broken,"The sound quality is good, but build quality is terrible, not worth the money. The head band is made of plastic, due their design flaw, it tend to crack and break after some use. Many users suffered this issue, search the web you can find tons of complaint, wondering why no class action against them.I have send an email to Bose customer service ask to replace the broken plastic, so far no answer from. it's over priced, low quality headphone, they spent billion dollar on advertising, but no money to improve their build quality. I think Sennheiser has the best quality and reasonable price."
2,Hurt my ears,"I bought these with high expectations. I am returning them because whatever frequency is used in the noise canceling technology actually hurt my ears. I agree with other reviewers that the cover to the battery chamber is a flimsy plastic and could break off easily. Plus, closing the battery door, which should take a nanosecond, took me awhile because the fit is so tight, you have to close it in a certain way. When I did have the headphones on, they seemed to do a very good job at blocking sound. Honestly, though, I am going back to the type of ear protectors worn by hunters, they block sound VERY WELL because they are so well padded."
2,Does not cancel enough for my expectations,"I bought these on the hope I would work much better even with my children yelling around.As many other customers, I don't give a sh..., errr, I don't care, about my computers or air conditioners humming (which are uniform and of low intensity), but I do care about people talking around me and making other disturbing noises.These headphones are ***decent*** (I expected them to be GREAT) at canceling uniform humming sounds, but DO NOT CANCEL (or even attenuate satisfactorily) human conversation/yelling frequencies.Bottom lines:- Moderately satisfied with spectrum profile, specially at low frequencies.- Very disappointed with noise canceling for ""human noise""."
2,Not worth the price.,"I'll keep this short as there are so many reviews of this product. I have owned these headphones for a few years now and during this time I have watched them slowly fall apart. While the sound quality and noise canceling ability is still excellent, the materials used in construction are clearly sub-par.- the ear pad covers are flaking off- both arms connecting the ear cups to the head piece are cracked and held together with tapeI expected much better from Bose. Keep looking."
2,Not Worth the Money,"I bought these a few years ago and used them only occassionally on flights and on the train. I found the noise cancellation qualites to be only fair. These headphones have a great reputation, but I am not sure why. I decided to keep them, and just this week, after about a total of 20 uses, the headphones fell apart. The quality is just not there. Save your money and buy something else."
5,"Comfort, Quality","First off, I purchased mine for less than half the price ($130) on eBay, so I cannot comment on the price. That said, I have owned half-a-dozen studio headphones and too many workout headphones to count. These are by far the most comfortable headphones I have ever owned, and they rival the sound of every single pair of studio headphones that I have tried. If you've got the cash, give them a shot."
1,Way over priced,"My wife bought me a pair of Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones. It sounded nice and was comfortable, BUT, it wasn't $300 nice or $300 comfortable. Additionally, I found that they would NOT work with a number of Bose amplifiers and components. They are designed primarily for use on planes. I sent them back immediately and replaced them with a pair of Panasonic headphones for 1/5th of the price and the Panasonics' are just as comfortable and good sounding. I believe that many people just tell themselves (and others') that the Bose headphones are great so that they can justify (in the own minds) spending so much for a headphone."
1,Expected more for $300,"The left side of my QC2s stopped working after about 2 years; I only use these when I'm flying so they see light usage, about once a week. I went to the local Bose store and tried a new cable but that was not the problem. The warranty is only 1 year, and the best Bose could do was to offer to charge me $100 + tax for a replacement set. I really expected more for a $300 headset. I'd rather spend about $220 and try the new Creative Aurvana's which I heard are better then the QC2s."
4,Would buy again.,"The slight pressure on your eardrums from the active noise cancelation takes some time to get used to, but it beats annoying noises. The sound quality is rather good. I have had no issue with build quality, but they ""feel"" a bit flimsy. I think if you used the case, then this should not be an issue. The headphones smelled like smoke when they came, but that faded."
2,Good noise cancelling - shoddy workmanship,"I am the owner of a now worthless original version of this headset. It was great while it lasted.Like others, mine were well taken care of and used only when traveling. After about two years they developed an annoying buzz and rattle. As they were out of warranty I did try tightening the two screw that hold the electronics in the headpiece. This had no effect.Over time the buzzing grew worse to the point where they were way more annoying than any outside noise.For the price of these units, they should have a LIFETIME warranty against any problems related to workmanship. Sure, if you smash them that should be on you but a well cared for set of this price should be an investment you only make once.I might have actually upgraded to the newer versions were it not for the quality issues. Based on posts here, these issues clearly have not been addressed."
3,"Good, but better cheaper options out there","I've owned the QC2s for nearly two years and put about 150,000 airmiles on my set. I would have highly recommended them to anyone, but now that I know about sound isolating earbuds, I laugh at the people still using the QC2 or QC3 headphones. Sound isolating earbuds like the Shure E4C are significantly cheaper (if you shop around), provide vastly better noise supression, you can easiy sleep in them on the airplane, and are nowhwere near as bulky as the QC models.My advice is to skip noise cancelling phones from anyone, and investigate noise isolation earbuds. Vastly superior in every way, and less money."
2,Disappointed,"There is no doubt that these earphones sound great, but other models from Sony for example sound just as good for alot less money. But the fact is for the price they should be durable and long lasting. They require a great deal of power, which means replacing the batteries frequently (on average every few days depending on the use). Not only that these earphones are not durable. After only a year, one of the phones has broken off. I didn't step on them or otherwise abuse them, its just that after putting them on and off so often, one finally just broke off. I called Bose but replacements cost $100 irregardless of the problem. I would imagine they take your phones and send you different ones rather than fixing yours. For $100 I could just as easily by another pair from Sony that I really believe would last longer. Personally believe I wasted my money buying these earphones."
1,High Price - Low Quality,"As others have stated, these headphones fall apart with even casual use. My wife and I both had these headphones and the head band cracked and fell apart on both of them. Bose wants to charge a high price, but they don't back it up with quality. Stay away from Bose."
4,Almost perfect,"The design, sound quality, and comfort is all there. However there are two things that annoy me.1. You must physically pull out the battery from the headphones and put them in to the charger to charge them. (Without the battery, the headphones are not operational at all). It would have been great to be able to charge the battery while wearing the headphones.2. You can't turn off the noise cancelling feature and still listen to music. The headphones has basically an on/off switch. Either you listen to music with noise cancelling on, or nothing else. It would have been nice if i could still listen to music w/out the noise cancelling (say for instance while i was charging the battery)."
4,Comfortable,"I bought these for my wife who had a nice set of in ear canal headsets. Her only complaint with those was the comfort in her ear. She loves the Bose 2's because of the comfort over her ear. For that purpose alone, these are great. I still prefer the noise isolation and sound quality from an in ear headset. I would recommened these to those that find the in ear uncomfortable but still want a good sounding headset with good noise cancelation."
4,Sound as advertised - parts problem,"Bought these 8 months ago and generally very happy. Worked as advertised. However, the foam in the ear cushion became compressed and no longer protected the ear. I took them to a Bose store simply looking to buy replacements and they gave me a whole new pair of the QC-2, and didn't even want the other in exchange. Great service, but they've got to get on this construction problem. I'm waiting for either the plastic to break, or the flimsy connector cable to fail, or the cheap battery door clip to come off."
4,Excellent ear phones...when they are working properly,"I absolutely love these ear phones and wouldn't listen to my ipod with any others. The highs and the lows are excellent, and when the family is off to sleep I'll watch a movie with these on and enjoy the sound alsmot more than the picture.the only thing is I've had to have them replaced twice in the 3 years I owned them. Each about 9 months apart and thank God the warranty was still available. I'm about a year now since the last pair was replaced and everything is good. They would just give out. Wierd but customer service is excellent."
3,"Nice headphone, but not worth the money","I have to say it is a pair of nice headphones. The noise canceling function works well, but I do not think it is worth paying extra $160 for this feature (regular Bose headphones $139/pair).In terms of audio quality, I am not an audiophile. To my ears, I cannot tell the difference between Bose and my cheap regular Sony headphones. Again, I have to admit that I am not an audiophile. If you are like me, I do not believe it is worth paying $300 for this pair of Headphones."
1,"good electronics, lousy construction,.","I will just add my voice to the others who have found these headphones flimsy. As has been described by others, in normal use the extension piece broke.Incidentally, with the original of the Comfort series, the material problems were different but equally annoying.I have purchased and tried all the top rated, and some other, brands and not had the same problems.As to comfort and noise reduction, I will leave that to the frequent flyer.I agree that each person will react differently to the kind of pressure exerted, the length of time used, the customary sound to be reduced, and, I suppose, as one reviewer put is, psychological responses."
1,"Overpriced, overrated, bleh.","REALLY muddy, overblown bass that swallows the rest of the sound. Horrible headphones, especially given their price; I've LITERALLY found ten dollar headphones that sound MUCH better than these. People who're used to crap, cheap headphones or stock earbuds will love them, but do yourself a favor and listen to some real headphones. If you want something that's closed and sound isolating with good bass response that doesn't destroy the mids and highs completely, do yourself a favor and go take a look at the AKG K81DJ. They can be had for a bit over a sixth the price of these awful things, and sound many times better. Bose as a company is all about advertising and image, not quality; once you hear some real audio equipment, you'll know."
4,Two Cannibal Movies in one!,"This two DVD movie pack is a pretty good deal for a cheap price. It has all right DVD Features like Mountain of The Cannibal God has a 13 minute interview with Director Sergio Martino, Theatrical Trailer, Poster & Still Gallery, Talent Bios. Now For Cannibal Man Does not have much DVD Features it only has Theatrical Trailer. Both movies are in Widescreen,the picture quality is pretty good and clean, the sound is pretty good. If you are into cannibal movies, pick this one up!"
5,Nice DVD products.,"The quality of the two films is pretty good and for the price is nearly a gift. Cannibal Man is a difficult movie with known Spanish actors and not boring at all and The Mountain of the Cannibal God has an original plot, a nice jungle photograph and lots of hard and savage action. A jewel not easy to imitate.Angel."
3,"A good set, yet not what I hoped for..","I recently picked up Hanzo and was a little disappointed. Glad to add it to my collection.. yet much to be desired in terms of lack of swordplay. Sure he uses 'his' sword, but don't really care much for it. On a lighter note it's a fun movie to watch and is entertaining. Do not expect a Lone Wolf and Cub similar film.. -battle scenes + sex scenes + alot of usurping from Hanzo - blood + humor + torture. I think it's a film I will probably appreciate over time. Yes, alot of spying and criminal uncovering plots.. if you watch the previews those are some of the best scenes. Fun to watch."
1,Poor Customer Service,"I have had this on order for over a month. If you look at the delivery time listed, don't believe it. My order still says 1-3 weeks from now it will be delivered.I ordered this when the item was on sale for $25.00 and I believe that might be why it has not been delivered in the time indicated. Amazon might be waiting for me to cancel the order and buy at the higher price. Classic bait and switch."
1,unmemorable,"i really struggled to enjoy this book from mcnab, i normally enjoy military fiction but this was hard to swallow, some of the factual details seemed exploited and un realistic, and i wondered if it was ghost written because of these inaccuracies? I want to recommend it, but dont, spend your money on better books out there."
5,Chinese Tea Cups,Very satisfied with the product and the delivery. Packaged to avoid any damage in shippment. The cups were even better then pictured and came before the promised date. Would buy from this supplier again.
2,Measurements?,"The measurements given were not accurate. If the raceway had actually been 1.50 inches wide as stated, that would have provided sufficient space to cover the cords behind our TV. For future shoppers, it would be much more helpful to them if given if the true measurements. When it is described as 1.50 inches in width, one would expect it to be that -- not 1.50 inches when measured around the outside of the raceway. I won't be returning the product because it will just be more cost incurred since I paid for the initial shipping to our home."
3,Looks better than the bare coaxial cable,"I wouldn't call this solution beautiful, but it was easy to install and it does look better than the bare coaxial cable."
5,"An ""Incredible"" Investment!","This book is full of wonderful web sites for all ages and interests. As the teacher for adults and teens new to the internet, I found this book to be an invaluable resource. A variety of subjects, listed alphabetically make the format very easy to follow. I want to spend my afternoons...cruising the 'net using these ""incredible"" suggestions!"
2,Brisk Grade B western with a twist.,"This ""small"" western has the unusual plot of a town marshall turning on the corrupt politicians who put him in place and equally battling them and the usual outlaws. Dix is fine in the role. Jane Wyatt is love interest. Victor Jory suave as the all too human villain. Oscar nom for Original Score."
3,A film for a Saturday matinee for kids,"It is not a B-series film, but rather a C-series film, or even something somewhat more advanced in the alphabet. But you will get the crooks and the good marshall, the rotten apple in the community, in this case the banker, and we know that from the very beginning, the calvacades and other chases in the wild landscape with many horses and quite a few casual or planned casualties, a love affair and even a sacrifice for a woman, a lot of drinking and some card-playing, and all other typical western elements. But do not ask for subtlety in this film : even the timeline is not very correct and some shortcuts are longer, quite longer, than the longcuts, but, well, we can do with that. It is funny.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
3,Don't know,"been using these for a week, hasn't killed me nor put me in the hospital which is good. However I wonder where they were manufactured, here, India, bangla Desh?????"
