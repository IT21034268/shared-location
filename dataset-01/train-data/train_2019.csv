2,Diaper Chump,"I previously owned a Diaper Genie and also didn't like the idea of buying liners and how few diapers it held. When I saw the Diaper Champ I thought it looked great. Don't let the base fool you, it is much smaller on the inside for holding disposed diapers. Also, I kept thinking my son had a dirty diaper, when in fact it was the Diaper Champ I was smelling. The Diaper Champ is residing in the garage after only 3 weeks of use, and I purchased another Diaper Genie, which I think ended up holding just as many diapers as the Diaper Champ."
2,"Stink, Stink and More Stink","I was using a Diaper Genie and it began to take on the odor of the diapers after 7 months so I purchased the Diaper Champ as its replacement. I give this product 2 stars: 1 for its large size and capacity and 1 for the ability to use standard garbage bags. Other than that it began to stink worse than the Genie after the second day. Due to the fact that the diapers just sit in the bottom of the pail without being sealed off, the pail emits an awful odor. It was the worst purchase I made."
4,Would Buy Again,"This is a fine product and I am happy with it. I clean it weekly and since my daughter is on formula now, I never put poop diapers in it and therefore it never smells bad. My favorite thing is that you can use any plastic sack store bag. My only complain is that the part that you hook the bags to doesn't connect to anything to hold it up when cleaning."
4,Works just as good as the more expensive,I bought the diaper champ because I could use my own bags and not have to spend a lot of money on replacement bags. Yes sometimes there is a smell but it is not very bad and if you keep the bag changed before it gets too full you won't have a smell problem.
5,Best purchase made!!,"We never heard anything good about the [other diaper pails], so we gave the Champ a try - out of all the items we were given and purchased, this is by far the best purchase. No odor at all! Easy to use!LOVE IT - will buy it for any moms to be!!!!"
1,Smelly champ,"We bought this champ thinking it was going to save us money from using regular plastic bags. Well we thought wrong. It is horrible. The whole room smells like dirty diapers and no matter how many times we disenfect it and wash it out with hot soapy water, it still reeks!!!! I recommend the diaper genie!!!"
2,Does not last very long,"This product worked for a while, but it doesn't last. Shortly after our daughter turned one: the outer material on the piece that covers the opening and covers the smell began to wear off; which in turn does not provide a tight seal and makes this product useless. we used the product correctly and cleaned it, and now we are forced to go buy something else. The other positive reviews that are written refer to kids well under one."
1,Still Stinky,"This thing doesn't work very well. It still smells up the room. I've found the only way to not have smelly diapers around is to throw them in a grocery bag, tie it up and put it outside. It's cheaper too."
4,Excellent!,"We bought this primarily because it had better reviews than the Diaper Genie when we bought it and that we don't have to buy special bags. I love that you can use trash bags. I haven't had a problem with the bag not being full enough. For one, when the Champ is full the trash bag is a bit more then half full, but is also very heavy so you wouldn't want anymore diapers in there anyway. The only problem I've found with it was when my sister-in-law put my 2 year old nieces diaper in there and the smell lingered a bit. Her diapers are MUCH different then my 3 month old son though. So overall I love the Diaper Champ!"
5,Worth Every Penny,"My son is a year old, and I have used the Diaper Champ from the first day home from the hospital. It is so easy to use, and the smell from even the stinkiest of diapers (and my son makes some stinkers!) goes into the champ and stays there.It is very easy to clean, and as long as you wipe it off if any poopy gets onto it, there is no smell whatsoever.Like I said, I've been using it for a year, and it has never left an odor in my son's room. It's a cinch to change the bags. A friend of mine even switched from the Diaper Genie to the Diaper Champ after having dinner at our house.If you're like me, busy with no time to mess around with messes, I highly recommend this product!"
4,Almost Perfect Product,"I chose the Diaper Champ because I did not want the additional cost of buying specialized bags that the Diaper Genie required. It's much more convienient (and cheaper) to use the same kitchen garbage bags that I already have on hand.I have not had any problems with odor and my son is now 7 months old and has been on solids for 2 months. My only complaint is that sometimes the diapers get 'stuck' in the deposit mechanism, requiring me to open the pail to push the diaper down into the bag. I think the opening should be slightly bigger to accomodate, shall we say, 'fuller' diapers!"
5,how do you use a genie???,"Well, no one in my family can figure out how to use the diaper genie. With two babies born within 3 weeks of each other, my sister in law and I decided to try the diaper champ. Her Aunt sent her the diaper genie and none of us can figure it out. The Champ is so easy!!! No expensive refills!!! We have not noticed any smells and a Wal-Mart bag can hold a lot. I would change the bag often to avoid overfilling the bag abd having diapers get stuck. Overall, this is the best baby accessory we own!!!!"
2,Go For The Diaper Genie - Learn from My Mistake!,"I didn't want to be tied into buying Diaper Genie ""special bags"" and all that. So I thought it was smarter to go with the Diaper Champ and make life simple. WRONG! We've suffered with this smelly, stinky, gross thing long enough. No matter how much you wipe it down, take it outside and hose it down, change the bags all the time, etc - it STILL STINKS! It works just fine disposing of the diaper, but the stink will drive you NUTS. The plastic seems to make the smell cling to it, and it won't go away with cleaning. Finally I bought the Diaper Genie and cannot believe I waited so long to finally give in. I wish I had saved myself all the work and effort and frustration and just have gone with the Genie from the beginning. Take my advise, don't buy the diaper champ. I wish I had listened to the other reviews earlier and gone for the Genie from the beginning!!!"
1,NOT USEFUL FOR CLOTH DIAPERS,"We bought this after reading positive reviews regarding this product and the advertising which claimed it would work with both cloth and disposable diapers. It hasn't worked well for us with cloth diapers. The diapers get stuck and you either have to push the plunger and jiggle the handle back and forth or worse, open the top and pull the diaper down into the pail (UGH). This is also unsafe while you are wrestling a baby during the dipaer change so you have to try and remember to come back and do this when the baby is changed and somewhere safe. It isn't containing smells now and is also impossible to clean well enough to remove the smell."
1,Just wait until you have it a while!,"Well, unfortunately most of the great reviews for this product were probably written a short time after having the Diaper Champ. We thought ours was fantastic when we first got it! There was no smell at all. But... now it is 5 months later, and my daughter's room reeks everytime you go in there. The smell coming from the Diaper Champ just will not go away! We cleaned it out, sprayed Lysol, etc. I think this has to be some kind of design flaw. Either after using it for a while the seal starts to leak, or after the lid opening weight sits on the smelly inside of it long enough, it begins to absorb the smell from the inside of the bag. So when you turn it over, and it's on the outside......Peeeeeeeeeeeeewww! We now have ours out in the garage, and are considering replacing this with a Diaper Genie which my sister has and loves."
4,Remember to tuck in the tabs,"We love this diaper pail, and have used it for both of our children. It does a great job blocking the smell, and best of all it uses standard kitchen garbage bags. It's very easy to use - drop in a diaper, rotate the handle and you're done.My only advice would be to make sure the tabs are folded in on the diapers being discarded. My husband has a habit of throwing everything in willy-nilly - diaper, wipe, whatever. We've had several instances of the little tabs on the diaper, or a piece of the wipe, getting stuck in the area that cycles the diaper into the trash bin. This results in the mechanism getting stuck and not being able to rotate until the block is cleared. If you fold the diaper, preferably with the wipe in it, problem solved!"
2,Short term - Good; Long term - BAD,"We purchased the Diaper Champ thinking it was way better than the Diaper Genie, especially because we could use any bags we wanted. For the first few months it was great, then it started to smell. We tried cleaning it, putting air freshners in it, emptying it more often, but nothing worked. We even called customer service thinking there was something wrong. Turns out, in order to truly contain the smell, special bags must be purchased after all.Our Diaper Champ has been in use for 13 months and in order to keep our daughter's room from smelling terribly, we must empty the pail every day - not really the reason we bought a diaper pail.BOTTOM LIKE: IT WORKS GREAT UNTIL YOU REALLY NEED A DIAPER PAIL (I.E. THE POOP REALLY STINKS)."
1,A glorified garbage can......,"I bought this Diaper Champ with my third child, after using the Diaper Genie with my first two. Some time had elapsed since my boys were babies, and I no longer had my Diaper Genie. The thought of no expensive refills, and one-handed disposal was very attractive to me, as these were the problems I encountered with my Diaper Genie. However, I never truly experienced the stench of a dirty diaper in my baby's room until I brought this glorified garpage pail into my nursery. I had spent time researching healthy all natural smell removal aids for my daughter's room, checked the AC system, everything to mask that horrible smell, which lingered all the time...until I used my brain and moved our ""Champ"" out of the ring-and into our garage. Viola! Her room smells like baby powder. And now my garage smells like a toilet. I will be buying a brand new Diaper Genie for Christmas this year!!!"
5,Far better than the Diaper Genie,"I received a used Diaper Champ and the Diaper Genie, and I have put the Genie where it belongs, the trash! I even went out and bought a second Champ to have one on each floor of our house. The Champ takes regular trash bags and unlike other reviewers, I haven't had ANY problems with the smell, and change the bags myself with ease. The base is wide and sturdy, and diapers are easily thrown away with one hand. It's perfect to be able to throw away the diaper and keep one hand on the baby. I will buy one for all of my friends who have a baby!"
2,Very nice product,"Diapers are expensive enough, so we didn't want to have to keep buying diaper pail inserts also. The Diaper Champ has worked well for us. When our daughter was infant there was NO smell. It was just awesome. As our daughter has grown bigger (and her poo smellier) we've had to take a few extra measures to keep the Champ in good shape. Like, we dump solids into the toilet (also introduces some potty concepts) before disposing of the diaper. And any particularly icky ones go straight to the outside trash. And I take it outside to air out every 2-3 weeks. But overall, its been great. I would recommend it highly."
1,From Hero to Zero,"At first we were thrilled with the Diaper Champ--when our daughter was a newborn it was a lifesaver, and there was never any odor in or around the container. We would wipe it down with Clorox Wipes and spray it with Lysol to help disinfect, and that seemed to do the trick. Then our daughter started eating solids, and, as parents know, this changed the smell of her dirty diapers. And suddenly the Diaper Champ was no longer up to the job. It didn't just smell dirty--it was RANK. This was despite frequent cleanings, changing the bags a few times a week, no longer storing soiled diapers in the thing--we'd throw those out right away and just store wet diapers. We tried sprays and smell absorbers and old fashioned elbow grease to help it smell better, but NOTHING worked. It's like the odor seeped into the plastic and wouldn't leave. We've switched to a regular old garbage pail, the kind you buy in a kitchen supply store, and that has proven FAR better, and cheaper, than the Diaper Champ."
4,"Keeps out smells pretty welll, ingenious design","I want to start by saying that there isn't a diaper pail in existence that will keep smells out of your house 100%. If you keep a diaper pail full of dirty diapers in the house and think it doesn't smell, you're fooling yourself. My review is based on keeping the diaper pail in the garage, which is what we do.I really like this diaper pail! We had the Safety 1st Easy Saver Diaper Pail and it did nothing to keep the smell out. We haven't noticed a bad smell coming from this diaper pail yet. It's great that you don't have to open the top to put a diaper in. So, the smell doesn't hit you in the face every time you dispose of a diaper. My 3 year old loves to take the baby's diapers (wrapped in a plastic bag)and throw them away because this pail is fun to use. There's just something fascinating about the way the diaper ""dissapears"". I highly recommend spending a little extra money and buying this pail!"
3,Stinky Stinky Stinky,"Well this was a great diaper pail in the beginning, but once god put smell into those little angels poops the diaper lost it's place in the house. Now we keep the pail out on the porch. Its still a good product in the sense that we dont have to buy those expensive refills and it will hold a good 4-5 days of diapers , but it would be nice to keep it inside next to the changing table where it belongs. All in all someone needs to come out with somthing better."
1,Doesn't work for dirty diapers,We bought this b/c a cousin recommended it to us. It worked okay for a few months but then it began to smell from dirty diapers. I think the seal wears out after awhile but I've never seen replacements for it. I'm having my second baby now and don't plan on getting it back out for this one b/c it was a rip off. We just keep a regular waste basket in the room for wet diapers and then another waste basket with a lid outside for dirty diapers.
1,Diaper Chump,"We have 2 children in diapers, so our diaper pail is an essential piece of equipment. We retired our Diaper Genie and moved on the Diaper Champ because it doesn't require special bags. We were very disappointed in the performance. It did absolutely nothing for odor control. You could smell diapers down the hall. My son also found it very amusing to put his toys into the Diaper Champ, as it was a little too easy to operate. We switched back to the Diaper Genie."
1,Pooper Champ,"It smells worse than a garbage truck. Every time you put a diaper into it, the smell escapes from the container (the worst part)and if you keep it in a closet, watch out! there is no mistake about what's in the container. My sister-in-law recommmended this product to me but after smelling it in her home I went with something else.P.S. She also no longer uses this product even though she still has one in diapers."
2,Kitchen trash is much better!,We chose this over the Diaper Genie because we didn't want to buy special trash bags. We wound up throwing it away after 7 months and just using the kitchen trash can (which has a lid). The diapers constantly got caught in the cylinder when we would flip it. We were always shaking and banging it to get them to drop inside. It also didn't keep the smell in very well - spraying it down with Lysol helped. We were also worried that our daughter would push it over easily because it isn't too stable. I think we'll just stick to a plain old trash can - much easier!
4,great product,"We are very happy with this product. It works great as long as you empty regularly. It uses regular kitchen trash bags, which make things really easy!"
5,Highly recommended!,"I love this diaper pail. It's very easy to use and I've had no problems with odors. I save the plastic bags my newspapers come in, as well as bread bags, used ziplocks, etc, to wrap poopy diapers in before depositing them in the pail. Diapers that are just wet go straight in."
4,No problems yet!,"I just bought the Diaper Champ last week. It's really easy to use and I am not having any smell issues yet. Right now, his diapers don't smell too bad normally, so we'll see what happens when he starts going to solids. Sometimes it doesn't completely go down when you flip it, but other than that, I really like it. I wasn't willing to get the Diaper Genie (either one), because with everything else, I don't want the added cost of special bags. With the Diaper Champ, you can use any bag, and it does exactly what it is supposed to do.Update: We are at nearly 6 months, and he has been eating solids for about 2 weeks now. Still no smell issues until you go to empty is out. It is still something I would recommend. The only other thing I might possibly see as an issue might be that it doesn't hold a lot, but if it held anymore, the bags would weigh a TON! Either way, it is still working great for me!{edit} We are now at 16 months, and it still works great for us."
2,Drum doesn't turn,"I recently bought a Diaper Champ but will have to return it because the drum doesn't turn. The blue rubber seal snags every time on the white plastic and makes you really have to use a lot of force to turn the drum over to dispose of the diaper. I'm sure not every model is defective like ours is, but it is discouraging and I'm not sure I'll get another Champ to replace this one."
2,So sick of the smell!,"While I like the fact that you can use regular trash bags, I am now on my 2nd Diaper Champ (in 9 months) and it just stinks so bad...AND, we don't even put the smelly diapers in it!! We clean it every week or so and it still has this nasty odor. I plan on ditching it and getting something else asap. Very disappointed in this product."
5,So Easy,I love this diaper pail so much!! I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER! The Diaper Champ is so easy & can be done with one hand & have never noticed a a smell. You will not regret a thing if you purchase this pail.
3,Not Impressed,"We ordered the Diaper Champ after the lid broke on our Diaper Genie. We really liked the idea of being able to use regular trash bags instead of special refills. Of course, that is wonderful but it does not outweigh the things we don't like. First off all, the opening for the dirty diapers is small and tube shaped so you have to be sure that the diaper is perfectly folded to make sure you don't get ""waste"" on it. Secondly, it does NOT keep the smell in. Ever since we got the Diaper Champ, my sons room smells like pee! We have been taking poopy diapers to outside trash immediatley and using plastic grocery bags to put pee pee diapers in before putting them in the Diaper Champ so this product has defintiley not saved us time and we are using more plastic than we used before which is what we did not want! Honeslty, we will probably sell this or give it away and buy another Diaper Genie."
2,Liked it at first....,I bought this before my daughter was born and loved it at first. It was so simple to use and seemed to keep the smell sealed away. Life was wonderful until she got her first stomach bug and the diaper champ couldn't even contain a portion of the odor. I went out and purchased a diaper genie that day (which by the way is too hard to use...get the dekor!). It was nice while it lasted (about 4 months) but now is in my attic.
4,A MUST-HAVE SHOWER GIFT,"I received a DiaperGenie for my baby shower and promptly exchanged it for a Diaper Champ, after I had done some research. I LOVE being able to use regular trash bags instead of refills, but it does occasionally release a bad odor. I changed my trash bags often, put dirty diapers in Ziploc bags, sprayed Lysol, bought a Glade plug-in:)...still smelled odors. No matter what kind of housekeeper you are, the Diaper Champ has a flip-flop top, so whenever you dispose a diaper, the bottom becomes the top and odors are released. I finally solved this problem by sprinkling a little baking soda on the bottom of the can and occasionally sprinkling a little down the top. It absorbs the odors from within and has worked wonderfully. Overall, I am very pleased with this product!!!"
1,After 11 months I'm shopping for something else,"I don't like this product. You have to step on it to flip the diaper into the pail. Sometimes the plunger thing doesn't go down all the way. The blue rubber around the hole is starting to come off, which makes it more difficult to flip it over. Many times I have to just open it up and put the diaper in, so it's basically just a glorified trash can. I'm looking for something else because I am sick and tired of wrestling with it after 11 months of use."
1,"Doesn't contain smell, blue ring fails","The plastic blue ring is constantly coming off. I wrote them, they sent me directions, I did the directions, and it didn't help. The blue ring gets so bent that it won't even fit on the diaper champ anymore. This leads to the whole thing being unable to contain the smell."
2,Just doesn't keep the stink in,I've had the diaper champ for my fist two kids and I really am not happy with it. I don't know if there is a perfect diaper pail but this one just isn't it. It doesn't keep the stink out. I don't want to change it every other day which I guess you have to do to keep the poo smell from taking over the room.What I do like is that you can use your own bags.
2,Not as good as the original,"We had the original version of the Diaper Champ for 4.5 years and 2 kids. It was getting a little smelly so I replaced it with the new and improved version. Yes, the wider opening is easier to use, but it does not contain the smell nearly as well as the old version. I used to put all diapers in it, and change it 2 times a week, for 4.5 years. With this one I can't even put the stinky diapers in it at all, they just have to go right outside. I put one stinky diaper in it, and came back to my son's room 2 hours later (he'd been asleep with the door closed) when I opened the door to his room the smell almost knocked me over. For the people with 3 month olds who rave about this diaper pail. Write again when your baby is eating solid food and let us know how you think this one does."
2,Not Easy To Use,"I've had two of these and have hated them both. An older version with a smaller hole and bought a newer one, with a larger hole, hoping it would work better. The problem is that if you toss in a wipe or two, alone, without a diaper, it doesn't allow you to pull the handle up and over. It gets stuck. I have to use my foot to anchor it and shove the handle up and over. I hate mine and am happy to sell it! I am having another baby and will be buying another brand."
3,Good product at first,"This is a good product to start and very easy to use. But as baby gets older and begins solid foods, it is not effective as an odor controlling pail. It is simply a place to put dirty diapers. My daughter is now 10 months old and we had to remove the Diaper Champ from her nursery because it smells too bad."
1,This is one stinky diaper pail!,"I have been using the Diaper Champ for over a year, and I HATE it!!! My entire upstairs stinks like diapers, and I don't know how to make this thing contain its stink (as it claims to do). It's AWFUL. I've taken to putting my son's diapers into freezer bags and sealing them up before putting them in, and I'm hoping the smell will go away. I clean the diaper pail every time I change the bag, as well, but it does not help."
1,Smelly Smelly Smelly,"We found that this product only lasted about a year before it became useless for keeping out the smell. We change it twice a week, and it still stinks up my son's room (a normal sized room). My husband takes it apart and scrubs it, still the smell comes back right away. We even bought deoderizers, etc. I got a Dekor from a friend of mine when my daughter was born, and I love it. I am going to buy 2 more Dekor's tomorrow for my son's room and the playroom!"
3,Very pleased BUT....,"For some reason, Amazon first sent us this product used...complete with poop stains! We were very disappointed but they redeemed themselves by sending us a brand new one. Now we are very happy with it."
1,Terrible and poorly made - pail gets stuck all the time!,"We tried the Diaper Champ for 3 weeks. Don't waste your money on this piece of crap plastic. The diapers were constantly getting stuck in the opening making it impossible to throw them out. First we thought it was the tape on the diapers, so we had to make sure we stuck the tape on the diapers the right way in order to make sure we could throw out the diapers, but the stupid pail still stuck. We called Baby Trend and they were absolutely unsympathetic. They said it was either the gaskets in the pail that had to be replaced (on a 3 week old pail!) or the diaper tape had to be put in place before throwing out the diaper. We went to the store and were able to return it without the box and were told that it's a pretty common problem. We got a Diaper Dekor and so far it's been super easy and worth the extra money."
3,Ok for breastfed babies,"I thought this was going to be the greatest thing EVER and it was until my son started bottle feeding and his diaper began to smell. Now, I have to bring the dirty diapers down stairs to avoid the toxic smell. Kinda makes the diaper champ usless."
5,Better than the Genie,"I started off with the Genie but quickly realized that I had to keep buying the special, pricey Genie bags. The Champ is great, takes any appropriate sized plastic bag and contains stinky diaper smells well. A MUST have!"
4,I really like it!,"I researched which diaper pail was better when i was pregnant with my first. This one seemed to have the most positive reviews so i added it to my registry. I got mine 3 1/3 years ago and i'm still using it (going on baby #3).I like the fact that you can use regular trash bags, even the cheap ones! It's very convenient to use as well. Lifting the lid can be a little tricky if you have long nails but it's not a big deal once you get used to how it works.The only thing i recommend is to make sure you wash it out and sanitize it at least twice a month because it will eventually starts to smell if not. And if you have two kids in diapers like i do, it fills up fast and I have to change the bag twice a week. With one baby i only had to change the bag once a week.It is now 2008 and i've had 2 more children (4 total) since I originally wrote this review. I am still using the same Diaper Champ and I still highly recommend it!"
3,Not the best,"While it is better than the Genie, I found this product to be a disappointment. It does not contain odors very well, not any better than a standard rubbermaid trash can that goes for about $15 cheaper. The diapers would frequently jam when you when you went to rock the handle and dispose of the diaper, smearing poop along the way. We replaced it with the Safety 1st diaper pail which is much easier to use and holds back the odor relatively well."
3,POOOOOWEEEEE,The Diaper Champ is extemely convient because it does use regular trash bags but BOY is it stinky. It does not really form a clamp around the bag to hold in the stink. Once they start eating solid food the smell is horrible. I was thinking about purchasing the Neat Disposal Pail to see if that is any better.
4,a good buy,"We started out with the Diaper Genie and weren't happy with it at all. It is hard to empty and refill, the refills get expensive, and it takes 2 hands to use. The Diaper champ was recommended by a friend, so we bought one to replace the Genie. We've been very pleased! The champ is SO easy to use 1 handed, and easy to empty and refill with a new bag. There is ""some"" odor leakage (but no more than the Genie), but as I have a 11 month old who is eating a more varied diet, it is to be expected. We've also recommended this to our friends who are expecting."
4,Grat pail!,I have used this item for 22 months and love it! I agree with another reviewer that you do not want to remove any foam piece that may come come out! I made the same error! I had gotten a diaper tab stuck and it pulled a small pice of this foam out. I then dug the rest out thinking it was a clog of paper. It still works quite well but was better before my error. I change it once a week. Since she is almost 2 now I do find that on the 5th day or so it is gettinf full and smells a little-so sometimes I empty it sooner. It is much better than other pails that my friends have! I love the easy drop in chute- it works great! This is a winner for me!
4,BE CAREFUL!,"Overall this is a smart invention - no cartridges that need replacing, easy, and you can just use a kitchen bag. It's smart. Just a warning though, make sure the diaper is very securely closed when putting it in the container. I put a dirty one in that came unraveled and got into the turning mechanism. Needless to say, it took a while to clean it and now I have leftover poo trapped in the sides. I've tried many ways to clean it with no success. I'm now tempted to just get a basic 14 dollar diaper container and just dump them more often. The lesson - simpler is better...."
1,Stainless Steel Step can Worked Better,My cousin recommended this and said it kept out the smell so I was excited to use it and then all I smelled in my daughter's room were smelly diapers. Not sure why but this plastic thing didn't work for me. Now I just use a vintage diaper pail stainless steel step can with a paper bag on the bottom to absorb the odors. I replace the paper bag every once in a while and now it's fairly odor free.
3,"Easy to use, but STINKS!","The diaper champ is definitely easy to use and very convenient since you can use any bag. However, my daughters' room smells so bad after only a few diapers are in there. I spray it with Lysol, keep stick ups in there and even put the poopy diapers in powder smelling plastic bags. Yet her room smells every other day. I too bought this so I wouldn't have to buy the refill bags but if I had to choose again, I would pick the genie."
3,Good and bad,"When we first got the Diaper Champ we really liked it. Especially since we didn't need to buy special bags for it. We have had it for almost 18 months now and the smell is horrible. We have tried bleach, comet, scrubbing and soaking and the smell just won't come out. It is so bad I am considering buying another diaper pail even though I will be potty traing soon."
2,Worked great at first,"The Diaper Champ worked great for about the first eight months. After that, it started to loose it's ability to contain the stink. We have resorted to placing the Diaper Champ on the back patio. I hope it doesn't attract any wildlife!"
2,"Convenient, but stinks!","The diaper champ is very easy to use and relatively easy to change the bags (which are regular kitchen garbage bags ... nice!), but my son's room stinks because it doesn't really get rid of any of the odor. I'm going to try something else ..."
3,"easy to use, but very stinky","The Diperchamp is easy to use, as other people have said. We bought it with our first child, but stopped using it before she turned one. It does not keep the smell in and with only one stinky diper in there my daughter's entire room would smell the moment you walked in.I really loved the diperchamp when she was a newborn and her dipers did not smell. Now that we are pregnant with our second child I am not planning on using it again because we did not use it for very long."
2,Old design,"Ok, I have not used the new & improved version but I can tell you: seek out the old version! It has been great! No expensive diaper genie bags to buy -- you can just use the plastic bags from the grocery store. On the new version, I do not see the tabs to loop the plastic bag handles over...I hope that doesn't mean you can't use them anymore!!! Also, the old version seals well and does not allow odors to leak into the room. Good luck!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITS HORRIBLE,"I HAVE A 3 MONTH OLD SON AND I OWN THE DIAPER CHAMP. THE ODOR CONTROL IS NON EXSISTANT----MY SONS ROOM STINKS. NOT ONLY THAT BUT WHEN I CHANGE THE PAIL I HAVE LITTLE BUGS IN THE BAG AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAIL, AND I CHANGE THE BAG 3 OR 4 TIMES A WEEK. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE. SAVE YOUR MONEY"
5,Deserves it's name-The Champ,"We refused to buy the Diaper Genie because of the mandatory refill bags-too much money ! The first diaper pail we had was nowhere near as good. The top opened to put the diaper in and you could see right in, ie, smell right in. My toddler could flip the lid and ended up breaking it. We bought the Champ 2 months ago and it paid for itself right away. A little hard to open until you get the hang of it, but other than that, it's great. My toddler even puts her diapers in and I never have to worry about her getting inside the pail. There is NO WAY she can open it. It's wonderful !!! I also buy the kitchen bags from the dollar store and we usually use 2 bags a week. Definitely the best !!!"
5,Awesome diaper pail!,"The only diaper pail I've found that can easily be used one-handed! Not only that, but you don't have to buy special garbage bags. You can use regular kitchen trash bags."
2,As your child grows so does the diaper odor.,I was initially attracted to this product because you can use regular garbage bags. So I registered for it. It worked fine until my son started solid foods. Then just one soiled diaper would smell up the nursery. As my son got older even the pee diapers were smelling up the nursery. I even changed the bag at least twice/week and it still smelled. My son is 2 now and I just got rid of this and bought the new and improve diaper genie which is easy to use and holds the odor in. I wish I had it sooner!
5,One hand operation - who has two hands available with a baby,"I've never tried the Diaper Genie, but from what I understand, it's a two handed operation. Most mom's know - that second hand became attached to that baby as soon as it was born, and you aren't getting it back any time soon! I can drop a diaper into the ""chute"", then flip it in with the same hand. No twisting little sausage link things together. And for Pete's sake, I do NOT have time to go running around after Diaper Genie refills. I like that I can use the same bags I use for the kitchen trash that I buy at the grocery store and don't have to make 20 extra trips a year for refills. My time is precious! And unless you're buying a year's supply of refills at once, it's time wasted that could be better spent. Not to mention the $$$. I haven't experienced any smell from this thing yet, and it's been very easy to keep clean. A great product!"
3,Bit Disappointed,"I purchased the diaper champ 10 months ago and for the first 8 months it worked well, then the foam inside that holds the odor in somehow came loose and started to hang down inside the diaper champ eventually falling away from the rim, now I have had to throw it away because the odor is terrible. I think my experience was just bad luck but thought it would be helpful for people to know that things can still go wrong with this great diaper champ"
1,Smelly,"I thought the Diaper Champ was the best thing ever...for the first 6 months. I loved it so much I bought two. Too bad after 6 months, I would go into my son's room and think he had pooped, but no..it was just the Champ. My living room one also smelled disguisting. My sister-in-law and two friends have encountered the same. We all bought them on each other's recommendations because it was easy and we did not have to buy special bags. Well, we were the suckers because we have all gone back to the Diaper Genie or the regular trash. Do not make the mistake we did. The editor mentions an order here and there but believe me, it is much more than that. It is embarassing. I have never commented on a product, but I would hate for someone else to go through this."
2,Works Great - For About 4 Months,"This diaper pail worked great - until my daughter started eating solid foods. When she was strictly breastfed her poop had no foul odor. Once her poop started to smell the smell started leaking out. She is 17 months old now and we are off to buy a Diaper Genie. Sure, it may be more complicated and a bit more expensive, but right now we are having to change the trash bag in the Diaper Champ every time she poops. It's such a smelly hassle! The entire room stinks! We're spending more on trash bags then we would on Diaper Genie bags. My advice - buy the Diaper Genie. In the long run you'll thank me."
5,A Must Have,"I absolutely love this product. When I received it as a gift, I was going to take it back because I thought it was a waste. I could not have been more wrong. My friend has the genie and says that my champ is much easier to use. Plus, I don't have to buy refills, I just use our kitchen trash bags. Removing the bag is easy and it really conceals the odors. I thought it was a little pricy, but now I see that it is well worth the money."
5,The best diaper disposer out there!,"This is a great diaper disposer because you can use it with one hand (keeping one hand on your baby) and because you can use standard kitchen garbage bags (vs. the genie which requires it's own more expensive and tougher to find bags). My advice is to wrap each diaper as tightly as you can so you can fit more in, and change it when it's full vs. trying to fit one more diaper in and causing it to jam. I think this one holds the odor in as well as any of them, but let's face it, when the baby starts eating solid foods, it's going to stink no matter which diaper pail you use. Happy changing!"
1,"Bad , bad, bad !!!","Don't waste your money... The smell is TERRIBLE everytime I open to change the plastic bag. I can also smell when drop the diaper and turn the handle. Again, don't buy this one !!!"
3,"Good idea, but a little smelly!","My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple ""flip the handle"" approach. You need to consider a couple of things before buying it, though. First, because of the fact that the diapers are not sealed into little ""sausages"" like the Diaper Genie, the Champ can produce quite a smell. Second, there seems to be a foam seal around the chute mechanism, and if you aren't careful to wrap up the sticky ends of diapers they can catch and tear this, rendering the smell worse! I haven't tried the Diaper Genie personally, but I think if I had it to do over, I might go with it and go out of my way to buy special bags just to eliminate the nasty diaper odor!"
4,"An excellent, enviro-friendly product","After reading reviews of this diaper pail and the ubiquitous Diaper Genie, we decided to go for the Champ. We've been very pleased with it. It really is odor free, no matter what's in those diapers! I love the fact that it takes regular kitchen trash bags, and that it's quick and easy to empty. My only (minor!) complaint is that the capacity of the Champ isn't as large as I'd like. Then again, with twins, I'm putting in twice as many diapers per day as the average parent. (With one baby, you can expect to empty the Champ about twice a week or so.) Also, be sure not to try to stuff too many more diapers in once the Champ is full -- you could break the ""piston"" as my over-zealous husband did with our first Champ. Bottom line, this is the only diaper pail I'd buy (twice), even with twins!"
5,It really is the champ!,"I decided to put the Diaper Champ on my baby shower registery after comparing it's reviews with those of the Diaper Genie. I have to say, I'm glad I did! Not only does it save me a fortune (I never have to buy special liners, any old bag will do), but it really does eliminate odor, even in the heat of summer. My sister-in-law, on the other hand, had a baby at the same time as me and she received a Diaper Genie. After a few uses, it is now collecting dust in her basement. Her major complaints were the expensive liners and worst of all, the horrible odor! I am so glad that I did a little research and actually got a useful diaper pail. I recommend Diaper Champ to anyone looking for a diaper pail that actually works."
3,Only lasted so long,"I got the Diaper Champ when my baby was born and loved it. The problem was that after about 10 months it started to smell. I washed it down with bleach, but not long after that the smell came back. In my opinion the smell either permiated the plastic or a seal was broken. So I replace it with another one. Now it's 16 months and this one is starting to smell. I'm going to try the Diaper Dekor next.(Update) A month later with the Diaper Dekor and I miss my Diaper Champ. The Diaper Dekor does not hold in smells at all!!!"
5,LOVE the Diaper Champ!!!,"The Diaper Champ is so much better than the Diaper Genie. I can't believe we waited so long to get it (or register for it in this case). With our son we used the Diaper Genie (wide mouth), and it worked fine, but it was always a pain to empty, and to buy the refills all the time. You know they make the money off of the recurring costs of those refills and not the Genie itself. But the Diaper Champ, while it costs a little more, is so worth every penny! You can use regular supermarket plastic bags in it, it's so easy to empty, and I haven't had any problems with smells from this product. It's even fun to put the diaper in the top, flip the handle and have it disappear. It's almost a little toy for us! (I know, that's weird - but it really is a cool little mechanism). I highly recommend this product!"
5,Worth the extra money!,We were going to buy a cheaper model but then decided to go with this one. Well let me tell you it was worth it! This is a great product. It can be used with one hand which is convient when you are holding your child and does not smell. It also uses regular garbage bags which is much less expensive then those stupid cartridges. The only time you will smell anything with this product is when you empty it.
3,Better then a trash can.,"When my wife and I got the Diaper Champ, we thought that it would work perfectly. We read the reviews on and saw that people liked it much better then the Diaper Genie, but I'm not 100% sure. We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used. We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only. We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped. This eventually ruined the foam pad that is applied to the flip top to keep odors in. I had to go and pull the crumpled foam out just so we could turn the lid. But like I stated, its better then a trash can, but I'm not sure if its better then the Diaper Genie."
2,The charm has worn off,"When I initially started using the Diaper Champ, I loved it. It definitely has advantages over the Diaper Genie* no special bags or inserts to purchase* much easier to empty* difficult for curious kids to openThe down side?* after a few months of use, IT STINKS!! I have used Lysol liquid and spray, Odo-Ban and Totally Toddler without success. I have tried different brands of bags (including scented)without success -- the room smellsI used my diaper Genie for almost 3 years and can honestly say I never had an odor problem -- just a running out of bag problem periodically. After 9 months using the Diaper Champ, I put it to the curb with the garbage this morning and am going to purchase a Diaper Genie."
2,"The Champ is down for the count, and so are we! Phewy!","TKO... for us! I'm with Deb from Cleveland! I loved the idea of this diaper disposal when I got it. You don't have to use 'their' bags, which really cuts down on expenses, compaired to other diaper disposal systems. HOWEVER, when our baby started eating baby food, and the poops became BIG STINKIES, clear the room. This pail does NOT keep the stink in! I have sprayed, I have about 5 stick-ups in the pail...nothing works. I have owned this disposal for 8 months, but it is time for it to go."
4,A must buy...,"This product is just what the nose wanted, and what your pocket can afford. My wife and I chose this product becouse of the reletively great reviews on Amazon.com and because there was no need to buy special bags (both inconvienient and costly). I was delighted how the Diaper Champ controlled odors (only an occational excaped odor). Because of the large size, we (rather, I) had to empty the Champ only twice a week when our son was under six months. Further, the Diaper Champ was easy to sanatize and clean. I highly recommend this diaper disposal system to all moms and dads who are looking for an economical and odor free diaper container."
2,Disappointed,"After reading good reviews on this, we went ahead and purchased it. However, our baby is 2 months old and we have already quit using it.Pros: No cartridge to change, no special bagsCons: It was difficult to open in order to empty, The top that flips back and forth gets poop on it (which our dog proceeded to lick off - yuck!), Our diapers would get stuck and then the top wouldn't flip back and forth (we are using cloth though, but supposedly this is supposed to work with cloth).Instead we are switching to just a regular kitchen trash can (a nice enamel one that you step on a pedal to open). So far there has not been a problem with odor and we can use it as a trash can later."
3,"After baby starts eating real food, it stinks!!","The diaper champ was wonderful for the first 5 months of parenting. Once my son started eating ""real"" food (and I am talking only baby veggies such as sweet potatoes, green beans, etc.) the diaper champ doesn't do a lick of good. The smell permeates from the bin, throughout his room, and even into the hall! We used to only change the bag twice a week, now we seem to change it twice a day! The reason I give it three stars is because at least I don't have to buy expensive refills, I can just use cheap costco garbage bags. Friends have said they found the same thing happen with the diaper genie, too. Guess the solution is to just put the diaper directly into the outdoor trash bin!"
2,Disappointed,"We bought the Diaper Champ because you could use regular trash bags with it, which is a great feature. At first we had no problem with smells; however, now that our daughter is six months old and eating solid foods, the smells have become an issue (and I do change the bag every 3 days and wrap the diapers up with the tabs) and are not contained with the Diaper Champ. We keep it upstairs in her room, so it's not like many ""soiled"" diapers even go in there, but when they do, her whole room smells every time you turn the handle. We recently went away for the weekend and I soaked the whole thing in bleach, thinking that would help, but a couple of days later, the smell is back. For our next baby I will try the ""new and improved"" Diaper Genie and hope we can use it longer than six months. This one is being taken out of her room."
2,"It's nice, but it sure does stink!","I bought the Diaper CHamp because the old diaper pail broke. I read some of the online reviews and decided to give it a try. It works well and uses regular trash bags - no need for expensive bags. My only problem with it is that it really does STINK!! I had to take it out of the baby's room. I am constantly spraying Lysol on it and Oust around it trying to remove the smell from the room. And I just changed the bag yesterday! I am seriously thinking of going and buying something else, or potty training early!"
1,Five fingers with no nails,"I have to agree with the other moms. At first the Diaper Champ was a champ, until I had to change the bag. It is difficult to open, not to mention everytime I did change the bag my nails would break (and I don't have long ones). My daughter is 19 months, still breast feeding and eating solids and let me tell you, her pooh stinks. Once I decided to take the Diaper Champ out of the room and walk each diaper to the outside dumpster, it still took weeks for the smell to get out of the room. It penetrated into the room. Not to mention, one day, little tiny flies started growing inside. I was changing the bag on an every day basis. This is by far the worst product out there. Take my word for it when I say, I rather take the walk and dump the diaper outside than have to use the Diaper Champ ever again."
4,Good Buy,"I think this is a good buy. I like that you can use regular bags. Mine does smell sometimes, but that is my cue that it is full. It does let you know when it's full by getting stuck. Assembly is easy. The only thing I don't like is that I almost always break a nail when I try to open it."
3,"Works well, but still smells.","We bought the diaper champ, because we heard all the others where over priced, espeically with the refills. We liked how with the this diaper pail you could just use regular trash bags. It worked very well and we where very happy with our purchase until it started to get warmer out, and our son started to eat foods. It smells! We keep it in our son's closet with an air freshiner in it! It's good while they are young, right now i think any trash can would do the same."
2,Diaper Champ Blues,"I have to say I'm very disappointed in the Diaper Champ. I agree it's easy to use, but the first dirty diaper and the whole room stinks. Isn't one of the big reasons you have it is to keep the room smelling fairly good? We have the air freshner that goes with it, a second air freshner and odor guard bags and it still stinks! This is our first baby so I have not tried any other product yet, but I would NOT recommend this one!"
3,Not great for stinky poops!,"While my daughter (now 10 months) was breastfed this diaper champ was a champ but now that she's on solids and teething.... oh nelly! Now I'm in the position of searching for a better, as in ""not so stinky"", diaper pail. Even with regular trash (odor absorbing) bag changes and liberal use if Lysol, nothing has helped the stench. We had hoped to keep it throughout the diaper changing process, but now we are forced to look for something else."
2,Great if your kid doesn't poop,"I bought the diaper champ because of the convenience of using regular garbage bags with it. It was great when my son was little and only doing breastmilk poop. But, once we started on solid foods and things got stinkier, so did the diaper champ. The whole bedroom stinks if you put a poopy diaper in the diaper champ. We still use it, but only for wet diapers. However, it is still better than the diaper genie which is completely useless!"
3,Great until toddlerhood!,"I used the Diaper Champ until my daughter was about 15 months old. When she was about 1 and her diapers got really smelly, it just couldn't contain the odor any longer. I tried spraying with Lysol, bleaching it, soaking it, putting baking soda in it, air fresheners, leaving it outside overnight...nothing got the smell out. I switched to the Diaper Genie with the toddler refills. I really liked the Champ for the first 15 mos., though. Easy to empty, use your own bags, etc.One small drawback is the loud ""thunk"" it makes when you drop the diaper into the well and flip it over. Could potentially wake a light sleeper."
3,"Good product, but less useful for bigger cloth diapers","We opted for this pail since we are cloth diapering, and the product works for cloth diapers. My son is nearly a year old, and we have found that the Diaper Champ, emptied 2-3 times per week and cleaned regularly, is very good at containing odors. As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing. Because of this, we've moved from the Diaper Champ to a wetbag on a hook-it works better for cloth and takes up less space."
1,Diaper Chump not Champ,"My husband and I purchased this on our own (no shower to help us out) because we thought it would be easier to use than the Diaper Genie. We quickly learned that althought the Diaper Chump is very easy to use, it STINKS, literally. We had to move it to another room less used by people. I have since thrown out the Diaper Chump after a very long 4 months and bought a Diaper Genie which actually is very easy to use. Don't buy this under any circumstances, unless your baby doesn't make stinky diapers!"
4,This is a great product!!!,"The diaper champ is very simple and easy to use. It keeps the smell out. Unlike other diaper pales, you are able to use regular household garbage bags. It holds quite a bit of diapers, only needing to be changed every 4 days or o, with a newborn. I would definately recommend it to anyone!"
1,Smelly and not worth using,"I just bought this today because I was tired of buying refills for my Diaper Genie II, especially on a tight budget. After using it for just 4 diapers, I packed it back up and am bringing it back to the store for a refund.Each time I flipped the handle and the piston moved, it gave off a huge waft of diaper smell. And the smell lingered and it was all I could smell in the room. Not ideal for a diaper pail.And when the piston is down it leaves a large hole where you put the diaper. But my 3-year old thought this would be a great place to put her toys. Yuck!I will stick with my Diaper Genie II. I've been using it with regular trash bags with it and it still works better at containing the odor than the diaper champ did with just 4 diapers."
2,"Good for newborns, awful for toddlers","This is a good concept, easy to use, no special bags etc. BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie. ALso, watch out for the smell. I feel like the plastic has permanenely absorbed the poop odor and no amount of cleaning or bleaching can get it out. I'm expecting another baby and don't plan on using it."
4,Highly recommended!,"After we tossed out the worthless Diaper Genie, we bought a Diaper Champ. It's a world of difference. This uses any trash bag, so you don't have to buy a proprietary bag pack. You just put the dirty diaper in the top, grab the handle, and flip the top over. Works great. There's only only little problem--if you toss wipes in the top, they can (and often do) get stuck in the mechanism and jam it up. I see some of the other reviewers noted this as well. We just stick the wipe inside the diaper when we toss it in, and then close up the diaper with the velcro. We almost never get a jam this way, and it helps keep the smell down when you change bags. I strongly recommend the Diaper Champ."
1,Stinky Stinky Poo,"I used the Diaper Genie for 4 years and had no problems with odor. After 4 years and 2 kids it was starting to fall apart, so I decided to buy a diaper champ. I liked the idea that I didn't have to buy the refills or worry about the twist and changing etc.. But, the trade off has not been good! My Diaper champ does not hold odor. I change the bag 1-2 times per week, but my child's room still stinks every time I enter. I use Clorox wipes to clean it and Lysol spray. I would not recommend this product to a friend."
1,Those with good reviews haven't used this long!,"It started out ok, but the ring that seals the rotating drum catches as you try to actuate the handle. It gets so bad that the product hardly works. Baby Trend claims that it is an assembly issue and provides directions to take it apart to fix it, but that doesn't work. It's the outside of the ring that gets hung up. Baby Trend will not provide replacemdnt parts after 6 months and even then only with a reciept. If you don't want to buy refills, get yourself a garbage can and empty it often."
1,Don't Buy this Diaper Pail,"We originally were going to buy the Diaper Dekor, with its own special refill bags, but then changed our minds and bought the Diaper Champ instead, as it could use regular kitchen garbage bags...BIG MISTAKE!!!!! when you turn the handle to dispose of the diaper into the pail, the wipes from the previous turn, are often stuck inside, so when you turn the handle, the wipes pop out onto the floor! we are now going back to our original plan of buying the Diaper Dekor, despite the fact that you have to buy special refill bags"
4,As Good As It Gets,The Diaper Champ worked absolutely perfectly for the first several months. When my son hit 6 or 7 months the odor took over his room. The company has been great about trying to help us - they send free gaskets as the old ones come off - and they have even offered to send us a new lid since the new gaskets haven't helped. From my experience this diaper pail is about as good as it gets - but after a while it's no longer perfect.
3,"Economically good, but a little smelly","For the first few months, especially with breastfeeding, I had no almost no problems with the Diaper Champ, but now that the diapers have gotten stinkier, I am definitely smelling it ouside the container. It goes away after a while, but it sticks around longer than I'd like. And I have ripped off more nails than I care to remember trying to open the top to change the bag. Other than that, this is a great product, purchased primarily to avoid buying future diaper refills."
1,Don't buy it,"I used the diaper champ when my son was about 18 months old. It does not keep odor out, sometimes diaper gets stuck, making a big mess! After awhile it smell even when empty... I prefer using the DG, it's more sanitary and really does the job"
2,It depends on how much you use it,"When I was home for the first 8 weeks it seem'd ok. It was when I went back to work that it didn't work. It's ok when you change the bag alot. It fills up pretty quickly so it's not too bad. Now that she's in day care full time, I don't fill it up fast enough and the room would smell like diapers. so I used it for the first 8 weeks and now not at all. If I were to do it again, I would just buy the disposable garbage bags they sell for the diaper bags and just put them in my regular trash. That is what I do now and have no problems with smells. Munchkin sells awesome bags for dirty diapers, they come in a little duck for your diaper bag. Those are awesome!!!"
4,A better product than the Diaper Genie,"This diaper pail far excededs the Diaper Genie. There is no worrying about running out of refills. The bags are so easy to change. The pail can get a little smelly, but some lysol and the odor guard trash bags help a lot. Overall, a much more convenient and less expensive product than the Diaper Genie."
1,"WORLD CHAMPION "" CHUMP""","After reading how great this product was on the convenience of not having to but those expensive bags ( diaper genie) I registered for the diaper champ. What a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. The smell is HORRIFYING!!!! Needless to say I am now going to buy the diaper genie and those expensive bags. I shoudn't have the gag reflex every time I enter my daughters nursery. I strongly recommend that you DON""T buy the diaper CHUMP......"
1,fundamental design flaw,"it was relatively odorless for a few months, but now at 9 months it stinks (literally). maybe we got a defective one, but it seems to me like a fundamental design flaw that the area where the flippy wheel sits is lined with foam rubber. dirty wipes get jammed in there, in direct contact with the foam rubber, which of course absorbs whatever is on the wipe. so you're stuck with an ineradicable stink. i've tried taking it apart and scrubbing it, which works for a day or two. i suppose i could have avoided the problem by never putting in loose wipes, but then what is the point of having this product?"
2,"If you want to keep your fingers attached, don't buy this!","My husband and I are returning this product. We bought it because it didn't need special bags. However, the blue handle is very difficult to open - we tried several times and each time each of us tried to open it we got our fingers pinched!"
1,Nothing but a bucket!,Why spend money on a bucket when every house as one. This was the worst investment I have ever made. If I would have known what I now today I would not have wasted my money and would have went for the real deal. Please do not make the same mistake as I. Go for the Neat.
2,Can i use this for cloth diapers?,i am wondering if anyone can tell me if this would be ok to use with cloth diapers.i am a cloth diaper mom and i am having a hard time finding a cloth diaper pail.out of all the ones i seen this one looks like it might do the job.btw i only rated so low cause i never used it LOL[...]
1,Never got the one I REALLY wanted,"Placed the order within the time limit I had before the baby shower....the mother-to-be wanted the pink one. I was notified 5 days before the party that they didn't have it in stock and they wanted me to order the white one intstead. When I palced the original ordered, the pink was in stock. Talk about blotching an order!! *grr*The product arrived AFTER the party. I was not pleased.When and if the opportunity shall rise again to get this fabulous product....I'll go to Babies-R-Us instead of Baby Age! >:("
1,"The ""diaper champ"" CLOGGED!","As the mother of an obese child who has a great affinity for all things edible, I felt great relief when the ""Diaper Champ"" arrived on my front doorstep. Removing it from the box, I felt as if I were in a dream! It was so new...so clean...so glimmering white! I hustled it upstairs and set it up next to Jane-Bob(my baby girl)'s changing table. I didn't have to wait long before I was provided with a fresh offering. I bundled up the heavily laden diaper and hauled it into the Diaper Champ. Alas! With a great roar, the Diaper Champ clogged and sprayed back at me. It took me weeks to clean that room...Don't get it! It clogs! And when it does, you'll be sorry!Quaddie, your friendly advisor!"
1,Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ arrived to my old address, even after I changed the ""ship to"" address on the amazon.com website. I had wanted it shipped to my work address.It finally arrived, in horrible condition. It had been opened, and was thrown on my porch. It is a good thing it didn't rain, or it would have been ruined.I was very unhappy with the website for not picking my the address change, and also with the unacceptable delivery."
4,pretty good considering,"PROS: one handle flip great, easy to clean, smell stays in until you open the garbage can, installing bag easy and don't need to buy any bagsCONS: need to find big bags or needs to change garbage frequently."
3,"Easy to use, but still smells","I agree with all of those who said this product is easy to use, it is. It is also very good at keeping little hands out of the dirty diapers.What I have found though is that when a stinky diaper is deposited, the room smells until I change the bag out. One thing that I have done is when I am going to deposit a poopy diaper is to place an empty plastic bag into the tube area, put the diaper in it, and then tie that bag off before turning the champ handle, thus adding another layer of stink prevention. It isn't perfect, but it helps. I like the idea of trying scented garbage bags, so may give that a whirl too.I wanted to write a review so that people don't buy this and think that it solves ALL of their diaper problems. I think the stink still exists, but other than that it is a decent product.Good luck."
5,Works Great!,"The Diaper Champ has performed beautifully so far for us - my daughter is 14 weeks old, and we have been very pleased with the ease of use and lack of odor. Especially nice is the fact that no special refills are needed, which not only saves money but is more convenient. We just use the same drawstring trash bags that we use in our kitchen, which can be bought in bulk quantities."
2,Disappointed,"After reading all the reveiws here, I bought the diaper champ thinking it was a great deal. I liked that I could use any type of bag with it and not have to hunt down the genie bags. It does inhibit the odor from escaping the pail however there is one major downfall with this item. Opening it.I have broken off three nails on my right hand trying to get this thing open. The latch is hard to open because basically you have to use the tips of your fingers to disengage it which is tricky. If you have nice nails and prefer to keep them, I suggest getting a different pail."
5,Good Choice,We selected this item because it does not require special refill. We have been using it for a month and love it. It's easy to use and seals very well. You can use regular trash bags or even plastic grocery bags. My husband said it was a little hard to open the top when he empties it but I guess that's why it seals well.
5,Great Diaper Pail,This diaper pail is excellent. No odors have escaped the pail in 3 months. I am very pleased with it. I do have one word of caution: Make sure there are absolutley no diaper tape edges hanging loose when you flip the cylinder. They can rip out the filter that keeps the odors inside. Baby Trend will expect you to send the pail and the original receipt back to them for repairs if the filter comes out. I found that to be a joke since I got this as a gift for my shower (no receipt) and the repair would take six weeks (how I'll never know why). Fortunately Babies R Us will allow you to exchange the damaged item if it has been 90 days or less. Save yourself aggravation and make sure everything that goes down is bundled up neatly.
4,Better than the Rest!,"I have the diaper champ and an 8 month old baby - I love both! ha ha - seriously it uses any bag (read: the safeway shopping bags, kitchen garbage bags etc) - we found some scented bags (which hide any smell when you go to change the bag) and they fit perfectly and are about $1.29 for 30. I hated the diaper genie and it's expensive refils, you have to push the dirty diaper thru the hole with your hand - not here - the diaper champ allows you to stick the diaper in a hole and turn the handle.The only downside if there is one - is the opening/ closing mechanism on this is sometimes a bit tricky, but well worth all the other positive features! I recommend registering for this!"
5,genie can give you three of these...,"I gave away my genie and bought one of these. This is so much easier and smells less. Yes, it does give odors but come on your dealing with poop. A friend suggested a car freshner of baby powder.. I haven't tried it yet but the odor is so much better than those stinky bags that you have to buy for the genie. The odor doesn't bother me... this is an easy CHEAPER product.. using regular bags is so much easier.. my husband loves the two way swivle.. so you don't have to use so much of your attention away from your child..."
3,Easy to use!,"This is easy to use, but it does not disguise the smell that great! I did like that you can use any kind of bag with it."
4,Works great for us,"We've used this for my daughter for the past 2 1/2 years now, and I think it's great. I love that I can just use regular garbage bags, plastic grocery bags, Target bags, or basically anything bag-like! I have even used the plastic bags the UPS guy uses to deliver boxes in when it's raining outside! In most cases, the Diaper Champ kept the smell inside (close your nose when you open it to dump it though!). There were times when it got smelly, but I think those were times when I had forgotten to empty it in a while. We kept it in the bathroom at first and now it's in my daughter's room, and it's worked well. It's slender enough to fit snugly between the wall and the changing table (which we now use as her bookcase). I also love that she is able to put her own pull-ups in and turn the handle by herself, so she feels independent in that regard. I think this is a great product!"
4,Very easy to use and odor free while closed,"Pretty stinky when its time to change the bag though and its difficult to get the top up to get TO the bag to change it. Otherwise its one hand use is convienent and while closed, no odor. I would recommend it."
4,Keeps the smell contained-major bonus!,It's amazing how well this diaper pail keeps in the odor. My husband and I didn't realize it until we opened it up to take out the bag. Love this product..a must!!
5,"A must have for twins, trips, other multiples and 2 under 2","We had the genie for our first child, and we thought it was pretty good. However, the special refills were annoying to buy and keep on-hand... and changing it was difficult.The Diaper Champ is a real champ. The wide mouth accepts those nasty smelling incoming diapers and with a flip of the handle, they're gone. We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners. If you have 2 under 2, those smelly toddler diapers can go right in with the baby's... and you won't need a gas mask, even if you don't empty it for a day or two."
3,Almost a Diaper CHUMP,"I'm not one to write negative reviews without including positives. This diaper champ is good because it doesn't require the use of particular liners -- regular kitchen trash bags work great. And I really can't complain about the smell. If it starts to smell, it's our laziness for not emptying it when we should have. I have twin boys so I have one upstairs in their bedroom and one near our make-shift changing table in the den.Would I buy one for someone expecting a baby? NO. Diapers get stuck and jammed and the two side ""knobs"" fall off.We still use it because I'm not going out to buy another. But it's not a contraption I'd recommend. I have no advice as to which ones are better, as I've only used this one. I liked the ease of using our own trash bags and not having the expense or inconvenience of purchasing particular liners."
2,Diaper Pail Pain,"I researched ths diaper pails and actually returned the one I already received due to the ratings of the Diaper Champ. Though it does use regular trash bags, I use scented bags as it does not ""twist"" the diapers and I am trying to reduce any odor when I open the pail. The ""easy to open"" feature is diffucult to open and usually snaps so hard I hurt my fingers . The smell is minimal as my child is still a newborn and I do use scented garbage bags, I can only guess that as my child gets older and the diapers get more ""smelly"" I may be in trouble with odor control! The garbage bag does insert easily but doesn't lock in the system anyway to seem secure. I think if I had a chance to change diaper pails I would have gone with another Diaper pail."
2,Does this really trap odors?,"After reading the other reviews, I honestly think that I must have a bad designed diaper champ. After about 2 diapers, the odor comes through which causes the entire room to smell bad. I must admit that the convience of the one hand handle is a great idea, however, after about 8 to 10 diapers, you can forget about the ease of the handle because it tends to get stuck. All in all, this diaper champ does not hold odors any better than my garbage can."
4,"This Product is a True ""Champ!""","My husband and I originally registered for the Diaper Genie, but we changed our minds when we considered that we would only be able to use the Diaper Genie refills. The Diaper Champ allows you to use regular garbage bags. Plus it's simple to use. We haven't had a problem with odor at all. It's a great product!"
1,Hate Them All!,"It stinks - we lysol ours 2-3 times a week. Diapers get jammed and it hardly holds any. We are better off buying a flip garbage can lid for like $6 bucks. Same idea without the headache and the ""diaper pail"" look.The only good thing with this one is you can use any garbage bag you want."
3,I'm not so sure a diaper pail is that handy...,"After using this diaper pail for 6 months, I'm rethinking the need for it. I hate emptying the stinky thing every 3 days or so. The kitchen trash gets emptied almost daily. It is really no trouble to change baby, then scoop him up and carry him and soiled diaper to the kitchen to dispose of the diaper."
1,This pail stinks!,After reading all the good reviews on this pail I went out and bought it. I'm soooo disappointed! IT STINKS so bad...it doesn't hold the odour what so ever!
2,It Smells,"I have been through the Diaper Genie, the Safety 1st diaper pail, and this one. I've liked this one the least. The diaper genie worked the longest for keeping odors away -about 9-10 months.(I washed it with bleach once and it was never the same after that). But it was annoying to have to buy the refill bags. So we bought the Safety 1st pail next. That lasted about 4-5 months and the spring broke. I've had the diaper champ for about 8 months. One good dirty diaper and the room smells, even if you flip the handle twice. I've tried putting baking soda on the bottom and have tried the odor eating garbage bags and neither idea has helped with the odors. I also found that this one is the hardest to clean (especially the cylinder).My daughter also likes to flip the handle-and if that cylinder is not sitting right...the stench is awful. Truthfully I have found that none of these systems work 100%. I'm about ready to use my kitchen pail (at least the garbage is thrown out every day)."
2,OH THE SMELL!!!!,"We bought this 3 years ago for my son when he was born in an effort to avoid the more expensive Diaper Champ and to avoid having to buy special bags for it. This was a mistake. After my son started eating solid foods, the smell was horrible! Despite keeping Lysol nearby, my husband and I were always arguing over who would take the bag out when it was full. Several times I took it outside and cleaned it with clorox to get rid of the smell, but it only returned. We're now expecting again, and this time we're going with the Diaper Genie!"
1,Hold your breath on this one!,"We were former diaper genie fans until after about 8 mos of usage it was nearly impossible to change out the refill containers. It seemed that the ring on the inside had worn down, and the refill wouldn't fit. We became frustrated and went immediately to the store and purchased this diaper champ. I so wished I had read the reviews on this product prior to my purchase. I loved the fact that you could drop the diaper in the small opening and it immediately vanished to the inside of the pail. However, the smells remained, causing our son's room to reek of waste. No matter how many times we changed the bags, the smell never went away. Nice concept, but a total waste of money. We ended up going back and buying another diaper genie. The one star I gave it is for the neat way you drop the diapers into the pail."
1,this STINKS,"The diaper champ is only a champ when you have wet diapers or are breastfeeding (poop doesn't stink). It doesn't hide odors, so it's only as good as a garbage can. Wish I had not gotten it."
2,"Great at first, but just wait!!","We bought the diaper champ because you could use your own bags and didn't have to buy the expensive refills. At first it was great. The only time we smelled something was when it was time to change the bag. Once my son started on solids I started smelling it more. So I changed the bag more frequently. That worked for a while, but now nothing works. I took the champ outside cleaned it with clorox clean up, sprayed it with lysol and left it open outside for two days. As soon as the first poopy diaper went in, the smell returned. We are on the look out for a new one. Don't waste your money!!!"
4,Great and no odor here,"Great iteam,no odor ,I keep it in the babys room no bad smell you could use regular trash bags no necessary needs to buy special ones.A friend gave it to us cause his baby dont need it and still work as new...I was thinking to buy it at first when i saw it at the store..."
3,mixed feelings,i bought this for my now 6 month old son and its very easy to use- you dont have to get any special bags or anything. (sometimes if my husband doesnt wrap up the diapers well they get caught in the hole but i guess thats more his fault than the diaper champ!) it doesn't hide the dirty diaper smell though! we have it in his room which is very small as it is and you can really smell everything. i tried using odor neutralizing garbage bags and those bags that are scented and nothing works. i even tried wrapping the diapers in those skinny bags that come with your sunday newspaper and then throwing them out and it still smells. kind of disappointed--
1,Actually like the old style better,"With my daughter wearing larger diapers, I thought that the wider opening would be easier. But its not. Everytime we flip it over it gets stuck and wipes for some reason always fall out. Its not fun cleaning up poopy wipes off the floor!"
1,NEW MODEL IS BAD - Please Read,"Two years ago we bought the diaper champ because we thought it looked like it would keep the odor down and didn't require refills - and we loved it. After two years it had absorbed enough odor that we wanted to replace it so we bought a new one. They changed their design and their ""new and improved"" diaper champ stinks the whole house up after less than a month!Stay away from this - they've ruined their own product!"
3,Help - cloth diaper question,"To those that use the Champ for cloth, do you still use garbage bags? Do you have any liquid in the bag for soaking?I have heard this pail is terrific and plan to use it, but I am concerned how I will soak my diapers without fear of the bag busting when I carry it to the laundry.Any feedback would be helpful."
2,DIAPER NANNY BY COSCO BETTER,BUY THE DIAPER NANNY INSTEAD....HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS YET.....FRESH AIR AT LAST......
1,Wouldn't recommend ot- smelled up the room,"I purchased this after seeing it at a show for new baby items. With a 2 year old that wasn't yet potty-trained and another on the way, I wanted a diaper disposal system in each of my boys' rooms. I had this one in my two-year old's room and it was horrible. I thought that not having to purchase separate bags would be wonderful. I even bought those garbage bags with the odor removal in them and it still didn't work. My sons' room smelled terrible after about a week. No amount of cleaning the unit helped. At least with the Diaper Genie, you seal off the bag and there is a seal when you close the lid. Not with this system. It is easier to use, but the smell is awful. You might as well just put the diaper in a pail and remove it daily. Or, if you want, I've got a perfectly good one sitting in my basement and you can have it for free."
1,ODOR ODOR ODOR,"This product is awful. It does not hold odors at all. I have read in other reviews about how you have to constantly clean and use disinfectant, etc. Why wouldn't I just use a covered trashcan then? The whole purpose of this is to keep odors out of the house. My wife, who recently had our second child, was overcome with the smell during her second pregnancy, to the point where she never put a poopy diaper in the Diaper Champ. We have another diaper dispoal system for our new baby (forgive me for forgetting the name), and it works great."
1,Worst product out there!,We bought this because it was recommended by Consumer Reports and I certainly regret it! It only holds about 10 newborn diapers before it becomes clogged and stops working. Its probably better to stick with the Diaper Genie.
2,Too Expensive!!!,I paid $39.99 for this on Amazon and could have bought it in the store for $29.99. WAY too overpriced! I wish I had researched a little more.
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this on Saturday because I was dissatisfied with the Diaper Genie. By Monday, I wanted it out of my house. While it is easy to use, it does not hold odors at all. My daughter is 14 months old -- maybe it would work for a little baby, but if you have a toddler, don't bother!"
5,Very good item,My daughter is 2 and half months old and I have been very pleased with the diaper champ. As with anything that you stick trash in once it is full there may be a slight odor. I put a little bit of baking soda in the bottom of mine to help eliminate any odor. I only notice an odor when its full. I then empty it and that remedies the problem. I really like that you can use a houshold trash bag with the diaper champ. It alleviates countless trips to buy a specialized item. I would buy another one and recommend it to anyone.
2,not that impressed,"My son is now 11months old, and this is the only diaper pail I have had, but I would definetly try something else for my next child.The good things about this diaper pail are the price, and it is easy to use and change the bags. It doesn't require any special bags which is cost efficent.The thing I can't stand about it and the reason I only gave it 2 stars is because of the smell. My childs room always smells like I just changed his diaper. I use scented bags in the diaper pail, I have a deoderizer stuck on the inside of the pail, and I have an odor neutralizer on the outside of the pail. It still smells, so I would not recommend this product."
4,If the Aroma matters.,"Its a good product because its easy to use, and you don't need the expensive refillable bags like the Diaper Genie. However, it doesn't do so good of a job hiding the smell. We'd spray the inside with Lysol disenfectant, but if we waited for the bag to fill up to capacity our room would be full of the dirty diaper smell. So that's the only reason I give it a 4 stars.Its easy to use, and inexpensive when it comes to the refills. Just doesn't mask the smell of dirty diapers that well."
2,"Not a ""champ"" in preventing smells","We've used both the Diaper Champ and the Diaper Genie, and if you are buying a diaper pail to keep out smells, the Diaper Champ is not the best choice! While it's relatively easy to use, if the smell factor is what you want to avoid, go with the Diaper Genie model with the ""wide mouth"" instead. We have a 3 year old resisting potty training, and one on the way in just a few weeks. We've invested in a second Diaper genie and thrown out our Diaper Champ - it just doesn't do as advertised!"
2,This really didn't work for us,"I thought this was a great idea, but in practice - it really didn't work well for us. The diapers would get stuck in the 'piston' and the odor was not well contained. If I could go back, I'd register for a Diaper Genie instead."
1,Stinks,The diaper champ has had to be put in my laundry room. It stinks to high heaven. A very disappointing item. I would definitely NOT recommend it.
2,STINKY!!!!,"I don't think I would have bought the diaper champ if I heard how bad it smelled! I read all great reviews but I guess people must have left out how bad it stinks all the time. It does not keep odor out at all. I have scented trash bags in it and it still gags me when I walk in my daughters room. I think the way to open it is awfully hard too. I brake a nail every time or pinch my fingers. I don't think I would reccommend this to anyone. It helps save money because you don't have to buy special bags but for the extra money I would have gotten the diaper genie. Unfortunatly, I found this out too late!!"
3,Good but Not great!,The diaper champ could be a little better. My husband and I just had our first child and wanted something that would cut down on smell *which it does and when we noticed that it used any bag we were sold. . . it wasn't until a couple days after our daughter was home that we noticed a problem . . . a major jam!!! If you don't tightly fold the diapers they will jam and it's more of a pain to deal with then any smell. . . I don't need to have my hands in any more diapers then I already am dealing with ya know what I mean?!? I hope it works as my daughter gets bigger =) I do like the product expect for the jams and the loud noise
4,AWESOME PRODUCT-- only a little stinky,"I originally received the Genie for a shower gift and didn't know of the ""the champ"" until I saw it at a girlfriend's house... How easy!? and no extra cost for bags! Perfect. The ONLY drawback is the occasional smell which we've remedied by individually bagging the poopy diapers. There is a great item at Bed Bath and Beyond that holds grocery bags for you... so, we purchased one of those, mounted it to our wall next to the diaper champ and we're set! Seriously, it holds more than the genie and it is sooo cost effective. Not to mention, just plain easier!"
4,Love hate relationship,"I love this diaper pail cause you can use any bag with it even those little plastic grocery bags. And its easy to use one-handed, don't have to bend over too far to use it either. And its really cool how it works... But we keep this in an area of the house we do not visit often cause it still STINKS. We now only put dirty diapers in this pail and keep it behind a closed door. Plain wet diapers go in our kitchen trash can (has a lid).Wish someone could tell me how to fix this to keep it odor-free as it indicates. I even now use potpourri scented trash bags in it and THAT doesn't help much."
5,Its easy to use - even one handed!,"This diaper pail is great. No expensive refill bags to buy, it uses any kitchen trash bag. No smell and its easy to use - even one handed! It is worth the money!"
1,Diaper Champ not a Champ!,"We bought this item a little more than a year ago. It is not odorless, it is hard to change, and not the greatest product ever. I would not recommend it. WE have our changing table in our living room, where the kids are most of the time, and the reek got so bad, that we ended up putting it outside, I am sure to never bring in again. Contrary to other posters suggestions, we do change it about every other day, and the reek is so bad. Even after spraying febreze, or glade neutralizer in it... I have cleaned it with clorox wipes, sprinkled baking soda in it, and it still reeks. Go with something else."
3,Skip it,"I have a two month old. I've tried both the Diaper Champ and the Diaper Genie for two months now.Bottom line:If cost is important to you...get the Diaper ChampIf smell is important to you...get the Diaper GenieThe design of the Diaper Champ does not prevent smell as well as the Diaper Genie PERIOD.If you see a review here that touts that the Diaper Champ doesn't smell, then laugh at them. They probably have a dog and think that it and their house don't smell because of the dog either.YES, the Diaper Genie costs more over the life because of their bags. SO WHAT."
1,Vile,I've used the Diaper Champ since my son was born. After about 4 months I can only describe the smell coming from the Diaper Champ as VILE. I have almost thrown up while changing the bag. We've tried everything we can to clean it. I've soaked it in bleach and sprayed every inch with lysol. Today was one of the best days I've had with the Diaper Champ--we put it in the trash!
1,Diaper Genie A Much Better Product,"We bought the Diaper Genie and the Diaper Champ - we are much happier with the Diaper Genie. The film cartridges are a little bit more expensive, but they keep the smell away unlike the Diaper Champ."
4,Great Dumpster,"Great Dumpster for baby's dump (toxic waste). But sometimes diaper wipes get stuck. Also if it seems like the handle won't turn, it's definitely time to change the bag. The only time you need to hold your breath is when you take the bag out. But other than that, it doesn't stink up the baby's room."
4,A real winner in our nursery,"In reading some of the other reviews, I think it's all been said but I guess I'll say it again anyway. :) I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes. My husband and I tend to let it get to the point that we have to actually push the plunger down to get the diaper to go in and still the nursery is odor-free for playing or sleeping. And I must admit, I have a 1 yr. old who eats everything under the sun and even when it comes time to change the bag, it's not that bad. Tie it up fast and you're good to go. ;) I will admit that it can be hard to open, but if it were easier, I'd have dirty diapers strung from one end of the room to the other because of my busy boy!!! I highly recommend the Diaper Champ!"
5,Knocks the competition off it's feet!,"I love the Diaper Champ! My room is also my son's room, so it was important to have a diaper disposal system that kept nasty smells locked away. I thought about getting the Diaper Genie, but I didn't like the idea of having to buy expensive bags or using so much effort to dispose of the diaper. With the Diaper Champ, I simply roll up the diaper as small as possible, drop it in the hole, and flip the lever. I know when it's time to change the bag when it starts getting difficult to flip the lever. Couldn't be simpler!"
1,The Diaper CHUMP!!!,"Worst diaper pale ever!! I've had mine for 2 years now and I am throwing it away as soon as my second Decor arrives. No matter how many times I clean the ""Chump"" it still stinks. The diapers and wipes get caught in the drop hole and stuck wet wipes make it stink even worse. Forget scented trash bags, they won't cure the smell of the ""Chump"". Also, watch out when changing the bag, you may lose a finger if the lid unexpectedly slams shut on you when changing it. Forget this pale and go for the Decor."
1,It STINKS...literally.,"The Diaper Champ is TERRIBLE at keeping the smelly diapers from only smelling in the container. Our baby's room was constantly stinky (due to the Diaper Champ, not the baby!), and we were having to empty the container almost daily. What's the point of having a diaper disposal system if you can't dispose of diapers efficiently? Please don't buy this product unless you enjoy smelling those dirty diapers. The Diaper Champ just doesn't work."
4,Diaper Champ / Saves money,My wife and I looked at the size of the Diaper Genie and realized that it was much smaller then the Champ. In addition we didn't want the extra cost of purchsing specially made diaper pail liners. With the champ we can purchase the bulk garbage bag liners at Costco for th Champ refills. The only slight Negative is the lid release. It is at times difficult to open. But other then this we are quite satisfied.
3,"easy and convenient, but pretty smelly","Like many others, I registered for the Champ because it was so easy to use and didn't require special bags. I have been happy with it for those reasons, but the inability to seal in smells has left me disappointed. My baby is only 7 weeks old, therefore not on solid food and the smell that is leaking from the Champ leaves me wondering what will happen when she is eating solid food. I don't know how the Genie or the other diaper pails do with the smells, so I can't compare, but I think this is pretty bad. When the weather gets hot and humid I think that I might end up switching to another pail. Also, when opening the Champ, be careful not to break off your nails. Since having my baby, I have given up on having well manicured nails, but I'd rather not have ragged nails, either."
1,Diaper Champ lost the race,"I decided to try the diaper champ after having my third child. It was not a winner. First of all, it began to smell once my child was introduced to solid foods. The baby's entire room had an odor and it took days for it to go away. Secondly, the dirty diaper would get stuck when I would turn the handle for the diaper to go down into the pail and would cause a mess! I used the diaper genie with my first two children and would recommend that over the diaper champ."
4,Pretty good smell control..sometimes get's stuck,This is a decent diaper pail; it does well on smell control and hold a lot of diapers but occasionally a wipe or diaper tab will get stuck in the mechanism and you have to try and fish it out. Overall I think this is a good product.
5,the champ,"I work at a store that sells Diaper genies, and they are ALWAYS being returned due to people unable to use them, they were so complicated. So I knew I did not want that. I went with the diaper champ and I love it! So easy to use, I can use kitchen bags that I already have as liners and no odor!! I can't belive some of the negative reviews. Our daughter is 14 months old and we have used this since day one. To the reviewer who said wipes get stuck...WRAP THEM IN THE DIRTY DIAPER. You should do that no matter what diaper system you have. I wouldn't trade this for any other system!!!"
3,Barely lasted 10 months,"We opted to register for this diaper pail because it didn't require costly refills. It seemed to work well at first, although the changing of bags was a bit of a pain. By the time my son was 8 months old, the pail began to stink a lot. We always wiped it down and sprayed it with Lysol. Eventually, a piece of foam from inside (I'm guessing this helped to keep the smells inside) came loose. We finally had to throw it out when my son was 9 1/2 months old. My neighber who had a baby at the same time also owned the Champ and had to toss her's out when her daughter was 5 months old. The same thing happened to her.We are now expecting our second child and are in the process of buying a new pail - probably the Neat System."
5,Good product,"six months in -- Well designed. Have had no smell problems. Ability to use regular trash bags is huge bonus. Would buy this item again without hesitation.Update -- Nine months in and have to say that this is not doing a great job of keeping smells in -- the champ has been ko'd. Worked really well though for the first eight months or so. Based on those eight months of use I would still recommend as it is easy to use and the ability to use normal trash bags is nice. Good product, but be mindful of its limitations."
5,EXCELLENT CHOICE!,"We have been using this for about 6 months now for our baby girl. This is better than some of the other ones we have tried since some use too much bags and others are too complicated one handed. You also use your own garbage bags, not some over priced special ones.This one is great!! One hand to drop the diaper in and then flip the handle. If you think it has a smell, drop in one dryer sheet and you won't notice anything!We really recommend it!!"
2,Smelly Diapers,"I registered for this product after reading the reviews, and I have to say I was very disappointed. You are better off just getting a garbage pail with a tight lid. Not only did my daughter's room smell horrible, but I broke three finger nails trying to lift the lid."
2,What is that smell?!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this product based on reviews in ""Baby Bargains"" and also on this site. At first it worked well- no major problems. It smelled when you opened it to change the bag- but what container storing dirty diapers wouldn't? After about 2 months of use, the smell got bad. I had been changing the bag frequently, cleaning it, airing it out outside, and finishing that routine with Lysol. However I could smell the thing in the hall outside of my daughter's bedroom. I changed the bag, cleaned it, etc (see my usual routine above) and it still smelled. It wasn't even open!To make an even longer story shorter- I bought the Diaper Genie and found that all of the ""reasons"" that I didn't buy it in the first place (refills being costly/annoying) didn't even apply to me. The refills are about $5 and are available at all of the stores that I go to on a regular basis. I've used it for about 2 months now and I can't smell anything, unless I'm emptying it and the bottom is open."
3,Good at first then stinks,"I got this diaper pail as a shower gift, cause thats what I wanted. It works good, for holding a lot of diapers. But after some time it starts to smell. I have used sprays, deoderizers, air freshners, etc., it takes care of the smell for a couple hours, then it comes back. I have taken it outside and washed it out and then let it air dry, but that still didn't work. I still use it, and just put up with the smell. So I don't know if I would recommend it or not."
4,Smart buy for stinky business,"We bought this because of the ease of using regular garbage bags and not being slaves to buying specific refills. It is very easy to dispose of the diaper and to change the bag when full. As your baby does get older and onto table food, we have definately noticed an increased, ahem, odor. We now keep it in the garage and take the stinkies out there. Our little boy's room was smelly when we would open the door to get him up for the day. You can make it last a little longer if you cheat and put the urine diapers in the regular trash if it is changed frequently enough. This works for us because we don't go to the nursery changing table--we just flip him over on the living room floor now!"
2,THE ORIGINAL WAS *MUCH* BETTER!,"I hate to say it, but the improvements made to this product actually made it WORSE! The original was wonderful -- lasted forever, worked great, ABSOLUTELY NO SMELL... the only bad thing was the mechanism to open it was difficult. We had the original for over a year with no smell at all. Then we decided to get the upgraded and improved one and were SO disappointed! It started to smell almost immediately and only got worse. I'm sorry to say, we should have stuck to the original. Maybe the company will hear enough complaints to go back to the old one! In the mean time, we're looking for a different product."
2,"New ""improved"" version smells bad!","I absolutely loved the older version, it did a great job of containing odors for about 15 months. It started to smell and cleaning didn't fix the problem so we replaced it with the new version of the diaper champ. I'm so disappointed. When you put a diaper in and flip it, all the stinky air comes flying out and it's horrible. The larger opening is nice but it certainly isn't as airtight as the older model. I'd keep looking for a better diaper pail rather than buy the new diaper champ."
2,I'd rather buy refills...,"... than deal with the odor from this pail. Even changing the whole bag (we tried plastic grocery sacks, tall kitchen bags, even heavy duty garbage bags) every day didn't help. We've moved this product to the garage and purchased a Diaper Genie for the nursery."
3,Stinky and Germy,"I got the Diaper Champ because I had friends who had the Diaper Genie and it always seemed so difficult to use. I would go to change my daughters diaper at their house and wouldn't be able to figure out how to put the diaper in it. I liked the Diaper Champ because you could use regular trash bags instead of refills, which saves a lot of money. But, my daughter's room always stinks horribly. I'm also a nursery coordinator at my church, and because the Champ doesn't close on top, the kids would stick their hands in it and we would have to shoo them away and wash their hands. I just bought the new Diaper Genie II because I am hoping that it will eliminate the smell. If you don't mind the stench get the Champ, but I almost think it's worth the few extra bucks to buy refills for the Genie and not have a room that smells like poop."
2,worked...at first,"I am really disappointed with the Diaper Champ. It worked great at first, but then the foam seal broke and it wouldn't contain the smell. Babies 'R Us gratiously exchanged it for another one and it happened again. I would say it's a product default. We always made sure the tape was tucked in, etc., but the foam liner just kept coming out. Plus, sometimes when the diaper was really heavy and big, like in the morning when they're soaked, it wouldn't fit in the chamber and turn properly, so we'd have to jam it in there, gross!Otherwise, the champ worked well on odors and accepting diapers. I'm pregnant with baby #2 and will look into other diaper pails."
4,"excellent, but.....","I bought this with my first born for the same reason as everyone else listed. I didn't want to be committed to one type of bag that is more pricey than their worth. It was great! Held back the smell and there wasn't a continuous cost buying refills.The draw back came when after some time the foam seal that keeps the odor in where you deposit the diaper finally gave way and slid out of place making the whole thing rather useless. I am not sure if it was just mine or if it was a manufacture flaw. Also, it was three years ago so maybe that isn't a problem anymore.I am contemplating trying it again for my second child because again, I don't want to have to buy special bags.-Sarah"
5,"Not just another ""gadgety"" baby product!","This is another great baby purchase. When I brought it home, my husband laughed at me and said that it was just a ""gadgety"" baby thing that we didn't need. He changed his mind though after we put it into use and saw how well it worked!First, it really keeps the odor in. I'm pretty sensitive to smells, but this one does a good job of containing odors. Just to play it safe though, I make sure to empty it every day and a half to two days or so (you could probaby go longer), and I spray it with Lysol as well. Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain. Its nice to be able to use regular garbage bags and not having to buy expensive diaper disposal system specific bags.No bad odors and not expensive to buy or maintain---I definitely recommend this product!"
2,This diaper pail stinks,"I registered for this pail after reading so many positive reviews on Amazon for it. It is very easy to use, but my baby's room stinks from this daiper pail. I sometimes wash it but that doesn't help either."
3,Worked for a while... moving on now,"I was quite pleased with this for the first 6 months. Now as my son's diet is changing, the odor of his bowl movements can no longer be contained. We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain. There is one serious design flaw though - the pail is tapered such that the bottom is noticeably larger than the top (probably for balancing purposes). The problem is if the diaper bag gets too full it makes it really hard to pull out the diapers.Pros:- cheaper than alternatives- worked great the first 6 months- was able to use normal garbage bagsCons:- smells after 6 months- bad tapered design makes it hard to remove diapers"
2,Frustrating,"I've used one for disposable and then one for cloth diapers.The Good:1. It does contain odor well if you change the bag every two days or so. 2. It does not require special bags. 3. You can use with cloth diapers (in theory.)The Bad: 1. Impractical for Cloth diapers because you have to change them out far too often into another bag. No diaper service wants to pick up 7 bags! Cloth diapers are just too bulky for the champ. 2. Far too tempting a toy for a toddler. 3. Hard to clean the hole you put the diaper into which can become smeared with poop on a bad day.The Very Ugly and Frustrating: ***Wipes Jam it! It's easy to say ""tuck the wipe into the diaper"" but with babies and toddlers you can't always plan things so smoothly. The champ becomes jammedmultiple times a day from a lose wipe or one just not tucked into a disposable diaper well enough. It's truly maddening and the main reason I gave it only 2 stars."
1,"Stinks,Stinks,Stinks!!!","We had this Diaper Pail in our laundry room and it always stunk, especially when you turned the handle. We would have to change it every day. We now have the Diaper Decor and love it. With a 18 month old and a baby on the way I have found the perfect diaper pail. Don't buy this one it was a waste of money. Hope this helps."
2,Very Stinky,"I found the Diaper Champ to be VERY smelly. Not only did odors leak out, but when you take out the bag you are assualted by STANK. Just like when you take out a regular garbage bag, you have to pull up on the bag with it still open and the smell is awful. I much prefer my Diaper Genie II."
2,Not such a champ!,"I don't review products unless I think they're really great or a waste of money. The Diaper Champ is a waste of your money. While not having to buy refills for it and being able to use trash or plastic shopping bags is convenient, that's the only pro of this pail. It's okay in the beginning when your baby is on breast milk/formula and not much else. But once they start eating and really pooping, not only do you deal with odors every time you change the bag, you deal with them EVERY time you add a diaper to the pail. When you pull the handle to dispose of the dirty diaper the scents of everything inside come floating out. My son's room constantly smelled of dirty diapers. I bought the Diaper Genie II when my son turned a year old and I'll never use anything else again. The refills hold a lot of diapers and there is NO ODOR EVER!"
2,Stinky!!,"My hubby and I have had both the genie and the champ (one upstairs, one down). The champ really stunk up the room. Each time you flip the lid, odor came out! and when you opened it to take out the bag, oh man!! The genie doesn't completly hold odor in either, but I don't see how any dispsal system could. However, the genie was better at holding the smell better than this thing. The only good thing (and I mean the only), was that it took regular trash bags. Other than that, you would need a nose plug!"
5,Great Item,"We purchased the Diaper Champ instead of the Diaper Genie because we didn't want to buy special bags. We have now used it for a year and it has been great! We can use our regular garbage bags so the cost is very minimal and we don't have to worry about going out and buying those special bags like for the Diaper Genie.We use cloth diapers and it works really well for that. We change the bag almost daily, as we have two in diapers and cloth diapers are bulkier. When it gets hard to turn, it is time to change the bag!The Diaper champ really minimizes the odor and is very easy to clean up, we just wipe it with a soapy cloth and sometimes spray a little disinfectant to help with the smell.This is great and I would recommend it for everyone."
3,"Easy to use, but smelly!!","We bought this because we needed a first floor diaper pail. And the Diaper Genie was a bit hard to use, so we tried this one. While this is very easy to use (one-handed), after 36-48 hours, it smells really bad!! So we have to change the bag in it very frequently. Oh well, I'd still recommend it. You just may have to buy stock in air fresheners as well. And we even bag our smelly diapers before putting them in."
3,Diaper Champ Stinks After 6 Months,"My Diaper Champ started out great, completely odorless & easy to use. Now, six months down the road it really, really stinks. I had to completely remove it from my daughters room and move it outside.I have tried changing the bags more frequently, washing it down with bleach, I even stuck an air freshener in the bottom of it and nothing helps.I have no experience with any other type of diaper pail but I am very disappointed in The Diaper Champ. For the retail price...it should really last a lot longer than six months!!!"
3,Diaper pail isn't a champ,"Love the fact this pail can use regular garbage bags. However, diapers get stuck frequently and you then have to take off the lid to deal with it. Kind of a pain."
4,Wonderful pictures and very informative,"Widmer and Wang give a wonderful taste of contemporary film and fiction in this book, which would look good on any coffee table or bookshelf of any film connoisseur. It is also a good insight into the art of film in Communist China. Through it, you gain a better understanding of life and hardship in such a volatile period in China's history through the eye of a lens."
2,"Funny, but not great for impressionable young readers","I love Robert Munsch and my kids have read almost every one of his books. I returned this one, though, after a few reads. It is funny and silly, like every Munsch book. But I just didn't feel comfortable reading a book that says ""fart"" all over the place. If you talk like that in front of your kids, well then you will like the book.My kids repeat everything that is in these books, and this just reinforced the idea that speaking crassly is funny. The book could have been a lot better if the language was made more appropriate for a 3-year old. The impact could have been just as strong by saying ""toot"", or even by coming up with lots of creative alternatives.Instead of this one, some of Munsch's better books are Boo!, Stephanie's Ponytail, Kiss Me I'm Perfect, We Share Everything, Mmmm Cookies, The Paperbag Princess. All of these are also hilarious and I have no problem with my kids repeating the language word for word."
2,Ewwwww,"When I bought this book, I knew it was used. I did not know they were going to send it to me with there dinner on it. Maybe next time they could clean it up or just put it in the trash. Great book if it was cleaned off."
4,Say what? Good families do!,"This book was a hit in our classroom. I think the adults were more taken back than anything. I heard our foster grandparent say 'Did she just say what I thought she did?' I replied, 'You sure did'. This brings out our bodily functions in a humorous way. May sure you play-up the part of the monster. Enjoy!"
5,If you need a laugh...,Has there ever been a sibling who didn't think gas was hilarious? Sometimes only-children think they have the only family with gas - set their minds at ease! Pair it with Beano for a nice gift to your brother.
2,"OK, I hate to be a stick in the mud, but......","I bought this book because I love Robert Munsch's book I Love You Forever. I knew what I was ordering so it's my own fault, but I can't use this book. It's stuck up in my closet and I've never given it to the kids. I have a 6 year old and a 3 year old boy, and I have enough trouble with them talking about things that I'd rather they didn't, so I don't know why I ordered this book. I know they'd think it was funny, but the last thing I really want to do is get them talking about farts all day. I'm sorry, if your kids are more mature I'm sure it would be fine for them. But it definitely wasn't for my family."
3,Good Families Don't,"This was a funny book, not one of Munsch best, but full of laughs. There's very few books that actually talk about ""Farts"", well this is one of them."
3,if you don't like frozen food/microwaves...,"then this may not be the book for you. although the recipes are varied and interesting, there's a lot of reliance on ""pre-prepared"" ingredients. also, i found the tone of the writing somewhat condescending and off-putting. the author writes fairly insistently about the ""right way"" to approach her recipes. i bought this because the reviews here were so glowing, but it has been sitting on my shelf gathering dust for months."
5,Enticing Recipes,"Anderson's book was a revelation to me! I was already an enthusiastic buyer of all the time-saving, quick-fixing, pre-chopped/sliced/diced/julienned convenience foods available -- but DINNER IN A DISH/DASH showed me (for the first time) how to make the most and best of them. The recipes are enticing, and the tips on buying, storing, and pre-cooking are priceless. I also like the writing style -- breezy, confident, and clear. Couldn't wait to try the Pacific Rim chicken salad, and my family loved it."
5,I Don't Know What I Did Without It!,"I commute to work and am away from home from 7 in the morning until 7 at night. When I finally get to my kitchen I'm not feeling very creative and it is way past time for dinner to be on the table. I just love Dinner In A Dish and A Dash and use it almost every evening. You can just check to see what you have on hand and always find something delicious in this resourceful book to put together fast. I love all of Jean Anderson's books and this one is surely right on for today. My copy is already starting to look kitchen worn, used and loved. I would recommend it for anyone who thinks they are too busy to serve great dinners in a hurry."
2,Wasn't what I expected,I was expecting a book with many ideas to use in my classroom and was disappointed when many of the activities are all alike. I would not recommend this book to others.
3,In the Mix-Underground for real,"I was one of the Artists on the Comp put together by Brooklyn Music. As far as comps go, this one has some strange beats on it as I remember and really not that cheesy. I think producers and fans alike would love to check this stuff out. Good to see some truly underground productions on sites like amazon. Pretty amazing."
4,Dark and creepy ... in a good way,"Trip Hop creates a journey for me every time I listen to it, and I'm sober. It's got a good mix of slow and fast songs that are adequately blended together, one after the other, for a complete album feel. It starts out with a strong beat, gradually makes its way to a much slower, trippy dub by the time you hit Khromazomes, then reverses course and heads for a spacey feel with Old School Succession by Invisible Man. Once you've hit that track, it gets a little dicey from there in terms of slow and fast, but the songs are quality... and the experience of Daddy's walk is especially creepy--like some kind of bad dream that you can't escape from, like the swamp in Dagobah where Yoda lived. The last track was a pretty weak ending, but overall, this album's well worth the money."
5,VERY UNIQUE CD,THIS CD HAS SOME GREAT SONGS ON IT. SOME VERY DARK AND STRANGE BEATS. LIKE NOTHING I'VE EVER HEARD. DEFINITLY WORTH THE MONEY.
4,Great content but problems in publishing,"Highly informative for doctoral students but a bit of a pain to read because there are missing punctuation marks and letters. The publisher really needs to do their homework before putting something like this out. In spite of the problems, still worth it for the price."
2,A real disappointment...,"I had high hopes for this one, in preparation for teaching a course on research methods. I found the discussion entirely too abstract -- odd, given Becker's insistence that he would use examples to illustrate his points. There are some intriguing discussions, but much of what I found was not terribly useful."
3,"This is a tribute album, not a greatest hits package...","A tribute to Arnaldo Baptista of Os Mutantes, recorded mostly by some rather obscure Brazilian indie rockers. Some tracks are really interesting, others less so. Mainly draws on Baptista's solo work, rather than Mutantes-era material."
5,An Excellent Guide to the L.A. Acting World,"I recently moved to Los Angeles to further my acting career. Mr. Lewis' book was one of many I read on the subject prior to my move and was the only one that I've really followed since I've been here (6 whole months now!). It sounds kinda' ""cheesy"", but I followed his advice pretty much to the letter and am well on my way. It was a tremendous help in getting an agent and just ""learning the ropes"". I highly recommend this book to all newcomers to L.A. and any actor who is still struggling trying to figure out this town! Break a leg!"
3,O.K. but clearly for people with no experience,"Hi - this book is great for someone who has almost no experience. If you have been acting for any period of time at all, you will know most of what is in the book. Not to mention, some of the information is a little outdated. But that being said, it does have good info. in it for those just stepping into the business."
2,Outdated!,"Although this book has good information for someone starting out in Hollywood, it is VERY outdated and anyone reading it definately needs to read newer books on the same topic (and there are plenty of them!)."
5,Excellent reference source for HRD professionals,"This is a great resource for HR professionals from tiny to mega corporations. Contributing authors are the most respected experts in their fields. Primary focus is on training and development: accountability, justifying programs, format, leadership, pros, cons, pitfalls, challenges . . . all aspects are covered.As I research and write my Adult Education thesis, this book is the most useful tool I've found."
1,Woody Drops The Ball!,"June 7th and still no textbook.Class is over in four weeks.Will the book make it before the last class? Magic Eight Ball says: ""Highly Unlikely"". Will I ever deal with woody's again? (Other than to collect my refund)Magic Eight Ball says: ""Not a chance"""
4,Deals With the Devil (?),Cabell's mythology encompasses fantastic levels in language elegant and cunning. The History of Dom Manuel continues through his descendant who finds peculiar solutions to difficult situations.
4,This is what Heavy Metal 2 should have been!,"Namely, a showcase of a great mix of animation styles - CGI and Cel blend into a story of intrigue and monsters - and the archetypal beast-hunter. Really - add more music and it could have been a segment of (lighters out please) Heavy Metal. That's the only shortcoming... it could have been a bit longer."
3,Blood the Last Vampire,"During the Vietnam War, US government officials hunt and kill mysterious vampiric creatures. They enlist the aid of Saya, a young swordswoman who herself is a vampire, ""the last remaining of her kind"", to help them hunt and destroy these creatures before they pose a major threat not just to the populace of a local village, but the whole outside world. Though lacking in much of a backstory concerning Sayas origins, how she came to be recruited by the American agents, etc, the movie itself is very well produced and very stylish, although at 48 minutes, i truly wanted more. Why just 48 minutes????? But, if you enjoy good anime, and I picked this up out of curiosity, Its worth checking."
4,"Worth a look, and yet not","This review is little difficult because I don't know what I can say that already hasn't been said. Like anyone else will tell you, unless you've seen the anime series ""Blood+"", your going to be lost. Because the setting in this show takes place in a time that is vital in the Blood+ series (just before the big incident in the Vietnam War). That's where the first three stars come in, for placing the main character ""Saya"" at a place and time in the Blood+ timeline. I give it an extra star for the fact that the ending is left open for imagination on the viewers part and left open for discussion over subjects such as philosophy, and existentialism."
4,Bloody Good Time!,"This is one of the most stylized and artistic anime films I've ever seen. What other reviews have described as a lack of plot I thought gave the film an independent feel. The animation and characterization are both remarkable (the director creates full, interesting characters in a very short amount of time). This one definitely isn't for kids, but I'd highly recommend it for any adult that wants a quality scare!"
3,"Good, artistic, but not great...","There was absolutely no storyline or plot worth noting, but that doesn't stop this from being spectacular at least as far as aesthetic quality is concerned. A big Mamoru Oshii fan, I was deeply disappointed and thought this film could have been... well, an actual film, instead this movie seems to be a short film with the sole intention of trying to start a series in hopes of further explaining the storyline.Again though, the movie was seemingly done for artistic purposes only and in that regard I rate it the way I do. However, if you find this character interesting, I urge you to try Kite the Uncensored Version - a much better story, more interesting character with great traditional animation (whereas this featured quite a bit of CG masked in).All around, pretty interesting at the least!"
4,Vampric Anime,"There's some pretty bad vampire anime out there and there's some very good...and then there's this movie.The original voice acting is good, the animation is fine, the look of the characters is....different. I liked it, but I realize that not everyone does. I love how uh, BAMF, the main character Saya is. She kicks vampire-butt and takes names. She has a super cool sword. She is emotionless and jaded.This movie is not the best, in terms of anime, vampire anime, or the ""series."" I _love_ the TV series and the different mangas are at least interesting. I do think I would have been jaded and not liked this movie as much if I had seen the it after the TV series. But it is a good movie and I certainly don't feel like I wasted my time."
1,I can't speak Japanese,"The CGI graphics are wonderful but no one tells you before you rent the movie that more than half of it is in Japanese and there are no subtitles. I became lost as to what was really going on. My advice, if you want to see it buy a copy on dvd so you get subtitles."
3,IS IT REALLY SO GOOD?,"I HAD SEEN THIS MOVIE FOR SEVERAL MONTH AGO, BUT I DO NOT THINK THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE. EVENTHOUGH THE CG AND 2D ANIMATION SKILL CAN COMBINE ALMOST PERFECTLY, BUT I THINK THE STORY IS TOO POOR. I THINK THE SKILL THEY USE IS THE FUTURE PROCESS OF ANIMATION WORLD, BECAUSE CG CAN NOT REPLACE ALL 2D ANIMATION. BUT I THINK THIS SKILL IS NOT THE LASTET SKILL. THIS MOVIE JUST MAKE THOSE TWO ELEMENTS LOOK BETTER. THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. BECAUSE OF THE POOR STORY, THIS MOVIE CAN NOT MAKE VIEWER SEE THIS MOVIE SECDOND TIMES........THAT IS WHY I ONLY GAVE THIS MOVIE 3 STAR."
3,IS IT GOOD ENOUGH?,"I HAD SEEN THIS MOVIE FOR SEVERAL MONTH AGO, BUT I DO NOT THINK THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE.

BECAUSE OF THE POOR STORY, THIS MOVIE CAN NOT MAKE VIEWER SEE THIS MOVIE SECOND TIMES,THAT IS WHY I ONLY GAVE THIS MOVIE 3 STAR."
2,Not enough,"I purchased this DVD with high expectations, however it turned out to be only a forty minute feature. No character development, no answers. This feature had the story line and beautiful animation to become a Anime classic, instead its nothing more than a disappointment."
4,A Small Taste of Blood,"DVD is an excellant format to showcase the ""digital"" animation technique used in Blood. If you like this style, and by all means you should as the animation is excellant, check out Blue Submarine No. 6. As for the story for blood its typical of anime that winds its way to America, it seems we're missing forstory and the ending of the story. What we're left with is a violent slice of a compelling story I hope we'll be able to eventually see more of. The DVD is well done and the extras are great. This would be 5 stars except for the short length of the feature."
2,ctc22anime,Top of the line animation. The only anime that comes close to this type of work is Blue Submarine 6. But there is a hugh difference which is what stop this anime from being a good one and that is s story line and character development. This anime left too many questions unanswered. But if you want to take a look at the future of anime then this is a good buy but if you are looking for a story being told then forget it you won't find it here.
3,Good but not great,"At around 45 minutes, Blood - The Last Vampire is an anime that could have been something. The story introduces the main character, Saya, quickly and gives very little history about her. You're given a little action right from the start then story begins to unfold, but it is never fully developed, leaving you with a bunch of questions. The last 15-20 minutes are filled with more action, but once its done, your left wanting more. The animation itself is great, but again, seeing what the animators are capable of makes you wish the film was longer. If your an anime fan, you should see it, to at least appreciate it for its merit."
1,Stale Blood,"Save yourself some money and a stale aftertaste in the mouth. This DVD should have NEVER reached the market. The story is poor and shallow; the animation is nothing to write home about. This short episode - did you think you were getting a complete story?, is a huge blunder on Manga's part. Do NOT believe for one instant James Cameron's glowing review slapped on the cover! ""The standard of top quality in digital animation""? Yeah right! Next!"
3,"Nice movie, but feels like a teaser","Blood - The Last Vampire is a riveting and involving piece of anime; probably one of the best I've seen in terms of artistry. The animation isn't as fluid as, say, Steam Boy or as technologically groundbreaking, but it uses shadows and sound to get some great suspense going. That said, a nicely tuned TV and audio equipment is a must with this movie.I was supposed to give this movie a 4-Star rating, except for one thing: story, or the lack of it. As a feature film, Blood - The Last Vampire felt more like a teaser than anything else. Little plot, but lots of action, intrigue and excitement. What's more, the video promised a running feature length of 85 minutes...the movie is only about 45 minutes long. The rest is a behind-the-scenes look at the movie."
3,Not a good movie,"I was really expecting much more of this movie. how to start?, the animation is really good, there is no doubt about that, it brings like a new style of animation but even though it looked nice, i've enjoyed much more the animation of other movies like vampire hunter d: bloodlust or ghost in the shell.the plot is bad, it doesn't explain anything about the girl, or the vampires or why use this specific sword or why that or whatever. so you practically see good dialogues but not a nice storyline, the ending is bad too it doesn't look like an ending, and the fights have some action and realistic but not very emotive.it's about 45 minuts lenght so its practically like an unfinished work, i wouldn't pay to watch it. sorry."
1,HOPEFULLY THIS IS THE LAST VAMPIRE,"Sorry, to burst your bubble but this movie [stinks].The animation is top-notch, the story had potential but when you think the movie's about to begin - it ends.After some brief animation, I saw the title screen, and said to myself, that was a decent intro sequence but then I saw the credits rollin!??!!Don't waste your time."
3,OVER RATED!,"My problems with this movie are(a. it's too short (b. there isn't any character development or much story(c.it's not as visually amazing as I'd heard. The environments and fight scenes are gorgeous and the character design is great but there are occasional flaws in the facial expressions of the characters and to an artistic eye it's evident,i would not reccomend paying full price,as a matter of fact just rent it or borrow it from a friend/family member you know who has it.);"
2,Don't believe the hype: Blood,"You've heard enough about Blood's incomplete, incomprehensible story. I heard this stuff and I thought ""Hey, as long as it looks cool, I'll enjoy it."" Wrong. The animation is largely actionless, consisting of tense dialouge and awkward silences. And the heralded action sequences are incredibly short and, frankly, nothing great. Visually, Blood is hardly revolutionary compared to other recent Manga and even high quality U.S. animation like Pearl Jam's incredible Do The Evolution video."
2,not what i thougt it would be....,"this animation, and the fighting, and blood was great. the voices were so,so. and the plot was a complete disappointment.i thought that the action was great, and the transitions were prety good, but i cant say muc for the plot. from what i saw there was none. the slightest thing to a plot that i saw was her trying to kill everything she saw....."
3,"Dude, Where's My Plot?","Apparently the producers of this film feel that a plot is not needed in anime. The action is awesome. The animation is awesome. The characters are awesome. The plot totally sucks. When the movie was over I was left thinking ""is that it???"" It was as if they chopped off the beginning of the movie and then forgot to animate an ending. I would have only given this 2 stars, but I thought the superb animation deserved a little more."
2,Did they cut the beginning and the end?,"I felt like I was watching the middle of a movie! Zero character development, VERY little background...it was, in and of itself, virtually pointless. What is the story behind those demons? Who are they and what do they want? What about the unlikeable and irritating Saya? What is her story, how does she view her position and how did she get there? About the only glimpse you get of her character is an ambigious action she takes towards a dying demon in the end. The animation was stunning, I admit, but I wasted 45 minutes by watching this pointless film."
2,horrible,"The art- pretty goodthe animation - okthe battle secenes- close, but no cigarthe plot- okay, let's not even go there. Siya, the vampire, came, she killed some ppl, she left, with a horribleydirected cliffhanger at the end. The DVD was all aboutsome vampire fighting demons, and leaving, with a 'stunning'photo, Idenifing the 'child' as very old. oooh special.With a cliche plot, mediocre battle scenes, and not thatgreat art, I think I'll return this DVD for something else."
3,"Shallow, quick romp","I don't think I can really add what hasn't already been said about this in terms of the ""film"" (really more of a short) itself. It's moody, well-drawn, and has some pretty decent action, but has no character development, makes no attempt at teling a backstory (which is unfortunate, as Saya at least seems like she'd be an interesting character), and ends at what seems like is the end of just the first act.The thing that actually made me write about this is the packaging. The keepcase says that it's ""83 minutes"", but the feature itself is just over 40 (about 45 with credits), and the rest of the time is the making of. I've always found this practice more than a little deceptive, and I was very disappointed with this.Buyer beware."
1,Tasteless and Insipid Blood,"Hailed as one of the best animes of the last years, ""Blood - The Last Vampire"" shows some promise but ends up being terribly disappointing. Yes, the animation techniques are dazzling and somewhat impressive, so there`s an appealing visual style here. Unfortunately, that`s all there really is. The rest is basically an unconvincing and pointless story that presents unexciting action sequences with cardboard characters and little creativity. If this was a pilot to an anime series, I guess it would be decent, yet nothing special overall, but ""Blood"" is supposedly a movie, and a short one at that. I don`t get the hype and acclaim about this film, given that it`s just another forgettable time-waster. Visually it`s an enjoyable experience, but a (good) movie should be more than some pretty and edgy pictures glued together.Next!"
1,Great eye candy... and not much else.,"The movie was great in theory. It had a plot, great animation, some beatifully designed fight scenes...... But the anime failed as far as character development, and especially character motives, wants, history. The characters were, in the begining, shown in the shadows and ended in the shadows.... Too bad EVERYTHING about the characters were also hidden. Since the characters make the story, this anime falls apart horribly. This anime had GREAT potential, but in falls flat at the end. Its ironic that so much potential was in the end put to waste............. On the bright side, its not bad to be submerged in beatiful eyecandy for slighly over half an hour."
3,AWESOME but...,"When I first saw this movie, I was both blown away and annoyed. The movie is stunning! The visuals are very good so is the music. But the movie is just too short. When it ends, it feels like it has only just begun. Because it is so short, there is very little character development so you never really get to know the main character that well. Because of its length, I reccommend Blood as a rental rather than a purchase."
2,What happened to the film?,"By the creators of ""Ghost in the Shell"" so I figured, it's got to be good. And it was.The story development is good. The action is what you expect. But after only 45 minutes (was it that long?), it ends. And you have half a story, no ending, and what could have been another classic lookes like it ran out of budget and they had to make their $$$ back.I don't know what happened here, but someone goofed. Either finish the film or can it till you can. Something with potential like this should have been worked better than it was. I think someone was rushing this and could have had a great product but, as somone one else said, the film fell far too short. boudica"
2,TOO SHORT!...Nice animation though,This was an O-k flick though............IT'S DAMN SHORT!The story was dull and left things hanging for us to ponder about.And the main character from my opinion seems a little annoying.I only went to get this cause it had vampires in it and I lovevamiper/anime stuff.Leave this title alone and get HELLSING.Leave this crap at the store that it belongs..........Later
2,Among the worst,"This movie is very well animated, in a unique fasion. In that sentence is the whole of this movies goodness. Unintersting storyline, stupid boring main character(also ugly) and short. I don't remember being very impressed by the violence for some reason either, and I do indeed cherish my violence.This movie is way overated, just as VPHD Bloodlust was, and for the same reason, excellent visuals"
1,"More action than horror, more gore than storyline","""Is she still hunting those demons, as we as humans continue to kill each other?"" This is the pseudo-philosophical ending line of this movie, as if to make up for the utter lack of storyline throughout. All in all, this was more action and gore than well-developed storyline/characters. That's fine if you could care less about thought-provoking depth, but if you *do* want thought-provoking depth, then I'd highly recommend Vampire Princess Miyu in place of this braindead and one-dimensional flop."
2,Good illustration poor illustrator,"I blame my high expectations for my negative attitude about this film. The reason I wanted to see the film is because it's always mentioned in the same breath with Vampire Hunter D. Other than being a movie featuring vampires, it's clearly not the same animal. The stereotypic, regressive portrayal of all the black characters in the movie was enough to turn me off, but my thirst for gore or sword playing or vampire slaying or a decent roller coaster ride wasn't satisfied either. The producers spent a great deal of time on the actual animation which was excellent, but very little time developing the story. Thank goodness I got it used, but Manga is still anime King."
2,Not worth the time.,"I've seen over 300 anime & OAVs & this one is nothing special. The animation alone was, well...annoying. Lineless 3DCG & lined cell art go togeather about as well as two nations at war. They used that obnoxious method of animating over live action, just like in the animated Lord of the Rings, only instead of having a creepy feeling to it, it feel more like a movie than animation, & that's bad. The color & texture are good; like the road & wood, etc. The character designs are overly realistic & very hideous. The story was really boring & it ended too quickly. It was like a short crossover of Eko-Eko & Vampire Princess Miyu, only dull & pointless."
4,"i gave it a 4 cause its pretty, but its really a 3...yeah 3","beautiful animation, the visuals alone are worth checking this one out.Movie is super short, and really feels like a sketch for an epic 3 hour long movie. everything is kind of summed up, falls short, and is rushed or boring. wow, that sounded harsh, its really not that bad. this movie had suuuper potential.good gore.i would say that you should definately RENT this, and it makes a good addition to a collection, but i wouldn't demand that you buy it."
4,Brilliantly flawed,"This is a fantastic movie. The artwork and animation is wonderfully saturated with color and fluid movement. Unfortunately, the story of Saya and her mission are nonexistant. We a treated to a glimpse of her mission, but we are never fully brought into the univers in which this story inhabits. Too many unanswered questions, but it is still a great watch"
3,Great but not the best,"This anime had some VERY nice art work, however the story lacked A LOT. It had a great story line but what it didn't give you is details as to what was going on. It's fairly hard to understand what the movie is about. I'd reccomend renting it first if possible. If you're an anime ocllector for art work I definately reccomend getting this then."
3,Hmmm...,"I'd agree with most of the reviews that it is a TAD bit short for the price, but if you're a fan i don't think u'll mind paying for it. Excellent animation sequences for its time, still looks good now. Plot may be a bit profound, but if you don't think too much it looks simple ;P"
3,"It's okey, running time is too short.",A little short but really enjoyable. Animation and plot are superb. If you have a Home theater system in your house you'll be happy to hear and feel the music and the FX of this movie.
1,Very disappointing!,"I am only giving it one star because I can't give it fewer than that! I was so happy when I actually managed to find this at my local video store - but I really wish I hadn't. The story has a lot of holes, there is no real plot, and the action sequences, if that's what you can call them, leave a lot to be desired. I'd opt for something more like Vampire Hunter D."
3,It could have been better,"Teropterids are evil beasts which pose as humans and live on drinking human blood. Fortunately for a human world there are groups dedicated to distroying them. A brooding and mysterious girl named Saya is the best teropterid slayer there is, and now, in 1960's Japan, she sent to a U.S. army base which may be infested."
1,Half and Half....,Half and Half.Not the coffee creamer but sums this movie up.you only get 1/2 of the movie.. it ends so abruptly..you get 1/2 the movie in Japanese with no subtitles...If only the price was also 1/2...
4,Bloody and Intense,"In Japan vampires are posing as humans and killing by the dozens. Saya is a mysterious and brooding girl that is the best defense against the darkness. She is sent to a US army base in order to put an end to the vampire infestation.This anime is very brutal and violent. Definitely not for the faint of heart. If you can handle it, then you will enjoy it. The animation, and story are very good. It's a very dark tale, but it's a great movie and worth watching."
2,Style Over Substance,"Though visually arresting, this short feature offers more style than substance, and like much anime, is limited in terms of character and narrative development. Fun for tweens and teens only."
4,ups and downs....,"When I went to a movie store one night I decided to rent Blood ( me being a HUGE anime and horror buff) When i got home and started to watch it I realized that the animation was not like any other I have ever seen. It was amazing, especially to add computer graphics into it. I just loved that art work. But the bad part about this movie was the story behind it. I understood everything else (except for the ending) but I wanted to know how she came to become a vampire, how the main character Siya became upon this little group, ect. There was absolutley no story behind it. The reason I give this 4 stars insted of 3 is bacause it didnt make me bored I happened to REALLY enjoy the action of this film. I just couldnt take my eyes away from the screen. So overall this is a good film! I would suggest you rent it and watch it first before you decide to but it! :)"
2,Blood... hmm. Flows like Niagara...,"I have just watched the film about ten minutes ago (4:33am Saturday, Sept. 8th 2001) and I must say: No hype there!I am generous enough to give it two stars because of the special effects (which conduct 80% of the film) and because the mother of this film is the same as the mother that brought to life: ""Ghost In The Shell"". The story (what story?) begins in the middle of a first degree murder commited by a minor and ends in the exact same position (only without the girl, she... left town). The blood flows all right... Flows at the same speed my patience ran away about twenty-five minutes into the film. It lacks story (big time) and has nothing going towards it besides hopes for more blood and gore. Very unimpressive and I leave u with only one thing left to say: Please cover for this film with a sequel that makes sense! PLEASE!"
1,Not even comparable with the non anime movie,We go from the impressive fighter in the movie to this pouty somewhat incompetent and socially graceless barely moving character with a crappy attitude? I'm glad I basically only had to pay shipping for this dog. But do watch the real movie- it is incomparably better than this waste of time.
3,Not Bad.,"I had no idea what to expect when I popped this one into the DVD player. I had already watched the live action Blood: The Last Vampire, so automatically I started comparing the first subway scene with the one in this animated version. But it quickly became evident afterward that this movie would not share anywhere near the storyline of the live action movie. And since I haven't seen any of the animated series, I just had to let it take me where it chose to go.I will be honest. I am a storyline/plot fiend. But that doesn't stop me from enjoying a nice action/thriller now and then. I really love the art direction with this one, and the action sequences here are well-planned and do not fail to please. I would love to have seen more plot here, a bit more backstory, but for a short film, this is still definitely worth watching."
4,Short and sweet with no filler,"This is a short, ""no holds barred"" adventure. It reveals enough so the viewer knows what is going on, but little else. (If you want more story, try the live action version.) A female vampire with a sword...you can imagine the rest (without ""fan service""). Of course if you buy this you won't have to imagine..."
3,"Something unique , but yet lacks",I just bought this video today and a part me of is sorry I did . The story line needed to be Much longer then it was . The story doesn`t explain it self . For example who is Saya ? Why are vampires running a mock ? What is with Saya `s reaction when God is ever mentioned and so forth. Now I did say it was unique and here are my reasons .The animation is supurb . The movie has a combanation of both english and Japanese . Think of an Anmerican movie in an other country. Also the concept of the story is still intriging . Again what the movie lacked was a good and longer plot.
2,Don't.,"Two words- TOO SHORT.I sat there for fourty minutes, waiting for the build up that never came. It just left me hanging, my first thought was ""That's it? It's over?""Tha main character is almost likable... almost. There is no drama, only short action scenes that looked cool but you don't care about. The plot line is weak, settings are irrelevant and have no effects on the story whatsoever.When you missed 1. Character-driven story 2. Pure entertainment 3. Great plots, what do you have left? Nothing of course, just some pretty pictures. Perhaps if it was longer, they could make it work.I decided to give it a try because the DVD mentioned ""Ghost In The Shell"". Well, big mistake, this didn't even come close to the level of GITS. In sum, I don't recommand it."
2,Basically no plot,"As some of the other reviewers said, it is quite uninteresting and has no deveopment to speak of.The movie is also way, way too short for the story they are trying to tell.Anyway, i would probably skip this, unless you want to see some blood, and nice animation (the voice acting isn't bad either).If you want to watch what this should have been, go watch the BLOOD+ series, which is much more accurate to the manga, auctually interesting, and wow.. development."
4,Stunning visuals but way too short,"The animators use of shadows and light are very striking, the film is very dark at times so when various other colors do pop up it is all the more effective. The battle scenes are top notch, and the characters are mysterious and noteworthy.However.... the length of the film is such a shock, I did feel cheated somehow...especially ending after such highly memorable scenes as the heroine chasing the last demon along a runway with a huge cargo plane taking off. And... poof....it's over...what [on earth]? Buy this if you find it for cheaper than advertised, but at full price, I do feel cheated. Sorry..."
4,Great Movie,"this anime is truely a piece of art. Though there isnt that much of a story behind it, the animeation does more then make up for it. This is a great movie and every anime fan should add it to their collection."
3,"Great Eye Candy, But...","I read a lot of hype for this movie before it came out, so I was eager to view it. Overall, the artwork and animation is just stunning, with lots of action. Like many others, though, I thought the story just lacked something and left me unsatisfied. When the movie ended my first thought was ""That's it?"" I think the movie is worth watching just for the visuals, but it could have been so much more if they had put the more effort into developing the characters and plot."
4,This was a cool flick,I think I need to clarify things about this flick.... After watching it and rereading some of the reviews I can understand what they were actually saying. It's not a bad movie at all. It was short but the details in the drawings were really great. The story itself was pretty good. It left you with a lot of unanswered questions. I like to think that the 45 min you get was so good that it leaves you wanting more. If there is a sequel to it in the future (which I will get if there is one) I hope it goes deeper into the character and is much longer. My opinion is that this will become a classic. It's a really cool flick and it's worth getting for your collection. Though you may want to shop around since it is a short film and might feel cheated because ot it's length but defintely not because of it's content.
4,"Wonderful Animation, Characthers, Now what about the story?","As mentioned above, Blood has a very high animation quality, and I found the characthers all very appealing, but there seems to be a large storyline hole. We need to learn more! I loved it, but it would be better if we knew something more about it! I'm hoping for a sequel. SEQUEL!! And indeed, their is blood and violence and the like, but it's not half as bad as you'll see in other mangas. Another thing I liked, was there wasn't any nudity..and that's rare now a day's really....Anyhow, you'll be angry when the credits roll by, it ended much too quickly, but that leaves time for a sequel...and whatever this says about missing plot..RENT IT!"
3,"if they'd finished it, it would've been awesome","I was really into this movie. The animation was incredible, and the plot was intriguing. As soon as the first act ended, and the film had an intermission in the action, I was excited to see what was next. Unfortunately, what was next was the credits. The movie was just too short. The breakneck speed of the movie probably made it seem shorter, but still, come on. I've seen episodes of 90210 that are longer than this film. Hopefully, though, there will be a sequel that will expound on the interesting plot elements that were left hanging."
3,Blood: The last 50 min of vampire history,This movie was a definate work of art. Though the movie was short. The characters though dry seemed realistic. The most interesting part about the characters was their lips. This is a characteristic I havent seen in a newer anime only older ones. The plot is simple: Pure blood vampire seeks to rid the world of her half/ciblings with the help of the American government. I gave this a 3 because of the movie length and my complete shock when It ended and I was left mouth agape. Thats it?!?
3,Is there enough blood for this moral story?,"My friend and I saw and reviewed this movie in the back of the DVD pack and was excited to see it. After watching this awesome-filled horror and mystery including unique characters especially the demon-slayer vampire filled with great graphics and sound, we were a little dissapointed due to lack of running time and the shortage of the story. It felt like an hour of watching this astounding movie, but I do understand how a lot of work is paid off to this great movie. However, I sure hope there is another sequel connecting to this movie, but I kinda doubt it. To those of you who like vampires, demons, and blood, I would recommend you to only rent it unless you want to own it."
4,Give us more!,"Visually stunning with realistic animation (most of the time) and a very engrossing story. Pulse-pounding action and a few good scares led to a somewhat abrupt ending. I wanted more background on the characters, especially Saya, and the school nurse. Some of the movements of the ""normal"" people a little jerky. It looked a bit like the zombies walking around in the first ""Resident Evil"" game. Overall, the mood was set early on, it was consistent, and the story was great. It left me wanting much more and I was disappointed when it was over. Buy this one just for the art, if nothing else!"
3,It was good...,"This is not a movie for you little DBZ and Sailor Moon lovers...this is for the real anime fan. It has action...blood...and a little bad language in it.Its not a good plot,AT ALL, the main character Saya is a demon hunter NOT a vampire hunter! And you know how those anime movies that just warm your hearts, where the disturbed main character warms up to one other person or falls in loooooooove with somebody....well this is not one of those stories. The story has NO meaning to it. THE MOVIE: HURT,KILL,DIE...well that sums the movie up...three simple words. Its nothing but KILLING... no emotions, no laughter...just BLOOD BLOOD BLOOD.This movie needs to be rated R, for the nudity, nasty language, and violence."
3,Short and badass,Movie was short only 45 minutes hardly a movie and most of it is her running around for the demons but it was badass visuallywish my ghost in da shell would hurry the hell up
2,Not to repeat...,"...what everyone else has said, but yeah, basically very little plot for this movie. But the animation style is really cool. The use of light, reflection and refraction and great vibrant colors, makes it worth checking out. But on a plot (or action) basis, this film was pretty lacking. Animation had the same ""electric"" look of the series ""Lain."" Coulda been real cool with a good plot, but alas...just eye candy."
1,Pittifully incomplete,"This has got to be one of the biggest insult to anime since Pokemon. This 'movie' (it could hardly be considered a movie - it's only 45 minutes long - MUCH too short) has a shoestring of a plot, NO character development and is so DULL that it seems like 45 HOURS! It SAYS 85 minutes or however long it is on the box, but half of it is in the ""Making of"" feature. The 'real' movie is FAR too short! The creators tried too much to win the audience with good animation. Too bad it will look outdated within a few months at the rate technology is improving... Not to mention that the DVD is seriously overpriced for its content. I wish I could give this ZERO stars!"
5,BEST EVER SERIOUS ANIME,From The makers of Ghost in The Shell Comes BLOOD THE LAST VAMPIREI have seen hundreds of Manga/Animes but this one is definitely at the top of the list because of its amazing animation. It may not have such an amazing story as Perfect Blue for example... But it does have its moments. The animation is very similar to that of ghost in the shell but in a much better and advanced way with CGI effects. IF YOU ARE AN ANIME FAN YOU MUST BUY THIS OR ELSE YOU ARE JUST SCUM.
5,Vampire kid joins secret cop squad,"A little artsy for my taste, but plenty of action, gore, and splatter. Some scenes are so realistic you'd swear it was film, not Anime'. The plot was original, setting just the right amount of strange, and baddies you want to see get squashed. A definite buy for Anime' or Vampire fans."
5,Think of it as a prelude...,"Before I watched ""Blood,"" my brother told me the only thing wrong with it is the length - a mere 45 minutes. And when I watched it, I could not believe that it was over, but it was. Despite its length and the fact that nothing much is explained, BECAUSE of its length I consider this a prelude of things to come. After I watched this movie, I immediately thought of this as a series - this being the clip before the opening credits. The animation is incredible and the voices work moreso than ever. And the original spin that is put on vampires is exactly that - ORIGINAL. I give it five stars because this movie should be watched by all who are into anime. With keeping an open mind that this will not be the last we see of Saya (the main character in ""Blood""), you will see that this movie ranks among the very best."
2,too short,"This movie had a lot of potential, manga movies always have gr8 art, good storylines/plots, action..everything, however even though this movie was 83 mins long, it did not explain much and it leaves u with an unfullfilled desire 2 watch more. it is a gr8 movie, however it should have more 2 it (2 explain the character saya, and the other demons in the movie, and her involvement with the military). There could have been so much more put in2 this movie, but it was just a let down."
1,Last Vampire?,"The animation was cool looking, but that's all this movie had going for it. It was too short, and the story wasn't worth telling."
1,Blood - The Last Vampire,The animation is really good but the movie begins in n odd way. And it ends leaving you confused.
3,So much potential...,"They call this a movie... but at a full length of 45 minutes, it's more like a long movie trailer.Overall the movie had a really great style to it. The digital touches to the art really helped create an appropriate mood for every scene. The sounds and music were well done. The characters were well displayed... yet sorely under developed.Watching just the movie alone, the plot is non existent. The description on the back of the DVD does a better job at explaining what's going on then the entire film.The movie was a short yet stylish romp. If they had only made it twice as long and developed the story and characters MUCH more, then it could have easily been a classic. But as it stands, it's nothing but a pretty thing to stare at for a few minutes.Probably not worth purchasing. Even paying $4 to rent is a strech. Maybe just try to borrow it from a friend if you can... because you could easily have it back to them within an hour."
3,"Good Anime, but worth the money? Well...............","One of the reasons I buy anime so rarely on DVD is the cost. When I look at an anime DVD I check to see how long it is, this one said 87 (or so) minutes. Not bad......so I bought it and after 30 min or so (I really liked it and I was waiting for part two to start) it was over. What? The companies that produce the DVD's must know that there are people out there like me who want a good time to dollar ratio so they include the special features in the running time.....clever. But now I rent 'em before I buy 'em. This was a good flick, don't get me wrong, but I wanted to get a little more story for my cash. I was expecting the length of Vampire Hunter D, not Dragon Ball Z."
2,Film brevity makes for huge letdown,"Don't be duped by Manga Corp. this movie is 45 minutes long! Even though the DVD case may say 83 minutes. That's 83 minutes when you add in the trailers, behind the scenes material, etc. Trust me, its 45 minutes long.Don't get me wrong. Blood (TLV) is a sonic and visual feast. The computer generated back drops, the DD 5.1 soundstage have the beginnings of a great film. Its too bad the movie just stops in the middle of the story. No mention of sequel or anything.Manga Corp. did almost as good a job hoodwinking us with the film, as the Sci Fi channel did with the ""Series Finale"" of Farscape.Buy this used or discounted. It's not worth your hard earned money at $25 for 45 minutes!"
3,I love it...,"But i had to be honest with my review. Blood:TLV has it's fair share of problems. First we have length the movie clocks in at about 45 minutes, that is definetly not enough. The animation is stunning,visualy there are no complaints. The plotline revolves around a military base in Japan just before the Vietnam war, in the military compound are vampires so the american goverment sends in a secret weapon: Saya, the last original. The last original what?? It is never explained, just like many other ""plot points"" in this ""movie"" things are never explained. The ""plot"" is just an excuse to have 20 minutes of non-stop action.The acting is very peculiar the american characters speak english and the japanese characters speak japanese(with subtitles). The acting is decent EXCEPT for the teacher who is a horrible actress. Overall i love this movie but i really can't recommend it, unless you are an anime fan. EP"
2,"too short, barely any plot, but nice to look at","This movie was way too short. I didn't check the length before hitting ""play"" so when the movie was about to end, I was thinking, ""Ok, that was a decent intro sequence, I wonder what's going to happen in the main part of the movie."" Then the credits rolled. Doh.There is basically no character development and the plot is pretty thin (there are monsters, the protagonist must kill them). Some of the visuals are nice, but otherwise there's not much to recommend this movie. ...this one is rental fodder. Not worth buying..."
2,Not woth the money,"Thisw book fails on a few levels. First, the quotes picked are often short, unrelated, or contradictory, including a couple which are simply theistic. Second,Williams iserts his own little exclamatory remarks throughout the book (things like ""Oh Aristotle, how lucky we were to know you!). The format has the quote from the famous luminary on the right page, and Williams words, thoughts or praise on the left. With all due respect, William's words could have been kept to an introduction, rather then half the book. Especially considering he just acts as an MC for those quoted, he doesn't add any thoughts of substance.Were this book ($$$), I wouldn't be so harsh on it. But ($$$) for a book that's a not particularly well produced, undersized hardcover, it's ridiculous. Take the money and by the works of the contributors instead."
3,"Book in good shape, but has an odor.","The book is in good shape, but it has an odor as if it had gotten damp or exposed to moisture in storage."
4,"Interesting, yet somewhat pathetic","Ethel Kennedy's shining exterior as the sainted widow is systematically tarnished with every passing page in this revealing look at her life. For those of us who remember that era, Mrs. Kennedy was nothing short of a saint in the face of tragedy. And the images of the pregnant widow with all those children made us feel deep sympathy for her situation. After reading Mr. Oppenheimer's book, it would seem that Ethel was not only a fiercely jealous, overly competitive barracuda, but also a terrible cheapskate. The Kennedy version of Leona Helmsly, with one exception, Leona was at least intelligent. It was obvious that the only person capable of controlling Ethel's behavior was Bobby Kennedy. Her treatment of staff and family after his death (including her own children) will leave the reader's mouth hanging open. When I was finished, I wondered why no one sent this woman for therapy!"
4,Great Book on SC Lowcountry,A great glimpse into the antebellum life of a sportsman in the South Carolina Lowcountry. Life as it was before Hilton Head became a tourist destination.
2,Not highly recommended!,"We had a really cheap monitor before we bought this one because it was just so noisy.. so we bought this one thinking it was going to be quieter. Well, it is ALOT quieter than our monitor, but like others said, it makes this awful beeping noise! It has gone off twice in the middle of the night before! We also have another digital phone, so it is constantly switching channels as well trying to find an available channel. I would look elsewhere for another monitor.. The beeping is what gets to me - I dont like being woke up by a very loud beep in the middle of the night!Edit: Since we moved 8 months ago.. we continue to use this monitor. We no longer have a digital phone in the house.. and the beeping has stopped. It is quiet, you do not have to worry about batteries, it is rechargeable, very portable, and is just so quiet now..! If you have another digital device in your home.. do NOT get this monitor.. if you dont have digital devices.. then this is the monitor to get!"
1,Beware!,We had the Fisher Proce sound and lights monitor and decided to go digital. This was the one we picked in our price range. We had it for a few weeks and absolutely loved it...until there was some weather changes. Every time the weather was not clear the monitor could not find a signal and made a terrible beeping sound! Buy the sound a lights for $15 and save the extra money!!
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"This monitor is awful. I have had it for 5 months and it has only worked properly for 1. It makes loud beeping noises at the oddest times, like 2 am!!! Do not buy this monitor. The onlt thing it has going is it is nice looking!!!!"
1,"Great At First, and then...","I've had the same experience as a lot of others. My monitor worked fairly well for several months- though without very good range. Now all the sudden, it shows that it's working without actually picking up anything. It's just started not recognizing that the unit in the baby's room is on. I have to turn it on and off over and over before finally getting anything. I'm also looking for another monitor and will get one today. Please don't waste you time and money!"
1,"Same as everyone else, don't bother....","I see lots of people with the SAME problem I have had, so it apparently isn't a freak issue.I bought this monitor because ones we've used in the past have had a lot of static and have picked up the neighbor's children.This one worked great at first, but after a month of use it started having lapses, little hiccups, shall we say. Then it started letting out a shrill beep for no apparent reason. Going right back to normal use. Lovely inthe middle of the night. But, the really insidious problem that made me return it was when it stopped working, but yet LOOKED like it was working. Green light on, soft white noise coming from the unit, but that was not what was going on in the baby's room! My poor boy might have cried all night and I wouldn't have known.I have to say, PASS ON THIS MONITOR!"
2,Stops working,I like the monitor sound quality and background noise is not bad compared with other models. However I can NOT recommend this because it sometimes just stops transmitting the sound sometime in the night and gives no indication that it has stopped working. This morning I woke up and didn't realize my toddler was crying since the monitor was on with the green light. I actually have two of these monitors since I have twins and this is the 2nd one that has stopped working intermittedly.
1,loses contact,"I purchase this monitor for travel purposes...small and easy to use with the rechargeable battery. I wish I had read these reviews prior to purchase. I still use it but with precautions. I have to say, I do use it around my house b/c our other monitor (with camera) makes a lot of static noises when it's out of range or there is wirless interference. The problem I have is that sometimes everything seems quite, but in reality it's not transmitting...even though both ends are plugged in - and the other monitor does transmit baby's crying. It also make the anoying sound that other reviewers have mentioned. My home is less than 2500 sq ft and it often loses signal. I would recommend checking out other makes/models before purchasing this unit."
1,Don't waste you money,"This monitor is worthless, basically it doesn't work! It constantly beeps signalling 'out of range' even when it's only a few feet away. On top of that it also makes a loud clicking sound, so if you want to get any sleep don't buy this monitor. Even if it was $5 it would be a waste of money. If I could I would give it negative 5 stars-it's a complete joke!!"
2,annoying beep,"This monitor works as well as most others but not better. Unfortunatly ithas a vary loud and annoying beep when the signal is lost, even for a short while. This feature cannot be turned off."
1,Two units and neither worked,"Our first unit worked for 1 month then died inexplicably. The unit we got in exchange didn't work right out of the box. Stay far, far away from this product. I wouldn't trust anything from this manufacturer at this point."
3,OK if you have a small house,"This monitor was very good when I was on the top floor of our house, where the baby is. But when I went downstairs the static was horrible. Got the Sony 27 Channel one after that, and it was much, much better."
3,Summer Infant Secure Sounds 2.4 Ghz Digital Monitor,"I like the monitor because it has great sound, that's its down fall too. It picks up absolutely every sound and because it doesn't have a dial for volume but a set clicker, you can't turn it down just a little bit. I hear my child breath like I hear the sound effects at a movie, you don't only hear a pin drop but a speck of dust hitting the floor too."
1,Panasonic DVDs seem to suffer early burnout,"I was happy with this for about 8 months, then it stopped working. On searching the web, I found that the dreaded code H07 is an all too common symptom of failure of various Panasonic DVDs, and that it costs as much to repair it is to buy a new system. Nevermore!"
1,Purchased an entire case,"I purchased this case of 12 from Amazon. Product I have used before but the price was better on Amazon. Opening the box, I was greeted with several tops to these spray cans and some of the product had obviously been expelled from these cans. While trying to refit the tops back onto the cans, I realized they were all cracked off and could not be reapplied to the cans. Product in those cans were useless. I bought from Amazon since I have always had good experiences with them. This one was a DUD. Now, trying to get these cans back to Amazon with the broken tops is going to be a hassle I do not need. I have to eat this one but I have learned from this experience. Go to the store and spend the extra bucks. At least this way I will be able to use what I purchase."
3,"Great book, but becoming dated","Dr. Shaw has made many contributions that have helped many children, mine included. A few years ago I referenced this book often, looking for ways to help my son. At the time, I would have recommended this book as a must have for every parent.However, at this point it is becoming fairly dated. If you were to attend a DAN! conference today, you would see that their focus, and our understanding of the science has changed.If you are considering purchasing this book, you are, I assume, as I was a few years ago -- in a real big hurry to find the best information you can to help someone you love. So to that end, I would recommend instead of this book:""Children with Starving Brains"" by Jaquelyn McCandless""Autism: Effective Biomedical Treatments"" by Syndey Baker and Jon Pangborn""Special Diets for Special Kids"" by Lisa Lewis""Breaking the Vicious Cycle"" by Elaine Gottschall."
1,Does not work,I have spent thousands of dollars in these treatments for my son over last 3 years with no difference at all. Feel free to contact me personally.Dr. and people like these are out there to victimize parents of autistic kids.
4,Nice second book!,"This is a continuation of the Fandy books. This one is set in the beginning of the team's relationship, and it brings out the characters dark and weaker sides. It is a little more violent than some of the other books, but still a good read. It was nice to be able to envision the team as they were just starting out."
4,Reads just like an episode,"This truly does read like an episode right off of TV. Although the story doesn't read like it's their first mission and there are a few too many times the author has Daniel Jackson use the term/word ""God"" and a few other small details in dialogue - it reads well and keeps you interested until the end. Very nice storyline and a joy to read."
4,Never disappoints!,"Fan of SG1, loved the action. Great read! So much like the tv show, which is fantastic. I am now truly addicted to this series and look forward to reading them all."
3,Not one of the best...,"As far as Stargate novels go, this is not one of the better ones. It has a horror element that never would have made it into the show. Too much gore for a family audience. There is plenty of action and whumping of our beloved characters, especially near the end, though, if that is your cup of tea. The middle takes patience and perseverance to get through. If you're looking for a Stargate novel that could have easily been an episode of the series, read The Barque of Heaven instead. That one is great!"
1,Worst stargate novel yet!,Being an avid fan I looked forward to this book only to find it anything but the Stargate fun I found in the other novels. This book's genre should be classified as horror and the plot is just a small part of the horror. Some parts are interesting but then it goes way over in redundant boring fight scenes that make you feel like a b slasher movie. I am glad to see that that author has never published again for Stargate novels. Anything but an enjoyable read.
5,Outstanding book,"Sacrifice Moon, by Julie Fortune, is, hands down, the best Stargate SG-1 book.But more than that, it is a very good book on its own merits -- well written; good characterization; a very nice ""team"" feel. It is set very early in the series so the characters are getting to know each other, and we find out more about them. There is exploration, and first contact with an alien culture, but the mission turns dark quickly and the adventures start coming fast and furious as the tension mounts.I strongly recommend this book. Enjoy!"
5,Pato Fu is very cool,"If you doesn't have this CD order it now! This is a example of the new best pop brazilian music. And it isn't a common pop. They have influences of japaneses music, pisicodelical and progressive music and naturally, brazilian pop music. They have any guitar solos and riffs that I think that is a Rock Band. What are you waiting for? Buy it and Ruido Rosa now!!!Nanete do Boquete escreveu isto."
4,It's Judgment Time!,"My 7 year old son really likes his morpher, especially the different modes it has and that it looks like a cell phone. It seems to be pretty high quality. Go go Power Rangers."
2,WARNING! No power switch.,"Nicely built surge strip but the orange button shown is NOT a power switch. This strip does not have a power switch. I guess they don't list one in the ""features"" but I kind of expected it to have one. Not sure why this is ""Premium"" without the ability to turn off the strip."
3,Student solutions Manual,"Book arrived in good condition, although the corner was smashed. It was probably damaged in shipping but got to me in a reasonable amount of time. As for the book content I am disappointed. The reason I bought this book was to help me work through the homework step by step but I have found that in the break down of the questions they are missing some key steps that I needed the book for in the first place! Its better than nothing, I was just expecting it to be more helpful."
3,Technical Calculus,I am a Jr at a local college and have enjoyed this book. There are many examples to follow making it easy to learn from. Enjoy your calculus!
5,Practical for daily life,"This book is a very easy read, yet displays wonderful insight into finding one's true happiness in life. The author allows the reader to fully understand what our true purpose as human beings really is and our inherent 'need' to practice ""love that gives""."
5,Simple ways to change our perspective,I liked this book a lot. It stated simply ways to change my perspective. The part about remember how we started with nothing was a good wake-up call. Reminded me to be thankful. I definitely recommend this for anyone who feels stuck and needs some encouragement.
2,Black Metal Satanica Documental,"This documental it's ok, but in my opinion need more interviews with some elemental bands in black metal, it center more, in the third generetaion of black metal, so if you want to see, just photos of newspapers about what happened in the early days, and the history of the murder of Euronymous and all that mess, it's ok, and well, if you don't understand english, don't buy it, it doesn't have subtitles."
2,Black Metal Satanica,"I think this dvd is more for those who are unfamiliar with the black metal subculture, or having just been introduced to black metal music, and would like to know a 'little' more. There's few interesting interviews, of where black metal genera originated. And a bit about the infamous Mayhem/ Burzum story. But it would have been nice to have interviews with many other black metal musicians, rather then back and forth between a few. This is more a dvd, for beginners, or those who view this subculture from the outside, who can have a little insight on how 'gastly' it all is...haaahaa..."
1,Shoot,"Very embarrassing. Some idiots make a black metal documentary and speak to some loser, peripheral characters and that's it. Awful!"
4,Death metal from where it began,"This entertaining documentary is made by people who originate from the same region where the music was first created, meaning Sweden and Norway. For that reason it stays closer to the actual events and climate that led to the black metal boom some 20 years ago. It is easy to sensationalize all this, or put a wrong bias on it, when it was in fact just a bunch of frustrated teenagers who found a new and powerful way to rebel against the special climate in Scandinavian society. The quality of the interviews and interviewees vary, and it would have been useful to hear from some of the few key players in the original scene... but since several of them are dead or in prison, this was obviously difficult. I enjoyed this, it's good for someone with a moderate interest in the scene, while it may not work that well for hardcore, veteran black metal fans (or opponents)."
4,Recommended by Cook's Illustrated,"I bought this cutting board based upon Cook's Illustrated's review. As seems always to be the case, they were right on... it is an excellent board.Pros:- great cutting feel (a LOT like a good wooden board)- lightweight- fits in the dishwasherCons:- as both sides of the board are meant to be used, neither side has rubber feet to keep it from sliding under the knife. I use a damp towel or washcloth that holds it rock-steady.Recommended."
4,Durable and does not dull my knives much,"I like the red dot to signal (if you like) that as your raw meat cutting side. Dishwasher safe.Update: I've had this for four years now. You can see the knife marks. The knife marks are stained, but they are not so deep as to hinder normal cutting board use. I would buy this product again."
4,Yard Machine snow thrower,"Not as light weight as I would have preferred but definitely portable, handle folds down to facilitate summer storage. Starts easily when new will see how long this lasts but has electric start option just in case. Easy to handle and operate as I'm 59 year old female. Great price for this item."
3,Buyer Beware,"I have rated this a three for the effort made to make this game available on DVD. The problem isn't the game but the quality. I purchased under the assumption that the game had been copied for NBC's archives. This doesn't appear to be the case. Literally! The quality lends one to believe that this game was drawn from someone's VHS or BETA tape. The tracking lines and other little ""blips"" common with videotape playback seem to support this belief. Don't misunderstand, the game is watchable. It just wasn't the professional production that I thought was being purchased."
5,the PERFECT Guide,"Being an Spaniard I has been compelled to buy this guide in English because the spanish edition was exhausted...Nowadays, and after my trip to Berlin I can say: Yes, really the Perfect Guide!!!"
1,Useless book,"This book is completely unhelpful for anyone spending time in Berlin. I've lived in Berlin in the past but wanted a new travel book to help me see all of the newer sights. Even for someone who already knows her way around the city, this book was confusing and useless. The maps are all oversimplified to the point that they won't help you find anything, and the descriptions about where things are will get you completely lost or cause you to waste a ton of time. For example, the book's recommended ways to spend particular days are absolutely impossible to do. As someone who knows Berlin, I noticed that their sample schedules told people to go to places that are sometimes more than an hour and a half apart by public transportation and then travel back along the same route to get to another sight or activity. I felt like this was a waste of money, and I should have gotten the Lonely Planet or Let's Go guilde."
4,Eyewitness Berlin,The book was very useful. We have used these guides in several cities and they are always informative and well arranged. My only disappointment with this one was the map section. It lacked a good overall map. Once we got on the correct page it was OK but it was cumbersome to get there.
3,Good overview of wood,"A good overview of wood, but do not expect to be an expert after reading this book. A good introduction to wood for the novice or woodworker with limited experience with exotic woods."
4,Good reference book for the beginner and expert woodworker,"Very good book, can be used as quick reference guide when trying to choose a wood to build any furniture, I found very useful the fact that it shows the wood appearance with and without finish so one figure out how the colour will change when a finish is applied.For the ecological concious woodworker it tells you those species that are endangered. It describes the characteristics of each wood, hardness, grain, workability etc.The only drawback I found was that I would have appreciated that in addition to the latin name and english one it should show the name of the wood in other languages"
3,Never After - Interrupted,"I was really enjoying the book, liked all the fairy tale elements retold and right after the frog gets kissed, I turn the page and whamo! Blamo! I have upside down pages pages 183 -214 of Between Lovers by Eric Jerome Dickey. The book stops in the middle of a sentence! I am very frustrated. I tried the Penguin web site and there is no way to leave a message. I feel that the rest of the book should be posted on the web site so that I can find out how it ends! I'm hoping that there will be a copy at the bookstore that has the entire book. Penguin should apologize to every reader."
4,Fairy tale entwined with some contemporary twists---really 3.5 stars,"I love ""Fractured Fairytales"" so ""Never After"" was a must-read for me.When Prince Athelstan goes questing for the perfect bride, he discovers that behind the circle of thorns enshrouding the castle legend said held Sleeping Beauty, there were only sleeping princes. He returns with his cousin, Vevila, who is equally tired of courtship and is going out to seek adventure.There's a whole cast of odd characters to boot and a lot of genuinely good laughs. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Lickiss' work."
3,Cheerful & Witty but. . .,"A Twelve-year-old reading fanaticI thought this story was really good, but I thought Prince Alth(how do you spell it?) really dropped the whole story down a notch on the enternainment level. I was reading the other reviews, and I think that ""something"" that it's missing is the climax, it's good and all, but there is no part where they're rushing against time, they simply talk and do amusing things and then suddenly the curse is broken and we're to the conclusion. Another thing that I found dissapionting Vevila's ending, she just agrees (if you've read it you'll know what to)too easily at the end. The ""Library's Review"" (one of the reviews, I'm not sure if that's the correct one)said that the wizards don't do anything, and I disagree they let you know what's going on, because the prince is far too stupid to know or bother to tell anyone, so All in all I'd recommend picking this book up at the library to read once, but not to buy."
5,A great fairy tale spoof-had me laughing out loud.,"This was one of the funniest books I've read in some time. Take Sleeping Beauty, the Princess and the Pea, Cinderella, and Rumplestilskin, add one take-no-prisoners princess, and you've got a great read. Not quite the British humor you'd see in Terry Pratchett, but great fun throughout. If you're looking for bodice-ripping romance, look elsewhere. If you want a thouroughly enjoyable, solid, humorous spin on fairy tales, try this book."
2,Could have been great...,"However, there were many problems with this book. There was absolutly no character development. I felt the characters were flat and the reader never understood WHY the characters were doing the things that they did. The entire book read like a storyboard outline or a skeletal framework that was never fleshed out into the full potential that it could have been. The anti-climactic ending. The entire book could have been related in one or two chapters as a flashback to the real story; the ending was just beginning the real story of saving a kingdom that could have been filled with adventure... sadly we are given... they go to ""save the kingdom and they all lived happily ever after."" I was highly disappointed that I spent the money on it."
4,A good book about a little known aspect of World War II.,"This book focuses on an aspect of WWII that is little known in this country beyond crude jokes about the ability of the Italian Army. It focuses mainly on organization training and equipment of Italian Army soldiers, and is similar to the Osprey ""Men at Arms"" series in content, although it is much more detailed, is in hardback, and uses actual photographs exclusively, with little or no drawn illustrations. It is light on weapons and armaments, and also on the actual historical events that the Italian Armed Forces were involved in, however it does have some excellent eye witnesses accounts of what service in that force was like. All in all, a good place to start your research into this interesting area, but to fully understand it, you will have to go much further."
1,Sad,"I didn't get to see a picture of this entire product before I purchased it. I assumed it was something I could set up to keep an eye on my precious cargo as I walked. I didn't realize it would simply be a hand held mirror tied to a pouch with a shoe lace! I didn't spend a lot of money on it or I would have been pretty irritated. The pouch is pretty cool, but I don't think the mirror is all that useful."
2,Very realistic and cute but quality isn't the best,"The toy looks like a real cheetah cub which is what my grandaughter wanted. She really loves it. Unfortunately, several of the leg seams were not sewn shut. With the price of this stuffed animal I expected exceptional quality. The quality of the product was disappointing."
4,Great but expensive,"I bought this for my daughter to go with the life size Mama cheetah. The big one I purchased at more than half off its normal price. I was so thrilled to get such a great price that I bought the baby too. It's beautiful and very realistic but $50 seems a bit too much. In the end it's worth the happiness that it will bring my daughter, but everytime I look at it I think about how much I spent."
2,No secondary bibliography,Looks like this new edition continues to have the major flaw of my 1992 edition--no bibliography for biographies and critical studies.
5,Great!,"Henry and Mudge and the Starry Night (Ready-to-Read, Level 2)We have about 9 of these books. Each is a unique story, there is no formula here. They are creative stories that deal with real life situations in a special Henry and Mudge fashion. They are warm and loving and fun. Henry loves his big dog Mudge. I am going to buy more of them."
3,Americopy 200 STANDARD Black CD Jewel Case (Assembled),"Packing is always a problem for these jewel cases. Do not put any packing material around them, just a box in a box and I always get broken ones, sometimes more than I like but too big a hassle to return."
1,WORST CD CASES EVER,"Worst quality CD cases I have ever purchased in twenty years. The so called clear plastic case is very foggy nasty looking, guess from Chinese pollution and so flimsy they wave at you. Over half were broken upon arrival which was also a major flaw. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !"
5,Great Logic Game for Kids,"My 6 year old really loves this game. He will sit still for over 1/2 hour just pouring over the different possible solutions to the puzzles. (Sitting still for 1/2 hour for my kid is some kind of record.) The pieces are nice and durable plastic, and the booklet with the puzzles is on good thick paper. My 60+ year old mother came over last weekend and got absorbed into figuring out the puzzles too. Fun for everyone."
4,Great fun for all ages,Purchased this toy for a 6-year-old but kids (and adults) that enjoy mind teasers and puzzles will also enjoy this one. It's extremely well-made and sturdy and can provide hours of entertainment for kids who love to solve puzzles. Highly recommended!
3,RIP Vesta,"though this album wasn't seeing her earlier work, but it had some moments. she was still something else vocally and one of the most underrated vocalist Ever to me. she truly had soul and feeling when put her all into a song. i remember when she backed up chaka khan and was somewhat in her shadow on the artistic side for a minute, but believe me Vesta Williams after some good material and her strong vocal presentation carved out her own spot and place. she never got her due, but she stayed in her lane and did her thing and I always dug her talent and she was cool People. RIP and her music was always cool and to the real."
5,IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH VESTA,I Love vesta Voice. It is pure and strong and filled with emotion Her live performances are outstanding and leave you breathless. Cheering for more. this album had a few GEMS. But She's done better
5,Totally Underrated!,"I can't believe this album received bad reviews. It's one of the few that still stay in rotation on my CD player in my house and Car. Vesta gives you something to bop your head to, snap your fingers at and contemplate about. This is a grown folks CD, so if you're use to the screaming, R&B or Pop-wanna be divas, then don't bother because you surely will be disappointed. Kudos to Vesta for letting her sounds and voice grow.... this is a great driving CD too... cruise on..."
1,"2,000 Dollars","$2,000 .....BookGroveMediaAre you for real...... to see someone try to profit over someone's death...... it is the ultimate disrespect to MISS VESTA WILLIAMS ....you should be ashamed of yourself. I'll remember that sellers name and will never order from you."
3,Better Material Needed!,"Other than ""You Still Do It"" this one'snot a great album. Here's the solution:Hire one great songwriter, one greatproducer and try again Vesta. Try BrianMcKnight or Leon Ware."
4,First date pleaser,I liked This album the first time I heard it. This albulm should be a part of every serious R&B music lover's collection.
1,Horrific Voice!,This man cannot sing! He sounds like a freight truck going across a bumpy road! I recommend Kindred-family soul or Javier-. These 2 discs will blow you away. Great quality music! I wil be selling this cd!
3,Quite good,"The music is quite exciting, but the tracks are too repetitive. No track, excepted the 14th (Anti-Social), the best, is different than the other one. I can't listen to that CD more than 20 minutes !"
2,horrible,"i've beeen into happycore since '96. i got this cd when it first came out and ive been wanting to say something about it since. it (is not good). chapter 6 just came out and i suggest you get that instead. if you already have it, you prolly already have #3 so get the 1st one, to me its the best because it reminds me of the old skool days."
1,Get rid of the cheese!,"I was very dissapointed with this cd. All of the tracks on this cd are really chessy, the lyrics are horrible. If you like happy hardcore do not get this cd"
3,"to buy, or not to buy?","One thing about this cd is that it contains an excessive amount of female vocals and cheesy lyrics. the drum and bass lines are the same throughout the whole cd which makes it somewhat boring. the beat is more of a constant gabber with a couple tricks thrown in the mix here and there. I think this cd would be more suitable for the ladies. this cd is barely techno. Overall, it isnt to terrible of a listen."
4,"Second Verse, Good as the First.","This CD is the second offering in the Happy2bHardcore series, continuously mixed by DJ Anabolic Frolic. I bought this CD solely because of what I heard in the first Happy2bHarcore release. It was a blind buy but it was well worth it. This release was better than the previous one.Some of the best tracks are #4) ""Vinylgroover - Time"" a remake of the Cindi Lauper Classic, #6) ""Bang - Cloudy Daze"" all about the joy of sunshine, #10) ""DNA & Breeze - Kick your Legs"" a great example of techno love songs. If you thought the first CD was good than you are bound to like this one as well.I recommend it for any hardcore techno heads out there. Check out the third in the series if you get a chance.**WARNING! ** Listening to this CD may cause you to be overcome with the urge to dance, frolic and be happy. Do not be afraid. This is normal. Now with that in mind, listen safely. :)"
5,This is the One,"I wish this wasn't the first techno cd i listned to cause nothing compares to it, nothing it is on a whole another level.this is ablum is worth every penny and if you ain't got the money you better hit your couch up for some money. the cd is hard trance and that is what it is from start to finsh. it leaves you with wanting more."
4,"This is great! But, it will does not last...","My husband and I also received this system for our first born. We used it everyday, and loved being able to check on our son without walking down the hall (and risk waking him!). With that said, just after having it 2 years the TV monitor went out. Very annoying since we are expecting our second! We are going to buy a new one, but we not expecting it to last for a third child, maybe we will be surprised. Since it only lasted 2yrs I guess it cost me 20 cents a day, not too upset. Buy it! This is totally worth it!"
2,Montior feedback,I am not particularly impressed with this item. I have it set in two rooms and there is so much feedback to the parent unit that I cannot have it scan between the two rooms which it is intended for. I tried all of the suggestions in the owner's manual and none of them work. There is also a lot of feedback with the one camera in motion. I would not recommend this item to anyone.
4,Also great for a year.,"Just as another reviewer stated, shortly after one year the power unit cracked. Ordered another power unit just to find out the whole monitor had quit working also. We loved it until then."
1,Poor Customer Service!!!,"Like other reviewers...I loved the product for the first year. My wife and I turned it off anytime the baby wasn't sleeping. But after a year, the power cord would no longer stay plugged into the monitor. It's probably a 50 cent repair, but their ""company policy"" is to not do repairs. Instead, I have to pay nearly $50 to get a new one! I just can't comprehend not standing behind your product!! I wouldn't buy any product from this company again!"
2,"Like Police Academy, but better.","A fun little movie that features Linnea Quigley and Ken Abraham who teamed up in that awful film ""Creepozoids."" Cast also feature's former porn queen Ginger Lynn Allen, who does pretty well with her character. Great rock n roll music. Campy fun. But needed some improvements."
2,Scream queen Quigley and porn queen Allen reunite!,"Sequel to the first movie with just about the same cast. Ken Abraham and B-movie actress Dawn Wildsmith dropped out on this one, but newcomers, such as Favourite Fred Olen Ray actor Jay Richardson, who teamed up with Quigley in ""Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers"" plays the headsman at the Vice Academy police station. There's also an actress who plays a powerful robot called Bimbo Cop. This one's just as good as the original, with a great rock music score, but is still a ""Police Academy"" ripoff, and a B-movie! Ginger Lynn Allen takes her top off in a scene of this movie(Not surprising) but she still does a good performance."
4,A very nice surprise!,"I stumbled across 'The Fallen' while crusing for new horror fiction. I had never heard of Dale Bailey. This is a solid novel, and up there with Shannon's ""Night of the Beast"" and Cleggs ""Hour Before Dark"" which means among the best of 2002. A real sleeper and a nice surprise."
2,Disappointing and cliched,"I expected a lot more from this book. There is no difference between this novel and any number of pulpy horror novels. I realize Bailey has a reputation from his short stories, but that's no reason to overlook the flaws in this novel. It is mediocre at best. I was very disappointed."
4,Love it!,Absolutely love this piece! I get many compliments on it as well. It is exactly as it appears and in my opinion is the perfect size. I did change out the chain for a silk cord which I think looks better.
2,does not worth the money,"i just got mine and i m gonna reture it, it's sooooo big(larger than 1 dollar coin) and the silver chain is about 20 inch long. i will share pics later."
1,Less than one star was not available,"The techniques of using transformers of more than 15V are AGAINST THE NATIONAL ELECTRICAL CODE! If 22V was legal, the big boys like Kim Lighting, Vista Pro Lighting, Hadco Lighting and Nightscaping would offer it too. The term that comes to mind after my reading was ""Snake Oil Salesman"". I pray the novice will see the other available options and choose them instead. Mr. Mullen is doing a great disservice to the Low Voltage Lighting community."
2,hitman,"this cd is not that good. it has like 2 good songs on it, thats about it... if u have 47 cents then u can buy this crap... trust me, it is not worth more"
3,"The novel ""TWINK""","This novel is another touching piece of work by John Newfeld it is written in the same style as his earlier novels, ""EDGAR ALLAN ,"" LISA BRIGHT AND DARK."" It is about a sixteen year old kid whose mother dies and goes to live with his father and step mom and his half sister, and all the struggles they go through with his half sister Twink who is diagnosed with cerabral palsey, I recomend that you read this book I thought it was a great piece of work."
3,"Good Collectable, but Not Much Else","Okay, so we all know that Lucille Ball as Mame was panned by critics left and right. We all know that she was too old for the role, that she couldn't sing very well, and so on and so forth. But darn it, I just had to have this CD for some reason. And I listen to it still too! Jerry Herman is the reason why. His songs, though arranged much differently than the Broadway score, still shine through through Ball's low voice. Robert Preston is in fine form, singing ""Loving You,"" a song written especially for the movie. This CD is really not all that different from the original Warner Brothers' Soundtrack LP in terms of quality. But there is interesting infromation in the CD booklet about the movie. So, if you want to hear Lucy in her last film, buy it. If you want to just listen to the music form Mame, then get the Broadway cast."
2,I LOVE LUCY BUT NOT IN THIS!,"I've been a huge fan of Lucille Ball for years but she just isn't Mame or Auntie Mame for that matter. It's not just that she was too old for the part or lacked a singing voice, she was terribly miscast, plain and simple.If Angela Lansbury had played the part and Lucy had taken a ""Guest Star"" role as Vera Charles, this might have been a classic.The score, with a couple of exceptions, is mainly ho hum, and drags in places where it needs jazzing up. So if you want a more energetic and fun version I suggest as others have, get the Broadway Cast CD which has a lot more life to it."
2,"Yes, it's Lucy, but just barely.","Millie may have been thoroughly modern; Mollie may have been unsinkable; but Lucy, the great Lucy, the Lucy who was, arguably, the brightest comedic genius this country has yet produced, Lucy, our beloved Lucy, proved in one very long stretch of celluloid to be not only modern, er... up to date, but completely stoppable.She met her match, amazingly, in Jerry Herman's ""Mame"", that frothy song and dance fest that, in actuality, is much more difficult, much more subtle, than it seems. And it left Lucy in the dust, trying to figure out just what the Hell went wrong when she managed to make every other principal in the cast look brilliant by comparison. This was the movie that was to re-ignite Lucy's never-so-hot-in-the-fist-place movie career, but, instead, pounded the final nail in its' coffin.Could it actually be true the real genius in the family was that Cuban bongo player she had divorced a couple of years earlier?Hmmmmmmm."
2,Bad Casting/Poor recording,"The soundtrack to jerry Herman's Mame with Lucille Ball, Bea Arthur and Robert Preston is a recording for hard core Mame Fans only, and even they have to bite down hard to make it pallatable. Primarily due to the exceedingly poor soundtrack quality, this soundtrack is one of the poorest recordings I have ever heard! Lucille Ball is totally miscast as Mame, although she try's very hard. Beatrice Arthur is wonderful as on the B'way cast album w/ Angela Landsburry. Robert Preston is the one presence I actually had to have the disc for. I may copy them to another disc, so I don't have to put up with the rest of this dreadful recording, so full of noise you're looking for the noise reduction button!!!Not for the timid!"
2,"""Can't You See"" is edited down to 3 minutes",The original version is over 6 minutes. I bought this collection for that song. Very disappointing.
1,Disappointed,"I have volume 1 and I love it. So when I saw volume 2 I wanted it but when I say the songs, I was disappointed. Why do they need to repeat some songs? It's not like there isn't enough southern rock to go around. They could have done another CD with all different songs from volume 1. Whoever chose the songs for volume 2 should be fired.....along with the guy who chose the cover. Give me a break! Don't they think women love Souther Rock?"
5,"Great Music, just a complement to Volume 1!!","This album is a perfect folow-up to the first. You need to pURchase both the first AND second volumes to get all of the music on both of the CD's. The Platinum edition is also very good, but there were a lot of the songs missing that I wanted. So, hence the need to have both volumes, 1 & 2."
3,Goin' South Vol. 2,"Although the choice of artists was very good, the style of music not my favorite."
5,Marillion`s Best Epoque.....simply a masterpiece...,"Definitivamente, es la època de oro de esta tremenda banda...Musicalmente, poderosos....la voz de Fish incontenible...La letra de las canciones, insuperable...sòlo comparable a la faceta no comercial de Genesis en su mejor ciclo (hasta Seconds Out).....Conjunatmente con Misplaced Childhood, La Gazza Ladra y Made Again...lo mejor... Obviamente, el que tenga este CD serìa un bobo si lo presta.......This is the best epoque of Marillion...simply a masterpiece. Great music, Fish at his best....the lyrics...only you can compare this music with the non-commercial musical production of Genesis (until Seconds Out)....This CD with Misplaced Childhood, La Gazza Ladra and Made Again...Marillion at it`s best....You have to be a dummy if you let away this CD from your hands....."
5,Second Best Fish era CD,"""Sugar Mice"" and ""Warm Wet Circles"" are as goodas anying on ""Misplaced Childhood"", that beingthe great Fish era Marilion CD.Still lots to like here as I say. Tuneful andwith Fish's perceptive and elegant lyrics.Buy this one."
3,Voyage to the Island,"I decided to buy this book because I have family that still lives in St. Lucia. The book actually speaks about them. I found it to be enjoyable reading and very enlightening. The pictures are informative but nothing like a ""voyage to the island"" itself. It can be a bit slow but definitely a good book to read at least once. Hope you enjoy."
3,"Great book to start with, but not for beginners.",I found that the index is completely off. I went to look up editing a personal address book and the page took me to importing your personal address book. For a beginner this would be frustrating. The index says everything about a book.
4,A pretty good book if you are planning on fishing the Kenai.,"We need all the help we can get if we have never been there. I question the selection of tackle listed since they mostly use spinning rods but I guess, whatever floats your boat. I never use anything but a baitcasting outfit for salmon. It has been a while since I have read this but will review it before I leave."
4,This book helped me decide not to fish the Kenai river...,"This book did help me a lot. Reading about the crowds and ""Combat Fishing"" made me decide to spend the extra bucks for a fly in trip. I am glad I bought it as I think it saved me a disappointing trip. Yes, I would suggest you get a copy and read it before planning a trip to fish the road crossing of the Kenai river."
5,The BEST non-OEM manual EVER!,"This manual rivals the factory manual(s). It has superb wiring diagrams in COLOR! It is totally ""vehicle specific"", '04 to '06 Sportster ONLY. Very thorough data and explanations of diagonstic serial data bus systems. Directions on downloading trouble codes by the owner, circumventing the dealer ($$$).(Quite a surprise!) Totally thorough pictorials of virtually everything mechanical and electrical. This is the FIRST after market ""shop manual"" that is as informative as the factory manuals, accomplishing this mainly due to its SPECIFIC (one model) content. Not the usual ""fits-all-models"" manual. Totally blows away the average Chilton and / or Haynes manual, hands down. GO FOR IT ! !"
3,Some info not correct,First thing I looked up was how to change the oil in my 05 sporsterthe info was intirely wrong
4,Very Good Book,"My 8 year old is learning polish (her choice) and this book has really helped alot! Not only has it helped her but it has also helped my aunt who speaks mostly polish, with helping with her homework.It also includes alot of extras like numbers, months, and the pronunciation cz, wz and so on. I highly recommend if help is needed in either english or polish."
3,Expected more common words,"I purchased this dictionary because I had to write letters in Polish. I speak Polish; but, I have difficulty in reading and writing it. I found that the dictionary was lacking in quite a few Polish translations for common words."
3,Indestructable,"We bought this book simply because our teething son was eating through all the board books we had. This book cover has a soft, laminated sort of cover that our son could chew on and not destroy. As for learning his letters...the book only goes through about 5 +/- letters in the alphabet, so it is pretty pointless."
4,Nuclear Assault - 'Alive Again' (SPV),"Twelve tracks of top grade '80's classic trash by Nuclear Assault.I got to see the band awhile back and the only downside was there was a very poor turn out and the gig was cut a tad short.That's living proof that a lot of the really good music doesn't make it to the masses.Couldn't believe my ears when I heard they'd actually reunited after a lengthy seperation.You'll feel like you're PRACTICALLY near the mosh pit when you hear(make that experience) killer cuts like ""Brainwashed""(remember this video on Mtv?),""Critical Mass"",""Game Over"" and ""Trail Of Tears"".Who said that metal is dead in the 21st century?"
4,I was skeptical at first...,"I was skeptical at first but after purchasing and using for more than one month I am fine with the purchase. it does not leave white flakes; the hold is on the firm manageable side but if you blow dry right after putting on the gel it will hold the style better. It is a great buy for the cost and does not cause any allergies as well. Hailing from NYC, it passed the humidity and hustle and bustle test."
3,Oh Melinda,Well This book has been usefull in my understanding of what medical geography really is. It covers the differnet ways at looking at medical geography. I think it is a good basis to use in understanding. More detailed books on each separate section will lead to a greater understanding of the transmission and spread of disease and the way health services are provided.Over all Melinda and Robert it was a good book.
3,This is not a bad movie at all (if you like stoner movies...,"For fans of The Lunachicks, this movie features that band along with a lead role by sexy tattoo-covered singer Theo Kogan. Jason Mewes has a VERY SMALL part, so fans be warned! The story revolves around a briefcase of pot that is stolen and falls into the hands of several different New York City characters (dealers, mobsters, stoners and musicians). The main reason to see this movie would be Theo Kogan, as she shines in this one. And as for the reviewer who compares the amazing film Excalibur to Pot Luck and Flash Gordon? What!!? Flash Gordon was campy fun. John Boorman's 4 star Excalibur is a beautiful, stunning film that I find more entertaining than any of the 3 Lord Of The Rings. A classic in every sense (and the reviews were almost all stellar when it was originally released). I am truly baffled!"
1,Fromage,"This is a pretty bad movie. Suitable for Grade 12 viewers / stoners. Not extremely well made (the dialogue is buried a lot of the time) or well plotted (very contrived and silly storyline). There are no funny characters that make the movie watchable despite its awfulness (like in Little Nicky). The ending, while better than the ending for 'Mars Attacks' is still cheesy in the extreme."
5,"If you like Pot, you will love this movie!!!",I saw this movie when it was released theatrically . It is great. It has Jay from Jay and Silent Bob. It is really frikin funny too. I would recommend this title to anybody that has any sense of humour at all!!!
1,High Times should be ashamed,"This movie is horrible, the acting is contrived, the plot is looser than a crack (...), and there is enough cliche in this movie to make it an afterschool special. I don't know anyone who smokes and uses the word dude four or five times in a sentence. Why would high times use such cop out dialog? Were they making this movie for Pat Roberts or Tucker Carlson. High Times should be ashamed. Comedy is one thing, but this is as far from comedy as CURSED is from a horror film. Anyone who saw this pile of steaming crap will know what I am talking about. Not really too much to say about this film, except that just because a movie has pot in it certainly does not make it underground or cool. This movie is as underground and cool as Richard Nixon's meeting with Elvis."
4,Look To God To Meet Your Needs,"The central theme of ""Our Unmet Needs"" is that we should look to God to meet our needs instead of resorting to lies, manipulation, or disobedience.The title is around 250 pages and contains 16 chapters with such topics as:1. Reasons we experience delays in having our needs met.2. Getting into the right position to having our needs met.3. Looking at God's promises to meet our needs.4. Looking at our needs to belong, feel competent, and to feel worthy.5. Errors we face when we try to meet our needs in our own way.My personal favorite was the chapter on why we experience delays. Sometimes we are delayed because of our sin, God wants to teach us patience and trust in Him, He has something even better in store for us than what we are praying about, or some other reason.A good book and challenge to the reader to rely on God instead of self or others to meet our needs.Read and enjoy!"
5,If you want to face your own truth,I am now reading this book for the fourth time. I consult this book as much as I consult the Holy Bible. Why? Because this book forces me to tell and understand the truth about myself as well as the source of the problems that has created so many needs in my life. I highly recommend this book to any Christian who has reached a point in their walk with Christ where nothing but truth sets them free and apart from the world. Thank you Dr. Stanley for allowing the Lord to use you as a vessel to write such a glowing and thought provoking book. God Bless You!LAT from North Carolina
1,"Didn't receive the book, credit card has been adjusted","No rating, as I did not receive the book and seller failed to check to see if I had received item."
1,Keep searching,"I purchased this case for a Treo 680 and it appears to be built for another unit. It is far too large for the 680 in both the length and width. The phone just bounces around in the case so I returned it. You should try the Smartphone Experts P6 case for only $19.95, it fits perfect and is very high quality."
5,A revolutionary work in logic,"This book will change the way you think about logic. Koslow's reconstructs the entire field of logic -- from intuitionism to modality -- from the ground up, basing everything on a startlingly simple and elegant characterization of implication and the logical operators.A short review cannot do justice to the richness and utility of Koslow's results. If you are a logician or a philosopher of logic, and if you haven't read this book, then stop reading reviews, get a copy of STL, and spend the next month absorbing it. It will repay your effort."
4,The Gkids loved them!,I bought two for my two ggirls and they just adore them and they wash quite well!
3,"Taybodal, where are you?","The Taybodal mysteries were wonderful. The characters were rich and complex as were the mysteries. The stories were replete with cultural information about the Kiowa that was fascinating.Murder on the Red Cliff Rez appears to be the beginning of a new series. I found the humor in this book to be juvenile and the attitude toward the white characters to be racist. It seemed that all white people were ignorant and uninformed while all Native Americans were smart and well-versed in all skills necessary to survive in life. I did find the mystery to be excellent and engrossing, but the humor and one dimensional white characters definitely detracted from my enjoyment of the book.The use of the word, ""suppose"" instead of ""supposed"" was irritating and is something the editors should have caught.I will continue reading future novels produced by Medawar, but I hope she is able to overcome the failings of this first installment in what could be a successful series."
1,I gave up. Don't read it while eating.,"I gave up reading it. Very confusing writing (as mentioned by another reviewer.) What really made me quit were the regular yucky vulgar off-topic references that were supposed to be humorous. For example, I think we all know what happens when people walk dogs. If you do read it, don't read while eating."
5,"Wonderful Class, Wonderful Professor","Our friend from NYC has obviously never had the pleasure of education in Russian Cultures from Prof. Kalbouss himself. This energetic, intellectually stimulating, and wonderful individual has made Russian Culture interesting to literally thousands of students for over 30 years in the eduation arena. He has singlehandedly created the cultures course from scratch which is currently being utilized by universities all over the country. He has recently retired from teaching at The Ohio State University, but the impact he has made on the many who have enjoyed his class over the years, will likely not go unappreciated. Congratulations to George Kalbouss on the tireless contribution he has made to higher education! He will be missed."
3,Not the Worst,"This is certainly not the worst Science Fiction book. It may not win any awards, but the action is decent, the character development is so-so, and the story is mildly interesting. Octagon was the first Saberhagen book I read, and it made me think that I would like to read something else by him."
3,A letdown,"I was dissapointed after reading this one. I'm tempted to say I hate it, especially in comparison to number eight. Way too much of Skurai for my taste, and a lot of it brings out some of the more annoying traits in a lot of the charecters. I hope number ten is better because number nine was just plain mediocre. Though Fenris has some good moments in the begining of the book hehe ^_^"
3,Beams End good if you love sailing,"I love Errol Flynn so wanted to read his work, but it was too much sailing and fishing for my taste. He writes well, very conversational, as if you were right there sitting across the table and he were telling you stories. I liked one of his other books better, My Wicked, Wicked Ways just because it had more interesting stories to me. If you like outdoor stories, though, you will like it."
1,Not what was in the picture,I ordered what I thought looked like a bowl/plate. It was a plate. It didn't look like the picture. It was a different product. I was disappointed. It was too cheap to send back. Won't order from this company again.
3,wynn,Nice watch and great price.The blue color in the picture does not match the greyish blue color you actually get.
5,Big watch!,"It is a big and a nice watch! the only inconvenient: it's too heavy!I think it is recommended to men with big wrists, because it is really big and heavy!"
5,If you want a heavy watch...Nautica Men's N19509G,"This is the 2nd Nautica watch I own, it's almost identical to some of my Bulova watches. The keys on the right side are simple to use, adjusting date, time, stopwatch. I'm not completely comfortable yet purchasing a designer watch, but if it works & looks so well, why not buy it? My 1st Nautica is behaving perfectly after almost a year.I love Bulova, but Nautica runs a very close second especially for the money! I should mention it's a very heavy, large face. Not for the mild & meek, a true 'sport' watch. Only negative is I expected more of a blue hue on the face, not quite so dark, almost black. But that's a minor complaint, considering all the positives.Nautica Men's N19509G NST Chronograph Watch"
4,Very nice!,"Very nice watch. It's a lot larger in person than I expected, so make sure you note the measurements if you want to maintain a certain size. But I'm overall really pleased with the watch. It's a very nice quality and the functions work very smoothly."
5,Excellent Watch !,I've purchased this watch few months ago and I'm very pleased. It's a HEAVY and LARGE watch all made of steel and SOLID AS ROCK! It's a really beautiful watch and it keeps accurate time. It's certainly one of my favorites.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR THOSE WHO LIKES LARGE WATCHES.
5,ENCANTADA!!!,"Hola!!! Estaba buscándole un presente a mi novio por su cumpleaños, me decidí por este reloj!!! él al igual que sus amigos quedaron fascinados...Es súper ""pavo"" y Varonil!!!"
3,Picture looks better than the reality,"The watch looks better in the photo than it does in actuality. I like a large faced watch, and that it is, however it's not excessively big. The face is nice, the band is what cheapens it. I had a gift certificate for $50, so it only cost me about $72.00; for that price, I guess it's worth it, but I wouldn't pay more than $75.00 for this watch."
4,It's like having your own private duty nurse in your purse.,"As a surgeon, I recommend that all my patients just flip through it. The graphs, sidebars, and tables list and define normal laboratory and other test results. It explains anesthesia and other medications, as well as mapping what happens from admission to OR. This book has prevented many post-op complications. The medical dictionary in the back is worth the price, alone. My patients seem more motivated to heal because of this book."
2,Written as if by someone who needs to pay off a poker debt,"As someone who spent many years playing poker, this book left me feeling unsatisified. The writing could only be described as perfunctory, as if the author needed money in a hurry. Much better is ""Shut Up and Deal."" That book gave me an adrenalin rush that made we want to return to the felt table of my past."
2,For Poker Lovers Only,"I picked up this book expecting to read some insider information on the world of poker. Instead this book is an uneven collection of what appear to be articles from Mr. Bellin's portfolio. As a freelance writer for magazines the author has employed the same style of writing for this book. There are some good poker stories interspersed with some revelations about the author's life, mixed in with some explanations on mathematical probabilities. Poker Nation is lacking of any cohesive narrative, and this makes reading it a chore."
5,"Highly entertaining ... Like ""Word Freak"" applied to poker.","I highly enjoyed this book. It was very similar in style and concept to the excellent book about Scrabble called ""Word Freak"" by Stefan Fatsis which came out last year and which I strongly recommend. I thought that Mr. Bellis was a fine writer and that the book was consistently entertaining. It seemed as if some of the more negative reviews of this book came from regular poker players and/or those who have read many poker books (usually both undoubtedly). I don't consider myself in either of those two categories and so perhaps I came to the book somewhat more open-minded (and in less of a comparative mindset) than some. I did find that in some parts of the book, the poker lingo got so heavy that it was a bit difficult to follow the author's point, but that is a minor quibble. The book may not be for everyone, but I recommend it."
5,"A great book, not just a great poker book","I loved the hell out of this book. There's hundreds of books about poker out there (and I've read a lot of them) but this is not a how to book. This is more of a travelogue through a parellel world filled with unique characters and a memoir of an interesting person with interesting tales to tell. Yes, you'll learn something about the game of poker, some things not to do, others to watch for. But what makes this a great book is that you would enjoy it even if you had never played a game of poker before in your life. Andy Bellin is a great writer, and a great writer can write well on any subject. This is a book that stands on its own terms for its humor and economy of style. I think most readers will have a hard time putting it down."
4,Be Very Afraid,"This may be one of the best ""take a hard look in the mirror"" books ever written. After finishing the essays I handed the text to a friend whom I believe has a gambling problem. Some of the player profiles contained in the book are truly horrifying. In case you have any doubts about some of the people you are playing with in the card rooms, read this. The poker strategy is accurate and basic because the author gets to the point: no matter what the skill level, if you grind it out long enough, the game will get you. This is definitely not a ""how to"" manual. It most definitely is a great read for poker and gaming lovers. I highly recommend this book."
1,pokeraddict,"I love poker books and stories, but would have to say this one was average at best. If these are the best stories the author has to tell, that is sad. I have more interesting things happen to me and around me at a poker room in an average day than this guy has had in his life. If you are a beginner trying to learn the game, this book won't help. If you are an expert, it certainly won't. And if you are looking for something to entertain you while on the can or something, you better look elsewhere too. A very disappointing book by a rather poor writer."
4,A good read for traders aka gamblers,"I dont play poker at all. I picked this book up with the intent of improving my stock, currency and commodities trading under the premise that professional poker players and traders are two of a kind. Despite my ignorance of poker, I find this book a real page turner covering not only poker skills and tactics, but its addictive and even devastating effect on life of many poker players. It's very interesting and informative. The author's writing skill is excellent. No matter whether you like poker or not, if you are interested in reading fascinating stories, you will be very satisfied.p.s. As per whether it will help my trading, a little bit, I must say."
2,Disappointing!,"The book is mostly a collection of unrelated poker cliches & anecdotes that have been told many times before. What dissapointed me most was that based on the title, I expected more of a 'player's diary' if you will. It was far from it...in fact, there's nothing new here at all. Also, it seems to have been written for mass appeal rather than for players. If you play, skip this one but consider Jesse May's novel 'Shut up and Deal'; it's defintely worth a look."
2,"For that amazing Apocalyptica sound, but very unreliable",I use this on a regular basis. I have gone through several because every time I unplug the pickup it pulls the jack apart on the preamp. It can't be easily repaired. I have not found a workaround for this yet. I tried leaving the pickup plugged in all the time but that drains the battery and eventually your going to have to unplug it to replace the battery. I always have to order a new one when it breaks and this is very frustrating because of the price!!!
5,Dreams,I'm a close friend of the author and had the opportunity to read it before it was realeased to the public. Dreams was one of the best books I've ever read. I didn't put it down until it was finished.
5,Escape from your reality.......,This book was recommended to me by a friend. A good book to read in order to escape from your own daily issues. A romance that keeps you interested.
2,Dreams,"The story line was okay, the spelling and improper word usage was a lot to be desired. The author needs to find a different publisher/editor. Her work is good, the editing was horrible."
2,Dreams,The author needs to find a different publisher and editor. Hopefully one with spell checker. The very typical romance content was just that and with all the mis-spelled words and improper use of words I hardly found it worth the price.
4,Another Winner in the 6 Sisters Series,"Poor Annabelle!! She is young, vain and thinks herself desperately in love with Sylvester, her older sister Minerva's fiance. Her plan to marry the handsome Peter, Marquess of Brabington, who is Sylvester's best friend, is the premise for this charming second novel of Chesney's Six Sisters series. Chesney's comic characters and wry analyses of human foibles keep this story rolling along to a happy climax. The best fiction is when characters evolve and grow, and Chesney leads Annabelle on a merry chase before she matures into an admirable heroine."
3,A TIRESOME HEROINE,"I was getting very impatient with Annabelle been such a spoiled, immature, inconsiderate, and vicious 17-year old young miss through good half of the book. I kept hoping some of her better self would emerge, or have someone clobber her on the head instead, but none happened until the end. She really reminded me of the girl in the b & w movie ""The Bad Seed"". But once Annabelle got her comeuppance it was a great satisfaction indeed. Aside from the heroine's unattractive personality, I did enjoy the part about how Annabelle's father, the vicar, and the squire tried to track down the villain, I thought it was very lively written."
3,Six Sisters Part 2,The second book in the series was a fun read--more like summer reading by the lake or pool. But not of the same caliber as the MC Beaton books I'm used to reading.
3,The relavance of Judaic customs in the New Testament,"This book presents a nice, non-combative approach in trying to teach modern Christianity the relavance and wonderful symbolism found in the modern day Judaic customs. It even gives a practical guide for those who want to try these traditions themselves to have an instructional tradition for their descendants. I thought this book did a good job relating modern observance to New Testament times. I know that the next time I read the passages mentioned, I'll have a better understanding of the context surrounding the actions of Christ and the apostles. This book is very easy to read and structured for even the most elementary student of New Testament history."
5,Rewind,Excellent collection. Prompt service. Received and played in good condition.Can highly recommend it to any Don McLean lover.
2,Slow -,"Luke Wilson stars in the college comedy, Tenure. This is Blowtorch Entertainment's first original production. Mike Elton directs but need a little more pizazz in his pacing and emoting of the characters.Tenure is about Dr. Thurbur, a beleagured college professor who competes for tenure with a new colleague. She is a professor from Yale and very attractive. David Koechner co-stars as an anthropology professor. He is a sidekick that also has a ""Big Foot Club"".Luke Wilson could do so much more with his character, but was constrained throughout. ""Tenure"" has potential, but is a half-hearted try at comedy and romance."
3,I love Luke Wilson but...,"He has been in better movies then this. However, I just happen to be a Luke Wilson fan, so I'm glad I got this."
3,Solid comedy,"This was easy to watch. It's no Kentucky Fried Movie or Caddy Shack, but it's mildly funny and it makes more sense than many other comedies out there. It was w/o gratuitous language, sex or violence and I appreciate that.So many films are ruined by the immaturity and insecurity reflected by harsh language which doesn't belong, as well as gratuitous breasts or lovemaking scenes. This movie is pretty mellow. Not bad and definitely worth renting."
4,A slice of life that I can relate to.,"As a college professor who just recently got tenure, I can certainly relate to this film. For a comedy, it manages to deliver steady amusement rather than any real laughs. The film does an excellent job capturing the pressure (and self-introspection) of the tenure process, as well as, the absurdity of faculty politics. Luke Wilson is playing the same basic character we've seen before, but (even so) was a good choice for the lead. All in all, a good way to pass the time--especially for academics who don't take themselves too seriously."
5,Ruff Rider caps great for guitar players,This product is excellent for building and maintaining fingertip callouses for playing the guitar. It works for me.
5,works as advertised!,"I started learning guitar a couple of years ago and bought these shortly afterwards, along with the red gripmaster (medium I think) and I still use them. Yes, you can get the same results from playing more, but from a beginner's standpoint, this was a lot simpler. I kept my gripmaster with me and whenever I had a spare moment I picked it up. My fingers had a much harder time before I started using these regularly. They come off easily if you want to use your gripmaster without them, but honestly I just leave 'em on. I am currently taking a class on bluegrass banjo and I have recommended these to some of the other folks in my class."
5,A must-have for guitarists,"I just finished praising the hand exerciser up and down to the best of my ability... and I also love this ruff rider attachment. It slips right on to the finger exerciser, fits it perfectly and is a big help in building calluses, and also in maintaining calluses in the even a person is going away on a vacation or for some reason can't play the guitar as much for a period of time. It works great, calluses built fairly fast with this one. I use it a lot, in the beginning I could only stand it for a short amount of time, but I kept going back after my fingers stopped hurting, doing only a few short reps at a time and now I can hardly feel it at all.Anyway... great tool for guitarists, I wish I had known about it soon, I won't hesitate to recommend this to fellow guitarists, regardless of what level they are :)"
3,Stephen Malkmus is quite good on this,"Like most records endorsed by Sonic Youth, this is too long, mind-numbingly loud and annoyingly avant garde. The high-point of the album is by far the ironic, high-pitched stylings of Stephen Malkmus. During the last 1/4 of the album I found myself wishing it was already over and wondering if I would be evicted for listening to it. Overall, I recommend this for a good time with your family."
1,Confusing & False Advertising,"I have only read a little bit of this book, but from the very beginning it is very confusing. Also, it seems to have many typographical errors.At the beginning of the book there is a ""Warning-Disclaimer"" which states, in part, ""there may be mistakes, both typographical and in content."" At the end of the Warning-Disclaimer, it states in bold letters, ""If you do not wish to be bound by the above, you may return this book to the publisher, in marketable condition, for a full refund.""I called the publisher about this. The author himself, Jeff Allen, answered the phone. I said that I wanted to return it in accordance with the Warning-Disclaimer, but he absolutely refused.I feel that this book is DEFINITELY NOT FOR BEGINNERS and contains what you could more or less call FALSE ADVERTISING."
1,Author can't write!,"I think there is some good info on swing dancing in this book... somewhere. Unfortunately, the writing and organization are so bad that I found the book worthless. Before I return the book and get my money back, I will write this review and maybe save some potential buyers.There are alot of positive reviews that don't mention the horrible writing -- they are probably friends of the author doing him a favor. The writing is so bad it is absurd (how did it get published?) You will reread a sentence 5 times and still have no idea what it means. Don't waste your money. If you do, save the reciept."
1,How'd this guy get major release?,"Out of L.A. and away from his team ""The Shapeshifters"", Hip-hopperAwol One has released yet another fairly mediocre addition to theunderground. I'm sorry but the best thing on this album is the beatsand they're only average. His voice is just dry, somewhat raspy, andunmotivated almost always coming off sounding melancholy. The mannever really rhymes I almost took some quotes of close attempts atrhymes but he's just never really saying anything witty, deep, or ofmuch interest. I'd definitely say the best songs here are those withguest vocals."
4,REALLY FUN GAME,"Im one of those people that when u see behind the STARWARS(NDS) box and look at the pictures and scenes from the game im like "" this game looks boring with terrible graphics! y would they bother making an NDS if everything is going to be the same as GBA.I thought about trading in my ds for a psp. then i got the game with my graduation money because there wuz not too many choices or the other games didnt look fun. i started playin the game on the way home and i wuz hooked on the game for the past few days. it wuz too much fun.if u r a fan of star wars in general you'll luv this game. the only bad thing is that it was too easy. but other than that the game has the origanl STARWARS music by John Williams. i beat the entire game already and unlocked all the ships. so the sound is dynamic as well as the sound effects. I would recomend this game to STARWARS fans."
4,"Some corners cut, overall a good game.","The single player mode is an arcade-style type. The faces are more like over exaggerated cartoons than the real faces. It is a 2D plane (right moves the character forward through the ""hallway"", up moves the charcter to the characters left in the ""hallway,"" etc.) It's best feature is the Multi- Player. it had the classic 3D arcade feel (just like the game in the arcades where u sit in the chair and u have one joystick) u can face off against classic characters and new characters, like luke skywalker, anakin skywalker, han solo, darth vader, and unlock ships such has the x wing, vader's ty fighter, the millenium falcon (o ya, once u unlock those ships, u can use them against ur friends and completly own *Hint* get the millenium falcon. its the best ship. i beat solo with the x wing) if ur friends are getting this, get it for its multiplayer!!"
2,"OK, I guess","The hardcore star wars fans might be dissapointed. It is nothing like ps2 or x box versions. I beat it in 2 hours. It was fun but way to short for me. Also the Graphics were worse than gameboy. There was almost no use for the touch screen :( . The star fighter missions and freeplay was the best part of the game. Oh, and you need 2 cards to play multi playerOveral:Graphics=5/10story=7/10music=9/10Multiplayer 9/10Overall=7/10I don't recomend wasting your money on ths game"
1,SNES Graphics,"Need I say much more? This game is so pathetic looking its almost sad. Theres no use for the touch screen! Why must these movies make DS games of their GBA games and add pathetic touch screen activities. 3rd party movie licensed studios can't even make 3D DS games, but they do PSP. Pathetic. The DS can do close to the PSP, but NOBODY PUSHES IT! I swear the best done so far was the Super Mario 64 DS game. C'mon people, even EGM gave it a horrible ratin'!"
1,old nintendo,this game looks like a game from the very first nintendo platform or maybe super nintendo did not like it at all
1,"""Hate this game I do""","This game was not really that great. I mean come on what kind of game is this? I thought it was going to be one of my favorite games but it wasn't! If you want the real game buy the Xbox or PS2 games for ""Revenge Of the Sith"". The PS2 game has fantastic graphics and great moves and it also follows the story very well. I have actully played the game and it honestly is not that great! The PS2 game is also alot easier than this one. In the PS2 game you can unlock bonus missions and duel characters. The PS2 game is alot lot better than this one! The PS2 game RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,messa saya dis bombbad game,"I got this game hopeing it would be fun because it was starwars ,i was really wrong! when you block an attack it still hurts you. the graphics are pretty darn bad. on padawan diffuculty it still feels really hard.the starwars games for other systems are a load better"
2,"don't buy it , burn it from somone that has it.","Freechild is the only good song on this album. The other songs are either ok or really [bad]. If the group did the rest of the songs the same way they did ""freechild"". This cd would be great. Don't buy it. Burn it from a friend on a blank cd, the songs you like from it."
5,Don't Miss This Album!,"This is just one of those albums that gets better every time I listen to it. I was never fortunate enough to see them live, even though I lived in Providence, RI during their tenure. MusT is one of the most underated prog-rock bands ever. Hell they ARE THE MOST UNDERATED ROCK BAND EVER! Any body who is a fan of rock and roll needs to own this record!!! Anyone who is ""new"" to rock music needs to own this record!!! Any body who owns this must share this with (or buy it for) their freinds, family and any person who will take the time to listen! It has such amazing range and depth, it's a crying shame that they don't have more for us. Oh well, I guess it's just one of those crazy once in a life time deals. Pity..."
4,broke the mold,"great album!!! so many great and varied songs on here! if you were lucky enough to live in the Boston area at the time, and witnessed their amazing live show, you *must* agree we lost out when they left! a songwriter with something to say...a live show that gets you movin'...talented musicians!!!""Rust"" and ""Moving On"" clearly the best tracks...""One Night Stand"" also good (better live)."
3,Gifts of Pride and Love -,If you are interested or want more information on Cradleboards this book is very helpful. Many wonderful pictures of cradleboards and personal stories.
3,Would have liked better maps and descriptions,Great guide but to help find the locations make sure you take a detailed map like Delorme or Coleman Atlas for specific forest roads and locations. The maps in this are VERY general. I liked the fact that camp altitudes are included. This can make a differance if snow or heat is expected and a major factor when I chose.
2,OUTDATED INFO,"I have been using this book for the last 4 summers and have found it to have a lot of outdated information. We are fulltiming in our motorhome and this book is fine if you are in a smaller rv or tenting. Some campgrounds have closed from fires, closed from budget cuts or have been remodeled. The length limits are usually incorrect too. I want to know if I'm driving on a dirt road to the campground (how many miles in)or if it's paved. Is there water available? and if so are the faucets threaded, handpumps, or non-threaded where you need a water thief? Dump stations with potable water? What is the length and width of the site. Are there tight turns or dead ends with no turn arounds? What are the directions turn by turn and mileage? I thought I was in campground hell trying to get really good information until I found this website: [...]Check it out, you won't be sorry...AND they do offer books & CD's on ALL of the National Forest Service Campgrounds in the United States. Happy Travels..."
4,Careful!,"This is a GREAT BOOK for campers who prefer national forest campsites, with two ""gotcha""'s.One, remember that the latest version is copyrighted 2003, and many campgrounds have closed. I used the internet to mark the still-active campgrounds and estimate that at least 30 percent are no longer listed in the various national forests' lists.Two, there are occasional errors in the gps coordinates. Even so, the coordinates are great to have.My recommendation? Grab one now. the book is out of print."
3,Not terribly Impressed,"This book is good for people in very small vans or tenting. It's not up-to-date, and it's very expensive for the information in it, and not so good for rver's. That said, when I can find something usable, it's good to have. A friend swears by it, therefore I purchased. At a lower price, I'd probably have liked it better - very expensive and not so easy to use."
5,Fantastic Watch,"By far the best timepiece I have ever owned. The watch is beautiful and functional. I have received many compliments on it, including from the jeweler who sized it for me."
2,Unacceptable.,"Finally purchased this watch about a week ago. One problem: The day wheel has been installed too closely and the actual days (the black paint) has been scraped off of the dial, which resulted in very small pieces of debris were found under the watch face.I returned this item promptly. The only plus side is that the return was easy and Amazon customer service was helpful.If there is any discrepancy with the return I'll be sure to change my rating to 1 star.--------------------******UPDATE********Thank god Amazon customer service is on point. I was reimbursed 100% (including shipping) and customer service was easy to deal with.I would advise anyone buying this watch to do a CAREFUL inspection of it prior to keeping it -- Go to a watch specialist and let them take a look at it for (1) authenticity and (2) movement"
4,phat watch,"i like this timepiece very much, my first expensive jewelry purchase as a college grad lol. One thing that is noticeable with the CAF1111 is that there are some that are a hundred more and a hundred less. The more expensive ones have th ba803 band, which is brushed and polished compared to this one, which is only just brushed. thus im gonna have to get my watch touched up every now and then since it scratches easily, but as long as they are not deep ones, its not a big deal. but thats my 2 cents. and props to TAG for making such a sporty but classy watch"
4,Good Product - scratches easily,I love this watch - it looks absolutely fantastic. The only problem that i have with it is that it scratches very easily. I had scratch marks on my watch the first day i wore it from my work desk. I have been wearing Seiko for over 3 years now and couldnt find a single scratch on that watch.
1,Is it real?,"This is the mail I received from TAG Heuer:""TAG Heuer does not sell its timepieces on Amazon.com.Consequently we are not able to identify the origin of these products, but for sure they have not been brought there by TAG Heuer.They may be counterfeits, second hand products, stolen watches, and in any case products of the grey / black market, not supplied by TAG Heuer and not under our guarantee.I can only recommend you not to buy TAG Heuer products there, but only in authorized dealers""Regards!!"
5,Odie is the true star here!,"This book obviously focuses on Odie completely. In every comic strip on every page the dim-witted dog in a variable situation (whether he's being insulted by Garfield, or striking back at Garfield, or being his own dumb self). And in one strip, we get to see the ""True"" Odie . . . shocking! I love every minute of this. A must-read for all Garfield and Odie fans."
4,Grim and realistic slice of life,"Widowed Polish immigrant mother Jadwiga hasn't got a chance. To support herself and her two beloved children, Andrew and Caroline, she works hellish hours at the most menial and demeaning jobs. While Jadwiga scrubs, her children are constantly in peril, but while Andrew narrowly escapes street crime and a murderous pedophile, and the lovely Caroline finds out being a kept woman isn't all that glamorous, they seem to be doing all right... until.... Jan has actually combined two different novels, originally set in different time periods, fairly seamlessly here to tell a continually moving and compelling story. He has also re-created the world of his own youth--- the people, the places, the bleakness and the unexpected joys. His lyrical evocations of character and situation made for a novel I had trouble putting down. I finally just sat up half the night and finished it."
1,TOO scary for toddlers,"My 4 year old son was so excited to watch this movie, but at the very end for about 10 minutes there is a very scary to him monster dream train part. After seeing it just once and trying to fast forward during the scary part he has refused to watch it again. It makes me so mad they have to put scary monsters into children movies!!"
2,Beware,"My 3yr old was scared of this movie , so if you have a child under the age of 5 I would be cautious ."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE,"I purchsed this video for my grandson, age 2 1/2, because it is an old favorite story and it had a 'G' rating. His mother is a teacher and will not allow him to watch it. The remake is very poorly done. It is scarry and should not be rated ""G"". The little boy get's bullied, which is unnecessary and ridiculus and some of the trains are scarry. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY. This movie should not have a ""G"" rating. It is scarry to young toddlers and children."
5,2yr Old Loved It! No problem with Scary parts,"I gave this movie 5 stars because my kid loves it. We first watched it on netflix and he loved it so much i went out and bought it. It has absolutely no problem the Nightmare Train. Their are villains in every kid movie and this no is no different. He isn't anymore scarier than any other villain. I don't understand why people are having trouble with the bullying part of this movie. It is apart of life and school. In the movie the train teaches the little boy to stick up for himself. My point is this movie isn't anymore scary than 101 Dalmatian, where they want to kidnap puppy's and skin them to make a fur coats. If your kid is overly sensitive and a cry baby than i would avoid this."
5,Great for grandkids,Our grandchildren (5 and 2) saw this on TV and loved it so I order the Little Engine That Could for Christmas. They have watched it several times already.
3,Cheese-a-rific!!!,"The singing, the voices, the premise all very cheesy but my 3 year old loves it. I was shocked at how dark and scary the scenes were when the Nightmare Train was introduced. Sheesh, that train kind of scared me but it didn't bother my child."
1,Too scary for my 4 year old,There is a character called the Nightmare engine. This character and scene is too intense and frightening for young children. I've never seen my son so upset from watching a rated G movie before. We will not be watching it ever again. Don't waste your money purchasing this for your preschoolers. This movie does not warrant a G rating. Parental guidance is suggested.
4,Little Engine Movie,"Cute little movie for kids. Some scary parts for younger kids (2-3 yr olds), but great movie overall. Lots of singing through out the movie. Fun characters and storyline."
1,Not for younger children!!!,"This movie seems harmless...until the nightmare train shows up in the middle of it! My son talked about the ""scary train"" forever after watching this and I fast-forwarded through that part. A good story ruined by something that did not have to be included in the storyline!!!very dissapointing!!!"
2,My son loves it...I loathe it.,"As almost all of the 1-star reviews have mentioned, there is an inordinate amount of scary material in this movie that may not sit well with younger viewers. I'm not talking about a-hunter-kills-Bambi's-mother-which-results-in-dialogue-about-death, or a-scary-fish-eats-Nemo's-mother-and-sibling's type of scary. More like a fire-shooting-out-of-its-eyeballs-while-it-debases-you type of scary, as with the ""Nightmare Train."" My son (2.5 years old) is amazing unfazed by this and would watch this movie back to back all day long if I let him, but it doesn't sit well with me (and as a parents I'm not particularly hypersensitive about things like this) for G-rated material. I would burn this thing in a fire if my son didn't love it so much. Just know what you're getting into if you pick this one out for your train-loving child."
1,Thanks for giving my son nightmares,"My 3 year old son who loves trains watched this movie yesterday. We're going on two nights in a row where he wakes up screaming and has to sleep in our room, and this is a boy who doesn't scare easily. Who are the cartoon creators that think toddlers need a little supernatural fear in their lives?"
4,This movie is fine...,"Our son is three years old and he loves the movie, and watched it over and over. We didn't return it to the store because he enjoyed it so much.As for the 'nightmare' train, uh...our little guys loved it. Perhaps if people didn't shelter their kids from everything, they wouldn't be scared of something in a 'G' rated movie. Just my opinion, and to each his own. But to give a movie poor reviews because of one thing is silly. It's a harmless, fun, children's movie - unless you like to keep your kid in a bubble and protect them from everything."
4,surprisingly good,"I really loathed this movie when we first watched it. The illustrations are very CGI, the story is cliche. But my kids loved it, so we bought it as a gift for them. I gotta say, it's growing on me. The song at the beginning is especially cute. The nightmare train part is not so scary that my kids get scared watching it (which IS the case with so many of the Disney movies... my daughter still talks about Ursula the sea witch stealing her voice). And it's got the lesson about determination, trying your best, etc."
2,A little Scary for small children,"I put this movie in for my two year old son to watch and was a little concerned about the scary parts. I admit that I did not watch it with him, I could only hear the scary train. I started to play it again at a later time and he said NO, NO, NO, NO! I played it again later and watched his body language during the scary part and his hands were clinched and his face looked terrified. I am going to wait a few years before I introduce it again. He is still in his formative years and will better be able to process fear and handle it when he is a little more mature. I figure there is enough fear to deal with in life I certainly don't need to add any via a movie."
5,A Great Family Movie!,"I think I can, I think I can... recommend this. This movie should be in every family's collection. My family loves it!"
1,This Movie is too scary for young children,"I agree with the other reviewers that wrote that this movie is too scary for young children. My 4 year old son cried hysterically when I put him to bed last night because he was afraid of the ""Nightmare Train"". Even this morning he said he was still thinking about the Nightmare Train and feeling scared. We hadn't seen the movie in two days at this point too, so it clearly made an impression. It's unfortunate because he had seen a preview for the movie and was asking me to rent it. So I thought he would be thrilled to watch it but no. Never again."
1,Ugh...I wish I'd read the reviews,"I really wish I hadn't let my kids watch this movie. My 3-yr-old has never cried like that at a movie and my 6-year-old keeps talking about the ""night train"" and how scared he is now and that we need to tell the people at the library about this so they know this scary thing is in their movie. Most kids who are interested in seeing this movie will be Thomas Tank-engine aged which is pretty darn young. Kids at this age still can't distinguish well enough between fantasy and reality, so I don't believe it's a good idea to show them such frightening images."
2,Multiple Bad CDs in a spindle,By FAR the largest number of Bad CDs of all the spindles I've ever bought.
4,We need a new Edition . . . Steven and Seymour!,Looking at the last updated edition to Graphic Style and that was in 2000 and the one before that was 1988 . . . it is about time for a new installment to this never-ending story.
5,Satisfied Customer,The book was an enjoyable read accompanied by many images. I would recommend this for anyone who is in a graphic design history class.
3,Three stars,"I'm using this book as a college text.. I believe that I have a rather high reading level, but at times this book can be difficult to keep along with. Nonetheless, there is certainly a wealth of information here! Pages and pages of relevant artwork and explanations, along with the key people within each movement covered."
2,"Nice concept, crummy reality","My two-year-old wants to play this - the keyboard looks so fun - but the games are either way below or way above his level. He either gets bored with the simple ""type in a key"" games or frustrated with the mouse. The mouse pad is way too small and is hard to control, especially for someone not used to using a mouse.The concept is very cute and I wish this turned out to be better than it did. I'm very disappointed."
2,Leapfrog laptop,"LeapFrog Clickstart My First ComputerI gave this as a Christmas gift to my nephew and it did not have any games loaded, though the description is that it comes with 4 basic games. What an instant disappointment! Wish the website was more descriptive that you need to buy games to go with it."
3,"Good idea, mediocre games","I was really excited to give this to my 3yr old for Christmas. He has been very interested recently in computers and this seemed like the perfect way to introduce him to how to correctly use a computer. The pre-loaded games are somewhat effective at teaching keyboard and mouse usage and actually seem pretty fun. However, the add-on [...] games are a total ripoff. We bought the Cars game for Christmas morning, but for [...] the cartridge only has 4 games. The games were marginally educational, but each one only take a minute or 2 to play and since there are only 4, the cartridge is outrageously priced. I am happy to spend [...] on a game, but it needs to provide enjoyment for more then a couple of minutes. I think some better games would make the click start worth the money, but until then, I wish we had just stuck with nick jr online."
5,for my 5-year-old,"Very good. I bought this for my 5-year-old son. He loves this computer and I love it too. My other kids play with it as well. It is very educational. I love the built-in games. I love the graphics and I love the educational content. I bought this because of the other reviews I read. They all had 5 stars on all of the websites I went to and I would have to agree. You can usually find the games on sale at a lot of stores, so it's not too expensive."
4,3 year old loves this!,"We got the Clickstart for our 3 year old for his birthday, and a few games for Christmas (a week later). He LOVES it! He hasn't shown much interest in using a computer yet, so I thought this would be a good way to get him familiar with a mouse and keyboard. The games that come pre-loaded on the Clickstart were a hit. He loves playing with Scout (the dog that is featured) and the the ABC Tree is a very basic beginner activity to familiarize him with the keyboard and teaching letters. There are not many options for additional cartridges, but so far he has really enjoyed the ones he has. Other reviewers have complained about lack of activities on each cartridge, but my son seems to be content with the selection. It is all fairly basic skills, so I'm sure it wont be long before he is ready for a real PC. But for the price it was a great investment and I recommend it for 3 year olds!"
3,Not the best toy from Leap Frog.,I don't recommend this one. We have many Leap Frog toys and this was one of the least interesting ones for my kids. They played with it for about a week then lost interest. The Leapster was a favored toy and they played that one for years. Pass on this.
2,Loved it for about 6 months!,"Our son received this toy when he was about 3. He loved it. Learned how to use it very quickly. It is a great educational tool and teaches kids computer skills at a young age without potential damage to your own computer! We were very pleased with it. As far as functionality and educational value we liked it more than any other educational toy he has had, including Leapster 2, Tag, and Tag Junior. Then one day it stopped working. It lasted about 6 months. Our son is unusually careful with his toys, and we put it back on the shelf under the TV after each use, so there was no damage to the device. This was very disappointing. Considered buying another one, but why waste the money?"
2,"Great Idea, bad design! Disappointed","I recently bought this toy because I want my 3 yr old daughter to not use my laptop, also for her to also get accustommed to using a mouse and key board. The Idea of this toy is amazing.However, upon first use the mouse will not work as it should it will sit at the right hand corner and not move, therefore all the games involving the mouse are useless. Unfortunately we live in the caribbean, so returning it is not an option, I have also bought one for a friend's daughter, I am so afraid to now give her a gift that may not work.I have ordered the electrical plug to see if that may make a difference by chance..keeping my fingers crossed that I may not have bought a worthless toy because the reviews are great from other parents and my daughter looks forward to want to use it every day after school...such a disappointment!"
3,Sleep mode / keyboard OFF issues,"While the main console is OFF, I found that pushing the RESET button under the keyboard for 5-10 seconds seemed to help make the keyboard turn OFF and go into SLEEP mode more frequently. I still agree that the keyboard should just have an OFF switch, and that removal of the batteries is NOT a reasonable solution to turning the keyboard OFF. It makes one wonder if the designers are in cahoots with the battery companies."
5,Love this thing,I bought this in October for my 3 year old son who constantly wanted to play on our computer. I bought it hoping he would settle for this and learn computer skills at the same time. He constantly wants to play with it and can be a bit rough with it some times but I see no problems with it yet. It feels like it will hold up for quite some time. I like that I was able to choose a skill level and that the game advances him as it goes. He will play it anywhere between 30 min to an hour at a time and I haven't had to replace the batteries. We loved it so much that I bought my 4 year old niece one for her birthday.
1,Frustrating and Disappointing,"My daughter got this toy as a present. We used it twice before giving it to good-will because it was just so frustrating to use.It uses a very primitive infrared technology to connect the ""computer"" to the tv. We had to use several books to prop up the reader so it would line up properly. The slightest moment would cause the game to loose connection with the tv. The game would freeze and we'd have to fight with it all over again to get it to line up, take the game out, and restart it. Because of this the your child cannot be left to work independently. Very frustrating for a young child."
1,Eats battery and mouse is difficult to use.,"The keyboard unit does not have an off switch and it constantly polls looking for the control unit. We turned it on for the first time and used for about 15 minutes. When we came back to it the next evening it was dead.I like the games, but the mouse is difficult to use and when the batteries are dying works irratically and is frustrating for my little one."
3,Enjoyable!,My grandson who is 3.5 years old is somewhat reluctant because of the hardship in using the mouse. The mouse is the only drawback and prevents younger children from using this product with ease.
3,"Okay, but could be better.",The kids like it but grow tired of it fast. There isn't a big selection of games to choose from. The graphics are okay but could be better.
2,Not very durable,I bought my 3yr. old one for christmas and she has used it only a handful of times and now she dropped and not hard at all just fell off of a box to the floor and now I can't get it to work at all. Nothing comes on so I look at it as 59.00 for nothing and I think it was a waste of my money.
5,My Daughter Loves It!,My daughter just got this for Christmas and she absolutely loves it! She has been interested in playing with mommies computer for some time now and I am so glad she has her own that she can learn the basic skills on. She actually sat down and played with it for over an hour and would have stayed on it had it not been bed time. Very happy to see her play with something and be proud of herself when she does something right and learning at the same time. We have the Dora game which is her favorite so far and the Animal Art Studio one which is pretty fun also. Can't wait to get more of the games!I would highly recommend this to the parents of children in the 2-5 age range!
2,Mouse is junk,"I bought mine for my 3 yr old directly from Leapfrog's site. My daughter enjoyed the games, but it didn't keep her interest long. She got more and more frustrated as she used it because the mouse is terrible and does not work well. It would have been nice if it had a real jack plug in for a real mouse, instead of a play one. The mouse pointer freezes and won't move. Even after restarting it, it is frozen and doesn't work. Now all the games we've bought are worthless, and can't be used anymore. I did like that it was a real QWERTY keyboard and she learned eye hand mousing coordination while it lasted."
1,Worst of all worlds,"My daughter got this for her 4th birthday. She LOVES to play the games. On the other hand, the system is awful and the mouse regularly completely stops working. So she gets soooo frustrated! It's the worst possible combination-- a toy that she really, really wants to play that doesn't work. It's not like mouse technology is new. In this day and age, it should not be hard for a company to make a mouse system that works!"
2,"OK, but not great...expected more","I had higher expecations of this product. This is the 2nd one we have purchased -- returned the 1st one since it did not work at all. The 2nd one works, but the game cartriges do not work when inserted into the box. The mouse is a bit stickey which is very frustrating since itis hard enough to teach the concept of a mouse to a 2 year old. I do really like the paint game for mouse skills...."
4,Engaging and fun for my 3 year old,"I got this for my daughter, along with the Cars, Disney Princess and Finding Nemo games. Some of the games are difficult for my daughter to do yet, like the Beauty and the Beast game and my daughter has a hard time grasping the concept of the arrow keys for some reason, but she loves most of the games. Some games are very educational, others are not. Unfortunately, the one she finds the most amusing right now, where she washes the cars is not one of the more educational ones."
2,Not made well..broken mouse and connector,"I bought one of these for my daughter last year. The first one didn't work right out of the box. The connector was faulty and there was no picture. I returned it right away the next and exhanged it for an identical model.The second one worked well for about a day or two and then the mouse stopped working. No reason for it. My daughter was always supervised, because she didn't get how to do it and first. She enjoyed it for the few days it worked.Overall pretty irritated that 2 were pieces of junk within 1 week. Didn't even return the second cause i didn't want to drive 45 mins back to the store again.Robin"
3,Wish this was made better.,"I ignored the reviews that commented on the mouse that only worked 1/2 of the time. I was excited to see the box at the door, and my 3 year old was excited to be able to use her ""new computer.""What a mistake - If you have a child that tends to be impatient, or expects things to work the right way (doesn't everyone!?) don't waste your money. The idea is great, but the mouse (which you have to use for more than 1/2 the games) really does only work 1/2 the time.My daughter got so frustrated, she refused to continue playing, and was really upset. It made me mad, because I had really looked forward to her having this new toy.Looking for something that is made better .... hope there is such a thing!"
2,TOO EASY!!!,This was kind of a waste of money. Purchased for my son's 4rth birthday. This toy really should be labeled as 2 years to 4 years. My son mastered all the games the first time he played. They were pretty lame and way too easy for a 4 year old. What 4 year old can't count to 10 and recognize the alphabet? I also purchased the Nemo game and that was too easy also. This would have been a great gift for my son when he turned 2 and even 3 but I would not purchase for a child older than that.
3,"FUN, but 1st one didn't work!","My 3 and 1/2 yr old daughter LOVES this computer. But the first one we bought from Amazon was broken - the mouse wouldn't work properly, then it stopped working altogether. We struggled though all the ""troubleshooting"" for days. Finally, needing to return it - I couldn't return it through Amazon! I recommend buying this product from a place you can easily return it, if you get a faulty one.We bought another one at a local store and it works perfectly and my daughter loves it!"
3,Games,I got the leapfrog clickstart for my 5 and 2 year old girls. So far they have only played the games that came with the system but are not interested at all. I am going to buy one extra game and see how that works.
1,Horrible Design,"The keyboard doesn't turn off. The light under the mouse is always on, leading to a quick drain of the batteries. It never goes in ""sleep mode"" either. I would understand if an A/C adaptor was sold for the keyboard and not only the console, as this would be a wise way for Leapfrog to make money. Unfortunately, there is no adaptor, so you must by four AA batteries every week, or try to explain to your three-year old that she needs to play with something else.Anyone who writes a positive review without mentioning this obvious failure in the product's design is a fake."
4,Could have paid less at Target,"I recently bought this for a xmas gift at the price of $45 - normally priced at $60. Only a week or 2 later, Target had this same gift on sale for $40 plus you could use their toybook coupon of $10 making the final price $30. Needless to say I was disappointed that I jumped on this deal too soon to only realize I could have gotten a better deal elsewhere. Oh well, you win some, you lose some.Shipping was fast and the product looks great - just wish I could have saved myself the extra $15."
3,Very low quality video and sound,"We got this for our 2.5 year old son for Christmas and while he's interested in the games, there are two things about it that really annoy me:1) Very low resolution and very low bitrate sound: my Commodore 64 from the 80's had better video and sound. Seriously - even from across the room the graphics still look blocky. And the audio is so bad you can barely understand the words they are saying (something like 16kbit/sec or so). For $50 I didn't expect XBox360 or PS3 level graphics and audio, but seriously in the 21st century the bar should be a little higher.2) Small mousepad and short mouse cable. The only way my son can move the mouse around is by using a book or piece of wood instead of the tiny little mousepad attached to the keyboard. Unfortunately the cord is so short, even this becomes a problem."
5,Happy Grandparents,"We bought LeapFrog ClickStart My First computer for our 3 year old grandson. We allowed him to open it after he had played with his other toys. He LOVES it!! He mastered the mouse within 30 minutes and as a result knows how to use the mouse on my computer. The games keeps him engaged and allow him to have fun while learning. We are pleased that he is continuing learning while having fun. I read the reviews on Amazon.Com before purchasing and knew to buy the adapter, so no surprises for me. I highly recommend this educational toy."
2,We now own our THIRD Clickstart!!!,"I bought this for my daughter 2 years ago for Christmas. Within 9 months the thing just wouldn't work anymore! It wouldn't turn on and off using the button on the unit, it was just stay on anytime the adapter was plugged in. Then I would just get a white and black screen, with AND without cartridges! The great Target in my area decide to let us exchange it, just for it to do the EXACT same thing about 4 months later!!! So on Black Friday, and after my daughter pleads, I bought a new one for 19.99. Looking at the keyboard it appears it has some upgrades (on/off button) so HOPEFULLY they fixed whatever is causing it to completely break down!!"
3,really rudimentary games for the price,"While my 3 year old does enjoy the Leapfrog Clickstart, another reviewer summed up my impression perfectly-1993 technology today. Especially for the retail prices at stores such as Walmart(about $25 for a single game cartridge), these games are very basic and rudimentary, both in terms of graphics and overall challenge of the games. Yes, there is an educational component to the games, but this is presented in such a basic format as to be mastered by a child in a short amount of time. Soon, the ""education"" becomes more the result of pure repetition than of any sort of challenge.If I had to offer a comparison, I would say the graphics are reminiscent of the original Nintendo and the complexity of the games themselves are barely above an Atari 2600. I can only assume the cost of the game is to pay the licensing fees to Disney and other name-brand characters because it sure isn't for cutting edge programming."
2,Not impressed,"This has not been a good product for my 3/4 year old. The games leave much to be desired and the mouse is a PAIN. He prefers educational games that we can find online and this did not make him want to use our laptop less (which I thought it would do). Frustrating to use, low quality games, I do not recommend this product."
4,Just CHANGE the batteries!!!,"We experienced all the same issues as those unfavorable reviewers and ALL our issues were eliminated when we CHANGED THE BATTERIES!!I admit, I have never encountered another electronic toy that responds to low battery power like this. I absolutely thought the toy was defective but, as it turned out, new batteries were all it needed."
2,Doesn't last,"My daughter got this toy for Christmas 2008 and loved it. We played with it maybe once a week and now it won't power up. We have tried new batteries, a DC-10 plug and cleaning the system, but nothing works; it has been dead for a month now. When I got on their website I looked up warranty information and LEAP FROG only guarantees the product for 3 months! We loved the toy but are extremely disappointed in the lack of quality and assurance from LF."
2,Not that impressive,My son got this as a Christmas gift when he was three and a half years of age. The games were too easy to master and there are not enough of them. The games that can be purchased to go with it do not increase in difficulty. I would not recommend this for any preschooler. This will not keep their attention for very long and the games are expensive for the length of time they would be able to use them. I returned mine back to Amazon. I hope you all have better luck with yours then we did.
2,This is way over rated,We bought this for our daughters last Christmas. The games that this comes with and the games you can buy for Clickstart are very poor. There are much much better games online for free that you can have your child play with. My kids (4 and 2) quickly lost interest in Clickstart.Please don't waste your money.
2,Don't bother,"This toy is a piece of garbage. We've had nothing but problems since our 3 year old got it for Xmas this year. The keyboard must be aligned exactly with the box or the sensors won't connect and the cursor won't move on the screen. Our daughter is constantly frustrated because the cursor freezes all the time. The cord on the mouse is too short and quite stiff, so the mouse wants to flip off the keyboard. She easily mastered the two games that she got with it (Dora and Nemo). I would definitely pass on this toy and choose something more durable with more games"
3,Stopped working after having it for a year,I purchased this for my daughter for christmas 2010 along with a few games. Out of all of her game consoles this was her favorite but just recently the battery light came on and didn't turn off even after purchasing new batteries then the power button shut off and it won't turn back on which of course really upset my daughter but she loved it while it worked. Unless you can purchase it new at a cheaper price don't waste your money as it will more then likely break down and cause major disapointment.
4,Great educational value with one major design flaw,"This computer has great value in teaching preschoolers the essential keyboarding and mouse skills in a safe way. You don't have to worry about your kids clicking all around on your own computer and damaging it in the process.There is one major design flaw in my opinion though: There is no on/off switch. And although the computer does ""sleep"" after some time, the mouse and keyboard are still using batteries, those red lights are always on. And while I definitely recommend buying the optional plug, you still need a set of AA batteries for the keyboard. I learned after going through two sets of batteries in about one week, that I should remove the batteries and insert them again each time we want to use it again. Not too convenient considering you have to unscrew thebattery cover all the while your impatient preschooler is waiting.That said it is a great toy."
3,leap frog clickstart,"This is a wonderful and educational toy. our experience was unfortunate and probably rare - one of the keys did not work. However, I have not lost confidence in this brand."
5,Excellent Starter Computer!!!,"Picked up 2 of these for children ages 3 & 4, both took to them immediately. Excellent ""starter"" to teach computer & keyboard skills while not sacrificing fun."
1,Censorship at it's worst.,"My child's name is Cassandra. Nicknames: Cassie & Cass.The Leapfrog company won't allow her to spell her own name on this keyboard because her name contains the letters a--s--s...I've tried calling them over 20 times ever since Christmas and they refuse to explain to me why they are censoring words on this keyboard and deciding for parents what their children can and cannot spell.I can honestly say, this is the most ridiculous toy I've ever purchased. They've eliminated thousands of words from the English language by blocking such letter combinations. How dare they???I'm going to return it. In the meantime, if anyone has any suggestions on a toy we can buy our kids that helps them with their typing skills, I'd love to hear about it."
2,Some things to consider before you purchase,"First of all, in my opinion, the games for this system are great and my preschooler loves them. BUT I would not recommend this system for the following reasons:- The mouse is very awkward and doesn't work well in a child's hand. My son gets frustrated with it, which is a problem since most of the games require the mouse, not the keyboard.- I was highly disappointed to find that a power supply was not included with the system. You have to buy it separately, which was not disclosed on the box. It takes 4 C batteries, and it goes through them very quickly. For the price, a power supply should have been included.- I have a difficult time finding games for it. Target doesn't carry them at all. Walmart only has a few. And they're not cheap.Overall, I don't think this system is worth the cost. I wish I had done my research and purchased something different."
4,Leap Frog Click Start My First Computer,"My granddaughter loves the Leap Frog Click Start ""My First Computer"". But, she just turned four years old, and it is recommended for ages 4-6. She quickly went through level one and level two. I think they should lower the age recommendation because, although she still enjoys playing the games, she is not learning and is sometimes bored with it because she is not challenged. The games need to progress with the child in the age groups recommended, and there should be more games available."
5,good toy but....,"this toy looks like it is really great when working properly....The mouse doesn't work on the one we have...well, it works, just not on the little mouse pad that comes with it, you have to put it on your leg for it to work????? other than that it is great!"
4,Great gift,"We got this for our almost 3 year old granddaughter and she loves it. She is able to use it with no difficulty at all. The set up was easy and she is able to turn it off and on by herself. The games hold her attention and the mouse and keyboard are easy for little fingers to manipulate. Her 5 year old sister plays with it occasionally, but it is really below her level.I took one star off since the adapter is sold separately. I think that is silly and inconvenient. Just stick the adapter in the box and up the price a little bit. Otherwise I am very pleased with the purchase and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good starter computer game for younger children."
4,Love it when it works!,"My daughter got this toy for Christmas and absolutely loves the games and activities. The problem is that the mouse sticks and it is so frustrating for a three year old when she's trying to play her game and suddenly the mouse just decides not to work.After pushing a few buttons and clicking a few times it seems to start up again, but it hasn't even been a week. I read reviews about this happening before I bought it, but didn't imagine it would be within the first week. My daughter has not been abusive to the toy at all, but when it stops working she just gets up and tells me it's broken (just today it ""broke"" about 5 times) so she's losing interest not because it's not educational and fun, but because she's getting frustrated with the poor performance of the mouse."
3,Strength Training,"Having osteroporosis myself, this tape shows you an easy way to start the strength training process. The tape is self explanitory and shows you step by step how to do the weight bearing exercises your body needs."
1,Not worth my money,"Now and again we buy useless products, and this was definitely a waste of my money. Geared towards the elderly (80-90 years old)."
1,SLOW - ONLY FOR BEGINNERS,"This might be a good video for an older person who is just beginning exercise. It is definitely not for baby boomers who want to strengten their bones, and are in good shape. While the instructor is clear, and the exercises are very easy, it moves too slowly for someone who wants more strenuous exercises. I was very disappointed by the background music, and repetitive instructions. If you already have knowledge of osteoporosis, and are in good physical condition, I don't suggest you purchase this tape because you will be disappointed."
1,skeletal fitness by mirabi,Skeletal Fitness by Mirabai Holland - Osteoporosis Prevention Bone Loading and Strength Training Exercises:A Workout For BonesIf you have any exercise experience don't purchase this item. It is more for seniors who have have been sedentary their whole lives. It's really slow with exercises that are way to easy. If you're looking for something that will give you a good work out this is not the product for you.
3,Good start to some basic bone exercises,"Mirabai Holland provides a good introduction to some basic bone building exercises for those that are just starting out. When you have weak bones exercise done wrong can actually cause fractures, so I wanted a simple introduction that would help me to understand what type of exercises I would be safe with and also start to build bone with. For that purpose, this exercise video was adequate. The pace is slow, the instructions are simple and it's easy to follow. If you are looking for something beyond the basics I recommend you look for a more advanced video."
5,Fabulous,Skeletal Fitness by Mirabai Holland has been a great help to me. I was diagnosed with Osteoporosis several months ago. I was told I had to be careful the way I positioned my body doing exercise. Mirabai Holland starts the DVD with loads of information regarding Osteoporosis and body alignment. Her workout is easy to follow yet you can work as hard as you want. As you learn the exercise you can do more reps and add weights. I found this one of the best exercise DVDs I have purchased. After going through the workout I feel stronger and limber. I highly recommend this exercise for woman. Prevent Osteoporosis! I wish I started these exercises years ago to prevent the disease. Now that I have Osteoporois I hope to hault it before it gets worse.
5,Excellent DVD to Help Your Bones,"I have used this exercise program for a few years now. To make it easier to manage my time, I do the upper body workout one day, the lower body the next and then skip a day. This workout is complete and covers every area of the body that is prone to fractures. The program uses weights, resistance and isometrics to challenge the bones in different ways. It starts with a short warm up and ends with a stretching and relaxing section. I like that you can go directly to any of these sections on the DVD from the menu. You can feel that the exercises are challengng you but I think anyone can do them. Mirabai guides you every step of the way with hints, reminding you to breathe and encouraging you. She is a very pleasant instructor and easy to follow. I know that my time is well spent in doing something positive for my bones."
1,JUST FOR BEGINNERS,"I was VERY DISAPPOINTED after watching this video. It was very boring, and while I got a couple tips on how to strengthen the hips and back, I would have a hard time watching and listening to it more than once. The background music, and instructors voice almost put me to sleep. There was lots of information about osteoporosis which seemed repetitive in the beginning. The exercises moved slowly, and the instructor used a towel which seemed very cumbersome, instead of bands for strengthening and stretching.This might be a good video for beginners, but what about boomers who have exercised and are trying to find the motivation to maintain their strength? I wanted a video that would inspire me, but this one only put me to sleep. I'll take a couple exercises from it, find my own music, and send it off to my grandmother."
3,"In part good, in part not so much","Mixed review, let's get that at the top. On the good side, the weight (arm and ankle) exercises are very good for anyone with this issue (anyone with bones actually.) BUT the warm up is weak, and the pace slow. The quality of shoot, it is true--amateur. And sadly, as a DVD you can't pick and choose, like DVDs do now. To design your own choices. So you spend time with the zapper. Plus, yes, it looks like it was shot in 1986. Maybe it was?Overall, if you only exercise at home and you have osteopenia (or more), try it. It works things my other 20 something DVDs don't."
2,Sorely disappointed.,"This little gadget looked great. It had all the features I wanted. But those good looks were only on paper. I use these big flash drives to carry document files and music, as well as record lectures and discussions. Of the 5 computers I use regularly, this drive was only recognized by one of them. I had to send it back as unusable and got the GlorEE 1gb drive instead (at half the cost). These drives are made in Germany, so when I emailed the service department for assistance in getting it to work with my other 4 computers, it took 2 weeks to get a response and then it was in German. Not helpful at all. So, save the bucks and get the less expensive model, which has all the same features, but is a shade bigger and uses a AA battery instead of a AAA."
2,Not As Good As It Looks,"This software requires many ""upgrades"" at additional cost - to get it to function the way most people would want it to function. Spend more and get something that's ready to go out of the box."
4,Atlanta Spirit,Ms Jones provides a wonderful voice for the Atlanta Spirit. I live in Ohio but have spend many summers and holidays in Georgia because my parents were born in this state. My brother moved to Atlanta and it has a wonderful spirit with the West End community she describes perfectly. She allows me to visit through her eyes and develops characters that you feel that you know intimately. The ability to weave a tell that creates a feeling of familiarity of the community and an understanding of the characters is a gift of a great writer. I have read all of Ms Jones' books and find her to refreshing and creative. I am looking forward to her next novel.
5,Truth or Consequences,"If you like J. California Cooper, Dorothy West, Nikki Giovanni and Pearl Cleage then you will love the writings of Tayari Jones. ""The Untelling"" examines the consequences of the choices we make (and the ones that we have no control over) in life through the main character -Aria Jackson. Jones' poignant prose weaves a story of Aria's denial to herself and to the man that she loves thus altering their lives forever. In a subtle way, Jones also examines class in the African American community. The characters exemplify that the African American community is not monolithic, as some would have us to believe. Jones is the sculptor and words are her clay. This is not a formula book, so if you are in the market for something different try ""The Untelling""."
3,Pretty Good,"I know this is off the subject, but the author's photo in the back is impressive. I like the profile shot and I love her hairstyle. Now onto the book: Ariadne is the story of a woman who lost her baby sister, her father, and is determined to not lose her one love left: her boyfriend. Living in a really bad neighborhood with a quirky, high class friend, she struggles with the single life and her family's past. I didn't like Ariadne as a person because of her spiteful, immature, jealous ways but I despised her psychotic mother even more. I know sometimes the characters that readers don't like make the most interesting ones, but it was hard to feel sorry for her or even connect with her because she was so petty to me. On the other hand, I was a big fan of Dwayne and I agreed with everything he did (minus the toy gun ideas). His presence made the book pleasing to read. Jones has the same amiable sense of dialogue, character, and plot path to make very odd (and morbid) stories interesting."
5,Best TV i've owned to date.,"I did several months of research and comparisons before pulling the trigger and spending 4 grand on a TV. But it was well worth it. This Mitsubishi has the best picture and features of everything that I looked at. My only complaint is that after spending that money, my wife felt she had to go out and match me dollar for dollar for the wall entertainment center to put it in."
1,unreliable,"Does it not seem strange that the reviews posted here are either ***** or *?In 16 months, my WD65831 broke down twice. Customer Support routed me through an Indian office. Fine, let 'em make a buck. But I consider this TV to have been a mistake on my part. There's nothing special about the picture, and there's really nothing special about the hardware. The thermostat failed at month 11, the lamp at month 16."
1,"Don't buy this - lousy picture quality, not worth the money","I actually won mine in a raffle, and replaced my 12 year old Panasonic 32"" tube TV with it. What a mistake. I was expecting a huge improvement in my DVD playback, since I could finally take advantage of the Progressive Scan output of my DVD player. I spent hours playing around with different settings, trying to get an image as sharp and clean as I used to get on my tube TV. But DLP projection technology isn't capable of it. The image is terrible. Lot of grain, noise and ghosting, and way too many motion artifacts. I'm glad I didn't pay money for this, but I wish I'd simply donated it back to the charity I got it from. So my advice is, don't buy this. And if you're seriously considering it, go find one in a store somewhere and bring in some of your own DVDs to see for yourself."
5,"""new"" camcorder",The battery we bought for our old camcorder makes it like new again. We hated to throw it out so you came to the rescue.
5,Works as well as I expected,"The battery is a perfect fit, and though smaller than I thought, seems to have enough power for my needs. We used it for about 30 minutes of highly active recording over the holiday weekend, and the battery meter never moved from full. Very pleased with it."
2,"Quaility problems, again","I have owned camcorder Duracell batteries for more than 15 years. All were made in USA and gave superior performance.This battery gave no indication of losing power until 15 seconds before my daughter was to recieve her diploma. I think ""made in China"" has struck again."
3,"Beautiful book, but one MAJOR flaw","This is a great book. It has beautiful illustrations, very clear and helpful. It also has maps on each page showing where the snake lives. One minor problem, it uses a lot of technical terms like ""Fossorial"" and ""Riparian"". But (I discovered after my fourth trip to the dictionary) it has a glossary in the back.However, one major problem. There is no clear indication which snakes are poisonous, which are a little dangerous to humans, and which are harmless. This is a big drawback. I want to know without having to read through the text for a clue if the snake that just entered my tent is going to kill me or not. Some of the time it doesn't tell you even in the text, as in some of the rattlesnakes. Of course, you assume that rattlers are not exactly friendly, but a clear symbol or icon would really help. So would a section letting you know what to do if you've been bitten by a snake."
2,Not very exiting.,"I have an image of Spenser from reading the books - that of a big guy with an 18 inch neck, 50 inch chest and 18 inch arms. Very strong and above all, very physical. Joe Mantegna is a good actor but (for me) just does not cut it as Spenser. He is just not big enough! Robert B. Parker himself, plays 'Ives' in one scene and it is clear to me that he based Spenser (at least physically) upon himself - although he denies this. Sheik Mahumud-Bey is too nice to be Hawk whom I see as menacing but articulate. Casting aside, the story was slow and quite frankly boring. By the time it ended I did not care what happened to the characters. It was treated as more of a love story between Spenser and Susan than a detective story."
1,No hope for UK Parker fans.,This film is not available in a format compatible with uk systems. So we Spenser fans in the UK must go unsatisfied.
3,A little short of what I expected.,"Masters Press Baseball Crosswords Volume 3 fell short of my expectations. I thought the book would have puzzles about baseball and the players of the past and present with stories mixed in. The book is made for the younger crowds ages 8 to 15.While the puzzles are of good quality, they lack any real challenge and often they are there could be more clues. Each puzzle does talk about a major league team; provide you with basic information about the team and a listing of leaders over the past ten years.I do like the idea that each team is given an exclusive puzzle. I also like the stories, but I fell that the author could have given each team it's own book. Also there is nothing about past players and for a baseball purest this is a major disappointment.Price in the right range, this book would and will make an excellent gift for the young, aspiring ball player in your family. Overall the book is good, but definite improvements can be made."
5,One of the best rockabilly albums ever,"The first time I heard Bayou Country right after it's release inJanuary 1969, it blew me away. This was truly a unique soundthat captured the imagination of practically every kid who had a guitaror even the slightest interest in starting a garage rock band.From the haunting, opening E7th chord salvos in ""Born on theBayou"" to one of the staples of 60's/70's pop, ""Proud Mary""and ending with the catchy, rhythmic ""Keep on Chooglin' "", this album continues to amaze me how it still grabs the musical psyche.Creedence took the San Fran. rock style of the late 60's and made it a little more palatable to the main stream.The grooves on side one of my original vinyl have worn through to side two. This album still remains close to my heartas a favorite, and one that helps recapture a long-squandered youth."
4,Possibly their best album,"Bayou Country was the first huge break through for CCR. Technically they only had on single that was popular, but two of their very best songs appear on this collection. Every group has a break through album and this is theirs.Proud Mary is of course one of the top R&R; songs ever recorded and has been covered by numerous artists including Tina Turner.This album also had Born on the Bayou, which to this day is my favorite CCR song of all times.This is one of the classic albums of R&R; and belongs in any library."
3,Chock full of excellent writing.,"When Mallory Tolgarth's father died penniless, she went from popular young lady to governess to help support her mother and sister. After her first successful engagement, Mallory is hired to prepare the Portman twins for adulthood and their Season. When she finally meets their older brother, Charles Portman, Mallory falls slowly in love. But her hopes are dashed when Charles brings his spoiled, beautiful fiance to the country. Mallory tries to ignore her heart, but she exchanges emotional glances with Charles that seem to indicate shared feelings.Inventive tale filled with vibrant descriptions and rich emotions. Very well done and engrossing, Clark has a winner in this Regency romance. Mallory, the twins, and the Portman staff are all fully fleshed out characters."
2,Would be great if they fixed the drive belt motor issue,"I love this machine when it's working, but I just snapped my SECOND drive belt motor shaft this morning. The drum was barely touching the wood, taking very light passes, and...clunk. Time to call Grizzly to see what we can do about this."
2,Some major flaws,"The machine requiers a 25 amp 110 outlet minimum. Most 110 outlets are rated for 20 amps max.You have to be very careful not to take off to much material or you will stall the machine and trip a breaker.1-16th could be to much.The depth gage is not acurate. I believe the machine would benifit from 220 power.The 2 inch dust port is to small.I made mine 4 inches and it works alot better. I also installed a 30 amp breaker and wired a 25 foot 10 gage cord to, again alot better, but it still seems under powered.For the price its not bad.If you have room spend a little more and buy a bigger machine."
1,Buyer Beware,"Grizzly has an ad in Woodworker's Journal that advertises these being made in Taiwan. I don't own one and never will knowing its manufactured there, I'd rather buy American."
1,Everyone knows that God is an Englishman!,"Stand back, everyone...stand back and be enlightened on how great a country we English have and how we beat the ""anti-Christ,"" Napoleon! Rory Muir's portrait of the war and how great was his country, amounts to nothing more than marching in lock-step with a legion of fellow English writers who are hell-bent on a never-ending agenda of attempting to portray their long-disappeared Empire as the ""saviour"" of Western Europe. The whole exercise smacked of something that was originally intended to be published in a magazine that caters to the selected audience to which the message is crafted."
1,Music Lover,THis band sucks. I bought it based off of what i heard in the samples and was very much disapointed in what i heard once i got it. There is no rock and no good rapping. It is obvious that this band has no freaking idea about what they are doing. Don't buy it it sucks.
4,Good but buy it from an authorized dealer,"Everything is cool ... great watch, but the paint of the pieces on the outside are falling apart and Amazon does not cover this."
5,"Awesome, lens into a forgotten world","I've been researching my family's geneology for the past 20 years, and I've read many books trying to get a sense of what life was really like for the familes living in late 19th century, early 20th century Galicia. This book took me back to a place and time when the fabric of Jewish life was full, vibrant and deep with family connectivity and traditions. Shtetl Memoirs truly gave me that lens into the past history of our people. I learned so much about the customs, the daily routines, the towns, temples, language, and family traditions for bar mitzvah, wedding, and other happenings of daily life. I love this book and owe a huge debt to the author Joachim Schoenfeld.Shtetl Memoirs: Jewish Life in Galicia Under the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Reborn Poland, 1898-1939"
4,inside look,"I am glad I had the opportunity to read this book. It tells it from the standpoint of those who participated directly in the invasion. The participants share their thoughts and emotions. They describe their many months in prison.I found the book particularly valuable as a look back at the political situation in the U.S. House and Senate. Senators and Representatives are quoted during the negotiations to free the hostage Brigade members.I think it pays to read several sources when trying to get to the ""truth"" of a political situation.I'm glad I could hear the voices of the Brigade members."
2,No More Games,The movie was not entertaining and it was also a low budget. I only bought it b/c of Ray Lavender.
1,The Pleasures scent is less than pleasurable,"I love all the Pleasures scents ... except this. It is too heavy and has a scent that gives me a headache. Maybe it smells like this on me, but I do not like it at all."
5,Una Noche Festiva,This Berlin Philharmonic Waldbuhne concert from 2001 has almost everything you could desire in Spanish music (Falla's El Amor Brujo and Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez would have been nice if there were no time constraints). Placido Domingo was the genial host and conductor/singer. Puerto Rican soprano Ana Maria Martinez was terrific and Korean-American violinist Sarah Chang played a hot violin.The orchestra played two of my favorite works: Chabrier's Espana and Rimsky-Korsakov's Capriccio Espanol.This DVD provided 102 minutes of pure pleasure. I can't wait until Latin American Night comes out (11/17/09).
5,This was a first!,She is beautiful and amazing! My husband brought it home from the libraryand played it over and over and over. First time he had ever done that withany CD. I bought it for him for Christmas.
5,love this book,"This book has given me so many useful and non-time consuming development games to play with baby. Because it is organized by age, it does not require a huge time commitment to read before it is useful. I invested in several for baby showers! It has proven to be a great gift."
2,There are better books,"I use my Gymboree Play book more often than this one, which may be because it doesn't have any pictures. I wasn't inspired by any of the activities."
2,"Not unique, unless you've NEVER been around kids","I bought this book because I was running out of things to do with my 2-month old. It seemed like we were singing the same songs, etc.But I was disappointed. This book is a collection of things you are probably already doing with your baby! It really didn't provide any unique 'games' to play with my baby. I guess it might be good for someone who has NEVER been around kids which is why I gave it 2/5. Also, it was easy to read."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"If you have half a brain, you can come up with these ""games"" on your own. What a waste of money and time! The brilliant ideas in this book include singing to your baby, telling your baby you love him/her, showing the baby how to roll over, and other completely common sense ideas. You don't need a book to tell you how to do these things. Buy the Gymboree book instead if you are looking for creative games and ideas."
2,are you kidding?,"This book is a waste of money. Most of the ""games"" that they suggest are so OBVIOUS you'd have to be a complete idiot not to figure these things out on your own. And in that case you have bigger problems than how to entertain your baby. One such ""game"" goes as follows, 'say things like good night sweet baby or rest, rest, rest your little head'. Are you serious? Gee, I don't think I would have thought of that all on my own. What I want to know is who are all these people that are giving it such a high rating? Well, I guess anyone can be a parent."
2,2-stage thrower,"I have not yet used the Snow Fox that arrived today, but was disappointed when reading the directions. Amazon's guide to choosing a snow thrower had a link to the 2-stage throwers that can be used on gravel driveways. When following this link, the Snow Fox was one of those listed. Now that I have purchased it, I see it should not have been included under the heading of 2-stage throwers and should not be used on gravel. Disappointing."
2,Not up to par,In a recent storm we received about two inches of snow. I found in using my machine that it barely threw the snow more than an inch or two. It was even worse when I tried to throw the snow to either side. I expected the the machine to throw the snow at least six inches or more. I don't know how the machine will handle five or six inches of snow.
2,You get what you pay for..,It is adequate for the price but you would have to pay morefor something that will take care of big snows.
4,Better than Shoveling,"I purchased the Snow Fox yard machine for my husband for christmas. We have used it twice and we think it works very good as long as you throw the snow straight. Does not throw well to the sides.Just finished cleaning 10 inches of snow. Had to take half swipes due to the deep snow, but, I think it will work very well with snow up to 6 inches.I would recommend this to my friends."
5,Very Impressive Machine,"Washington, DC this winter has had the highest snowfall since snowfall records began in 1884. After the first storm on 12/18/09, and reading all the reviews, I bought the Yard Machine through Amazon.com. Since 12/18 we have had two other significant snow falls, and I can't say enough about this little guy. It has saved my back. I live in a townhouse second from the end unit. With the Yard Machine I cleared my single car driveway and sidewalk plus two other townhomes in addition to a single family home with a 4 cars long driveway and sidewalk with snow as thick as 14"" (with two swipes). I'm 52 years old, and after all that I energy to do more. It handles so easily, a twelve or thirteen year old child could use it. I can't understand why local hardware stores don't carry them in stock. No gas or oil to mess with. You just need an long extension cord. I recommended it to all my neighbors, coworkers, and friends."
2,Yard Machines Snow Fox,"This product is good for only lighter snow (weight and depth). It can not throw snow to either side very far, or high enough to keep it from falling back into its own path. As mentioned in other reviews, the side dicharge adjustment is limited(45 degrees left or right). It can however, throw ""light"" snow a good distance(20FT approx.) straight ahead. The unit is light weight and the electric motor is quiet running. If I had to do it over again, I would have selected a more powerful snow thrower that could handle heavier snow."
5,It does the job!,"I just received my snow fox yesterday and, like many others, the box was in pieces. However, since the machine was not damaged I could care less what the box looks like. I cleared my 400 square foot deck in about 15 minutes. It throws the snow very well but will not work with hard crust, but then, it never claimed to. If you want to move some snow, this is the machine to do it with. It is quiet and efficient."
3,SHORT CORD MINDER,"Item received in jig time and in good condition. No snow yet so can't say how it works. Problem with item was that it did not have the Cord Retention Device mounted on the machine or even included in the box. I have sent a letter to the seller and now waiting for answer from them. I can hardly wait for it to snow.UPDATE:Works fine for light snow only, wet snow bogs down machine. Great for small areas only, broom works as well.Got cord retention device."
4,Does a good job for the size,"The fact that this is electric powered appealed to me because I wouldn't have to mess around with gas cans, but dragging an extension cord around is kind of a pain. This did extremely well in light, powdered snow at one or two inches. Unfortunately we were having some pretty heavy snowstorms and my neighbors laughed at me because it was like trying to cook a Thanksgiving dinner in a Susie Homemaker Oven... not too effective! But if you keep on top of the snowfall, this is a perfect, economical alternative to shoveling. The machine is light, easy to use, and doesn't take up much storage space, and performs as advertised and expected. But do call a snowplow for the heavy days!"
1,It works until the time I can't return it,"It looks as a descent machine and did its job 3~ 4 times. Even though I always have the trouble to start it (I need to push the button and lift and loose the bar to start it), I did figure out start it 5 times. But just after the 5th time after I finished the job. I can't start it any more. The expiration data is Jan 31,11 and it is dead in Feb 2,11. What a good design."
4,"The ""key"" to getting this machine to start.","Not sure how to rate this. Have had lots of trouble starting it up, but when it runs it does a decent job for a small & lightweight machine. Apparently, the problem was with the 2 plastic keys that came with it. It will not start at all with one of the keys. It will start SOME of the time with the other key -as long as the key is facing a certain way (the keys are identical on both sides). Incredibly frustrating as you can imagine. I called up the company and they had no explanation. So I went to their web site and decided to purchase 2 replacement keys (very cheap). Guess what? The machine now starts up EVERY time as long as I use either of the replacement keys (no matter how they are facing). Also, the keys that came with the machine were very hard to remove - there were several times when I thought they would never come out. But the replacement keys come out with no trouble.I know that this is hard to believe, but it's true!!"
4,Solid performance in a small package,"My wife and I have a fairly long, paved driveway by most North American ""suburban"" standards. However, we weren't willing to shell out $400 for some of the large, gas powered snow machines. This machine does a perfectly nice job.Pros:- No gasoline needed- Easy to operate and quick startup- Lightweight enough for my 10 year old daughter to run- It will handle snow much deeper than the ""recommended"" height if you go slowCons:- You need to manage the electric cord- Snow is not thrown very far (this can be good or bad actually)- Narrow swath compared to gas models- Mostly plastic parts (however this is a good thing if you run over the electric cord...trust me)Unless you absolutely need a wider and heftier snow thrower, this performed very well during a snowy Chicago winter. The big plus for us was saving back strain for my wife. We would generally work on the driveway together, and it worked great."
1,MDT does not stand behind their warranty,"Purchased a MTD snow thrower and in two weeks the auger started to crack. After two more uses the crack developed into a two inch C shape tear. An auger should not be made of flexible plastic. The operator's manual states the machine has a two year warranty. I contacted MTD to get a replacement part and they stated I had to go through a repair dealer to correct the defect. The dealer after repairing the machine told me I would have to pay for the repair because MTD does not warranty this part. I contacted MTD, the technician told me it is my tough luck they do not cover the part. DO NOT PURCHASE MTD snow throwers, they are made so cheaply and do not stand behind their product."
1,disappointing,We only used this item twice in about 3 inches of snow and it kept shutting itself off. The auger that throws the snow seems very tight and hard to turn. It would only work for about 15 minutes and shut down. I think we must have received a defective product bacause all the reviews I read before making this purchase were excellent.I had difficulty getting customer service help. I was given different phone numbers to try. We've had this item for 35 days. We have to drop it off for repair at a store that will service it in the next town over. Very inconvenient and dissapointing. We made this purchase to make life easier for my husband with back problems. Now its one more project to do.
3,Buy now pay later,"I purchased the MTD Snowfox for light amounts of snow. It works well handling several inches of snow. I have owned it for one season, and had to order parts from MTD Parts Direct - a new ""scraper bar"" $24, and new ""auger"" $46, and $15 for shipping.Expect to order a replacement scraper bar rather soon as the soft plastic wears down easily on cement. The unit will begin to leave a thin layer of snow as it passes over the ground. If you let this go too long, you will wear down the auger as well, limiting effective snowthrowing and causing vibration. It will take about 1/2 hour and basic tools to replace both."
4,Good for small areas,"My driveway is only 20 feet, so this thrower is perfect: no matter where I am on the driveway it throws way on the street side so I do not have to double-handle the snow. It really can not through far to the side and clogs very quickly with heavy wet snow that's more than 6"". I did however used it for 12"" light snow clean out and it did great. Also, it is very light, so you can use it in hard to reach areas where traditional, heavy gas-propelled throwers can't get. If you have a small driveway or want to keep it for the backyard, it is the right tool!!!"
3,It's a decent mix...,"... but it is plagued by terrible recording quality at around track 9 and up. I bought this CD new and I heard a few skips and volume irregularities towards the middle and latter half of the compilation. It's not too terribly distracting, but the QC for these things was non-existent when they were pressed since those sound flaws are really obvious.Buyer beware."
2,dull music for dull listeners,There's nothing truly bad about this music it's just that the songs are as predictable as their titles suggest. I think Eleanor should get out more and try and write about something except having her heart broken. And surprise us by learning some new chords.
5,Direct Mail A to Z,"Some people can do the same thing for 20 years, and all this means is they have one year of experience, twenty times. Benson, on the other hand, made each day's experience worth a lifetime of wisdom.He gives you all this wisdom on a silver platter, here inside his book. If you use direct mail, it isn't possible for you not to either learn something, or pick up some good tid-bits for you to use in your next project.Brilliant stuff, for sure."
5,I Have a New Favorite CD,This is by far the best CD in my collection (of many!) Its amazing that this is the work of one person. I am in awe. Cathy's talent will take your breath away.
1,It is not what I expected,This book is short on sound homiletical principle and short on theological principle. It does very little in addressing the real context of the SOM.
5,Flying the Hump in 2011!,"I purchased this book because of the reviews for a 90 year old friend who flew the Hump. He called me to say he had been ""flying the Hump"" the last two nights as he read it since it put him back to that time it was so accurate. I've never heard him so excited about something but he couldn't put the book down! I'm very pleased he liked it so much so can't wait for him to finish so I can read it!"
3,Not as high quality as you'd like.,"I have this and it works fine, is large and stores a lot. But the wood is VERY easily scratched and the stain is very thinly applied. When the it scratches it shows up very clearly in natural wood color. For $200 and with a name like Reed and Barton I expected much better quality wood finish."
4,Excellent travelogue among Armenians,"... It is really the best yet on travelling among Armenians. Mr. Marsden has a talent for juxtaposing different images through the English language and also through selecting visual adjectives in describing the Armenian character, history and the genocide. I enjoyed this book much more than Michael Arlen's which I had trouble really getting into. Mr. Marsden is honest in his reaction and description of Armenanians -- his repulsion and attraction alike. I recommend this book for anyone wishing to understand the disaspora, the genocide, the Armenian people and their tie to their land."
4,Good!,"A wonderful story of a Journey not only in Armenia, but of the road there. His knowledge of history and people allow him to well place stories and observations within the book, and illuminate the world of Armenians across the globe. Too bad it's unavailable..."
1,One shot wonder,"I loved this thing at first. Software installed fast, and the interface is intuitive, but I'm a digital artist, and I have hundreds of large image files that I need to backup on a regular basis. The 2nd or 3rd time I backed up, it said the storage was full, and I knew there was no way it was full. I emailed tech support for SimpleTech, and the guy recommended doing a full backup instead of an incremental one to start over. That was a bit of trouble, as I needed to move files around to keep from losing some, but I did it,(and lost some anyway that I'd forgotten about) and it was fine for a couple of times after that, but once again, it said it was full. Support said do a reformat. Well, that's just more trouble than I was prepared for, so I'm buying a new backup, and I'm pretty sure it won't be SimpleTech."
3,"Not what you'd expect from CB, the kings of electronica","Okay dj'ing, but a no-no if you're looking for stuff similar to Exit Planet Dust... More funky / jungle-like than their other recs. Not bad, but not really what you're looking for if you want Prodigy / Crystal Method-kinda music..."
2,Not really worth messing with,"I've heard that the Chemical Brothers are excellent DJ's, capable of getting a party moving like few others. If so, they fooled me. Basically, this mix has several highlights (""Brothers Gonna Work It Out"", ""Hot Wheels - The Chase"", ""Don't Stop The Rock"", ""Mars Needs Women"") strung together by long stretches of... monotony. I love techno, but most of this seems so flat and uninspired. Also, the mixing is pretty shaky, almost falling apart in several places. The Chemical Brothers are great, so I hate to pan this mix, but they're much better producers than DJ's."
4,has its place...,"this chemical brothers release may disappoint some puritans, but it is hot. is that some wink i hear??"
4,It's pretty damn good!,This cd is good cept i wish they would of cut the tracks to the right numbers... kind of a pain to fast forward to certain parts. oh well...
2,scratchy-ass boring disco loops,"The first cut (Brother's gonna work it out) is OK, but between the scratcy-ass boring disco loops and the way-overused 303, 'dig your own hole' was much more interesting. Hey, when is amazon gonna carry the 'high steppers'?"
2,I'm dissapointed,This CD gets boring after the second listen. It's repetative and very disappointing. Some of the songs they use are great but the mixing is second rate. The bros should stick to making their own music insted of doing DJ mix albums. Buy this one used if you are a C-Bros fan.
1,"Excuse me, this sucks","ok, the Bro heads are gonna want to kill me for this but... What were they thinking? Sure, very obscure wax was spun here and there are some very deft skills at work. Overall this album is choppy and horribly disjointed. I've heard mix tapes from unknowns that are MUCH better than any thing here. Please consider carefully before you buy. Listen to those samples listed above and know thats as good as it gets."
2,too much mess,"this album is too much full of every type of sound, if you are looking for the music that really rappresent the Chemical the album you have to buy is Exit Planet Dust"
5,Non-stop Beats,"Simply stated, this is 70 minutes of non-stop music from some fo the coolest artists around, all mixed with style by the Brothers Chemical. Never gets dull, never fails to please"
3,BIG SO-SO,"The only great tracks where all the ones by the chemicals, everything else really wasn't a big deal, pretty dull."
5,"An exciting series of intrigue and suspense, Man in a Suitcase is not to be missed","Man in a Suitcase, set 1 is a DVD collection chronicling the harrowing adventures of ""Mac"" McGill (played by Richard Bradford), an ex-spy wrongfully terminated by U.S intelligence. He embarks on a freelance career as a private detective based in London, yet no matter how far he travels in his new job, he inevitably seems to conflict with British authorities, the Soviets, and former colleagues in American espionage. Though he strives to clear his name, he's forced to remain on the run, accepting jobs from shady contacts of European society. An exciting series of intrigue and suspense, Man in a Suitcase is not to be missed. 15 episodes on 4 discs, 779 min., full screen."
1,"BEWARE, Poor quality knock off","I received this today from Toyolink Inc, and am not happy with the product quality. The bear is poorly sewn, the material is thin and sub par when compared to actual Rilakkuma merchandise. One of the his paws is sewn properly and the other is some undistinguished shape with the seams in totally different places from the normal looking paw. The eyes are not even, and the eye material is thin and cheap. The ""plush"" toy is actually not so plush, having hard silicone beads in the paws and back. This is an obvious knock off being sold as the real thing."
5,THE BEST VAMPIRE CHRONICLES EVER WRITTEN!!!!!,This is one of the greatest stories ever written! Anne Rice is superb! This is a page turner! I can hardly wait until the next chronicle is born! Lestat and Louie are alive and living in Anne Rice! These are destined to become classics!
5,"Lestat, you give new meaning to the slang ""bite me!""","If Interview drove you to fantasize about becoming a vampire, this book will cause you to start a full-scale search for a vampire to ""bring you over."" LOVED IT. Lestat, I'm waiting for you. Anytime."
5,"Wonderful, rich male-bonding, stunningly vivid words, a must",I think one of Anne Rice's best novels. The Vampire Chronicles were hard to put down because of the richness of the imagery she creates. Male intimate bonding characters much deeper than any movie with Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise. Read and enjoy
3,I love it......but......,"I read the stories before I saw the film. Then read the stories again.And even tho I understand why they have to abridge these tales (have you seen the size of the original books!!) it still saddens me that some of the intricacy is lost. That said, stunning, beautiful, fabulous art, and a great way to get into the stories. Try The Mayfair Witches next. Just the best."
3,"Not as good as IWTV, but not that bad","The Vampire Lestat was an overview of Lestat's mortal life, and his birth into darkness, and his current life. It starts off in the present time, then, upon reading IWTV, Lestat takes you back to his mortal childhood and tells his story, then brings you back to the present and tells you his plans for the future. The history is a bit long, but once you're past it, a rather good book."
4,Can we know the true Lestat?,"Can we know the true Lestat from just one reading of this excellent work by Anne Rice? I doubt it and therefore eagerly await (awaited) future installments in the saga. Taken in his youth and brought against his will to an eternally dark afterlife, Lestat spends the centuries searching for a definition of his existence. Along the way he meets others like himself that all have a story as interesting as his own. For lovers of light horror, for lovers of historical romance, for those with a stomach for the questionable sexuality of male vampires in general, this is a book not to be missed."
5,Wireless Sounds Great,"These speakers are what I was searching for. They are small, sounds great and easy to setup. I used these while entertaining during the Holiday season. The transmitter is located in my small computer room at the front of the house, and the speakers are in a sunroom addition at the rear of the house. The computer room was loaded with kids playing X-BOX Guitar Hero and they did not interrupt the signal to the speakers. When I first set this up I was getting sporadic signal interruption until I switched channel settings for the best reception and I now get excellent sound. Anyone looking for 'stereo' wireless speakers that sound fantastic should look carefully at these."
4,No Strings Attached,"Terrific sound!I bought these as a gift for Christmas. The recipient is EXTREMELY happy with them and she is very hard to buy for! Installation is easy. If you are using them with a Bose Wave System, plug the wireless station into the headphone jack.For the best reception, put them either high on the wall or on top of a bookcase if you can."
2,Died after a little more than a year,"These speakers worked great until they suddenly stopped transmitting sound a few months ago. We finally got around to troubleshooting, trying them on different tvs and no dice. Dissapointing service life for electronics costing almost $200. We're past amazon's return window so we're stuck I guess."
2,"Nice sound, terrible wireless reception","I have my sound system in the living room and just wanted to add some speakers in my bedroom.I live in a medium size apartment, the distance between the emiter and the receiver is less than 10 mts (30 feet). Only one wall exists between them and I places the emiter close to the ceiling and the antena pointing to the bedroom.All seemed to be fine but....1. When I walk in the bedroom the signal gets lost, I'm short and the emiter and receiver are installed close to the celiling but my walking interrupts the signal anyway.2. Sometimes, even if I'm lying in the bed and move a little. The signal also gets lost.3. As someone already pointed, it shutdowns the wireless network from time to time. (More often than ""from time to time"" really)I love the sound of the speakers, but the wireless system is really bad. It's not even acceptable, it doesn't works as should for a system which innovation is precisely to be wireless.Not happy at all with the speakers."
1,Barely wireless,"These speakers are only wireless in the lack of a wire from the transmitter to the speakers. The photos are misleading. It appears that the right speaker is completely wireless, as in no wires connected to it. Actually, neither speaker functions wirelessly. The transmitter speaker must both be wired to an outlet, and if you want to listen to both speakers, to the other speaker. In fact, there is no component in the system that has no wires. Except the remote control, I guess. Most of the other reviews seem to have expected this. Maybe I'm just acting too much from a product that is marketed as wireless - that is for one of the components to actually BE wireless."
4,compatability,"This product has one big problem,compatability it dose not work with older recivers ,their are many.if signal from reciver is amphlified to the transmiter, it will not work.In other words if your out put from the reciver will power a speaker it over loads the transmiter and it will not work. It works on a low out put like a ipond."
1,JBL CONTROL 2.4G WIRELESS SPEAJERS,"THIS IS NOT A TRUE WIRELESS SPEAKERS, YOU HAVE TO RUN ABOUT 30FT OF SPEAKER WIRE FROM ONE SPEAKER TO THE OTHER"
5,SHORT ON TECHNICAL INFO,"I KNOW THAT JBL EQUIPMENT IS GOOD,BUT: IF THE AD HAD STATED THAT THE WIRELESS SYSTEM REQUIRES PREAMP RCA OUTPUTS ON THE AV RECEIVER, I WOULD HAVE NOT PURCHASED THIS ITEM. I WILL HAVE TO RETURN THE WIRELESS SYSTEM. CAN NOT USE I'VE WASTED MY TIME AND YOURS I MUST GET A RETURN AUTHORIZATION # GENE MAYHER 330 467 8680"
1,did not work with my system,"We have a new, fairly standard stereo system that is less than 6 mo old and these speakers were not compatible - it was going to require purchase of a $50 cable adapter to make them work. Before you buy them make sure your system is compatible."
1,defective product,When this product arrived it was aparent that it was opened and most likely sent back defective before being repackaged and sent to me. Iset it up only to find that the speakers did not power up. then I had to repackage it and send it back.
1,Just Awful,"For some reason, my idiot boyfriend bought these for 228, which is way too much. The instructions say the speakers need to be 35 feet from the router. So, unless you are using them in a business location, they echo. No, I don't mean they give you a clear surround sound effect, I mean they have about a full second delay from the TV to the speakers. They are not completely ""wireless"" either. The speakers are wired to each other, so you still have an awkward wire across the room...plus the obvious cord to the outlet."
3,"Great Sound, Lousy Operation","Once I got the speakers working they sounded great. However, setup, and on-going usage is a real nuisance.First, it took a long time to figure out that there has to be a direct line of sight path between the transmitter and the active speaker.Then there are the operational issues:1. The transmitter, my Pioneer receiver, and active speaker seem to have to be turned on in a specific order. I can't remember what that is, but I now leave on the transmitter and speaker all the time.2. Once music has stopped play you must mute the active speaker or it loses contact with the transmitter.3. Once the music has stopped, you must turn off the receiver or the transmitter loses touch with the speaker.4. The remote for the active speaker is also a very narrow direct line of sight, and its range is not very good.While I have finally figured out how to make the setup work, and how to keep it working, I would not buy these wireless speakers another time."
1,Not what was expected,"This is only a wireless speaker for one of the speakers. You have to wire the other one to the first. This defeats the wireless concept. Returned these and bought ones that are truely ""wireless""."
4,JBL Does it again!,"I have these on top of my kitchen cabinets since I entertain a lot, and they are fantastic. I dont want them too loud so people can talk, but the sound is great, especially for the money."
3,Range from transmitter very dissapointing,"The speakers deliver a full-ranged, powerfur sound, but the range from the transmitter is more around 15-20feet instead of the 70feet claimed by supplier."
5,Easy as advertised.,Very easy set up and worked well the first try. Only glitch was that the battery in the remote was dead on arrival and had to run to the store to get a button battery. I use it every day attached to my Bose radio so when the alarm goes off I have news and music in the bathroom while showering. The only time I notice static is if a person puts their body close to the transmitter directly between it and the receiving speaker. I am very happy how they work and more than enough power.
2,Not wireless,"Ordered wireless speakers which comes with wires. I thought they would be like our old ones. You just have a transmitter attached to the TV the speakers then plug in where ever you want them to be. These speakers have to be wired together so they have to be near each other or you have to run tons of wire. Plus the remote control doesn't operate them. You have to have them set to your TV. I prefer to have control of the speakers separate from the TV speakers.Not happy with these, but my husband is still working on them to see if they will be what we want to keep"
1,TOTALLY STOPPED W0RKING AFTER 4 MONTHS,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Here's why: The remote did not work properly when the product arrived. I decided to work around that. Speakers totally stopped working after 4 months. That was the good news. The bad news was trying to deal with JBL. I spent 2 hours on the phone, being cut off several times. Finally I got to speak with tech support who told me that the system needs to be replaced. He told me to fax certain info to him and they would send to me a return number. I faxed the info but instead of a return number I received an email asking for more information. I responded but they never did. So I contacted Amazon. AMAZON WAS GREAT. They sent to me a return label for free shipping and a refund, minus only a restocking fee. I WILL NEVER DEAL WITH JBL AGAIN."
3,Interesting but not really informative,Anton Gil's style of writing is rather purple and full of dripping fanboyism. I was somewhat put off by his casual dismissal of women and changing attitudes towards their clothing and appearance in his rush to gush on Il Magnifico. His constant denigration of the Middle Ages and comparison of the Renaissance to the rising sun became tedious and annoying.It takes Gil 75 pages to even get to the birth of Michelangelo: a good third of the book spent extolling the virtues of the Medicis. Sadly I think he fell into the pit of wanting to write about someone about whom there is not much extant information on. Consequently the book drifts into long tangents on other people and Cliffs Notes views of the politics of the time.It's a good read and a page turner but is it history? I don't think so...
2,Nice cover poor contents,This book tells us about almost everything but little about the David.The author has selected info from various books and tells well known stories.Very disappointing
5,Brilliant from portugal,"from Portugal, my city and my neighborhood, there was this band. not for this reason that I voted with five stars, but because this work of music blown up my heart and soul and entered, from the very beginning, to my discography preferred to listen to. the combination of the strong and clear male voice with the bright and sweet female voice carried so well on those inspired, brilliant and breaths chord progressions, supported by the artistic simplicity of the rhythmic section and bass composition, makes this album a work of world-class art.must listen to.impossible to suggest a particular song as all those are those creative and unique ones."
5,Trendy Mat - Very Usefull,I have used this mat almost everytime I've been outdoors. I haven't seen anything like it at any department store and its much cheaper than the mats at the beachside boutiques. It is an awesome value for the price.
5,Fantastic,"was using theGUS but had to go to the slip on with velcro. Gil is excetional. And, the price was excellent"
5,At Last Comfortable shoes,"I have a swelling problem and find it hard to find shoes with enough ""clearance"" in the top to fit properly. These shoes are wonderful. I slipped in an insole under the shoes own insole on one foot to make it fit properly and the other with the swelling problem fits perfect. I am buying another pair of these in brown. They were comfortable right from the beginning and feel like walking around in slippers,but offer me the support that I need.My podiatrist recommended these shoes to me and I'm so glad that he did.You can't go wrong with these shoes."
1,mens hush puppies(sport white),"I have been out state and just returned home and was happy my order was here.(that is untill I opened the box)The white hush puppies that I ordered are a sick grey but labeled as white.When you order a product you expect to receive what is shown,not some off colored product which was sent.Also the return policy is bad.I will not purchase from the co. that sent my shoes."
4,Dad's Slip On Hush Puppies,"I bought these shoes for my Dad. He is 88 years old, and he loves these shoes. They are very smart looking, easy to take on and off, and very comfortable. He had been wearing some less expensive Dr. Scholl's slip on shoes, but these are much more attractive and better made. The Dr. Scholl's came apart after six months, so even though they are cheaper at first, they just don't last. The Hush Puppies keep a nice buffed look without polishing. Just a wipe with a damp cloth and they look just like new. I ordered his regular size and it was just right."
1,Hush Puppy shoes purchased thru Amazon,"Liked the shoe style, but the shoes were uncomfortable. Felt like they were off-center, causing me to walk on the arch more, which was very uncomfortable. I returned the shoes and Amazon did a fantastic job in acknowledging the return and very quickly processing the refund. I will shop with Amazon again!"
2,Very light but no support!,"I bought these as uniform school shoes for my son. He found them light, however, they fit more like loafers and are very loose and sometimes feel like they will fall off his feet. They have no to little support for the arches and ankles. His foot slips in and out of them. They are his right size, however, they simply don't fit very well as a daily secure school shoe. We also bought the New Balance Men's Walking Shoe in black and he loves those and they fit more securely and snugly and comfortably."
5,PERFECT SHOE FOR SENIOR,"I too ordered these for my Dad after reading all the great reviews. They are well made, comfortable and the velcro closure is perfect. Hush Puppies brand is traditional quality. These are great gift for a senior dad if you want to make his feet comfortable."
5,Just right for easy on-and-off,"I am a caregiver for my husband, who manages to wear out shoes quite regularly in spite of limited walking ability. He had already owned these nice-appearing leather shoes in black, but they needed replacing. Since I must keep an eye on price as well as quality, I compared prices and ended up here. I am pleased to report that the sizes run true, and once you own a pair of these shoes, chances are you will be able to order the same size and slip right into them! The velcro flaps hold up very well with the life of the shoe, and their ease of use aids autonomy. While the shoes are relatively light weight, the soles are a marvel, with deep treads and broad bases. This enables a person to keep a good sense of balance and not worry about slipping. Good luck and happy walking or running or skipping as best you can!"
2,Hush Puppies Gil,The shoes where very comfortable but the Shoes fit a half sizeto big and where very loose and sloppy.
4,hushpuppy shoes,I was looking for a pair of real comfortable shoes. These shoes have a very high arch. Other than that slight problem I would have given a 5 star
1,Stretch dvd,"Well,I was disappointed with this dvd, it is sooooooooo boring, I guess that's what yoga is supposed to be. It did not meet my expectations at all, I feel that honestly I paid way to much for it, sorry I could not send it back. Maybe it is worth about $5.00. If you like boring this would be the one to get, but don't pay this price for it, wait to find it at a yard sale. (sorry)"
1,Didn't work at all for me.,"I ordered the product as part of an effort (working with my doctor) to get my Cholesterol numbers down where they should be using only diet and supplements. I took Sytrinol for 6 months, as part of a program which included regular exercise and moderately stringent dietary controls. At the end of the 6 months, my lab results showed no improvement.I can't say that Sytrinol won't work for anyone; just that it did not work for me, at all."
5,Amazing books for teaching kids about art,"This book - along with every other one in the ""Getting to Know the World's Famous Artists"" series -- is a fantastic purchase all around. It puts a creative spin on the teaching of art to children and makes the artists' stories come to life in a ""current"" and cool way -- using graphics/cartoons, great photos of masterpieces and easy-to-understand language. My son is 8 years old and loves all of the books -- I think they are appropriate for a range of ages (4 or 5 yrs to 10 / 11 / 12 yrs.)"
3,Has Information but hard to digest.,If you are not a student of theology then this is not the best choice. It has a lot of good history but it is rather dry and difficult to read. I was disappointed.I was looking for a book like you could be teaching junior high kids from simple basic facts. Don't get me wrong this is written very well and answers many questions you just have to think hard to understand what is being said.
2,good intentions but poorly written,The book attempts to discuss the rasons for being a Lutheran . The author rambles from one topic and heading to another . Sentence structure is poorly formed and often repetative .
1,Disappointed,"I am returning this book as I belong to the Evangelican Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and this author is Missouri Synod. This was not included in the info about the book. There are major theological differences between Missouri Synod Lutherans and ELCA Lutherans. Won't go into it all here but the ELCA is in full Communion with The Episcopal CHurch , the Presbyterian Church (US) and has an early stage agreement with the United Methodist Church - but we have no such agreement with the Missouri Synod!"
4,Almost a Lutheran?,Great book and not just for Lutherans but all those who are interested in the Lutheran Church. Preus does an excellent job through point by point explanations of the Lutheran positions on a variety of topics. Highly recommended.
2,Boring but not terrible,Boring movie. Plain and simple. Too slow - everything was as expected with no interesting side plots to carry my attention. Not worth watching.
1,total crap,"Trimbrite T1754 Limo Tint 20""""X10'Lt.Smoke ""this is the worst tint i have ever worked with buy it if you want to just throw it in the trash because thats what i did you cant get the stuff apart with out it rolling back on its self"
2,No adhesive,It does not come with adhesive on anyside of the film. The instructions on and in the box say that you peel off the backing to expose the adhesive.....But there is no backing. I ended up buyin some spray adhesive and doing it the old fashion way. Not what I wanted at all. But oh well it is cheap.
2,Small town mystery,This was pretty much a turned out formula book. Romance was trite as well. That is it for me and this author.
2,"An OK read, but only that.","When adding the Kindle edition from the print I can't understand why the author didn't bring it up to date, cell phone wise. It was like stepping back into the dark age of last century. So many things depended upon people finding a phone to use...and answering machines?? Do they still exist? There's also the matter of too many typos. She needs a copy editor.A bit boring, a bit dull, no real action. The only reason I finished it was because I'm stuck in bed with the flu."
2,Can you spell?,"The poor spelling in this book really got in the way of my enjoying it. One particular annoying part was a character whose name changed spelling nearly each time it was in the book..Madelaine or Madeleine???There was at least 10 times that it was different, and they were close together maybe only 2 or 3 lines apart. Other items were mostly careless..........someone named Alice was called Alive etc. This can be attributed to using only spell check, rather than an actual person reading/proofing it. The story was only so-so!Will not read her again!"
3,dYING FOR A CHANGE BY kATHLEEN DELANEY,I am not impressed with this mystery. It seems that too many characters are introduced to make this a pleasant read
3,Dying for a Change review,"The book wasn't very exciting compared to other books I have read. However, it was well written and I liked it well enough to finish reading it."
3,In desparate need of editing.,Good story and kept my interest even after climbing over all the errors that would have been caught if properly edited.
5,Just for Fun!,"Kathleen Delaney nails the concept of a fun, easy read! What a great book to take on a plane, read in the tub, or just enjoy from the back porch on a lazy afternoon. I loved Dying for a Change. The book quickly drew me in and I couldn't put it down until the mystery had been solved. The characters were quirky, likeable, and refreshingly real people. This is a must read for anyone who has lived through the transformation of small town America ... or for anyone that just wants to escape away for a couple hours of sheer entertainment! Great first book for the author. I loved the subtle humor and definitely look forward to more."
3,"Works well, with limitations",Installed this on a Jeep Grand Cherokee factory rack. Not enough clearance between the roof and ski bindings - had to take apart skis and lay them flat. Therefore could barely fit 2 skis + 1 snowboard. Look for a height adjustable or bigger rack such as the Yakima Fat Cat if you're carrying more than 3 pair of skis.
4,"Easy to install, good value. Fits to Nissan Murano 2005 with crossbars",Product met my expectations. Easy to install to Nissan Murana 2005 with crossbars. Product was cheaper at Amazon than at [...].
4,Very well built and installation wasn't too difficult,holds 4 sets of skis perfectly and very secure. The springs to hold the bar up when you are loading your skis in could be stronger. It just barely keeps the locking bar up and out of the way.
4,Remove the knobs!,I like everything about this product except for the knobs. They make it a bit difficult to screw out if the cable is screwed in tight. Maybe I just have large fingers but they seem hard to grasp sometimes.
5,Hopefully useful review even though I haven't read the book!,"This book received such a glowing in-depth review (from reviewer ""Center for Nonprofit Management""), I was disappointed to see that it was out-of-print.Then I saw the good news - there's a second edition of this book (which strangely was published only 7 days before the in-depth review was written)!So fret not, you activist, grant-writing wannabes (or is that grant-writing, activist wannabes?), just head on over to ISBN 0787965782 and begin your journey of making a difference!"
3,Not what I was looking for....,"Don't get me wrong, it's a nice watch that seems like it will be very durable, but the online picture is deceiving. I thought this could be a women's watch, if not maybe even a unisex watch? And I can't say that the description helped too much. I was shocked when I got it to see that the face of the watch is HUGE! Definitely a MEN'S watch. Also, the band is rubber and is kind of....chalky? I washed it but looked at it recently to see that once it dries it's still has this kind of chalky film on it. I'm assuming with wear, the band will stop looking like that? Anyway, it's nice, just not for me, so it went to the gift closet. A Christmas gift for some lucky gent..."
1,Get real!,"I'm a Buddhist. I took my refuge vows from a tulku. I've meditated for decades. I am sorry to write this review, but feel I must.I rate this book one star because I can't rate it lower and submit the review. I've read Lobsang Rampa's books and heard his tapes. He has no standing among Tibetan religious schools. He's a Brit that's been around for years duping people who are not informed about Tibetan Buddhism.If you want to learn about true spirituality and authentic Tibetan Buddhism, get a book by the Dalai Lama. Amazon.com has lots of them. You will feel the difference!"
3,I want to give this product five stars - Now I can give it 5 Stars,"This product worked better then expected. The pictures in day and night was crystal clear and the range was far better then on some of the reviews I read.So why only two stars? Because three days later, this camera stopped working. I had already trashed the packaging (my fault) and ran the camera for 24 straight hours. Other then that, I'd most definitly recommend this camera.UPDATEI notified AMAZON that the product went bad and that it could've been my fault for leaving it on for 24 straight hours. AMAZON sent a replacement via overnight express. Very impressive. So now I give the product 5 stars and give AMAZON 6 Stars."
3,Poor range,The camera is very rigid and can sustain outdoor operation. the Night vision is very good but the range is very poor.
2,worst wireless camera system ever.,"it interferes with my wireless linksys system,it wipes it out despite changing network frequencies,I gave it away to a relative who does not have the same the same situation hopefully he will not have the same problem."
1,Very peeved,"I ordered 3 of these cameras (to complete a set of 4 for a very special trip). Got them a couple days before the trip only to find EVERY SINGLE ONE was defective! They were ALL missing the little switch for changing the channels so you can use more than one at once, which was the whole point of buying them!I didn't have time to order them from elsewhere in time for the trip. I had to return them all the manufacturer for replacements. Very peeved!!"
3,swann wireless cameras,"The product is good for just mounting on a flat area to capture an area up to about 30-40 feet. changes alot from black and white to color. not good for mounting at any angle. also check the machine you will be using it with yourself, customer service personal are not educated enough to give very good advice on weather or not these items are compatible with each other or not."
2,Damaged goods,"I ordered two reams of paper for publication purposes. Unfortunately, the corners of the paper were so bent at least 10% of the paper was unusable. I did receive a prompt reply from customer service when I brought this to their attention and they very quickly sent me a new ream, which I appreciated. Unfortunately, 90% of that ream was unusable. I have no experience with their other products, but I would not order paper from this company again."
3,"Good for color, not so hot for duplex prints","I bought this paper for my HP Color LaserJet 2605dn. It has sufficient opacity to make good color prints, and good weight without being a bristol.Unfortunately, on my printer at least when I print two-sided, the coating on the paper doesn't seem to handle the heat from the second passage through the printer and develops an unattractive mottled aspect. It works just fine in my monochrome HP Laserjet 1320, however, I suspect it has a better paper feed."
5,Very Good Quality,I am very pleased with the quality of this paper.I've been going through reams of copy paper that I recently purchased at a great discounted price; the initial cost was a pleasant feature but the final copies were a disappointment.The HP Laserjet Premium Choice Paper just seems to flow through the machine and consistently produces high-quality images.This product deserves a five-star rating.
3,Final Pairing of Groove and 'Spoon,"~ Despite the confusing listing for this CD as being performed by J/Holmes Witherspoon, this CD is actually ""As Blue As They Can Be"" by Richard 'Groove' Holmes and Jimmy Witherspoon, which has also been released as ""As Blue As They Want To Be"". Follow those links for details about the recording and reviews."
1,The Kindle edition only.,"The Kindle edition has no way to quickly get to each chapter. In the table of contents it only has a link for ""Text and Commentary on Romans,"" once you click on that it takes you to Romans 1:1-7. If you wanted to study those verses great, but if you wanted to study Romans 13:8-10, well then you have to go and find it yourself. With hundreds of pages that is extremely frustrating. I had Amazon return my money right after I discovered this."
2,I should have listened,"I had the same problem another person had. My glasses don't fit. So now I have two racks that I can't put anything in. I have multiple kinds of stemware, all relatively cheap, and none of them fit."
3,Opening is too small,"I really wanted this wine rack to work for me. I measured the area under the kitchen cabinet and made sure the wine rack would fit the space. Had to modify the cabinet itself but I was proud of my ingenuity. (Added wooden blocks to level the rack under the cabinet. Super simple.) Leveled, installed, PERFECT! Then I went to ""proudly"" hang my wine glasses and....wait for it....the base of my wine glasses wont fit in the opening?!?!? Whaaaaat? Standard wine glasses, not huge goblets or fancy unique crystal. Just regular old wine glasses. I'm bummed. The rack is very sturdy, well built. It will last forever. The screws that came with it for the install didn't seem adequate for the install so you may need a few of your own. (bigger disc head or perhaps washers) So overall a great wine glass rack unless you want to hang wine glasses in it."
3,NO FANCY Glasses Allowed!,"Well, the actual item is not bad. But the description should state that it only accepts average wine glasses. My pottery barn wine glass stem bases are to wide, therefore I can not even use this item. It lives in my closet in a box."
1,Too small,Any ordinary wine glass will not fit. I had to bend rack just to fit my stemware. do not purchase this item.
2,Do they make wine shot glasses??,I have no idea what fits into these tiny wine racks....nothing standard. Check your measurements before you order these. I had to cut the racks to get any of my wine and champaign glasses to fit. At least they are sturdy!
5,Just what our wine glasses ordered,"We were looking for a wine glass rack for some time, and then this one popped up on Amazon, and we got it. It adds class to our bar, well worth the money and sturdy. Thanks Amazon"
4,Really great looking,Would have given it five stars but the opening is just a tad too small for my wine glasses. Have to juggle a bit to put them in but looks great and makes things very convenient.
2,Not Enough Flavor and Super Small!,These lost their flavor pretty quickly and didn't seem to have much flavor to begin with actually. The toothpics are very small - I am going to look for a more substantial (longer) flavored toothpick with a little more punch. If you like 'em short and mild then these are for you!
5,Beautiful Dress Shoes,These are great shoes. The leather looks really good and expensive.Don't know how they fit yet as they are a Christmas gift and have notbeen tried on....Sure they will be just fine.
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Sara Pezzini's life as a New York detective, and wearer of the very strange Witchblade just gets weirder, as she stumbless across Jackie Estacado. He is a gangster, but like her, he has some very strange things riding around with him, in the form of the Darkness. In this crossover Sara and Jackie are sometimes at cross purposes, sometimes working together, and breaking lots of things."
4,Beautiful,"This item greatly adds to my ""village"" display. The only problem is that the people are not in proportion with the rest os the ""village"" people."
2,Chopstick Review,"Not a very big investement, around ten bucks for two sets. Looked cool online but both sets are warped and bent. Tried to use them to eat but the free ones from the chinese restaurant work better because they are straight. I would return them but its not worth ten bucks to stand in line at the post office to pay three bucks to ship them back. Oh well, I should have ordered the stainless steel ones first."
5,Great Chopsticks,These chopsticks exceeded my expectations. They are very easy to use and it almost feels like it has a magnet because food is so easliy grabed. They are easy to manipulate and the price was very fair.
3,decent chopsticks,"they are fancy looking and they come with the nice holders, but you never actually use them at the table you just use the holders to keep the chopsticks fro touching the counter while you are cooking. THey are bamboo but kind of smooth so food sometimes slips off a little more than the regular disposable wooden chopsticks.Mostly I bought them because I needed something to put me over the $25 limit for shipping."
4,Not too bad surprisingly,"Like someone said in an earlier review, don't buy this for the bamboo holder. I didn't hesitate a second to throw them in the trash after I opened the packaging. Although the sticks themselves are pretty decent. They are extremely light in weight. They kind of ""square off"" towards the top so they aren't completely round. The finish on them is slightly slippery when handling food but it seems like a pretty thin finish that will wear off a bit over time. Sadly i did pay the $10 for the set, but oh well. I think they'd be better priced around $5-$6 in my opinion."
4,Nice chopsticks at a great price,I ordered eight pairs of these so I'd have a matching set for dinner parties. They're very elegant considering their affordable price. The holder are mostly aesthetic since the chopsticks do not fit tightly inside them. They do keep the two sticks together nicely on the edge of the plate though. I am very pleased with my purchase overall.
5,Beautiful quality!,The quality of these chopsticks is wonderful! They were a Christmas gift for my son and he loved them very much!
4,I love chopsticks,"I love the chopsticks, though they do not fit snuggly into the bamboo holders like I thought they would, but I was able to fit all four chopsticks nicely into to one holder."
2,not exceptional,"I don't even use it anymore, didn't think it was that great. I got a gel rest from fellows, a lot better...."
2,not much filling,i agree with the other reviews. the have a bad smell that hasnt went away and it has been about two weeks now. there isnt much filling to give very much support and the material is very itchy and annoying. i reccomend teh fellowes mouse and wrist pads. they have much more of teh gel filling and teh surface is smooth and cool. not itchy. and they dont have a smell! not even when you first open it. they seem like much better quality for ur money.
1,Piece of junk,"My company bought me one of these earlier in the year and upon receiving it I got an instant headache from the overhwelming chemical smell. I had to put it in the utility room for a month let it outgas. Within a couple of months after using it, it started falling apart with rips and tears everywhere. Finally threw it out.I asked the company to buy me a new one but from a different manufacturer. Well, they didn't. I got the same brand. Again, had to let it outgas for several weeks. Then, it ruptured within a week of starting to use it! ooey gooey chemical stuff started flowing out.The first one I got did not allow the goo to escape when it broke, but this must be a new design. Lucky me. Going in the garbage right now."
2,Didn't last a year,"I work as a graphic designer and web developer and I am at my computer most of the day. This particular wrist rest was working just fine until it inexplicably ruptured and the greasy, snotty goo started coming out of the crimped edge near my left hand. Now it's going in the garbage. Shame, too, it was comfy while it lasted."
4,ok for what it is,"This book isn't really history or biography for that matter. Its an in-between kind of book that wants to imagine a past into existance based on speculation rather than evidence or fact. The factual details of the life of Leo Africanus would make a chapter. And even the facts we do have about his life are colored by a particular point of view which has to be questioned.Natalie Davis does her best based on all sorts of other material to imagine a public and private life for the man. As speculative fiction, it works. The only problem being that ignorant readers will begin to take this book as if were fact rather than a created story. The fault I find is that the book doesn't draw enough distinction about what is being imagined versus the actual facts of his life.The book is very good, but its not history or biography and should not be read as history or biography."
2,"Fascinating Man, Boring Book","To read a really excellent book about Leo The African, I recommend the far superior ""Leo Africanus"" by Amin Maalouf, a winner of several literary awards and an amazing book."
4,What does this tell us,"Obviously there is sopposed to be a message here. Leo Africanus, geographer, Muslim, married to a Jewish convert, himself a Muslim convert, victim of priacy, vegabond, scholar, man of mystery, a polymath able to move between the cultures of Europe and North Africa during the time of the reformation and the rennaisance. What can one make of this. Is this sopposed to teach us tolerance? What is does teach us is that there apparently was more connection between cultures in the 16th century then we are allowed to know about today. Today we are todlt hat 'evil' barborous 'crusading' Europe was busy colonizng and enslaving the world, which consisted of either African slaves or Muslim victims. Perhaps this book sheds light on how scholarship has twisted European history so much, so that it no longer resmbles what it was in the least bit. Here, throught the life story of one man, we see the actual interplay of culture, diversity and religion in the 16th century.Seth J. Frantzman"
3,A Mixed Bag,"Pros:- This lens is very well built. It feels solid.- For the price, it goes to F3.5, which is as good or better than similarly priced lenses.- I wanted a dramatic fisheye effect and this lens certainly delivers.Cons:- When used with a camera like the EOS 20D, it does not support flashes like the 550EX. The flash simply becomes disabled.Overall:If you usually buy L series lenses, you will find the limitations of this lens as a disappointment. However, if you usually stick to the more budget priced lenses, then you will likely enjoy this lens. It is a fine fisheye for the price."
5,Worth every dime,"I am definitely an ameatur, however, I can tell quality in hardware and in photo images. I purchased this lens based off of the reviews and I just couldn't be happier with it. I am having so much fun using it, and after doing a lot of comparison with other lenses that are comparable, I am happy that I chose this one. It is built really well, is cheaper than others in it's class, and the zoom option makes it an extreme fisheye or just a wide angle. I love it. It's a no brainer. The only thing I could see as a downside is that the lens is hyper-sensitive to light. I actually like that feature because of the artistic things that can be done with lighting, but being a novice, I need to make adjustments to the lighting with this lens, that my others don't require. The lens cap is ugly, but works well. Overall, Well built with beautiful results."
4,the best for the price,It is the best fisheye for the price the quality is 100% color and every thingI had fun using it fast focus I recommend it for every one ((ammeter or pro))Although I had one problem with it. It is too hard to fit it to the camera I bought 2 lensesFor 2 cameras {canon 400d and canon 40d} and I faced the same problem on both camerasYou will have to use force to fit them. Also I faced the same problem on the lens cap it too hard to remove and put onOther then that the lens is 100% perfect I uploaded some pics I took with the lens and you can visit my web pageFor more pics on www.flickr.com/photos/tj_wotaid
1,a month old and AFis not working,it has not even been a month and the Automatic Focus is not working!maybe its just mine
5,Shaking hands with Simic himself,"In a time when many critics despise the prose poem, brushing it aside, refusing to accept such work into the usual canon of lyric poetry, Charles Simic defies all boundaries, combining prose form with a lyrical quality often absent in accepted ""lyric"" verse.Simic's world of fantasy and surrealism don't come off as dreamy as one might think. If anything, he is somewhat of a journalist, reporting on events, images, people, animals, gypsies, etc., but from a purely personal perspective, a perspective we all can identify with because we see the world in similar fashion.There are few poets more intimate than Simic. When looking through his eyes, which have seen and survived much, one can't get closer to one of contemporary poetry's strongest voices."
4,crusaders of the machine,"I enjoyed this book. It was very well done, unique and extremely entertaining, still twenty dollars is too much to pay for a 130 page book."
3,mesh rips easy=unsafe for cats,"my cat bit through the mesh and within seconds was crawling out of his carrier. This was while underneath the airplane seat before takeoff, so you can imagine the panicked wrestling match that occurred until I was able to put the bag on my own lap and handle the situation easier. The carrier is amazing, but being made of mesh is useless for a cat who attempts to escape. This was the return flight home, meaning his first flight he made it through in tact. But all it took was one moment of ""I want out!"" and he accomplished that."
5,Great carrier,"We're moving and need a soft shell carrier for the plane. I've been practicing with our cat to get him used to it, and it's very comfortable (for me, a petite woman) walking around with him, and apparently for him."
1,DO NOT BUY FOR CATS!,"During the first part of a connecting international flight, the cat ripped through the mesh lining, several times and nearly escaped in the process. It made for a very interesting layover, as the two of us made a mad dash to get some re-enforcement for the lining. We ended up having to lay cardboard over every side and keep the top zipped slightly open for air. FOR CAT USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!"
1,Sherpa Bag Review,"If you are a distributor only of this product, what I am about to say is not your fault.The quality of this product is abysml. I had purchased four Sherpa bags in the past -excellent quality. Not this one. Leather replaced by vinyl, so flimsy it collapses, shoulderstrap already falling apart and leaking contents. I had to take one of my cats to the vet tohave fiber filling removed from her nose at a considerable expense. Never again! Sorry!!"
1,I'd give it a 0 if I could,"I'd give it 0 if I could..., August 28, 2006Reviewer: Carole (PA, USA) - See all my reviewsI must say, I was willing to pay this amount because I thought I was getting a better quality item. After a only a few weeks, this bag caved in and my puppy would no longer go into it. I tried several times and ways to fix it, but it would not stay up.I contacted the company and they told me to ""stuff it with wet towels and spray it heavily with starch..."" are they kidding? Then I found a reference to this problem under their web site FAQ's. So, they are knowingly selling a defective item and expecting the customer to then fix it. They never responded to my second email... I could not return it because it had been used.This is a company that does NOT stand behind it's products. I found a much less expensive one at target, and it works much better!Do not waste the extra $ on this item."
1,defective,the zippers are nylon..and the came apart with my cat inside. the bag is way past the 1 year warrenty but considering the cost. the 3-4 times it was ever used and then near disaster you need to be careful. i paid a lot of money to make sure my cat was SAFE when she had to leave the house. the zipper on the front is a total waste it will not rezip now.
5,"Good quality, travels well","I bought this Sherpa carrier specifically to fly my cat home with us for Christmas. My tall, long 12 lb cat fit in it with plenty of room to spare. It is a few inches higher than Southwest recommends for pet carriers, but it fit under the Southwest 737 plane seat just fine sideways. My cat loves it - we received it in November and immediately put it out and open on the floor so he could get used to it. At first, he spent more time sleeping in it than on his usual spot on the couch. It does feel like a good quality bag - the mesh seems to be reinforced with some sort of plastic coating and is stronger than I thought it would be. I never worried about him ripping it open, although he's a very easygoing cat. It's easy to clean as well."
1,Broke after first use,"I purchased the Sherpa Original Deluxe Pet Carrier, Medium, Black and just used it for the first time to transport my cat to the vet. During this first use, the mesh on the bag developed a rip, despite the fact that my cat was shockingly calm during transit and didn't attack the bag at all. My cat is 12 pounds - well within the weight range for this product and one trip is hardly excessive usage. This is supposed to be a quality product and I'm very disapointed that instead it's damaged after a single, non-intensive use. I'm concerned that it won't be secure to carry my pet during an international flight, which was the reason I purchased it. Although the top and side openings proved useful, I just can't trust a product that breaks immediately."
1,No longer available,"I wish that I could review this item, but I can't since it's no longer available from Petco, Amazon's partner. What Petco offers in its place is the Original Sherpa Bag. If I had wanted the Original Sherpa Bag, I would have ordered it."
2,Small print ... very small print,The book is absolutely wonderful! ... but the print in this compact version is far too small ... It just isn't usable. Recommend you stick with the standard size Bible and not the eye-test version <smile>.
5,Excellent Spiritual Growth,This is the best book for Spiritual Growth. I have shared this book with all of my friends and Sunday School class. Everyone loves it!
5,New Insight,"This Bible offers new insight to the Holy Scriptures. I have always found the Old Testament, in particular, difficult to keep up with in a historical context. This Bible offers a concise chain of events, while also giving helpful commentary and providing Scripture references for me to easily see parallels from book to book. It has given me a whole new understanding of God's word. I would recommend that anyone who wants to thoroughly study Scripture, pick up this Bible."
2,reissued 1996 -- come on folks!,"I'm really disappointed the way this was advertised as being an updated version of the old version. It wasn't. It had a new cover. It was a gift for my Mother. She loves it so it wasn't all bad, but come on folks. Get real. You can't sell the old ones, give them away. Don't repackage and call it updated."
4,The Daily Bible : In Chronological Order 365 Daily Readings,"It is good, but seems like it is missing something???Would prefer the explanation to be at the end and read the bible text first."
5,The Bible comes together,My husband and I have read through this chronological Bible about 10 times in the past 6 years and love the easy to understand flow. The running commentary helps keep us focused on what is going on which is especially good in the Old Testament. I bought this one for a gift for a new believer and will read along with her. By the way...we read it aloud to each other and take it in the car on trips. It helps the time go quickly and we especially like to read whole sections in one sitting; like everything to do with Solomon. It increases understanding and it's easy since it's all right together.
5,His Story from beginning to end...our life's manual,"This is a great Bible to read in one year. This is the first time I have read the Bible in a year and all the way through. I found that in reading THE Book this way, one could grasp God's message to us all, His plan's and why and how everyone fit's into HIS-STORY. I mean everyone who has lived, is living and will live. I ""got"" the whole picture of life in a wonderful, profound way reading this book. Mr Smith's insights were very thoughtful and helpful. Everyone should read this Bible. I am giving it as gifts for Christmas."
3,"Great Bible, small print","I love this Bible. I own the full size version(5 stars in my book) and just bought a compact edition for travel. The print on the compact edition is too small for me (hence the 3 stars). Though I am in my 30's, I am straining to read with this. The Daily Bible is arranged chronologically. I feel I have much more understading of the time line of events in the Bible and appreciate the text more. There are short introductions to new sections which just hightlight what events to look for and aren't overly filled with opinion or interpretation. If you want an NIV chronological Bible that gets you through the Bible in one year, get this one! Just try the full size editionThe Daily Bible: New International Version: With Devotional Insights to Guide You Through God's Word"
4,"Needs to be undated, just day to day.","Great concept, however, I would have better organization if it went: Day 1, Day 2, etc. for the readings, instead of by January 1....January 2....since I purchased this in APRIL! Can't go ahead and start in April, right, since it's IN ORDER! Oh well, I'm reading it anyway. :) It's still a fantastic read with nice devotional explainations."
2,The Daily Bible Compact edition,I was not expecting this to be so tiny I could not read it. I bought one for each of my Bible Study members because I love it so much but had no idea they would be 3x5 inches.
4,Very Convenient,"Every year, I make a resolution to read the bible everyday until the end of the year so when I found this bible, I thought it will make a difference. I had purchased the journal earlier but without the Daily Bible, the reading was cumbersome because I needed to open many different books and chapters before reading the texts for the day. The Daily Bible makes it way easier to read because all the texts are together.Needless to say, I have broken my resolution because I have missed so many days in January. Every day is a struggle."
3,Disappointed,"I thought I would be getting the actual Bible -- just put down in a book in chronological order. It isn't what I wanted or what I thought it would be.Things are in chronological order, but it's not like reading the Bible. There is storytelling by someone, and then there are excerpts from the books of the Bible. But you are not reading the whole Bible in chronological order."
4,Large Print Chronilogical Bible,"The Bible is GREAT. It arrived on time, however, the outer binding was not good. We have taped it and can use it that way. Overall, we were happy though. It was still a good value."
5,Great Value,"For the price, this is a good quality Bible. The cover is soft and nice, the pages are easy to read with minimal bleed through. It is written in paragraph form and makes a great daily reading Bible. You can't use this as your main Bible since it's in chronological order, and you can't just zip to a certain passage. BUT, it is a VERY good companion Bible to have. It has been a very enjoyable read, I'm going through it for a second time. I like reading chronologically, and the little helps are well-written and to the point, in gray boxes so as to differentiate from the Bible text. I am not big on having lots of ""extra"" boxes of man-written material in my bible, but they do a good job of providing a little extra explanation here and there to make for a nice reading. It also helps guide you as you may be jumping from one book to the next to smooth the transition. I highly recommend this Bible and think it's a very enjoyable way to read the Bible in a year, with the chronological twist."
4,Rabbi Ted,Easy to read and understand. Makes a good gift to friends who have never before read through the Bible. The commentary tes it all together
4,Good for travel,"I bought this bible to take on a cruise in November. Its small and light weight compared to the larger version I have. The print is pretty small and I have to use reading glasses to see it, but the small size was the overriding factor for me."
5,Awesome format,"Used this Bible for the first time in 2010 to create Bible study series on the flow of the Bible, the Gospels, and the book of Acts. Read it through for the first time in 2012- it really opens up the Bible in a new way to read it in chronological order! Good, brief notes. Of course there are parts I would have ordered differently, but tried to look beyond that to capture the ""story"" of the Bible. Highly recommend using this Bible for daily reading."
3,So-So,The type size is okay if you have good eyes. I can read it with my glasses. Prefer the regular sized type. The book itself is fabulously put together in chronological order (of the bible). Great way to read the bible daily and read it in one year. Would recommend the book itself (regardless of print type size) and devotional that goes with it to everyone. Helped me in my spiritual walk 200% !!!
5,"""Daily Bible: In Chronological Order...""","Excellent study guide! I purchaed from Amazon after discovering our local book stores didn't carry it - and it was so highly recommended I wanted to start 2012 with a new study. I purchased used book, which is in actually quite good shape, for a very reasonable price. And imagine my surprise when it was shipped promptly, as promised! Thank you so much."
5,The best devotional bible you can get your hands on!,"This bible truely gives you plenty of insight into God's word. Not only can you complete the bible in 365 days but you have the opportunity to have an eagle's eye view into the Word of God. Also, each day your quiet time is already planned out so you can remain consistant in your dosage of God's Word. It's is truely awesome and very on point. You will learn alot."
5,Read it in a year and loved it!,"This is the absolute best way to read and understand the Bible. It reads like a story. I looked forward to my daily readings. And I have bought it for a gift for another, recommended it to many!"
5,Brief and helpful comments put readings into historical context.,"This paperback edition is identical to The Narrated Bible, which he published in 1984 and dedicated to his father (a Church of Christ evangelist, who ""first suggested the idea for this book,' and to this mother, who ""taught me to love God's Word.""The Introduction sets forth his presentation, which ""rearranges the Scriptures chronologically in the order in which the biblical events occurred, and ties the text together with narrative commentary."" He uses the New International Version verbatim; thus, it is ""neither a re-translation nor a paraphrase. He concludes the Introduction: ""The sole aim of this book is to give the reader a greater appreciation of context, so that Scriptures can be both more meaningful and more enjoyable."""
5,Almost New,"Nobody even read it, I'm sure. The pages were pristine. I ordered it for an elderly lady at church who doesn't have the internet, and she was really thrilled. For a little over $5 she got an essentially new Bible."
5,The Daily Bible,"This is a great way to read the bible. Divided into daily readings and organized in Chronological order, so that it reads from the beginning Genesis, to the end in Revelations, but not in the same order as the books appear in a regular bible. This gives a better view of when what was happening."
5,Inspirational,This product has really helped me to stay on track with reading the Bible on a daily basis. I would highly recommend it.
2,good and bad,"Great size of Bible, the Bible its self is great. I have this Bible in the regular size, but the printing is just too small."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzz,"This set a record in my life's movie-watching experience: I rented it three times, always willing to give the benefit of the doubt, and three times I couldn't stay awake through the first hour.Asimov's story is a classic; this is a classic dud."
4,Another Nightfall,"Yes, I too would like to see the original story done (or even the novelization of that short story). But I am happy with this version. I like to think of it as one of the previous Nightfalls of that world.Remember that there were many Nightfalls. Differences can be attributed to whichever phase is being related. Names can be passed down from generation to generation. And even changed.The question then becomes, ""How many Nightfalls can be filmed?"" What about a future Nightfall which involves space travel to the occluding planet?"
2,Lareby has lost it,"I bought this film for the script writer: the great Bob Lareby, responsible for ""As Time Goes By"" and ""Good Neighbors."" Here the box declares ""Air Raids, Gangsters, Big Bands and Bombs."" Well, that's what you get, and very little else. The writing is alarmingly limp; for a comedy nothing here is worth a smile unless you still find chase scenes entertaining. The acting is above average, and a lot of money went into the project. But one comes away with nothing: no laughs, no depth, no meaning, not even a decent plot. You've been serenaded by Glenn Miller clones and seen a lot of period costumes and sets. Hey, I can see the real thing on the History Channel for no charge (except, of course, endless commercials). In short, don't start out with great expectations, as I did. Lareby and company have offered us next to nothing for our time and money."
5,GREAT!!!,I had seen the actual show and gave the DVD as a gift to a friend. She was over the moon and loved it!
2,Review of Cavalia Live,"We attended the show and enjoyed it - the Video looses the ""live"" aspect of the performance. It is definitely not worth what we paid for it."
3,review of this book,"The book was just ok I think I was expecting something a little lighter. He has a twisted sense of humor which most of the time I enjoy,but this did not cut it for me."
4,Terrific writer,"Englander know how to write great short stories with kicker endings. His subject matter is often kinky, but interesting. Read his other books."
5,Another good book,"Have read all of his books and highly recommend them: funny, caustic, intelligent. You must be a brave reader and welcome the challenge of his books, even if you are sometimes uncomfortable with the subject matter, you will appreciate the skill of his writing and how it makes you think."
5,Irreverant and engaging,"This is a delightful collection of short stories about God, religious Jews and their relationship to God and all the different ways that the relationship can go. I found it funny, irreverant, and very refreshing."
1,"High voltage, Low out put",My 18 volt Dewalt impact does almost as much work. I have many Dewalt tools and am very happy with them. This one does not get close to what Dewalt says it will do. Dewalt should pay me to test their tools.
5,Just plain Awesome,"Purchased two of these and they hit hard! It is very comfortable in the hand, as I said hits very hard, and they are quite rugged. They are used in a shop and in off-road racing and they stand up to the unintentional abuses of both. Battery life is also quite long. We will be purchasing more of these and Amazon has the best price."
4,"High energy delivery of music, dance and light","I enjoyed Turku. Music and dance were more than what I expected. If you are Persian, Kurdish, Azeri, Turkish or just love music and dance you will find lots of your favorite folk music and dance in this tape."
4,Program your CD player for tracks 1-11,"I wanted a remix of ""Cosmo`s Factory"" and I could not find the 24k gold disc at a reasonable price,so I finely broke down and bought this 40th.anniversary reissue of ""Cosmo`s Factory"".I am very happy with the sound of this CD.In my opinion the sound has more depth,not just more volume.I could hear a difference,not that the original CD release is that bad,but I will play this issue from now on.I had stayed away from this 40th.anniversary release for a long time because of the extra tracks.I like to put in a CD and let it play through,so I figured I wouldn`t want to hear the extra tracks each time I played the CD..I was right the extra tracks are not very repayable.I guess I will program my CD player for tracks 1-11 to avoid hearing the extras every time I Play ""Cosmos Factory"".Don`t get me wrong the tracks are interesting,but belong in a lost recordings set not on the classic album.Adding these extra tracks was kind of like painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa."
5,Quality product from Cosmo's Factory,"Creedence Clearwater Revival/ Cosmo's Factory: CCR continued their string of great albums with this Masterpiece, but it turned out to be the last great album they would make (there were two more albums to come). However, there is no sign of decline here as every song is a gem, most of them becoming hits, all of them getting great radio play, and all of them done in the best of that unique CCR style. This album is Highly Recommended."
5,THEIR PEAK,"Their peak music POWER ALBUM , starts off with the just the incredible,raw ,INSANE RAMBLE TAMBLE and then goes right thru the other classics. run thru the jungle,put a candle in the window,etc. get this album you cant go wrong ."
5,"Saved My Nickles,Dimes,&Quarters Till I Could Buy At Age 11!",Wow! This brings back memories. Bought the album back in 1970 when I was 11. I went home turned on my black light to light upmy fluorescent posters (remember THE CAT?)and played the album for the first time. Pure Bliss!
4,Blast from the past!,This took me right back to Jr High! I played the LP smooth back then. It's great to hear the whole thing again.
5,A great way to discover a great band,"Shows nada surf being fabulous performers live,because many of the songs sound even better in this live recording than in the studio version.Impressive is Caw`s voice above all,showing the "" popular "" emo kids that this man can actually sing.Shows too that they`ve permanently toured the world because both guitarist and bassist speak perfect french during the breaks.Recorded in Brussels, Belgium,Europe where they have a loyal fanbase.Includes "" popular"" played in a way much more indie pop than Weezer-like.Check out what a good live act is."
3,Okay,I found this a reasonable account but not as good asAtomic Power: Necessary Evil or Virtually Uncontrollable Force that's Wrecking the Planet?.
4,Pretty Good,"This game is pretty good although I never figured out how to do the jockey part. I favor the stable mode. It's not all that realistic but realistic enough. Although I agree that horses don't die so early because of natural causes. One of my horses is 30, the other 29, and my favorite died at 33 just in June."
3,It's Just OK,"How the heck are you supposed to win in this game? I was racing and my horse gets tired VERY easily, therefore I lose everytime. I've paced myself and still got in last place. It doesn't get much better when you play as a manager. It's confusing and took me a while to understand. Now. I've played every horse sim game around and I have never been more confused with this game. It would be a lot better if you could actually have instructions and understand it!"
2,You can not win!!!!!!!!,"Like one of the other reviews, great game but you cant win???Easy and hard are the same! I got this game as a present from a friend but it had no information on how to play the game.Can some one please tell me how to atleast come third and why does the energy level go so fast and the other horse's dont??Please reply!"
2,ANNOYING,This Game is the most annoying software. The races are nearly impossible to win. Your horse is always the one that tires at the end. TOO many horses in each race. Save your money on this TURKEY!!!
5,Game help and hints,at the start of this game chose stable manager then do not hire any staff or buy any horses. Build a clubhouse then you can board other peoples horses for money (this will build up your funds) once you have good enough funds you can start to buy horses and race them for money. Once this is done the game is a Lot more fun!!! (any more Questions or hints you need answers for e-mail me at girlhunter#220@yahoo.com)
4,pretty good game,"it's the best computer horse game out there, easily better than quarterpole plus or stable masters 2. the key to competing in this game is building boxes (stalls). people will pay you to board their horses; this will give you enough money to make it until you buy some real good horses. 200m = 1 furlong = 1/8th of a mile."
5,No Comparison.,"I bugged my dad since June 22nd, tha last day of school. I wanted this game. I read previous reveiws and thought the gamers must have been awfully pleased, so I had to have this game.I got it. I thought the store was going to have loads of them 'cause nobody where I live is bezerk 'bout racing, but after I got mine, three left.Previous reveiws told of how hard the game is? After you get the hang of it, it's really easy to make a lot of money. The only downside s that it's measured in meters.. I'm an American and therefore don't know the metric system for anything, but I figured it out.The graphics are very realistic and the sounds make the game sound like you are ctually atop the horse and as the jockey or on the sidelines.Definately not a newbie's game-before this, you may want to start with online games to understand how racing works, or you'll not get a fame rating of 3."
1,Bella Morte? More like Hello Kitte.,"So this is what passes for goth these days? Boyz II Men soundalikes (hell, just listen to ""Many Miles"") whose music gravitates between, well... Boyz II Men-esque soul/R & B synthpop, yet more industrial rock (because that's SO not played out by now), and eighties schlock rock. ""Goth"" may be somewhat of a subjective term, but this certainly ain't. Hey, young teen girls once thought Avril Lavigne was a rebel, so why not have young teen guys think Bella Morte is dark? At least their name's appropriate. Death certainly would be beautiful if it were an alternative to listening to this amalgamation of mallgoth."
2,as the reasons die so does bella morte,"bella morte has been my favorite band since before the quiet. and i have to say that i was disapointed deeply. as the reasons die i waited for so long for and then i get this? metropois has transformed deathrck at its best to front 242 sounding stuff. its not them, andy uses a voice mod. although they have a real drummer now, hes not featured on the album, he will be on the upcoming EP songs for the dead, released in nov. but REAL bella morte fans know this is not there best work by far"
4,appreciated the free price,"Lots of info for the price, thanks to all who sponsored this, plenty of good history here. Very good pick."
5,Awesome creepy book,"I adore well written horror and it is so rare to come by, I absolutely loved this book. It is not easy to creep me out, this book creeped me out good. There are not a lot of scary scenes in Shadow Child, the story is so solid it didn't need a ton of horror filler. After finishing the book I searched on the stone caves in New England, I don't think I could go near one after reading this book."
4,An amazing 'first' animation on Blu-ray,"I'm usually a person that has to see an anime, in any of its forms, before I buy it. I bought Tekkon Knkreet blind, and I am happy with my decision. Going into it, I knew it would be visually amazing from the trailers I saw when it was released in Japan. What I wasnt prepared for was a deep, emotional story that really pulled me in. The story deals with friendship, brotherhood, loss, the inexplicable, insanity, differing visions, and overall fighting for what you love and believe in. Even if you aren't a big fan of Japanese animation, but can take animation, and have an imagination, I definitely recommend checking out this title."
5,Teen aged fun!!!,My teenaged granddaughter and I loved watching this movie..we all know hard it is to get teen girls to watch anything these days LOL
3,"Amazing images, so-so plot","Even though I loved this director first American feature in the Animatrix I have to say I was rather dissapointed with the overall feeling of this movie. Great scenarios and control of the camera but sometimes the overall sluggish look of the characters got annoying. Also, even though this is an anime the movie was moving utterly slow."
3,nice PQ but....,"overall its a good buy, even better when its on promotionthe story goes abit out of hand @ the last quarter of the movie, i guess a re watch is needed to understand better"
3,intense and kind of cool,"but it wasn't enormously captivating. it has a good story and good visuals. the amazon review is accurate (for your information), if you have or have not read it. it is worth watching, but it did not thrill me. *shrug*"
2,A bit different,Rather than try and write a long review explaining point by point why I thought what I did about this movie I'm going to be short and to the point. TekkonKinkreet was a visually a beautiful movie and also incredibly boring. I sat through the entire thing in hopes that it was going to get better however it never happened. I'm surprised by all the positive buzz surrounding this film. Im sure others will praise it but for me it was a snoozefest.
5,Experience tekkon kinkreet in this amazing Blu-ray,"The film is by the Animation studio that brought us THE ANIMATRIX.Exquisite Anime with top-notch production value.""The lavish animation, layered with detail and subtext only hints at the complexities and inner character of this bold cartoon epic based on the underground Japanese comic by Taiyo Matsumoto."" by Home Theatre Spot.Blu-ray offers beautiful high AVC bit rate video encoding, frequently even above 30mbs, and many excellent audio tracks, including an English track in 640kbps DD5.1 and also the original Japanese language track in PCM.This blu-ray release offers lots of special features with Jave-enhanced capability that includes timecode and bookmarking.EATURES INCLUDE:- filmmaker commentary- 11 minute interview with director Michael Arias and British rock duo Plaid- 43 minute making of/director production diary- HD trailers for Paprika, Ghost Rider, Final Fantasy, Hostel 2, Underworld 2, and UltravioletHighly recommended!"
4,Great Film.,"Deep Storyline, unique setting,great soundtrack (by Plaid), interesting characters and art style... I thoroughly enjoyed this movie."
5,"Marvelous Animation, and Food for Thought","The quality of animation in this movie - aided by different lens effects as seen in movies as well as 3d-esque two dimensional art - is only surpassed by the touching and thought-provoking interactions between the boys Shiro and Kuro. This is a must-see for any fan of anime, but one should be warned that this film goes to dark places."
5,One of the Best Anime Ever!,When I first saw this movie I was like this looks really dumb. Then after I watched it I wanted to watch it over and over again. The plot is deep and the dub is perfect. The graphics are pretty good and the characters all have their own view of the world. I insist that you pick this movie up and watch it for yourself. I loved it.
5,THIS BOOK IS A TREASURE!,"I was fortunate enough to get this book at a bargain price, but would have paid full price with no regrets! How many books can you say that about? Creative, lush and gorgeous....leaves you wanting more. If only Mary Carol could produce an annual holiday publication!"
3,Pretty photos but not enough ideas,"I own several of Nell Hill's (ie: Ms. Garrity's) books and even though the photos in this book are as lovely as all the photos in the other Nell Hill books, I wish that Ms. Garrity had added more ideas. The opportunity was there."
5,Excellent,"This book as well as Style at Home are two of the best books to have for your home. As I live very near the store of Nell Hills and have been there several times, I can say that anyone who comes through Kansas City should make the short detour to Atchison for this store. It is well worth your time, and Mary Carol Garrity is one of the nicest shop owners to I've had the pleasure of doing business with!"
2,Too simple for the serious decorator,"I was looking forward to rec'ving this book based on the other reviews but ended up returning it. If you're a serious Holiday decorator, there aren't that many ideas (not worth the price of the book anyway). You can get more ideas out of a good Holiday magazine. Not a Santa, a snowman or vintage decoration to be had; this book is filled with natural flora and fauna for the most part.What really bugged me was the publisher kept recycling the same photographs - - the wall sconce filled with red stuff was in there on 3 or 4 different pages. That seemed cheap, like why not show different closeups?The decorating was pretty but generic. And not enough of it. I was dissappointed."
5,Beautiful.....................,"I love this book. It gives so many ideas on how to decorate for the christmas season. It's elegant, but not too over-the-top. I absolute love it and recomend her other book also!"
5,"Excellent gift, going to get one myself",I bought this as a Christmas gift (2004) and I have yet to see a bible so beautiful. The of God has yet to be written and bound so beautiful as it is in the Cambridge.
4,The Comics: Since 1945,"This is the companion volume to The Comics: Before 1945. If you love newspaper comic strips (which generally are not about costumed super heroes), you'll enjoy remembering these strips. Both volumes are loaded with samples. You might even be inspired to look for some reprints of your favorites. Some of the current reprints, especially from IDW Publishing, (The Library of American Comics), featuring Little Orphan Annie, Dick Tracy, Scorchy Smith, etc. have never looked so good."
1,Not Worth the Expense,"HIGH RATINGS OF THIS SOCK ARE DECEPTIVE, SAVE YOUR MONEY!My wife purchased these ""SmartWool"" socks and I purchased the men's SmartWool socks after reading many reviews of this sock.These socks are not worth the extra money that these socks cost.Are feet were cold during the two-days we used them while skiing. Cotton socks are just as warm. The SmartWool socks stay up but so do my cotton socks. The extra material in the shin is unnecessary. If your shins are sore while skiing, buy new ski boots or exchange your rental ski boots for something that has better padding. The contention that the lighter material in the ankle is something spectacular is over rated.My every day cotton socks perform as well at a fraction of the cost.HIGH RATINGS OF THIS SOCK ARE DECEPTIVE, SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
4,Allen Meyers does it again,"I was fascinated with this book because I grew up not far from where this picture was taken (although many years later).Allen touches upon history, both Jewish and non, and gathered many rare photographs for his series of books on the Jewish settlements in Philadelphia, PA. (In this book, I found a school picture of one of my great-aunts.) I found his history of the area to be on target (if a little fluffy at times) and, in all, enjoyed his accuracy.Pretty good read."
4,JESUS Name Above All Names,"This is a book that I have searched for in the Christian bookstore here, but never could find it. Found it easily on Amazon.Book arrived in excellent condition and time since I needed it by a certain date. I am very pleased with the service as well as the book I purchased. I have never been disappointed with Amazon.....they always have what I'm looking for and send it out quickly.Thanks for the great service."
1,Unimpressed.,"My husband ordered this as a gift. Per the description ""brews 60 cups,"" the photo, and the price, he was expecting a more impressive gift. In the fine print, you'll notice that this is ""5 2 oz. packages."" In other words -- $45 for less than a pound of coffee. In addition, he paid extra for overnight delivery and received a notice that delivery would be delayed. While it did arrive in time for the occasion for which it was ordered, it was not overnight. Overall, not pleased."
1,Policosanol doesn't work!,"Seven independent, well-conducted scientific studies in the U.S., Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, South Africa, and Croatia since 2006 have found policosanol worthless at lowering cholesterol levels. Virtually all of the positive ""evidence"" for policosanol comes from a single Cuban research group which has a financial stake in the product. Even One-A-Day has given up on policosanol and switched to phytosterols!"
4,Another great read from an excellent author,"I have read most of Elizabeth Chadwick's books (two to go - which I have purchased) and looking forward to her new one in June 2013. I love Mediaeval history and she presents it in such a way, it is hard to put down. As her novels progressed and with more experience and extensive research, Elizabeth Chadwick's books became biographical/historical rather than historical romance books. She can tell a great story and make you feel a part of that time. I thoroughly recommend this and all of her books."
3,entertaining but no where near the best of Chadwick,"I am a big fan of Chadwick and other prominent historical fiction writers. The story is entertaining and certainly well written, it is by far not my favorite and feel the plot kind of dragged on."
2,At least I was able to get through it....,"This is not the first Elizabeth Chadwick book I have ever read, (thank goodness) because I would probably not pick up another one. The characters are one-dimensional, the fight scenes confusing and disjointed, and the ending was disappointing. There was not a steady sense of rising action and climax, but rather spurts of action and long strings of boredom. The love between the two main characters is believeable, and I think that is the only thing that kept me reading this book. Try one of Chadwicks other novels, or if you want really really great fiction, go for Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series."
5,Sherman & Fiedler together - WOW!,"Years ago (I lost count) I owned this recording on 8-track cassette. I've been searching for the past 20 years or so, trying to explain to friends what a treat it was. Today, on a whim, I visited amazon.com and got a very pleasant surprise. A superb recording, to be enjoyed by lovers of classical music, musical comedy, general humor...hell, anyone that appreciates beautiful music and enjoys a good laugh..."
5,"finally reissued, a gem","This was until recently unavailable, but no longer. This was Allan's only live album, with no less a back-up band than Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops. It has been very nicely remastered and is packaged with new liner notes explaining how this wonderful partnership came about. I only wish they had reproduced the orginal liner notes inside the booklet, as they are tiny and very difficult to read on the back of the CD. If you like Allan Sherman you must have him here at the pinnicle of his talent."
5,Very cool whistle,"We have a collection of sound makers for our sons' instrument collection. This a very well-made, low-pitch slide whistle. We all love this."
2,Not the best for music classes...,"I teach elementary music and have been using a cheap slide whistle to encourage my students to match pitch and explore vocal levels. I thought it would be a great idea to invest in a 'better' instrument, but have been very disappointed in this particular whistle. As another reviewer mentioned, the high pitches are totally lost, and the lower ones get airy. The whistle only works for about 75% of its range. I am not sure why a cheap plastic one would work so much better, but it does. This one definitely looks better, and is more impressive, but if it is pitch or exploration you are working with, this particular instrument or brand isn't your best choice."
4,The Let's Pretend Whistle,"The metal slide whistle I ordered from Amazon was purchased by my radio drama company, The Midnight Mystery Players, for two performances of Let's Pretend, a classic children's program from radio's golden age. The slidewhistle was utilized in the original to let listeners know when magic was occurring: when listeners were goingon a trip to the magic land of Grimm or Hans Christian Anderson, or when a character appeared or moved rapidly to another place in the story. In ""Beauty and the Beast,"" the whistle told listeners when the beast turned into ahandsome prince."
4,Metal slide Whistle,"It's a fine instrument. I would only wish to have a wider range, but for our needs in the band by now it's good!"
4,Beautiful and philosophical albeit slow and confusing,"I read through the reviews and found all of the various interpretations of this complex movie to be valid. Still, I don't know what to believe! However, it doesn't detract too much from the film unless you need some concrete plot and a linear storyline. I picked this up for two bucks in a Big Lots (sorry Amazon) and consider it a hidden gem. There is much to savor in this movie, from the controlled acting to the breathtaking scenery to the philosophical jewels scattered here and there. I think my favorite was the line ""a lover is a mirror that allows us to see who we really are"" or words to that effect - I apologize for the lack of a photographic memory. It is because of moments like these that I sat through this slow-moving tale and would do so again. This is a great movie to see with your own mate as it might provide some wonderful opportunities to chat and discover yourself in the mirror of your lover."
2,Boring!,"Zhou Yu's Train is a very slow film without any real narrative flow. It is also over-long and exceedingly boring. Close-up shots of Gong Li ""thinking"" or slow motion shots of her running seem to go on forever.My main problem is that Gong Li's character comes across as a selfish and spoilt bitch. Just because she is beautiful and everyone wants to ""have"" her does not make her likable?She sleeps with a man and when he asks the stupid question ""Do you like me or the poet?"" She replies quite coldly the poet. This is almost verbal castration and extremely cruel.The film is beautifully shot but the settings are cold, ugly and modern.This film so wants to be a poetical and profound but really is nothing more than a humourless and far from entertaining exercise."
2,TRAIN IN VAIN,"Part of the problem may be Gong Li's superficial performance as a young artisan in love with a poet. She flirts well with the camera but does little to reveal the complexities of her character, likewise her dual role as an older woman who serves as narrator of the film, is lacking in depth and conviction. Beautiful cinematography and thoughtful editing can't make up for the overall emptiness of the film."
3,Beautiful but. . .,"If you wish to view beautiful cinematography--the powerful, lyrical shot of the train tracks converging, then separating then converging first comes to mind--this is a film to see.If you wish to view a beautiful woman--is there a more beautiful woman than Gong Li?--this is a film to see.But do not expect a fully realized story or neatly expressed--or even understandable--emotions. Watch, don't think; appreciate, don't demand."
2,Zhou Yu's Train Wreck,"If you liked Gong Li's previous movies you'll hate this one. It is a tedious story of constantly oscillating emotions in a pair of romances that are hard to care about. Gong Li's title character does little but ponder her life and kiss a few men. The photography is beautiful. If someone gives you this movie for Christmas, go ahead and watch it, but turn off the sound and subtitles."
3,Nothing spectacular but worth a view,"I've always liked seeing flicks with chicks that kick a**. Thus, my spirits were high going into this film.Reading the description on the box pretty muched summed up the whole film. IT'S A REMAKE OF LA FEMME NIKITA. Not that this is bad, it's just that it isn't very original.Yes, Jade does most of her stunts, and quite impressive to say the least. I just wish that the character could have been devolped more in the beginning of the film so we could feel for the character more.Nothing groundbreaking, but still deserves a look."
2,Disappointing...,"This is a far inferior Hong Kong re-make of La Femme Nikita in which Jade Leung plays ""Black Cat"", a young drifter who is trained as an assassin after being taken into a secret organization. Leung is decent in her first role, but plays the part mostly through facial expressions - there aren't a lot of lines for her. Simon Yam, who is always fun to watch, plays her boss. Expect a lot of Hong Kong style action, with over the top violence and brutal fights. Unfortunately, the acting by the Caucasian cast is absolutely dreadful and seriously detracts from the overall movie. Pretty mediocre movie in the long run."
1,Dead Cat,"Whereas Point of No Return was basically La Femme re-heated and served covered in ketchup, this piece of junk is LFN sliced and diced and made into a horrible stir-fry. Really bad foreign flick, at several points it's college-level filmmaking... at its worst!"
2,Yet Another 'La Femme Nikita' remake,"Sigh.If first you succeed, try and try again.That's the motto of filmmakers around the world apparently. All we need now is for someone in India to make 'The Killer from Calcutta' and we will have seen every major movie industrial machine on the planet shoot a version of the same script.If you liked 'La Femme Nikita' in French (the original) and/or the Hollywood remake ('Point of No Return'), then maybe you won't mind seeing it a third time, this time with a Hong Kong sensibility. Me, I think enough is enough. Let's move on already!('Black Cat' should probably get One Star, but I have to give the crew credit for some impressive stunts. The actors were also less-than-horrible, but no one really rose above adequate.)"
4,Entertaining Gift,"I purchased this book as a gag gift for a coworker who was incapable of accurately reciting turns of phrases and idioms. He seemed to like the book pretty well, but it was also missing a few things that I thought should be included in a sort of ""top 101"" format like the book has. In any case, it was well-received and will hopefully be well-used."
5,The best idiom dictionary that I have EVER read!!!!!,You have to have it! A must read for any fan of the American English Idiom world!!!
3,"Excellent appearance, the content is not that great","The appearance of the book is excellent: both the graphics and the audiotape are excellent ways to help you learn the expressions. However, during my stay in the US, I found that most of the idioms are rarely used.If you are a foreigner, and want to learn how to speak American English, get 'Street Talk 1' instead."
4,Some did not work!,"As soon as I read this book I used some phrases to my friend, who is an American lawyer obtained a degree from Duke grad. No doubt she is intelligent enough. But some of them did not work. For example, she did not understand ""dressed to the teeth"" at all. Because I used it at our friend's wedding party, the situation was perfect to use it. In addition, I wrote them down for fear that she had not catch them correctly because of my pronounciation. I found that some of others also didn't work. I wonder if some of idioms on this book are obsolete. But, generally, it seems to be useful."
3,The audio tape was a cool feature,"I loved the audio tape feature, but I was disappointed with the idioms that were chosen. If you were only going to teach 101 idioms to someone coming to the U.S. for the first time, these certainly would not be the first ones I would choose. The illustrations are helpful, but this book is much shorter and less useful than many others in the genre. I would suggest buying one of the much larger ""idiom dictionaries"" for someone who is coming to the country for the first time, because they will teach you the more regularly-used idioms. Hope that helps. Enjoy!Todd HagopianPresident/CEOHagopian InstituteAuthor of the popular ""Quote Junkie"" book sereies and the brand new ""Idiom Junkie"" series"
2,Basis book,"Tear inside binder of the book. It took almost 3 weeks to receive the book. If anyone who just wanted to learn English slang words, be sure to search for a better book than this one."
3,"Good, but publicly available on the Web","I find this book a good mate for everyone who likes more reading on printed paper rather than a pc screen.Through the pages you'll find plenty of examples and advices, expecially in the FAQ sections, but on the other side every single word is already available on the samba's official site.Maybe, if this book was cheaper, people could buy it and place it on their desktop as a trusted fella."
5,Solid History of the Annihilation of Germany's Army Group Center,"Excellent, concise history of the bloodiest campaign in WWII. Superb color maps make the actions mentioned in the text easy to follow. Great collection of photos, too."
4,ELECTRIC RELAXATION,"This is one of those cd's that you can relax & chill to.Fat Jon & J.Rawls put together a nice cd although I like their work with Five Deez & Lone catalysts better.If your 25 yrs old & up & tired of commercial hip hop,pick up this cb as well as Five Deez & Lone catalysts"
4,comfy and cute,"I read a review somewhere that they were disgusted by the way the boot looked when they got it delivered...It looks exactly like the picture, so you either like it or you don't. I spent about 8 hours in them on Halloween night and they were comfy all night. It would be kind of hard to tuck jeans in them though cause they are pretty tight around the top. I would say they run true to size and I was happy with my purchase!"
5,Reading this book should be Required,"Well first of I would like to say I have been ready plenty of interracial romance novels, but in the last couple of months I have not felt compelled to right a review about any recent books I have read until NOW. No Commmitment Required was a fantastic book. At first I couldn't really get into it, I was even making fun of the characters but somewhere in between Michael professing his undying love to Yvonne and Yvonne finally opening up to Michael I started taking this book seriously. I really felt like there was a connection between the two of them. And after reading this book, I felt like I had to talk to someone about it that's when I knew I had to write this review."
5,Unexpected Love,This was an awesome book with a believable storyline. After reading other interracial book I was kind of hesitant to read the book. But curiousity had me reading non stop. I love how the author did not put a lot of focus on the couples race. Of course there were some incidents involved but that should/could be expected.Micheal was a man of your dreams. He was truly there for Yvonne and she was able to heal with his help. The relationship moved at a good pace. All of the characters were well developed. I think there should be a continuation maybe with Micheal and Yvonne's best friend.
3,I gave it three stars...,"I gave this book three stars ...really 2 1/2 out of five...because it started off REALLY good. I was going to write a review halfway through exclaiming how great the book was....Then about halfway through it became a little difficult to read.There were alot of really cute parts to the book. And alot to admire.It dealt with issues of dating outside of the race genuinely. If you're in such a relationship you can definitely relate. But, the deal breakers for me were the way the characters began speaking to each other in really sickening phrases and Vonne's and Michael's choices that created unecessary drama. There were too many occassions that made my eyebrows slant down and my mind scream, ""you've got to be kidding me!""Really who talks like that? And who hurts someone they love to avoid having that person make a difficult choice? Does that make any sense?There were a few typos, but the typos didn't overshadow the stupidity."
1,Very Disappointed,"When i saw this book on Amazon and read all the positive reviews I ordered it right away and could not wait to read it. Boy was I disappointed. This book was trite and cliché i could not even finish it. The descriptions of the heroine was one of the main thing that turned me off of this book. Not only is she described as being beautiful, petite and has caramel complexion, but it turn out that she was also a virgin. Why must the heroine of IRs always have a caramel complexion or light skin or be biracial. The author makes it seem as if white men are only find black women attractive if they are light skinned.Not only that but i felt that there was no real chemistry between the main characters, the pacing was slow and the sex scenes really drag.Now i'm the type that usually devours IR but this one i could not get into at all. Save your time and money and skip this one."
2,Hard to commit to reading this book...,"I love romance books. I am especially impressed when the lovers have difficulty getting together and even staying together. The process of falling in love and working out differences is entertaining; especially so if humor is used to advance the plot.No Commitment Required, by Seressia Glass is not an easy read. It was cumbersome and hard to maintain the attention of this reader. I was especially disappointed with the character development and even the storyline. Most disappointing of all was that I wanted very much to enjoy this book as much as I enjoyed the book, The Color of Love, by Sandra Kitt or others I have read, I simply did not enjoy this book at all."
5,FIVE STARS ARE NOT ENOUGH,"Beautiful!!!! This book was so wonderful, Yvonne and Micheal were beautifully written characters. You could feel all the emotions Ms. Glass wanted you to experience reading this book. The pain of their pasts were believable, just as the love that they finally shared. This was a beautifully written story and I hope Ms. Glass continue writing stories as powerful and wonderful as this."
3,Good ...But,"This novel had potential, however I could not empathize with the main character - Yvonne and her rather irrational behavior stemming from the accident that killed her parents and twin sister. Not wanting to love Michael because she felt her love would destroy him like it did her family and her coach was just ridiculous. The issue of race (Yvonne is black and Michael is white) although mentioned was not an overriding issue which was a plus. I however do not buy the over 30 virgin and the man feeling annoyed and put-out by being given such a ""precious "" gift - this is the 21st century for God's sake. The issue of Yvonne's best friend being in love with her was a stretch and was thrown in it seems to prolong the story. Overall a good novel that could have been better by making the heroine less irrational."
5,Great Book!,"I was thoroughly satisfied with this story. I had read Three Wishes before this one came in the mail, but it was worth the wait and the reviews were helpful. I of course liked Michael, he was a great male lead and Yvonne had some serious issues, so he gets mad kudos for that one."
4,Can't judge a book by its cover...,though you'd think that the graphics department was po'd with the author for putting such an unattractive cover on this lovely book.I found that this book by Seressia Glass along with Three Wishes were really good reads. I'd have given it five stars except for that darn cover!
5,Excellent Story,"First of all I must say that Mrs. Glass is an awesome writer and is now my favorite. ""No Commitment Required"" revolves around Yvonne and Michael. The two meet when their best friend, Jeff can't pick up yvonne from the airport and Michael does it for him. The attraction was instant and from then on they began to desire each other more and more. Everything seems right, except they both suffer emotional scars from the past which puts a struggle on their relationship.The question is can they overcome the pain of the past in order to procede to the future? The story is overall beautiful with some parts that might make you grab for a tissue."
1,Not worth your time or money.,This book was horrible...It takes a lot for me not to finish a book. Yvonne was too whinny and the story line was boring. This will be the last book that I ever read by Seressia Y.Glass. Not worth your time or money.
3,A Little Disappointed,"The book started off strong and kept me interested but there were little things I could not get over. There was a comment said by Mike the main character that he ""wasn't expecting an African American."" Her (the female lead) reply was ""my parents aren't from Africa."" Reading that made me cringe. It just sounded so ignorant.Her breakdown over the events in her life were just a little much. It wasn't realistic, and she was so needy. I mean she couldn't function. I could deal with the story until that part, then I had to put it down. I have just read better."
5,I had to be hooked up to a heart monitor!!!!,"This book was too hot to handle!! I thought I had found a gem in reading Sandra Kitt, but I definitely found a diamond in Seressia Glass. This book was written so well! Mrs. Glass needs to give up her day job and take on writing full-time.The storyline was great, the characters were great, the drama was great, the sex scenes were GREAT!! Everything about this book was above par....My recommendation to all readers is: Buy this book! You won't be disappointed."
4,Will quench your thrist for passion and suspense!,"When it comes to interracial romance stories the pickings are slim in the literary world, especially when it comes to white men and black women. I have to say that Ms. Glass creates wonderful characters that the reader cares about. And she is not afraid to write about SEX and lots of it! After I read this novel I kept going back to it to read some my favorite scenes between Vonne and Michael. You actually believe that the two characters fell in love with each other, albeit with hesitation because of their wounded pasts.Great read!"
1,Unrealistic,"The book just left me feeling flat. I couldn't relate to Yvonne on any level. We've all suffered pain, tragedy and loss. Yes, it hurts and it devastates your life but you have to move on. Yvonne was content to wallow in her self imposed, self pity. I couldn't empahize with her charcter and I kept wondering why someone as wonderful as Mike would put up with her.I felt cheated. This book was not worth the time or money I invested in to it."
3,Its alright..,"Its my first amplifier so I don't know much about them.. It didn't cost much, I paid $50 for it 2 years ago. I have it hooked up to 2 7"" MTX truck speakers, I rewired them so that the tweeters would run on the stereo's built in amplifier, and the subs would run on this amp. Like I said, its alright. Nothing spectacular, It hits, but doesn't sound the best. I just bought a 1,000 watt 2 channel Lanzar amp, hoping it'll perform better.I should also mention that the amp NEVER gets hot, I guess that's a positive.."
2,Worked okay pushing a RF P3 sub for about 6 months...,"When pushing a Rockford Fosgate P3 wired to 4 ohms, the amp would overheat and turn off after about 30 minutes of use. Eventually, it just gave up and never worked again."
4,How many light covers are included?,"PIAA 45102 510 Series Black Mesh Style Lens GuardIt is not clear from the Amazon description if this item includes 1 or 2 covers. I called PIAA, and they confirmed that they are sold as single (one cover only) units."
5,Not Just For Music Historians,"It's almost hard to believe all the acts that have fallen between the cracks in Country and Rock history. This stunning collection is a reminder that indeed, Rock and Roll Never Forgets. Besides stellar live cuts from Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and Gene Vincent are a host of others giving their all on the Southwest version of the Grand Ole Opry and the Louisiana Hayride. Divided in to 2 Discs- Hillbilly and Rockabillies you'll find yourself wondering what happened to names like Charlene Arthur, Sherry Davis, Tommy Mitchell and The Belew Twins. Thankfully the excellent liner notes have info on the whereabouts of these and others. For those of you wondering if the history of Rock has already been written, its collections like these that remind us that there's still a lot to be uncovered."
1,Bad surprise from a prestige brand,"In terms of design and ergonomic (is very confortable on the wrist) I am very happy.The big negative surprise is the accuracy, each 24hours it adds 20 seconds , what is unacceptable for a $1000 watch.Because I order from USA to Europe the return is a problem and the warranty is not valid because Amazon (seller) is not an authorized agent.It seems that this problem is common with TAG watches."
2,My reasons for 2 stars,"The watch I received was sharp in appearance. The 41 mm design was classic, and I think it could be worn in multiple occasions. However, I had some concerns about the particular watch I received. This Aquaracer is described as having a unidirectional rotating bezel. The one I received had a fixed bezel. That in and of itself gave me enough concern to return it. I was also concerned about the watch band. This may be unique to Tag but the band felt hollow. It did not have a solid feeling, and had no weight. There are advantages to a lighter band, but it did not feel right with this particular watch.."
4,Film done where we were raised,"I bought this as a christmas gift for my son who was raised in Germantown, we all sat and watched it that night, had fun trying to guess where things where. Within the week he had found the main house and stated that it looks just like it did in the movie. We are wondering when the movie was filmed. The movie itself was enjoyable but relationship to the area is what made it for us"
1,Sound quality horrible: Watch this anywhere EXCEPT Amazon,I've never had any problems with the sound on Amazon-streamed films until this one. I first tried speakers with the sound set at 200% and could barely hear it. Then I tried headphones and that was worse. I can't comment on the quality of the theatrical film until I rent it somewhere else so I can actually hear it. Someone at Amazon needs to fix this.
4,DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH,Nice little movie I wasn't aware of. Very good performance from Mackie Washington and Pierce. One of those rare pleasant movie surprises.
1,"Poor information, no practical method and many stories",The secret of this book is that it has nothing to practice inside but old huna story telling and no practical steps at all with no up today experiences as there is no clear method.The Huna method is not here either.Too overrated.
5,"Very useful tool set, excellent value","For me, the main reason to purchase this tool set was to build the Costco SUNRAY playground playset in my backyard.As a new homeowner myself, I did not have any tools. And this is the list of the Required tools from Costco for building the playset:Tape measure, Carpenters level, Claw hammer, Wood clamp,Standard cordless drill with medium Phillips bit,1/4"" and 3/8"" ratchet,1/4"", 7/16"", 1/8"" drill bit,7/16"", 1/2"", 9/16"" deep well socket,9/16"" box wrench.I expected to spend two hundred dollars in Homedepot to have the complete set. Luckily I checked Amazon first and found the Allied 39025 tool set.Sixty dollars and three days later, I have almost every tools I need.I am no expert on tools, but after three days of intensive use, I feel this tool set is very solid, especially taking consideration of the value.The drill is very powerful too.If there is anything more I'd hope for, it would be an extra battery. But with the current price, I have no complain."
3,Nice hand tools but drill is weak,I bought this set because it had a wide variety of hand tools and a cordless drill. The tools are very useful for lots of minor miscellaneous repairs around my apartment. My only complaint is the drill. It is very weak and isn't capable enough for even simple tasks. I ended up throwing the drill away and purchasing a seperate high quality drill. The tools are great just dont expect much from the drill.
5,Perfect,"This is perfect for the person that wants every tool to fix something around the house. There are many reviewers on here comparing this to a tool set that would be designed for building, that is not fair and you cannot fault this set for that purpose. Of course there is no framing hammer in here because it is not for building!Perfect set...everything you need for a perfect price.Tools are held in there places strongly."
5,A Must-Have for the Ducatisti,"Even if you own every other Ducati book ever written, this is THE book to own! In association with the Ducati factory, this book shows their bikes in the factory museum. Well written with new information and exceptional photographs unlike any other Ducati book I own. Features the factory race bikes with some excellent info and photos of the standard bikes. Text is in English and was printed in Italy. EVERY motorcycle enthusiast should own this book. The best book bargain out there when purchased on Amazon. I was so impressed I bought two of them!"
2,Lack of range,"This wrench is ok. Its chipped and dinged after minimal use, and doesn't open as wide as most 12"" wrenches. Good beater wrench, that's about it."
3,A very limited Odyssey,"Lynn Paula Russell is unquestionably an amazingly talented illustrator. That, I am not questioning. Nevertheless, this book is not as extensive as the title suggests.The first half of the book is a collection of drawings with a general topic in common: Corporal punishment. This collection is accompanied by some comments on Ms. Russell's own sexual history, or if you want, her own sexual odyssey. It is evident she has some sort of fixation with the submissive side of BDSM. Particularly, I would say, she likes being spanked. At least that's what you may guess from this part of the bookThe second half of the book is a collection of short comic stories. The kind you could buy by fifty cents if you know where to go. Neither part is particularly appealing for me."
2,Decent drawings but the story is lacking......,"I bought this book to help my daughter with her fears of going to daycare. This book was recommended by an article i read on the problem and how to deal with it. We recieved the book and i have to say, i am pretty disapointed. The drawings in the book were nice but the story, specially the ending, was pretty pointless. It does a decent job of showing the childs fear of his parents leaving him at his baby sitter, but the ending, where the child realizes everything will be ok is just shown in pictures and not text, therefore the person reading the book has to explain to the child why the boy in the book is happy to be left with the babysitter. I could have gotten the same thing by just sitting down with my daughter and trying to explain things. If you are looking for a book to help ease the fear of going to daycare or a sitters buy the book The Kissing Hand by Audry Penn, it does a much better job."
1,"The ""Good Bye Book"".","This book was surprisingly bad. With my daughter going through separation issues this was recommended to read to her. Well, it's totally not helpful and seems like it's made more for adult humor. The sarcasm and negativity that pretty much is the content of the whole book except for the last page. I think it unintentionally encourages the reader to have new ideas/ complaints as to why the parents shouldn't leave him. Could be funny for adult but not for a kid who is really trying to work through something."
3,love for the down home sound of tyhe christianaires,"i think this is an excelence album i love all the cuts.i particularly like, aint no way ican lose. and, god stepped in on time."
4,Super Cute,"Bought this for our 18 month old. It took her a few tries to find all the items, but once she did she really enjoyed going back to see them again. Bear in the Big Blue House and the characters are really cute."
2,I wanted to like this,"If I wanted to watch high school students being annoying I could probably just go to the Youtube. I think where this fails is that there are so many students profiled that it's hard to show anything in depth. Some of the students definitely have lives of struggle but you only get a surface view of how the feel, what they think, how they cope etc. It's a very shallow view of the students."
5,Awesome!!! Hard to Find!!!!,"Pack of 9 really means 18 in total. Got 18 of them! That's less than $2 a 2-pack!Being a neat freak obsessive when it comes to dental issues, these smilies make me smile.Well packaged.Fast service!I will order from them again :-D"
1,good response from keyboard and mouse but...,typing is not fun. the keys are very stiff. typing is tough. ONLY buy this keyboard if you are not gonna use it for a lot of typing. i gotta go ice my hands now.
2,disappointing,Erratic connection problems. Keystrokes are intermittant at times and mouse is slow to respond.
1,Quit working after 6 months,"I'll never buy another Kensington. The wireless mouse went after a month. So- I used the regular mouse and was happy with the wireless keyboard. Then -the keyboard went. I checked batteries, connection, etc. It's broken. Not abused - nothing - just stopped working. Now I am back to buy another wireless - hopefully better quality like the Logitech I bought for my laptop."
1,Don't buy,"I've had it for less than 6 months, it's battery consuming, heavy, and very glitchy. The response is horrible, and the scrolling wheel broken within 4 months. Not a quality product, and expensive. Bad buy."
2,Too herky jerky - but a nice looking and comfortable set,"The missed keystrokes are too aggravating to recommend this otherwise understated and comfortable keyboard/mouse combo. (The foam-filled faux leather wrist pad is a nice touch).Like when you are ""holding"" down ctrl to select multiple items, and the signal (okay, I just spent 15 seconds holding down the space bar there to get it to recognize) interupts and starts your selections over...The range is much better than my MS laptop mouse, but that's about all I can say for it. Originally I was going to give 2 stars, (and this would be a 5 star if it worked properly) but the more I think about it, the less acceptable the dropouts are.Back you go..."
3,"Keyboard is awesome, mouse sucks","Saw this at Fry's and had to have it, so I ordered it from Amazon. The keyboard is amazingly quiet! Unfortunately, at the same time, the mouse clicks are deafeningly loud. Not a good pairing. Sure, I could use another mouse, but the nice thing about the pair is that one little USB stick will receive signals from both of these units.Unfortunately, my keyboard was flat-out defective and had to be returned. Would not communicate with any computer, even though the mouse worked just fine. ReStockIt was the Amazon.com merchant that shipped it to me, and they did refund my money, but took their sweet time to do so. Their shipping was hecka fast, too bad they shipped me a garbage keyboard!"
2,Can't discourage enough,"I, like so many others, thought 'WOW! What a deal' when I found this laser keyboard/mouse combo for only $30 after rebate. I usually use Microsoft's wireless kb/mse, but figured that with a 33' range, I could use this unit with my media center. NOT. The keyboard misses keystrokes and the mouse gets jerky and misses clicks of the buttons. So, I moved it to my desktop with a 3-4' range from the USB transmitter. Same problems. Do not buy this set unless performance is NOT an issue and you don't mind slamming on the keyboard to get it to type. Next garage-sale, it's gone!"
2,Dissappointed,"I ordered this product based in part on the positive reviews here. When I began to use the keyboard and mouse, I was very dissappointed in the mouse operation. The cursor arrow was somewhat difficult to control and for no apparent reason. I was also unhappy with the comfort of the mouse in my hand. On the plus side, I thought the keyboard was comfortable to use, but the mouse was the big reason for the purchase and that just didn't make it for me."
1,Works Intermittenly,"I loved the feel of the mouse and it has been ok but the Keyboard has been horrible. It started with the letter M sometimes not working then it spread to the 10 key pad and so on. No help from their website. NOTHING!!! 60 dollars, Wow. Not again."
5,Buy this!,Beautiful singing and music you don't hear every day. Every time I listen to this CD I play it twice.
5,It made for a great gift.,"The person I bought this for loves it. The quality is good, it's very light and comforable to wear, the clasp is secure, but still easy to operate."
5,It's the best,Grease fire? A simple way to prevent grease from heating to that point is to add water to the drip tray at the bottom. Another benefit to this is that it makes clean up easier. All the food I cook in this unit is perfect.
5,Awesome product,"Octavia from Maryland said it all. Follow the easy directions to load your food and let ""da boy"" do his thing. Two thumbs up!!"
1,Try using it for a while and you'll see why it's a ripoff.,"I have bought two of these, and both have broken down after a short time. The first one disintegrated around the slots that hold the door pegs. Seems like it can't take the heat. But because I really liked the quality of the food that it cooked, I actually gave it a second chance. The second one had what appeared to be a metallic-like outer skin, so I was hopeful that the same problem wouldn't occur. It didn't; another one did. The heating element stopped working after about six months. Two in the trash heap is enough for me. Beware."
4,Ronco Oven,"Overall this product was remarkable. It cooked the best prime rib I have ever eaten, but their is a downside to this oven just to let you all know. The oven is not as smoke free as it is shown in the infomercial. When we were cooking a prime rib roast, the whole first floor was engulfed with a thick smoke similar to cooking with a wok. You maybe saying that I did not read the instructions before using it, but I got other people to look at it and it is just the way it is when the oil falls onto the tray and evaporates due to the hot temperature which produces smoke. By smoke I do not mean like the kind you get when you burn wood. Other than that the oven performed very well from what I can see.Unfortunately, I used this only 6 times, the rotating motor failed. The heating elements will not work if the rotating motor fails. Because it costs so much to repair, we rest it to the landfills. Do not buy."
1,Not well made,"I have had my rotisserie for about 3 years. After the first month the leftt side hinge broke off, and gradually others broke off, I picked it up and the base broke and it fell to the floor, I believe the screws on the bottom were too tight and this caused it the base to keep breaking."
5,A GREAT INVENTION,I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL ABOUT BUYING THE ROTISSERIE & BBQ. I HAD READ THE REVIEWS AND ALMOST DIDN'T OBTAIN IT BECAUSE OF ONE REVIEW. THE REVIEW STATED THAT THE ROTISSERIE STARTED TO SMOKE.YOU DO HAVE TO READ THE INSTRUCTIONS AND VIEW THE VIDEO. THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE VERY EASY TO FOLLOW.I HAVE COOKED A CHICKEN AND PORK CHOPS AND THEY HAVE BOTH TURNED OUT FABULOUS. I LOVE THE ROTISSERIE IT AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE. THE CLEAN UP IS SO EASY.THIS IS ONE ITEM THAT IS TRUE TO ITS CLAIM. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT AND CAN HARDLY WAIT TO USE IT AGAIN.
2,Not a good first impression,"I haven't even used it yet and already give it a low score. First, the door does not stay shut and it hit me in the head while I was trying to store it above the counter. And second, it did NOT include 3 accessories that were clearly stated on the box as being included! Unfortunately, since I didn't purchase it-- it was a gift-- I cannot get replacement parts unless I buy them. Not a good first impression!!!"
1,Ronco Showtime Indoor Rotisserie & BBQ,I rate this product minus 4 stars - ****Well it started out to be a Great Christmas day untill we used the Ronco Inventions ST1000 Showtime Indoor Rotisserie & BBQ.We bought a nice beef rib roast (8lbs) for dinner with the intent on using our new Ronco Inventions ST1000 Showtime Indoor Rotisserie & BBQ to cook it. What a mistake! after watching the video we carefully put the meat on the wheels making sure that it was balanced properly. We then placed the meat into the Ronco Inventions ST1000 Showtime Indoor Rotisserie & BBQ and watched it cook. After about an hour we noticed that the meat was no longer rotating as it should! The motor died and because it was no longer turning the meat the meat started burning on one side dinner was ruined!!!!!!!! Thank you Ron Popiel!!!!This is supposed to cook a 15lb turkey I wouldn't bet the farm on that!DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
5,Very pleased with this product!,"I have seen this product on the infomercials for quite some time and decided to give it a try. I've had my rotisserie for about a week and have used it twice for chicken and once for steak kabobs--with delicious results. The chicken was crackly on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside; the kabobs were cooked to perfection. The oven does get very hot, so with that caution, I highly recommend this product and plan to use it often."
1,Save your money,"This gets WAAAAY To hot to have safely on a kitchen counter. It is also hard to clean and cheaply made. But my main concern was how awfully hot the outside of this thing gets. Be sure you have this up and away from children or anyone. The cooking times were also much longer and the only thing we thought was good at all in here was chicken. Did not live up to all the TV hype, of Set it and Forget it,,,,,,, I would Never buy another nor recommend."
4,"Good, but could be better.","After seing it in an info-commercial, I have decided to purchase it and give it a try. At first, I was rather pleased... but after several uses... the machine started making squeaky noises as the wheel would turn. After that, I noticed that the built-in timer wasn't accurate. The metal vegetable compartment is a real joke. Vegetables turn out dry and the container is cheap. Cleaning is a lot of trouble. The metal reflector behind the element becomes very dirty & practically uncleanable.The good side to the rotisserie is that the poultry comes out delicious. On the other side... shrimps & fish are less miraculous. Them too, become very dry.Another bad point to the rotisserie is that the metal structure around it becomes extremely hot, making it dangerous if you would accidently touch it while it is in motion.Thus, I give it a 4 on 5 because of it's convenience... but not 5 on 5 because of it's small defaults in the construction."
2,"good advertisements,bad product","I FIND THE PRODUCT WILL WORK IF YOU DON'T MIND DEALING WITH A BULKY OVEN WITH WAY TOO MANY MOVABLE PARTS. YOU DON'T JUST LOAD UP THE OVEN QUITE AS EASY AS IT'S SHOWN ON TV. YOU WOULD NEED AT LEAST TWO MORE HANDS AND AN EXTRA COUNTER TO WORK ON.TRY GETTING THE RIBS OFF THE DRUM IF YOU CAN WHILE THEIR STILL HOT,OR GETTING ANYTHING OFF THE SPITZ.TRUST ME ITS NOT AS EASY AS IT LOOKS ON TV.EVERY WHERE YOU LOOK IS WARNINGS ABOUT GETTING BURNT AND THE DISTANCE YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT FROM EVERYTHING MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO USE ON YOUR COUNTER. IF YOU GOT EXTRA MONEY TO BLOW HERE IS THE ITEM TO BLOW IT ON. THANK GOD FOR GOOD ADVERTISEMENT COMPANIES OR THE MAKERS OF THIS PRODUCT WOULD BE OUT OF BUSINESS! THIS IS MY OPINION AND I'M SURE IT'S SHARED WITH MOST OTHER BUYERS OF THIS OVEN."
2,"Tastes Fine, Not worth the mess or the bother","The taste is fine, but it is not worth the mess. Long cleanup process and it smokes enough that we have to use it outside. Not worth the price."
2,Cooks ok but construction lacking,"I have had my Ronco Rotisserie for about 3 years now. It does a good job on chicken, roasts etc. However it is very messy to clean. Also, maybe it was the one I got but it just was not constructed sturdy. After about the third use, the knob cracked in half. We glued it together and so far it has held up. Then chunks of it have been falling off the back--the part where you wind the cord around. I don't beat it up so I don't know why that would happen. I do love food cooked in a rotisserie but I will not be getting another Ronco. The construction could be much better than it is."
2,I found this movie boring and very slow moving.,This movie moved so slow. I kept waiting for it to get better... but it never did. Skip it. ZZZzzzZZZzzzZZZzzz
5,It was pretty good.,I thought this movie displayed typical marriage issues. I'm not married but have friends that are and can see alot of them in these characters.
5,Great Movie,This is a great movie for married couples.It was hilarious.But did not like the way Vivica looked on this movie . She looked very fake. Most of all the characters in this movie was great and it was well worth the money spent.
1,Waste of timer,I thought that this was sooo poorly put together I felt like I wasted money on the entire shippment. Great actors and actresses but poorly written script.
3,Good date night movie,The production is the only thing holding this movie back. The acting is great and the story is wonderful. Nice pick for the price.
1,Stupid,"Sorry I wasted time and money. With this cast, you'd think a better project would have been made. Sorry, do not recommend."
1,Horrible!!! Waste of Time!,"I was appalled at how horrible this movie turned out to be. The cast was amazing, and I expected so much better. The story line made no sense, the plot was not well thought out. This movie was horrible and a waste of time. No wonder it went straight to DVD."
2,More action would have earned more stars,"The movie plot looked so tired and dumb that I assumed there would be a lot of good ass-kicking and people getting their heads blown off. So I rented it. To be sure, there were some cool fights, but long, tedious scenes of the ""top bad guy"" yelling at his inept henchmen and plot over-development kept the fireworks from happening until the end and even that was a little weak and stunted.The plot device that kept getting in the way was the hallucinagenic drug theme. Snipes' character, Dean Cage, is injected with a drug that makes him believe he's in a past combat situation and his friend is in danger. Any suggestion is automatically believed - at one point he's told ""You're on fire"" and immediately we see his legs burst into flame. That was sort of neat, but they bang on this drum and rely on the theme that Cage is a poor hapless dupe so much - so sad for a renter who expected to some serious ass-whooping. Should have read some other reviews first, I guess!"
3,Same plot as every other movie.,"Same plot as every other movie. Snipes is a cop/soldier/person that can fight/etc. Someone is trying to kill Snipes for some reason. Snipes fights a lot, blows up things and uses guns. It was boring and not well acted. The plot has been overused and the acting is not very good. This may be one of Snipes worst films. Thank God he now has theThe Blade Trilogy (Blade/ Blade II/ Blade: Trinity), otherwise we would be seeing him in a lot Movie-to-TV or DVD movies.Snipes has some really good movies (Passenger 57), Unstoppable (also titled Nine Lives) is one of those movies he should have never chosen."
4,SLOW BY MODERN STANDARDS,"Wesley Snipes is an ex-special forces operations and is having a hard time adjusting to his civilian life. He is in love with the girlfriend of a man he had ordered to die. While waiting for her at the Chesapeake restaurant, he is mistaken for someone else who is supposed to be waiting there. He is injected with a powerful hallucinogenic drug which works off the power of suggestion. Snipes believes he is back in a Bosnia prison as the bad guys attempt to extract information from him, which he doesn't have. Meanwhile the CIA show up disguised as FBI. The movie takes place in Baltimore (at night) so we don't get to see much of the city. No sex. No nudity. No super special effects. It does show the mind play and hallucinations going on in Snipes head fairly well."
2,Wesley's Worst,This has got to be Wesley's Snipes worst or one of his worst movies.I didn't like the whole hallucinogenic thing.This movie just dragged.I had a hard time finishing it.
3,Unstoppable,"Not a great movie but the cast makes up for this B actioner with Wesley Snipes. When ex-soldier Snipes is injected with a halucinagenic drug he relives a bad mission in Bosnia making it difficult for those trying to sell the drug. They must try and cover their tracks as the CIA closes in on their deal. Many recognizable faces in this well paced movie. If you enjoy action movies I suggest you rent it and you may find it worth owning. If you enjoyed this catch ""Terminal Velocity""CA Luster"
2,Waste of money,"This barrel is a bad choice, it is less accurate that the stock barrel, even at twenty feet, the rifing just causes every other shot turn left or right by a foot or more. I should have gone with my gut and not wasted the money, don't waste yours!"
1,The Bane of My Mathematical Existence,"If you are in charge of designing curricula for your Place of Higher Learning, please don't force your students to use this book as anything more than a doorstop. It's full of text, 70% of which is unnecessary filler. One of the author's favorite pedantic methods is using the phrase ""convince yourself that [some mathematical idea is true]"" instead of actually proving it. This might be acceptable if the author had balanced out the massive seas of empty text with massive seas of examples. But keeping with the theme of the book (""useless""), there are few examples, which are what usually makes a textbook valuable.The one bright spot is reading the uncomfortably forced praise on the back cover."
2,Go look for another book,"Gives way too many proofs for someone starting out in Multivariable calc, i found that Thomas Calculus had a better way of explaining not only proofs but a lot more examples and simple techniques on how to do equations, unlike this book where no other way of doing equations is explained. Personally i got lost the first time i read through this and when i had other books like Thomas Calculus i got it right away, i strongly would not recommend this book, unless your a math nerd."
3,Good introduction.,"This book is a good introduction to calculus in higher dimensions, but thats all it is, an introduction. It lacks a bit in terms of theory, and mostly focuses on chug and plug type methods, which is fine for an introduction, but if your curious about learning more then look elsewhere."
5,Beyond music...,This is so far my most played Mina CD ever. I have had it for 6 months and I am going to have to purchase another one for it is almost scratched. My second favorite is Olio.
3,Just OK. Not worth the $$,"I bought this as a gift for a 4 year old. It arrived promptly and looks adorable. However, it is fairly rough feeling and was not packaged in a way that would be suitable for gift giving. I took it out of the plastic bag it was in, to try to make it look cuter in a gift bag. That's when I noticed the horribly strong chemical odor coming from the product. I'm sure it is due to the plastic bag it was stored in, but it's really bad. If it doesn't air out in the next couple of days, I will not be able to give it to the intended child and will be asking for a refund."
5,Awesome Watch,I bought this watch because it is a very attractive looking watch plus I wanted a big watch. I couldn't be more happy this watch is HUGE and has some good weight to it. I am extremely pleased with this watch!!!!
4,It's a BIG watch...,"...which is exactly what I was looking for. Nice and heavy it has a real air of quality to it, the bezel has a really solid click on turning and basically the watch is a rwal presence on your wrist.Very happy with my purchase."
1,Meter Leads,"4/15/11 they have already gotten an open. Had to splice the wire at the probe, then it got an open in the plug end. Had to splice that end.pretty crummy leads."
3,Sizing is not correct,"These handles are not bright white they are off white, also the sizing says 9 1/16 on center and they really are 8 7/8 on center. We had to drill new holes to make them work."
4,SWANN Wide-Angle Cam,"This is a good all-around indoor camera. It uses an RCA connection, so if you are plugging into a DVR that uses the CCTV-style connection, you will need an adapter. I got the adapter at Radio Shack for a few bucks. The ""wide-angle"" lens was wider than standard, but a bit dissapointing for me. I got around this by moving the camera back until I could see what I needed to monitor. Overall, this is a great little camera for the price."
4,Excellent choice in this price range!,"I recently upgraded all my cameras in my business to these (I previously had the Swann B&Ws; which lasted without problems for 6 years). An excellent color camera for this price range - much better picture quality than many of the others (Q-see!) of similar cost.It is very small and discreet and my B&W; Swanns were very reliable for a long time. Very easy to connect and produces a very good quality picture. Only issues - (1) definitely needs a lighted area - don't try in darkened areas - (2) not a real wide angle on the lens, and the changeable wide angle is not much wider (although changeable lenses are available like the extra wide and the fisheye) - (3) audio mic is not great.Still a very good camera for the price. A reasonable quality option for home and small business."
3,Mini cam,"This camera is nice and small as stated. There are two things thatI do not like. first, the camera needs a ton of light to get a goodPicture. Second, it's hard to keep the whole frame in focus."
1,what you get is NOT what is pictured,it is a small mini camera that is not in a housing at all.There is no housing with LEDs go to the swann website and you can see what you really will get.
4,RE Lee HQ,This was an unusal find I was not familuar with thi flag and i wanted to add to the ones I have It looks greatand of good quality.
5,Bach Trumpet Mouth Piece,I have been working on the Trumpet Voluntary by Clark for my son's wedding & this mouth piece makes hitting the higher register very easy without lip fatigue. I highly recommend it for the price.
5,Bach Trumpet Mouthpiece 3E,This is an exceptional mouthpiece for marching band and anytime you need to play a lot of high pitches.Highly recommended!!!
2,The mystery is no mystery,"""Mystery of the Pyramids"" is a short documentary about famous mysteries of Egypt. This video explores more than just the pyramids at Giza. Omar Sharif also talks about the Sphinx and Tutenkhamun's tomb. He over-dramatizes these ""mysteries."" In fact, most scholars of Egyptology are in agreement that there is little mystery in when these monuments were built and who built them. Sharif also expresses his own personal views of the pyramids and the Sphinx, trying to convince the audience that there is some mysterious reason for their existence. Also, he examined the ""curse of the mummies."" This discussion has no basis in reality, and in fact is just wild imagination. I recommend viewing this video only if you want to be humored by Sharif. Don't watch this video expecting to be enlightened about the pyramids."
1,Song List Not Correct!,"Some of the songs listed here are on the CD... others are not! Roses, Sweet Music Man and What Do You Say are NOT on the CD. Instead, Because of You, Love Needs a Holiday and You're Gonna Be. Your Quality Control of listings need work!"
4,I bought this for Rabbit in the Moon,"I spent a lot of time and money searching out all of the Rabbit in the Moon releases back in 1994 through 1998. Even though I'm not a big fan of Keoki, Rabbit's remix of Caterpillar is always a fun listen. It's so good that it was even used in an episode of the Simpsons. Remember the one where Grampa tells Bart his war stories? It ends up with them rescuing some priceless paintings from the sea. When they bring them up, the cops turn the paintings over to some German guy. When he hops back in his Mercedes and turns on the radio, it's Rabbit in the Moon's remix of Caterpillar."
1,not suitable!,Can this product be suitable for purpose?On application there was a stinging sensation and after two applications the whole area was very painful and i discontinued the treatment
3,Hopelessly out of date.,"This book was written a good many years ago. Though it was a very good book about Mac games and goodies when written, everything in it is outdated. Please don't buy it. You'll be very disappointed. (I know because I wrote it.)"
4,No more microwave interference.,Buttons are easy to read. Good reception both indoors and out. Wide volume range. Initially purchased the base unit and a single handset. Plan to order two additional handsets.
1,AT&T Phone,This phone was of very poor design. If trying to hold on shoulder phone would hang up. If picking up near the volumn control on side of handset phone would hand up. No redial on phone. Did not like this phone at all. Have returned.
1,Packing it up and sending it back,"After about 15 minutes of use, voice quality rapidly deteriorates to the point that conversation is impossible. It then stays in that state for at least a day. Returning it to Amazon."
1,Bad phone,"I bought this phone as a christmas present for my mom who's old one stopped working . I loved the look of this one and all the features it had.. she chargesd it and checked the connections but it doesn't work.. only the speaker phone works .. so dissapointing .. is it too much to ask that a phone actually work?? i should have bought a uniden like the one i have, its' worked great for 6 years never a problem"
1,Phone doesn't work.,"I bought this phone because my old one was pooping out. This phone doesn't work. The handset will not charge. I assume the battery that came with it is bad, or possibly the whole handset is defective. The base works very well, but is not really useful without a handset. I will contact the seller next week (it's Saturday) to try to resolve this problem. But I wouldn't recommend this phone from this seller since the components clearly have not been checked. Luckily, my old phone started working again, at least for the time being."
5,at@t e59175.8 cordless answering system,it is one of the best cordless for the price. WELL PLEASED WITH IT.
1,Worst place to buy stuff,"I purchased ""AT&T; E5917 - 5.8 GHz Exxpandable Cordless Answering System with Dial-In-Base Speakerphone"" recently, but it was defective. The handset did not work....only the base part worked. So I requested for exchange. But they said there is no exchange, so I have to return on my own return shipping money. It was big money for nothing for me.So, if you are lucky to get the right product, you are fine. But if anything wrong with the product, then you end up paying the return shipping charge without any of your mistake. So i would not recommend people to buy anything from this merchant. There are many other merchants who take full responsibility if product is defective."
5,Great Phone,After two years I finally found a phone that works for me. I thought I had a hearing problem or phone line problem because no matter what phone I purchased they all were the same with low volume on the handset and the voices on the speaker base phone were not clean. This phone has a clear sounding speaker on the base phone and the mic picks-up my voice all around the room. The only problem that I have experienced is the buttons on the base phone need to be pressed firmly in order to make good contact when dialing a phone number. With all the features that this phone has to offer I feel it was a great purchase.
1,Defective Battery,"The AT&T cordless phone would have been great...if the seller (Antonlin.com) had not sent a dead battery. Seller would not replace battery therefore, I had to purchase a new one at a cost of $14.95. The product itself now works fine. I would avoid buying from this seller, Antonline.com"
3,Feedback about AT&T E5917,"I read good reviews about this phone, so I ordered one from[...] since they were selling it at a good price. I got a non working product. The handset was not working after charging for 16 hours as specified in the manual. I contacted [...] and they simply asked me to ship it back. Later I found that many people had the same bad experience buying from [...]. They ship faulty product. Dont fall by the few dollars savings from [...]. You will get a faulty product and waste your time and money. I have ordered many electronic items from Amazon and this is the first time I am getting a bad service."
5,beautiful watch!!!!,Very beautiful watch! My fiance loved it! Would buy from this seller again in a heartbeat!!!
2,Just to let everyone know.,"Tag Heuer says on their website that they have no online authorized dealers. Since this is not an authorized dealer, Tag can not gaurentee its authenticity and the warrenty from Tag does not apply. A watch this expensive is an investment so make sure you are getting the real deal, warrenty and all."
4,Laid-back vibes with something for everyone,"This Cd is very much in the same vein as the Buddha Bar compilation, mixing different styles of music. Never agressive, never boring, it's like a cross between Café Del Mar and Buddha Bar. You may not know the artist names, but you'll get the atmosphere of Paris' coolest hotel (and its resident DJ Stéphane Pompougnac) straight away. Definitely a CD for cooling down after a hard day's work, or great background music for that special dinner party!"
5,Upbeat Background Mix,"I use this as upbeat background music whenever I have people over to my house for dinner or to hang out--it's a very consistent level of sound and movement. It's got this weird (but effective) mix of jazz-like, bosa nova-like tunes that have good energy but aren't distracting. Listen to the first two or three samples. If you like those, you'll definitely like the rest of the CD."
5,Stephane Pompougnac doesn't get any better than this!,"I have all of his collections by now, and this is the one I keep coming back to. Airy, romantic, urbane, delicious, it always makes me smile. Hotel Costes 9 is also great, and individual selections off of the rest of the series are also excellent. But this is my favorite of them all."
4,Paris Under A Groove is better,Paris Under a Groove has cooler tracks and more funk in the mix than thi fancy prancy chi chi thing. People need to groove wiht Paris Under A Groove. It was recommended to me on Amazon.
5,Makes me miss Durham :(,"Though I only lived there two years, I've often yearned to go back to Carolina. This book made that yearning into a painful ache! How many cooking books do you read with the intensity of interest as a thrilling novel? I did this one. Warning: This is not a recipe book. Yes, of course it has recipes, from both eastern Carolina and western Carolina barbecue traditions, as well as some variations of both. But the stories and history of this book make it a treasure in my collection. This one is going into my library, far more worthy than to be consigned to the kitchen to collect dust under the microwave (a fate deservedly given to a certain book by Martha Stewart).This book makes me more homesick than ever for my adopted home. If you have any glimmer of passion for Carolina style barbecue, you MUST get this book."
5,Superb writing -- Makes you hungry & happy,"A superb piece of work by a wonderful writer, this book gives you the history and background of NC bbq, plus all the information you need to either produce your own or get out and find it in NC. The man knows what he's talking about -- and he talks it so well."
1,Bait and Switch!,I ordered a micro USB to USB cable and they send me this crappy A/B cable.What a rip off! I have ton of these cables! I need a new cable for my cell phone to my PC not this printer cable!JS
1,Unneccessary addon,"This USB-2 cord was promoted as bundle purchase with the Canon scanner, implying that it was a necessary accessory. However, the scanner comes with a perfectly adequate USB-2 cord, this would only be needed if you had a need to have a scanner 16 feet from your computer - unlikely."
1,unneeded item,"I ordered a scanner with the requisite cord. The scanner was out of stock, but the cord was shipped. I was charged for the shipping to return the un-needed cord since I ""no longer wanted the item"". Not very happy with this.Regards,Betty"
5,"Great length, works perfectly","I am using this cable to connect a hub near bed for using my mouse and keyboard, having the pc in the front closet, works great."
2,Not a 16 foot cable,"I bought 2 of these cables and the bag has a barcode label on one side that says it's a Belkin 16 foot cable but on the other side of the bag it has a simple label that says ""15FT"". Pulled the cable out of the bag and it measures 15 feet. I doubt the cable's even made by Belkin unless there is some guy named ""Wu Chong Belkin"", or something like that, at the factory in China that made these. Who knows when you've got a flood of Chinese counterfeit goods entering this country every day."
1,not as desribed,"the description was for a 16ft belkin brand usb cable, I received a 15ft monoprice usb cable. I'm not going to mess around with returning a five dollar item, but seriously? the cable that they sent me can be had for $1.83 on monoprice.com, I ordered a Belkin cable because I know they are a high quality product. Blatant false advertising."
1,WONT WORK & NOT BELKIN!,"#1 this does not work (using MacBook PRO 17"" with my Canon printer) (note: both work with another USB cable I have)#2 Title says ""Belkin"" but this cable is NOT Belkin# Return shipment is over the price of the purchase!Horrible experience..."
2,phony cable ?,advertised as a belkin cable. no tags or markings to indicate that it was any different than a bootleg cable. i think i got a generic cable.
5,High Quality Cable,"Unlike one review I had read, this cable is easy use and does not ""coil"" as someone else had said. It works very well for me in a situation where I have a computer some distance from my printer and my printer isn't a wireless one."
3,"decent product, not as advertised","purchased from amazon third party. product description states ""Gold-plated copper contacts minimize data loss"", the product (per belkin product number) is not ""Gold-Plated"", the information on amazon is incorrect."
1,Did not receive a Belkin Cable,Advertised as a Belkin cable but got a no name cable in a plastic bag. Obvious cheap construction and not the usual Belkin. It's not worth returning but I won't be buying from this seller again. Belkin should take steps to protect their name. These guys aren't selling the real deal. I'm surprised that Amazon doesn't vet what their sellers do when the fulfillment is by Amazon--I've got a lot less trust for this type of deal from now on.
1,Didn't work,"Didn't work. Threw it in the garbage and bought:Cables To Go 13401 USB 2.0 A Male to B Male Cable, White (16.4 Feet/ 5 Meters) (Purchased on 11/09/2010)by Cables To Go.It worked fine."
1,Do Not Order from Margin Mart,"Beware the false advertising.Do not order this product from Margin Mart through Amazon Prime Fulfillment. I was very disappointed in the fact that the cable I received was not a Belkin cable. It was a generic cable in a clear plastic bag with a laser printed label on the outside indicating the description at the top of the page. Considering that I paid less than $6.00 and had this shipped free via prime, it would cost me more to deal with the return than just move on. So I have moved on."
5,Belkin F3U133-16 USB 2.0 A/B Cable (16 Feet),"Belkin F3U133-16 USB 2.0 A/B Cable (16 Feet)Excellant service, Good product"
1,"Doesnt work, cant go over 10ft with most devices","Bought this cable and unhooked the device from a 10ft cable, windows couldnt recoginize the device. Hooked up the 10ft again, no problem. Tried a few other devices with the same result. Turns out most devices have a max of 10ft. dont buy this cable, it doesnt work"
2,Not a Belkin brand cable,"Not a Belkin product. Belkin cables have lifetime warranty and have stamped and molded Belkin logo. Product was a generic manufacturer USB cable, not the higher quality heavier gauge Belkin product. Amazon was fantastic with prompt, free return service."
1,Defective cable,"Cable arrived defective, open wire or bad solder conection, wasted almost an hour troubleshooting my new scanner because I assumed the cable was good. Did not return the cable because postage would have eaten up any savings. I assume that their cables are normally good but it looks like one slipped through QA/QC."
5,Excellent value and just what I needed.,I needed a USB cable to connect two printers in different rooms using a 2/1 splitter. This product serves well for data transfer involving mostly text but also some pictures. The price was right. Pricing was much better than some of the local box stores in town. Service by this vendor was excellent. I will be back to this seller for my hardware needs.
5,Best Item Bought,We needed a longer USB cable for our shipping computer to our printer.This has been the Best Item Bought. It has never failed and it has held up.Belkin F3U133-16 USB 2.0 A/B Cable (16 Feet)
5,"Good quality, sensible price","A USB cable is essentially a commodity. There is a minimum standard of acceptable quality, anything above that is unlikely to be beneficial.This cable comfortable exceeds the minimum standard of acceptability, and it's price is a whole order of magnitude cheaper than it's competitors in stores."
1,NOT A BELKIN - Crappy Quality,"I should have read the other reviews. The cable MarginMart shipped was NOT a Belkin. Tried it on my printer and printing stopped halfway through. You can tell it's a fake because Belkin cables have a distinct color and shape - see the photo in this listing.Belkin cables are thick and grey with fat figure-eight connectors. This cable is a cheap looking thin black cable with small molded connectors. Belkin cables have the word ""Belkin"" molded on them and a part number on the cable. This has no words anywhere. Belkin cables come in Belkin packaging, This came in a plastic bag with a fake Belkin sticker on it.Stay away from MarginMart. Go buy somewhere else."
4,Non Wireless Printer needed the longer cable and this satisfied the need.,Needed something over 12 feet and this satisfied the need at a great price. Unfortunately the printer died from the aftermarket Brother cartridge so replaced with a new wireless printer.
1,RIPOFF,I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT WHICH IT SAYS BELKIN USB CABLE...WHEN I GOT IT IT WAS A SIGNAL POINT USB CABLE WITH A CHEAP LABEL STUCK ONTOP THAT SAYS BELKIN.THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY ARE SELLING YOU A NAME BRAND LIKE BELKIN AND GETTING A CHEAPER BRAND LIKE SIGNAL POINT WHICH COSTS LESS IF YOU WERE TO ORDER IT UNDER THAT NAME. IM GOING TO LET BELKIN KNOW WHAT THEY ARE SELLING CAUSE THAT IS COPYRIGHT INFRINGMENT.THEY ARE RIPPING PEOPLE OFF THAT DONT KNOW ANY BETTER.
1,long usb cord,tried to use this cord for a printer that I wanted to move to a different part of an office but it didn't work. The cord was a bit worn so perhaps that was the problem
4,"Nola J. Gove, Marketing Director","This is a very good printer for personal printing. The continual ink replacement if used for printing CMYK documents can be very expensive. This printer uses small indvidual cartridges, and it will not print near as many copies as a group/office printer that uses individual toner cartridges. We bought it soley for printing labels for CD's and for that I give it an A. We also used it for making labels for our product and we had a solid color background. It would only print 15 letter size copies before it called for ink.I read in a previous review that some one else bought it for making CD labels as well, but they claimed it had limited capabilities---that is not true. If you have PhotoShop you can do anything that will fit onto the CD surface.But do not try to print full surface solid colors, it eats up your ink quickly and can be very expensive."
2,14 day DELIVERY!!!,The item is fine .... I guess it's Amazon! I had the printer within one week but the cable I had to have for the printer took more than two weeks! Got it on 7/22/08. I NEEDED a cable more than a week ago so I had to buy one from a local shop. Now I have the Amazon cable and don't need it! Amazing. What good is a printer if you don't have a cable. I am done with this Amazon crap .... never complained until now. Should have ......... dot dot dot
2,Got what I paid for...not what was advertised,"As another reviewer said, Margin Mart does not ship the grey Belkin cable that is shown but rather a cheaper quality no name cable. I had wanted the grey to help identify it in the cable maize behind the computer but I got another black one that looks like all the others. It's also very light weight. It will probably work and considering how cheap it was it's probably a good deal..just not as represented! With the free Prime shipping it's not worth pursuing but I just want all to know that the picture and description is not what you will get from Margin Mart!"
4,Cables! - When you need them!,"UCB cables are indispensable items in the 21st Century. You need them quickly? You get them quickly! Excellent product, excellent service, excellent speed."
5,Long cable is long!,"This is great if you have a big desk and your USB cables aren't reaching, or even if you have to reach another room. I accidentally ordered two, but now I'm using them both, and they've both performed fine. At the price Amazon is selling them, they're definitely worth it!"
2,Nice Price and Product........but too long for printer.,"I ordered this cable for my Canon Pro 9000 inkjet printer so I could extend the reach from my laptop. After trying many times to install the driver, I found out that the printer cannot work with a cable longer than 10 ft. Just to prove my research from other message posting that this was true, I hooked up the printer to a shorter USB cable and the driver and printer installed perfectly. Hope this helps others who might have wanted to do the same thing. I will just keep the cable and use it for some other device as the price is so low that it is not worth shipping it back."
5,Bargain cable works just fine,Works great with my Canon printer. At local stores all I could findwould cost 30 bucks or more. Great buy.
4,"Worked fine, first time.","This product is not rocket science, but there can be concerns with long USB cables. Note that the bandwidth standard is USB 2.0 (480Mbits/sec), so may not serve ultra-high bandwidth applications. But absolutely fine for printers (and most anything else the average person would use). I had it connected from an old Gateway Desktop to a newer HP printer, and like I said: worked fine, first time."
1,Does not carry a signal,"After trying to use this USB cable on multiple computers TO several different accessories, I've finally given up and determined that the cable just DOES NOT WORK. The signal just does not carry from the computer and is more-than-likely a result of a cheap product."
1,Defective Cable,"Received a defective cable. Spent hours trying to figure out why my printer would not print, then I finally tried another cable and it worked fine. After plugging this cable into my scanner, it just caused it to connect and disconnect ever 5 seconds.Disappointing. I would cost me more time and energy to return it at this point."
