4,GTA Rocks!,"Great game, similar to all the other GTA franchise. Great story, same game play mechanics as the other GTA's, Cool missions. Multiplayer wasn't as great as it should be. The characters were both too powerful. However, I'm reviewing this game 2, 3 years after I bought it so it was actually something cool during that time. For now, just save your money and buy GTA 4 for the PS3 or Xbox 360."
1,why put GTA on the PSP?,Why would Rockstar bring a GTA game to the PSP. Now there is no GTA game coming out for the PS2 or the PS3 this year. Now this is probably a great game but I don't want the PSP beaus the people who make PSP games or Sony don't like to make games for the PSP. So this game gets only one star.
2,This game is a disappointment!!!!,"I bought the PSP mainly for this game. I loved the other GTA's and was shocked to find that this game really stinked!!!!It took me approx. 6 months to beat the others, but this one, HAH....it took me 2 weeks.As for any sexual content. The only things that I found was the normal prostitutes that you could pick up.You could not design your character ""Tony"". You cannot design cars, etc.The difference is that there are new jobs that you can do. You can be a car salesperson, a motorcycle salesperson. And then the normal firefighter, policeman, and taxi driver.The missions are pretty easy to complete.Personally, I think this game is a good rental, but not to buy!"
1,Questionable Reviews,"How can you write any type of a review on a game, when its not even released yet? To many people are writing reviews on PSP games that are not yet released. Could some of you come from the companies that make these games? I WOUNDER"
1,more of the same,"same cartoony graphics, same cheesy blood, same cheesy concept. It gets old real fast."
1,"Wow, this is slow","I'll stick with ridge racers, wipeout, and lumines at this point. I'm not a huge gta fan anyway to get that out of the way. This game looks to much like gta3, and if you thought it was sluggish on the ps2, you haven't seen anything yet. the frame rate is absolutly horrendous. The graphics would probably get a 7 or 8 though. I guess if you're a diehard gta fan. You should probably buy this game. I'll wait for socom though."
1,GTA: Over rated.,"Everyone says this game and all the others are so fun and you suck if you don't have it. Well i don't have it and to tell you the truth if I did it would be the same as giving $50 dollars to a rich guy. The game gets old really fast. Every single edision is the same just a different place. It's all sex and killing, wow does life get any better? The reason why our nation is loaded with criminals and terrorist is because kids grow up playing shooters and their parents played shooters and they get used to it..like it's their life. GTA: im not saying that playing GTA will make you a terrorist but there are so many other games that are way better."
1,disappointing...,"it's supposed to be the killer app for the dying psp. oops. i had hope for this one because vice city was the only good gta game (gtaiii and san andreas= very overrated and very poorly done). i'm afraid this one is quite disappointing, although its graphics are almost as good as the horrible san andreas's (the worst ps2 graphics of any game). many people who held on to their psps hoping it would get better are now in line at their local video games store trading them in for the much superior nintendo ds and a pack of gum. the psp is dead in the water, and the xbox 360 just might do the same to the ps3 and its hard-to-program-for architecture. sony= the new sega..."
1,Came Broke,"The UMD came split, at least i am getting a refund. I was so excited to find this game at such a good price, but i guess it was to good to be true"
5,Just what the doctor ordered !!!!!!!!,"Well, rockstar has done it again. I've been obsessed with this game, the loading time instant, the minigames are great and you won't believe how amazing the graphics are. I didn't know it was possible to fit so much on such a small counsel. Although I did have to get the hang of the buttons you'll get use to them in an hour are so. But I haven't mentioned the greatest thing, there's multiplayer like you've never seen it before, talk about tech. I played with might friend and we had a great time, so buy this game. It's the best game out for PSP and will be for a long time."
4,Help for my arthritic fingers,"I was prescribed ring splint to help keep my fingers from deforming due to arthritis. I find that they are comfortable, easy to wear, and accomplish the purpose. I was surprised to find that they also helped to ease the pain from arthritis in the fingers with the splint - much better than needing to rely on drugs to handle the pain."
5,Counterpoint,"If you've ever wondered what happens to souls before and after this earthly incarnation, then this book will stimulate your juices and keep you thinking. Even though this is a work of fiction, I think many of us may have had experiences in our own lives that make us think this story may hold more truth, than just one man's imaginatiion. I was facinated, and couldn't put it down until I finished. Very thought provoking and may leave you looking for more insight. Maybe Mr. Phelps will provide us with a future installment."
5,Good education movie worth its price,"Atomic Age Classics is a well selected series to education school age kids. It's nice, classic, and fine selective mini movies to teach our kids good manners in a natural way. Both my preteen son and I enjoy it very much and decide to watch it again. It is even better for elementary school kids. It's especially helpful for kids with some social difficulty by natural or culture."
5,Good quality matte for 8x12 picture,"This matte was perfect for my 8x12 pictures. Looks really nice with the brown, wood grain frames that I purchased."
2,Biblical Holidays or Traditions of the Holidays?,"I was extremely dissappointed with this particular item. The cost of the book is not worth it. The authors claim to make efforts to educate people on the biblical feasts, but have included an immense amount of information that is rooted in cabala without addressing it as such. As a parent who purchased this book in order to supplement the teaching of Truth, I was dumbfounded by the authors lack of research concerning the roots of certain celebration practices. My own elementary school children were able to pick apart the errors in teaching and doctrinal half truths. This book should come with a warning label. If you are pursuing information on practicing biblical feasts the Jewish way: Buy. If you are interested in information on Biblical feasts: Walk! Just as there are many pagan traditions in ""Christian"" holidays, there are just as many pagan traditions in the ""Jewish"" holidays. Buyer be aware."
4,A must have!,This is a fascinating book. It is an excellent resource for those wanting to learn about the biblical holidays and their significance and reflection of Jesus! It has lots of info on how to observe them and even projects and games for kids. This book is a great investment and I highly recommend it. I as a Baptist Christian have had my eyes opened to a new understanding that I was missing out on before because I didn't understand the Jewishness of the Bible which makes a great difference in Bible study once learned about!
2,Not so much of a fit,"Great idea. Double sided tape is surprisingly strong. However the mirror does not fit within the edges of the enclosure on my 1997 Silverado. I was able to get the mirror to stay in place using the tape, but its obviously rigged if you look closer."
3,1989 chevy k1500 mirror,It did not fit my truck. However it is listed for my type of vehicle on the back apparently they made two different mirrors for my truck so I can't fault the seller.
2,Good text; horrible illustrations,"This manual was disappointing.The text is detailed and thorough, and provides quite a few techniques. Judged by the writing alone, it's a good book. Unfortunately, the excellent writing is completely overshadowed by the wretched illustrations.The book is devoid of photographs, and features only crude line drawings that are sometimes confusing, and sometimes completely undecipherable. ""Honey, what is that supposed to be, a knee?"" ""No, I think it's an elbow."" ""Ohh! It's a chin!""It's a shame that the poor presentation drags this book down into the two-star region. Let's hope they jazz it up a bit for the next edition -- if there is a next edition."
3,Great story/poor translation,"I just finished ""Strangers"" by Taichi Yamada. The narration is a bit sloppy and some of the translation seems stilted, with convoluted syntax, although that may reflect the original Japanese writing for all I know. It doesn't seem well-written especially considering the first person of the first-person narrative writes for Japanese television.But the theme dominated and was both moving and curious. The story captures, for me, the psychological security from being my parents' child and the joys of reunion. The last sentence sums up why I like the book: gratitude for the time my parents gave me."
4,psychological ghost story in the best japanese tradition,"yamada's strangers is a wodnerfulyl drawn out psychological story that makes one question our relationships, with our parents, our loved ones and who we deem as ""strangers"" in our life.the story isnt the scariest around, and despite its surprise ending nor is it the most shocking. however, the evenly tense plot that keeps the reader thinking but still on edge reveals the craft of the author.a thinking persons ghost story, but one that could have beena lot better with superior translation."
4,"Nicely written, gripping novel about death","Taichi Yamada takes us to the world of a Tv producer from Tokyo, who after a painful divorce gets in touch with his dead parents.Are they ghosts? were they ever dead? Everyone can relate to the character's predicaments since we all wished at some point of our lives to meet a dead loved one again. That is what makes this ghost story human and realistic to a certain extent.The main character however sees himself affected negatively by these ecounters, and he is in for a very big surprise.This book makes you think, but it's fast paced and very enjoyable at the same time."
5,Buy it,"Great stuff on this cd. The selection on this cd is top notch, too! Just listening to the ending theme, To Far Away Times and To Good Friends are simply awesome. Excellent excellent wide variety of music."
4,Very Nice Pans,Very Nice Quality Pans. I got these pans and have yet to use them. They are nice quality and I will be excited to use them with my christmas baking next year. They don't recommend dishwasher use which is a disappointment to me but other than that they appear great. Will work great for regular cookies and bars as well.
3,"Misleading Title, passable quality, but a good deal","This collection includes many movies available on budget sale DVDs, such as ""The Last Time I Saw Paris"", ""The Snows Of Kilamanjaro"", and ""The Jungle Book""; it also includes a few movies that are sold at more retail price, such as ""Anna Karenina"", ""Of Human Bondage"", and ""Little Men"". The rest of the material are 1950s teleplays or made-for-TV versions of literary classics: ""Huck Finn"", ""A Connecticut Yankee"", ""Legend Of The Sea Wolf"", ""Call Of The Wild"", etc. It's interesting to see some of the TV teleplays with their original commercials.This collection is definitely worth the discount price for which it is sold; but be aware that in order to get so many of these literary classics on two discs the quality is compromised. It is recommended for students of Western literature and of film/theatre, so that one can see how these great books were translated onto the big or small screen."
5,Great Cinema: 15 Classic Films (4 Disc Set)Elizabeth Taylor,"Bought this for Sean Connery starring in a very grainy Macbeth in his early years.This flick alone is worth the price. The four discs are a treasure trove of great film making from yesteryear.It is a bargain. Cyrano De Bergerac in there too with Ferrer, the best ever version."
4,Chock Full of Info!,"This book is one of the best I have read so far. The author lists lots of how to tips for all phases of the invention process. I, like another reviewer of this book, only wish the author had an e mail address so I could communicate with him. I really learned somethings that I could DO from this book. (some supposedly how-to books only tell how the author did it! ) This book helps to end some of the frustration that arises from having a great product--and not knowing where to go with it! Thanks"
4,Something to ponder!!!,"I found Mr. Reese's book to be very inspirational and a very easy read. A different approach and something I will try. What he teaches is that anybody can do this, and how to do it. There is so much negative out there and the odds of success seem slim. An extremely important thread runs through the book - Get your hands dirty and work hard until you get it done. Good advice! It worked for me. Though I have just read this book, I had already just licensed my first invention. If I had read this book first, it would have been very helpful, although it might have caused me to give up too early, due to some apparent ""fatal flaws""."
2,Not the best book on Cavaliers,I am getting a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and ordered a number of different books. I found this one to be the least helpful. In fact - at one point the author says that Cav nails are easy to trim because you can always see the quick with their light nails - but I believe other books have said that the darker Cavaliers have dark nails. That seems like a pretty big error. I would not recommend this Cavalier book.
2,The Guide to Owning a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel,"This book has a lot of nice photos but is otherwise pretty generic, except for the history of the breed. While looking this book over, I got the feeling that almost any breed could be substituted making it more of a general dog book to me. I much prefered ""Your Happy Healthy Pet Cavalier King Charles Spaniel by Norma Moffat. She is a breeder and exhibitor and you can tell, she really knows the breed. Her book is also a hard cover and a good value."
2,Cheap plastic.,"Got what I paid for on this one. The only thing that what good about this product is the size is great. The cover itself is very, very, very, thin. Tore the first week I had it and had to patch with black duct tape. The cold seems to even make it more brittle and tends to crack if not very careful with it. Have given up on it by now and am ordering a better replacement. Did I say it was thin."
3,Gift for Courtney,"My daughter thought it was a cute story. It was a birthday gift for her friend whose name is actually Courtney. However, there is some imagination required in this book--my daughter chose to think of the dog always being around and rescuing the kids in the end. The friend had a different perspective about the dog dying or being sent away and found it more depressing than my child did. I'd say it was a ""miss"" as we were looking for a book about someone of the same name as our friend. I've had better luck with books of other girl's names, a fun and unique approach to gift giving for young children."
3,Not Bad but Not Larry Kanuit Either,This book is very informative but is not as well written as Larry K's. I think if I'd read this one first I would have liked it more. All in All not a bad read though.
3,The individual books are better,I got this (and Kirsten's Story Collection) thinking it would be nice to have the six books in one volume for my daughter. After I got it I realized that five of the six historical lessons had been omitted from the collection. Since the historical lessons are part of the value of the books I was disappointed. I'll be selling both collections and buying the hardcover books individually.
5,lovetoread,I just gave this to my daughter as a birthday gift. You cannot go wrong with these books. They are all so good. It is great that all six are now bound in one hard cover.
4,A sequel to A SEVERE MERCY,"This book is a sequel to A SEVERE MERCY. It does not possess the writing unity of the first book, but is more like a collage or scrapbook. It will be interesting reading for all those who loved A SEVERE MERCY. I do not recommend reading UNDER THE MERCY, though, unless you have read A SEVERE MERCY first."
2,Not up to par,"If you are looking for a great and moving reading experience like you had with A Severe Mercy, don't look here.Reading his facsist remarks and his other published works was truly painful.It amazes me that someone who so movingly wrote of the severe mercy of his wife's death couldn't write anything else that was worthwhile.Take my word for it don't waste your time."
4,Fun but never used it!,"Its one of those weird gifts, you buy, and ends up never being used. Still, very funny, fits every type of head."
3,So-So Book,Catherine Bell's story was awesome!The other two stories had too many curse words. But good story line.The condition of the book was good.I won't buy anymore stories written by Donna Bell and Lynn Collum.
5,Intense and furitive life,"This book taught me that literary criticisim could be valuable, funny, and an art form but what I loved most about it is how well written it is on the sentence level. The other levels are important but what I love is to read beautiful sentences.Here's two quotes that I pulled out in five minutes.""Only in the margins of the present novel is Ballards's real strength allowed any play: the ability to invest abstract vistas with intense and furitive life.""""It is as if all the institutional weights and fetters, the gravity of of the large agencies and big concerns, are pressing in on Simon; and Augie, who has swung life on to his brother's parallel track (he even has a stern Magnus daughter to court), must suffer this pressure vicariously, fraternally but with utterly unwelcome clarity."""
5,Wisemen Classic,"This album has enough knowledge that you wouldn't have to go to summer school......It might be too much for an average WU-FAN, but it is a must have for all the diehard fans out there. Much like Bronze's 1st album, this album teachs valuable lessons. It is real hip-hop, not that water down, r&b bulls--t....Great lyrics and beats....and would GZA and Prodigual Son be on a fake album? I don't think so! If you like Killah Priest's albums, and Think Differently, you will like this album"
2,"Recycle your cans, not your questions","I originally purchased the Kaplan 2003 LSAT Prep Book to prepare for the test, but due to circumstances beyond my control I needed to push my test date back a year. I was completely disheartened to see the amount of questions which were recycled in the 2004 LSAT 180 book from the 2003 book I studied from previously. Basically they took at least 1/3 of the questions in this book from their previous publications and simply relabeled them ""difficult"" to go along with the title of the new book and expectations of the reader. While the format of the book is quite nice, each sub-type of question has its own section, this in no way makes up for the sheet Kaplan tries to pull over the readers eyes by labeling the questions ""tough""."
3,"Good questions, terrible explanations",I also used Nova's LSAT prep book. I loved it! The problems were explained in depth whereas with LSAT 180 you are left in the dark. LSAT 180 is good for practicing hard questions but if the book doesn't tell you how to work through them what good is it?
3,"A little odd, but convincing","There is no doubt that Kirshbaum knows what he wants to do with these suites. Whether or not you like his approach is a matter of taste. For me, there are more satisfying performances than this one.There are some odd mixtures of philosophy here. He uses a cello made in 1729, but tunes it using the 20th-century A=440 standard. And he uses far more ornamentation than I've heard in all my other recordings of these suites *combined* (I have 4). An on top of that, he fiddles around with the rhythm, using more rubato than almost any other performance I've heard.One definite negative (for nit-pickers like me) is how the performance is recorded. The miking is so close you can hear Kirschbaum breathing. Which wouldn't be so bad if he breathed normally, but in the quicker movements, he breathes quicker -- sometimes sounding like he's hyperventilating. I find it quite distracting at times.Not a bad performance or recording, but you could find better."
3,à essayer ...,"Belle sonorité, jeu discipliné mais rien de spécial.Kirshbaum est un bon violoncelliste dont le jeu laisse voirquelquefois des vrilles un peu bizarres.ex: 3e et 4e mouv. suite 1. À essayer ..."
4,NOT WITHOUT SCARS,"""Not Without Scars"" is a journey of inspiration. It reaffirms that lives can change for the better and that one's past does not have to hinder them forever. I plan to send copies of this book to two wayward young men soon to be released from prison. ""Not Without Scars"" will not only be of benefits to them but to all who take the time to read this book. I was moved by its content."
3,"Good, though not great","If you like Aoi Nanase's illustration, you can enjoy this book. That is alpha and omega. The whole story is only for supporting characters, and all characters are only for supporting the scenes. I am not speaking ill of this manga. They are supporting what they are intended to support very well. You can feel how attractive Aoi Nanase's illustrations. I do not mean this book is just a collection of pictures. Each pictures have attracting 'power' a mere picture cannot have.If you want a wonderful story itself, however, or you are not very interested in her artworks, you seems to be disappointed. Aoi Nanase is not a good storyteller. The story of this book is fit for only one volume.I would like to give 3.5 starts. This book seems to be better than other 3-star mangas, but is not good enough to get 4, though I like it very much."
1,baaad,i dont think it has realy subject and i didnt get the meaning of the story if it has a meaning
3,Organic and metallic,"Considering the limited arsenal this drum and violin duo deal in and despite much of that jamming repeating itself thematically, Hangedup's brief self-titled manages to dig deep. Anyone familiar with Constellation's releases of various GYBE side projects will feel right at home with the minimalist dread."
3,Pretty Handy--Good for Beginners,"This book wasn't exactly what I thought--I thought it was information on how to reduce your gear weight. It does have a bit on that, but mostly it contained information I already knew. It would, however, be excellent for someone starting out or for people that want to keep certain information at hand on a trip--after all, the book weighs (you guessed it)2 oz."
2,Pretty dull,"This book is a third sequel to a book of established writers' travel horror stories. Here, amateur writers share their travel woes. It is, clearly, an attempt to milk a cash cow. While the writing is adequate (certainly not great), it's the content of the stories that really makes this a useless anthology. They're the quality of story you might tell your friends at dinner, but are in no way deserving of publication. Examples include: I was on a plane that was delayed; I couldn't find my car after the Super Bowl; we rented a boat and wrecked it; the service at this restaurant in England was very slow; we went to a hotel and damned if it wasn't a fairly shabby hotel; we ate some food and got sick. There are a few stories as interesting as, say, getting hurt and experiencing Vietnam's standard of hospital care. But mostly this is very dull, and pretty close to worthless."
4,On the Edge of My Seat,"This is one of the best thrillers that I've seen in a while. I was on the edge of my seat during the entire second half of the movie. I liked the plot a lot. It's very different than other thrillers...Very original stuff. I don't think that I've ever seen a scientific thriller that has to deal with deaf patients. It definitely grabbed my attention during the first half when they start to conduct all the tests on each patient.It is always worse when people mess with the handicapped, since they are viewed as ""easy targets."" I think that is why it is so intense. I don't know. I really enjoyed this movie. It got my heart racing, which a movie hasn't done in a while."
5,A personal touch to an impersonal war,The book is both well written and entertaining. The reader will experience every emotion and gain a very keen understanding of one boy's tumble into manhood. Regardless of your views on the Vietnam war you'll love it. This book is not about the war but about a small piece of a young man's life!
5,New with a reservior,"Most master cylinders are sold only with the metal body. The car I worked on had been contaminated with some oil product. That makes it hard to clean out the reservoir and attach to the rebuilt master cylinder. This product is NEW with a NEW reservoir. Just bleed it and install it. As an ASE certified mechanic for over 20 years, Raybestos brand parts have seldom let me down. You will not find quality parts like this at AutoZone or similar places."
2,Good product but not for me,"I am giving this a rating of two stars because the product just didn't agree with my face. I liked the smell and the way it went on my skin but the lotion wasn't for me. Every time I would apply the lotion, I would break out. It's to bad because I like Murad products."
3,Murad Skin Perfecting Lotion,a good moisturizer but not much more than that.Did not affect the skin tone at all.I also had to apply a big amount of this product because the lotion is very light.
5,Seductive,"This is a seductive book. It starts with anecdotes that draw you in then leads you step-by-step to an indepth understanding of software vulnerabilities. This books is an essential introduction and enduring reference on a critical but often overlooked area of information security. In the business we spend most of our time and attention on perimeter protection and authentication, and way too little on the actual vulnerability of the stuff we buy and the code we develop. This books is a thorough and entertaining call to action and plan of attack. An absolute must buy."
4,Don't let the black hat on the cover fool you...,"This book is a great review of software security and deserves to be on any security professional's bookshelf. The chapter on Rootkits (Chapter 8) is well worth the price of the book. While the book isn't too long (at just over 400 pages) it does deliver in a concise, easy to read format that makes the book a rewarding read."
2,Good tune but a Great Song is on the way!,"This is a good song with an excellent production and some attractive mixes. However Kate Ryan has a truly fabulous song in the works called ""Desenchantee"". ...Kate Ryan is 20 years old and from Belgium. ""Scream for More"" is a good cd single to own if you want to possess the first single by a potentially hugely successful artist.There are six mixes on this cd: 1. Radio Edit 3:58 2. USA mix 7:50 3. Orphean Remix 6:14 4. D & A Remix 5:50 5.Club Dub 9:08 6. Original Extended mix 7:52. All the mixes are extremely inventive and attractive. Listen to the pretty synthesiser work on Club Dub. Many of the best and effective Trance techniques are showcased in these mixes.This cd single makes good driving music! Put it in your car player and hit random/shuffle. You've got 41 minutes of driving time!"
3,Scream for More,"Okay, before I actually do ""scream for more"", I want to make sure that I am getting the correct disc. Is this the single of Kate Ryan's Scream For More track or not? Some of the reviews indicate that it is but the title list says otherwise."
4,Good product at good value,"Product matches description, 100% shea butter, I believe it is free trade... I bought this as a gift for my mother and she is very pleased with the results. I use ""Got to Be Shea"" and other Bath and Body Works products that have a large amount of shea butter in the lotion, but its nice to have 100% shea butter which is very good for the skin in moderation."
3,Grainy but good,"Although this is not unrefined shea butter, it is still a good moisturizer. I used this to make my whipped shea butter mix. While it is very moisturizing, it is very grainy and gritty. Once applied I could see and feel some of the white grains that did not absorb. Overall, it's good but due to the graininess of the product, I will stick to unrefined shea butter."
2,Disappointing texture,"I love shea butter and switched to this brand from the more expensive Pre de Provence brand because this was cheaper. However, I'm disappointed in the grainy texture, and the product separates with a film of oil floating on the top. Maybe my product is defective??? I live in a very mild climate and my house temperature stays in the sixties to the eighties at times. The graininess is always there. The extra time it takes to keep the product in my hand or rub it on heels/elbows in order for the grains to melt, is not worth it. There's no way I can use it as a general skin moisturizer because of the graininess. Will be going back to the other brand as it's truly creamy."
4,Fell In Love,I normally get raw shea butter and patiently wait for it to melt down in my hands. No need with THIS! It's like whipped butter. I was very impressed. Worked great on my skin and in my hair.
5,soothes my babys eczema,"I wouldnt say that it heals my daughters eczema, but it definitely calms the itch and softens her skin. Most importantly it does not further irritate her skin. I use it all over her face and body as well as my own. Great moisturizer."
2,Shea Butter Lotion- wrong ingredients,"Shea Butter arrived in good time and is a very soothing lotion. However, the ingredients listed on the tube are not the same as listed on the Amazon page's Product Description and Important Info. Allantoin is a major ingredient in these 2 lists. However, the tube itself lists many different ingredients and--no Allantoin--making it a very different product. I ordered a Shea lotion containing Allantoin but got something very different, so I will give a 2 star for MISREPRESENTATION. Please get your lists right!!--Some people have allergies to some of these ingredients and need to trust the ingredient list that YOU provide!"
3,Good Product But Not Great,I read the reviews about this product and everybody had raved about it. I had expected this product to be out of the world. I have used this product for a week. It is a good product but not great.Pros1. Good moisturizer2. Makes skin look brighter the next day3. Does not clog pores4. Rub a little on your hands and it melts easily.Cons1. Greasy and does not absorb very quickly even if you apply very little.2. Sometimes it shows white grit after applying.3. The manufacturer does not list any ingredients on the container. Even though this claims to be 100% shea butter something must have been added to give it the smooth look which has not been listed.I probably will continue using it because shea butter is beneficial for the skin but only at night because it does not absorb very quickly.
1,worst shea butter EVER!,"I purchase this product from my local health food store because I wanted to find an alternative for convenience. Well this in my opinion is the Shea from Hell, literally. The grit which is a nice way of wording it. I felt as if I had played in a sand box. I rubbed my hands half to death and when I put it on my arms and legs my husband was questioning me if the shea had an expiration date on it. I even had him rubbing the product into my skin until it was red. Not now shea butter ever again. I even placed the shea butter in my microwave thinking it would melt. I tried the refrigerator thinking it would be better at melting once it was placed into my palm, that was a joke! It is currently in the bottom of my refrigerater until hell freezes over."
3,It's OK,I bought this lotion to test it out while my husband and I are trying to get pregnant so I'll have a good routine going when I actually am expanding. I didn't realize that there is only a fraction of the product that is Shea Butter. It is nice and thick but does leave a sort of filmy residue and I needed a large-ish amount to spread around my torso area. I like the smell and I guess the best I can say is that it's OK. I think I will keep looking for something that is better.
3,It's not for pain,"I've been using 100% Unrefined Grade A Shea Butter and miss took this product for the same healing properties. I expected this product to releave my aches and pains like the 100% UNREFINED does. I was so excited when I bought this, that I purchased 4 jars---well now I just use it as if I would any other lotion, but this would be my first option for Dry skin."
5,Great Basic Shea Butter,"I have bought some other She products, but I will be buying this Now She Butter again. Simple, basic product, been buying for years, don't think I will buy anything else from now on. Good product for super dry skin and winter weather. Great for under eye cream too."
4,hair or skin,"I purchased this shea butter for my hair, but I am actually using it more for my skin. It makes my skin feel moisturized and soft. Its not greasy at all. I plan on mixing it with a carrier oil, such as almond."
5,very nice,i have psoriasis so i wanted to purchase a deep moisturizer. I'm against using body lotions so Shea butter seemed like a good product to try. it doesn't moisturize my psoriasis as good as i thought it would but i do love using it on my feet and hands.
4,Sheap Better Lotion,"After the winter months on Artic fish beaches, I use the NOW Foods Shea Butter Lotion for the area of my nose that is prone to cracking, dryness and soreness due to the winter sun.It's pretty good stuff and close to being more natural than chemical.I typed all the Ingredients from my product:Ingredients: De-ionized Water, Shea Butter, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Juice*, Meadowfoam Seed Oil, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Vegetable Glycerin, Stearic Acid (vegetable source), Cetyl Alcohol/Cetearyl Glucoside, Glucose/Glucose Oxidase/Lactoperoxidase (natural preservative), Jojoba Oil, Vegetable Squalene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Rose Hip Seed Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Xanthan Gum, Phospholipids (from soy lecithin), Potassium Sorbate, Vitamin A (as Retinyl Palmitate), D-Panthenol, Grapefruit Oil, Lime Oil, Natural Vanilla Extract and Natural Orange-Grapefruit Citrus Essence.*Certified Organic"
1,Shea sand,"Well after being afraid to order the yellow Shea butter, I purchased this at a health food store. Sadly it is dry crumbly garbage. I melted it and whipped it... And it dried hard and grainy. When it melted on my skin it was greasy not smooth and silky."
2,Too Grainy,I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. This Shea butter is way too grainy! it takes forever to emulsify in order to remove the grains... It would be nice if I could get past this but I cannot.
4,Shea Butter,"I enjoyed this product. Unlike the Cocoa butter, I didn't have to soften it. It is hard, but soft enough to work with. I would buy this product again."
2,Grainy,This product is very grainy and sits on skin. I can understand shea butter being grainy sometimes but it takes a long time to melt on my skin (like other shea butter products that I've tried). Never again will I purchase shea butter unless there is a tester available. I've tried some that are wonderful. This one is far from it.
3,shea,I liked it OK. You have to melt it in the micro wave for it to be useful and I just don't seems like to much troulble trying to guess how much to do
2,"Way too gritty, low quality","I bought this upon reading all the glowing reviews, but I should've paid more attention to the prior review indicating the graininess of the butter. It honestly feels like you're rubbing your skin with sand. I have to take a dab between my hands first, then vigorously rub it until it melts and disintegrates the little sand grains before I can apply it to my skin, and even with all the rubbing, it still feels more like a scrub than a ""butter""."
3,Only if you are looking for a bargain on Refined shea butter,"I bought this product a our local health foods store and asked the clerk if this was refined or unrefined/raw. She did not know and those words were not on the jar- it only says ""natural"". I tried it anyway and compared it to AAA raw/unrefined shea butter which I've used before. They are two completely different products- as I found out after I did some internet research. This NOW product is extremely grainy and crumbly and very difficult to apply. I lost about half of it from the jar to my elbow :). Raw shea butter goes on smoother and retains much more of shea's healing and moisturizing properties. However, this NOW product is half the price of AAA shea butter so if you are looking for just a good deal on moisturizer, try this. If you are able to afford a bit more on a great moisturizer- look for unrefined/raw shea butter."
3,"Dude, where's my car?","As a 1977 Mach 1 owner I was also looking for more even coverage that included lower level Mustangs from across the years, they aren't just the stuff of fleet sales, they are Mustangs as well. I was also expecting more info on the Mustang II in such a definitive book. Maybe it would be better to get some of the smaller books that cover a narrower range of model years, like the MBI title ""Mustang 5.0 & 4.6 1979-98"", or one of the books on the 1964 1/2 - 73 cars."
2,A nice little fantasy trip,"This is a wonderful book to read if you want to imagine yourself living somewhere exotic in an uncluttered space with minimal (or no) possessions.It's all about design and I'm sure design mavens and architect-groupies will love it.I picked it up looking for ""good ideas"" (as advertised in the title) I could use in, or adapt for, my small condo. In my real life as a middle-class working person living in the US. I found none.Pretty pictures, though, of some inventive solutions to putting bed, bath, kitchen, and sitting facilities into small areas."
3,Sir Small and the Dragonfly,"I'm not crazy about this book, and decided to return it. The woman needs rescuing from the dragonfly, and ""The butcher said, ""I am too old."" The baker said, ""I am too fat."" The spatial relationships are a little off kilter, too. Sir Small's sword is the size of a pin, his shield is no bigger than a penny, but he rides an ant as his steed, and it is huge compared to him."
5,Great first grader reader,"My son loved reading this book in First grade. That says a lot, since reading was not his favorite thing to do. AR level 1.7A dragon fly carries away Lady Teena from the town of Pee Wee, will sir small and his trusty ant beable able to save the day?"
4,Check for availability when ordering!,"Although I am confident that this is a fine soundtrack, being a huge fan of the series, this CD may not in fact be available. Don't waste four months waiting for it like I did: make sure Amazon has it in stock before you order! Trust me, ignore the ""Ships within 4-6 weeks"", if that's what it says up there right now -- the supplier is out. Perhaps they don't even have access to any more of them! Caveat emptor."
1,Weirdly disappointing,"This book calls itself an ""urban historical"" and I can see why they didn't want to be specific about that and add a NOUN to this adjectival phrase. Is it a novel? Is it an account of Walker's life? Neither, it seems. It is a weird juxtaposition of fact and fiction--and you can't tell what's fact and what's fiction. No notes or anything. Give this one a pass--even if you want an impressionistic account of Harlem Renaissance life. You'd be much better off looking at photos."
1,Disappointed,I was extremely disappointed when I read this book. Rough Amusements: The True Story of A'Lelia Walker etc. should be retitled as the True Story of Jennie June. If you want to learn more about Jennie June and [alternative] culture in New York during the late 1880's to the 1930's read this book otherwise pick up a copy of The Black Rose a much better fictionalized account of the life of Madame C.J. Walker and her daugther A'Lelia.
2,not worth reading,"this book really isn't worth buying. I am student in web design and have used flash on occasion. If you have never used flash before I recommend this book but for everyone else it doesn't tell you anything you don't already know. It's a small book for a heafty price, it could actually be cut in half because they repeat everything 3 or 4 times."
5,ONE OF MY FAVORITES,"After watching several K-dramas, this is still in my top 3. I really love Kim Hyun Joong in this, and the female lead is cute and not annoying like some. It's a drawn-out love story, but well worth the wait. Great music and cute bears at the end of each episode add to its charm!"
1,Boring and cheesy,I've seen over 50 Korean Dramas and this is one of the worst. I've also seen the original Taiwanese version which is 20 times better than this. The actors have no chemistry and the filming is choppy and cheesy.
5,Smiles!,This show will make you laugh and smile throughout. Watched the entire show on Netflix and loved it so much that I wanted to buy and keep the memory. If you like K-Dramas like Rooftop Alley Cat then this is for you.
3,Great Drama..but terrible subtitles,"I loved this drama when I viewed it online and was delighted to find it here and with English subtitles. Alas, the person doing the subs should give employer a refund for the work done on this video collection. The translation is worse than that you would get from Google or Bing...most of it reads as if Yoda was speaking.""You friends noodles cold"" I will continue my search for a better copy of this show!"
1,Not impressed,"I was terribly disappointed in these. I use these for my Chihuahuas and usually purchase incontinence pads from Sams Club. These are SO thin, with SO LITTLE filling, they are almost worthless. Don't waste your money."
2,If you don't have Surround Sound: Do not buy this.,"I know this probably should go without saying, but this sounds AWFUL in stereo. Buyer beware, if you only have two speakers to listen to this on, just don't even bother.I have no idea if it's good in 5.1 Surround Sound, because I don't have that kind of set up. Kind of wish I did, just to see what this is all about because I can tell that they added all kinds of little flourishes that aren't there on the original release, like actual additional vocal tracks and guitar tracks and effects and things. But as it is, this not an enjoyable listening experience in Stereo, it has all kinds of compression and level issues. Oh well, I still have my trusty old CD copy."
4,Childhood Revisited!,"At one time I owned most of these Marvel Comics Video Library tapes. I have since lost most of them to my brother and nephew who ""can't find them anywhere."" Anyway this entry was very enjoyable because it contatined the only episode of of the short lived Spider-Woman cartoon that wasn't a complete failure. Even though the character on the cover of the box is nowhere in any of the shows on this tape it is still worth the watch. The 1967 Spider-Man cartoons at the end of the tape are also some of my favorites with Dr. Von Schlick and the Human Fly Twins.If you enjoy collecting these types of Marvel Comic memorabilia I would suggest picking these up as they are becoming rare. Being one of the ones that I lost I will be considering pikcing this up myself in the not too distant future so hurry."
3,Not for Sleeping,"I bought this hammock with the intention of using it as a bed replacement and I had to return it. It's width is more suited to be a porch swing, it just isn't wide enough to sleep in. Don't buy this for a bed!"
4,Book of Conquests,"The way the person whom recommended it to me went on about it, you would have thought the secrets of the universe where within those pages. lolIt was a good read however & I am going to give it to my son, I think he will enjoy it."
4,this was a good track,I dug this track a few years back.Wyclef is very hit&miss with me but here He showed growth&I enjoyed this song.
1,Don't buy it if you want the original French!,"This is the Alfred Publishing reprint of the Kalmus edition. Kalmus included the French text and a German translation, but Alfred removed both and substituted Italian and English only. Be warned!"
1,Annoying that this result came up when I was trying to browse movies,"The title says it all. This was the first of many movies that I found while browsing the prime eligible movie lists. Well, turns out it's just a 3 minute clip. I know that I'm supposed to review the actual product (ie, the 3 minute clip itself), but when it comes to streaming movies, part of the product is the overall user experience. Therefor, I give this the lowest possible rating."
4,HILARIOUS!!!,"I am not huge into comedies but this is definitely worth watching for a good laugh! This film was so funny. The main character's delivery was priceless. I liked the alter ego. I thought the film could have been more interesting -- I was secretly hoping that the girl ended up using him just to get to french school and that the main guy ended up with the crazy bernice chick. Not sure if it would've made a better a movie but I was hoping for a different ending. All in all, the movie is still one of the funniest I've seen!"
3,Poor Michael Cera. He's been typecast.,"He will forever play the role of the awkward teen-child, inhabiting an odd place between Seth Rogen and Adam Sandler. Still, this was definitely his best role yet, putting his awkward humor to use, along with allowing him to stretch his chops, as they say, in playing the comically bada$$ Francois Dillinger.Confession: I've read the novel the film is based on. The film is quite tame in comparision, considering that the book opens with two 14 year-olds fellating each. Michael Cera did not fellate anyone in the film. Though he should. Would help his career."
3,I still cannot make up my mind on how I feel about this movie.,"I will admit it is amusing at parts, and the conception is great. I have not read the novel it is based on, but I heard it was wonderful. After viewing this movie several times, I still cannot decide if it is good. I get a very hipster vibe from the movie, but it does have redeeming moments of comedy.I apologize-- this review will not help many. I just needed to voice the fact that this movie is hard to place in a category."
4,A near perfect comedy w/ heart! 4.5 stars!,"Based upon the novels by CD Payne, this film has a typical ""young man out to lose his virginity"" plot that so many teen comedies do. However, it's not a comedy for teens; it's for adults who like comedies, and it happens to be about teens. This film sets itself apart from typical teen-fare with its sharp dialogue and quirky characters. Michael Cera stars and brings his usual nerdy charm to the role yet this time his character has an underlying passionate, smooth talking badassness that shines through in a way that separates him from other similar roles. Some may be quick to pass this off as a ""hipster"" comedy, but they'd be missing the mark--there's no irony in Cera's protagonist. He's all heart and, much like this film, hilarious to watch."
4,Really funny if you like this type of humor,"This is a really funny movie. That said the humor is a little dry. If you are a fan of Michael Cera's somewhat serious comic delivery then you will enjoy Youth in Revolt. I'd say worth a rental, not a purchase."
1,abysmal. worst movie i've seen in 13.8 years.,"The trailer for this looked interesting, but this flick turned out to be the worst movie i've seen in a long time. atrocious. The flow was terrible and too many things happened that made me wondering what the hell was really going on. Dont waste your time. I NEVER turn off a movie once I start, but there were 4-5 times I kept asking why I was wasting my time and maybe it would get better. it gets worse with every last minute, descending into an abysmal pit of terrible film-making, especially yin the last 20 minutes of the movie."
3,3.5 Stars Pretty Good Movie but not as funny as I thought,This is 3.5 Stars. This movie is a good story and a good cast but not as funny as the previews made it out to be. I think with such a great cast it could have been way funnier.
2,Funny......but plot progression was horrible,"Obviously the movies will always deviate from the books. But my goodness, everything seemed rushed and a lot of important things were left out. The book obviously shows Nicks extreme obsession over Sheeni and I think that was missing from the film. The rebellious acts by Nick in the book build up a more believable story. So there is a bunch of elements and plot points missing before he moved with his dad and more missing after. So overall I think the attempt was ok...but the story never had a chance to build correctly and the will certaintly be no chance for a sequel. Still funny moments though.... Read the book...And one more thing. Nick was a master at getting out of situations and brushing past trouble.... I can't believe they had him arrested in the movie...I was sooo pissed!"
2,Awkward - not really funny,"I was expecting a lot of laughs. A lot of the scenes seemed forced, and the entire relationship with the girl didn't feel real at all. My wife and I both rolled our eyes at the end of the movie."
1,Another Pre-Teen Masquerading as Teen Movie,"What happens when adults never grow up and are still stuck in and reliving their teen fantasies? They become screenplay writers because that's the only skill they have that makes money off of their children. The value of predictability is that it's, well, comfortably predictable. And, so you'll find all the cliches and stereotypes of school, summer vacation, parents, cops, cars and, oh, sex. The actors were, however, well typecast for their roles because that's all we ever seen them do in their acting careers.Viewers that find ""Youth in Revolt"" rebellious entertainment will really get hot for ""Hot Tub Time Machine""."
3,becoming a male,"A fun-story of hypocrisy and teen rebellion as a major character heads towards his male role encouraged by a sixteen-year-old suppressed by her religious parents, is on a landscape of a widely-present isolation, sexism and petty protectionism while younger generation of Americans looking forward to being different from ascendants merely finished in predecessors' footsteps.Is it in the States only, however???"
1,Three minute clip.,"This movie is listed as a Prime Instant movie, but it is only a three minute clip. This is the first title that I have found that does that. I found it misleading and aggravating. Show the entire movie or don't list it at all."
3,passable,"after having the krzr for about two weeks, the first drop gave my phone a nice crack across the entire glass face of the phone. after this i decided to get a case, and after looking around, this was the cheapest i could find (i mean the shipping was more than the actual product).I was really disappointed with this case though, it didn't fit flush with the phone (all the holes were not matching up as they should on a silicone case), didn't allow it to close completely, interferes with the camera, and just made the sexy & sleek phone look dull.I guess overall it does the job it is supposed to, but I was looking for something that would keep my phone looking good while keeping it fully functional and protected. I currently do not use the case, have not found anything that is really meeting the needs so I am just trying to be more careful with the phone."
4,It does the job for me,"This does the job to protect my phone. It is not for the fashion conscious but it prevents scratches if you keep your phone in your pocket like I do. The silicone has a nice feel, the phone is easy to grasp. The camera works fine with the cover but some of the buttons on the side are covered by silicone. However you can still use the buttons by pushing on the silicone. I think this cover will last 3-6 months; I will order more than one next time-but I would definitely order again."
4,Lube adapter,This kit works nice to get into the various spots that they put the grease zerks in. Makes the hard to reach spots easier.
4,Good book!,"Well, timing is everything... and isn't always fair. Had I not just completed reading The Hardness Factor before picking up ""Coping With Erectile Dysfunction,"" I would probably have given this book 5 stars.Metz and McCarthy have done a very good job of showing us the causes of erectile dysfunction along with some fixes (mainly using sexual awareness to overcome the problem).I've been using the methods in this book, The Hardness Factor, and Exercising the Penis to build up the strength of my erections. All books have contributed to me overcoming the problem. This book, however, is best from the psychological stand point. If you suffer at all in this area, I suggest getting it."
3,Standpoints,this book is more from a psychological standpoint of a man. if your looking for something to help you understand premature ejaculation or impotency from a mans point of view its a good book. If your looking at it as a spouse looking for answers then it's a fair book but really doesn't offer the proper solutions.
3,I hope this becomes popular,"I've read some of the manga series this is based off of and so far I really like it. Hopefully, this is a good anime, however I have heard that this is not as good as the manga. Flame of Recca is very similar to Yu Yu Hakusho, centering around a young high-school student who is capable of creating fire from his arm. It lifts many aspects from Yu Yu Hakusho, so if you like Yu Yu Hakusho, you'll probably like this, though maybe not as much."
5,"Works great, worth the money","My car isn't very powerful so I don't know that I can say I noticed a performance improvement, but I think it's worth the little bit of extra money to buy a reusable air filter."
2,Oh No!! They pulled a Metallica!,"Killing is my Business throught Countdown to Extinction were great albums. Even Youthanasia and Cryptic Writings had their great moments.But Risk?? What happened? They went way too commercial with this album.I'm a Megadeth fan, but sorry Dave. I hope you were right when you stated you had confrontations with the record labels and the band memebers because this album definately was a drop off from the past albums."
4,Wanderlust,"I give this album 4 stars for these excellent songs: Insomnia, Prince of Darkness, Time: The End. One of Megadeth's best songs, Wanderlust, is easily worth the price of the album.The rest of the songs? Not so great. But, that's why we have playlists..."
2,Megadeth - This may be a risk to your wallet,"Pros: Prince of Darkness, ray of light. :)Cons: Everything else, just about.It seems everyone is changing their sound to fit it. Metal pioneers Megadeth led by Dave Mustaine, for years had been trying something different, and now they have gone to the mainstream. Their latest release ""Risk"" adds electronic/industrial elements which seems to be the way all metal acts are going, and it is more than a little disappointing. There is one ray of hope on this album, ""Prince of Darkness"" relives the 80's metal glory days, and is a great song. But the other main release from the disc ""Insomnia"" gives me insomnia wondering how such a song could be made by metal gods like Megadeth. Oh well, all good things must come to an end, and Megadeths has been a ling time coming. Try to get your hands on ""Prince of Darkness"" though, it's 6 minutes of metal goodness.NOTE: This review was written Oct 12 '99"
1,"File under Trash, not Thrash","Worst Megadeth album. End of story. Don't waste your money. Get the remastered MD.45-The Craving(with Dave on vocals!) instead. I bought Risk when it first came out and I wanted to cry. If this was the direction they were headed, I would see what Metallica was doing at that time then. Luckily, they got over that creative goof and started putting out the slammin' music again. If you are new to the band, here is your mission:Peace Sells, But Who's BuyingRust in PeaceCryptic WritingsThe World Needs a HeroKilling is my Business and Business is GoodBuy these first and listen to them until they are worn out. Then:The System has FailedYouthanasiaCountdown to ExtinctionAnd:So Far, So Good, So WhatThis last one was when they were all pretty blasted on drugs and basically made the record to support the habit. It shows in the music and the new drummer and guitarist are lousy.Avoid Risk at all costs. Even if it's offered to you for free or given to you by Aunt Fanny at Christmas."
2,Meh,"Not too good, but no Megadeth album deserves 1 star.You people can say they pulled a Metallica all you want, fact is Load & ReLoad aren't nearly as bad Risk is. Listen to Bleeding Me, Fuel, The Outlaw Torn, Devil's Dance, etc. This album is mediocre at best. It makes a nice coaster though. Songs I find listenable at times. Crush Em, Wanderlust, Time:The Beginning, Ecstasy, and Insomnia. Over produced lame pop rock. 2.5/5"
4,Good But Diffrent,"Most Megadeth fans didnt really seem to like this album when it first came out. I thought it was decent/kinda liked it but was suprised at the new style and change they made to their sound. After listening to it all these years i love it. The songs are catchy though the lyrics arent as serious on some of the songs like prince of darkness or the doctor is calling- which are my 2 least favorites,. but the rest of the songs are really great with good beats/lyrics/guitar. Megadeth cant seem to make a bad album. Best songs on the album are crush em, breadline, Ill be there, Wanderlust (one of my favorites) insomnia and time. I would recomend this album to any Megadeth fan if you have an open mind and can appreciate a diffrent and unique sound from the band."
2,Risk Remastered,"This is a change of pace. Wouldn't want every album like this. Gotta love MegaDave. I don't know if any of these songs hit the airwaves. Breadline, Crush em and I'll Be There, certainly could be good candidates for radio play. This is not Metal. Hard Rock? Pop Rock I guess. Unique album non the less. Kinda tough to describe what it sounds like, that's why there's You Tube. Mild techno, blues, electric, synthesizer, industrial, mainstream. Can't really recommend buying, but if you're a Megadeth fan you might be interested."
5,"Not typical Megadeth, but I still love it!","This disc RISK has obviously been thoroughly reviewed and debated and I have to say I wasn't thrilled with this divergence at first listen, but once I understood it better and really LISTENED to what Dave was doing I fell in love with this one too. My favorite 'DETH disc is Rust in Peace - and for a very good reason. It just kills! So I know what Megadeth is. I wasn't fooled or offended by this one.If Dave was just showing that he could out-do Metallica at everything, INCLUDING making a more impressive, more interesting attempt at being radio-friendly (for lack of better words) then he achieved it. I didn't think for a moment that this was the beginning of an entirely new musical direction for Megadeth, especially taking into consideration the title. Not scared. Not offended. Dave rocks - that's all there is to it.He proved that Megadeth would have been a far better, more original ""sell-out"" than Metallica if they chose to go that route."
2,A Black Risk,"This was obviously Dave's attempt at making his equivalent to Metallica's Black Album (although Mr. Mustaine blames the producer.) The logo change (which is not seen on remaster) even resembles the Metallica logo from ""Load.""Oh well, it didn't work. I guess it was worth the RISK!"
5,A little-known classic,"Please ignore ""DMX from Da Hood."" It is obvious from his grammatical error (it should be ""worst"" book, not ""worse"" book) that he does not appreciate a wonderfully moving tale of a dark period in American history. ""The Man Without A Country"" is a quick read but one that will stay with you for a long time. Highly recommended."
1,awful,I'm an avid reader of romance novels and this is probably one of the worst written books I have read. I can't even give it a one star. I've read Sweet Fierce Fires by Myrus and rated it Very Good but I don't know if I would ever pick up another novel by her. Thank goodness I keep a print out of all the books I read.
4,Memories,"I bought this as an impulse purchase when I was feeling nostalgic of music from my childhood. YMCA is a forever favorite at skate rinks and weddings, but I wanted my kids to hear other VP songs."
3,Looks good as long as no one touches it,"This cover overall looks alright, but it has a tendancy to slip off the chair and the material tends to attract dust and fur. So, if you have a pet beware. Overall though, for the price it's not bad and as long as you don't mind readjusting the cover after you use the chair then you should be good."
5,A thourough denouncement of Stalinism,"Vladimir Lenin, perhaps the most important historical figure in the twentieth century, not only fought against the tyranny of the capitalist class, but he also tried to fight against the growing bureaucratism in the Soviet Union that eventually led to Stalin's takeover of power. We see here his fight to spread the revolution and make it a truly a world revolution, not confined to a backwards country in Europe. He wanted to free mankind from subservience to a ruling class. The new biography of Lenin, written by a former Stalinist-turned-capitalist, is completely rebuked here. The biographer Volkoganov is a typical bourgeous seeking to denounce anything that smacks of true revolution and is quick to make friends with his new masters by writing his attack on Lenin. I suggest that anyone truly interested in Lenin read Lenin's works, and for a biography, read Trotsky's book on Lenin."
2,Definitely not leather,"This journal is a big disappointment. The design on the paper cover imitates a design that would've been used on leather...but dont assume this is actually a leather journal like I did. The design on the journal is ""old leather"" but it's not actually a leather bound journal. It's a very small journal with wide spaced lines in it that might be great to carry around in a purse for quick notes or something. The journal is soo small that it is for short time use. There are much better journals out there."
5,Another great one from Putumayo,"I got this one for Christmas, and had never heard it until I unwrapped it and loaded it onto my PC and iPod. But of course Putumayo didn't disappoint me -- do they ever? This is yet another terrific compilation of music, presented by the masters of such compilations.I can't even pick out one song that I'm iffy on, or don't like. They are all terrific, all different, all wonderful. I will be looking for more music by many of these terrific women."
4,Nice mix,This CD is a great mix of music from different countries. It serves as good background music!
3,peaceful and relaxing,CD is peaceful and relaxing...I play it at naptime in my classroom!Kids relax and I can get work done.
2,A big drop from earlier work,"A huge letdown for this Mark Wills' fan. I really liked 'Wish You Were Here' and 'Permanently' (a little less so), but this album could be a career ender. Overly polished production and weak writing on most tracks."
1,This album stinks,"I admit, I have seen Mark Wills in concert, I have his two previous albums, but this is one that I would like to use as a coaster. I liked the title track ""Loving Every Minute"" but thats about all I liked on this album. Very Weak, I recommend that you don't buy it unless you are a serious mark wills groupie and can't get enough of him. I was hating every minute of the rest of this album and Im waiting for the next one to come out. Perhaps a Christmas album? It has to get better than this."
2,Not Quite Emerging...,"From a die harrd PK fan. Buyer beware - Gentle Eyes isn't there!A conspicuous, unfortunate omission.Puzzling how publishers change, edit, and omit tracks ... but don't tell you!"
2,Bad sound quality,"The songs on this CD are great: ""007,"" ""Israelites,"" ""It Mek."" What more could you want from a Desmond Dekker collection? Well, the only thing missing is Rialto Records' attentiveness to the mix. The sound quality is all over the map. Everyone knows that ""007"" and ""Israelites"" are out there on other CDs with pristine sound, so there's no excuse for this CD's representing them as if they were recorded in a trash can. You wonder why ""Shing a Ling"" and ""It Mek"" sound fine while ""Israelites"" sounds dirty. So many reggae reissues share this nasty habit: uneven sound."
4,2 entertaining comedies,"No, this is not a direct spoof of van helsing with hugh jackman.This is actually a remake of seduction cinemas late 90's film Vampire Seduction. Both films are featured on the dvd so nobody is left out of the loop. Both films have their own charms. The remake has lovely Erika Smith playing a sexually confused nerd, who is visited by her dead uncle to kill countess dracula. The production value is low budget but still decent enough to watch.The original has John P. fedele in the van helsing roll acting as a total goofball.His performance is the saving grace of the film. The no budget production hinders the film, but still gives it a sense of astheitic identity.There's also some cool features like behind the scenes documentary, deleted scenes, and commentary from EI president Michael Raso which at some times sounds like a confessional."
2,the movie didn't live up to the name,"I got it expecting better sex senes than the women hugging and killing.Don't get me wrong, the whole movie is based on the idea that this desendant of a vampire slayer is a lesbian. that was interesting. The other women in the movie were Ok; I mean they are average pretty women that you'd see at the grocery store, but they are lezbians.This has the makings of a good movie, but the women never do anything with each other besides kiss, and rub their breasts, legs, and stmacs.The movie laft me feeling like I got ripped off, but maybe you'll think better about the movie than I did."
1,good servic bad movie,good servic bad movie.This wasthe worst VAmp.movie i have ever seen.There was know plot or very little of one .The ending was the chessest i have ever seen .The pun is intended .The company was great to deal with .The product came quikey.
1,Much less than expected,Enticed by its title while looking for a book I could use as a quick lookup reference for T-SQL commands/functions I bought this book among a bunch of other T-SQL books and was thoroughly disappointed by its poor organistaion (commands and functions are listed in some obscure groupings instead of alphabetically) and its even poorer print quality (some pages and images are so blurred that they are barely readable). Out of the several other books I bought this one ranks dead last.
4,This is a Good Harlequin Movie!,"As someone who likes to read romance books I was very interested when I heard that several Harlequin romance books were turned into TV movies and though I didn't get to see the movie Treacherous Beauties in it's original TV debut I did watch it when it was rerun on the cable channel WE and though it may not be as good as the book it is still pretty good and I liked the cast, especially Emma Samms and Bruce Greenwood and I also enjoyed the mystery and suspense of the story and I would highly recommend this DVD to any fan of romance movies and to fans of the book in which this movie is based on! BTW: The reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that some of the acting by the supporting actors was a little bland and stiff but at least the acting by Emma Samms and Bruce Greenwood was good so that definitely makes up for it."
3,Harlequin movie,"This wasn't my favorite. Bruce Greenwood and Emma Samms are actors I like very much, but the screenplay wasn't done as well as it could've been. It was melodramatic, in that 80's style. I liked the book better."
5,It's About Time,"This is Archie and the Drells' first two albums in their entirety plus bonus cuts. If you are interested in Archie and the Drells then buy this CD and skip the Greatest Hits CD on Rhino.The linear notes are fantastic, most of them in Archie's own words. When Tighten Up reached #1 in the Spring of 1968 Archie was in a German hospital recovering from injuries suffered in Viet Nam. Lots of great stuff."
3,A Marginally Entertaining Tale,"I have had Jeff Abbott on my list of authors to read for some while. While this book did not overly impress me, I can see where Whit Mosley would be a much more entertaining character given another setting.The book centers around Mosley, a Justice of the Peace in a small Texas town. Mosley's father is on his death bed and Whit sets out to find his mother who left the family thirty years previous. What he finds is a mother who has re-invented herself as an accountant for a mob family. Whit finds himself involved in a plot that includes murder, deception and vengeance.While certainly readable, this book did not engross me as I had hoped it would, but it kept me interested enough to persuade me to give this author another try."
2,Practical value: it has some recipes...,"This is an easy-to-read murder mystery set in Princeton, NJ. A Tallahasse journalist, having won the Pulitzer Prize, is invited to be a guest lecturer at Princeton University for a semester. Almost as soon as she gets there, three professors in the English department are murdered.This book will mainly be attractive to people who have spent some time in Princeton. It's fun to read about all the local Princeton establishments as the setting through which the plot unfolds. But the plot itself is pretty boring and predictable, and the villain is unconvincing. It also is weird how much time Waldron spends on describing the food being prepared for each meal. There are even recipes in the back. I feel less masculine for having read this."
4,tokyo's underworld,"if u like fallen angels by won kar wai...you probably might like this one...i found out about this movie 2 years ago when i was reading a media japanese magazine..it mentioned that the movie tells the experience of foreigners making a living in tokyo...however the movie is not just all about that, it tells story about infringe individual living in tokyo which is cool..we have the crip gangster, the junky wife, a blind old women, and the cool ragged guy whos planning to go back to kyoto. The shot of the movie is crisp and clear showing the city of tokyo. I enjoy seeing the movie showing troubled people living in the big city. the movie was made in 1997 and it seems that the movie have not gotten old with its style and subtleness Go watch the film if u want to see the dark side of tokyo...highly recommended for people who like fallen angels.."
3,The last Street I will ever read,"This is the third Streeter novel -- and happened to be the first I picked up. Unless something strange happens -- a rift in space and time perhaps -- I won't be reading any more of these. Portrayed by the marketing material as tough-guy, noir fiction akin to Chandler's Marlowe or Child's Reacher, Streeter is not even in the same league as those characters.We wait until page 146 to get any kind of action involving the protagonist. The pacing is deadly slow and the storyline (not lines... just line) hits lull after lull. You'll know who the bad guy is within, oh, 50 pages or so.The sad thing is that Stone has writing ability. He isn't a bad technician. And once in a while Streeter even cracks wise, like the great characters often do. Problem is, the humor and sarcastic comments are few and far between. Combine that fact with a story-line that isn't even remotely engaging... well, you pretty much get the last Streeter I will ever read."
5,Exactly what I needed!!!,"This book is a fine reference to computer scientists who wish to understand the protection and restoration background of different networking techniques such as SONET-SDH, IP and MPLS. This book is also a unique exemplar in the field of network recovery which strengthens its position further. It is well written and easy understandable.I found a very good introduction in each chapter in the book. Each theoretical section is followed by examples that makes the subject more understandable.I highly recommend this book."
3,Only ONE negative complaint but worth mentioning,"I ditto everyone else as far as the multi purpose way you can use it. I couldn't wait to get all these colors. And they are beautiful....HOWEVER.... Several of the BEST colors look as though they were already used. The jars were less then half full. A couple of the jars seals were not even attached. Not sure if I received someone's return, but that is the impression.I would return them however before I even opened any of them I wrote on the lid the number and color.I am curious if those are acceptable amounts in like the duo colors."
4,So Many Uses for Pearl Ex,"Length:: 4:13 MinsThis video shows how to make beautiful images using a rubber stamp, watermark ink and Pearl Ex powders. There are so many uses for Pearl Ex. If anyone is unfamiliar with this product, you owe it to yourself to check it out. You can use it in rubber stamping, as I show in the video, or you can use it in a multitude of other ways -- mix it with almost any medium then use it in bead making, in molded shapes with UTEE, for coloring Polymer clay shapes, pottery, clay, and many more. Pearl Ex pigments are pure color -- bright, clear and stunningly beautiful. I am trying to think of a negative aspect, but really, I can not. It is worth mentioning perhaps that Pearl Ex, being pure mica powder, has no ""sticking agent"" meaning it will not stick to your projects unless you have first mixed it with another medium."
5,Awesome!,"I love this stuff and was excited to see so many at such a great price. This stuff is excellent for many crafts, when you receive this product you will not want to put it down, ENJOY~Alicia~ Missouri"
2,Pretty bad,This is the one WWE DVD that I must say is pretty bad. I have watched neary 200 WWE DVD's and VHS releases. This one is pretty weak.The new Collection I hope delivers what this one was seriously lacking.
1,Giant letdown,"Just to give everyone a warning: this dvd has awful matches on it. I don't know why WWE re-released it. They should have taken the time to make a great I.C. Title DVD, and not put out this piece of trash featuring 4 of Shawn Michaels' worst matches and Bret Hart vs. Skinner. Yes, you heard right. Go pick up the Andre DVD that has 10 matches from early on in his career and the new RVD DVD. Leave this one behind, believe me,....I'm as big of a fan as it gets.-L.H. (CT)"
2,missing alot of great matches,"This is not even worth the money don't waste your time. They wasmatches they didn't included. How can you have the best of the IC title and not include Randy Macho Man Savage vs Ricky The Dragon Steamboat at Wrestlemania 3.They also could of included Austin vs Rock,Ulimate Warrior vs Rick Rude,Greg Valentine vs Tito Santana and many other match."
2,Missing some grounbreaking matches,"What was the deal releasing this DVD when it was missing some of the most monumental IC title matches in history (biggest standout: Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramon from WMX in the first ladder match) w/o a doubt the most remembered and greatest IC title match ever, possibly some politics behind it but hey if your're not gonna do it right then dont do it at all. Very dissapointed in this release. Dont waste your money on this"
4,Short but sweet.,"Few matches deliver power, prestige, and pure adrenalin like the battles for the Intercontinental Championship.The title is as highly sought after now as it was when Pat Patterson, the first title-holder, earned the title in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1979.In this collection, five classic IC matches from 1992-1993 burst to life, featuring incredible action from Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart,Mr. Perfect, and more...Shawn Michaels Vs Crush ( Sheffield, England - 11/04/1993Bret Hart Vs Skinner ( Prime Time Wrestling - 24/08/1992)Shawn Michaels vs Marty Jannetty ( Raw 19/07/1993)Shawn Michaels vs Mr Perfect ( Summerslam 30/08/1993)Shawn Michaels vs ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan ( Raw 03/05/1993)"
2,The worst of the damn I.C Championship!,The Best of the I.C championship is;Bret Hart vs Mr Perfect at SummerSlam 91Shawn Michaels vs Marty Jannetty at the Royal Rumble 93.Shawn vs Razor Ramon in an ladder match at Summerslam 95.Owen Hart vs Stone Cold at SummerSlam 97 and Survivor Series 97.Triple H vs The Rock at Fully Loaded 98 in an 2/3 falls.Chris Jericho vs Chris Benoit in an Ultimate submission at Judgement Day 00.Jeff Hardy vs Triple H on Smackdown in April of 2001.Edge vs Christian at No Mercy 2001 in an ladder match.Triple H vs Kane at No Mercy 2002.(I.C title is held vacant until May of 03).
2,"The ""Best of Intercontinental Championship"" ?!",Your wrong WWE. In fact this are the worst IC matches. They should have matches likeRoddy Piper vs. Bret Hart at WrestleMaina 8Bret Hart vs. The British Bulldog at SummerSlam 1993Shawn Micheals vs. Razor Ramon (Scott Hall) at WrestleMaina 10Rocky Malvia vs. HHH at SummerSlamKurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho WM16Val Venis vs. Rikishi in a Cage at Fully Loaded.Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit at Royal Rumble 2001Jeff Hardy vs. HHH on Smackdown 2001.HHH vs. Kane at Judgement Day 2001Edge vs. Christain at No MercyEddie Gurreuo (Spelled it Wrong) vs. RVD on RAWChris Benoit vs. RVD at SummerSlam.IC Battle Royal at Judgement Day 2003Christian vs. RVD on RAWCactus Jack vs. Randy Orton at Backlash 2004Randy Orton vs. Edge at Vengence 2004Shelton Benjamin vs. Christain at Survivor Series 2004Shelton Benjamin vs. Chris Jericho at Backlash 2005.Note: Most of this matches are my FAV. IC title matches.
1,Boring!!!!!!!!,"This Dvd should be called the best Intercontinental Shawn Michaels fights of 1993.You see 5 OLD matches from 1993 in which Shawn is in 4 of them.And the matches are not so good, usually he gets counted out or disqualified in order to maintain the belt.I think you should not buy this, just rent it somewhere."
2,WWE stop being so damn lazy!,"WWE, for things like Undertaker, Wrestlemania, and now, the Intercontental championship, you could have made great DVDs that would have all been great but instead u just find theese old crappy vhs tapes and re-release them on DVD. You could have made something great here but ur too damn lazy."
2,The Best?,The Only good match on the DVD is the HBK-Marty Jannetty match from 1993. The rest stink. this was just a mindless filler dvd. My advice: Go buy The History of the Intercontinental Championship 3 disc set. I give this DVD a 2 out of 10.
5,Did NOT get a rosette - but who cares?,"At least not in the 2003-2004 edition of the Penguin guide. The Lin / LAPO / Salonen cd did.But this and the Vengerov/Rostropovich, the Chung/Previn, the Shaham/Previn and the Mintz/Abbado all seem to be neck and neck - depending on who is listening. The Ricci/Ansermet gets high praise, too.I have this album and like it very much. Might as well be a rosette in my book."
5,Great resource for moms- new or seasoned,This book is a gift to mother's in that it gives permisssion and ways to nurture yourself while nuturing your family - something that many mothers never do. I loved the range of new ideas and have used many of them to great benefit. Highly recommend!!
5,Libras Need Balance,"I heard Beth speak at a Mother's Club meeting in California and thoroughly enjoyed what she had to say. Beth loves being a mother and it shows. She was very inspiring. Restoring Balance allows me to return to her important message: ""Thrive, don't just survive""and ""Sacrifice without sacrificing yourself."" In this book she offers creative ways to incorporate self-care into a mother's busy schedule."
3,"great soundtrack, but lacking satisfaction","Vampire Princess Miyu is a great show. It has great music too. The music is more background music...to maybe set a mood? but it's not the kind of music you'd listen to with friends. You'd listen to it by yourself. Like the show, the music is depressing. It wouldn't be party music. It has all the vocal songs from the show (which are all in Japanese). If you're the type of person who likes their music loud, this CD isn't for you. If you're the kind of person who likes mellow music to listen to by yourself, this CD may be for you. It's for you to decide.The price on Amazon for this item at the moment is around $70.00, is the music from that show really worth that much? in my opinion, it's not because i rarely even play the music on this CD."
5,EXCELLENT,Makes my hair feel super thick. Use once a week at the most. Or right before dying hair. Don't wash out.
4,Don't want to color my hair without this,I love this product it is a fantastic way to ensure your hair color takes evenly. I couldn't use it recently when I colored my hair and I can tell the difference! Dark ends and light roots ugh. I will not color without this again. Arrives in a timely fashion with tape over the lid to help keep it from leaking in transit.
2,Not so great for over processed and damaged hair,"I have natural dark brown thick hair, and have dyed it red with two chunks that I have bleached to a platinum level 9 blonde. The red when I do my roots always gets in the rinse and turns the platinum pink so I'm always re-bleaching. Obviously I have some very damaged hair in these areas. I decided I needed to get them red to alleviate further damage but they won't hold color. This product was supposed to be a miracle but I tried putting on hair first and mixing with color, neither worked the blond spots only came out a slightly darker pink.In the end I used a temporary semi followed by a veggi temporary dye and the pieces are mostly a solid red now. This product probably works great for normal or only moderately damaged hair but it didn't work for mine, which had been all but melted off with bleach.I've been coloring for 10 years now."
2,"GREAT company, pump not so hot.","When I got this pump, I had been borrowing my sister's 7-year-old Medela Pump-in-Style. With her's, I would be able to get up to 11 oz in 30 minutes, and only got 3-4 oz in over an hour with this pump. I thought that maybe it was just because of the difference in the suction styles and that it would change, but after 10 or more days, there was still no change in the amount I was able to pump. I gave up and contacted Dr. Brown's about the issue. They told me that they would repair or replace the item, at my choice. They are sending me a brand new pump to return for my refund (minus a restocking fee from AJ Wholesale---boo!), and allowing me to keep the one I already have to regift to someone or to sell second-hand. I couldn't believe how great their customer service is! As for pumping, I have gone to the Medela Freestyle, which is worth every penny!"
3,Slow but gentle,"If you're looking for gentle more than productive, this is your pump!Easy to clean and easy to use.I would recommend it if you pump occasionnaly and have time to do it.If you need it done fast and often, I would recommend a different pump"
1,dr.browns breastpump is not good,This breastpump does not work well. It does not have a good suction. I have a handpump as well and that one works MUCH better. I would advise not to purchase this pump.
2,Very Disappointed!,"I love the Dr. Brown bottles and the Dr. Brown freezer storage bags, so I thought this was a great pump before I got it. First of all it pinches the nipples and really hurts. Second It only lasted 1 week before it broke. I don't recommend it at all, and I hope the makers improve it."
1,Horrible!,"I have read the other reviews and wonder if mine is defective.. This pump was horrible . I expected a lot better because I own the Whittlestone double pump, which I love!!! and this is made by Whittlestone, so I expected so much better. Yet I Barely got any milk, not even a full ounce. It was painful and the massaing action was stiff. I soaked it in hot water and that still didn't help. I have nursed 4 children and use my pumps about 6 times a day, sometimes more, because I work 12 hour shifts.I would never buy this one again."
4,Classic Pesci,"So many people do not know about this movie, and it won't win any Oscars, but it is an overall descent movie that I recommend seeing."
4,A VERY UNDERRATED COMEDY,ALL THE NEGATIVE THINGS THAT A LOT OF CRITICS SAID ABOUT THIS MOVIE AREN'T TRUE AT ALL. I FOUND THIS MOVIE TO BE VERY FUNNY AND VERY ENTERTAINING. A SLUM OWNER [JOE PESCI] IS ORDERED BY A JUDGE TO SPEND TIME IN ONE OF HIS BUILDINGS. AND HE HAS DIFFICULTY ADJUSTING TO HIS NEW RAT-INFESTED SURROUNDINGS. JOE PESCI DOES GOOD AS ALWAYS IN THIS MOVIE. HAS PLENTY OF FUNNY MOMENTS. GET THIS MOVIE NOW!!
4,A GREAT HARD TO FIND COMBO!,"""THE SUPER"" IS ONE OF JOE PESCI'S FIRST MOVIES I HAD EVER SEEN HIM IN AND IS VERY FUNNY, BUT ALSO TELLS A TALE OF HUMANITY, DIGNITY AND A TASTE OF REALITY FOR HIM. ""WITH HONORS"" IS ONE OF HIS BEST FILMS IN MY OPINION SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE TYPE OF PERSON HE PORTRAYS AND HIS WISDOM HE INSPIRES IN THE PEOPLE HE MEETS."
3,Very Funny movie...,"This movie is FUNNY! The hilight of the movie is when Joe P was upstair and he heard music, (the fun) that was happening downstairs. He wants to join the party...then they all do the electic slide,(I think that was the dance, lol) Very funny!When I think of this movie,...this is the scene that I think of!I love the fact that his heart just softens towards the end of the movie for these tenent's & they become friends!On top of being funny,...this movie also tells a message!Liked it"
5,highest honors,"Went looking for With Honors and not only found it, but got The Super as a bonus. Great deal....love it!!!"
4,It's Ture imitation of a Slumb Lord,Joe Pesci was just awsome in this movie as slum lord. I'd have to say he played the part very well because I knew a slum lord and all he wanted was the rent money. The house was a falling about and he didn't care. It was pretty funny too. Rob Daniel and Joe Pesci worked well together. This is a funny movie and one who went through this sould see this and can relate to it.
4,The super,This is a great movie. Joe Pesci Rocks and is a very funny comedian. His performance in the super is legendary.
1,the super/with honors,both of these movies i thought were boring.And the content well let me say was very inapproaiate.to me i just didn't like it at all.
4,The Super/With Honors,The Super is a classic funny movie with Joe Pesci. DVD worked fine. I didn't care too much about With Honors.
2,Falls Short For Kids Training Film - May Help New Coaches,"Not helpful as a kids training aid. Uses college players instead of kids to demonstrate skills. Kids can't relate to adults learning fundamentals. Also, too much talking. Great for a new coach who wants to see the correct way a skill should be applied or helpful tricks of the trade such as the protecting hand to defend against a cross over dribble."
3,Best suited for an intermediate network administrator.,"If you have already read TCP/IP Illustrated Vol 1, don't waste your time with this book. It had a useful chapter about access lists on Ciscos, but other than that I found it to be a very long (410 pages) of review material."
5,"Informative, thorough, and interesting","A very informative, thorough, and interesting coverage of the topic. Very well written and an enjoyable read. I especially liked the presentation of the ""chapters"" as ""premises.""Advocacy is one theme of this book, but I didn't find that objectionable. As a former professional in the regulatory field, I think it is important for people with opinions to express them!This book is really a must-read for people working on any aspect of biological monitoring of aquatic systems."
3,"Good Manual, but quite broad","As with most Haynes manuals, this one is very good. The one major failing is that it covers a very large timeframe (1970-1999). As a result, much of the information must be either carefully read/selected to ensure it applies to your specific model and/or interpreted to the engine version you have. They really should have split it into pre-Evolution models and post Evolution models.This also means you will not find any specifics instructions on items such as fairing removal/installation, instrumentation, cruise control, or other body and chassis type items -- there are simply too may variations for a single book to cover.That is why I would rate this manual one star less than the typical Haynes manual which is generally more focused towards a specific model and vehicle."
4,Quit the Day Job,"Of the three celtic influenced punk, Real McKenzies, Dropkick Murphys & Flogging Molly that I'm familiar with, these guys are my top choice. High energy, joyous, double bagpipes integrated in every song. Best songs: Flowers of Scotland - an acoustic traditional plea, Swords of a thousand Men - anthematic & sounds like half of Vancouver's doing backup vocals, Wild Cattieyote and Nessie - great opener. Great vocals throughout. Four stars cause there's room for improvement & I hope they can quit their day job's and focus on this real deal music."
4,Getting there......,"This is the 3rd sudio effort from this band (who have quickly risen as one of my favorites). It shows much more polish and focus than the sophmoric ""Clash of Tartans"". Most of the album is paced well, but seems to lose steam on the last three songs. A more careful arrangement of tunes could have solved that... Overall though the CD is just a lot of fun and is ten times better than half the crud that is put out as music and entertainment these days that top the charts. BUY IT !!! and then go to the website, see them live and support these hard working, drunk slobs!! They obviously love what they do and appreciate it!!"
4,Bagpipes and Guitars,"If you like the more melodic 'Dropkick Murphys' songs and enjoy the combination of Bagpipes and Power Guitars, then look no further: This CD has all these elements : Great Sing-along choruses, high speed guitars and lots of Bagpipes. I actually like the vocals better than 'Flogging Molly', and even there is still a bit of room to improve on the songwriting in my opinion, I strongly recommend buying this album. It is just pure fun!"
1,Utter Garbage,"This is total dross, to compare them to The Dropkick Murphys or Flogging Molly is an insult to both these bands.If they came anywhere near Scotland and performed like this they would be flung off the top of Edinburgh Castle and then shot at with the one o'clock gun.Pity you couldn't get no stars."
5,The Bible,This is the basic book of every Luger collector. You cannot have a collection or even one Luger and not appreciate something the book has to offer. A must have.
3,Decent,"It's like a candy apple read. YOu don't read it for substance, you read it for fun. I didn't like all of the characters, a good number of them were annoying. I've read better. I considered giving this 2 stars but that seemed too harsh. Basically, 2 and a half out of five."
2,Cheap but it works,"Fits camel 99s perfectly. The ""leather"" is coming out of the frame and I have had it less than a week."
3,Rickety Raceway,"Thought this would be a great toy for a four year old boy. He loved the cars and wanted to race them on the track, but we had a hard time getting them to run consistantly. Even the adults could not get them to run. It was hard to put together and stay assembled. After one afternoon of trying to get the cars to run properly, we were ready to give up on the whole thing."
2,Very frustrating for kids and adults!,"I would not recommend this toy at all. In fact, it is now on it's way to Good Will from our house. It is very difficult to assemble, does not stay together, and the cars have a lot of difficulty staying connected with the track. We finally gave up and are sending it away!"
4,"A ""How-To"" For Early Childhood Standards With Great Layouts","The layout makes this book stand out. Each chapter not only features an on-point discussion of a specified universal state standard (decoding, legibility, listening/communication, etc.) but also offers the most common practices that teachers utilize to meet that standard.It enlightens both a beginning and veteran teacher."
2,Missing pages,I was happy with the book until I had to read Chapter 4 and found out that Chapter 4 had been removed from the book.
3,Content Learning Standards,"Although this book was helpful, I was hoping it was more connected with the state of Ohio's learning standards."
5,Great headset,I purchased this for use at work for teleconferencing. Sound quality is great. People on the other end can hear me very well. I work in an office with a bit of background noise from air handling equipment overhead. There is not a lot of background voice noise though.One word of caution. I am using this with a Cisco 7940 VOIP phone. The cable that Amazon suggests (CSTD 01) does not work with this phone. I purchased cable CSTD 08 for use with this phone from another vendor.
4,i like,"this is a good watering can. the swivel spout is an ingenious idea: it's clear enough to see the water level in the can and, when folded back, keeps water from sloshing out while you carry it from faucet to plant. it holds enough water that you don't have to make quite so many trips back and forth from the faucet. the grip is wide and comfy. the engineering provides good balance when it's full of water and is easy to pour. my only beef, and it's no fault of the product, is that it's too tall to fit under my kitchen faucet, which is where i usually fill my watering cans. still, i can use my detachable shower head in the bath to solve that little inconvenience.i would recommend this watering can for major outdoor watering needs. pick a smaller more nimble one for your smaller indoor plants."
2,Great design but leaks,"I ordered this watering can because it looks so attractive. But the first time I used it, it leaked at the bottom of the spout, where the black joint is. It was all over my kitchen countertop. I should have known that any joint has the possibility of leaking. I returned it. I think this might work if it is strictly used outdoor."
2,"Should only be read by beginners, but beware, bad tutorials","I bought this book after reading the 5 star reviews, and have to admit to being dissappointed with it. Most of the tutorials are for absolute beginners, and the one tutorial I was interested in, the tornado animation, is very badly presented. If you follow this tutorial by the book, you will end up in a mess, which is because the author neglects to mention certain things like 'position your goal null below the last bone', otherwise leaving it where the author leaves it will distort your tornado out of all recognition. There are spelling mistakes at the crucial surface info like 'smoothing on, amount=0.0?? The picture quality in the book is very poor, especially if you want to compare your work with a tutorial. Captions under the pictures saying things like 'the object with the correct polygons selected' are just plain grey all over. I felt I'd wasted my money with this book."
1,lightwave pover guide,"Could not recommend this book to anybody.Being experienced 3d animator and using Softimage and 3Dmax for many years, was able to use this book with the big DIFFICULTIES! A lot of useless information for the book which claims it would introduce you into the new software....what for I need to know the Authors' ideas about ""how to write bills to the clients""?...I would prefer to have more info about the Modeler...For my opinion, there is luck of logic in the structure - both of the book and the CD.NOT WORTH its money :-("
4,"Still usefull, but that's LW 5.0","Before I bought this book I had read all the comments you can see above, and had been full of hopes that it is gonna be a very informative and full-of-tricks book. Well, it's Ok about general features of LW, but there is a few info about up-to-date technics and poor examples. I'd rather recommend ""Inside LW"" by Dan Ablan, it's all about LW5.5"
1,Uh... what?,"I acquired the software used - without any manuals. So, I purchased this book in hopes that it would help me to learn the software. I was disappointed. The author obviously believed his readers would already have some experience with the software. (Perhaps if you already have some experience with Lightwave, this book will prove to be a big help to you.) I have ordered another book from Amazon which is supposed to include some tutorials. I'm hoping that after reading the new book and going through the tutorials, this book might provide some further insight. (Got my fingers crossed)"
2,Huh? what? the movie is on?,Hmmmm maybe i don't understand it but no this movie just wasn't funny...thats about it
4,Choice Movie,"Excellent follow of the first movie. Scary, sad and funny; the makings of a movie for everybody."
4,The Gods Must be Crazy,"I'd really like to get hold of a copy of The Gods Must be Crazy as it is something rather unusual and refreshing. I also have seen The Gods Must be Crazy 2 but this is not nearly as good. I do not think either of them ever appeared in the UK, which is a shame, but we can play back American videos here as well as read/write PAL."
3,Walking Book for women,"The book is specifically written for women, I am a little disappointed in the attitude of the aerobics instructor author, but the information is generally good and teh book is well produced."
2,For New Walkers Only,"I am a big fan of Leslie Sansone and her walking tapes and have several for variety and love them all. I recently bought this book based on the reviews of others but found it really was geared to those who are new to walking. There is one small chapter for advanced walkers but it doesn't really tell you anything you don't already know if you currently do Leslie's tapes.If you are just starting out walking, you may find this book contains some good information and inspirational stories. But if you are already a ""Walker"", your money is better spent on a new Leslie Sansone DVD to make sure you have variety in your workouts and a subscription to Weight Watchers magazine, which will provide you with more insight into healthier eating habits.I returned my book. Sorry Leslie."
4,Plan is achievable.,"Although I have not yet completed the plan, I do feel that the material in this book is achievable. She walks (pardon the pun)through the steps at a pace that anyone could work with. I am giving it a try."
4,Pretty and Affordable,"This is a lovely little ring that fits comfortably and looks nice without totally flattening your wallet. The only issue I had with it is that the ring itself is rather malleable, and somewhat prone to denting. On the whole, however, I am quite pleased and would recommend this item to anyone."
5,TAYLOR'S BEST,"Mystery readers tend to confine their interests to one corner of the genre, and in my case, it's English mysteries, particularly golden-age cozies. Alas, there are only so many of them, and this is not one. But never mind. It is a brilliant story. The narrative drive sweeps you along; the characters are believable; one event unfolds into another for a build-up to a deliciously clever ending. It is in the form of a scavenger hunt, informed by a pleasant, witty intelligence. The rest of the books in the series are not as good. I also like Taylor's Lydmouth series; those stories are satisfying, but not the good clean fun that this is."
3,An Ok Book,"It's an ok story but I don't know that I'd buy another book from the same author. The ""lack of conventional morals"" aspect of the main characters was probably more interesting when the book was first published than it is today (which is kind of sad). So without that aspect to create interest, the story itself is kind of pedestrian."
4,Comfortable,These shoes are really comfortable and reasonably warm to wear. They appear to be well made and will likely be durable. The sizing is a tad on the small size - my feet are 10-11 and the mocs are tight but not too tight. The availability of only medium width for my wide feet is not as good as having a wide width available.
3,Cold Rain and Snow,"I love his work on Invisible Means with French, Frith and Thompson, but this song is worth the price of admission alone."
5,Fits perfect,I was a bit nervous to order car parts online because they never seem to be the right fit but this mirror worked perfectly.
2,No Substitute for Badger Hair,"If you're vegan, it'll work, but if you can use badger hair then DO! This brush does produce adiquate lather, and for the price is a quality, sturdy shave tool. But it is nowhere near as soft and efficient at lathering as even a ""best"" badger hair brush."
1,Sterling Silver Stud Earrings,"Very disappointed in the size. Not until this review request did the description state ""Tiny"". The word ""Tiny"" is an understatement.""Microscopic"" is a better description. I believe there will be a problem at any attempt to put these on the ear because they are absolutely too small."
2,Not What I Expected,"This is not a comic strip collection. It is more along the lines of the ""Love is..."" and ""Happiness is..."" books of the seventies. I am a ""Rose is Rose"" junkie but if I had walked into a book store and seen it first, I probably wouldn't have bought it."
5,I love it,Rose is Rose is my favorite strip. It reminds me in some ways of my family. My folks are very close and I am a spoiled only child. Peekaboo is almost a carbon copy in her demeanor of my cat Animal. It's the most gentle strip in the papers and it really is my favorite. Thanks Pat.
3,"Nice as a gift, but I wouldn't have bought it","I received the book as a Christmas gift. Ten minutes later, I was finished reading it. Like one other reviewer, I am used to more ""meat"" in a comics book. If it was supposed to be a coffee table experience, it should have been sold in hardback with a glossy cover."
1,content and animation are not up to par,"I believe this book was nto the way ti whould have been. I believe it was very dry and unfunny. I had many strips that seemed to make no sense, and others so bland I could barely stand to reas them. the other thing I disliked was the animation. It seemed to have no depth or perception, and feel it could have been done much better wuiet easily. I realize my opinions do not agree witht he other readers, but it is just how I feel."
1,"horrible, the worst","After receiving this jewerely cleaner, I can honestly say it was the worst purchase I have had in a very long time. The cleaner sounds like a bomb waiting to explode. I am truely afraid that it will ruin my jewerly or worse explode in my house and have pieces of debris fly everywhere. Stupid me, I threw the box away before usage and cannot return."
2,MAYBE BETTER FOR FRILLING,"MARINATED CHICKEN FOR 24HRS, BAKED IN OVEN, MORE BLAND THAN SPICY, MAYBE BETTER AS A GRILLING SAUCE, WON'T PURCHASE AGAIN, STICKING WITH GRANULATED CHIPOLTE SEASONING, MUCH MORE FLAVORFUL IN OVEN COOKING, MORE USES."
3,What is everyone thinking? Read the is review before buying,"First off this is a review of Zoids Choatic Century series as a whole. Second I would have given this a 3.5 if I could.ZCC is by far the best zoids series in the franchise. That still isn't saying much, this is just your average big robo anime. The voice acting is okay, the graphics again okay, the plot is slightly above average. This is a long series that has a lot twists but its just not the amazing legendary anime everyones making it out to be. Make no mistake this is nowhere near the league of say gundam or EVA. This is your anime you pop in if you have kids or just want something to do du to. Normally I would say save your money but the series cost 12.99 each brand new so try it out if you like then go on if you don't then you only wasted 12 dollors not a terrible waste."
5,Has this album already been forgotten?,"This is one of the most important of the mid-nineties hardcore albums. When everyone was releasing either straight-edge or tough guy hardcore, Refused released their thesis on anarchy. Don't forget this record.Their painWon't endTheir painWon't endWith blood in my eyesI won't see the light shineWith blood in my eyesI won't see the light shineWith blood in your eyesYou won't see the light shine"
3,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"IF PURCHASED FROM ""ANTOnline"" BUYER BEWARE.THIS IS ADVERTISED AS ""VALUE PACK"".THE ONLY VALUE IS IT CONTAINS THE TWO RADIOS ONLY.""VALUE PACK"" = SALE BASIC RADIO AND MAKE YOUR MONEY OFF SELLINGTHE BATTERIES AND CHARGER!NO BATTERIES INCLUDED AND NO CHARGER INCLUDED.IF THIS SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT VALUE TO YOU THEN ""BUY IT""."
3,Quite oversight of the Utes,"A quick read that bradly covers the Utes. Not indepth, but an overview that gives the reader a passable basic understanding of this Native American Nation. Lots of photographs that I had not seen before from the 1870's.This is a good book if you want a quite history, but do not need or desire a very indepth history of the Utes."
3,History presented in sound bites.,"Utes: The Mountain People, attempts to cover every historic, social, and political aspect of Ute culture and life in 178 pages. And the book is liberally sprinkled with photographs. The result is ""sound bite"" writing, with some topics being given only a few paragraphs and none given more than a few to ten pages. The book is like a collection of museum information panels, condensed for quick reading. If you are looking for depth in any one aspect of Ute history and culture, this is not the best choice you can make and you will come away with more questions about the Utes than answers. If you need a quick over view, or resource for a high school level report, this might be a good introduction. If you want more detail and to get a better historical perspective, I suggest The Ute Indians of Utah, Colorado and New Mexico by Virginia McConnell Simmons."
4,Very Useful and Great Teaching Tool,"This is a wonderful 20 minute book/CD. I use it as an introduction in my primary music classes for our unit on musical instruments and the instrument families. The kids actually maintain attention fairly well through the entire 20 minutes as long as you let them clap or sing along when appropriate on certain pages (others they need to be quiet and listen to the beautiful music on the CD). They can identify with some of the rhythm instruments and learn about others, expecially strings.A good buy for anyone actually."
5,Mystery Author!,"This has been a family favorite for us for many years. But no one seems to know who wrote it! Kathryn Meyrick did the wonderful illustrations, and Patrick MacNee's narration is priceless, but there is no author credit anywhere. We originally got it through Discovery Toys and asked them, but they didn't know either. Can anyone solve the mystery?"
5,No Fluff Here!,"Thomas Watson exemplifies the nature of Puritan writing. This book is very practical, and is not emotive in it's theology. If you want to apply the Scriptures in a practical manner, this book is the ticket. If you're looking for ""Evangelical fluff,"" go to your local Christian bookstore."
5,Well worth your money and time,"This book is a gem. For those men who are genuinely seeking to know godliness in their own lives, this book is invaluable. Watson lays out in such simple terms what it means to be a man of God. However, I will say this: Read this book over time; don't speed through it. After you read a portion, sit in it for a few days. Then return for another round. God bless.[...]"
2,Kindle edition: modified and based on NIV!,"My two star rating is not based on the content, but on this Kindle edition. The formatting is awful, no table of contents, and it has been modified! The texts quoted are from a Bible translation based on corrupted manuscripts with dozens of verses missing (the NIV). This leads to weird distortions in the text where Thomas Watson discusses a portion of scripture but the words are not found in the quoted portion.Unfortunately I cannot recommend this edition, but have given 1 star for effort."
2,Good for close range...,"I just purchased these radios because I wanted a long-range two way communications system. I go paintballing, fishing, hiking alot. I tested them out by having someone at my house with one, and then I drove in my car with the other one. I wasn't impressed at all, I only got about 1 1/2 miles out of them, even on high power. I don't live in the mountains, city, or thick woods either.Although they didn't get that long of a range out of them, I still recommend them if you are going hiking or biking. I also like the ""tactical headsets"" that go with radios.Bottom line, don't get them expecting to get a 5-14 mile range. That only happens in open areas. But, you really have no choice if you want two-way-radios because the 14 mile range is the maximum they make right now."
5,everything I wanted and more !,they work great. they have all the power you would ever need. you can't beat the warranty. the price was the best I found. very happy with the product.
3,must be mistaken,It's ok but to whoever made this manikin do not put caucasian hair on a manikin that is named CELEBRITY WHITNEY AFRO MANIKIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHITNEYS HAIR IS NOT THAT TEXTURE ALSO. KNOW YOUR ETHNICITY DUMB ASSES!!!. other than that its alright. No bald spots or thin patches.
1,Nice but nothing new,"As much as I like the author's ""Building Construction"", this book is not recommended. It is based on the premise that many construction details share common principles: shed water by using sloping surfaces, for instance. After a few such groupings are described, it turns into a tips and tricks collection, e.g., do rough work before finish work. It's not a comprehensive reference by any means. On the contrary, it's shamefully padded with many nearly blank pages. Enjoyable reading, nice drawings, just not nearly enough material to justify the price."
5,Product iin excellent condition,"This book came quite fast, in excellent condition. Very happy with this purchase. It was bought as a gift for Christmas and it made someone very happy. Thanks for such great service..."
2,Reviewing Daniel Morgan:Revolutionary Rifleman,"The book arrived with the typical swiftness of Amazon. It was in questionable condition BUT this was known to me before purchase (I went the cheap route). The book itself is written like a text book. Very factual, with a ton of footnotes, but not exactly enjoyable to read due to this aspect. But, if you are looking for true facts about this great American this book should deliver."
1,Too easily clogged.,This product is not worth the money. As you shave your head the blades begin to get clogged up with hair and the design of the razor blades don't allow them to be easily cleaned.
2,Didn't work for me,I bought this for my fiancee because he was starting to shave down to the skin and it ended up taking a chunk out of his skin. He prefers the weight of his normal razor for shaving his head now and we got rid of this.
3,Over packaged,It gets the bulk of the hair but I still have to finish the job with a hand held razor. Be careful when opening the package because it is sealed up like Fort Knox. When I cut the top off and pulled the plastic apart the Headblade flew out and fell in the sink causing the blade holder to break. Fortunately the package was supplied with an additional blade holder that works with most blades you get with disposable razors.
4,Excelent,"I use it in the shower to shave the portions that i can not see,the rest in front of the mirror.No problems at all"
3,Could be better,I bought this for my partner because he had been talking about getting one for months. I was hoping he would enjoy the razor. The razor actually cuts pretty good. The main issue is that it clogs up very easy and the hair is hard to remove. After every stroke triple the effort was spent cleaning the hair out of the razor. After 3 strokes we both decided to just go back to clipper.
3,NOT FOR NEWBIE,I was just using a reglar stick razor...then i got this and i had some more razors for this one and now i have a cut on my head so when you use this BECAREFUL or you'll be sore
3,"Cool gadget, average shave","I really wanted to like the headblade, but it's just an average product.PROS: Cool gadget. Fairly quick shave. I didn't cut myself. The instructions are clear that you are not supposed to apply pressure.CONS: The shave just isn't very close. It's not bad. It's just not great. Still have to use another razor to get behind the ears.I ordered some Gillete Atra refill cartridges which are supposed to work with the headblade. Maybe the shave will be a little closer. The blades that come with it gunk up easily and are hard to clean out.Headblade should spend more time effort and energy in getting a better blade - like a Mach 3 blade."
4,head blade,it make shaving your head a breeze. I highly recommend this product to anyone that shaves there head. its really simple to use and well worth the money
1,Poorly Designed,"I've been shaving my head for 20 years now and have tried everything to get a quick, thorough shave. I was excited upon seeing the possibilities of something aimed at guys who shaved their heads. I was extremely disappointed. It feels odd, cumbersome, and ineffective. I would really like to see who they did their test market with because I'm floored that it made it to prime time. Seriously, based on my extensive experience. If you want a great, fast, thorough shave, use the Gillette Fusion razor with the electric mode. It really works well."
1,open to new tech,"Oh my god!!!!! I pulled this accross my head six to eight times, starting in the back of my head... and before I knew what was happining blood was running down my neck and I had 5 serious cuts before I stopped..It took one week to heal before I could use my fusion again. Horrible! Danderous, overpriced product."
4,Great Head Shave,This is a great product for shaving the head. It nearly eliminates the nicks and cuts the standard razor tends to produce. The wheels in the back of the device help to keep the blades at the correct angle for a great shave every time.
1,Nicks and cuts,"This razor looks good on paper and has a futuristic design but doesn't work so well in practice. The thing to remember is that if you don't have a flexible blade which shapes itself to your scalp, nicks and cuts will inevitably follow.Unlike others who've reviewed this product, it just didn't work for me. The small hook to place your finger in just didn't provide enough control over the device. The Atra razors were below par as well.My recommendation: get yourself a package of Schick Xtreme-3 disposable razors. The blades are wonderfully flexible and the long handle gives one plenty of control. I've been shaving my head for the past five years, and the Xtreme-3 is the best product to date."
1,Don't ask...Don't buy...Stay Away!!!,"I bought this Headblade razor and used it only twice. The fact that the Headblade uses Atra blades (which werte popular during the mid-1980s but which are undoubtedly inferior to advanced shaving systems like the Gillette Fusion or Schick Quattro) should serve as a warning that you won't get a smooth or comfortable shave. I experienced severe razor burn and also got many nicks and cuts during the two times I used the Headblade and then threw it away. If you want a smooth, clean and comfortable shave then I truly recommend the Gillette Fusion as it gives me an ultra-smooth and clean shave every time. The Headblade is an interesting-looking product but it just does not work (even remotely) as well as more advanced 4 or 5-blade razors."
5,"After a year, would not go back to a regular razor.","I've been using the Headblade 3-4 times per week, for about a year, and there is no way I could go back to a traditional razor at this point; I've tried and it just feels unnatural in comparison. I will admit to being a little over zealous the first time I used it, which resulted in the worst cut I've ever had while shaving, but that wasn't the fault of the Headblade; You need to take your time while learning to shave with this thing!After a week of so of careful shaving it becomes second nature to use. I can shave my entire head in the shower, without a mirror, in about 2 minutes. After that I touch up around my ears with a traditional razor. As other have mentioned, this works best with a good blade on it. I've been using SensorExcel blades exclusively and the cost/performance ratio is perfect. I should also mention that I don't have any abnormal bumps or divots on my noggin, so your mileage may vary."
2,"novel approach, but average performance","I have to agree with the other negative reviews-this razor is tough to maneuver around the ears and really chewed up the back of my head. I would also agree that even the inexpensive three blade disposable razors do an equal, if not better, job than the headblade. Headblade nicked more in one shaving than I have in dozens of times using a traditional two or three bladed razor. The novelty of this razor quickly diminished after multiple nicks. Yes, there's the cool factor, but not at the expense of pieces of scalp washing down the drain. I did like the mentholated shaving cream, though."
1,Does not give a close shave,"Does not give a close shave, not happy with this product. It did not give as good a shave as advertised."
2,Headblade Razor,It's not for me. Just didn't get the close shave that I thought I'd get. Still had to go back over my head with a different razor to get what the cut I needed.
1,piece of junk,"poor design, difficult to use; don't push too hard, you'll cut yourself, cause it's unatural to ""push"" the blade over your skin, rather than ""pull"" the blades as with most other shaving blades."
1,Nothing Like Advertised,"I bought this razor when I first shaved my head because I was led to believe it would be easier and safer than using my regular razor, but have the same result. Unfortunately that was not the case. There is no way to get a clean shave with this razor. If you want your head to be clean shaven, save your $15 and buy new replacement blades for your regular razor. If, however, you don't mind having visible stubble right after you shave, this may be a good razor for you."
1,Headblade,"Not all that great. I use a Mach 3, but found the Fusion better. I love thier lotions though."
2,not so sure about this product,"I'm a mostly bald guy, with some hair on the back of my head. This sytem does not do a great job either cutting with or against the hair growth pattern. I'm using my regular razor, instead, which makes me nervous, but it gets the job done more easily. And I went to the store and bought new blades...arrrrrrgh!"
1,Taking Advantage of Bald Men With A Gimick Product,"DO NOT BUY!!!This razor is a GIMMICKY and HORRIBLE design! Headblade touts their usable and trademark ""wheel"" design AS ""revolutionary"", but this is in no way easier to use than a standard razor.If you use it the way it's designed then you are only able to shave a strip of hair HALF the width of a conventional razor! I tried to redeem this purchase by using it on my face instead, but again.. it's too crapy for that, too!The only place I have left to shave is my nether-region, which this thing is not even worthy to touch. Keep your training wheels, Headblade. And scoot back to the lab to work on a better design."
2,tricky,"I got this for my husband after he saw it on TV. He said it works okay, but prefers a regular razor. This can be tricky and hard to use."
2,Not for my husband,"My husband shaves his head every nite and thought this to be the perfect gift. Bought it as a stocking stuffer for Christmas....boy was I wrong. He said to just give him a regular shaver for his need. The first time he used it, of course not being ready for it, he cut a huge chunk out of his head. Probably a great tool for some, just not us."
1,Never cut myself until I got this.,"I am surprised by the reviews. I have used this thing three times and I still hate it. Third time cut myself (new blades every time). Each time, I had to use a regular razor to go back over things. Doesn't work very well around the ears, doesn't give a close shave (may be the gilette blades). Does a good job on top of the head, but not on sides or back.Going back to my standard 3-bladed disposable."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this razor because I thought it would give me a closer and quicker shave in the morning. It gave neither. It wasn't very ergonomic so maybe with more practice it would give a quick shave in the morning but I wasn't planning to practice shaving all over again. I thought that the motion of the shave would be just like running your fingers through the scalp but it ain't so.The blades are inferior. I love blades with an open back so the water can wash off all the little hairs that get stuck in between the blades. This has some old-school blade that is really hard to clean between strokes. You can use certain 3rd party blades with the included adapter but those blades have the same problem (I used those in the past).To sum up, use your favorite razor, the one you use for your beard, on your scalp. It's much more effective. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I'm nice."
1,New Shaver Or Self Sacrifice?,"I got one of these as a gift from a friend who thought it was a great idea. Of course, he has a full head of hair.It took me 20 minutes to stop the bleeding enough that I could drive to work. It cut, scraped, gouged and nicked it's way across my scalp like a vampire in search of a good meal.I threw it in the trash and went back to my Fusion Power."
1,worst shave of my life,I got this as a present and before using it I thought it would be great WRONG.This thing is the worst razor i have ever used. I cannot stress that enough my first thought when using it was where is my bandaids before i bleed to death i am amazed that it can cut you so severly without cutting the hair it is beyond akward to use.I have been shaving for 10 years and have even used the single blade razors you can buy one at a time from a truck stop which are much more effective than this.Use a butter knife you will be better off.
5,amazing,"I just got my headblade today and I love it , took my about maybe 10 mins to shave and it was great no nicks or cuts and my head is nice and smooth , I have looked at a lot of reviews and was kinda worried that i bought this for nothing , but I was amazed how close the shave was and how close of a cut I got out of it , I will never go back to a regular razor i love the headblade"
1,regular razors are much better!!,"I've been using a gillette mach 3 razor for about 3 years to shave my head....thought i would give this a try.....What a bad idea!!!After a few passes, i was cut so badly in the back of my head, and it bled for about 10 minutes. There was actually a big chunk of skin left in the razor blade. I will never use this product again. In the 3 years of using a regular razor....i was never cut or nicked so severely."
2,"Looked promising, but....","Initially it looked like a good solution, after a couple of nicks, i thought i am not doing it right. Okay tried with patience, but didnt stay that way, the worse is behind the ears, no matter how i am careful i ended up with nicks and cuts there. If they put a little more thought in improving the nicks and cuts it might be good, hey that's why they had barbers through the ages. But for now i am ditching this, a mach 3 works better for now."
1,below expectations,I couldn't get a close shave and no matter what I did it left streaks on my head. I finally had to revert to my electric razor to cleanup the mess.
2,Not a close shave,"I guess the idea here was to provide a nick-proof shave on bald heads, and that it does; however, it's not a close shave. A careful shave with a good blade like a Gillette Fusion produces an incredibly smooth result. The HeadBlade manages to give you the equivalent of a two-day stubble in comparison. Perhaps this is due to the old-tech two blade system used by HeadBlade, but if you're going for the smooth, bald look this isn't the product to get it with."
1,Poorly designed,"For all of the bragging on the company's website about blade design, this product doesn't deliver.The major flaw comes in the form of how the razor deals with cut hair. The hair is trapped by the plastic housing surrounding the blades, clogging the blade, and rendering it useless within a single swipe. I was hoping it would be able to outperform the gillette fusion, but it comes nowhere near the performance (granted the fusion costs more). The gillette has a completely open design which allows hair to pass between the blades and easily wash away. I have only tried the sport version of this product, but I doubt I'll waste my money trying the others. I've used generic three blade razors with better performance. The fusion costs more, but it works."
3,Love it and Hate it,"I love the idea of this product, the cool marketing, the design, and even the price and color. However, I hate the actual use of the headBlade as my head is not perfectly round - if it were, it'd probably be easier to use. Learning to use it is a real challenge and this is my second purchase over three years. The first time I didn't like it - so I thought I'd give it a shot again - and I'm still not a fan."
2,Skip this one,"The title says it all: Well-designed but cheaply made unit. Flimsy blade mount that comes off too easily. Wheels break off (not ""pop"" off to be easily snapped back on) if you are unlucky enough to drop it in the sink. In fairness, however, you can silicone the wheels into place (they will not rotate) and use it, but you can do wheelies on your dome without risking loss of the treads. Why bother? Get a multi-head electric shaver instead."
4,A journey inside a puzzle that is an enigma.,"Rawle's book is graphically beautiful. He tells the story of Michael Whittingham, who decides to take up photography as a hobby and stumbles into a mystery.To tell the truth, I didn't know what to make of the book. Was everything I was reading true, or was it going on in Michael's head. The coincidences were unbelievable, but were they really happening, or were they also in Michael's head. Although I found the 'album' enchanting, it belonged to a rather sick individual, and I became uncomfortable being so intimately involved in his paranoid thoughts and actions. I'd like some idea of what this fascinating story was really about!"
1,Bad Fit,"Bought this for a Honda Civic. The box is marked correctly for a Civic of the correct year, but the item barely fits. The screw holes do not align to any holes (I'd have to drill into the hood), and the sticky pads are in areas that makes only minimal contact with the hood. I've had to modify it to fit.I recommend finding a different product."
2,I Really Wanted to Like This More,"You know the author is in trouble when you're skipping over very mediocre sex scenes and the fiftieth exclamation of ""Oh, Zach!"" and just reading the plot. Kate Hill does an injustice to two very likeable characters and a promising premise by repetitive writing and boring romantic scenes. Zach's life in the mines and his subsequent refusal to marry Sophia, with whom he shares dreams, is done very well and has emotional resonance. His transformation is what kept me reading through to the end, even though I was laughing out loud during what were supposed to be hot sex scenes -- I think the author just gave up on these two. This is the weakest of the three ""Stallion"" books. Dream Stallion is much more creative and enjoyable."
5,best vocabulary book out there,I have not seen a better book anywhere else. Everything is well placed within the book. It is a book I would recommend to anyone who is studying German on their own and have a basic command of the language
1,Seller misrepresented the product,"The product is excellent, but i was VERY sissapointed with the seller...with many options to buy it I shoosed this one cause it says: 100-count bottles,(pack of two)...Obviously means you are getting two bottles with 100 pills each, but not, i got two bottles of 50 each instead...I ended paying a lot more that what i paid to other sellers, you can see in my other review of the product."
5,As advertised,My order was received promptly and I got 2 100-count bottles. Can't beat the price or service. Thanks.
2,A Disappointing Effort,"It is a bit disconcerting to read a book that starts out as nonfiction but its latter two-thirds is largely fictional. In retelling the story of Abdulla Haran, a religious leader in Cape Town, South Africa's Coloured Muslim community who fought against apartheid, the authors chose to devote most of this slender book to his arrest, torture and eventual death while in the custody of the police in 1969. Instead of rendering a useful social and political analysis of the Coloured population in the context of South Africa's racial hierarchy, the reader is burdened with the long, brutal ordeal of Haron's martyrdom reconstructed as it might have happened based on documented evidence and the melodramatic imagination of the authors complete with dialog."
5,"After a long wait, a departure","T. R. Pearson departs the style that made him a favorite of mine, reminiscent of sitting on a porch with a glass of tea, listening to a series of raconteurs spinning yarns and gossip. His previous books, all set in the same imaginary County, flowed in a honeyed stream, causing more than one bursts of laughter. Now this more conventional yet totally original book has surfaced. And I for one am glad."
3,"Great writing, disappointing finish","I really enjoyed the first three-quarters of this book. I believed it was shaping up to deliver a devastatingly creative resolution to the two parallel mysteries that cleverly weave around one another, but the fact is that the resolution was, to me at least, pedestrian and predictable. The two Tatum brothers, each of whom is central to the simultaneous stories, are nicely drawn and developed characters, and it isn't that their stories are necessarily unbelievable (though I found the New York hoodlum Giles pretty hard to believe). I think the strong start and unconventional narrative built me up to expect a much stronger finish. Sadly, it was exactly what I expect from a murder mystery, which is why I don't generally read them. Luckily for me I bought it at a used book store for [money ammount]; had I paid full price I would probably have been even more disappointed."
1,Ugh!,"I hate to disagree with everyone else, but I found this book simple minded and almost unnerving in the author's language usage. A sentence does not need to be convoluted to be interesting, but this man seems to think muddled is the same as complex. When I read, I read first of all for language and then for character and plot. I found all three elements poorly handled in this book. I disliked it enough to never go near Pearson again."
5,Witty science fiction and deserving of reprinting,"I, Vampire is diverting, amusing, and witty as it skewers the pretensions of the human race. Jody Scott is a marvel. She perhaps surpasses her earlier novel, Passing for Human, weighing in mightily with both comedic and archly dark observations. Her prose zings and sparkles and wryly digs into popular culture."
2,Great Story,This book series is one of the best I have read in a while. I recommend it to everyone who enjoys reading. Although I cant wait till the next one comes out. I read them all in 3 days I could not put them down.
4,Interesting lives... just exaggerated,"This was actually a good read. I know I'm reading this book after it has been out for 4 years now. However, I'm glad I did read it. I was feeling all of the characters. It made you feel like you knew them. The only problem I have with this book, like I have with most ghetto, drugs, money, and hoes books are the Authors tend to exaggerate on money etc, these hustlers make. I mean yes, some hustlers do get money. However, in most incidences, it's NOT THAT SERIOUS. But I guess for entertainment purposes- WHY NOT? I just roll my eyes when I read the same exaggeration of money.But read it for entertainment. I'm not gonna lie, I couldn't put the book down."
3,Started strong and very grown up but tapered off.,"I thought the author was going somewhere with the Angel and the check scheme, especially after every piece of clothing was designer driven. The mall opening was a great hook that roped me in, but once the story started reflecting on backfill, it read kinda ""young"", high school-ish. The cover art features mature adults, but the characters had an extremely youthful appeal. Maybe it was the voice. And Angel was ""high yellow"" the cover featured a brown skinned female. Anyway, it was a decent read."
5,If loving a thug is wrong . . . i don't want to be right!,"Thugs and the Women Who Love Them takes readers into the lives of three best friends bent on making it out of the hood. All three are in college and working on their degrees to better themselves and their lives. But will the thugs in the lives prevent this? Angel, a law student, is in love with Snake, a notorious pimp ""by blood not relation."" Kyra, a psychology student, is in love with not one, but two drug dealers. Jaz, a chemist in the making, is loving Faheem, a liquor store owner by day and money counterfeiter by night. Will these three accomplish their goals of making it? You'll have to read and see. Great debut novel Wahida!! Looking forward to reading much more from you."
5,Love it!,I love reading this book all 4 books waiting for the 5th book to come out I had my mother reading them
5,Jazzy@38,"I haven't read this book yet,but I did read Every Thug Needs A Lady.....I thought it was an excellent story.....Although I'm still trying to find my Trae Or Kaylin or maybe both!!!!"
3,Dont know what to say!,"This book will leave you hanging,simple as that. So thank God I read the following sequels after this book.But real talk this book wasnt THAT good like how I was expecting it to be, The characters were under developed,certain scenes and story lines were incomplete and all over the place,etc..etc...etc...I am trying to remain a loyal fan of Wahida Clark's books but it is really getting hard with these half a** unrealistic novels!! The beginning started off really good but as it got closer to the middle and end of the book the worse the story got,no details or nothing! Sorry but true!"
1,Did Ricki Lake write this?,"Did she cop the pseudonym to be down with the sistas? A think a better title would be ""Thugs and The Dopes Who Love Them."" Peace out. Word etc."
2,it should have been titled girls who love anybody,"Some interesting characters and it might have been a good book had it been a little more detailed. I guess she wrote it fast or had some difficulties because the back cover and story have the characters mixed up. It's 4 friends you only hear from 3 what's up with that?A whole lot of dysfuction for all of these girls. One is dating a pimp (YUCK!) A drug dealer who turns her out, and a hustler who turns legit! It tells each individual story but as you read it isn't clear because their endings aren't revealed so you're like what in the hell is going on!Maybe in part 2 she'll tell you what happened but then wouldn't that lead to a part 3?I think that this book with more time, and better editors could be a good read, the last half does get kind of interesting."
4,Filled With Suspense,"This book was given to me by a friend who is reading the series. The book kind of caught me off guard with everyone's situation, but I couldn't stop reading. It's filled with a lot of gasping moments and the end of the book, you'll want to know what happens next! So now, I'm reading the 2nd book, Every Thug Needs a Lady. Lol."
4,"thugs:some good and some bad,but still a thug","when starting off reading this book, im not gonna lie,it was a little slow and boring to me,but as the book got over the first part with angel, i believe that it got really good. i guess i just didnt like angel's part at all. kyra and jaz have to be my favorite characters so far in this book. and ohh i am lovin faheem..what a man!! not to spoil anything but i hope jaz ends up ok and i also felt really sad about what happened with her crazy sister..glad that kyra got back on her feet and also happy that she got her boo back. all in all this was a good book and now i cant wait to read every thug needs a lady cuz i am really interested to see what happends next with these friends."
1,not what i Expected !!,This book was not what i Expected at all. It was not that interesting. I've read way better. NOT WORTH THE BUY!!!
4,Women think,The women in this book could be smart if the had some type of guidance. I enjoyed the book and I'm currently reading the sequel Payback is a Mutha.
4,A Must Read,"I was never into to these Kind of books until a lady a work gave me hers to read. This was so good I couldn't put it down. It really keeps your attenion and you can't wait to see what will happen next. Once you read the first one, You just have to read Every Thug needs A Lady."
5,WAHIDA CLARK IS THE REAL DEAL,"ONE OF THE BEST URBAN TALES. I LOVED ""THUGS AND THE WOMEN WHO LOVE THEM"" WHO DO I BEGAN WITH JAZ, ANGEL, KYRA OR BETTER YET LETS START WITH THE THUGS SNAKE, TY, MARVIN, AND FAHEEM. THESE ARE SOME CHARACTERS YOU WILL NOT FORGET. MS. CLARK HAS A WAY OF TELLING A GREAT STORY! I CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE SEQUEL."
1,Puerile Trash Full of Excuses,"This is a waste of time, paper, and ink. The only market for this book is either people who like sensationalistic trash or women who want to excuse away or glamorize bad choices and poor morals. It's a great read for people who glorify the thug culture. For people who wonder why America isn't special anymore, and why it's no longer great, they can wonder no longer - just look between the pages."
5,BIG UPS,All I have to say is if you enjoy these kind of books then you're missing out if you don't read this one I couldn't put it down fell asleep with it woke up with it and hated for it to end and what an ending You got talent my sista anxiously waiting for that sequel I'll be one of the first to get it I'm hoping you're gonna help Jasmine out I know this review doesn't really tell you anything about the book but I am an avid reader of AA fiction and take my word for it you will not be disappointed I'll put money on that If anyone has read any others like this and would like to recommend something send me an e-mail I've read all the ones before this
3,Not Bad,"This is my first ""street literature"" read and I'll admit it was better than I expected. Although I was waiting for Roz's story then the book abruptly ended. I found that odd. There were also several other missing pieces. I don't really feel like I have any closure at all. I understand it's a series, but still...the book just seems incomplete. I'll check out the next book in the series and hopefully get the missing pieces."
5,Very satisfied,I received my book and it was in gret condition. I will continue to buy my books from here.
5,Maritimes,"As the previous reviewer stated, this is a great guide for locals as well as visitors. The author combines some fine local history and stories with essential travel tips that will definitely point travellers in the right direction for an enjoyable vacation."
3,Fairly good book,"I thought this book was a good starter book on selling your home by owner, but I still have some questions so I'm going to check into a few more books."
2,lame,"this cuaderno is really lame. some of the activities are useful. most of them are very 2nd gradish--they don't make you think at all about what needs to be written, all exercises follow the same formula, you jsut substitute a different vocab word/verb. the listening comprehension (done in a language lab) is good b/c it helps you train your ear, but even some of those exercises are silly."
2,Review of Cuaderno de Actividades,"At first I was pleased with the quick shipment of the book, but am now dissatisfied with the fact that a total of 20 pages are missing from the activity book. There was nothing disclosed in the status of the book that mentioned that pages would be missing. In the future, I will only buy new workbooks."
4,Great Book,We are using this for a study guide for a small group Bible study.Having it on the Kindle makes it very easy to use.
5,Brilliant writing,CS Lewis weaves an account from an unexpected perspective that makes the message that much more interesting. His wit never ceases to amaze.
3,"Love Screwtape, hate this edition","This ""Enhanced Special Illustrated Kindle Edition"" is a huge disservice to a masterful work. The illustrations are clownish and insultingly ill-conceived. And the enhancements are presented in a format which is incompatible with even the newest Kindle Fire HD. I will be requesting a refund and buying a different edition.Screwtape is an incredibly insightful work that teaches me a great deal, and I definitely want to own it on Kindle...just not in THIS edition."
3,Great Book Not So Great Audio Book,Screwtape is a great read and I thought that it would make a great audio book to listen to in the car. Joss Ackland is however an unfortunate choice as a narrator for this work. His reading style is so dry that it makes this lively book a real chore to listen to. I imagine that John Cleese would be a much better choice to narrate this work. I just wish that his narration was still available.
3,Pictures are small.,I was expecting many nice pictures but they are mostly all of the same Two characters. But a good read at any rate.
1,no action!,"just 4 matches ,the best being the last match involving Malia Hosaka vs Lei Lani Kai which ended in a disqualifacation.The title Thunder in the Ring showed very little thunder,limited action and wrestlers who are not interesting.If you wish, select another video from World of Women's Wrestling.This one isn't all that."
1,Weak Beginning that NEVER gets better.,"This book was the slowest that I have ever read. The entire concept of the book is quite unbelievable. I never understood how the heroine, who is supposed to be so intelligent, could question herself about the crime. I mean did she NOT know?? Either she committed the crime or she didn't. And what is with a twin popping out of nowhere? This book was better suited to be marketed as a pre-teen thriller."
3,Not bad,"I thought this movie was alright. I felt that the story moved along well and I thought the ending tied in well together...I actually rented this from Blockbuster so I didn't notice the audio problems that some have mentioned. I felt that it was a pretty good flick. Some acting was a little amature, but it all moved well. Not bad for an indie movie."
3,Pleasant watch,"In watching this film, I didn't know what to expect, but it wasn't what half of these people reviewing it have said. I liked the film. I agree with the fact the the audio towards the end of the film was a little off, but overal for being an independent film, it was watchable. I understood the plot of the movie. The town deputy is trying to find what his past is like and finds a whole lot more than he expected. Watch to find out for yourselves. Give this one a chance, it was a pleasant watch."
2,"hokey, but unintentionally","The one aspect of this movie preventing it from being a Dudley Crap recipient is the fact that with a little more budget, this movie could have been a lot more credible. The low budget is so painfully obvious from moment one that it is hard to keep it out of your mind as you watch it. Rockville Slayer has a decent amount of plot and dramatic devices going for it and Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's brother) does an admirable job as the sherriff and keeps the other actors well grounded, but ultimately the film's many plot points come up feeling slight because of the budgetary constraints. The cover artwork and description lead you to believe this is just another slasher kill fest, but that is not the case. Its a decent enough mystery that in spite of its'low budget keeps you somewhat interested throughout.Rockville Slayer is certainly a cut above many other low budget trash horror on the market.Story:3.5 stars Acting: 3 stars Budget: 1 star. Overall rating: 2.25 stars"
3,Looking Forward to it,After all this fighting between the makers and some other group of guys im definitely going to buy it to see what all the fuss is about. maybe its not the intention of this fight but it might increase sales.
5,One Great Scare,"I really enjoyed this movie. This film not only provides you with a good old fastioned scare but it is also very entertaining. I didn't know what to expect when I first saw it, but totally exceeded my expectations. The plot was well developed and the acting was quite good. This is a great movie for any horror fan."
5,A Classic Horror,This movie was so scary that I had to sleep with the light on after watching it. There is nothing better than watching something that will scare you to death. I held on to my boyfriend so tight the entire movie. If you are looking for a good care than this movie is for you.
2,Decent and Good but poor sound quality keeps it from being one of the better B movies,"When buying this DVD, I thought it would be good movie to watch even if it wasn't one of the well known horror movies. Although it was good than most movies of that are out there of this caliber, but my biggest complaint was the sound quality of the movie. I like to be able to watch a movie without having to put on Closed Caption to know what's being said at points throughout the movie cause of the low volume. Other than that it was at least a 2.5 out of 5 for me, though it could've been better executed."
2,"Nice film location, but thats about it","Could have been a cool ""B"" slasher film but the story and continunity is all over the place."
1,dahhh,I would give this movie a 0 if it were my choice.A big fat 0. The reviews before me must be family or have some kind of connection! Bad bad bad the words would come out and you would see their mouths move latter.It was so stupid that I can't believe I got suckered again. Don't waste the time and don't get ripped off like I did...
3,very confusing if you don't know a lot beforehand,"I didn't know a lot about the Jewish Uprising before, or a lotabout Poland either. After reading it once, I went back to thebeginning and then understood it more. Sometimes, I would think I figured it out, but then it would do something that would go completely against it. For example, I didn't know what ""Pan"" meant. At first, I thought it was the first name of the guy. Then I thought that ""Pan"" meant Mr., but then at the end of the book, they say Mr. and not Pan. Why for some things they would have Polish, when the rest of it was in English?"
3,The Man From The Othere Side,"I am reading a book called The Man From The Other Side.To me it is a real interesting book,since its talking about smuggling things to other people.Like I said I realy liked this book and I recomend it to anybody.Cause if you like people helping out other people than u would like this book."
2,Floor Mats,"The name on the mats is for a Jeep Grand Cherokee and while the front mats fit the Commander, the rear mats do not fit the Commander."
3,no gods no masters by Immaculate fools,"The Review from Music fan from Djibouti isn't good because he doesnt knows the band. I know them from the first album HEART OF FORTUNE and I would say that the music from IF very melodic pop with irish ingrendients music is. ANOTHER MANS WOLRD or DUMB POETS are jewels. The TOY SHOP contains spanish folk touches. The unplugged album WOODHOUSE is sincereely one of the best unplugged Cd I ever heard .You must hear it all! OK, the newest is not the best, but it is a really good band. Sorry for my bad english..."
1,WHO ARE THESE GUYS!,"This is not the real Spear of Destiny group. I don't know what bunch of chumps these guys are, but half the songs on here are from the much sought-after Spear of Destiny box set. That these guys would have the cheek to try to imitate this classically divine band is insulting and degrading to their faithful and worshipful listeners."
4,Great!,"This shampoo is good but if you like thicker hair try the phytocyan. But still a good shampoo, it's the only brand I use that is compatible with my scalp any other brand gives me dandruff"
4,Regency Romance,"Off the cover: ""She was everthing a beautiful woman should be. Spirited, intelligent, and innocent. She was also without a penny. When her engagement to an Italian nobleman fell through---or, rather, was pushed through by his Uncle Aldo---Selina figured all was lost. She was certain no eligible man would offer for her now. But her guardians had a brilliant idea--make her the mistress of the Regent himself!"""
4,Timex watch review,"Great value for the money, although it's a bit of a challenge to program some of the digital functions."
2,Looks nice and works most of the time.,"The watch has the potential to be a good all around time piece; however, the needle drive mechanism is poorly made - you can see the second hand wobble. And last week the analog part of the watch decided to completely go nuts. There is a possibility this was due to strong electromagnetic influence, but the digital part was not at all affected. I wish I would've bought the Casio DW5600E-1V or GW5600J-1 instead."
1,broke,"purchased this and after 6 months it broke with normal use, the dial to adjust the time just pulled out and couldn't be used after that. Very disappointed with Timex."
4,beautiful watch!!!,"Beautiful watch with all the attractiveness of an analog watch, but all the features of a digital. A little heavy with audible ticking. Buttons a little hard to mash in, but they work. Product came exactly as featured in picture. Seller even sent extra battery! This was a gift for my husband and it looks very nice on."
4,Timex T41361,Watch works pretty good. Wish the face was white in color instead of that yellowish tone.
3,CLOCK TIMEX,THIS IS OK BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME I RECEIVED BECAUSE THE BELT IS BROWN BUT AT THE MOMENT I PURCHASE THE ITEM HAD THE BELT BLACK LIKE I WANT.
5,Great watch,"I was looking for a watch to replace another Expedition watch that I had and beat around for nearly 8 years. This watch is great looking, does what the description says, was easy to set without looking at the instructions, and has a comfortable fitting band. It is easy to read day or night, and I like that you can sync the seconds on the digital with the analog second hand."
2,Disappointing,"I really liked the design of this watch and the durable leather straps. So much so, that I put up with its inconvenient thickness for over a year.But somehow the most important button (for controlling the digital part) stopped working (not from any mishap as far as I can tell) and I cannot change or turn off the alarm. Nor can I reset the digital time. And it's not worth paying to repair, so I have stopped using it.I'd recommend purchasing a different model."
1,Arrived defective,"This watch has a beatufil finish and the best analog - digital features of any watch at any price. One of the four digital set button fell out when adjusting new. I've owned four resin Expedition watches in five years. This stainless steel version is more refined and robust, but Expedition set buttons and bezels are a weak point. I have to return it, but I do want another. It is accurate to within seconds a month."
5,The,"Coming from Rockford, IL, this band created freshly complex and melodic compositions for their stunning debut for such a young band (the average age at the time was 19). These 13 songs that document a band bursting with ideas and emotion. There is a pop feel to it but this cd is Indie Rock at it's best. Get this cd if you like good sounding post-punk with melodies, but without the whiny emo voice."
2,Sad,"My former Amco(?) USA-made Swing-A-Way can opener has served me well for most of my adult life, but I thought the cutting wheel was starting to get a little dull, so I bought what I thought was an exact replacement. Oops. This flimsy thing might possibly be competitive with other manual openers, but it is a pale shadow to my old one. You can easily bend this thing's handles sideways; a rivet keeps you from opening it up comfortably wide; and the turn knob is wobbly. You sold out, Amco, for Chinese-made junk. Guess I'll just keep using my old opener another decade or two."
1,Nearly useless.,I had one of these in the larger size but regretably lost it in a move. I found one of these on sale. Bought it. Wish I had not done so. It is difficult to get it to stay on/in the can & even harder to turn once the can does puncture. I hurt my hands on it several times & ended up pitching it. It was useless! I would not give it Any stars if I didn't have to. Save your money & get something else.
1,CRAP!,I bought this and it broke within 1 week. I think I used it three times at the most!! I would not waste your money! One of those things: You get what you pay for.
4,Panasonic PV-GS29 MiniDV Camcorder with 30x Optical Zoom,"Very small and easy to carry. Neat on the zoom, a bit hazy on the image stabilization but overall a good buy for the buck."
4,"QV7: Excellent Product, but Phone Support is always Busy","The last reviewer mentioned a lot of CD swapping. This is untrue if you load all the CD's locally to your hard drive just by selecting an option off your file menu. It's simple to do and there are directions in the help menu if you have any trouble. The only downer is it takes up hard disk space, but not too much as long as it doesn't have a lot of graphics since usually it's only text that loads into a database. Overall, I have been happy with this product, but I have had an unfortunate experience trying to subscribe to their online libraries and ordering a the Scofield NIV unlock key. Their online ordering through the software does not work for me and their 1-800 # is always busy. I would give this a five star rating, if it weren't for those two things. Otherwise being able to compare translations, open commentaries and references to the exact verse your reading with a click of a button is a priceless time saver."
1,think hard,"Mine was falling apart within a day. Also, the band is poorly shaped. I can't imagine it fitting anyone. The long cord is good but make sure you need one. Mine gets tangled because it is too long for what i need"
3,stopped working,"Three weeks after they arrived, the left side stopped working. Sound was Ok, fit was good but cannot recommend."
5,Wonderful sound,"It's nice to hear great music, played beautifully and with great skill, on an instrument such as this. I can listen to this again and again."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this book with the hope of some kind of insight, and some good stories.It's a decent book, but I could care less about John Schuerholz the poet, I bought the book for baseball.I was very disappointed, it seems like another book that is an attempt to destroy ""Moneyball"" in the book market, but fails miserably.I love the Braves, but left this book feeling pretty disappointed."
2,"A few interesting stories, but very poorly written.","Every now and then Schuerholz will offer up some inside info on different trades, almost trades (Barry Bonds nearly traded to Atlanta, for example), and free agent signings that will keep you somewhat interested. Overall, however, the book is just boring, repetitive (by chapter 6 you will hate the phrase ""evergreen clause""), poorly worded, and offers little insight on how the business of baseball works that most fans didn't already know.Schuerholz also takes a few pot shots at the ""Money Ball"" way of thinking, and uses very poor examples to support his arguments. (He uses his signing of Raul Mondesi as a argument in favor of an emphasis on scouting, then later in the chapter acknowledges that Mondesi was a complete bust and had to release him half way through the season)I enjoyed taking a closer look at a baseball front office, but they poor writing and dead-end anecdotes that Schuerholz offers up made this book a bit difficult to read."
1,"A great GM, and Schuerholz knows it","This book should have been written in the third person, or better yet, by an unbiased third party. After reading several chapters, I concluded that the book should have been entitled ""How great I am, or why I am the best GM that ever lived."" A more modest approach to reviewing his success with the Atlanta Braves would have been nice. Sorry to be so negative about this book, because I really admire Schuerholz and all he has accomplished in baseball. But a little humility would have gone a long way."
2,Built to Win: Inside Stories About How Great I Am,"This would have been a much better title for the book. Schuerholz offers little insight into what he actually does; instead, he gives vague generalities that usually serve only to remind us of how good a GM he is. Even the title is being subtly arrogant. 'Baseball's Winningest GM'...what does that even mean? Most regular season wins? Most division titles? Certainly not most World Series titles, and this is the ultimate definition of a winner.I applaud what Schuerholz has done, and this book does have some interesting anectodes about players through the years, but more often than not the book is used only for Schuerholz to toot his own horn."
1,I tried to like it!,"In this self-aggrandizing attempt to position the Braves as the most successful franchise of the past 100 years of baseball, Schuerholz offers very little insight on how to run a successful franchise and instead focuses on stories that leave you saying in the end, ""who cares.""The book at times feels like it is being written on a 4th-grade reading level and I could not in good conscious recommend it to any baseball fan."
3,Weakest of the series,"Regular readers of Sue Henry's books will doubtless want to read Beneath the Ashes, if only to keep up with the activities of the protaganist, Jessie Arnold. But be warned, this is not up to her usual standards. Like earlier books, the best thing about Ashes is the descriptions of Alaska and sled dog racing but, while the description of the process of training young dogs is interesting, on the whole there less of this type of material than usual. In her other books, Henry's typical plot device is ""spot the loonie"", that is, figure out which of these seemingly normal people is actually a homicidal nut case. She has real problems figuring out how to deal with the situation in this book where the question is: ""which of these nut cases is the killer?"" As a result, by the time all is revealed you really don't care very much."
3,Not one of her best,"I've read many of Sue Henry's books and enjoyed most of them (they've also have turned me into an Iditarod and Yukon Quest fan). But this one is not up to her usual standards. Not only don't you care for any of the characters, but the denouement is so convoluted and implausible that I was left thinking ""HUH????""I feel rather disloyal saying all this, since she's one of my favorite authors, but I wouldn't want anyone reading this and judging her series by this one volume. Try ""Murder on the Iditarod Trail,"" ""Murder on the Yukon Quest,"" or ""Termination Dust"" (one of my favorites) before giving up on her."
3,MORE FRIGID ADVENTURES,"Sue Henry's Jessie Arnold series is wonderful in evincing a feel of the Alaskan wilderness and life in the ""slow"" lane. Unfortunately, Henry's books while generally entertaining are a little too laid back in their delivery, and Arnold comes across as a less effective heroine than she should be. In BENEATH THE ASHES, Arnold is approached by an old acquaintance to help her dig up something in a cabin where she lived ten years prior, having Arnold as her neighbor. We immediately dislike this friend, Anne, and it isn't too long before several arsons immerse Jessie in a complex plot in which she becomes a main suspect. Henry isn't a master of suspenseful plotting, but her images of the wilderness and her love for the sledding life is evidenced and entertaining."
3,Not the same without Alex Jenson,"Sue Henry's characters had a grip on me and it's always interesting to see where relationships are headed. Why is it that book characters, as well as TV characters, can't have and maintain loving relationships? It's just not as much fun without Alex Jenson in Jesse Arnold's life. Especially useful are Henry's tidbits about sled dog training (does everyone who reads this series find more books about the Iditarod?) but there should be more to it than that. This one fell a little flat--stilil worth the price of admission but I might wait for a few reviews before attempting the next."
3,"Fun, Fast, Read","If you like dogs, and you like easy, uncomplicated mysteries, and you like strong, single, capable female heroines, you'll like this book. I did--very much. It's my first introduction to Sue Henry's ""Alaska Mystery"" series, and it certainly won't be the last.Light on improbable plot but strong on descriptive details (really interesting information on how to mush a dog team, which I found captivating), the story concerns a series of arsons that come to involve heroine Jessie, her cabin, and her good name among her compatriots in the Alaska town in which she lives. It all centers on a former friend named Anne, whom Jessie picks up at the airport, only to regret the reunion the minute they meet.I found the denoument so confusing that I'm still not sure who did what to whom, but nevertheless, I found the whole reading experience lots of fun--enough to want to try more Sue Henry."
2,Who set which fires??,"I've never read a Sue Henry book before. I liked the Alaskan setting, but the rest of the book was totally uninteresting. And confusing. At the end, when the confessions came cascading, I was lost. ""Well, I set this fire, and then he set that fire, because he knew I would, so he beat me to it, and then that guy set another fire because he was mad about a fire I set way back when..."" What? I didn't even try and make sense of it."
3,mediocre,"I agree with a lot of the other reviews that this book was not up to Sue Henry's standards. Generally I enjoy reading about the dogs and the musher's life, and I did as well in this book. However the story was implausible and I felt the ending was very weak. Almost as if the author just wanted to finish the book and did not really think it out logically."
4,Fast Paced Enjoyable Mystery,"Jessie Arnold, musher extraordinaire, is happily training her young Husky pups as spring approaches. She then hears from a neighbor of hers from ten years ago who is coming back to Alaska and needs her help. Then an arsonist strikes a local hangout. Jessie's cabin is the next target. Connections to her neighbor's past are revealed and Jessie is soon in fear for her life without knowing who she can trust to help her. Jessie Arnold is one of my favorite characters. She is strong, smart and capable. This is a well written, fast paced mystery with a good plot and interesting characters. My favorite parts of a Henry novel always involve Jessie's interaction with her dogs and there was plenty of that in this story...it's almost like being there in the middle of the pack! A very good read."
2,Nice try,"You always hope for new filmmakers and there are few movies about chess. There are periodic moments when we get a sense of the chess world, and a re-creation of Fischer's family and childhood is interesting and provocative. Nonetheless the movie misses on various levels.There's enough creativity and desire in this filmmaker that you want him to get better and make a new movie that is successful."
5,"Beautiful volume, amazing novellas!","Not being a huge science fiction fan, I bought this volume hoping to enjoy the stories here. I was not disappointment! H.G. Wells wrote with confidence, imagination and depth, which surprised me I guess. The high literary tone of the prose makes for an amazing yet accessible read and the stories themselves are much more allegorical and profound than I had anticipated. Wells makes comments on humanity and society that cause the reader to think about the implications of his messages. ""War of the Worlds"", for example, is much more than Aliens vs. Mankind. Highly recommended!"

2,Paperlace as of late,This album is a compilation of rerecoreded hits by the band done fairly late in thier career. It does not have the same energy as the original songs released 30 years ago.
3,fraggle friends,"this is a childrens storybook, a Fraggle Rock book about friends Mokey and Red Fraggle and there adventures getting Mokey a new brushplant in a scary cave. Good for ages up to 8.3.5 stars"
2,Shuffleboard Lover but this set is not worth the money,"In 2007 I ordered a Champion Sports Shuffleboard set and the cues had bent and we needed to update. Ordered this set thinking it was simply different colored disks but the disks are not made of the quality our set was that we ordered in 2007. The disks in this set are plastic and too light for the outdoor use that we bought them for. I am disappointed and would not recommend this to any shuffleboard players, not even beginners because you will not get the enjoyment out of the game that you could if you started with a decent set that will last for many years."
5,Fulton MX-991\U,"The MX-991\U is a marvel of gadgetry from a time when gadgets were actually useful. The thing is a pretty rock-solid tube, which has a couple of integral compartments for holding a spare bulb and colored lens filters (see customer image). It has a low-tech, multi-mode switch which is hard to work, but functions properly. It's got a very sturdy metal pocket clip which, coupled with the 90 degree head, allows hands-free use. Best of all, the light is wired in such a way that it doesn't drain the batteries at all when not in operation.I bought one of these at a surplus store about twenty years ago. I really abused the light for fifteen years or so before I managed to crack the threading on the bottom though a combination of severe cold and a smack on the concrete. It still works, but it's not watertight anymore.You'll be hard pressed to find a better light at the $13 price point."
4,Exactly the same brand as my old military flashlight!,"Received flashlight on the date promised. It is exactly the same flashlight I had for over 20 years. The only problem is that it is missing the rubber gasket (O-ring) that is at the head of the flashlight to protect it from water damage. No contact number to talk with service rep from the company to get that gasket. Contacted Amazon, very helpful, will credit back $5.00 for missing item. Great service."
4,Ok for average usage,It was an ok buy and served its purpose. Perhaps if there's one with an LED Bulb it would be a superb pocket torch.
4,Anglehead flashlight,"Solidly built, it's the standard anglehead torch. different lenses in the base, sturdy switch, nice lanyard ring on the bottom and steel clip at the back."
5,Highly Recommended,This flashlight is exactly as described and shown on the site. It is very sturdy and well made. The switch on mine was not stiff. It is a very solid product and I use it all the time. Highly recommended.
5,Great Buy!,Product is made in the USA!This is exactly what I was looking for! Flashlight is not a toy like the cheaper brands. Very happy with my purchase and thinking about buying another one.
4,Good for the money,"Good flashlight, comes with standard red and blue lens hidden under the battery compartment. Appears pretty rugged. Great for Hiking and camping."
5,Colorful & Idea Filled,"The book shows a good variety of theme and specialty scrapbooks suitable for gift giving. Techniques include mini-albums, flip calendars, and other novel ways to document an event or honor an individual. Being new to scrapbooking, some of the instructions were too brief for me and didn't always clarify terms or show detailed enough examples.Still there are plenty of ideas to be gained. Each page shows two or three colorful album pages."
1,Books on Change,"As a change advocate, I find the works in this book to be not much more than dry prose. The advice given does not really make much sense and the examples do not fit the context. The latter feels somewhat like madeup stories. If a reader wants to learn about change, Kotter or Conner do a fine job."
2,"Original artists, but not all studio recordings","Be warned, while this is a nice selection of new wave club hits from the 80s, many, if not most, of the tracks are not the original recordings. They ARE the original artists, but many are ripped from live recordings. I hate when I get one of these home and it's not really like the track I grew up listening to."
1,They break,"Don't buy these. I bought two pair, and both of them broke. I am not rough with them -- just sitting at the computer listening to music."
5,Works Great,"This gasket has a peel off sticky surface on one side to help with the seal. So far so good, no leaks and no problems with the overall quality."
5,Loved it!!!!!,A great read! I loved the format and insights. Wonderful for Lent or Advent or well anytime. I never realized there were so many 'silent witnesses' and how I can relate to them so well.
4,Not bad.....,"I LOVE these headphones, for me the sound Quality was great and they got pretty loud w/out gettings distortions, and the pain, i guess is based on the individual.....My ears only hurt after wearing them for more than 1-2 hours straight......i've had them for about 3-5 years(cant remember) and the Right headphone is now going bad.....(well, i also used them ALOT..)well, for the $5 i spent on them, they were awesome and am very glad that they still actually have them....."
3,"Horrible sound, and design","Having to use this headphones for over a month, the sound quality is horrible. But considering the price... This proves, you get what you pay for.The headphones are not the easiest to place over your ears for quick listening, etc. It took me a while before I figured the best way on installing them on your ears.There are no pressure to ""squeeze"" the headphones against your ears, thus the poor quality. I would apply light pressure to each headphone and noticed the sound quality to be better. Without the headband to ""squeeze"" the headphones against your ear, you won't get the best sound quality. I would suggest on purchasing a better set of headphones."
5,Very informative!,"Speaking as someone that is trying to get a better grip on PDD, this book has to be one of the most comprehensive that I have read as of yet. My friend has a child with PDD and I am on a journey to find out as much information as I can. The more knowledge that I acquire, the more support I feel that I can give to my friend and her son. This book equips you with a wide range of topics such as: medications, therapies, and educational techniques so that it enables you to make educated choices when it comes to treatment and intervention."
2,The Hot Rod Resurrection Infommercial,"This could have been so much better, Mr. Yates seems more interested in name dropping and promoting his Eliminator Enterprises LLC project. With such a historic automobile as the Eliminator, more time could have been spent on the car and its workings. More detailed photographs of the restoration and bones of car."
2,Two out of Three ain't bad... kind of.,I just received my order for El Guapo corn husks. Two of the 6oz packages were fine. The third was moldy and no good.
3,libro de modismos y palabras coloquiales aleman español,me interesaria adquirrir su libro ya que actualment estoy llevando un curso de aleman y em interesaria ampliar mi acervo como mi pronunciacion sobre todo un adquisison actulaizada de sus tema s asimcomo la manera de entrar a su sociedada gracias
4,Whew!,"Talk about one heck of a workout. This has 8 different workouts all abour 8-9 minutes. No warm up. A slight cool down/stretch. 3 regular intensity workouts, 3 challenging workouts, 1 ball workout, and 1 weight/ring workout - all for your abs. You feel the burn right away. Setting is not interesting - but you wont look at it much if you are focusing on the movements. The instructor does not have the best technique..."
2,Yuck,"I am not a fan of this DVD at all! The music makes you feel like you're about to walk into h#ll, and the instructor sounds like she's been inhaling helium. It's crunch, crunch, crunch with little variation. 8 minutes into it, I literally wanted to throw up, and I never get like that exercising. Someone mentioned her little evil eye when she looks at the camera, and that's exactly what it is!lol I tried this a few times, but it's just not varied enough, and I hate the sick feeling. Just lay down, do 200 crunches and save $14."
3,Not enough oblique exercises,"I'm in above-average shape, but I wouldn't say extraordinarily fit or anything, and I found the ""challenging"" work-outs to be fairly easy. My abs are always sore the next, though, so it must be doing something!I also like the instructor. She's very no-nonsense and doesn't waste time explaining things a million times (maybe that is just because I only do the challenging work-outs).My one complaint is that there is not much exercise for the obliques. So I recommend alternating these with Billy Blanks Tae-Bo Ab Bootcamp, which is mostly waist/oblique exercises. Seriously, that DVD got my obliques rock hard!"
4,"Excellent, but not for beginners","This DVD gives its money's worth, but I would not recommend it to a beginner. I purchased this DVD after I read a review from a mom who is trying to get back in shape after the baby. The only problem I find with this program is that it is hurting my neck and upper back. I was doing it 3 times a week and I have been regularly doing it for four weeks now and saw a significant change happening to my flabby abs. When I should actually be jumping for joy I am unable to do so as I have a nagging ""pressure"" feeling in my neck and upper back. So I have stopped doing the abs for now. I guess it would help to build some muscle in the upper back and the shoulder area first before someone launches on this intense abs workout."
5,All About Abs,"There's no fluff here, just back to basics ab work. Every kind of crunch you can imagine to target every part of your abs. If you want a real belly buster this is the DVD you're looking for. I got this one with Perfect Core by the same instructor. If you want some ab/core work with a Pilates feel then check out Perfect Core."
4,Good Abs Workout for Beginners,"My mother and I use this video about 4 times a week. Each time we come away feeling as if the exercise was worthwhile. Though sometimes hard on the back, it was well worth the price I paid."
5,Perfect Abs is Perfect,"This is a great DVD. It's the abs DVD I've been looking for for the past year and a half. I love how it has all the different workouts.I just had a baby 7 weeks ago and the 3 beginning workouts are challenging, but doable. I can't wait to do the advanced workouts to get back to where I was pre-pregnancy.I like how it just gets right to the workouts, no beating around the bush, so you can get it done quickly.There are 8 different workouts on here. 3 8-9 minute beginner, 3 8-9 minute advanced, and two bonus workouts, one Pilates inspired and the other with a hand weight. You just can't get bored with this DVD.I highly recommend it!"
3,basic but pretty good,"This is a no-frills DVD as far as production, but that means there is very little wasted chatter time. There are 3 beginner segments and 3 advanced segments. I don't see all that much difference between them. The woman's voice is a bit annoying (I use this with a group of 18 year old girls, who are very critical and easily annoyed....) but I imagine it is hard to talk while doing sit ups. My abs are in very good shape and most ab DVDs are disappointing and not challenging enough. There are a couple segments on here that give a good ab workout. There could be more for obliques and lower abs, but it's a good starting point and will help to sculpt stronger, firmer abs."
5,Where Have They Been,"This DVD rocks, what more can I say, what a great collection and series of AB workouts. I was looking for a DVD that could simulate my abs classes at the gym and this one is perfect. Lots of routines and exercises variations. Highly recommend."
3,Okay workout,"This DVD was just alright. Some of the reviews mentioned the instructor was annoying - I didnt find her particularly annoying. I thought that she did a good job and some of the workouts were pretty good. There are other DVDs that I think are better. Try cardio Balance Ball with Tanja Djelevic. This is a great all-around workout. It will target your abs, but also your entire body."
5,"Quick, concise, you'll stick with this.","6 exercises with 2 ""bonus"" Pilates inspired ones.3 Beginner Types3 Challenging TypesAll 8-10 minutes long, the perfect length to keep in the dvd player and every once in a while do one real quick. If you need more, do another exercise. Since they're three different types, it helps mix up the exercises so you don't get bored.I highly recommend this, the perfect amount, and if you follow along and do them as she does you really feel it, even after 8 minutes."
4,Perfect Abs DVD,This is a pretty decent DVD with a wide varity of workouts to choose from. One thing I did not like was the form the instructor used while performing the crunches. Many of us are taught not to pull on our neck while doing crunches yet she did it each time. If I was new to doing crunches and used her form I could hurt myself but luckly I am a seasoned vet to working out. I love to challenge myself with the latest workout trends. Overall I give this DVD 4 stars because my abs are in pain when I'm finished each time without fail. Great Workout DVD!
5,Intense Workout -Totally Worthit,"I'm not a novice to exercise, but am a bit outta shape since Katrine. This video goes right to the workout, it doesn't waist time on repetative warmups like some, and you definitely feel your effort the next day. I love it, and I'm really picky. Great ab workout!"
3,"Annoying instructor, good workout","This video is meant to be a supplement to other workouts. There is no warm-up. You chose one of the 6 ab workouts and as soon as you hit play, there is the instructor on the floor ready to begin. The recorded volume of this video must be very loud, as I always have to jump up and turn it down. The instructor is very good, but her voice drives me nuts! I use one or two parts of this video every day as a supplement to other videos with just a few abdominal exercises. Love the workout, don't much care for the instructors voice!"
1,"Abs Drills are Bad Enough, No Need to Add Additional Annoyance","I replaced a worn out copy of The Firm's 5-Day Abs recently, and at the same time purchased this DVD. Oh my goodness, is it annoying! Her voice is piercing and squeaky. Her cuing banal and without focus on form. The producers didn't even have the good sense to vary the music across the supposedly ""8 different routines"". At best, this is five routines. Really, just three. Folks, go find a copy of The Firms 5-Day Abs. Yes, it has been around for a long time, and the producers failed to break down the segments into individual chapters, but the work outs are very effective and well cued, target the entire abdominal muscle structure, the music and instructors are varied, and it costs less."
3,No so impressed...,"I'm not as impressed as many other reviewers. There is no introduction whatsoever; you don't even know who this person is or see her standing up to assess the state of her core. She starts off at least six of the routines with the same first set of crunches, and a few times I thought perhaps I had chosen the prior routine by mistake. There aren't any new or particularly innovative moves here at all, and there are way too many of the same crunch moves with tiny variations from one routine to the next. You can really hardly tell them apart. The annoyance factor is kind of high: Either she wasn't mic'd properly, or her voice is simply not suited to this kind of thing, and it's not like there aren't plenty of other trainers who are able to work out and call the moves without creaking and croaking. I bought it based on the high reviews, but I really don't see the attraction."
5,No Complaints,I'm having a great time with this DVD. I've been using it for a couple of weeks and I'm getting great results. i would definitely recommend adding this to your exercise routine.
5,No-nonsense ab workouts for intermediates,"I really enjoy this DVD because there are six 8-9 minute ab workouts. I really felt it working my core while doing the exercise and I'm already in pretty good shape. The instructor is not annoying at all. Some folks find her voice annoying because it's rather high pitched but definitely not in this DVD, she has mellow voice in all the ab segments. I particulary like the music and I her personality. The set is simple which is better than a distracting set. All in all, this DVD gets a 5."
1,Antiques Sure Are Expensive,"What is this the antique road show. I can imagine the person bringing this dinosaur into the show to be evaluated. Then the appraiser says that it is worth 399 dollars! The owner goes wild, and says that they thought it wasn't worth more than brand new ones with much better technology!!! What are you people thinking trying to sell this thing for this much. It's not even worth ten dollars."
2,Did I read the same book?,"1.5 stars. This story did absolutely nothing for me. Yes, yes, the sex scenes were over the top, but the only one with any character developement was Marissa. Beau, in my humble opinion, was way too typical of the kind of man portrayed in HQ books. ""Let me teach you about your sexuality.""-? Beau wants to teach her how to have fun--but when we first meet Beau-he isn't all that happy. So how can he teach anything?The premise of a sex video game for people with dyfunctional sex lives--sounds like porn to me. Really--what's in a video game that isn't in porn? Role playing-check. Food--check. Lame dialogue-double check.The only thing I wished could have been expanded on was Marissa confrontation with her father. I would've like to see him see the error of his ways--but whatever."
2,Intriguing and imaginative plot--unfortunate style.,"The writer takes the many details of end-times biblical prophecy and compresses them into a compelling individual journey. The story raises intriguing ideas and unique notions that offer much food for thought. On the other hand, the writing style is heavily descriptive and narrative. Occasionally, the dialogue improves the plodding pace, but sometimes even it becomes mere speach-making--a device to communicate the author's viewpoint on a particular issue. At one point the writer describes a character as being a ""road scholar."" My sense is the error was no typo. The bottom-line is that this tome offers a potentially imaginative plot--but a sophomoric writing style (with apologies to gifted tenth-graders everywhere)."
1,"Terrific Soap, Sorry Vendor","This is a great soap that more people should discover... unfortunately this Amazon third party vendor feels their MWF is worth about $20 more than the normal market price of $35. Go to West Coast Shaving, Lee's Razors or Bull Goose Shaving, save $20 and discover this amazing soap for yourself!"
4,"Great at sea level, good at high altitude","Bought this as part of a number of shaving soaps I wanted to try. Was very impressed with it while I was staying in NYC. Even with the hard water there the lather was thick and smooth. After a shave my skin feels very soft.Once back in Colorado, however, the lather is not as thick. It is good, but nothing like it was at sea level. Still quite useable and the softness of my skin afterwards is the same."
2,labtec curve-460 headphones,"played good, comfortable, and cheap price. But the wire casing frayed and came off exposing the wires whcih were ruined and the heaphones were junk."
5,Excellent Book,"A great book to read to realize just how all religions barrow things from other religions. This book, if read with an open mind, can make you see how childish some beliefs are, and how all religions some how almost 'want' to bring on the end of the world, so their savior can come.--Paul"
1,New Age Baloney,"I ordered this book because it looked interesting, but am returning it because it is so poorly written and researched. This is a ""he said, she said"" book with no apparent research. Do not waste your money!"
1,Misinformed,"This book reads as though it were written like Mr. Percy Grunt. The information is shoddy and poorly researched. The writing sucks. The book is overpriced. The writing is underskilled Hello, Mr. Author, it's high time to go back to school and learn how to craft a piece of writing. DO NOT buy this book."
5,A Trivia Game For Everyone,"I play a lot of games. A few of them fall under the ""party"" category. And Wits & Wagers is the best of them!When trivia games come off the shelf, half the people are up to the challenge while the other half groan. This game is perfect for both groups. One gets to test their general knowlege on some impossibly hard questions while the other enjoys the bluffing and betting that comes along with selecting the best answer. This is ""The Price is Right"" meets ""Trivial Pursuit"" with everyone having a blast.With 600 questions, the game holds up to repeated plays. We play this game a lot, with a lot of different people. We enjoyed it so much that we made it part of our wedding reception where each table played in their own game. Everyone went away wanting more!I highly recommend this game for any gatehring. You'll be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn't like this game."
4,"Great for parties, but game has one huge problem","I have the edition in which payout tables are 2-1 to 5-1, and after a few rounds the chip totals can get ridiculously high. There are no betting limits, so after 3-4 rounds you'll need to get your calculator out and start issueing IOU cards as the chips will run out. The creators say that hundred of people sample the game before it is issued, and its puzzling why this problem didn't come up again and again, as we ran out of chips practically every game we played. It's not that we are so brilliant as players, but with the odds on the board it pays to be aggressive, and if you hit 3 straight 4-1 answers you turn 2 chips into 128 chips after just 3 rounds.To improve the game they should put limits on bet sizes until the final round, so more time is spent answering questions rather than chip counting and distribution."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"I really looked forward to this game. I had played the children's version with my grandkids and loved it. My family loves to play games together and we're always on the lookout for a new one. However, this game disappointed all of us. Sure you don't have to know the answers necessarily, but so many of the questions made us make wild guesses that weren't based on any real knowledge. I'm usually really good at trivia games, and hated that I had to guess constantly and have no idea if I was really close. If that sounds appealing to you, then you'll like this game. Otherwise, stick to the kid's version, it's actually challenging too and is lots of fun."
4,Good family fun!,"I gave this game as a Christmas present to the family. We are all adults, but older kids could play too. It was a lot of fun as you don't have to be really smart. There is some strategy too. Doesn't take a lot of time for each game. We played two rounds. everyone enjoyed it."
4,Fun Fun Fun.,Fun and educational for children and adults combined. Everyone has a chance to be right even when you are wrong! Game moves quickly!
5,Hard but fun. Great fun with teams,Hard but fun. Great fun with teams. Remember adults can wager real dollars. That certainly ratchets up the excitement and noise
4,fun for all,This game was fun to play for CHristmas with the family. Did not take too intense learning which some like and did not last too long.
5,So much fun!,I am in my late 20s and I LOVE this game. Everyone can play and it is very interactive. Great for groups of 4 or more people. Great for parties!
3,Not for everyone,"Recently broke this out at a party. About half the guests enjoyed it, and half drifted away in apathy. Some people just don't LIKE making estimates, over and over again."
5,Best Trivia Game I've Played,"Wits & Wagers is hands down the best trivia game I've played. My friends and family spent years playing Trivial Pursuit games, Tribond, Scene It, Oodles, Split Second, even Smarty Party (32 best game), but once we found Wits & Wagers the rest just collect dust. The clever twist that allows anyone to score after guessing what they think the answer is, is pure genius! Accessible to any age over 7 and up past 100. If you like trivia games and you don't own this, add it to your cart now!"
5,Every Family Should Own This Game,"This is a game that is easy to learn and great for families and parties. It is a trivia game, but that description does not do it justice. The betting element in the game takes the amount of fun of a normal trivia game and multiplies it by 100. Even if you don't know the answer, you can still do well if you can guess who does know the answer. This opens up lots of interesting possibilities for strategy, such as bluffing, playing the odds, seeing how well you know your opponents, etc. I am not exaggerating when I say that every family should own this game. It is by far the best trivia game I have ever played, and one of the best party games I have ever played. Also, the makers of the game have great customer service. Hey, are you still reading this? Buy it already!"
2,Bad version of Trivial Pursuit,"Was all excited about this game, brought it out to play withfamily and friends.Directions of game took too long to explain AND the types of questions wereridiculous.Questions that you would never know even if you were a scholar in history.I think it has potential, but we didnt have the patience and I havent gone back to the game totry again with a smaller group. So maybe it is better than initial try"
4,Fun Game,This is a fun game. We've only played it once so far. We enjoyed all the trivia questions. We would recommend this game to others.
4,Lots of fun - better with larger groups.,"Really enjoyed the concept of this game.It s differently one of those games that is better with more people. Played a few with only 3 and was not as much fun. Really enjoyed the use of chips to track score - made it feel much more ""real"" has you had the stack in front of you vs. on some piece of paper.My only real complaint is that many of the questions are very odd and/or boring. Other wise super fun!"
1,How is this rated so highly??,This game is the most boring party game I have ever played. You just have to take a wild guess for most of the questions. The betting is less fun than I thought it would be- you just pick whichever guess you think is closest. Spend your money on a better board game.
4,Difference b/t collectible and new,I bought a 'collectible' version of this game assuming that meant 'used'. Upon arrival I discovered that 'collectible' means the previous version (I think it was made in 2001 or 02). The game works fine but it is a fact based game and some of the questions are out dated such as the question about 'how much coffee people consumed between 1998 & 2000'. There are still questions that are relevant but some questions are a little dated. Don't buy 'collectible' save money there is a difference.
4,Christmas gift Wits & Wagers,"My adult daughter requested this for Christmas. It looked like a fun party game. However, we found that the directions for playing are very complicated. So we ended up just asking each other the questions. You mostly guess the answers, which turns out to be funny and fun."
1,WITS AND WAGERS,"I WENT EVERWHERE TO FIND THIS GAME. THERE WAS SO MUCH HYPE OVER THIS GAME BY A CERTAIN RADIO STATION. TRUST ME WHEN I SAY , IT IS CRAP. PLAYED IT ONE TIME WITH THE FAMILY AND NEVER AGAIN. I REALIZE IT WAS A BIG SCAM TO GET PEOPLE TO BUY IT. I'D GIVE ANYTHING TO KNOW WHO ALL THE OWNERS ARE OF THIS PILE OF CRAP."
3,"Bought based on game reviews, disappointed","I buy a few games each year that we can play with friends when we get together, after reading reviews this was one that I chose to buy and take with us out of town. The group of 7 of us got down to it after a night out and the general feeling of the group was ""meh"". It isn't the WORST game, but it certainly isn't the best game we've ever played. I will probably try to play again with a different group and see how everyone feels about it but I have a feeling this game will not be seeing a lot of play. Not sure why everyone is so gaga about this game but for each his own I suppose."
2,Boring Game,"I bought this game after hearing about it on Dave Ramsay. My family played it once and never again. It just wasn't fun. Actually, quite boring."
5,fun game,"This is a fun game for adults and kids, learn and have fun at the same time. Very fast game, play over and over."
5,Great game,I am a board game fanatic and I love this game. It lasts the perfect amount of time and incorporates trivia with betting - but you don't have to be great at either to have fun.
5,fun game,"We took this game with us to our family vacation at the beach and enjoyed it tremendously. All were young or mature adults who played. More challenging and fun than Trivial Pursuit. Everyone agreed they'd like to play it again at our next get together. I heard about Wits and Wagers in the alumnae magazine of St Johns College, where my son went to school."
5,Great Family Game!,My family has loved this game. It's so fun to take to parties or large family gatherings. It appeals to everyone.
4,Gift,"Favorite family game. Purchased as gift for a family member so the can play with their friends, Third purchase of this game."
4,Fun,"It is a pretty fun game. If you like trivia but you aren't any good at it, that is okay, you can still win at this game."
5,Love it!!,"We love this game for our family/friends...old and young. We've played it with our 7 year old son and 60 year old grandpa, all at the same time, and we all have a great time playing together and laughing. Great learning tool, even if it is random information you won't ""technically"" need in life. Teaches estimating, guesstimating, and then learning from your mistakes by taking in all the information and betting on someone else's answer instead.Tons of laughs from the crazy questions, as well as your ridiculous answers."
5,"Great, Unique Game!! Not your typical trivia game!",My husband and I frequently get together with a group of friends for game night. We started getting tired of our old games and most of them were trivia-related and they begin to get monotonous. I purchased this on a whim and it has ended up being our favorite!!! Its great because you don't need to be good at random trivia or mentally sharp (at midnight... which is common for us)... haha... you just need to be savvy with how you place your bets! I also brought it to a church youth get-together and we had a large group playing and the teenagers LOVED it! One of the chaperones went out and purchased it for her family that week. I highly recommend!
5,Great party game for everyone!,"I bought this game for my trivia-expert husband and we love it! We've played it with 4-12 people from ages 12-75 and it's perfect for those who are trivia buffs and those who aren't. The nice thing is that generally in games like Trivial Pursuit a few people who are very trivia savvy run away with the game, but Wits and Wagers isn't that way. Some general knowledge helps, but there are plenty of opportunities for those who are clueless to come up with a win. Fun for everyone! Great for families, small gatherings, large gatherings. This is the best game we've purchased and played in a long time..."
5,Great Game!!!,Its been a long time since we've played a game that makes you want to play more! When we have people over to play Wits & Wagers we always have a good time and quit only when its too late to contnue. We recommend this game to anyone. It is lots of fun.
4,A lot of fun,"This is fun game while friends are over and you are standing around a kitchen. Bet for real money in small pots makes it fun and interesting. It is not about knowing the answers, it is about knowing who will."
3,Art & Architecture of Cambodia (World of Art),It gives you a vague idea of the Cambodian Art & Arquitecture.
4,Engaging,It has an interesting approach to perspective from other books I'd seen before. A good source for teaching my son.
5,I really improved a drawing using techniques from this book,"I was trying to draw a picture of a building with an extended cover over the driveway from a kind of different point of view and this book really helped me out. Good, understandable info on perspective drawing."
4,Perspective Drawing Handbook,"Detailed Perspective drawing instruction book.A great thing for the Professional, but a difficultHell for the Amateur who is trying to get a grip onthe problem. It looks more like a Blueprint thananything else. I am saying that this looks soprofessional drawn for professionals that anamateur will have problems trying to handle thedrawing. I cannot recommend this for an amateur.Only for another professional who already knowswhat he is doing. It is, a complicated book.----Luisa Felix, FelixHoboken@aol.com"
2,Older text - at times difficult to read,"Too much text, not enough drawing. I much prefer Perspective: space and designby Louise Bowen Ballinger"
1,Just plain wrong,Please don't buy this inaccurate text. It has at least one major flaw. The author incorrectly claims that the horizon is always at eye level. It's easy to see that's false. Walk into the Grand Canyon and you'll notice that the horizon is well above eye level.
3,what maps work,before anyone orders solus pro program they need to read about it and see what delorme maps will work with it after it is install into your pda. all of their maps does not have zoom support
3,Shipping Ruined This Item,This item was not packed to protect it from damage. It was received damp with the corner bent almost in half.
2,"Excellent service, wrong product","I searched for a Truffle Shuffle shirt, but what I had in mind was a black shirt with a green emblem. I saw the image I was looking for, ordered the correct size, but once the screen refreshed, telling me what I had just ordered, it was the heather grey version. Sure enough, when the product I ordered showed up, it was the heather grey shirt and not the black I had wanted.The shipping was extremely fast, and the return process was easy (though I was not reimbursed for the initial shipping, or return shipping). My only issue is the image showing on the order page is a different shirt then the one they are selling. Even when I received the email asking me to review this order, it showed the black shirt, but when I clicked on the link, it changed to the grey shirt. Fix your images so there is no confusion!"
3,"Some helpful parts, but mostly common sense","While this book has an admittedly limited audience, Cetuk offers a fairly thorough guide here for prospective seminary students. While much of the issues contained are probably things most people have thought through, there are some helpful suggestions. If you are entering seminary soon or considering applying, it will be worth your time to skim this book and find the parts most relevant to you and your situation. Recommended with the disclaimer that most readers will likely only glean something from one or two sections."
3,A hollow defense against seminary criticism,"As an entering seminarian I was hoping for real advice and insight into the seminary experience. This book was poorly written ad read like a defense against criticism of seminary education. The audience was not entering seminarians in my opinion. In fact, this read more like a doctoral thesis. I bought this book used and still feel that I was ripped off. It offered nothing new or unusual. What a dissapointment."
2,Not Engrossing,"I didn't actively dislike this book, but I came close. As another reviewer noted, the characters all seemed one-dimensional and silly, and the mystery, such as it was, wasn't all that puzzling.What made this a less than average mystery was the way Theo went about unraveling the mystery. She puts forth ideas that at best could be called unlikely (and at worst ridiculous), and no one calls her on it. Everyone she talks to seems to agree with her, even when she's putting forth something that is at base a physical impossibility.I really enjoyed the first two in this series and had high expectations for this one. I was disappointed."
3,Okay Mystery - DO NOT follow every recipe!,"Before I review:RAISINS ARE TOXIC TO DOGS.For this reason, one paragraph in the story should be edited out! The author suggests making a kibble for her dog using raisins. And yes, grapes are bad, too. If you question me, google it.-----I found the lengthy descriptions of tea parties, settings, and preparations dull. However, since they seem to have been inserted after the outline of the actual mystery was completed and added no important information for solving the mystery, they were easy to skim through.I rather enjoyed the actual mystery."
4,Tea & Murder!,I really enjoy Laura Child's writing style. Enough detail to paint the scene but no overkill. Like the settings. Mysteries are believable and keep you guessing. A quick read and enjoyable. Prefer her tea novels to the scrapbooking novels.
4,Shades of Earl Grey part of the Tea Mysteries,"This a part of the Tea Mysteries by Laura Childs. It helps iif one reads the earlier books, but this will stand alone. The descriptions of charlestown, South Carolina and iit's poeple are priceless. The heroine and her staff of two couldn't be better. The information about the many teas is interesting and the included recipies are wonderful."
4,Another good one,Laura Childs does not disappoint. I enjoy the characters.She always adds a bit of local color and you can almost visualize the locale.
4,light and entertaining,"It is easy to get involved in the lives of the characters, and there is always enough of a twist in the tale to keep the reader interested.Light mystery - fun to read."
4,Great for Naturals,"This gel really helps define my curls, and makes it so much easier for me to pull my `fro back and style the way I want to. It does not flake or get hard, stays soft to the touch and keeps a good hold. I recommend this gel."
5,great for wash-n-go's,"I have natural 34/a-b hair and I prefer this gel to the eco-styler. I used this as a multipurpose gel. For twisted updos, I layer products in my hair: leave-in, Shea butter, water spritz (contains glycerin) and finally the gel. My updo will last for about two weeks. I oil my scalp and lightly mist my hair with the spritz a few times during the 2 weeks. I can unravel my twist and my hair is shiny and moisturized. Also I can rock a twist out for a few more days. For wash-n-go's and free flowing twist, I mix everything in a jar. I have a heavy hand when I'm applying products because of this I have yet to master the application of KCCC in my hair. So i used Fantasia IC gel as an alternative. In a jar, I mix a leave-in, cd's hair milk and grapeseed oil and the gel. I used the shingling method for application. With this mixture, I avoid the white film and crunchy feeling that is often caused by too much product. I'm able to last one week with a co-wash or two in between."
5,Excellent graphic novel,"I picked up one of these books at our local library and fell in love with the story. After purchasing the complete set, I am glad I went into the library that day."
4,Really Great,"After just recently reading Habibi by Thompson, I've been in the search for something similar and this definitely hit the mark. At turns funny, heartbreaking, poignant and exhilirating this graphic novel is sure to please those looking for a little meat on their ""comic books"". Highly recommended and very much looking forward to reading the next in the series."
4,Correction on page count,"I just got this book today and just want to point out that this book has 400 pages, not 256 pages as amazon states."
4,"Dedicated, Iconoclastic, and Provocative Narrative","We've been reading the eight volumes from beginning to end in our Tezuka fever. Buddha certainly feels like a major work and I would recommend it both as a dedicated approach to the figure of Buddha and as classic of storytelling. But Buddha is most importantly enjoyable to see Tezuka developing some of his most irreverent and personal jokes, interwoven in story.However, given the subject it lacks the sensationalist and gripping (if repetitive) taste of some of his one mammoth serialized volumes such as MV or the Ode to Kirihito. Buddha is published in English in 8 volumes and things really take shape towards volume 3 or 4, and become quite amazing in terms of the medium towards the final part. If you are not in for the full ride I'd probably recommend other works from him."
2,Euro Bias,"While presenting an impressive collection of information about Texas natives, Newcomb's work is flawed by an air of cultural superiority. The author seems to accept the notion that Indian culture in times past was less advanced than that of the European conquorers. Thus, Indian houses were hovels, Indian religions superstition, and Indian diets barbarian. Such bias calls into question the accuracy of Newcomb's observations, not to mention his conclusions."
2,Half-baked cookbook,"This book was okay for a beginner, I suppose, but the way I see it, anyone that would be aware of and interested in astrological transits is looking for something more substantial. Howard Sasportas' book on the transits of the outer planets, Gods of Change, is a much more useful tool, although it would be wonderful to see a full length book on Uranus."
1,Didn't work on Bell tube w/ Presta valve,"As my title said, we have a Bell puncture-resistant (Slime) tube with a Presta valve. This did not work with our tube in adapting to Schrader."
1,Sleeve too long,The sleeve on the shrader end is too long to allow the pump pin to open the valve. Only works if it installed very tightly on presta valve and then the pump is rammed in as far as possible.
1,Presta to Shrader adapter,I thought it would have the small valve in it. INot worth it. two stars is generous. not much else to say.
4,Does what it needs to do,"I found it a little difficult to remove the pump nozzle from this adapter after filling up. I also have a brass adapter with which I have no problem, so I know it's this adapter and not the nozzle. Otherwise it works just as advertised, and the aluminum is very lightweight."
2,Not the correct size,"My shipment of 3 adapters did not work as designed or advertised. When screwed on the Presta valve stem, they were just a bit too long for the air chuck to engage the center pin of the valve, thus no air could get past it to inflate the tire. With a bit of work on a grindstone I trimmed them down about .060 so they would work, but I prefer not having to modify or repair things I paid for right out of the box."
4,Works,I bought this because I have a quality schrader pressure gauge but no way to get pressure off of my presta valve stems. My gauge works with the adapter on but my Blackburn pump does not. It will not depress the center of the valve stem far enough. It works fine on standard Schrader valve stems so there is something a little different going on with the adapter. I have to pump with the adapter off and put it on to take the pressure which gets old. The adapter does work alright with my compressor air hose attachment though I do have to press fairly hard. It makes filling tires at home easy but I will still use the thumb squeeze pressure gauge on the trail.
5,Bicycle waterproof yellow cell phone,Fits perfectly on Presta valves. I carry one in each of my bicycles incaseI need air from a service station. Great!
3,If it doesn't work for you...,"...check to see if the chuck on your air pump has its own air valve. Unlike an actual Schrader valve, this adapter lacks the pin that is supposed to hold open a chuck valve. This adapter won't work with a lot of the cheap electric air compressors currently being sold. A work around (assuming the chuck can be disassembled) is temporarily removing the chuck's valve."
3,Presta-valve Adapters,"These presta-valve adapters are handy to have around, if you come into a town without the proper hose chuck, it'll make your life easier...invest, but the O-Ring that seals is a one time use, try to find extras and they'll last longer...happy trails"
3,Not directly suitable for pressure mesurement,"If you are buying this to check your tire pressure on a presta valve using a standard tire pressure gauge, then note this. The shrader end of the adapter is roughly twice as long as it should be in order to align with the top of the presta valve pin. Consequently, a pressure gauge will not be able to press down the presta pin to release the tire air for pressure measurements. You need to cut the shrader threaded end in half without damaging the threads. This will be just about the right length to expose the presta pin at the top."
2,overpriced,"I bought one of these for 5 bucks on here but the ones Performance Bike sells are EXACTLY THE SAME and cost only 99cents, lol. So I bought a couple of them so I'd have some spares and sure enough, even in practice, they are the same. I felt pretty silly knowing I paid 5 times that amount even though I ""bought it online"" which is suppose to be cheaper than brick and mortar shops. Not always."
4,Cheaper than expected.,"I expected to get the nice grey steel or aluminum presta adapter. I ended up with some spotty brass looking one. Nonetheless, it works just fine."
4,The Pantene Pro-V Shampoo Plus Conditioner was a ...,"The Pantene Pro-V Shampoo Plus Conditioner was a very nice product. It had a nice smell to it -- not overpowering, just pleasant smelling. It conditioned very well, but with the ease of a two-in-one. Other similar products (other two-in-one shampoos) tend not to have a good conditioning agent, but this one does. The only thing I've noticed thus far with this product, is that it tends to build up in your hair a little bit, almost like a bit of a waxy coating. I'm sure that a deep cleansing with a clarifying shampoo once a week would help to compensate for this. All in all, I'm very pleased with this shampoo and would gladly and happily switch to this one as my everyday shampoo."
2,While it seems like a great idea to ...,"While it seems like a great idea to combine the shampoo and conditioner, the results were quite disappointing. My hair is dry/normal and I had to use my regular conditioner after shampooing with this product. My husband, who has normal/oily hair, used it and was also displeased with the outcome -- overconditioned. In summary, if one fits EXACTLY into the """"normal"""" range, this might be a great product. This family gives it a """"thumbs down""""."
3,Over the past few days I've tried the ...,"Over the past few days I've tried the Pantene Shampoo Plus Conditioner and I didn't really like how it worked on my hair. I have long, thick, dry hair and I wash my hair every day of the week. I've tried a few different kinds of shampoo plus conditioner, but they all made my hair greasy. I've never tried the Pantene shampoo plus conditioner, and I was curious about how it would work on my hair. It worked the same as the rest. I love using Pantene shampoo and conditioner separately, but the two-in-one just didn't work for me. I allowed my friend to use the shampoo and it worked great for him. Basically, I think that it probably works better for people who have short hair rather than those who have long hair."
5,Be spellbound by it!,Its such an amazing book..Definitely a must read for teen girls! There are many characters in the book teens can identify with. Its definitely a good book to read.
4,Just want the plain style back,"I love these books, my only complaint is i want the plain ones...no fancy designs like this one...but, it serves its purpose"
5,Outstanding Texas music....,"Whether your in the mood for a nice slow love song (Must Have been Meant to Be) or a fantastic pick me up (Chicken Pluckin'), this cd has it all from a fantastically gifted Texas artist....Have been to only 2 of Jason's concerts but both were outstanding; great music from a great artist. I personally recommend this cd to any country music fan.....God bless, Marty"
1,What is going on??,"It's not common of me to not finish a book. But this one I gave up on. First of all. There was so much in their past going on that I felt like I was stepping into the middle of a series. I found it very confusing. Another thing I didn't like was the hero, Cord, in the story. What a jerk. I could't grasp the idea of why the heroine, Maggie, saw in him. He wants. Then pushes her away. Then he wants her. Then pushes her away. And not in a polite way. I own other Palmer books. And I certainly will giver her another try. But nevr this one."
4,Love Diana Palmer...,"I love Diana Palmer books, and I loved this book. I just imagined that they were best friends, and not brother and sister of any kind (foster or blood). I loved Maggie, she was so self assured yet deep down the child was still there that went through all the yucky stuff. And Cord was there to help her through it, without judging her. Typical case of 2 stubborn, hard headed people trying to escape the inevitable."
3,fantastic sex but slightly dissapointing,"I have to say that this is NOT one of my favourite diana palmer books. It really fell short on my expectations. Maybe because i was entralled by the story of maggie and cord since ""mercenary's woman"" and started to fantasise about it. Needless to say, i was gutted. The storyline felt too forced and too unrealistic, combining espionage and romance and along with trauma and past histories. Although DP really delivers in terms of the love making scens. It is hot and steamy but what really turns me off (and i'm sure for other people)is the line ""make me pregnant"". All in all, this is a GOOD book, just not what i've come to expect from one of my favourite authors."
2,Could have been better...,"this is the second Diana Palmer book that I've read and I don't believe that I'll buy anymore of her books. The blackmailer threating to give Maggie's secret to the news was a stupid thing to put in the book. No news agency would have used the materials, child pornography is illegal."
1,Not worth the price,"I've enjoyed reading Diana Palmer and have done so for many years, but her books now seem outdated. And this last one is a prime example. Although Ms Palmer is trying to make her heroine more capable of taking care of herself, the males in this book still treat the females as though they were children. The plot held a great deal of promise but the writing style just wasn't up to it. I kept asking myself, if it was that easy to shut down the bad guys, why hadn't someone else done it long ago? One of this writers strongest points is her ability to write great love scenes, but even that is off in this book, since the h/h spend most of the time congratulating themselves on a job well done."
2,"Same old, same old.........","As a former DP fan, I've sworn off her books lately. How many times can you re-hash the same old love scenes (mostly with the same old dialogue)? I took a chance on this book for some light summer reading, but unfortunately, I was disappointed to find the usual characters, redundant plot lines and predictable banter. Also, why are all romance writers so hung up on COWBOYS as main characters? Try moving from the horse trough to the BMW lot, please!"
3,A Matter of Trust,"Cord Romero is not so much a desperado at the title leads us to believe.He is a mercenary who survived a murder attempt, but his is looking for vengeance.Maggie Barton Cord's foster sister is a woman who got a bad deal early in life. She and Cord have a leave me alone relationship.They are forced to trust one another when their very survival depends on it.I own all Diana Palmer Books, but this was not one of my favorites. pg 98, and 100, lets you know he is going to rip her guts out."
1,come on now...,"I too am an avid reader of Diana's books, but enough is enough. I have to agree with some of the other reviewers below that it is boring to read about the same old, same old plotlines. Diana was great in her glory days, but it appears that with each new book she writes the characters seem the same as in previous ones. I was very reluctant to pay hardcover price for this book but read some of the previews and thought I would take the chance. I was really hoping this new novel would be different, but lo and behold we have another rewrite of her previous books. I wished I had listened to my misgivings and saved myself twenty one dollars. I don't want to down Diana, but she really needs to give her fans something more than this. Her females need to be updated badly and the men need to tone down the gorilla act and written in a more believable manner. Save yourself some time and money by just getting this one at the used bookstore if you really feel the need to read it."
5,OOH LALA!!,"You have to love this book, the pages practically turn themselves. I especially love the chemistry between Maggie and Cord...Cord is another man who seems to hit me much as Colby Lane does, the all masculine, ex mercenary who will do whatever it takes to take down those who threaten his woman and/or the weak...I especially love the scenes of danger and serveillence......"
1,"Would not Recommend - I would not have rated it a one star, but a star was required.","The main reason I purchase this space heater was for the remote control. After we received it and the remote control was not in the box, is when we found out the remote was discontinued. Also, the stove did not work. Only one of three plates heated up. I am in the process of returning the product."
2,Not the best Prophecy DVD I have ever watched,Not much discussion of Israel in the documentary and it's depiction of the antichrist is a little different than what I believe. I don't expect him to be walking around in robes looking like Jesus as the documentary seems to imply.
5,Amazing Facts,Awesome! I really enjoyed it! So amazing to know in details what's gonna happen in a future! I would highly recommend this DVD!
2,Bible Quotes,"This DVD features bible quotes with commentary, focusing on: Millenium, the End of Sin, Final Signs, World Polarized, The King Returns. Daniel predicted an increase in knowledge."
3,I question its biblical accuracy,"Over the years, I have watched many movies and read many books (to include the Bible) on end time's prophecy. I feel that this DVD goes against some of what I have found to be biblically accurate. It is well put together and well produced, but all portions are not in-line with the bible. I believe there are some inaccuracies. Watch this production with caution and use your Bible to verify the information it gives you."
1,Varied from the Word,"Unfortunately, some of the teachings in this DVD varied greatly from the Word of God. May the Lord give the creator of this DVD some desperately-needed revelation knowledge. Viewers beware."
4,Interesting,"I think some of these parents have lost perspective about what they are doing and why. Especially Juliana's dad, he seems kooky about the whole application process. This is preschool and they are 3 year olds! I don't think not getting into a $15,000-$20,000 per semester nursery school will ruin anyone's chances of getting accepted into an Ivy years later. Alot of things can happen in the intervening years. I understand the competition due to the limited number of spots and high number of applicants, but really I think some of these parents are losing sight of what's important. Layla's parents seemed the normal. This documentary was entertaining and fun to watch - I can't believe the pressure some of these parents put on themselves."
4,mesmerizing black comedy,"I've watched this ""documentary"" several times on cable. The children are adorable. This is like Sex and the City Married with Children because the adults are doing things that make no sense to the rest of us, spending too much money to do it and why the heck are they living in Manhattan, anyway? The film is like watching a really weird three-legged, potato sack, egg in a spoon relay race that is going on only in the MINDS of the participants. It's weird but again, the children are ADORABLE."
2,Not for learning Chet's songs,"Disappointed b/c no complete breakdown of Chet's songs. Disc 1 is about basic/general stuff (alternative bass & arpeggio), and Disc 2 is about licks. I wanted to be able to play a whole song, not only the solos. There is no instruction of that sort (even no tabs included). I was not interested in what scale Chet uses, but wanted to know how Chet played the whole song (fingering and voicing)... BTW, I was surprised there was no clip of Chet's playing songs on the 2 discs."
5,Earth Shaking,"This book's subjects are areas that will shake the foundation of most of today's Christian religions. Mr. Bushby makes no precepts without ample references. It is NOT the book to buy for ""light reading"" as I would constantly check his references. (All checked out.) I am sure an autodefe during the ""Inquisition"" would have burned him before sundown!Mr. Bushby did a great job on a monsterous subject.Now I would like to see the same research done to the Koran (Qur'an). But that would be dangerous, unlike discussions of the Holy Bible."
1,Ok until I read chapter 13- Cardinal Mohammed,"jesus may or may not have existed. Mohammed certainly did- there is contemporary historical evidence. But to quote some bizarre source who claimed hundreds of years after Mohammeds death that he was a failed papal candidate-His book is doomed from this suggestion. No wonder he does not wish to enter into discussions with readers. What a strange individual this man must be, and I am a devout atheist"
3,"Great animation, week story","I love the 00 series, love the mechs, love the charactors and love the story line. The movie carries the mechs and charactors but the story is week. No real details of the alien race, especially since it was brought up in the end of the first season. Happy I saw it and will keep it. It was worth watching but doesn't really flow with the series."
3,Wraps up the Series,"It wraps up the Gundam 00 series... the storyline is completely outrageous*******!!!!SPOILER!!!!*******Its like the producers were like :"" Season 2 ended with no war... who can we use for an antagonist for Celestial Being?"""
1,not true gundam,"ok gundam is about wars human vs human in big mechs not humans vs aliens this just seems like a fan fic that got turned in to a movie I love gundam 00 but this movie just sucks basicly aliens are comming to earth and only ""setsuna""(not sure if i spelled that right) can save us the rest of the earth force and the gundams are there to slow down the aliens long enough to snap setsuna out of what ever emo crap he was going through I feel if someone would have slaped him and yelled ""deal with this crap later humanity is about to die get your ass out there and stop it"" it would have saved alot of lives"
5,mmmm ..... Pu-erh,Great in-depth overview of the varieties of tea and drinking vessels! You need this book.
3,pleasant surprise,started out a little boring but came through about half way to the end.A nice read
2,leaves me yearning for good literature,"Why do sappy stories like this always make it big at Christmas time? Don't get me wrong; I love an inspiring story, but this is just too over-the-top sappy. I like good writing, good plot lines, character development; this book has none of these elements. It's just too tidy and too neatly tied up in a bow....even for a Christmas story. Save your money and buy ""Best Christmas Pageant Ever"" which is also a feel-good story, but will have you laughing out loud and being uplifted also."
5,Modern day Masterpiece!,"When you finish this book, you truly feel inspired! Service, and simply thinking of others, brings untold blessings. Wright is a wonderful writer...and this book has a timeless message. A ""must read"" for the holiday season!Also recommended:Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voicesby John Allen...wonderful story that explores same theme as Christmas Jars."
4,Warm and Fuzzy,This is a great book and leaves you wanting to carry on the traditions stated in the book. Perfect book to read to family in November to get ready for the Christmas season
5,A great way of blessing people,This is a very interesting book with many unusual stories of needy people receiving a jar full of coins & cash (many times annomously).These jars bless both the giver & receiver.
5,Extravagant Love,This is a great story about extravagant love shown to others. It's a small way all of us can reach out to people in need during the holidays. It's short and makes you want to help others. The story is inspirational and you can read it in a day. It makes a great Christmas gift or stocking stuffer. I bought 25 and passed them out to friends and neighbors because I wanted to pass on the story and get others involved in giving.
5,Christmas Jars - True Meaning of Christmas,"Had a discussion of this book with a friend. When consulted about a b'day present, I said make a contribution to your jar and send me the book. Reading the book moved me to tears---in ""Oprah speak""--my Aah Hah Moment. Truly the real meaning of Christmas. Buy a copy of the paperback, recycle a jar; pass it on to a friend."
5,Great gift for my adult children!,"I gave each of my three adult children this book for Christmas and they loved it. Starting last year, we have donated a gift to charity for each of our children and this year they did the same for us. This book just reinforced the idea of giving to others and the blessing that it brings to the giver."
3,"good packaging,good story.","Loved the story,packaged well,but book took over 2 weeks to get to me,would not buy anything from this place again."
3,EHHH it was just okay.,"I finished this book, so it was that good; however, it wasn't great. I do not think I would recommend it to anyone. The story line was a little weak, while reading it I kept thinking it was something you would find in a Readers Digest."
5,Christmas Jars,This Book is a real tear jerker i couldn't put it down and me and my family have started our own Christmas jar!!! This was amazing!!!
5,A short read that changes lives,"I have not heard of anyone who has read this book that was not touched in some way. I think my experience was typical. After reading the book, I purchased 10 more to give as gifts. Mine went to co-workers. Our whole family read and loved the story and, yes, of course, we have our own Christmas Jar started for next year!"
5,Christmas Jars,"If you want a VERY touching book, READ this one, and pass on a Christmas Jar of your own!!!GREAT book!!! Thanks!!"
5,Best Book Ever - DO NOT WAIT FOR XMAS - GREAT GIFT,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is heart warming, sweet, and extremely well written. I am in a book club and intend to recommend it to the whole group. The author is able to engage the reader from the first page until the last. I highly recommend this book for anyone. It would make a great book to use as a discussion point with your children as well."
5,A must read! Then pass it along!,I had read this last year and bought 5 this year to give as gifts. Every person I gave one to said they read it in one sitting. Couldn't put it down and loved it.They have set up a jar and passed along the book. Everyone should have and share the experience of this heartfelt book.
5,Christmas Jars,"I decided this year at Christmas our family needed to do something different, start a new tradition. I bought 3 books and are having my family pass them around to read and make jars to fill for 2013 . Next year at our Christmas gathering we will report on what we did with the filled jars."
5,GREAT STOCKING STUFFER,This book is a great one to buy several copies of to give as Christmas book to a co-worker or teacher. It encapsulates the meaning of Christ-mas. Paying it foward..............
5,best christmas book ever,This book was given to me as a gift. It's AWESOME! I ordered 8 books to give as gifts for Christmas. Gives a new meaning to Christmas
5,Perfect for Christmas,This book was fabulous. I Gave it away as gifts with jars of money. Now we can pass it on.
3,Sweet message but...,"Good book, fast read. The book has a great message which I really enjoyed but I think the characters themselves could have had a little more depth, including Hope. I like my characters to be a little more flawed but Hope, even in her weakest moments was still half Angel Sent From Heaven. I also felt that I would have liked her relationship with the Maxwell family to be more detailed. It seemed to me that the writer wanted to fly through minor details to get to the beautiful ending. Other than that, I thought the book was great. I love that the story is wrapped into a story and I love the meaning and thoughtfulness of Christmas Jars. In fact, our family has started our own!"
3,"Cute, but overrated","Christmas Jars was a cute story, but predictable. It was an easy read, but left me feeling like I should have chosen another book with a little less fluff. Giving to those in need is a good message, but we can give our time, prayers, etc.. in addition to money. I wish that the author would have somehow woven those ideas of giving into the storyline to remind us that money doesn't solve everything. Especially, the loss of a loved one."
5,Heartfelt Christmas read......a great tradition!,"This is a simple yet 'hearfelt - feel the Christmas spirit on every page' book. I really enjoyed it. The idea of a Christmas Jar is just brillant. A great way to keep the Christmas spirit all year long. It's such a short story that to tell any details almost gives the entire book away. So I have to just say read it. Give it to your friends, family, teachers and anyone else you know. Make it a tradition. I plan to."
5,Don't Wait For Christmas,"This short little read by Jason F. Wright is perhaps the best book I've read in some time. Christmas Jars will inspire you to rethink the Christmas spirit and change not only the way you approach Christmas throughout the year, but also how you approach life and giving.It won't take you long to read this one, not simply because of its size, but because you won't be able to put down this heartwarming story. There have only been a few books that I've read that I want to buy for everyone I know, and this is one of them. Don't wait until Christmas to read this book."
4,Can't go wrong!,"My husband picked this up an early gift for me and I'm so glad I didn't wait to read it! While the book isn't perfect and I wished certain storylines had been more developed, I thoroughly enjoyed every page and read it in two short sittings.I had to roll my eyes at another review here that mentioned the young woman's article in the paper near the end of the book. THAT WAS MY FAVORITE PART! Different strokes for different folks :0)"
3,Enjoyable but not my favorite Christmas book,"This was a nice story, but I it was just too simple for me. I know it was supposed to be a Christmas story, but the circumstances made it more of a fairy tale. I just didn't buy the whole premise and I didn't feel there was a need for deception to get an interivew with the people in the story"
5,A New Family Tradition,"This book might be small but its packed with a powerful message and it shows a family how to start their own Christmas Jar to give away, loved this book."
4,I loved the story.,"Christmas Jars is an inspiring story of unconditional love, of forgiveness and of redemption. The true spirit of Christmas shows through the loving acts of cheerful giving that define the noble characters in this book.After I'd read the first two pages, it couldn't have been harder for me to put this book down if the cover had been made of fly paper. Besides keeping a copy for my wife and myself, I bought additional copies for our four daughters' families."
5,A Book to Change Your Life,"It's a very special book. Could be read in one sitting. In this poor economic times, especially, it makes you think of your wants and your needs; you can be very happy as a hardworking individual. Save a little each week and it will add up but it's not the amount that counts! Then you think about helping less fortunate friends or strangers. Can't beat this book for a ""good"" read! I've started my Christmas jar for next year and have several people in mind to give it to.....probably will pull their name out of another jar!"
5,"Read a few week, at least, before Christmas!!!","Christmas schmaltz, sure - but I LOVE Christmas schmaltz! A great little book to motivate Christmas kindness - and it's best if you have a little time beforehand to have fun with the idea!"
4,Woow - A book you won't want to put down,"This book is a book that as you read it you will not want to put it down. It a very good book that will make you look at your life in a ""I have to do this in my life kinda way"" book. Its a easy reading book, enjoy it. I did and when your done pass it on to one of your friends or family members.Lonestar"
4,Christmas Jars,"A book should serve to inspire a person in some way: in how one thinks about a subject or even acts. This is a fictional story about a young woman's life journey through its twists and turns, trials and tribulations. It reveals to us the importance of family (however defined), of love, and of our own coming to terms with how we choose to live our lives. The truer meaning of Christmas is not in expensive gift giving but in the simpler gifts of sharing and caring symbolized by the simplicity of coins in a jar. It inspired me to begin my own Christmas Jars project and in doing so I felt the true JOY of the season."
4,Sweet holiday story,"Sappy, yeah. But it's an uplifting Christmas book. It's not a religious book, just a feel good story (think Pay It Forward vein). This was a very fast read and made me want to go out and do a good deed for someone. I think we sometimes get so wrapped up in ourselves that we forgot even the smallest of kindnesses.It was a good book to read this time of the year. Had I read it in February or something, I might have said it was too sappy and had some ""flow"" issues, but ya know what? It doesn't matter. It was a very sweet storyline. This would also make a great gift!"
2,"Book called ""Christmas Jars.""",Great book. I received it for Christmas last year and have given as a Christmas gift to several this year.
2,I almost had to hurl when I was done reading this!,"There really is a good story in here.... it just needed to be written by someone else.The problem with this book is that the author takes so many ""cheap shots"" to tug at hour heart that it becomes OVERBEARING and OBNOXIOUS. There are ways to tug at someone's heart without going so overboard that it becomes cheap and that's exactly what it felt like to me when I was done reading this book. I was gagging so loud at the end that I almost woke the neighbors.The only reason why I gave this book two instead of one star is because even with all the overbearing cheap shots it did make a good point to start your own jar."
1,God is absent here,"This short book is also short on plot. That wasn't the worst part, however, This supposedly ""Christmas"" story has no mention of God whatsoever! Nothing...nada. How can this be in a book about Christmas? Christ is completely removed from this story which has an inspiring message, but the author apparantly believes that God has nothing to do with our lives, our goodness, our generosity, our faith...or even Christmas. DUH!"
4,Inspiring story!,This is a remarkable story of a very brave soldier who was a prisoner at the Hanoi Hilton for 5 years. He returned to our country and has lived an inspiring life since.
5,Every Fitness DVD Should Be Like This,"I am a guy with tight hamstrings and this one in a short period seems that have opened them up. Pilates is not traditionally a ""man"" thing for me and most guys I know, but this one really is challening and has helped me open my hamstrings, and I never knew Pilates worked the abs so damn much, or at least in this DVD. Many great features most important the variety in workout times from 10 minutes to 60. No complaints here."
4,Very Good,"As a personal trainer I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who considers themselves inflexible, or recovery from injury. I've tried it myself as I recent had a hamstring injury and over the years I have added a series of fitness DVDs and his is certaintly one of the best."
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought this DVD because of all the great reviews I saw. After watching it, I don't get what people liked about it. If you've ever taken a Pilates class, this DVD is about 100 times easier. When I saw the title I thought it meant it would help you with your flexibility. After watching it, I think they meant that if your inflexible, buy this DVD because you won't have to move much. Through most of the video, she's barely moving! It may be good if your very old or injured, otherwise, I would recommend either a Pilates class or a different DVD."
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought this DVD to help my partner develop greater flexibility and strengthen his weak back. We discovered two major problems with this DVD: 1) the exercises were not at all challenging (and didn't provide variations to increase intensity); and 2) not only did some of the exercises hurt (I had strange back pains in the middle of the workout), but many of the transitions between exercises completely ignore the inflexible nature of the audience. We've tried some of the alternative workouts in hopes of finding something we liked, but even if we could find something that worked, we simply don't like it--the hostess is uninspiring and the workout sequences are uncreative."
4,Nice intro to Pilates,"good instructions and easy to follow DVD. As I am new to pilates, I found this DVD a good introduction. This DVD is well titled, I was able to keep up and do the different positions."
4,"I'm inflexible, and yes I can do it","I really like how you can customize your workout to what you want to do. For example, you can do arms and abs, legs and abs, etc. Sometimes I feel that it is not very challenging, but all you have to do then is pause it and do a few extra reps!"
4,Good for beginners,"I used to work out to Jillian Michaels every day, but a few months ago I developed an illness that causes terrible pelvic pain, so Jillian Michaels was out of the question. I quit working out for about 4 months and this is the first thing I tried when I got back to working out. I'm only 20, but so far this DVD has been pretty good for me. It is a little slow at times but its good for getting down the basics of pilates/yoga and developing your core and flexibility before you move on to the advanced stuff, and I can feel my core getting stronger when I do it. This DVD also comes in a 3 pack with pilates sculpt and tone and pilates for weight loss, and this video is the perfect stepping stone to being able to complete those."
5,Just what I was hoping for,"This is for those of us who need a more remedial approach to Pilates, not for people who can do a standard beginner level video. So, if you want to get the benefits of Pilates but the standard modifications on other videos are still too hard, get this DVD. It's exactly what you have been hoping for. It does have extra flexibility work with yoga, which you shouldn't overlook. Do it. I never thought I would be able to do Pilates (or yoga) and if I can, anyone can."
1,A little disapointed...,I purchased this because I am new to the world of Pilates. I don't have a lot of flexability and thought this would more or less work with that. Instead it was almost like it was for elderly or infirmed people who CAN'T bend. It would be great for those older folks who can't bend as well but for a person who is just lacking in flexibilty it is a little too light.
5,Just what I was looking for,"I have never done Pilates but because of major back issues was a little hesitate to try. This DVD is perfect for my needs. The Instructions are clear and modifications are suggested or shown if any pain is experienced. There are so many choices as to routines according to your time and mobility level. After one session of a 15"" routine my abs felt pleasantly sore that night. (but not my back). There is even a section with Yoga but I am pacing myself and not going to overdo yet.I am very pleased with this purchase and will buy the other DVD FOR YOGA for Inflexible people once my back issues are solved. For someone who is in excellent shape with no mobility issues this might not be challenging enough. But as I said for someone who is very stiff and wanting a safe beginners routine this might be perfect."
1,Not a fan...,I want to feel like I am with the instructor. I am not a fan of the voice over. I prefer the DVD where the instructor is the one doing and talking. This feels wooden and not very inspiring.
3,Not for me,"I bought this DVD when I was starting out to get fitter, flexible and tighten up my core. I was afraid I was too inflexible to do anything active without injury. However, when I sat down one morning to check this DVD out and try the routines, I was bored out of my mind.Other reviewers have mentioned the glacial aspect of the presentation. I agree with it. I found myself wanting to move faster, or at least faster than the pace of a poky pony! And yes, the background/setting is dark and reminded me old New England houses now used as yoga/pilates/arts centers with tons of darkwood, etc. Margaret is likable enough, but her style did not click with me.I'm off to try and sell it; perhaps it can do some good for someone else."
1,Wouldn't recommend this dvd,"This dvd is not challenging or motivating at all. I bought it because it seemed to have great reviews...it unfortunately didn't do anything for me. I've tried various segments and they are all pretty much the same. The instructor's voice is calming but as another reviewer mentioned, the transitions between exercises are awkward. There doesn't seem to be much of a flow to it.I also bought ""The Biggest Loser - Weight Loss Yoga"" and that is a much better workout than this dvd."
2,Not for someone that wants a workout,"I was looking for a pilates video that would give a good workout, but have modifications for people who aren't flexible enough to do a lot of the moves. This was not that dvd. This would be a great video for older people wanting to stretch out, but as for breaking a sweat, forget it. I was so bored watching the video. She moves at a very, very slow pace. Like I said, great for stretching but not for raising your heart rate."
2,Too slow even for inflexible people,"The pace of these exercises is too slow even for ""inflexible"" people. Also, since all fo the exercises are done on the floor, it's very inconvenient to be on the floor and to follow instructions. I lost my patience after five minutes of trying."
2,YAWNNNNN,"Ok, I may be should have read this better, but if you are intermediate to advanced, don't click that button, I am not the most flexible person, but strong as an ox, thought this might help, but I could not tell if I am exercising or sleeping, should not have bought it..."
4,"Good Stuff, but alittle repetitive",I heard the song Mitternacht on Shoutcast and I had to buy the CD. The first couple of songs are great. But by the time you get to the last couple of tracks it gets repetitive and boring.
2,CHI TOWN STAR,"""Cult Status"" is nothing but CORNY!!! Buy Common's new CD ""BE"" if u want on point music and lyrics, u won't be disappointed, I promise."
1,I gave it 2 listens just to make sure it was lousy,"OK so I hear Kamachi on Jedi Mind Tricks ""Violent By Design"" Album and I remember the track with Kamachi where I thought he made all the other MC's look bad. So I expect more of the same. Thing is, he doesn't even sound the same. Maybe it's just creative effects on his vocals, I don't know. Different flow, lyrics aren't as potent and his voice is quite a bit more grimy. On top of all that the beats were ho-hum. Bah, waste of money. Anyone need a coaster?"
3,"Nice, powerful sound, but out of focus","This is the fifth Iron Savior album, and the last in the overall sci-fi saga of their super weapon/sentient space station. I admit I like the whole concept of the story, but in this album it was running thin and the overall tale is cofusing...an anti savior...a renegade scientist??? I guess this is why they left behind the whole thing after this one. In the musical deparment the band delivers, make no mistake about it. But they started to sound the same, like many other german power metal bands, they hit a point where they feel the found a formula and then they stick to that like super glue. But Iron Savior is one of the best, and even with that flaw, this is a good metal album."
3,Noah Chose the dove,"This is cute book, but the pictures, in my opinion, are much to impressionist for a toddler to see. The adults enjoy the art and thestory was to wordy for a little one to stay interested. I would opt for a different book on Noah, but I will keep the book on my shelf!"
4,The bible on CD,I was very pleased with the quality of the cd's. I would also like to extend the set to include the old testament
3,Missing CD 12,"I bought this to listen to while driving. I have enjoyed it. However,there was one problem. I received two copies of CD #11 and no CD#12. James Earl Jones does a great job, but I could have done without some of the music."
2,Music very distracting,"If you could get this audio bible without music, I would rate it a 5 star +++. James Earl Jones is phenomenal. The music needs to be eliminated or turned way down. In other words, go back in the studio and remix it."
2,overrated,"I bought this series, but was disappointed. By the package review, I was expecting wonderful things, but the reading was excessively breathy, choppy, and occasionally halting. Furthermore it contains only the NT, not the whole Bible. The music is just to introduce new books of the Bible and is only a short repetitive phrase. Alexander Scourby is much superior in my opinion."
3,Is that you Earl?,I was a bit disappointed because Jones reads this great book as enthusiastic as criminal would walk to the gallows. I expected to hear his voice boom with enthusiasm as he narrates the bible. Not today!!
2,Disappointing Version of the New Testament,"I am a fan of audio books and looked forward to the terrificcombination of the majestic language of the King James NewTestament with the powerful voice of James Earl Jones. With very few changes this could have been an outstanding production.However the producers of this audio book polluted the marriage byintroducing sentimental music throughout the readings. The music is indescribably annoying. Put bluntly, the terrible visions of the end of times do not mix well with artificial holy melodies. In addition, the CDs do not separate the chapters of the New Testament into useable divisions. I am sorry that I can not recommend this audio product."
2,Do not operate heavy machinery while listening to this...,"I purchased this product to listen to during a long drive (12 hours each way). However, after only 20 minutes I had to stop playing it as it was soothing me to sleep. The narrator has a very consistent, repetitous rhythm to his reading, not quite monotone, but close. When combined with the constant 'lullaby' type background music, it is very relaxing...too relaxing. I not only felt like dozing off while driving, but found that the rhythm of the speaker occassionally made it difficult to pay attention to the actual words being read. James Earl Jones is such a powerful speaker, yet unfortunately he greatly limited his dramatic range for this reading. This would be a good product to listen to at night where dozing off to a biblical reading would be a great end to the day. Just don't take it on the road!"
3,It's ok,The seller did their part and delivered a product in good condition.The content is satisfactory. You will not captivated by James Earl Jones reading the bible. Part of the problem is the background music. I still love James Earl Jones voice regardless.
3,"Great voice, retakes are poorly dubbed","Th e corrections to the first take, seem the most annoying to this. Sounds like a different room, different mic almost a different person at times.Still it IS JAMES EARL JONES11:0"
2,Doesn't do him justice,"I am not an audio engineer, but in my opinion this rendition of Mr. Jones does not do justice to him. Also I have only listened to the first disc and a part of #14. But to me it sounded like this project was a ""rush him in and out as quickly as possible"" job. There were longer than necessary pauses, breaths, and a sped-up pace to Mr. Jones' voice. I was glad I had audio editing software to shorten the pauses, remove the breaths, and slow down the tempo to obtain the smooth, calm, relaxing tone I am used to hearing from Mr. Jones. I would consider buying one of the 16-disc versions of his reading instead of this 14-disc set.And contrary to other reviews, the music does not play through the entire reading."
4,It's All Good,I bought this used for very little money. It is only the NT and I did not realize that. All of the chapters are not introduced; he just starts reading. Overall this is wonderful; I downloaded it to my husband's Ipod to listen to while he exercises.
1,"Great concept, but..","Great concept, but there is music playing in the background.. which may sound nice to some, but it is VERY distracting, and there is nothing pleasing about it.. the whole time listening to this, i was trying to block out the music, so that i could here what James Earl Jones was saying.. you have to maintain complete focus while listening to this, because you're doing two things at once.. trying to block out the music, and listen to what is being said.. imagine watching your favorite tv show while people are doing construction in your house."
4,Audio New Testament,I Have this. I put it on my wish list and received as a gift. Wanted the Whole Bible and thought this was the whole Bible. It the description doesn't' really make it clear that this is only the New Testament. It is good to listen to. Just wanted the the Bible on CD.
3,"Great voice, great narration, but.....","Mr. Jones has just the right touch, and tone for this beautiful project. I have but one problem with this production. Where is the Old Testament? Otherwise I would have given this production 5 stars."
3,Grit,It's grit in a bag. What else do you need to know? I use it to mix with the food for my rescued pigeon.
5,Really different.,"Stash teas, overall, are very good--they use generous amounts of essential oils or flavoring agents in their mixes--in this case lemongrass. This tea is lemon and light mint with a grassy aftertaste.What's really interesting about this, is that it's a much lower caffeine tea even without the decaffeination process because it's white tea, or tea from the tips of the camellia sinensis (tea) plant. The lower down in the plant you go, the higher the amount of caffeine in tea made from the leaves.This is good for later in the day if you are one of those people who drinks tea all day long. Highly recommended.Edit: This tea grows on you. It's really good for drinking as iced tea if you're just thirsty."
4,Great for anyone who LOVES horses,"I had a friend in high school who loved horses and by loved I mean LOVED HORSES. They were all over her room and last I heard she was working with a Veterinarian so I guess it worked out. As soon as I heard I was receiving this book to review I thought of her and wished we had stayed in better touch so I could pass this book on to her.Rusty: The High-Flying Morgan Horse (Morgan Horse Series) is the third book in Ellen F. Feld's Morgan Horse Series. A cute book, well written which made it easy to get into the characters. I think a bit of it was lost on me because I don't know that much about horses and don't share my friend's LOVE of them. I think any child that is into horses boy or girl would like reading this series. These books could be the fuel that takes a spark that is a love for horses and turns it into a lifelong passion to own, preserve and care for horses in adulthood."
3,I've seen better,"I thought the movie was good, but you need to really pay attention to the movie. You can get lost real easy. The story line was a little different.I don't always give the best reviews to help someone in deciding if they want to buy or rent the movie, I don't want to give the movie away in any way so I ususally only post my thoughts or opinion. Which my opinion of the movie is, that it is a fairly good movie, not the best, but I wasn't bored in the movie. It is just one of them movies I won't put back in the dvd player to watch again."
1,I wish I had a premonition that told me not to watch this movie,The only good part of this movie is that it offers the prospect of going back in time and not watching it.
2,I should have had a premonition before I wasted my money,"I'm a big Sandra Bullock fan, but she's let me down more than once- SPEED 2 comes to mind, and this movie too.I have to admit that she didn't have much to work with, but she produced this turkey, so she has no excuse.There is really nothing going for this film, even the rip-off of Phillip Glass' FACADES score. The plot is confused, meant to be so as to build suspense, but there is really no suspense, and by the time the movie ends you've figured it out and don't really care.Sandra, and you, can do better."
1,"Pretty cool idea, Bad concept of ""TIME""!!!","Don't worry say too much, since this movies not worth a lot of time to write a review. Just one thing, if you are the one that gonna give this movie 4-5 stars, before you do that, please go back and watch this movie again, you will find out the day that between Wednesday'morning (Her husban die)and Thursday's morning (She woke up at home, and the police apporch her.) If you see your hushan die in front of you, and you rather stay at home and not stay at the hospital, how the heck happen???? If someone can answer my question? Since I've watching and watching the ending and the begining, and I still can't find out the answer."
1,OVER A MONTH & I'M STILL WAITING =(,"I bought this movie 04/09, as of today 05/13 the movie has not arrived. I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! I bought 3 other movies the same day from different sellers I got all these movies at the promised time. I sent an email to the seller HAS NOT responded either."
1,Premonition (blu-ray),"This dvd did not play at all. Also I got a replacement dvdand that did not play either. I am still waiting for a refund,so I can't review this movie at all."
2,horrible,"Okay, i saw this movie on Friday and it started off pretty good. The actors were great. The plot however, started off fine but died off towards the end. The soundtrack was horrible and that annoying horror music played everytime something that was supposed to be suspenseful (but wasn't) was going to happen. The message of the story didn't go along with the movie at all and at the end, my sister and i looked at each other and said, ""What?!"" The ending was so disappointing! The ending made no sense and they completely botched up what could have been a great movie."
2,Another weirdo for Sandra,"She's a very good actress and especially good in comedy, but why has this actress chosen such awful films? First it was the weird one about the Lake Mystery, which you had to watch twice to even understand, and now another weird movie about premonitions. Oh, and how about the one where she played a witch who brought back a dead guy after she and her sister magically put him to rest. The first part of that movie was actually very good with a very good cast, but then it turned south and sour and totally absurd. Too bad. Sandra, find yourself a good script for a change. And please no more beauty contests either. I have liked 2 of her films. The Net and Two Weeks Notice. Surely she can find more good scripts like those."
1,"Wow, that was bad.","My wife and I just finished watching Premonition, and that is two hours of my life I wish I had back. One of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. Yikes!"
2,Tries but does not succeed,"Sandra Bullock does the best she can here, but that's with a substandard script and lackluster direction. This film does not feel very original or unique, and it seems as if everyone in it is trying too hard to make it plausible. Something really funny: SPOILER!!When Sandra sees her hubby's car blow up after being hit by a big rig, she is still yelling at him to get out of the car! How in the heck is he supposed to do that? Too funny. But also too silly."
2,You Say What?,Julian McMahon is better suited for TV dramas. He doesn't translate well on the big screen. Sandra Bullock is an excellent actress that seems to be cast in roles a cut below her ability. Put this all together with a confusing plot and you have a veritable mess.This was not a movie that begged to be made. Save your time unless you absolutely enjoy Sandra Bullock in whatever she does.
1,"This movie sucked, want to be depressed, could not finish this load of S%&*","Sandra Bullock has reached an all time low, this movie really sucked. I was depressed for the first 20 min, then it really started to get stupid and slow and slower, after 45 min, told my wife I could not waste any more of my life minites on this garbage. You are warned.P.Gossett."
1,The Worst Movie Of '07,"This movie had potential in the very ...very...begining, but leave it to Sandra Bullock to make another stipide love me.....the movie was boring, dumb and an coplete mess....it wasn't even suspenseful.....they need to make Sandra Bullock and her dumb movies get run over by a truck"
1,The Movie on the editing room floor,"A terrific actress drug down by a weak script and poor editing. By all appearances this movie was rushed out the door with out a care for continuity, with the best parts left laying on the cutting room floor. Ironically, with just a few more carefully placed edits this story could have been changed into a very dark comedy. Save your money, and skip this stinker!"
1,If you look up regret in the dictionary...,"I think there's probably a picture of Sandra Bullock's face after she realized what a piece of poo this movie turned out to be. Premonition had good intentions. I enjoyed the trailer immensely--not enough to see it in theatres--but enough to put it in my Netflix queue. After all, I enjoy Nip/Tuck and I haven't seen Julian McMahon in awhile. I would have been better off just putting N/T in the queue and getting my fix that way.I think you know the story. Sandra Bullock plays a woman whose husband dies in a car crash. Stunned and saddened, she goes to bed only to wake up and, whoa!, he's alive. Imagine that. Back and forth we go through a muddled story line, halfhearted acting, and a Julian McMahon who is completely unlikeable and (shudder) unattractive. What was the point? There wasn't one. That's what you need to know. I like bad movies. I own Glitter and am not ashamed. That being said, even I wouldn't own this movie. It's that bad."
4,Good movie great blue ray,I have only seen this in blue ray but it was a very good movie in that version I was surprized to see that it only had 3 stars so I thought I let you know if this is one you are considering for blue ray. Its really good
3,premonition review,"A housewife (Sandra Bullock) is devastated when her husband (Julian McMahon) dies suddenly in a car crash. But when he reappears the next day as if nothing had ever happened, she realizes it may have just been a premonition. Can she prevent the horrible tragedy from happening all over again, or is she powerless to redirect fate? Amber Valletta and Nia Long also star."
4,Wow! Roller Coaster Ride!,"Ok, the movie sounded like a tear-jerker. Boy was I wrong. This movie kept me in my seat and in front of the TV from start to finish. Having not read the previews, I was expecting to see a wife going through the grief process after losing her husband. Nope. The movie turned that idea on its head. Thanks to some creative editing, time sequences, and just brilliant acting by Sandra Bullock, this movie is worth the price of admission and cost of DVD. A very good movie. There were parts where my mouth was hanging open and I was shocked by actions in the movie. I actually shouted out, ""OH NO!"" during two parts. Brilliant direction. Brilliant editing. Sandra Bullock should be nominated for an Oscar -- or something. She knocked it out of the park with this movie."
3,Premonition review,"It's a cool movie that keeps you guessing, but unfortunately the ending is not that good after the whole build up. Still, definately worth watching on a Sunday afternoon."
5,Top-Notch,"The trailers for Premonition made it seem like the movie was formulaic, predictable, even laughable. But my friend said it was very good, and she brought it over for us to watch. I am so glad I gave it a chance. Sandra Bullock is wonderful as a woman who is living a week in which every morning she wakes up to a different reality. Everyone else - her mother, her kids, her girlfriend - seems to know what is going on except her. She even seems to begin to ride the weirdness a little until the occurence of more sinister events. There is a mysterious prescription bottle in her sink. Is she losing her mind or is this a warning? Even if it is a warning, how can she get out of the cycle if she can't get off the merry go round?Chilling thriller with a surprisingly warm ending. No, it is not what you think; not predictable at all."
3,Would you work a puzzle if its picture was ugly?,"This movie held my interest; I'll give it credit for that. But in the end it didn't give me what I wanted. This would be a good movie if the ending was more satisfying. It starts off well but gets derailed. This is a very average movie that, unfortunately, will be forgotten. Don't spend your money to see this unless you really have nothing better to do."
2,Premonition (Widescreen Edition),"Premonition (Widescreen Edition)In this movie Sandra Bullock, attempts at being psychic, are under played. Her attempts to reconcile reality with her visions cause many issues. One never knows wether or not we are in the present or the past, in the middle of a vision, or just a bad a dream. It does not seem that the star is to aware of it either. In attempt to leave clues of what may happen and what has transpired it gets extremely muddy. But one cannot help but feel as though you were on a roller coaster ride without a seat retraint. For what it is worth, fair acting, but just poorly written script."
5,For womens who loves their Family,We all live through a rautina to diary. Many women we leave ourselves to wrap of this routine and make the marriage forgotten. Premonition gives you a good message ... that you have to fight for what really it's imports for you..YOUR family. I recommend the movie 100 %. It is not only to see the routine of a woman is to understand that every day is a miracle.
3,All Dressed Up And No Place To Go,"While there are certainly worse ways to spend an hour and a half, this film is ultimately disappointing. The problem with a film like this is that it is either going to remain true to its title (Sandra Bullock is having a true premonition and she can't change destiny/fate) or it isn't (she will find a way to save her husband). The set-up of the film is intriguing at first, but once these parameters are established little interest is maintained because there is no where for the film to go."
1,Worst movie I've seen in a long time,"The only actor in this movie who didn't seem like she couldn't wait for it to be over was the youngest daughter (who probably wasn't old enough to know better). As for the rest of them, I know exactly how they felt."
1,"Horrific, and not in a good way","There is absolutely nothing good about this movie. You keep thinking that she will solve the problem, but the only thing she does is insure her doom. The sober mood of the movie, almost puts you to sleep, until you get to one of the most laughable endings in movie history, bested only by the ridiculous slaughter of Meg Ryan's character by a logging truck in City of Angels."
3,A little confusing,I found this movie a little confusing. How they jumped back and forth with the premonitions confused me. Most of the movie I was wondering is the guy dead or alive. It was just how they put the movie together.
2,Not very convincing,"Thirty minutes into the movie, I kept thinking to myself ""Have I seen this movie before?"" Maybe it was a ""Premonition"" that this movie was going to be as bad as it already was.....at the time. Alright, who put that bottle of Lithium on my nightstand? Even the worse ""Twilight Zone"" episode was better than this movie."
4,You need to have a premonition to really understand,"I think some people who rated this movie wanted something scarey. This may not seem scarey to them but it can be to people who experience these. It is very real. I LOVED Sandy in this movie as I do most of her movies. It was also well directed and you could really feel the emotions of all the actors. For those who will rate this low. This is not for kiddies, ya'll."
2,Sandra Bullock needs a hit!,Her career is headed downhill fast if she takes any more roles like this. Even watching in Blu Ray was painful. Week story line and poor casting. This is a one night rental.
2,A mixed-up mess,"Much as I like Sandra Bullock, I stayed away from this movie when it was in theaters because of the bad reviews. However, my husband wanted to see it so we rented it. It turns out the unfavorable reviews were right on target. This movie is really a muddled mess. It's the type of film where you just keep hoping that the denouement will make it all make sense and perhaps have some emotional resonance to it as well. Two examples of films which do an excellent job of this are ""The Sixth Sense"" and the Nicole Kidman film ""The Others."" Unfortunately, the ending to ""Premonition"" will most likely disappoint you and leave you wishing you had spent your time differently. My husband and I often have very different taste in movies, and the fact that our reactions to this film were identical is a pretty good indication that many other people will be disappointed as well. If you still want to see it, I would definitely suggest renting over buying."
3,Every day we are alive can be a miracle,"Shades of Groundhog Day or some more sophisticated what if time travel.I was surprised at how tight the story is and every minute, every word, and every movement had a part in this story. They actors were well chosen as from the beginning to end you believe their characters are real and that you are taking part in the story.House wife Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) finds out that her husband (Julian McMahon) has died. And wake up the next day to find him there. This is only the beginning. Soon she realized that it is probably a premonition. The story is also filled out with what could have been and what may have been. And what should have been. Sandra puts us all in a different Zeite.Happy Accidents"
1,I Wish I Had Had A Premonition About How Bad This Movie Was !,"The whole concept of the film was a good idea - unfortunately the script writers seemed to have lost their way with this one . From the very start holes were starting to appear - they just got bigger as the film moved along .The only saving grace for this film was the acting of Sandra Bullock - but she seems to take any movie role these days - it would seem without reading the scripts - or perhaps she does'nt care .None of the plot gelled together - it was disjointed and looked like the final scenes were decided upon at the last minute to fit the film into 90 minutes .The movie might have been more believable if the characters behaved as normal people would - none of them did - especially Sandra Bullocks character - she told everyone about the premonition of her husbands death except the husband himself - the mind boggles . I could reel off all the mistakes , but it might be fun to rent or buy t for the fun of finding them yourself !"
3,"INTERESTING, IF A BIT TOO TAME THRILLER!","This movie starts out promising and keeps your interest, but it never reaches a fever pitch we need in a good suspense thriller. Sandra Bullock does a fine job in this tepid little tale of faith and destiny that just had to have a somewhat positive ending. It's worth a look, but don't expect to be blown away."
3,Interesting,"Sandra Bullock is great but the soundtrack lets her down. It is ameteurish, unnecessry in most scenes and overly loud (silence would have been scarier). The whole movie would have had a better atmosphere without the confusing noises being constantly there. I thought the story was interesting but lost its way. It could have been quite spooky but the confusion aided by the soundtrack just let it drift a bit."
2,Two Stars-spoilers follow,"A wonderfully exciting movie where a woman wakes up to find her husband alive, the next day she learns he died only to wake up the day after that with him alive. Sandra Bullock stars as the wife determinded to figure out what is going on. It was an very exciting, edge of your seat movie that I couldn't wait to find out how it ended....until I saw the ending. Then it sucked. He died? Jim died? After all that he still dies? All the effort to change what happened was for nothing? I felt like I just wasted my time. The only reason for the two stars is Sandra Bullock and we at least got to see Julian McMahon with his shirt off."
3,Ground Hog Day,"Her husband's dead - or is he? Her daughter has a bloody accident, but when? She wakes up knowing her husband's dead, only to hear him in the shower. So what's going on with this poor woman? You'll have to watch this movie several times before you can figure it out, which I've never been able to do. Premonition is sort of the dark side of Ground Hog Day- deja vu all over again. Every character in it is without warmth, with the exception of the wife and kids. Whether or not anything psychic is going on, or merely a series of bad dreams, is never made clear. Interesting premise, otherwise a web of confusion. Just OK."
1,Don't bother with this one!,Convoluted and completely unbelievable story resulting in an absolutely stupid movie with a poor ending. Don't waste your time or money.
1,They Hoped We Wouldn't Notice.,"Rule 1. Don't use a cellphone while driving.Rule 2. Don't drop it on the floor.Rule 3. Don't pick it up while your car is in the path of a gas tanker.Sandra Bullock stars, but this movie lets her down. It's very good up until the last few minutes, when the Time Travel Paradox just doesn't work.Linda has a premonition of injury to her daughter and fatal crash for her husband Jim, and subsequent events over the rest of the week. She finally puts this all together the previous Sunday, but fails to take any action to prevent it. She ends up causing Jim's death (and the tanker driver's), then leaving the scene of the accident (the police can't find her till next day). For this, she's rewarded with all the money she'll ever need.Put like this, it sounds dumb. For some reason, that's not a problem in Hollywood."
1,Is this a remake of the J-horror movie?,"I'm sorry this is not a review, but I didn't know where else to ask. Is this a remake of the Japanese horror movie Premonition?"
2,Why No Stickers on the Glass?,"They're there...then they're gone. She knows it...she does nothing. The problem with this is that she ""sees"" what's to happen, then does the same things anyway. Sees pills...gets pills. Even dressing in the same blue shirt for a nightgown. DUH! Two stars awarded for the torture not lasting two hours!"
3,Works well with manual focus,"Whatever the description says about this teleconverter, it does not work with autofocus on Sony Alpha (300). It keeps on focusing but never gets focused when autofocus is on. But with manual focus, it works fine. You can still produce sharp and crisp pictures, depending on how you set up the exposure setting before shooting. Weak in low light situations. And remember, it reduces the aperture by two stops. This is a great catch! However, you work best with your camera and its accessories if you know their strengths and their limits. It applies for this teleconverter as well."
2,Not one of the best,My daugthers (1 and 2.5) are quite huge Barney fans but they don't seem to like this one quite as much. Some of the things they did - like using the computer to surf the WWW and the globe to visit other countries seemed to go over their head. There wasn't enough singing and dancing - too much talking! They enjoy seeing Barney's house and point all the wonderful things out to me but they always prefer to watch one of the other Barney videos we have with more singing and dancing.
5,My 24 month old sister can't get enough,"I bought my 24 month old sister this video a month ago and she has watched it at least once a day since. She asks for it all the time and she already sings along to most of the songs. There are a few parts she doesn't quite 'get' yet, but she is thoroughly entertained by it nonetheless. With the funny songs and skits, she enjoys singing along, looking for the puppy, making the sour pickle face, and dancing with the Rockers."
3,Too much Information for kids' to handle!!,"My brother recived this as a present last year. At the time he was two years old. (Now he is three.) The video is doing the imagining for the kids. The idea of Barny's house is cute but a lot of the information is too complicated for todlers to compute. The PBS Barney seris are a great influnce on kids. Generally the information is not too difficult to understand and as always,it convays the solid message to children.In this video, however there is a side plot of BJ and his friends trying to invent a new dance. Barney and friends go on the computer and get information about dancing and they use what they learn to invent a new dance. There are many songs and dances to do. This is a good video to watch two or three times, but it does not hold kids' interest like the other tapes do. Good Luck!:)"
3,A franchise that is really showing its age,"Simply put, what we have here is a once-charming franchise that is trying too hard to be relevant and maintain its appeal to earlier viewers who are now growing older. If Baby Bop is aggravating, the her brother B.J. borders on insufferable.Meanwhile there are only two kids. This may only be a personal preference on my 2-year-old's part, but she definitely responds better to Barney shows when the kids are doing the singing & dancing, rather than a gaggle of costumed dinosaurs. The whole program lumbers laboriously from gag to gag and fails to keep the child's interest, unlike earlier shows.The dialogue sounds more like it is aimed at 8-year-olds than the younger set. If I had an 8-year-old still watching Barney, I would be getting him professional help rather than getting this video. I'm glad we only checked it out from the library. Ugh."
2,Over Priced,"I checked this book out from the library, and yes it has some nice recipes but not for the asking price. The cover has a price of 19.95 why is everyone asking so much? Soap makers companion is just as good if not better.Soapmaker's Companion: A Comprehensive Guide with Recipes, Techniques & Know-How (Natural Body Series - The Natural Way to Enhance Your Life)I am an experienced soap maker and would never pay this much for a book like this. Basic soap recipes with some nice essential oil combinations but nothing you could not find on the internet for free. Basic Bath Bombs but again very basic and nothing you could not get on the internet search; many wholesale supplies have soap and bath recipes for no charge. All of the recipes on my website are from the Soap Makers Companion with the addition of many of my own ingredients (ideas) [...]"
5,Great price! Arrived as described.,"Was in better shape then expected. All parts and documentation sealed in original packaging. Works like a champ, although charger only works with batteries provided (if youi planned on using your own AA batteries)."
2,Not what was indicated,This Midland AVP4 battery charger package was sold and indicated to go with the Midland NTVP1 Nautico VHF radio but: THEY DON;T WORK TOGETHER!!! While the batteries are the correct size the charging cradle will only work with a diffecent model. I was able to get the spare batteries to charge by placing them in the charging cradle and wedging a piece of foam to hold the batteries in place. Don't trust some of Amazon's claims that products suggested to sell together actually go together. I wasted my money on the charger.
1,midland chargers,"unfortunately the extra chargers, which were shipped along with the radios, were the wrong ones. fortunately these were just extra chargers. The chargers that were inside the radio packs worked just fine. It would be nice if the packers ensure that the extra chargers fit the radios shipped. Now I am have several chargers that I cannot use. I was about to double my order when I noticed this. This will cause a delay in future orders from me."
1,not that what i need,not that what i need.and i go to ups because i need return it.i'm waiting for return and waiting for my many.thanks
1,Not for use in all midland radios,"Just because the battery works with most midway radios, the charger does not. The battery fits my radios just find, but the charger is for radios whose charging terminals are on the rear, not the bottom of the units."
5,thanks,they work great thanks-no battery changing-now we can go out and play and come back and not worry about batterys
3,"Not really a ""Best of"" but...","I bought this DVD set 3 years ago and to be honest I was disappointed by most episodes. Cold Case Files is a great show and I can't believe that this is the best list they could came up with.The best episodes are by far The Zodiac Killer and The Green River Killer, both of them are 45 minutes long and are very interesting, very well done. Other cases like ""Killer in the County"" and ""The Weepy-Voiced Killer"" are also very interesting. If you are a real fan of documentaries about True Crimes/Real life mysteries then go ahead, buy this DVD, for less than 20$ it's a good buy, but this could have been so much better. Good, but Disappointing."
3,Wrong cold case,I thought I was recieving the show with the blonde actress not this! It was interesting to see the stories and I liked them
5,A great series based on true stories.,"This is the series that started me on my interest in this type of tv show. Bill Curtiss was the narrator in many of these cases & that is also how I became familar with him. The series is based on cases that have gone cold, sometimes for many many years. Yet, after alot of work by Cold Case Dectives from around the country they are solved. Great!"
4,Serial killers: human only by coincidence of birth,"It's no revelation, but after watching the ten chapters of Bill Kurtis's COLD CASE FILES - The Most Infamous Cases, the viewer is impressed with how alien these murderers really are, how uncaring and detached from humanity.One who slaughtered over 40 women, the Green River Killer, returned repeatedly to where he dumped the bodies so he could have sex with them, and did so even when they were crawling with maggots. The Zodiac Killer, who's never been apprehended, craved notoriety. He taunted police and newspaper reporters with written comments on his scores and next-intended targets.And yet there's the Weepy-Voiced Killer, who called 911 after each attack to cry hysterically over the horrible things he'd done. Oddly, out of all ten profiled here, it's said that THIS particular man was mentally ill! Conclusion: a serial killer has GOT to be crazy if he's truly remorseful or begs to be caught."
5,Unchallenged overview,"This book really provides state of the art publications on Internationalisation perspectives. The background of the book is a conference celebrating Professor Jan Johanson, a leading figure within the field. In a well-organized structure the reader is presented with well-written work by researchers from most of the World on the topic of internationalization. This is a must read for a Ph.D-student or ambitious Master's student within the field of International Business!"
4,99% perfect!,"Good guide! The appearance ratio charts are really helpful, instead of bopping down ""Common"" or ""Rare.""The Pokemon Profiles are pretty good too, telling you to catch it or not.But sometimes Skarmory was spelt ""Skarmony.""Maybe because when the author first saw the book, the ""r"" looked more like an ""n!"""
5,Can it be more plain....,Reading this book gives pause to the direction many are going in the times in which we live. To evaluate our position as Christians we sometimes need to read and see through the thoughts of others and their actions to examine ourselves. This is a must read in a time of confusion. Crystal Clear
1,Magic by Tami Hoag,"A disappointment. Not up to the standards of her other books. Very thin plot, no conflict, just two fantastically beautiful people finding fantastic sex (on every other page), and raking their hands thru their wild manes of hair. The mane raking is found in all her books, but those all have interesting plots. She is good with words, but would be more interesting if all the women weren't goddesses, and all the men sexy supermen. Gets a little old."
5,"Not bad for an early work, an easy read","I am surprised so many people said so many bad things about MAGIC by Hoag. This is one of her early works that I read when it was first published years and years ago. I liked it then and I like it now since I re-read it. No, its not an in-depth mystery, suspense romance. But for what it is, just an easy enjoyable read, it is a very good story. There is mystery with bad guys and a ghost and some romance. This book is well worth reading."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,I just finished Ms. Hoag's book Ashes to Ashes and loved it so I thought I would try some of her other books. Despite the reviews I picked up a second hand copy just to see if what the previous reviewers thought was true. Lets face it so many people can't be wrong. This book was hard to finish and hard to understand why it was written. The storyline seemed contrived and there was not an drop of magic to be found. This story had so much more potential and I just wish some more time was taken in the writting process. Don't let this turn you away from Ms. Hoag her later stories are still very good.
1,Beware..do not waste your time and money,"Sorry, I swear I am not a negative person but this book really was horrible! I quickly picked this up (I was with my husband, he HATES to shop!) and from the back cover looked pretty interesting. I got to page 115 and could not force myself to read it anymore! I just hate to throw money away and tried to keep an open mind hoping the book would start making some sense! The main characters are horrible! I have read several bad reviews about books that I have really liked in the past that I did not agree with at all, but anyone thinking of reading this book, the reviews are RIGHT ON THE MONEY! It will be an investment you will definitely regret"
2,a big disappointment,"I read a novel by T. Hoag called Guilty as Sin and that book was great! I thought I would read a similar one, but ... unfortunately this was a very ordinary and simple romance novel. Not much to say about the contents. Man meets woman, he likes her, she likes him, some minor problems arise and they find each other.... what's new?. Sorry, not much more to tell, no suprising turns in the novel a straightforward and very predictable book."
3,Just OK,"I loved Keeping Company, Heart of Gold and Reilly's Return, so when I found this book, and saw it was Bryan, I thought it'd be just as great as the others. Not so. This book was sort of boring, and there was no spark between the main characters. I only finished this book to see what the other characters were up to and what happened to them. I do adore Tami Hoag's books but this one, ahh, well we'll leave it at that."
1,Do not waste your money!,"Sorry, I swear I am not a negative person but this book really was horrible!

1,juvenile,Magic was for lovelorn teenagers and someone with a limited I.Q. Her later mysteries are fun.I guess you have to start somewhere. Terrible waste of money. Has grown from her earlybook. Thank Heavens. No more bodice rippers Tami!
5,"GET IT, GET IT, GET IT!","This is one of the most under rated of musical gems to come out.And It's not always easy to find. There are several differnt groups playing Son on here.... all awesome.My favorite cut is: ""Como Esta Miguel"" ... truly sublime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT MISS THIS...... especially at under $10.00 !!!!!!!!Mark / silverspurr"
1,Nice gift if it worked,"This would have been a great gift but the one wheel wouldn't work so i had to send it back to the company and they didn't have any more to replace it. So now i'm left with trying to find another, which is very difficult at this time of year.Thank you, D Dubrasky"
2,Changed words,"I liked the music however all the lyrics were changed to well known songs, which quite didn't do it for me. Oh well overall it is decent."
5,Perception,"Being an artist, I am not in the typical work environment and still have found this book extremely useful in my career. I have noticed a major difference on how my clients perceive me. I have gone from the image of ""starving artist"" to ""successful artist"" when engaging with my clients and my business has reflected that. Who doesn't want to hire someone that is successful?"
3,What about the Low Wage Worker?,"Casual Power is a crisply written, accessible book. Two key themes motivate the advice: 1) it is good to get ahead in corporate America; 2) you--whoever you are--can do this with the right look achieved through careful planning following the suggested steps. The book shows that ""biz casual"" is really not very casual at all; it is another test of one's sensitivity to the unwritten codes of the corporate environment. The actual fashion advice here, however, differs little from other books on dress written in the last ten years, and lacks the creativity and the humor of the Chic Simple series. I read this book after reading the book on low wage living, Nickled and Dimed by Barbara Ehrenreich. I would be curious to see if Sherry could help someone in that economic bracket. How could someone on minimum wage--the custodian in Sherry's vaunted corporation--make a commitment to buy one good piece of clothing per month? How can s/he buy any clothing 12 times a year?"
5,The Best in its Field,"I am an image consultant. I give seminars and workshops for corporations on the importance of appearance and corporate protocol in the business world. One of my major seminars deals with the problem of looking like a professional in a dressed-down world. Sherry's book is the best I have ever read on the subject. In fact, it is so good that I am using it in all my seminars as a textbook. And I have given it as a gift to all my private clients as well. The book is clear, crisp and utterly professional. It has wonderful illustrations and clear explanations for the psychology behind color and style. And it gives excellent guidelines for dressing well at every level of business dressing whether dot.com casual or more traditional and conservative. I couldn't recommend it more highly, except to say I wish I had written it myself. Adele Riepe, Image Solutions, New York"
3,Walt Phillips 4 Dvd Box Set,"Im So Used To Watching Bruce Brown Surf Films So It Was Nice To Switch It Up And See What Other Independent Surf Directors Where Doing, The Walt Phillips Collection Was A Good Pick, Lot's Of Classic Surf Footage From The Early Days! As You Would Expect When Purchasing Late 50s Early 60's Surf Films!My Favorite Of The 4 Films Is ""Psych Out"" Because About 40 Out Of The 50 Minutes Of The Movie Is The Original Narration And Includes Some Great Instrumental Surf/Pre Surf Music! The Other Films Are Good With The Newer Narrations, But I Prefer To Hear It As It Was Originally Done, And The Music On The Other Films Is Really Bad!All In All, A Good Purchase If You've Got A Craving For The Original Surf Films!"
4,Great Deal!,"If you're a longboarder, you'll love these old flicks filled with all the usual suspects. For the price, you can't go wrong (unless they've jacked it up to 50 bucks or something)"
3,"OK videos, not great","I like surfing and I like history, so these videos seemed like a good idea. They're OK, with some good waves and surfers from 50 years ago. Not quite the same quality as Bruce Brown's or Greg Noll's work from the same general era, however."
1,Missing important pages!,"I had read this very engaging page turner of a book, which tells an amazing survival story of travel at sea in some of the roughest waters in the world. I bought the book as a gift for my sister, and many important pages were missing in the last few chapters---ruining the true story. (The copy I had read belonged to a friend who knew the author, and was therefore complete.)"
3,Spaces too large for me.,"If you're looking for intricate patterns to color, this book isn't it. It isn't very interesting, and the designs are too large, and spaced far apart. I like to color because the repetitive, detailed coloring helps me de-stress. This book is more for general coloring for kids, it wasn't what I wanted or expected."
4,Worth it for just one song,"I've always loved the sound of Bette Midlers voice, but bought this CD specifically for the song ""My One True Friend."" I had such a hard time trying to find this song because it is not included on the movie soundtrack. I was thrilled to find a used copy of Bathhouse Betty so that I wouldn't have to pay full price for a new CD. There are several good songs on this CD, although I must admit I don't really care for all of them. ""My One True Friend"" is such a beautiful song that I feel it makes it well worth the price I paid for the entire CD. I give this one four stars."
5,Very genuine Bette.,"This collection represents what's best about Bette Midler--her ability to entertain and touch our hearts at the same time. Her song ""I'm Beautiful"" seems to be just a perky, happy, ""feel good"" song until you listen--then you find it's a song about self esteem and self pride. After all, we're all ""beautiful dammit."" Other songs of note are all the ballads, especially ""Lullaby in Blue."" This is the CD that shows once again, the heart of Bette."
4,Don't believe the hype!!,"Although ""Bathhouse Betty"" is for the most part an astounding album, the hype that it received as a return to her roots as a bathhouse singer really wasn't accurate in my opinion. The attitude was there, but I personally felt as though her anthem ""I'm Beautiful"" and ""Big Socks"" were simply too over-produced. The raw, flamboyant nature of her early days simply isn't there anymore. As a torch singer, no one shines like Bette, and I have so much respect for her as an artist, but I think that maybe she has matured too much, or, perhaps I simply missed the boat."
5,Bette is Back and Bette-r Than Ever,"This album is remarkable... I have made all of my friends listen to it because it has a wonderful message... everybody isn't perfect... so lets have fun!!! Bette Midler is one of the most influential artist in the entertainment industry and it really shows with ""Bathhouse Betty"" (her 17th recording). The song that Bette seems to have a blast with is ""I'm Beautiful"" and seems to have the least fun with ""Boxing"" (but somehow makes the song tasteful). The mix of songs on this recording is diverse and wonderful. From the ballads ""Thats How Love Moves"", ""Lullaby in Blue"" and ""My One True Friend"" to her happy-message filled tunes ""I'm Hip"", ""One Monkey Don't Stop No Show"" and ""Big Socks"" everything runs smoothly and makes you want more. To bad there aren't more samples of Bettes amazing talent for all of us to admire... I can not wait for the next one!!"
5,Lush! Hip! Swinging! The Divine Miss M Returns To Her Roots!,"Bette sings lush ballads with her trademark melodic voice superbly. She sings hip rap and swinging blues with a gusto missing on her last album. Fans of the Divine one will be in rapture! Everything we love about Miss M is here! SASSY! BRASSY! And BEAUTIFUL, DAMMIT!!"
4,"Midler magic. And finally ""I Sold My Heart..."" classic.","An elclectic combination of songs. From heartwarming ballads,""My One True Friend"" written byCarole Bayer Sager & David Foster.To the Patti Labelle classic she's beeen singing for years! Hopefully there are plans for Dance remixes. She went to #2 with ""To Deserve You"" remix, Now let's go to #1."
4,Very eclectic,"This is Bette Midler at her most eclectic. Beautiful ballads like ""Song of Bernadette"" and ""My One True Friend"" to strange offerings like ""I'm Beautiful"" and ""I'm Hip"". My favourite though is the fun ""Ukelele Lady"" with its old-time fun. This album is a fun offering from Bette...some people though will not like it as shown by previous reviews, but if you enjoy albums with a unique array of songs I'm sure you will like this one too. The 12 page booket comes with all lyrics and a few photos."
5,Simpy Fabulous!! Bette you out did yourself.,"When I bought this CD i wasn't expecting Miss M to out do the her Some Poeples Lives album, but much to my amazment she did. I recommend this cd to everyone who wants to laugh, fall in love or just to sit down and have a good cry. The Devine Miss M if by some chance you can do it again please by all means do so. Your fans will be waiting patiently for it. Thank you for a FABULOUS RETURN to the roots of the Devine Miss M."
5,EXCELLENT,"IF YOU LIKE BETTE MIDLER, YOU'LL REALLY LIKE THIS CD, BUT IF YOUR LIKE ME AND NEVER HEARD HER BEFORE YOU'LL STILL LIKE IT! THE SONGS ""BIG SOCKS"" ""I'M BEAUTIFUL"" AND ""UKELELE LADY"" ARE THE BOMB."
1,Huge disappointment,"Bette's latest is a huge disappointment. Starting off with her terrible rendering of Jennifer Warnes beautiful ""Song of Bernadette"". It seems to me that Bette was trying to mimic Jennifer's vocalizing, unfortunately this was done badly. Bette would have done better to just kick back and sing the song her own way, (as she did with Dylan's ""I Shall Be Released"" on her concert album ""Divine Madness"".) The rest of the tracks are not much better, what I consider to be mixed bag of ballad wannabes and old vaudeville songs. I've been under the impression for some time that Bette should dump Arif Mardin as a producer and get back to what she does best - performing great songs and making them her own. I'm just thankful that I checked this cd out from my local library before plucking down and wasting fifteen bucks. Come on Bette! You can do so much better."
2,Bette all the time,"This album will sure become the most treasured of them all. It features songs Bette used to sing when she started her career in the NY and San Francisco gay bathouses. It is a real treasure,and pure fun. 'Song of Bernadette' is the most moving,as also my favourite 'My one true friend' Bette put her best into this album."
3,LOVED IT....BOMBED ON A FEW,"This was my first Bette Midler CD that I have purchased so I can't say I'm a devoted fan.., but I do enjoy her hits..""The Rose"" and ""The Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"" being two of them. I absolutely fell in love with her rendition of Ukulele Lady(and who can do a 1925 song better than the Divine Miss M?) and the fun ""One Monkey Don't Stop No Show""...I did think that ""Big Socks"" and ""I'm Beautiful"" were a little overboard and didn't blend with the rest of the album. I guess some dedicated Bette fans will argue that those songs just prove that she can do a wide variety of songs and do them well...me give me her old fashioned love ballads anytime, that's what I think she does best!"
3,"Bette Midler is the best, but this is not her best","Sorry to be a dissenter, but in my opinion this is not a great album. Bette Midler has the best range and spirit of any female vocalist alive today, but she wastes her talents on rap music and ho-hum melodies on this recording. One listen is all I gave this CD. Into the used bins it goes!"
2,Great talent- so so recording artist,"If you think Midler has been making great albums all these years, you'll be happy. If you like her live but don't like the discs, this won't change things. Eclectic or unfocused? I'd say the latter. By the way, despite what someone else wrote here, ""I sold my heart to the junkman"" was quite popular long before Patti LaBelle."
2,Disappointing,I was prepared to love this CD after reading great reviews...but I was disappointed in almost every cut. I guess my expectations were way out of line.
1,A major disappointment...,"I bought this CD with the belief that it had to be good...even if I didn't know any of the songs. (It also helped that the reviews have been nothing less than stellar.) I think this is bad stuff...hey, I love the early Bette, too...but this is no ""Divine Miss M."" Also, on some tracks, Bette sounds like the child of Sandra Bernhardt crossed with the Spice Girls. Maybe I'm getting too old, but I'll stick to ""Bette of Roses"" and the very first albums."
3,Hawaian Bette,"One of my favs showing the true ""Miss Divine"" personified. If you love Bette & her particularly style. This is one for the collection... Fun & beautiful soulfood."
4,VERY GOOD,"I remember reading a quote from Bette that said her previous record company thought that her last album lacked humor and they missed that. She gets back to basics on ""Bathhouse Betty"". ""Big Socks"" is funny and funky at the same time. ""Laughing Matters"" is a nice play on words. Implying that humor is important to get thru the day in this ""effed up"" world. (My words not hers.) ""Song of Bernadette"" is also a hark back to when Bette would do songs from important song writers. In this case Leonard Cohen. I think the only mis-step is the sappy ""One True Friend"". Check this one out. Worth the money!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Bette R than I thought!,"I stumbled upon this cd after buying her Clooney tribute cd. WOW! She has a great voice and something Mariah, Whitney, Dion, Gloria, and Madonna all lack: A SENSE OF HUMOR. Some of these songs are just hysterical. Thanks lady, for making a cd different from all the rest. No wonder you've lasted so many years!"
5,They work every time!,"They work every time. But this is my first experience with pin nailing, so I have nothing to compare them to.I also bought an awesome Nikle pin nailer, so that could have something to do with my success!"
4,Band-Aid Johnson & Johnson Flexible Fabric,"The fabric is nice because it is durable. Only problem is it sometimes leaves behind adhesive residue, but not as much as some plastic ones. Of course it retains water from washing hands. Fraying of the fabric on the edges occurs soon after applied."
5,As It Should Be,Not much to say about a Band-Aid but I only purchase Johnson & Johnson Band-Aids as I have poor experience with other brands.
5,Costly Band-aids,The product is GREAT -- however - I found exactly the same thing at my local Walmart CHEAPER!! My BAD!!!
5,"Band Aids, Johnson & Johnson","These are great to have on hand. They are a full one inch wide, and stay put! Yet, they come off easily. I have given so many small bandages away; they are useless. I want the gauze full bandage, and this is it! The box of 100 means we won't run out. The price was very good, and the product is exactly what we were looking for."
5,Quantity and quality.,Good quality. Reasonably priced. Great to have a large number of band-aids on hand. What more can you say about a band-aid - it stick and does the job.
3,Careful What You Order,"This review is not about the Flexible Fabric Band-Aid. I have been using the 1x3 inch Fabric Band-Aids for years, and order them by the 100-count box. It's a good product.The product offered here by Pharmapacks and othersBand-Aid Johnson & Johnson Band-Aid, Flexible Fabric, 100-Count Boxesis the 3/4 x 3 inch version. The images are poor, and the product description is as follows: ""Product Dimensions: 6 x 5 x 4 inches ; 2.4 ounces"". Clearly that is not the case. I ordered 3 boxes based on the reviews that mention a 1x3 Band-Aid. Pharmapacks stoutly defends sending the smaller product, so I'm stuck.The moral of the story is: If the seller can't provide a clear image and description of the product, don't buy it. Getting the wrong product is your fault (and expense), not theirs."
4,I love the sonnet,"I love the sonnet, so I was happy to see a book of poems, especially by such a skilled formalist as Baer (see his first book, The Unfortunates, which is one of my favorites) take on the form. He handles it with skill and grace. There are many, many strong sonnets here (""Centurion"" is my favorite though). Like the other reviewer though, I do agree that the translations leave something to be desired. But the original compositions pop. And look at that cover drawing..."
4,Good Teaching,"This book really helped me learn what poetry is. The language and history of poetry. If you are a poet and want to learn how to deliver it more efeectively, please read this book. Michael Bujega knows his stuff!!Healing Connection: Poems and Psalms that Heal the Soul"
5,Dailly Readings from Your Best Life,I think Joel Osteen's writings are a gift from God! I read this book one part a day and find it to hit the perfect spot in my life. I highly recommend this book to everyone!
3,devotions,It is an interesting and helpful read. I found it was a good way to relax and start the day.
5,Great Book!,"This is a great book if you don't have the time to read Your Best Life Now or you want to supplement the original book. It has 90 days' worth of a way to read the Bible, along with Joel's interpretations. If you are a Joel Osteen fan and, especially if you follow his talks and church, I recommend buying the book. He is a very uplifting fellow and tells you that God wants you to live Your Best Life Now and how to do it!"
1,Boring,"Joel Osteen at first simply bored me as a I read through his first few devotions. Devoid of any fresh thought, they were trite and very similar to each other. After a few more readings (I give every book a chance.), I thoroughly hated this book. Osteen is self-satisfied and dull. His book not only added nothing to my life, I feel like it detracted from it. Do not waste your time on this one."
1,Not what I expected.,"We were not allowed to see the inside of this book before ordering. Had I been able to do that, I'd not have ordered it. The size of this book is 7.5 X 8.0 inches and only 1/8 inch thick. The information within is minimal. I was hoping for more detail in how to layout a drawing for the human body for the Junior High School art student. I should have ordered a used one for 67 cents, but I will keep it because it was cheap enough. To date, I have not seen a really good book on how to layout a drawing of the human body, which includes bone and muscle structure."
2,Oh nO! I paid [money]!,"I tend to agree,somewhat,with the last reviewer.I can teach myself to draw faces and figures in an easier way.This was kind of useless.Thank goodness it was really cheap.When will I ceise to be disappointed by these how to draw books????"
1,it really bad. It didn't help me at all.,THIS WHOLE BOOK WAS VERY BAD THAT I THINK I'M GOING TO THROWUP FROM THE HORRID STENCH OF NO SKILL THAT THIS AUTHOR HAS.
3,Good music... if you can play it.,"The title track in particular is awesome. But, due to some form of so-called ""COPY CONTROL SYSTEM"" that EMI has placed on the disc, this CD won't play in my home stereo or my car.My computer, on the other hand, has NO trouble with it. So I guess I should rip it and make a copy to play on stereo and in the car?!!? Makes absolutely no sense to me. I'd give this five stars without the copy control.Good music. If you can play it."
2,too average,"After I listend to his amazing singles like 'maison', 'Doo Uap...', I totally became a big fan of him. his job WAS great and unique.so I bought this album with no hesitate.but I found all the music in this is too average...just normally mixed with some jazz singers."
5,A Great Journal,"I received this journal as a present and I am incredibly pleased with it. It is not leather, but it is very realistic looking, and beautiful. It is inlaid with an elaborate gold hand tooled pattern around the edges. It is also embossed both front and back with a similar pattern which is not gold laid. The quality of the pages inside of the book is quite exceptional. They are thick, and won't stain through. They are lined with a very light grey, that will not be greatly noticeable after you've written in it. It also has a beautiful red ribbon to keep your place as you write your way through it. In the back there is a really nice cloth pouch for keeping paper or maybe a photograph or two. In all it is an exceptional book, which I would highly recommend."
5,Note Book with a Good look,This was a brilliant product. My grandson absolutely loved it. His school pals were impressed. Such a good idea to have a notebook that looks good.
3,Put a muzzle on it!,"This is a nice muzzle, BUT, its hard to know what size to get for a dog. We had a puppy and the sizes were hard to differentiate when ordering. This lightweight dog muzzle is ok, not sure if i would reccomend it or not, unless you were able to get the exact size you need!"
3,OK but nothing special,"I recommend ""When Giants Roamed the Earth"" over this piece. You do get to watch some trains but I prefer the historical development of steam trains."
5,The History of American Railroads: The Years of Steam (2007),This is on of the most informative videos (DVD) I have ever seenon the history of railroads especially The American steam locomotive.If your going to buy any video on railroads or locomotives from the1940's to the 1970's then this is the one.Mike
5,"For what it is, it is",I like listening to smooth jazz on long road trips and this fills the bill with a pleasant collection that makes the miles effortlessly pass by...
2,Great concept...poor execution,"Many movies attempt to deal with the concept of redemption. Its a common theme. It is a subject we can all relate to. So, while this movie has a fine cast and a good concept, this movie is poorly edited and overly long."
5,Great movie!,I was very hesitant to watch this movie but was pleasantly surprised to discover that it was not the typical junk that Hollywood has been producing lately. I highly recommend this movie!
2,Pay it Forward,"Either I'm dumber than I thought (so much for all those degrees) or this movie was constructed, scripted and edited so poorly that even I could not be rescued from the labyrinth of confusion. It took a somewhat boring 45 minutes until I was starting to feel confident that I knew what was going on. Combine that with another 30 minutes of implausible events and mediocre acting by all but Mr. Smith which then sets the stage for the implausible emotional ending. I suggest watch the much better ""Pay it Forward"" if you want to see a nicely developed moral and emotional story."
1,The message of this movie sucks,"I was so angry after viewing this movie. It is as though the message of this movie is, ""It's okay to kill yourself as long as you do something good with your body parts,"" oh and, ""It's okay to meet the person first who will kill himself and THEN have his body parts set aside just for you."" Are you kidding me!!!!!!!"
3,seven pounds...,A sad movie about tragedy being made righted....NOT. I wanted to like this movie but the ending was just way too bad for me to recommend to ANYONE.
2,"Great premise, poor execution.","Emotionally forced and very predictable. Not Will Smith's best work. My wife and I could see the ending coming from a mile away, and just really am very disappointed with the spoiled potential of this movie. Great acting, but piss poor plot, that had me hoping for so much more."
1,Not what I expected from Will Smith,***SPOILER ALERT***This movie is HORRID!Being a Will Smith fan I thought this movie would be GREAT! I was sorely disappointed!The story was full of factual impossibilities and I did NOT think the main character was selfless or brave...he was an idiot. If someone died in that way all his organs would have been useless...also if he died of suicide they couldn't use his organs anyhow. A little research could have saved a LOT of time and effort.It could have been a really good movie and it was trash. Don't waste your money.
3,Misses the Mark,"This movie could have been a great movie, but it missed the mark. I was really looking forward to it after seeing the preview and hearing Will Smith talk about the movie on Oprah. Unfortunately, it was slow going, depressing and could have been done a lot better. The actors were great, but I think the writing and directing could have been better. I usually love Will Smith in movies, but this one was disappointing."
2,Redemption Lost,"In the end, a heart-wrenching tale after periods of almost intolerable dullness. This slow moving film ended up being a good mystery but ultimately was dissatisfying. It is about a man trying to gain redemption who does so in an utterly inappropriate way and in the end loses his dignity. Crying at the end does not make this a worthy film."
5,Fabulous movie-unexpected twist,I recommend you watch this movie without knowing what whole plot is about.I find this movie one of the most romantic movies EVER when it comes to extreme sacrifice of love and forgiveness.Will Smith and the other actors are primo!
4,Heartwarming,I loved the content of the movie and how the actor was trying to make-up for his loss by bringing happiness to others.
5,Life-changing!,"This movie is wonderfully moving. Our son watched it and told us we had to see it, and he was right. I'd suggest it to anyone!"
5,WOW! One of the best moving movies out there,"When I saw this movie I had no idea what it was about. We were supposed to see a different movie; however it was sold out. That is how we saw Seven Pounds. I was a fan of the show Fresh Prince of BelAir. I love Will Smith in almost evrrything he does, so I figured I would like this movie. This is one of his best performances. At the end you are just shocked. Very touching, tender and sensitive. I highly recommend this movie."
2,Bad Screenplay,"Classic example of an interesting idea ruined by poor execution. Had the story been told in a linear way, with the audience aware of what's going on from the beginning, this movie could have been much more effective and powerful. Instead, by being purposely obtuse and overwrought, this movie is 100% DOA. I'm sure it was intended as Oscar fodder for Will Smith. But a script that plays the shell game instead of giving you the story straight is usually suspect of being shallow, and this one is about as deep as a kiddy pool. Strictly for those moved by Hallmark commercials and Oprah Book-of-the-Month picks. For the rest of us, this is a clumsy, self-indulgent misfire."
1,A Trip Through Horror Land,"This movie is the most horrible movie I have ever seen.There was only one scene, that touched me. However, the movie is so horrid that it robs your life of any joy.I would not recommend this film to my worst enemy."
2,VERY BORING MOVIE!,"I SAW THE MOVIE TRAILER FOR 7 POUNDS, AND IT SAID THAT THE MOVIE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A LOVE STORY. I DONT CONSIDER THIS MOVIE A LOVE STORY AT ALL. WILL SMITH KEPT MAKING FUNNY FACIAL EXPRESSIONS THROUGH OUT THE MOVIE, WHICH MADE IT HARD FOR ME TO TAKE HIS DRAMATIC CHARACTER SERIOUSLY. THE MOVIE TOOK TO LONG TO START MAKING SINCE. THE MOVIE WAS VERY FICTIONAL AND NOT MOTIVATIONAL. I WOULD RECOMMENED ONLY SEEING THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVE TIME TO KILL OR SOMEONE GIVE IT TO YOU. WILL SMITH CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS."
1,Inceredibly Stupid,"This has to rate as the dumbest movie ever. It was bad I thought it was a movie done by an earlier Will Smith. To be honest, it sure didn't look like him in the movie. So slow, so sullen, what strange camera work. Beyond believable and so nasty! A complete waste of movie time in my opinion."
2,What's the point? Skip this movie,"1. Ok, this isn't a terrible movie. In fact, like most Will Smith movies--> it's well acted etc...2. Before I make my main statement, I know that movies are entertainment and that most are pure fiction. But after watching this movie, the main thought that ran through my mind was ""What's the point of this stupid movie? It's so unrealistic!"" The main premise of the movie is so far fetched, that one can't even suspend reality in one's mind to enjoy the movie.3. Thus bottomline: good acting but the storyline was so far out there that it inhibited me from enjoying the film."
3,Took a while.,"Confusing in the beginning, and the movie took a while to unpack. Did not find myself enjoying the movie until about mid-way. Although normally I'm a Will Smith fan, I found this role to be a little outside his range. The emotional aspect of his role seemed a little forced and flat. In short, there were several instances where I was cognizant of the fact he was acting. Normally he has me 'hook line and sinker'."
5,Seven Pounds DVD,"I'm a big fan of Will Smith anyway and this movie will definitely make you think about your purpose in this life.Very moving, very meaningful and extremely deep....God Bless Will Smith for making it."
5,Should've won awards,It is a fantastic movie. I have no idea why it didn't win any awards. It kept me wondering until they let you in at the end.
5,Awe Inspiring Movie,this movie really impacted me and I rank it as one of my top 3 favorites of all time. will smith is definatly one of the most talented actors in the feild and I applaud him for choosing movies that have substance.this movie is a testament to the power of humanity how one person has the power change so many lives for the better. the plot is brilliant and told in a way that leaves you savoring every scene.I give this movie the highest rating that I could give it deserves an oscar and i'm sure it will get several.a must see for anyone who seeks a movie that will stimulate your intellect and will leave you Awe struck long after the credits roll.In light of all the superficial CGI films & warmed over remakes we are bombarded with. Seven Pounds should set the standard for hollywood this what the public wants more of.
3,One man's path to redemption,"Ben Thomas lives a lonely life. His life has a cloud over him and it weights heavily on him. It is only his sad eyes that are telling us that there is something torturous going on inside his soul.We learn that Ben was involved in a car accident that killed 7 people, one including his wife. He was the only survivor of the crash. Over the years he is trying to make sense of it all and find way to redeem himself from the guilt he carries around. He finds kind and deserving people in need for organ donor that will save their life. He donates his lung, part of his liver and bone marrow. But his lack of desire to live in a life with guilt and no one to love forces him to make one final choice that will save lives of many others.Film is disjointed at times and Ben's affair with one of his candidates for organ donation is over the top. But the overall idea for the film is noble."
5,Tear-Jerker,"I was thoroughly confused through the majority of this movie, but if you stay with it, the end brings everything together. It ended up being a favorite of mine & Will Smith was just wonderful in the title role. He made me believe everything he was going through."
1,Seven Pounds Worth Less Than 1c/lb,"This is quite possibly one of the worst films ever written. The production of the movie was great but the idea of a guy who tries to redeem himself by donating his own organs to needy reciepients is ridiculous. This character commits suicide to donate his last two ""gifts."" His system of deciding who gets an organ is based on his perception of the reciepients worthiness. So what's the message? Should we start clearing out the prisons by euthanizing inmates and give their organs to reciepients society judges to be worty? And what standard do we use in judging who lives and who dies? I wish I had not wasted the $5 on this poorly written movie."
2,Unmemorable,"What is with contemporary Hollywood and there stretched out films? Would the movie had not been worse and its characters less believable if it was an hour thirty-forty five minutes?Anyways, nothing about these people he helped lead me to believe that they were above average people, worthy of his tribute. They were everyday people which would have been fine if set up like that but they weren't. Someone compared this to ""pay it forward"" except pay it forward is a more believable and a way more entertaining movie. This move came close to melodrama many times. And for to long it was set up like a suspense/mystery type of movie. Seems the only people who liked this movie are Will Smith fans who don't want to discern the actor from the movie."
1,SMITH IS OUT OF HIS ELEMENT HERE,"I first saw Will Smith in 1990 in his video ""Parents Just Don't Understand"". I told my recording artist husband ""This kid has great charisma. Watch him - he's going to be a star."" I'm rarely wrong in my predictions - I've only seen three artists with true charisma. Smith proved me right BUT he is beginning to take himself way too seriously recently. This is an incredibly depressing film on its face but one can learn from it and, hopefully, grow from this character's experience. The problem with Smith in the role is that he is still fundamentally a comedic actor. He can play drama but he is hardly dramatic. He is poorly cast here. In addition, his character is neither believeable or sympathetic. Two thumbs down!"
2,DVD PURCHASE OF SEVEN POUNDS,DVD arrived in reasonable time. It didn't work until I cleaned it. The mailing price was thirty per cent higher on original postage. The selling price was very good. I would buy again from this seller.
4,Bizarre but Good,Apart from guessing the plot correctly about 10 minutes into the movie this was still very entertaining - I only could not figure out the importance of the box jellyfish but that became abundantly clear near the end. The meeting at the end between heart defect girlfriend and blind piano playing is sappy but touching. Watch the movie.
2,Disappointed,The storyline was a great idea but I thought the movie was not very good at all. It seemed to drag on and on....
5,Emotional & Thought Provoking Movie,"Normally I am not a fan of Will Smith's movies, but something about the previews made me want to see this movie and I am so glad I did. I have to say that I believe Mr. Smith gave a wonderful performance in this movie and so I purchased it. Some might find the movie sad, but I believe the movie is a passionate portrayal of someone seeking redemption by truly giving of himself when he has taken so much. Every time I watch this movie it makes an impact, which is the mark of a great movie. I don't want to say to much about the story as I do not want to spoil this movie for someone who hasn't seen it. But if you're on the fence post about this film, give it a watch."
4,Hound Front Carrier,"We have two small dogs (they weight less than 7 lbs.), so we ordered two of the Carriers. The quality, design and features were great. However, we have had to reorder the medium as the small size did not properly fit our dogs even though it says up to 10lbs.Awaiting for the new order to come in."
4,Kyjen Outward Hound Front carrier (small black),I like the carrier but the other reviewers are right unless your dog is a small puppy or very very short in length they will have to sit up all the time while in the carrier.If you want to use a blanket and have your dog lay down it will not work. My dog is 6 lbs with a small frame and she only ever wants to sit up so she loves it so the small size carrier works for us. Most dogs probably need the medium size for more versatility. So far it does not fold in as the other reviewers have reported so I have no complaints.I do not think a 10 lb dog would fit in the small it would be so uncomfortable for them it would be ridiculous.So for about $4 or $5 more you can get the medium and avoid a return.
2,small is small,"it seemed like a good deal but the small was too small for a small dog. it should be labeled ""tiny"". it may have worked if there were holes in the pack for the legs to come out."
4,Great Carrier,"I ordered this carrier for my 7 lb. toy poodle. It's kind of iffy whether or not it's too small. At first I felt it was because his front legs were hanging out the top, but by the time we got home from out bike ride he was all snuggled down inside with just his head hanging out. I will definitely use it, but I'm going to try the medium just in case."
1,disappointed,"Hated this medium size carrier for my 7.9 pound Chihuahua. The construction was flimsy. Might be a great carrier for a much smaller, lighter pooch that needs little support."
1,Cheap construction - disappointing,"Although this product claims to hold dogs up to 20 pounds, I don't think a dog any bigger than 10 pounds could fit comfortably in this carrier. The bottom of the carrier is merely made of foam, so it does not give the dog a sturdy platform on which to rest. The straps feel pretty flimsy, and it seems that frequent use would cause them to fray easily. I was very disappointed with this product... and so was my 15 pound shih tzu."
3,Maltipoos,"The small size was too small for my 7 pound maltipoo. Had to return. Also if you are looking for a carrier, on this one, the dog faces outward. Itis not like a kangaroo pouch, which I bought after this and my dog loves. I had no problem with price or quality, it is just a preference issue."
4,Outward Hound Per-a-Roo front pet carrier,"Knowing the color beforehand would have been nice but was not essential. The carrier is liked better by us humans than by our Yorkie, but he likes being on the ground and carrying on rather than being carried. Otherwise, it comes in handy for the few stores that will allow us to bring a dog in with us. It's a good size for our three month old Yorkie, who is all of four pounds at the moment."
4,Will not hold a 20 pound dog,"This is a great bag, and my Chihuahua puppy loves it...however, if you have an animal larger than 7-10 pounds, you would need one size bigger. the compartment size is about the size of a six pack of coke, so bear that in mind. I know for a fact that my 19 pound pug would not fit half of him in there. Otherwise, the bag is great construction, and a cute idea."
1,Pet-A-Roo Pet Carrier,This Pet Carrier will not hold any pet up to 20 lbs as stated in the product description. I have a small puppy that is 5 lbs and it is still too small for her. She barely fits in. I would say it is more for a pet weighing up to 3 lbs and no more then that.
2,Measurements incorrect,"I purchased size Small for my 5.1 lb Chihuahua, after trying to squish her in a couple of times I got out the tape measure.The interior (useable) space in front 8.5"" high, 8"" across and 4"" side width (depth). My Chi is 13"" long, 5"" wide and 7"" high not counting her head and gigantic ears so you see the dilemma.The other issue I found was the way it fits, if you are a large busted person there is no way the strap will cross in the back so its just kind of hooked over the shoulders, not comfortable and won't stay on (especially with weight in it) unless you hold it which defeats the purpose. To sum it up I would say the size small carrier is absolutely perfect for a flat chested person with a guinea pig."
3,not very supportive,"I bought this carrier for my cat. The bottom isn't very supportive at all, and because of this, the sides cave in. My cat seems to like it, but his head gets squished a bit because of the sides caving in. It works much better if I hold the bottom of it, but that defeats the purpose. The dog in the picture shown must be photoshopped into the picture or something, because the bottom is not that flat at all."
2,Runs Small,"Description says that it is for a 10 to 20 lb dog. My 10 lb Chihuahua wouldn't even fit in this. It is also not very deep.Appears to be well-made. So it you have a smaller dog, it may work for you."
4,"Kyjen Outward Hound Front Carrier, Small, Black","Kyjen Outward Hound Front Carrier, Small, Black - 1 it says it fits dogs up to 10 pounds and well my 7pd dog barely fits in it and hes a chihuahua. I returned it because of this and have a medium on the way hoping that will work better . If you have a very small dog maybe a puppy its perfect ."
4,Made my back hurt,"We have a 17 year-old Toy Poodle who is having trouble walking due to her arthritis and still wants to go along with us on walks, so I thought this might be perfect. It is extremely well made and a lovely blue color, but when I put it on and put her in it, even though she only weighs eight pounds, my back was hurting after walking only about 100 yards. I was disappointed and sent it back. Not a design flaw of the carrier, but a design flaw of me!"
2,not for doxies!,"I bought one to try it out on my Dachshunds. They are only 12 pounds and the description says it's for dogs up to 20lbs. My dogs could not comfortably sit in there. It was really awkward holding them on the carrier. Perhaps it's because of their long bodies... Sadly, I had to return it."
1,Uninspired Fluff,Even as a beginner real estate investor I knew that this book was hardly worth reading. It probably took Shemin two weeks to write it and you can read it in an afternoon. Only one or two insights and a lot of real estate common knowlege. It's like Cliff Notes for a REAL investor book. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.
2,Not enough information.,"I've just become interested in real estate investing and this is the third book I've read. It's the first one where the author repeatedly pushes his other products as part of the solution for avoiding the mistakes he identifies. It has been helpful to read the short examples he presents, just to have an awareness of these pitfalls, but he doesn't adequately discuss avoiding the pitfalls. I'm glad I borrowed this book from the library before buying it because it isn't a book I feel is worth owning."
3,ok,not as good as I figured it would be but overall it was informative and I think a lot of people could benefit from it. Well worth the money for most people but not me.
5,Love it,I used the conditioner in the color treatment and my hair never felt softer. I don't use the hair color any more and just wanted the treatment. I understand why someone might be upset at buying it for the price but i would pay anything for it. I love how my hair feels and it is great it is separate from the hair color now since I am no longer coloring my hair.
5,Best hair conditionor on earth!!,"Love, Love, Love this conditionor. I have very fine hair, colored & perm. At first, I thought it would leave my hair flat. Not so, it was light weight, left my hair very manageble & extremely shinny. HOWEVER, I CAN NO LONGER FIND IT IN THE STORES.. AMAZON is the best way to go, keep it coming!"
1,I would NOT purchase this item again!,"I purchased this item because I have used the hair dye that it comes with for years. The product I recieved was NOT the same as what I get in the hair dye kits. This stuff destroyed my hair! I asked for a full refund plus the cost of shipping and got it, that's the only thing on the ""up and up"" about this product. Don't waste your money on this crap, you'd be waaay better off just buying the hair dye kit and using the conditioner in it1"
4,Nice Dress,"This is a nice dress for the cost. The material is very nice. The sizes run a bit larger than what is stated. I had to have mine taken in. The ""thigh length"" comes down to just above my knee and has a 8""+/- side slit."
5,ADICTED TO MUSIC,I RATED THIS CD 5 STARS WITH HONOR. GREAT HARD ROCK CD. THE VOCALIST REMINDS ME KLAUS MEINE FROM SCORPIONS.YOU START LISTENING AND PRESS PLAY AGAIN IMMEDIATELY AS IT ENDS .ALL SONGS ARE KILLERS AND NO FILLERS. ADD THIS GREAT CD TO YOUR COLLECTION AND ENJOY IT LOUD.
5,All of Squeeze's best songs in a great live show!,"Squeeze was one of the best bands of the 1980s. I don't think I played any record as much as my SQUEEZE - SINGLES 45s AND UNDER. This rare video features most of those classic songs in a great concert film. Here is the track list:1. FOOTPRINTS2. PULLING MUSSELS FROM A SHELL3. BLACK COFFEE IN BED4. SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO SHAVE5. IS THAT LOVE6. DR. JAZZ7. UP THE JUNCTION8. SLAUGHTERED, GUTTED AND HEARTBROKEN9. IS IT TOO LATE10. COOL FOR CATS11. TAKE ME I'M YOURS12. IF IT'S LOVE13. HOUR GLASS14. LABELLED WITH LOVE15. ANNIE GET YOUR GUN16. TEMPTED"
3,"Fits, but glass is not as good as OEM","This is a CHEAP replacement glass. I am glad I found this, it saved me a ton over a new mirror assembly from the dealership, but it's not nearly as clear as OEM. It seems distorted. The glass still works regardless and was easy to install, perfectly flush."
1,Movies & TV ???,"As of May 21, 2009, this item is still listed as a DVD under the amazon.com department ""Movies & TV"". THIS IS NOT a DVD MOVIE. This should not be listed under ""Movies"". This should be under books. This is some ""DVD Book"" that you are supposed to read on your computer. Instant return. If I wanted to pay $10 to read the book I would have bought the paperback and saved my eyes in the process."
1,"Be aware of this scam: this DVD is a book, not the movie,","I fell for it, and to make matters even worst, the book is unreadable: book pages scanned for reading on a TV screen? Unfortunately nowhere in the Amazon description nor in the DVD cover package there is a warning or any info explaining that this is actually a book and not the famous movie, so it is very easy to fall for this scam. Frankly, AMAZON should return our money for allowing these thiefs to deceive us, as the DVD is classified under the movies category. I really trusted Amazon when I spent $10 on this DVD.PS: As of early August, AMAZON is no longer selling this DVD-Book, I guess they took notice of the scam."
2,"Not big enough, not enough pockets, not enough PVC lining.",For me the bag isnt large enough to carry a weeks worth of toiletries.I also think that all of the compartments should be PVC lined to prevent leaking into any luggage/bags that you are packing it in.If it were bigger then I'd also suggest having more mesh organizers.The hanging hook has been to small to hang on many of the hooks/dowels/racks I've come across.
2,We'll keep it but don't think it will be capacious enough,"The side compartments are all very narrow, suitable only for things like eyeliner pencils, toothbrush, lipstick and other very narrow items. The main central compartment is quite small, and will not hold something as large as a can of shaving cream. I wish I had ordered something larger."
2,Not for me,"Unfortunately I tossed my other shaver before testing this one out. Now I am bummed. And looking for a new shaver.It doesn't stay hung up on the little peg, just shutting my shower door causes it to fall off (and the razor top to come off). Then to top it off it doesn't shave very well. I think the rubber flexes too much and the blades just don't do the job. It takes me what seems like ages to shave now."
3,ALL,I HAVE DIFFICULTIES ON MY COMPUTERAND CAN NOT LISTEN WITH THE SONY DVD PLAYER DVP-400 DFRANCE REGION 2USA REGION 1
1,Not As Good As Premonition Its a John Fogerty Collectable,"Long journey home Is good, don't know why audio Is not as good as Premonition"" John's second Live Performance In front of a live audience.Have Premonition. There is no comparision to this so called new dvd""Give it a one.Premonition I give it a 10+ Its the true collectable for J-F Fans"""
1,Okay at best,"I've been a fan of John Fogerty since the late 60's when as a 12 year old I used to buy CCR singles at the local record store/appliance center. Having purchased the Long Road Home CD (I'd give it 5 stars), I had high expectations for the DVD. Sorry to say I was greatly disappointed. To not include Proud Mary and Suzy Q are inexcusable omissions. And compared to a number of other concert DVD's I've listened to, the sound quality on Long Road Home came up well short. Unless you are a huge admirer of Fogerty/CCR skip this DVD. Buy the CD instead. You'll enjoy it much more."
1,John Fogerty Premonition VS The long Road Home,I own this dvd compared to John Fogerty's Premonition dvd.I give it a one. Do not believe dvd was made in 2005 or 2006. There is nothing in this dvd to compare to John In his second live appearance in Premonition. The dvd is ok John does not look and sound like he did almost 10 years ago.
5,Just another CCR fan,"I've been a fan of CCR since Tom Fogerty was with the band and that was a LONG time ago. This DVD brought back so many good memories and I enjoy playing this over and over. Plus, much to my surprise, this was also closed-captioned. Being hard-of-hearing, this has helped me so much with the lyrics and I was able to enjoy the concert so much more. So, if you are a CCR fan, get this for your collection. You can't go wrong, believe me."
4,John Fogerty - The Long Road Home in Concert,Another great DVD to own for your video library. A very energetic Fogerty in this DVD. The songs are well done. The video is almost totally focused on Fogerty with little interaction with the other band members. Excellent audio sound.
3,Not the best video but alright,"Ahh... Not the best video as far as camera shots and angles but always a great performance from John. You can feel the energy coming from him. He is really a great performer and gets better with age. The Fogerty style just gets better and more refined. I'd reccomend it in spite of some shortcomings in the production end of the video. A plus is that they put a lot of songs on the disc and this is a great buy , as always from AMAZON. Not a 5 star, but a really great buy and a good attempt from a great musician, John Fogerty."
5,John Fogerty = DVD The Long Road Home,"I saw this concert on cable and went and hunted the DVD down. I was a bit disappointed when the vendor I bought this from, didn't list it as Region 2.""Be sure to check the region?"" (seems there is a Region 1 & 2 version)Being in the US and Region 1 this can present a problem to most peeps!!! I own several standalones. Like Apex and Philips are the two I will mention. Knowing where to look for a hack to make these models 0 region. I got around this problem... Not sure if I'm aloud to post the site. But look for a site under VCDHelp, They have the best up to date on changing most players.I have updated my MP3 player with this concert. Great old rocking Music like Thombstone, Green River, Bayou, Bootleg... and more. If you are a CCR fan Fogerty hasn't lost a step, but the tunes are a bit fast tempo on this DVD.I give it a thumbs up :)"
5,"I LOVED this concert! John Fogerty ""Rocks""!","Spent a great evening watching this DVD concert. All the songs are good ones, no useless filler. He sounds great and just sang one hit after another. You knew the sound or tempo was about to change as he reached for a new guitar or harmonica. The back-up band was really rocking and enhanced the performance. He sang many Creedence songs and did it well. I would highly recommend this DVD. You can't go wrong."
5,Simply Astounding,"A must buy!!! Fogerty and his backing group display an astoundingly high level of positive energy and musicianship. The DVD's sound quality and visuals are excellent (I'm running a high end Denon system thru big Infinity speakers and a 60"" HD screen and the experience is truly remarkable!). If you only have one CCR/Fogerty DVD in your collection, this is the one to have!"
5,"Not bad for a 60 year old man, not bad at all!!!!","A must have for any CC Revival or Fogerty fan. Great sound and an amazing perfomance by the old timer.I hope this review helps; go ahead and buy this DVD, you won't regret it.John, if you ever read this: YOU ARE THE MAN!!! YEAH"
2,Something Smells,"I cannot believe that not one of the reviewers here hasn't noticed the completely obvious vocal overdubs.Now before you shower me with your disapproval of my review,pop in the disc and watch carefully.I question whether any of the vocals are live.I have a couple hundred dvd concerts and I have noticed the odd overdub here and there,but this one takes the cake.If you want definitive Fogerty,buy Premonition(Fogerty even admits to overdubs on that one).It is far superior in every way."
3,"Fogerty's new DVD good...but ""Premonition"" is better","Start this one off with the caveat that I'm a huge Fogerty fan. Also realize that standing alone, this is a very good DVD. Shot at the Wiltern Theater, this is a real good record of Fogerty in concert. A good mix of old and new,(several cuts from his ""Deja Vu..."" release are featured here) John is in good form. Still rockin' hard at 60! He looks young and vigorous and his guitar playing is still sharp. I always felt he was one of the most under-rated lead guitar players of his generation. You'll find plenty of CCR hits here if that's what you're after. The extended jam on ""Keep on Chooglin"""" is worth the price. However, if you can afford only one DVD with your discretionary dollar these days (after you fill up your gas tank!) get ""Premonition"" from 1998. The bonus there is the sound quality and video are better having been shot on a studio soundstage. Also there's Kenny Aronoff on drums, which really makes the show."
5,Oldie but goodies,"It is easy to see that John Fogerty still loves what he does. This 2005 concert starts off strong and never lets up. He plays all his golden hits and makes us remember those good Credence Clearwater rockers. His voice and charisma have not wavered. Thanks, John."
3,When Women Had Tails,"Looks dated now, but did remind me of the drivein movies and the 70s. Might be worth 8 or 10 dollars but no more."
3,Yuck Yuck,"The title of this movie is perhaps the best indication of its content.The jacket claims adult only, warns of nudity, sexual content & hype's Senta Berger's role. This may all have been true if filmed in the 50's but it was not true when this was made. It's really for a virgin sexually (giggle,giggle).This is a spoof with medium level humor through out. You will also spend most of your time watching male cavemen with very little female anything. The sexual content is merely pantomimed in the broadest manner.If you want a comedy with slapstick action this is it. Nudity is limited to an occasional breast & not Senta Berger's either. She does wear a great cave woman outfit. It gets 3 Amazon stars for absurd stupidity, which I enjoy somewhat."
4,Works great. Doesn't weigh down fine hair.,"The only complaint I have about the Hemp conditioner is the smell. It does not have the same citrus smell as the shampoo. The performance of the product: does not weigh hair down, does combat fly-aways, does combat static, does moisturize even in mid-winter."
5,All-Delicious,"An amazing book everything is superb about it, from the fantastic illustrations to the mouth-watering recipes! Everything about this book makes me smile even the vegetables; all the recipes work and are all-delicious. This book appeals to both adults and children, it makes everybody in the family happy and fun.It is a great book.Peter"
5,loved this book,"This is a great book to learn how to make something completely different: an adult version of shaved ice. I loved that it included easy instructions and had savory & sweet versions. Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for something different to serve, especially for the holidays when all the foods are incredibly heavy. A cranberry granita would be refreshing and memorable! And would have a definite wow factor, too."
3,"Nice book, pretty pictures","This book is 120 pages, but has only 55 recipes in it. A nice little book, artfully designed, with attractive pictures. The granita ingredients lists are complete, as are the instructions. The freezing method is also well explained. It seems to be aimed at the beginner, so a few definitions would have helped. I'm a novice at this (& perhaps a stupid one), but I didn't know what ""zest"" meant. I gathered that it had something to do with peeling the rind off fruits, so I used a potato peeler. As you cooks out there will guess, this produced less than magnificent results. I then consulted with an ""expert"" (my wife) who told me what it meant & went out & bought me a ""zester,"" which is a necessary piece of equipment for making fruit granitas. Don't try it without one! On p. 11 of the book, the author lists the implements needed & states that ""no special equipment is needed,"" but she neglects to mention a zester in this section."
2,Where is the Horror?,"Good horror stories keep you on the edge of your seat, this barely kept me awake."
4,Very useful dictionary,Much better than vine dictionary and compare to Mounce's expository dictionary.Using Strong number it is to get the meaning behind word immeadiately
5,Awesome!!,"I ordered the sterling silver Loving Family charm necklace for my sister. Quality, product, price, customer service, return & re-order process. Everything was amazing. I have recommended Relios to a friend that fell in love with my purchase, and now hers is on the way. I am going to order the Loving Family charm for myself."
2,Not nearly what I remember,Not nearly as I remember but then the years tend to do that to you. Purchasing and watching some of the newer DVD's has been a lot more enjoyable.
3,"Good, not great",A little long and somewhat repetitive but OK. I would get a smaller version that would be easier to read next time. I gave this out to management employees and they have all gotten about half way through it.
5,So valuable!!!,More helpful than I ever imagined. I bought the Kindle Edition and have bound as well. It revealed to me things I was and was not doing that was subtracting from the teams function
2,Motivational,"It is not easy to see the entire picture when you are alone. With this book, Dr. John Maxwell makes the picture boarder.With his help and by applying the suggestions,I was able to experience and see the significance of teamworking unfolding.This is a book worth reading."
2,Basic Knowledge,"If you have read John's 21 Irrefutable Laws of a Leader, there is absoloutely no need to pick up this book. It is very fundamental stuff that correlates with the before mentioned book."
4,"Good mix of factoids, inspiration and leadership pointers","Building on the successful formula of his earlier work, author John C. Maxwell (The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership) has delineated 17 ""laws"" for managers who want to develop successful teams. That number may be arbitrary, but Maxwell successfully uses his laws as a springboard to weave together inspiring tales from Navy Seals, mountain climbers, Colin Powell, George Washington, Jimmy Carter, major league coaches and others into punchy chapters that any aspiring leader can use. This book provides the right mix of factoids, inspiration and leadership pointers to make it a bestseller. Even better, coaches and leaders who use these tips should be able to build better teams. We recommend this book to coaches, mentors and team leaders."
2,"The ""laws"" are indisputable for a reason","From the favorable reviews, I assumed that this would be an informative book. However, this is not the case. I learned very little in the course of reading the book, and here is why:The laws are obvious. Anyone who has ever been part of a team and given even a little thought as to what elements make a team function well will be unsurprised by the list. The reason that the author says the laws are ""indisuptable,"" is that the laws are so obvious that anyone can see that they seem to generally hold.Don't waste your time with this book. Instead, check out ""First, Break all the Rules,"" which is an innovative work that addresses management issues (including teamwork)."
4,Leadership and Teamwork,"needed this book for my Masters class, only had to review one chapter, easy read, only buy if you need to."
1,Not Real Impressed,The book was a waste of a good [money]. It relied to heavily on cut and paste stories from the headlines and from history. It lacked heart.
1,Not reliable,"This unit has not consistently registered wind speed or rainfall and sometimes does not register at all. The unit pictured shows a weather vane for wind direction, but unit received did not come with this feature and is not shown in the picture on the box."
3,A let down after Volume 1.,"I enjoyed the first in this series but found this second book disappointing. The graphic style sagged with too much Manga cuteness and less dynamic, novel creativity for the eye. The plot was also less than compelling. However I still plan to keep reading the series."
4,Childhood and Beyond,"This second volume of ""Buddha"" is much more centered on Siddhartha (the Buddha). We explore his childhood and early years as prince. Being an often restless, disobedient, child Siddhartha leaves the castle. Along with Tatta, who we met in the last book, Siddhartha learns of the suffering, disease, and death of the outside world, that he has been guarded against.Faced with a fear of death, Siddhartha must choose between his duties as future king, or to follow a path to enlightenment. Even as he debates with himself, he adds the burden of a wife. Who must also be left behind if he wishes to leave to find enlightenment and the meaning of life.Tezuka adds to what he had started in the first volume, and begins new stories to be carried forward."
5,It hit the mark.,"The indie film rides high. They hit the mark with this one; funny, well-written, good acting. The guy on the cruiser is my favorite, but all the characters are gems."
3,"Mediocre movie, Outstanding Soundtrack","Like being on a flight to a wonderful destination, full of anticipation, but your plane never gets off the ground. I spent the entire movie waiting for something that would grab hold but it just left me wanting more...a lot more. I did love, love, love the soundtrack...."
1,Stinks like ****,"This is the only review I've ever done. I felt compelled when this came ""recommended"" in my inbox. Umm. NO! I've seen this movie. Sometimes movies made by commercial /music video directors work (Sexy Beast, Control, even Belly and Hard Candy) sometimes they are shiny, hollow vessels of nothingness save for perhaps visual histamines. This was easily the worst movie I've seen this year, and I saw Sorority House."
3,Interesting but ultimately confused,"This ambitious book attempts to model belief dynamics. It is largely formal in character and includes sections devoted to applying the modeling to specific kinds of beliefs and is thus quite complete in that sense. However, the modelling is at best a (to speak metaphorically) a 'zero-order' approximation. In particular, the notions of minimality discussed seem to suffer from vagueness."
1,Cannot believe such books sell!,"I listen to a wide selection of audio books and I still cannot believe that I actually listened to 8 out of the 12 CDs of this publication. While listening to this, I was really wondering if there are adults who truthfully enjoy such stories. Witches, dolphins, Interpol, Russian mafia, lots of sex and nothing to the storyline. What a waste of my time!"
2,Beware story line,"This is my least favorite story line of any in the romance genre. ""Years ago lovers split apart and now one or both won't forgive"". I always find that tedious, and this book is no different. If you happen to like the hurting lovers thing, fine, but otherwise this book is only worth reading if you intend to continue with the Drake sisters. The other 2 stories before this one were great. It's hard to keep turning pages when they are all full of ""I can't forgive myself or him"". blah blah blah over and over."
3,Unimaginative and predictable,"Oceans of Fire is the third installment of the Drake Sisters series. I agree with other reviewers that the plot was a bit typical and very similar to the first two books...basically been there, read that. The story is also infused with hot and heavy sex scenes as if it's a poor attempt to prop up an already mundane and predictable plot. Abigail is one of my favorite Drake sisters and I wish Ms. Feehan had come up with a better story for her."
2,"Just ""Meh""","This is an Ok book. The characters were tended to be rather ""twee."" The story between the two main characters was clever, however, there didn't seem to be any emotion between the two."
2,Slow...dull...disappointing,"I have to agree with those here who found this book slow and boring. I generally like Feehan's work, but this one was a chore to try and read. I felt no sexual tension between Abby and Aleksandr...actually, I felt nothing for this couple. I'd read half the book and couldn't have cared less whether they got together or not. Abby was whiny and irritating, Aleksandr was cold and emotionless. I've read other stories in this series and liked them, so, I really wanted to like this one too, but I had to give up before I was finished with it. When I put down a book and don't particularly care to pick it up again, that's when I know it's just not working for me."
3,LOVE Christine... BUT....,"Just couldn't get into this series. I hear lots of ppl like it, but it just didn't do anything for me."
1,The Magic isn't in this Wind,"Let me begin by stating that I have not read any of her other series. I read the short story ""Magic in the Wind"" in a collection loaned to me by a friend; I enjoyed it very much. The idea of *seven witchy sisters* thrilled me(yes, I'm a ""Charmed"" fan). I enjoyed ""The Twilight Before Christmas"" when it came out as well. I really felt that I was getting to know the sisters as people. They each had a personality and voice.I was very eager to read ""Oceans of Fire"" when I found it in the bookstore.Strange as it may sound, I felt as if someone else had written this book. It felt off-kilter, almost as if the characters were caricatures of themselves. Something was missing...I don't know how to define it.Honestly, I wouldn't recommend it. The plot itself was not intriguing, and hello, it's a romance novel--we know the end result from page one.I'm just hoping that Ms. Feehan can recapture the dynamics for the next installment. Only time will tell..."
2,"Please don't tell me there are 4 more ""drake"" stories....","Utterly boring. I borrowed this book rather than pay money for it; and I was right. I like Ms. Feehan's ""Dark Series"", but so far all of the ""Drake"" books seem too forced and unbelievable. If you want a good romantic ""witch"" type story, read The Three Sisters tilology by Nora Roberts, and leave the drakes on the shelf."
3,Great series,MS Feehan gets it done right. The story flows and the other stuff is just the right touch.
3,A little hard to swallow,"I loved the Russian hero, and the Russian backstory wasn't bad. The aunt and the rest of the characters in the book were interesting. I just really disliked Abby. Why did he want her, she was an annoying whiner who seemed overly concerned with herself. I couldn't understand why the Russian didn't dump her and choose a more interesting sister. Also, the mystery (plot?) wrapped itself up most unconvincingly. Don't buy it at full price, borrow it if you can."
3,"Beginning and ending great, middle boring","This book started off with a bang and dolphin lover that I am, I couldn't put it down. The middle of the book, however, lost me. I found myself skimming and not really enjoying the back and forth of the characters. The addition of the Russian who can do magic was inspired but I found that one of the weak points was that this was not brought it a conclusion.I loved the last third of the book. The blend of action and romance and the resiolution were great. I just wish that I had enjoyed the middle more."
3,Oceans of Fire,"After years of wandering, Abby Drake has found her way home. Like her sisters, she is gifted with powers that can be both a torment and a blessing; hers give her a special relationship with all things of the sea, especially dolphins. Yet, her angst over her powers is at least one of the things that kept her from finding her true love with Sasha, the dangerous Russian agent she loved and lost four years ago. Now, Sasha has come back into her life and he needs help that only her powers can provide. Is this a second chance for them or will his mission take a deadly turn that ends all their hopes?*** Though not as strong a series as the early Dark books, it's hard not to like a book with dolphins in it. Abby's emotional turmoil is very understandable, seeing how her gifts have set her apart from the majority of the world. Supporting characters provide comic relief and quirks that lighten the seriousness of the overall plot. ***"
5,What a Great Book!,"This book has everything I love in a romance. Hot sex,a great plot and intresting characters like Hannah and Jonas I cannot wait for there book! A great believable romance."
1,Wake me when its over,"I have tried three times to read this book and am bored to sleep each time. I have read every book that Christine Feehan has ever written and gotten several of my friends hooked on her ""Dark"" series. Why does Abigail have to be so stupid and helpless? I have to agree with Josh Whedon, there are too many female lead characters in fiction and movies who ""run into the dark alley where the bad guys are."" He created Buffy the Vampire slayer. Christine keeps creating the same helpless, confused female lead that I just can't feel anything but frustration for. This is probably my last Christine Feehan book.I would summarize the plot, but there just isn't much of one really. Girl gets hurt by guy. Girl leaves. Girl meets guy again. Girl is still hurt but loves guy. Bad guys chase girl and her guy. Good guys win after much intrigue. Guy gets girl. The end."
5,Drake Sisters,"3rd in the Drake Sisters Series by Feehan, this story features Abigail Drake, who is home visiting her sisters, and swimming/communing with the dolphins when she witnesses a murder. Abby becomes a target of the killers while she and the dolphins are saving the life of a local man who'd been shot, as well. When her mysterious Russian lover from her past appears and protects her, they work together using the paranormal capabilities of the sisters to find who tried to kill Abby's friend and who did kill Aleksandr's partner. This one got me hooked on the series, and I am now impatient for the rest of the books to come out!"
2,annoying,i thought this was an okay book to begin with but then you add in the fact that it repeats itself half a dozen times it gets downright annoying. the two main characters have the same conversation like 20 times but they never come to a solution or really even fully discuss it they just kind of skim over general topic.
5,Love the sisters,"Love knowing that although they are powerful, they are just like us with their feelings. Can't wait to see who falls in love next."
4,must read,"Oceans of fire is the third book in the The Drake Sisters Series. I enjoyed this book as much as l have the first two in the series and look forward to reading book 4. It is full of excitement, plus a good romance to make it a must read. I feel as if l know the sisters and would love to be part of their family."
5,Nice a little more info would be great,"So got this gate because it was similar to the one we previously had! The item arrived with very little instructions! It was mostly pictures, come on now; I know this is not hard to assemble but, it would of been nice if it would of told me where to mount screw, it did not show it anywhere on the instruction where you need to locate them, and there is like four places they could go! Also the instructions fail to mention, that you can move the lock if you need to have the gate swing a different direction, I figured this out by looking at it; but again-- would of been nice instead of standing there scratching my head for a few minuted! They do include the measurement placement of the hardware which makes it nice so you are not trying to hold the gate up and try to mark everything! The gate is nice, the price is great-- instructions suck!"
2,Not the best vhdl synthesis book,"I found this book to be written in a confusing manner, and full of mistakes. For example, on page 51, the author says that hexadecimal E equals decimal 15. Apparently this is not a typo, because it is repeated on page 52, along with the statement that hexadecimal F equals decimal 16. For the beginner, I recommend Bhasker's vhdl primers. Ashenden's Designer's Guide to VHDL is the gold standard for a comprehensive text on the language itself, although it is skimpy on synthesis."
4,Tiny but Useful,"I purchased this little guy to go in a powder room where I have a pedestal sink and therefore no storage. The price is right since it is so low but this cabinet is also low (check those dimensions), it doesn't even come up to my knee. It comes in one piece already assembled so you just pop it into a corner. There is one shelf and you can easily put two rolls of toilet paper in there and some more small trinkets. I can't tell if it's weird to put it on the floor by itself since it is so tiny or if it would make more sense to put it on top of something more substantial for hidden storage. The doors have a magnetic connection or something so it shuts securely. There is a weird design on it and some ""shabby"" intentional black marks to make it more ""chic"" but it's a good little purchase for the money, I would recommend it."
3,"Cabinet is not that well made, but it was relatively cheap","The cabinet I recieved seems to have a paper mache overlay, which was peeling on two corners. Also, the white paint (which remindes me of Kilzs for prepainting) used comes off on your hands. However,it was fairly inexpensive and, if you glue it back down, it is fairly sturdy. Also, as I was planning to use it to store my paints, it was the right size. I gave this a three becuase the quality was not as good as other items I'd bought from this seller. My biggest issue is that the seller has emailed me about once a month since I bought this imploring me rather dramatically me to revise my review and explaining that she has two kids to feed and that my neutral review has ruined her business. It is a bit annoying, so I do not think I will use the seller again."
4,Cute for bathroom,I bought this for my half bath. It's cute and tiny. I put my lotions inside as well as a toilet paper roll. I will say for the price it's a good purchase. The only thing I'd say negatively is it needs repainting (mine had black marks on it which is no biggy if you have the time to repaint). Also the one door looks fragile if mishandled or too rough with it. If you're looking for a decorative piece for a bathroom or maybe corner counter space it does the job. You do get what you pay for and for this price it's decent.
1,rip off,"It's not an exaggeration: this book is even mini for an infant, on whose hands it equals in size. The quotations were poorly picked, and its only abuses and affronts are on its buyer."
1,A terrible umbrella,"I bought this umbrella here on Amazon a month or so ago. I was excited because I thought, 'hey, Samsonite is a good brand'. Well, It broke down after about a month. One of the metal prongs came loose and is now a hassel to close and open. This umbrella is not even automatic like my previous one from Fred Meyer. That one lasted much longer, too. I wasn't even in the wind and this umbrella broke. Terrible"
3,Great umbrella but too small,"It is a great umbrella, although it is a little small. It has gone inside out twice, but it still works after that."
1,Terrible writing and directing,"Two items were obvious in this not so funny movie: 1) the writing/screenplay leaves much to be desired, I agree with the previous comment about Tomlin, why was her charcter even in the movie? 2) Zwart's directing clearly shows all he wanted to do was finish this terribly written movie without any retakes. Maybe he should try directing a 3 Stooges remake. Then again, why ruin their slap-stick humor.Steve Martin is a talented and funny actor, but this movie was way beneath his talents."
2,good cast stuck in mediocre material,"""Pink Panther 2"" offers a second helping - as if one were needed or wanted - of Steve Martin impersonating Peter Sellars impersonating a Frenchman. In this sequel to the 2006 original (if a movie based on a 35-year-old franchise can be called original), the inept, bumbling, pratfall-prone Inspector Clouseau has signed on as part of a ""Dream Team"" of international detectives who are hot on the trail of The Tornado, a shadowy crime figure who's been stealing some of the world's most priceless - and heavily guarded - treasures, including the famed Pink Panther diamond.Obviously an acquired taste, ""PP2"" consists almost entirely of Martin mugging for the camera, while everyone else stands around smirking and rolling their eyes in corny reaction shots. It's a witless affair, overall, but at least we get to toodle around Paris and Rome some and enjoy the work of Jean Reno, Andy Garcia, Lily Tomlin, Jeremy Irons and John Cleese into the bargain."
2,A Stupid kind of Silly,"This movie consisted of nothing more than a series of disconnected sequences of Steve Martin's slap stick humor, wrapped in a poorly conceived mystery, which ends in an all to predictable fashion. And oh by the way, Lilly Tomlin is thrown in to add something to the movie (still haven't figured out what it is). This movie is silly, and in a stupid way, don't buy it or watch it, save yourself both the time and money."
4,above average,"not as good as the first but still worth the time. had it's funny moments, it could of been better than the first if kevin kline came back."
4,Funny,"I don't think I've ever watched a film that was so bad during which I laughed so much. I am not fan of Steve Martin in general, and his accent here was particularly poor. There is too much slapstick, much of which isn't integrated into the film. The Lily Tomlin character serves no real purpose. The plot meanders. Yet, in spite of all its flaws, Pink Panther 2 is one funny film."
1,"Product quality good, just a bad movie.","My kids and I enjoyed the first Steve Martin Pink Panther movie, but this one was just bad. Thankfully the price was cheaper than a rental."
4,Great family movie,"This is a great family movie, some simple action, good comedy, Steve Martin is always a fun time and my kids just love it."
2,Punk'd panther,"Despite some startling star power, including John Cleese, Lily Tomlin, and Jeremy Irons, this rarely rises above silly accents and slapstick. Your eleven year old will find it enjoyably unsophisticated, but fans of the Peter Sellers classics should seek entertainment elsewhere.-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters"
4,Panther scores again,"Steve Martin hs come up with another hit. I never thought that any one could match Sellers, but he comes awfully close. However in thethe first one that ""hamburger"" skit was the most boring and annoying thing that I have ever seen in a movie. I hope that there is a third one. 4 stars. bernardo"
4,pink panther,this isnt as good as the originals nobody can do the original guy so you might not like it as much butt if its first time seeing pink panther you might laugh your head off.
1,Someone please save this film from itself!!!!!,"I am not sure where to start complaining about this film. Not only is it NOT funny, but Steve Martin should stick to playing characters closer to who he is and his nature because he seriously cannot keep an accent going, especially the French accent. The acting talents of Andy Garcia, Alfred Molina, Jean Reno, Jeremy Irons and John Cleese are wasted in every way, shape, form and direction. I am not sure what Lily Tomlin was doing in this film. It brings tears to my eyes to know these brilliant actors consented to star in this crap of a film! Someone please advise Aishwarya Rai Bachachan that she CANNOT act and is in dire need of acting lessons. She is a mediocre actress and even the word mediocre is too complimentary. Sorry to sound so negative, but I find being honest refreshing. Don't waste your time."
2,An Ok $1 Rental.,"A good cast could not makeup for a bad storyline and uneven flow. It looks like silly jokes were edited together to form scenes, and in term they made a storyline. Not nearly as good as the first one, where the jokes were a well integrated part of the storyline."
1,"Good Lord, Is This Bad!","The cast: Jeremy Irons, Alfred Molina, Jean Reno, John Cleese, Steve Martin. ALL GOOD ACTORS. Steve Martin is a brilliant guy. The Jerk was/is a hilarious film. Roxanne is a smart/funny movie.So WHY is this piece of cinema torture so bad? It looks like everybody was getting paid, but no one cared about the work. Its not funny, none of it. One stupid pratfall after another followed by some lame jokes, ugh...Do yourself a favor, skip this cinematic water-boarding."
1,Low IQ entertainment,Steve Martin is not a comedian. He is a buffoon. The film is chock full with his buffoonery; only a few people laughed in the theater I was in when it came out and the film lost money; the film was mostly irritating. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie.
2,Pink Panther 2,"Although, nothing compares to the Peter Sellers version, I expected more from Steve Martin given that I always enjoy his movies. The revised Pink Panther 1 with Steve Martin may be significantly better but version 2, failed completely in my humble opinion."
2,I was a little disappointed,"i read every single one of these book series except for the last one. i think this book was the worst. the first 2 books were fabulous because it was so exciting and interesting. this book was just a plain dud. what's the story line? and it was way too freaky and confusing about all this stuff with Malcolm, John, and the mother. Hello!! Malcolm is dead and over with! and this whole insanity thing with poor Bart was a little out of hand and sick. i expected better from V C Andrews. but i have to give her credit-her other books were terrific. here's some advice: if you're planning to read the whole book series, you might as well skip this one. you're wasting your time and money. nothing changes in the story anyway. ok well, Cathy has 2 sons, the youngest goes crazy thanks to her mom who's her neighbor. also, get this, Cathy's THIRD husband is....CHRIS! how SICK can you get? i'm disgusted."
2,harder used than led to believe,"this book was badly used, which was alot worse than i was led to believe. while all the pages were intact, they were badly misused. maybe i felt like this because i have used books that still look new. if i was to buy another book from this company, i would spend the extra and get it new."
3,"Took a while to arrive, very tattered","The book was pretty beat up and although it arrived with in the time frame it was supposed to, I have never waited that long for something I have purchased off of Amazon."
5,Book review,My grandaughter thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was in great shape and the shipping was quicker than expected.
3,Ehh,Confusing so far. Defiantly not as good as the first book or the second. She should have just stopped after the second
2,Vengeance from the grave,"""Flowers in the Attic"" was an exercise in stagnation, as far as plot and characters, but ""Petals on the Wind"" showcased Andrews' talent for combining the surreal Gothic world of the Dollangangers with lots of soap opera. ""If There Be Thorns"" is a disappointing 2 steps backward. There is nothing really new in this story, it's simply a rehashing of the Evil Malcolm Foxworth and his Diabolical Deeds. Once again, the incest theme prevails, for no apparent reason except that there'd be no plot without it. Cathy and Chris are now pretending to be a ""married couple"" and ""living in sin"". Golly-lolly! ...again, there are very few surprises in the story. No moments of anticipation, or guessing what will happen next. Overall, a very tedious read."
3,Not a great read,"I found the story line ridiculous, but the bigger problem was the way it was written. They use Cathy's sons Jory and Bart to tell the story. Jory is boring at it and Bart doesn't use full sentences so it's so hard to follow what he is saying. I found myself skimming so I could still get the idea of the story but I didn't have to deal with how Bart ""talked"".I wouldn't skip the book because it really helps to explain some of the things in the next book, but don't expect it to live up to the first one."
2,Slightly Disappointing...,"After reading ""Petals..."" I felt it was nessecary to finish the series, eager to know where Chris and Cathy end up. I must say as a character Bart is rather disturbing and the plot seems to drag on and on and on and on(you get the idea) BUT there are some key scenes that one must read to fully understand the 4th book. I would say buy it used OR read it for free in a bookstore."
3,not as good as the others in the series,"I didn't think this book was as good as the others in the series, but it includes a lot of information about Jory and Bart in it that you probably want to know if you plan on reading the fourth book. Jory and Bart alternate telling the story, so it wasn't narrated by Cathy, but if she were to tell it, half of the information just wouldn't be there."
5,The wicked mother returns!And this series just keep getting better.,"Cathy has two kids,Jory and Bart.Cathy and chris both take care of her kids.Chris,though not the father,takes full responsibility as the father,playing the fatherly roll.But anyway after Chris and Cathy's mother moves in next door with her butler,John Amos,Things start to go bad.For one thing,she tries to get Bart on her side.And the great thing about this story is that it is written from the point of view of both Bart and Jory...The grandmother's main purpose is not just to make her grandkids like her,but to win the hearts of the children,Chris and cathy,once more...Boy,does she try hard,but does she succeed?She wants to beg forgiveness and with the hatred Cathy has for her,Things are definitely not going in her favour...enjoy...Nigel."
3,The Dollanganger story continues...,"I would have given this book 5 stars if it wasn't for the animal cruelty. Being an animal activist, I will not tolerate any kind of animal abuse whether it be fiction or real. Also, it was obvious from the beginning, who the stranger next door was. This book was predictable the whole way through. Chris seemed whiny and Cathy was not the same. This book was either written by a ghostwriter or VC Andrews had a headache the day it was written. If you want to continue reading about this saga though, I'd recommend you read it."
2,Too Disturbing For Me,"I liked the first book in this series, and the second one was okay. This book, however, was too disturbing for me. I decided to give up the series after being left with an unsettled feeling after reading this book. Bart, age nine, was so disturbed, it was difficult for me to read his morbid and twisted thoughts. Definitely need something a lot lighter to read after this book. I can only guess at how the others will unwind, and at this point, I just don't want to know."
4,Not the best in the series,"I LOVE the Flowers in the Attic series, but this one was not one of my favorites. Cathy is portrayed as a dumb blonde who shows favoritism only to Jory and Cindy. Chris seems melodramatic, but then again, he always was. From the very beginning you know who the stranger is moving in next door. Bart's transformation is mesmerizing and sometimes creepy. It's a quick read though. Just don't let the switch in narrarators throw you off."
4,a sort of disappointment for me,"I really was hoping that Cathy and Chris never ended up together but well that's the way it is written. I particularly liked this book because it was written from Bart and Jory's point of views. I don't think that this book was really as good as the first two, but it's worth reading"
3,Not as good as the rest,"I was very dissapointed in If There Be Thorns, It is told from the point of veiw of her two sons Bart and Jory. The book is very dry and kinda dull, the only real interesting parts ar the ones told from Bart's point of view. But all in all this book justs plods along to a dull and uninspiring ending."
3,Not very intresting,"Although it is narrated by Bart and Jory,I didn't find it very intresting.Corrine deserves more suffer.Bart's attitude is to hostile.And I believe its more of the same thing.I did believe that Cathy's hate was going to make her become more of Corrine.She really did forget to fast.It's not a bad lecture but I expected more."
5,"""The Bad Son Versus the Obedient Son""","Chris and Cathy made a loving home for their sons, Jory,and Bart.Then the lights came on next door. Soon the Old Lady in Black was there, watching them, guarded by her strange old butler. Soon she had Bart over for treats and asked him to call her ""Grandmother.""And soon Bart's transformation began from this point on in the story. Fed by the hint of terrible things about his mother and father, this leads him into shocking acts of violence.Now when this little boy trembles on the edge of madness, his anguished parents await the climax to a horror that flowered in an attic long ago, a horror whose thorns are still wet with blood, still tipped with fire.As I read, I always wondered what Bart would do next.A good read."
3,Confusing when switching points of view,This story like MY SWEET AUDRINA confused me. It started with Cathy's point of view. Then it turned to the view point of her sons. It was terrifying to the whole family when Bart turned mean. Jory was upset when his dog Clover was killed. Cindy was scared to death of Bart when he threatened her. Cindy needed to be reminded that she could trust Chris and Cathy and Jory. John Amos had no business using Bart to get to Chris and Cathy.
2,BIG DISAPOINTMENT!,"After reading ""Flowers.."" and ""Petals.."", I thought that this one would be just as good, or even better, but I was disapointed at the plot and the story line. It mostly surrounds Cathy's young son Bart, who narrates it and does awful things to hurt his family, just because some old man tells him to. I didn't understand that whole issue. Another thing is, is that it surrounds this one summer of his life, where usually this series spands over many years in the course of the character's lives. Cathy and Chris' ""marriage"" was gross and unrealistic. Jory and Cindy's characters should have been developed more. The ending is the only part I felt that should have been read."
3,A FILLER!~,"well- i LOVE sequels but this was just a bunch of soap opera gibberish- i mean poor little Bart is out of control and how do you say john amos' name -is it john Amoss, or john Amo or john amose this book is just a bunch of laddydah that should be kicked out- and I dont know about you but this was way to out of hand with all that religous gods revenge- but as an andrews reader it wasn't horrible."
4,"Brilliant, V.C. does it again!!!","I've read all of V.C. Andrews' books. This has to be one of the best(aside from Melody which was the first I read and so captivated me more)books ever written. The beginning grabs you and stuns you and readers young, old and just plain experienced readers agree V.C. is one of the greatest. V.C. has hooked me!!!!(note)I never give a book more than four stars."
2,cruelty goes too far,"I love the Dollanganger series as much as anyone, but this book bothered me. I love animals and what Bart did to his dog, Apple just made me furious. He ties the dog up, puts his food just out of reach and leaves him in a swelteringly hot barn. That scene made me cry nad cry. Someone finlly discovers him, and when Bart sees that Apple is running around the barn chasing a ball, healthy and frisky again, he abuses him, kicks him and such. That scene was the most awful thing I had ever read. With all of VC Andrews wonderful writings, why did she include this?"
3,It's not as good as the first two,"It's the pretty good story of Cathy's two sons' encounter with her mother Corrine. After years in a mental institution Corrine comes back to live in the house next door. While she's there she's secretly having her younger grandson Bart over to play. As he slowly changes he begins to hate all women, especially his mother, the bad things start to happen, and Cathy and Chris' dear secret starts to unravel. V.C. uses an enteresting style of writing in this book. In each chapter either Jory or Bart is in the narritive position as they tell the story from their point of view. It definately wasn't as good as the first two books because it is a little slow. But go ahead and read it if you'd like to know what happens to them, or if you're the type who likes to finish the series. It is very interesting."
3,Creepy tale tries to recapture spell of 'Flowers'.,"After the disappointing Petals on the Wind I wondered just what story was left to tell about Cathy and Chris and their troubled family. Not much it seems.This tale revolves around Cathy writing the book that would become 'Flowers in the Attic' while an elderly lady and her sour and sinister butler try to connect with her children, Bart and Jory. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out just who the old lady is.The two children (one well adjusted, the other suffering mentally) take turns telling the bitter tale. While that makes for an uneven narrative it does get the novel closer to the gothic tone of the fractured fairy tale mixed with taboo shattering family secrets in Flowers than the meandering, heavy on the soap suds Petals did. Close but no cigar."
1,Hit-a-way tennis,"We bought the hit-a-way pole & tennis ball attachment for tennis practice after watching the video of Andy Rodick & other pro player hitting with it. It did not work for us. It was not possible to keep the ball going around the pole. We have played national level tennis & above & we could not get it to work, nor could our intermediate level players or beginers use it. The tennis ball attachment would get entangled in the pole after one or two hits.Maybe it would work for kids baseball because that is just one hit."
2,Overwrought and overrated,"A columnist in Vienna gets pulled into a possibly murder by the pregnant wife of a man he only met once. Genetic mystery set in the future, full of intrigue and politics.I found the language irritatingly florid-- Mathews seemed to be writing from some obscure rule that required using the most obscure word possible for any given possibility. And I can't imagine that I was the only person who found the ending quite distasteful-- what exactly was he trying to say?Some nice Vienna atmosphere, but unless you're really bored, I'd skip this one."
2,Couldn't get into it,"The characters and plot didn't compel me to get more than 1/4 of the way into the book. While the tone of the novel is cyber-punkish or noir-ish, that alone wasn't enough to keep me going."
3,Not his first book....,"I've yet to read this book, but why does everyone think this is his first novel? His first novel was The Hat of Victor Noir, which is very good."
3,Safety Issue,"this is a great product until you get hurt! when i was using it, i worn surgical gloves, so when i was retracting it, the end of the rod sliced my hand and i ended up going to the emergency room to get some stitches! when i went back home, i checked to see what could have sliced my hand, and it turns out it is the end of the rod that was razor sharp. The manufacture did put a plastic cover over it, but the cover was so loose that it slided down, exposing the sharp end. Be extremely careful with this product before use, or just use a filer to file the sharp edges."
5,Cobra 3/4 inch 100 foot flat sewer rod,I bought a 25 foot Cobra 3/4 inch snake earlier that work well for inside the house but it did reach the clog we had in an outside drain which had become frozen this past winter. We have a drainage system under our house and it drains about 150 feet away from the house down a hill The drain is not buried that deep and backed up into the basement. This snake reached the problem area and was very useful to stop the flooding we were experiencing in the basement. The price for both these items was very reasonable and they did not have a delivery charge. I would recommend these products to anyone. They work well for me.
5,This product is just what I needed!,"I've been having recurring problems with my main line, borrowing a snake every month or so to clean it out. The day the Cobra came, the line was backed up again, so I immediately put it to work. First off, it is faster and easier to use than any motor driven snake and besides that, it worked great! The line was cleared and has remained that way for close to two months now. Quick, easy, efficient, and VERY affordable (especially compared to all the other options out there)."
5,"If you own a home, you need one of these",I bought this because I kept having trouble with my toilet. I had already purchased a 25 foot one from the local supply store but it wasn't half as great as this. This saves you so much money and you can do what needs to be done at home instead of having to call a plumber. This pays for itself in one use because to call a plumber out would be at least $90 where I live. So if you own a home you need to invest in one of these you can't beat the price nor the piece of mind if your little one drops his spiderman down the toilet.
2,Cheap,Light Duty Snake. Not any good for my needs. You get just what you pay for.Would not recomend this product.
2,Packaging very bad,"This item is missing the spear head point that is supposed to be attached to it, I checked the box it was shipped in three times to make sure I did not miss it. The box is maybe 5 times the size of the item sent to me, inside just one piece of crumpled up paper, I guess to show an attempt at protecting the contents. The box came in pretty torn, even the U.P.S driver commented on the fact that the box was bad. How can it not be, this heavy piece of rolled up metal moving all over the place in this big box. Well, I am not sure how this item is going to work, and its effectiveness since I am missing a piece of it. I will not return since I needed to open up my drain, hopefully it will work without the missing piece. I should return it and just have them send a new one, hopefully they will make this right and send me the piece missing. I will update the review if they do."
5,Cobra Sewer Rod,"The Cobra sewer rod, for the sewer was a good buy. It's built of sturdy steel an designed well. It's easy to use. An it got the job done."
1,"Tape/blade design Engineered wrong, returned","I don't know how others got it work, but it did not work for me, and with reason. The tape/blade design meant to only bend in a plane/2-dimensional way, not in the third dimension. If you are sure your drainage pipe only has turns in a plane/surface, then fine. If not sure, don't buy it.My kitchen drainage has a outside openning/access. One foot into the drainage from outside, it has a turn to the left. Here is the problem: it can't turn in the wide direction of the blade! No matter how hard I tried, it cut off lots of PVC pipe debris and still could not turn, because a blade/tape can't turn to its wide direction. Now I know why a drainage snake should be in spring design: it needs to be able to turn in any direction to get into the drainage pipe with turns in all directions!I have to compliment Amazon for the easy return and even the return postage is prepaid. This is my first time returning an Amazon purchase."
5,Great,"This is one tough product. Works very well, even went around a corner seventy feet from where it first entered the basement drain pipe. Punches through tough clogs."
2,Perhaps a Sequel Was Not Such a Good Idea....,"Before I start, I want to say that Robert Silverberg is a great author, and the Majipoor books are among some of the best fantsy ever written. That said, Sorcerers is a very disappointing book. The characters are very one dimensional, the dialog is stilted, and about halfway through the book you come to the great realization that you don't really care who wins the throne. I finished the book because I love Majipoor (and it did get better as the conflict between the two claimants to the Coronol throne heated up). While I believe there are plenty of great stories left on Majipoor, this was not one of them."
3,Disappointed -- Expected Better!,"I have to say that before I picked up this book, I had never read a Majipoor novel. But I have read Silverberg on occassion, and I find him to be quite entertaining. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for this work. First off, Silverberg is an outstanding writer, one of the best in the business in my humble opinion; but this novel is long-winded and laggard, featuring characters a bit on the forgettable side. Quite frankly, I found myself bored with this novel, summoning what was left of my fortitude just to finish reading the thing."
2,Deus Ex Machina Ending,"We have the good ol' ""good triumphs through no direct action of the hero"" ending here. I really, really hate that sort of ending."
2,majipoor--silverberg's terrarium,"beware--one of the richest worlds in scifi is really only the hobby terrarium of an old pro--its all about the scenery, the sex, and the thokka (liquor-filled berries).its a great venue for short pieces (majipoor chronicles) but the novels are shameless blather--the old ""fantasy-series-retirement-plan"", i suspect.read jack vance's dying earth books instead."
1,The Author lost the plot.,"Silverberg is one of my favourite authors and I've read all the Majipoor novels.Generally I don't think the Majipoor novels are his best work and I get the impression that he churns out another Majipoor novel when he runs out of ideas for new work.But the Socerers of Majipoor is I'm afraid the worst of the series. After an interesting start the novel seems to have gotten out of the authors control and just goes on and on and on and on..... Eventually it becomes a glorified soap opera, but I won't spoil the end for those he want to read it.All I can say, he has done better Majipoor novels and a hell of a lot better other work."
4,Enjoyable book!,"I'd never read a Majipoor novel by Silverberg before, and I found this to be a fantastic initiation into this massive world. The plot grabs you from the first page, and you stay enthralled. Some characters can be a bit grating, but I found myself missing some of them when the book came to an end.It's fast paced, filled with intrigue and overall a vastly entertaining novel. I definitely recommend it."
1,broke on first use,"Arrived very quickly: in just one day after I received the email that it has been shipped. Broke as quickly.Was labelled Do It Heavy Duty Toilet Auger. Broke on first use. The rotating handle got detached from the snake spring. Had to pull out the spring from the toilet. Not as bad as other reviewer who had to call a plumber but still not very good situation to be in.Also, the snake head is rather large and hard to push down the toilet to begin with. Maybe that was because we have a new construction home with the modern water saving toilets."
4,My First Lovelace - Thumbs up,"Since other reviews have summarized the book,I won't do it again. I thought Eye of the Beholder was well written and kept you guessing to the end. The information on the runes and the processes bog down the book a bit, but I was intrigued with the military information. It amazes me that anyone would question a rescue attempt while under fire.Captain Miranda ""Randi"" Morgan is a strong character that you admire. At first I was wondering if the romance with Pete would work, but it all fit together.Ms Lovelace knows how to spin a tale, keep you in suspense, and wanting more. I am looking forward to reading her other books."
1,A Waste of Time,"Don't even bother reading this book. It's poorly written, boring, and shallow. If you're looking for some down-home, country, good-ole-boy stories and recollections...try somewhere else. I was extremely disappointed with this reading..."
3,Random power Offs,"We bought one at (competitor) and loved it. Picture was exceptional. Problem was after 60 days it started with random power offs, then 2 days later would not turn on at all. Looks like I had same problem as other reviewer. Costco took it back no problem. Have not decided if I will try it again or go with plasma."
5,Excellent TV; great value,"I bought this TV at (a competitor) and I could not be happier. Outstanding image, decent sound with HDMI hookup, and all the features you NEED. You do not need an HDTV tuner built in because your cable company can give you an HDTV box at the same price as a regular box. You also don't want the ""card"" feature offered on more expensive models because then you cannot use features of cable such as movies on demand and other items proprietary to the cable box. This is a great set and I bought the bracket from Vizio and it worked easily. I like it so much that I am buying the 50 inch plasma for the den!"
4,"Pretty Good TV, Good Value","Bought this TV at (competitor) in April, 2006. Took it home out of the box in the back seat of my car (Honda Accord 4Dr 2001). Had a few episodes of TV turning itself off sporadically...just left it alone and let it run continuously for an afternoon at a time. Episodes have since stopped, works great. Found out that the component inputs give good color but the HDMI input from the DVI output of my Time Warner Cable Box is better--a little more vibrant reds and slightly sharper still. I got my 6ft DVI to HDMI cable on ebay for $10 delivered. Monster cable fans might have a point if it were longer than that. Standard Definition TV however is ok, much prefer my Sony 32in TV for that or my Dad's 27in JVC Flat Screen TV. Would definitely purchase again especially if less than $1000 delivered."
1,"Still an alpha version, I guess","Bought three of this TV and returned all three (fortunately to a local store). Most people in avsforum have the same problems as I had:1-Random power offs. My first two units had this. And after some time, both of them never turned on.2-Blue screens when switching inputs (just like Windows). Sometimes I struggled for 10-15 minutes to get rid of this.3-Digital audio output is stereo, not 5.1. Interestingly 32"" and 42"" vizio models have 5.1 output. But this one does not.Overall, I would not reccommend this TV despite the low price."
1,Saddened,"I loved this TV, but I am very sad to report that after three months, it began to have sporadic shut down issues (where it would go into sleep mode). Now, it won't turn on at all. It's just a dark void in my living room. Apparently I would have to ship it back in it's original box to get it fixed. It's going back to (competitor) tomorrow. :-("
5,"Dr. Joe, a definite go!","I'm hooked on Joe's books! As a senior chemistry teacher in B.C., I find the gooddoctor's articles a great stimulus for discussions with, and research by, my students.If you have not enjoyed the interesting, informative and entertaining writings ofDr. Schwarcz, I suggest you do so soon! This is chemistry we can all relate to!"
2,Joe Schwarz - an author to watch out for if you have any interest in chemistry,"""The Fly in the Ointment"" and ""Let them eat flax"", (which I bought at the same time) both give 70 extremely interesting snapshots of everyday life in terms of chemistry. Some of the articles were of general interest and many debunked some rabid internet myths which abound. I have used both books as a source to add to my chemical knowledge and I find myself referring to them often.I found both books written in a very readable style while presenting the facts and I will be looking out for this author in future."
3,Not too well thought out...,"Like the original (be sure to check that one out), the first two stories couldn't possibly hold a candle to the third one. I don't think the makers of this film didn't think too much. The third story picks right up where the third story in the original left off, and the apartment from the original is completley different. Also, the heroine does the exact same things that Karen Black did to the doll in the original. NOT to well thought out, if you ask me. Only watch this one if you enjoyed the original."
3,cheesy...but fun!,"I watched this last night for the first time, directly after the original. I was expecting so much more, and got so little. The first story was ok, not even half as good as the opening in the original. It had some cheesy graphics though. The second story, although it didn't make any sense and came off to an extremely bad start, was by far the best and most suspenseful segment. It was one of the few worthwhile parts of this movie. The third segment, a sequel/remake of the story AMELIA from the original, came off to a boring start, but once that little zuni doll came to life, the fun started to roll. I was disappointed however, that the ending was a complete reworking of the original story. That was lame and showed that the filmmakers couldnt come up with anything original. it was fun to watch the little doll run though. He's the funniest thing on earth! If compared to the original, this movie is lame and stupid, but fun. If u have nothing to compare it to, you'll like it more."
1,NOT WORTH..,NOT WORTH IT. THE ORIGINAL WAS MUCH BETTER. THE THIRD SEGMENT WITH THE ZULU DOLL WAS OKAY. THE BEST OF THE THREE. I WOULDN'T EVEN WASTE MY TIME. WATCH THE FIRST TRIOLOGY OF TERROR. THE STORIES ARE BETTER DONE AND THE ZULU DOLL IS BY FAR SCARIER THAN THIS ONE. AFTER WATCHING THE FIRST TRIOLOGY WITH THE ZULU DOLL I WOULDN'T KEEP SCISSORS IN THE ROOM WITH A DOLL.
5,Mesmerising. I can't stop listening.,"The guitar comes from Spain, the singing from the heart, and the percussion from somewhere between the kidneys and the navel. Anyway, the overall effect is encompassing. WHere to find more like this?!"
5,Awesome,"What can I say. It got here fast, plays like it should and I have no complaints. I love this movie. Awesome!"
4,A must see,This movie is one that is a must see for all but especially for those growing up in the 60's and remember the dance shows from either being a participant or watching the shows on T.V.
5,Excellent crate,"This crate had everything I wanted in a crate: a cruved-up base to catch liquid, plastic bolts that will not rust, an option for tie-down, airline compliant, good construction, etc. Excellent price and arrived quickly."
1,Against the wall,"What a worthless piece of programming. Poor little me , Dad is a loser, brothers are narcassistic and MOM, what ajoke.I very rarely comment on this stuff. But your sex pot went to the ""outhouse"" on this one..."
3,Postmark Paradise,"A very unique movie, it is entertaining. It's definitely easy to tell that it's very low-budget. If you like this, you would probably like ""Birthday Girl"" and ""A Foreign Affair: Two Brothers and a Bride"" even more."
4,A Look Into A Culture That Few Americans Have Seen,"David Treuer's hand paints a landscape that is as bleak a reality as we have here in America. His characters that inhabit this modern Native American tale are so real you can see them clearly in your mind's eye. In 1969, I passed through many towns in Southern Canada bordering on the Great Lakes States and was shocked to see the level of disfunction in our Native American brothers and sisters. This novel reminded me deeply of my memories of these places and how forgotten and isolated these people are and what the result is of this abandonment. For a first novel, I think we have a lot more to look forward to from this young, and, very gifted writer."
2,Doesn't hold charge,"I went through two of these before I finally realized that Logitech should recall these speakers. A lot of people have reported that the battery does not hold a charge out of the box and after a about 2-3 hours, the unit wont turn on unless you plug it in. If you google ""mm50 blinking red light"" you'll see that many people have had similar issues. I finally just returned these for a refund."
2,Nice speaker but...,"The speaker drains the battery from my iPOD. I would plug it in fully charged. When I take it out, battery is completely drained. Anybody else experience this?"
2,Great until it stopped working,"I loved this little portable system for my ipod, and it worked great for a few weeks, then completley died. I have researched and read many other reviews of this product and this seems to be a commom problem with this unit.I would find another model."
2,3rd Gen ipod owners beware,"The mm50 just doesn't work well with 3rd Gen ipods. Unless the speakers are fully charged up, the ipod will not play. Charging the unit takes hours it seems, much longer than I was led to believe. Think the iPod will charge while attached to the unit? Think again!! It seemed that the ipod was actually DRAINED of its battery charge in no time flat.I wish I had just bought another set of JBL Duet speakers for half what I paid for these. I was also unimpressed with the sound quality. I wanted a small, portable set of speakers to use in my office.My kids have a 2nd genration Nano and a fifth generation video ipod. Clearly they will have this unit too as it is a real pain for me to use."
1,Poor Design.,"The sound was great but when I found out that once the rechargeable battery will no longer hold a charge, because it can not be replaced, it essentially becomes worthless! I could not get it to play with even the A/C adopter.I did see over the internet some people were finding ways to replace the battery, but what poor design.I will never buy another Logitech product."
4,"Great sound, poor battery life","I heard these in an Apple store and they had a noticeably richer sound than other models, and Amazon had a great price. Soundwise, I couldn't be happier. Fortunately, I didn't buy it for the battery capacity, which is VERY limited. Short usage, and discharges completely in a few days even if you don't use the speakers at all. A friend owns this speaker system and has the same issue. So as long as you use the power adapter and cord, it's a great product. But don't expect to take it on the road and have more than an hour or two of music, tops."
5,Quality and convenience,I have owned this iPoD speaker system for 6 months and have been quite happy with its quality and convenience. The sound quality is excellent for its size. It is particularly convenient because it can be operated cordless (never used up all the battery supply yet) and is small enough to carry in one hand. I also like the fact that it charges my iPod. It came with several adapters to fit a variety of iPods. The appearence is sleek and unobtrusive.
4,Great little speakers,"I got this for my daughter's new video iPod and the sound works very well. As someone noted before, it seems odd that they would not make room for the AC adapter/charging unit in the travel case since you would have to take it along for any trip, but that is the only complaint. I would recommend it to you."
4,"Good sound, worthless remote","The sound is good. I especially like the fact that they've cranked up the power on the speakers as high as they could given the friction of the rubber feet. (If played loudly, the speakers will walk off the table.) Very portable. Well-designed. Only trouble I have is the remote. It doesn't work past about 3 feet, and I've tried multiple batteries."
1,Never Recieved,"I wouldnt be able to tell you about this product because it never reached me and the best that the retailer could do for me is return my money. So I went to a local retailer and spent 150% of what I originally paid because I knew I could walk out with it. Thanks a lot Amazon. Oh, by the way, this was my first ever purchase with Amazon, and likely the last. Gee, if only we could figure out why our service based economy is failing. Curious, isnt it?"
1,The sound is great- but the logitech customer service...,"I bought Logitech 50 mm portable speakers for a trip to china. Despite the fact that in china I could get a cheaper product I didn't want to compromise on speakers. Well guess what, after the second use (in china) they stopped working. I tried to contact the company by phone and sent 4 emails to their costumer service and after a week and a half there was no reply at all from Logitech. Now I am stuck with this 100$ worthless piece of metal to carry around and a very bad taste in my mouth."
2,not good enough,This speaker is for 94 USD not good enough.. I wish to get a better sound quality for such a pricing.. The internal rechargeable battery is very good.
3,Good product but...,I really like this product. It's great for my office but after a few uses don't plan on using your firewire cable to connect to your PC anymore. Your iPod will tell you that Firewire isn't supported - you'll have to then buy a $30 USB2 cable to make it sync with iTunes.
2,Buyer beware: Great sound but very poor design leads to battery issues,"I bought these speakers in White on Black Friday from another retailer. I choose them because I thought that they had the best sound for the money (after testing several sets). I haven't been disappointed in the sound. However, I have been quite disappointed in the product design relating to battery usage. This design flaw causes the battery to be drained even when the player is not in use. So after not using it for a week, you'll find that the battery is fully drained. This is of concern because the battery is not replaceable and will not take a charge after it has been fully drained x number of times. Logitech knows this and their only solution is to tell you to plug it in at least once a week. No wonder they are cutting the price on this item. I wouldn't be surprised if it is discontinued soon."
2,Bad Base - maybe a one off,"I got these speakers posted to me by amazon - plugged in my iPod and turned up the volume. The base REALLLY rattled... so I sent them back. I tested the same speakers in the apple shop the next day and they were nowhere near as bad. So, who knows. It may be a one off.Only other scary thing with these speakers is that the rechargeable battery stops recharging (according to other people's reviews) and you can't replace it. So, if you buy them to be 'portable' ie you want to use then in places where there is no wall socket, you could eventually have a problem.All in all, they are good for the price though.Good luck!"
3,commernts,"it is a very nice system. the only fault i find with it is the volume does not go as high as i would like it too. it is good for charging my ipods, and the remote makes it easy to cut off. its a good buy if you just want to hear your muzak!"
5,Good for the house,"I got this after many research for my first ipod. Good sound in my home and in the patio. I still haven't tried it, but is suppoust to work with its rechargable batteries.... A plus!"
5,Great value for the price!,"I've had these speakers for a few months, and they have gotten a workout. I'm sure they're not as great as the Bose, but the sound is fine and for must purposes (not a party) the volume is fine too. The batteries last for time on the beach, and I've gotten way more than my moneys worth already. If I had to scrape for an improvement, it would be nice if the case had room for my ipod inside, but that's a strech. I'd buy these again in a heartbeat. They will travel with us on all our trips."
4,Great sound but poor battery,"This device is a very cool one , sound is great and loud ,remote control,Good size for this kind of sound quality.The only problem is the rechargeable battery ,won't last much and cant hold the charge."
2,"Not Portable, Battery DIES!","I got the ipod speakers, and initially loved it. Thought it was the greatest thing. You could take it with you and it could play off of battery. After a couple weeks, we noticed it would not keep its charge. As soon as we unplugged it from the wall, it would shut off. So we sent it back and Amazon sent another one. The same thing ended up happening. I am disappointed in the fact it cannot be played w/o power from wall. Be careful about the battery life on this thing. For me.....it was about 2 weeks on 2 different ones."
4,Better than expected !!,The mm50 by far out performs the Logitech pure-fi in sound quality and durability. Not as good at higher volume levels as a Bose..but that requires a power cord where ever you go...the mm50 does not...much more portable and versatile for travel..So far battery life seems good. Will know more about that in a few weeks. Battery in the remote was dead when I got it. I replaced it and it seems to work fine now but with limited range. About 20ft was the best I could get out of it and straight on.. Remote did not work well at angles to the unit. If thats the only problems I encounter..this is an awesome product.
5,Best Speakers!!,After carrying external speakers up and down and having to deal with tangled cables i decided to purchase a portable speaker sytem that will eliminate all that hassel.my prayers were answered with this logitech 50 mm speakers.not only is the sound loud for such small speakers but its combined with clarity and richness!!there also very attractive and blend beautifully with my black ipod. the only complaint I have is the battery dies after repeated use and cannot be replaced!why?doesnt make sense to me!?anyway am very am happy with my purchase and so will you!!
3,"Nice design, lousy sound","I bought the Logitech mm50 based, in part, on reviews indicating that it was the best sound among the truly portable iPod speakers. Unfortunately, I've found the sound to be poor - like a mediocre portable radio. The design of the unit is great for portability - very light, flat, nice carrying case that is included with the unit - but the sound quality is a big disappointment."
4,A Go Anywhere Portable Speaker System for your IPod.,"This portable speaker system, the Logitech mm50, has worked out great for my purpose. Light, functional, a great sound and the big bonus, cradles that let you use it with different model IPods. It's easy to use. Instructions are clear and simple to understand. The extended capacity re-chargable battery make this item great for outdoor parties where access to electricity is not convenient."
5,One of the best short story collections I've ever read,"While Black Anvil Hammer is by no means the Grapes of Wrath, it is an amazing composition of short stories. Foreman really breaks the trend of cardboard story-boarding by really allowing you to become emotionally attached to the characters in such a short period. A few of the stories seem like they do not belong, but are excellent in their own right. What is truly amazing however, is Foreman's ability to create a story that keeps getting deeper the more one reads it. The other thing Foreman excels at is creating emotions within you. You hate some characters, while you love others. You want to throw things after reading some stories; you want to cry after others. Even the ending leaves you feeling better, with a ""wink-wink"" reference. But this isn't a big ""lets get together and cry fest"". Great piece of literature overall...."
5,The bear and Mr. Bear,"This is a book I have read many times with my grandchildren. Once they donated it to the school library and I had wanted to have it again. It is a tale of freedom, of compassion and of friendship. I got the book perfectly covered and carefully handled. Thank you very much."
1,A 5 but for $100.oo?,"I should not rate a piece of literature based on the price, but as of Dec 31, 2010 this book was selling for something like $97 here - and I feel like this is a bit too much for this book, and most children's books.I flag this as a 1 here not to dissuade the purchase, but the opposite.Please see the paperback version of this book as it is (as the time of this review) only $10 and used copies for less. It is a great story and I want recommend this book via an affordable means."
3,just okay...,"it's nothing great, it comes apart easily, and it's hard to store. But... the kids love using it, so I guess it's doing it's job."
2,Not for a kid with a hard shot,"While I'm sure this product is good for kids who are fairly new to hockey, or young kids, it just doesn't hold up to a more experienced player. First of all, the velcro doesn't hold when a hard shot is made. My 11 year old son set his up last night and already two velcro straps have broken (come unsewn).As for the size net this will fit, it DOES NOT fit a full size net. The velcro straps are too short to securely fit around the metal bars. The velcro just barely overlaps, maybe a 1/2 inch. Not enough to stay secure when a hard shot is fired.The weighted bottom is useless, does not keep the goal from moving into the net when hit with a puck. The player must then go up to the net and pull the bottom straight again.The actual goal itself it fairly sturdy, but it has only been used for about an hour-maybe too early to tell how it holds up.We are disappointed with this product and will be returning it."
2,We'll see...,"Well, I must be living with Wayne Gretzky becase in less than two weeks, a connecting tab has ripped off. I am sending it back as defective (It should last longer than 2 weeks)and ordering another. I will post again after we receive out new one. Perhaps it was a faulty tab..."
5,Absolutely the Best!!!,"This is the best Extreme DVD out there! It has all of their videos, plus bonus videos & live footage. Extreme & Nuno are one of the most underrated bands out there...but they are BACK!!! So if you're an Extreme fan, watch out for them, it doesn't get any better than this!!! Long live Extreme!!![..]"
2,Not up to par...,"I grew up listening to Adventures in Odyssey and could barely wait for the next album to come out. When this one came out, I was highly disappointed. They changed the story format to include shorter stories and they are just not up to the standard I have come to expect from AIO. This album has one good CD on it (out of four) - Mandy's Debut and Passages (Part 1&2) are actually decent, but the rest of the album is not so good."
3,Hero redeems himself at the end,This book was a so-so read for me. It wasn't one of Baloigh's best but I liked the way the two main characters came together in the end despite many misunderstandings along the way. Not a keeper for me.
2,Useful in spite of serious flaws.,"Experienced C++ programmers will be able to figure out many of the typos and other errors, such as a backward typedef (p.11), a parameter name change (p.12), and == where != was intended (p.219). More disturbing are some surprisingly naive coding techniques, such as assignment operators returning void (p.318), bizarre sequences of do-nothing statements (p.312), integer exponentiation by repeated multiplication (p.329), and strange packaging of unrelated constants (p.305).Despite its serious flaws, this book contains a number of useful ideas and techniques, and emphasizes numerical techniques that are ignored by many C++ books. I recommend it as supplement to the experienced programmer's library of C++ books."
5,Awesome,Bought it for a AV gig and it did what it was made to do. Great reflective quality in a bright room with a 2.5K projector. The base and frame are flimsy but sturdy enough to be set up and left alone without worries.
2,200 recipes for memorable meals???,"The title suggests 2 things, the reasons I bought the book...3 ingredient recipes, and 200 ""meals"" Both misleading claims...in order to make the recipes any good, you need to add more things...they even suggest that..however worse is there may be 200 recipes in the book but many of the recipes are for sauces, drinks, soups, side dishes, not meals as in the title... I would not really recommend this book. Sorry."
1,Too basic,This book had limited recipes and the use of low quality ingredients. Creativity in cuisine very low. Would not recommend to anyone.
3,Deceptive Title,"I bought this book for my elderly father, who is just learning to cook for himself. He has been able to make some of the recipes, and they have turned out well. But many of them have frustrated him because either the recipe calls for obscure items not easily available in the grocery store, or because one of the ""three"" items is really a compilation of items that the author gave the recipe for in the beginning of the book and expects you to have already prepared that in advance to be used in a number of recipes throughout the book. So many of the recipes in fact have more than ""three"" ingredients. Also, there are many ""fringe"" recipes that may interest some, but won't interest people looking to make basic entrees."
1,Not for me,"Most of these recipes are based on canned ingredients. Since I prefer using natural ingredients as much as possible, this book is a disappointment. See my review of the 5 ingredient book."
2,Ingredients are too artificial for our preference,"A lot of the recipes call for highly processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives. If you want to stay away from these as our family does, give the Hildebrands' three ingredient cookbook a try. Everything I've made from that cookbook has been all natural, and delicious."
3,Good Thought,"Nice thought but the recipes aren't that good. I loaned it to my mom and she made two of the recipes and she gave me the book back. However, the recipes are definitely a good base to add your own mess to the pot. I also like how it breaks down the nutrition information in each recipe so I can follow a diet easier."
3,love the smell,I have ordered this product twice before and didn't have any problem. This recent purchase the incense sticks did not burn properly. I had to throw quite a few of them away. I will probably purchase this product again hoping it will be as previously ordered product. The incense sticks seem to be to thin.
4,Misleading?,"Many books and subjects taught should have a disclaimer stating that the information you are absorbing may not apply to the real world.The only way I see the information in this book working is in a small company on its' way up. Im not saying that the information within is alltogether baseless, however, there are more than a few times while reading where I wondered what would be my fate if I had someone with a secretive agenda within my group of subordinates and I began to let down my guard just enough for them to knife me in the back? This book never suggests looking out for oneself. Dont get me wrong, trust is good, but you cannot allowed yourself to be disarmed by it.Is the book worthy? ABSOLUTELY. All I am saying is that it should be taken with a grain of salt and not blindly adhered to."
4,Team Making,"An easy read on the basics of being a part of a team- being a team player, decision making, management, etc. Easy to follow, mostly interesting. Broken into segments that make it easy to reflect."
2,SEVENTEEN? God himself had only ten.,"It is said that when Woodrow Wilson attended the Versailles conference and began waving around his Fourteen Points, that Clemenceau of France turned to Lloyd George of Britain and remarked ""God himself had only ten."" The author would have done well to learn from this before writing and naming this book."
3,"Entertaining, but not deep","A breezy and entertaining read. The examples are inspiring, and the author makes some good suggestions as to how we can better fit as members of a team.That said, I would also describe the book as shallow; most of the vignettes and observations are surface-level, ""feel good"" anecdotes and suggestions. Meaningful change is complex, deep, and often dirty.I wouldn't consider the book to be life-changing, but it's interesting nonetheless."
3,Mostly fluff,"I've read most of Maxwell's stuff and I'm not a huge fan. This book is another in his series of ""17"" books, and I find that once again he could have combined most of them and made it the five or six essential qualities of a team player.The book is laid out systematically: name of the quality, feel-good story, 3-5 points of explanation, 3-5 points of application, next quality. It's chocked full of stories and quotations, so if you're looking for anecdotes, this is the book for you. It's a very easy read.It's not a bad book and there are a few points that I found useful, but for the most part it's just a run-of-mill Maxwell book. He's more of a storyteller. If you're looking for a good book on improving teamwork, I would recommend Patrick Lencioni's ""Overcoming the Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Field Guide for Leaders, Managers, and Facilitators""."
1,I Feel Robbed,"I just paid over forty bucks for a piece of trash. I can't believe this book is recommended everywhere as an essential cc tool for the video editor. This book doesn't have any worthwhile tutorials and the CD that comes with it is a joke. If you have any basic knowledge of video editing, you will not learn anything new. I was looking for a book that could provide any technique of color correction to achieve different styles and moods but this doesn't even come close to touching these subjects in depth. I just this to be a waste of money and time. Do not buy this book."
2,They work.............But not that well,"The first time I bought them they were broken. The second time I bought them the charger had to be forcefully smacked before it worked. The mile range is definitely not 10 miles, and not a measly 2 miles. There interface is bad. And they are loud and the volume control is hard to axces. Badly designed, and I wouldn't recommend buying them"
2,"OK, nothing more","In use I have found the mirror to be lacking. The mirror does what it is supposed to do, providing a standard as well as magnified reflection. The mirror itself is good. A friend has a lighted mirror, which I found makes a huge difference when using the magnified side. With this particular product, you need to angle the mirror just so to catch the light to optimally see. With the lighted mirror, the entire surface is lit, without the gymnastics of finding the best mirror and face angle. Find a good lighted mirror instead."
1,As bad as a movie can be,"Very bad movie, below ""B"". This could be a typical ""B"" action movie, if A. Nevski did not ""act"" in it. I bought this because I saw Michael York on the cover as the lead actor. I was very disappointed in Michael as I found out he would participate in ANY project, even as bad as this, if he is paid his usual fee.Even if you have money to waste on something, save your time and do not watch this flick."
3,quality not evenly reparted,"various authors, that is to be understood as various quality in writings"
1,One star for . . .,One star for the book -- that should go without saying -- but also one star to the blurb writers here who actually seemed surprised and disappointed by it. Hello? It's -- O.J. Freakin' Simpson! (No stars to the writers who gave it high marks. I think they should all be under surveillance.)
5,OJ is a wonderful guy and a surspiringly skilled writer,"I thought this book was fascinating. Oj is an awesome guy. I met him once, and he was as gracious and nice as anyone could be. I've believed in his innocence from the beginning, and this book really helped solidify my belief in him even further. Oj truly is a walking testament to how we should live our lives: on our own terms, no matter what the cost."
4,This book by O.J. is an honest straightforward must read.,"As I read this book, I had several personal conclusions and deductions confirmed!! This book is very honest and open for those who are looking for TRUTH AND HONESTY. Only a person who does not want the truth will have a problem with this book. Only a closed minded person will read this book and still conclude that Mr. Simpson is guilty. I was surprised that there were so many wonderful letters from GOOD HEARTED PEOPLE. So, if you are open and honest, looking for truth, please read this book and encourage others to do the same. We have a real problem here in the U.S. and it needs to be addressed by responsible people."
3,A Different Perspective,"Most of the people who criticise this book are the same people who had OJ convicted before he got accused. This book was a good read. I found the explanations plausible. For the disbelievers let me ask one question: How could OJ have possibly comitted the crime, removed the clothing, got rid of all the evidence and got home in time to catch a flight to Chicago? You would have to believe that he planned the entire thing. This is the part I find most difficult to reconcile. I believe OJ was proven not guilty. Whether he is innocent, is not for me to determine. Anybody with a brain can speculate...I can only say definitively that he was not proven to be guilty. Is that the fault of OJ?"
2,(Some of) O.J.'s side of the story,"In reviewing this book, I am not going to get into matters of Simpson's guilt or innocence. I'm simply writing this review for those O.J. trial fans who might want to purchase it to get a different perspective on the crimes.My opinion? You probably shouldn't bother. There are numerous books out there written by members of the Dream Team that can give you the perspective from the ""he was innocent"" camp. This book is merely O.J. trying to raise money for his defense (he admits it in the book). Because ""I Want To Tell You"" came out *before* the trial, there is really no information about the legal side of things or about the trial itself.Also, since O.J. hadn't gone to trial yet, there was much he couldn't discuss on his lawyers' orders. So, you get watered-down protestations of innocence, but very little specific info.Skip this book unless you want to hear O.J. protest (feebly) his innocence without any real arguments at all backing up his claims."
1,"Lies, whole lies, and nothing BUT lies","This book is clearly the most narcissistic piece of FICTION ever printed. The killer tells us about his glory days as a football player and his ""wonderful"" life with poor Nicole, conveniently omitting his no contest plea to spousal abuse and eschewing references to the 8 times Nicole called the police to settle their domestic disputes. But the most glaring omission in this trashy, exploitive book is a confession, a failure to spot the blood which will drip from his hands to the end of his offensive existence, and a complete blindness to his obvious guilt."
1,Terrible,"This book is the self-serving creation of a narcissist. In light of the evidence that came out during both trials, the book is also an extended lie.Anyone who considers this book to be an honest expose is as ignorant as the jury that acquitted Mr. Simpson. Indeed, according to a pre-trial questionnaire completed by the Simpson jurors, 75% of the Simpson jurors believed that a person is unlikely to commit murder if he excels at football."
1,"As sick, pretentious and nasty as could be.","We all know that O.J. Simpson is 1000% guilty of this horrific double-murder and that he was able to buy justice thanks to his shameless ""Dream Team"" lawyers (or liars) and their utterly despicable tactics. Despite the countless lies found here, what I find most offensive, nasty and sickening is how Simpson refers to himself as being a ""battered husband""--Say What???!!! Lies, more lies and nothing but big, nasty and fat lies."
1,A BOOK BY A MAN OUT OF TOUCH WITH HIMSLEF,I read I WANT TO TELL YOU BY O.J SIMPSON and all I have to say is that O.J needs to do is look at himslef for answers as to why he ended up where he did. It's a shame that NICCOLE could'nt be around to give her side of the story too.
2,BROKE WITHIN 48 HOURS,I'm so disappointed with this toy. My son really liked this a lot but the snap that holds the front part of the truck and the trailer together broke apart when it fell from about two feet from where my son was playing with it on a carpeted surface! the two parts now are attached by a wire and there is no fixing it because gluing the pieces together will not allow for movement of the truck when it turns which is part of playing with this truck fun.. too bad.
5,Dark Visions - awesome book,This was an awesome book and I would love to find more along these lines. seller had this to me quickly and in mint condition
1,Not even a vision of the ending for the stories,"I think one day the publisher called around to Stephen King's house and asked for the three stories which were overdue for this contracted book. Stephen obviously wasn't home and his wife or kid had to search for the stories. They found three in a drawer or something and quickly handed them over. Obviously these weren't the ones King had intended as these three stories have no ending and are obviously incomplete. They are good stories but they're like reading a novel where someone has ripped out the last hundred pages. You get really into the stories then you're left wandering what is going on. There's no closure, there's no hint that the story is about to end, questions aren't answered. The other author short stories do have endings but are pretty average. Don't waste your money."
3,Assessment section - unhelpful,"I have not yet had time to read the book in its entirety, but the assessment section at the back was very disappointing, so much so that I cannot give the book more than 3 regardless of what else is in it. It was brief and far too general. If anyone wants some help with assessment, I would recommend that you consult your teacher or the Course Companion for TOK. I will add more to this review when I have read the whole book."
5,What a Pair!,I have three seasons of this series and really like the stories. Dalziel is a hoot. Pascoe adds balance. The stories are complex enough without being over the top. Highly recommend these.
3,poor quality control,"I am fed up with so many DVDs that pixilate, stall and will not allow one to shut off the player, fast forward, or anything else. I could understand when it screws up on one machine, but when I play it on any of my 9 DVD players and two computers, and I receive a message it is skipping the damaged parts, I know it is solely the fault of the DVD. I returned one copy of this series and received another with the same problem. What has happened to quality control? Warner Bros. and BBC should be ashamed of themselves."
4,Great stories in spite of glitch with dvd.,"The first story ending on disc one was never shown because the disc stopped playing. All others were fine. Can't imagine this happening with a brand new dvd. I just happened to have read all of Reginald Hill's novels with Dalziel and Pascoe, so I knew the ending. However I cannot resell because of this. I am sure this applies only to this one dvd.Do not let my small problem keep you from watching these stories. They are excellent."
5,Important contribution,"Pollington has done it again. This work explores the Mead-Hall and its connection to old Germanic and Anglo-Saxon culture. This work is extremely important as it relates to the structure of old English and old Germanic society, ritual space, food, and domestic life.The work is well thought out and presented. I would highly recommend this book."
1,The Charger Inside is NOT for the DSC-N1!!!,"I received this item on January 24, 2007. I opened it and attempted to place the battery from my DSC-N1 into it to charge, and the terminals do not line up. This charger is NOT for the DSC-N1, regardless of the packaging and claims by the seller. I don't know if it works for the other item it claims to charge, but it says clearly inside the battery space that it is for a SONY NP-FG1, *not* the NP-BG1 battery for the DSC-N1."
2,does its job but....,I bought this charger after my original got lost during air travel - bad enough...unfortunately this charger is not making up for the loss. It does charge your battery but not by just putting it in there - the craftsmenship is so bad that I always need to use tape to make sure my battery hits the contacts and really loads...All in all it does not hold up to even the simplest expecations.
1,Waste of $$$$$$,"I like how on the cover all haynes manuals state ""based on a complete teardown & rebuild"". Yet inside, everywhere you read --- refere service to a qualified service man, technician or something like that. WHY DID I BUY THE BOOK. I have been working on cars for 47 years, tell me what I need to know. If I wanted to take it in for service, I would not have bought the Haynes.Take your $ & invest in a Motors Manual or a Chilton, you will be MUCH more ahead."
4,The reason why I buy Lonely planet Guides,"Last year I had a conference/holiday trip to Quebec (City). I bought this guide and it made my life so much easier over there. The detailed maps of both Quebec City and the Quebec Region are a big help.I used many of the recommendations in the book for sightseeing and tours. There are suggestions for the most popular places and also to get off the beaten track. Once I didn't follow the advice in the book, and it cost me extra money..... The guys have really checked out the place."
3,Not a must-have item,"It's nice to have, especially if you don't use remote release often, but it's an expensive luxury item for a Nikon owner."
2,Inconsistent Flow Rate,"The quality seems to vary from filter to filter. Some are so restrictive that the pump is unable to circulate water through them. Others work fine, and you can't tell by looking at them. I notice the difference by blowing air through with my mouth. The air goes through easily on some and with difficulty with others. I am going to start saving the bad ones and sending them back."
2,not as good as they used to be,"Even though I use ONLY filtered or purified water in the fountain, these filters clog SHUT in less than a week now. They USED to be good for a month, this is now too expensive for my budget.Very disappointed"
1,Terrible Filter,"I have had a pet waterer since 2009. I never had any problems with it.In March 2011, I had to purchase additional replacement filters. I bought these. I have used at least 4 different filters and they solidify within a week not letting any water through. Compared with the filter I had been using (they never locked up), this is terrible!I was used to the older filters so I didn't pay any attention. At least the last four times I have used the filter, within a week the water is stagnant, dirty and starts developing a glossy film.If you are interested in buying these, contact the seller to make sure this problem has been fixed - or at least keep an eye on your waterer. Thankfully my pets didn't get sick!"
1,COMPLETE JUNK,"These filters are complete junk. They are a multi-layered filter, with each layer of filtration ""supposedly"" providing a beneficial purpose. However, this filter frequently becomes clogged. The first layer of filtration is a particulate screen; good in concept - bad in implementation. The useable surface area of this screen is less than an inch in diameter, so any debris (usually food particles and hair) that falls into the reservoir bowl will clog this filter fairly quickly. It usually takes about a week to clog it up. Once it becomes clogged, the water no longer flows. Well, so much for filtered water.An easy way to unclog the filter is to back-flush it. Weekly back-flushing will extend the filter life for about a month before it has to be replaced.The filters originally came four to a pack, then three to a pack, now only two to a pack, but the price has never decreased. Ok, blame it on inflation. (Greed?)"
