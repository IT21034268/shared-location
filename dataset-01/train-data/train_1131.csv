1,Child Narrator,"I have liked most of the Diana Palmers I have read, but this one was truly horrible. The hero, J B Hammock, was a jerk from the word go, but, miraculously, he becomes every woman's dream in a matter of seconds. Then there is the narrator. I listen to audio books because of low vision, so I know what a narrator should sound like. This woman (or child) should be relegated to childrens' or teen books, as that is what her voice sounds like. She made no attempt to give the characters different voices; just the same sweet, teeny-bopper voice throughout. I will NEVER listen to another adult book narrated by Lauren Davis."
4,"Good book, to read, but not the best!","This a good book, but not one of her best. The whole book is based on Tellie's love and strongwill to make this an interesting book to read, but JB lacks of emotions bore me on some parts. Good to read, but not one of her best."
1,Same old thing.....,"If you were hoping that Diana Palmer had a great new book....save your time and money. If you have another title, just change the names of the characters and you will have it. Like the other reviewers, I too am a Palmer fan who has some of her other titles on my keeper shelf. However, in recent years, her books have all been pretty much carbon copies of each other. All of her characters are the same in every one. I would love to see her write a book just once where the hero and heroine were not somehow related, where they are not infatuated with Science Fiction, spoke every sentence with an exclamation point or use phrases that have not been used since the 70's. I would love to see another book like ""Maggie's Dad"" or ""The Patient Nurse"". Sadly it looks like we'll have to wait."
1,"Disgusted ... don't waste your money on a hateful, abusive hero","I outgrew Diana Palmer's books years ago, but when I saw that she had a new Desire book, I picked it up out of curiosity to see if she had evolved in recent years. Apparently not. I cannot believe that Silhouette would publish such an awful book. The hero in this book is simply mean, hateful, and abusive to the heroine -- yelling at her, screaming at her, demeaning her. He has absolutely NO redeeming qualities whatsoever. He's physically and emotionally abusive of her, and then in the end, he shows up with a ring and she forgives decades of abuse to fall into his arms. Please. That is so 1970! I actually read this entire book in one sitting (it's short, mind you) because I couldn't believe a book published in 2006 could be this outdated and this bad. It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion. I kept waiting for the hero to develop some redeemling qualities, but he never did."
3,Dissapointment,"I gave the book 3 stars because Diana Palmer is my favorite author, but this book was a huge dissapointment. I was looking foward to this book for a long time and I was so excited when it came out. I didn't like the characters; I knew that the hero was going to be rude, etc, but the heroine got on my nerves, and I did not like Grange he was to much in the story. Don't get me wrong I do hope he has his own story one day but he got annoying fast in this story. I still love Diana Palmer's books, but I hope in the future they won't be like this."
3,Just OK,"I didn't find this to be as terrible as some reviewers, mostly because I have come to expect DP's heroes to default to anger when they don't know any other way to express themselves. It's not pleasant to read, but I know by now that the big jerk is really in love and scared by that, and that he will come around well in the end. I guess I have read Palmer for so long that I am used to that kind of guy *from her* (if any other favorite authors tried it, I'd probably be disappointed, too). So, it could have been better, but it could have been so much worse. Her books have become like a beloved pair of old shoes, ugly and comfortable at the same time. I choose to focus on the comfort part, and I will continue to read everything she writes."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.,"I AM A DIANA PALMER FAN AND YES HER HEROES ARE USUALLY HARD AND COLD BUT I AGREE WITH ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS THAT SAY DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. JB WAS WAY BEYOND MEAN, HE WAS ABUSIVE,A LIAR, A CHEATER AND TELLIE WAS A SPINELESS JELLYFISH. IM SORRY BUT DIANA COULD HAVE DONE SO SO MUCH BETTER."
2,Actually 2.5 stars,"This is one of Diana's better recent efforts. No drug busting subplots, no mercenaries, and no criminals. But one thing pulled me out of enjoying this book as a total piece of brain candy. The military/Green Beret/linguist background of Grange. As a former service member and a speaker of the Arabic language, this section bothered me. Farsi is not Arabic, nor is it a dialect of Arabic (it's actually a seperate language, with a different alphabet). Also, it's hard for me to imagine that someone who is threatened with court martial would be given the option of ""court martial or honorable discharge"". Possibly a general discharge, but NOT an honorable discharge. Diana needs to learn how the military works before using it as a plot device.I did like the story, and it flowed well and <mostly> made logical sense. Tellie wasn't a door mat, and J.B. wasn't quite as bad as some of the other review would have had me believe."
4,Airy comfort but beware the size,"This is a light, airy, well-made reclining ""zero gravity"" deck recliner. The color ""Mandarine"" is more of a Hunter Orange, not the dull orange in the picture, so take that in consideration (my deck is tan, so it looks great.)The size is an issue; I'm 5'11"" and a bit husky and it JUST fits. If my shoulders were even wider, say, as an average sized male, this chair definitely would not fit me. I wish I'd bought the XL--this is a close fit. If you are taller than 5'10"" and if you are not a slim wraith, you WILL need the XL.It operates smoothly and the mesh is a nice polypro that sheds water and lets the air pass through. Just beware of the size issues."
4,HO Cross over track.,Works very well. You can wire the crossover track to eliminate dead zones. I am able to run HO trains through the crossover without fear of de-railment.
4,Very positive on a difficult subject,"This book I found extremely helpful when tackling a very difficult subject - dying.It was inspirational and practical, and really made one think. I have already lent it and recommended it to others."
3,Beautiful Playarea,But will your child play in it.... My son mostly liked the butterfly. He pulled on some hanging toys for awhile but by the time he could really interact with the rug he was busting out of it. You can take the sides down and make it a run but now that my son is 9 months he is off to other places around the house and will not stay on the rug. It really is pretty and so nice to have a rug with no plastic.
3,not as well written as Abe's Thief novels,"I ordered this book sight unseen because I was enchanted by the author's ""The Smoke Thief"" & ""The Dream Thief"". Although the publication date of ""The Last Mermaid"" is 2007, it reads as though it were earlier work of this very talented author, published to satisfy those readers who asked for more after the Thief novels.Even within this book, there is a clear improvement of character development and plotting over the course of the three novellas it contains, so it's worth a read, and I look forward to more by Shana Abe."
5,OOOMMMMGGG!!!!!!!!!!,"After reading some of the reviews and the summaries for this book, I assumed that it was going to be another one of those clique mermaid love stories, but after reading the book I fell in love with the book and the author!! believe me if you have a chance to buy this book .. buy it!! very original and you never know whats going to happen next !"
3,Mermaids,I enjoyed this book. All about mermaids & a truly good woven story involving the family in this book. Shanna does well in weaving your interest into the story lines of her books.. Not as good as her dragon books but worth a read.
5,the last mermaid,the most romantic stories. it was hard to put down. i have not seen three stories that are so connected so beautifully. each story gets better and better. my new favorite author.
5,"If you enjoy Rhone wine, get it!","Parker has done it again. The book give the reader exellent insight into the wine world of Rhone. Major growers are described in detail, not only covering the wines, but history as well. Later vintages are covered with tasting notes. I will not call it negative, but the book demonstrates Parkers 'tast dictatorship': He either enjoy a wine or not."
3,NLP and what it can do to you,"I know someone who uses NLP. And I think everyone should know the dangers of it. The man that uses it, would speak in a way that you would be in a trance, and tell him stuff that you wouldn't dream of telling anyone else. He uses NLP to 'con' people out of things. For example he lives in a condo for free, quite a few people have given him new cars, people give him money all the time. And the people who give him this stuff are ALWAYS women, because they find him actractive in a way that they think they're husbands can not fufill with them. But the truth of the matter is they are in a trance by him and they really don't know what they are doing. People have gotten divorces because of this man and his NLP. And so few people know about it that they have no idea what they are doing. I am writing this because I want people to know the dangers of NLP. (Beware of wolves in sheeps clothing)! Thank you Abby Feiler"
5,This book is the greatest NLP book!,"This is Richard Bandler at his best! A transcript of one of his seminar. He speaks with humour, style, and shows you how intelligent he can be in curing phobias in 3 minutes! This book is divided into chapters as Bandler explains different topics. You will see how he reframes almost every experience and situation to change people's views. How he ask questions to get information out of people quickly. Also, he can be very funny, poking fun at psychologists and explain why they do more harm than good, and why NLP is so effective. Learned lots of NLP skills which are very effective, like the Swish etc."
3,DUH!,"I actually really liked the book but didnt really gleam any information that helped me out. However, I've been avidly studying self hypnosis for about a year. I'm sure this book has the potential to help alot of people. For example if you have a relative that is kind of crazy and you would like to see why or try to fix them yourself this book might be for you. Or if your making yourself crazy with bad memories or something similar then by all means buy this book. I however didnt really get anything from this book but an interesting read. If you really want to use your brain for a change try ""Effective Self Hypnosis:Pathways to the Unconcious"" by C. Alexander Simpkins, If your looking to tap the unconcious to acheive amazing results this book will teach you how to do it. You may scoff at the price tag but buck it up and pay it, trust me you'll be glad you did."
5,simply the best,"I love self help books and read a lot of them but ""Using your brain...""by R.Bandler is the best I ever try. It's very useful, easy to read, easy to fallow and a lot of fun. And the best is it really works. I'm recomending it since to everyone who needs help this of a kind and helping people myself using his technics. More that that I got so interested in NLP so took a few course myself and got a certificate. Highly recommend it."
3,I love Neil Diamond!,"I saw these guys in concert last year and was quite impressed. The CD doesn't quite capture the rawness of the concert or the ensemble feel of the guitar, drum, stand-up bass set-up they used (too much digital blooping and bleeping for what could otherwise be very bluesy and earthy). Some good songs, but some of the lyrics don't stand up to repeated listening. And some of the acoustic guitar work is excellent, but sadly there just isn't enough of it on the CD. I find hints of Nick Drake, but then they disappear, or of Nick Cave, but then they just don't develop, but mostly of Neil Diamond, which I mean respectfully, but still Neil Diamond."
4,"Less coherent album, but consistently great songs...","This second record seems unfairly judged as the weak sibling of the lineup, but there's not a single loser here, songwise. Maybe it's a little less sure-footed as a unit?, as Bachmann clearly has a lot of directions in mind.Try ""Doctors of Deliverance"" to get a feel for this album's general tempo, or ""Every Dull Moment"" as the most finessed electric guitar in the entire catalog. All his different potentials are alluded to here, ""Surrender is Treason"" back toward the first album, ""The Rotting Strip"" toward the next Red Devil Dawn, and ""Devil's Train"" toward Bachmann's later solo record, To The Races. But ""Here Comes the Snakes"" might encapsulate the appeal of the entire body of work, both sad and stirring and so nimbly delicate.Overall, this would be the album to play later at the party, when everyone is talked out and wants to just shut up and be transported into their own private reflections, while in the company of good friends."
2,"eric, why?","this album follows in the footsteps of the first album... unfortunately. something must have happened to eric between the loafsters splitting up and before his barry black album, something bad. where is the essential great song foundations with superb lyrics to follow, you sense he is trying to hard to prove he can 'move on', and sadly he's not doing what he does best."
5,A Must Have,"All of the other books cover old versions of CORBA, but this book covers only CORBA 3.0. The examples could be better, but that's ok since the topics are so well covered. I read the first few chapters, and now I use this book as reference all the time. I highly recommend this book to any Java programmer. If you are a C++ programmer, this book can still be useful but not much."
5,Ex-Swervedriver lead singer vs. Canadian Bliss,"I picked this up for the ToShack Highway side (ex Swervedriver lead Adam Franklin's new band)... and am still pleased with the genius and quite beauty of Adam. There's even an accoustic version of a SWD song.Then I threw in the Sianspheric disc (having never heard them before), and floated away on a velvet cloud of bliss. That's about the only way I can describe them.Worthy of the $$."
1,DON'T DO IT,BE CAREFUL OF REPRESSED MEMORY THERAPY OF ANY KIND!!!! IT CAN CREATE FALSE MEMORIES AND RUIN YOUR LIFE.
5,Chessmaster 5000 Review,"I had this CD before but I somehow lost it when I saw this up for sale I jumped at the chance to buy I played a little bit of it after I bought it but now I'll play it at all, anyway I'm glad I bought this matter-of-fact I made think about playing it in a few months time."
5,WATERLOO S/T CD,Great band great reissue label...Waterloo sounds like Writing on the wall to me at times. great heavy guitar work along with a swirling B-3. should appeal to fans of heavy to medium sounding prog.....
3,Midland 4W GXT-400 GMRS 2 Way Radio,"I bought more 4 pairs with 4 rechargable battery unit: 8 handhelds. I bought them for work becasue they have great range, clarity, feature, and PRICE. All are positive, but it has some negatives: 2 units were defective out of the box. No rubber grip on sides, and is not water resistant. The design could be better."
3,Slightly Different Size,The unit is a slightly different size from the same item purchased a few years ago. Our technician had to do a bit of plastic trimming to make the connections fit properly.
1,My worse experience ever,"I TRIED purchasing this item since early November 2009 and today is December 8, 2009 I still have not gotten the item, even though my credit card was charged since November 11...I tried contacting the seller twice, no response.This is my worse experience using this site, this seller needs to be taught some professionalism when doing business. How can he/she be in possession of my money, not send the item and don't have the decency to at least respond to my inquiries?I strongly recommend that as much as is humanly possible, people stay far from this seller...Downright shame...PS: The system needs to allow for a ""no star"" rating, I tried it but it would not let me, this seller does not deserve any."
5,Very useful,"As an engineering student, I consider myself a fairly competent Excel user. That said, in the first 10 minutes of owning this book I learned four new things about Excel that I was able to apply immediately. There are a lot of great tips in this book."
5,Worked for me.,"Lot of info in this book, whoda thunk a whole book could be written on Excel formula's. Nothing else to say, just adding words for minimum word count, jeesh."
3,Excell Formulas,Decent purchase. Could be a little bit more user friendly. A huge amount of information and can be difficult to find what you are looking for but all in all a good tool.
2,"Okay, but no cigar","Typically these technical how-to books are badly written and rushed to print and I found this one to be no exception. Although it offers some helpful hints not found in other Excel guides, it is rather wordy and vague in places. Some of the sample formulas simply do not work or else are not explained fully in context. Added to this, the accompanying CD skimps on the first four chapters, making it impossible to follow along on some the exercises the author provides. In some cases, he doesn't even provide a sample table. I went out and bought a copy of Microsoft's Excel Data Analysis and Business Modeling and find this to be better written, much more comprehensive, and easier on the wallet."
4,sweet sounds,A fine offering from Olabelle. The NY based group enjoy themselves with a mixture of traditional and up to date music with a gospel/spiritual/roots foundation. If you lean towards this genre this album's for you.
3,There Is Much Better Gospel Out There Folks,"Olabelle is not a bad band. But even quasi-soulful gospel music can be found by many better musicians. This sounds like any suburban gospel group at any suburban church. Which is fine. Don't let The Band connection fool you. It's gospel music without dirt under its fingernails.While we're at it, their cover of ""I Am Waiting"" by the Rolling Stones is a bit too precious. Doesn't take much to highlite the gospel aspects of The Stones, and this song is on the hepcat end of Olabelle's demographic because it was in Rushmore. An unnecessary cover for the Starbucks crowd.Plus one star because you can probably drink beer at their shows, which you can't do with most gospel acts. Even ones much, much better than this."
5,One of the best books ever on Digestion and Disease.,"Book is well written and enjoyable. More importantly, Dr. Matsen has an understanding of disease and digestion that is both extremely effective and simple to implement. Virtually everyone will benefit immensely from integrating the principles in this book into their life. I certainly have."
4,Good Resource,"A good book that discusses the importance of the digestive system on overall health, as well as providing a good plan for eating right and maintaining overall solid nutritional and digestive function. Dr. Matsen does a nice job of explaining very complex concepts in very simple terms, often using illustrations, anecdotes and homespun humor to get a point across. Additionally he has numerous patient case studies/testimonials to reference throughout the book. A good resource."
5,Better than Uggs,"My wish for fur-lined boots, not as ugly as Uggs, was granted. I always get blisters from new shoes, but these didn't give me any blisters. These are wonderful for walking, and also nice enough to pair with a sweater dress."
2,Would Not Hold A Charge!,"I love Citizen's Eco-Drive system. I own 2 other watches with this system and they work fine. This particlar watch was defective, as it would not hold the charge and would lose time and date very quickly. I had to continuously reset the watch. I'm sure I just got a lemon with this one."
3,"Nice Book, Poorly bound","I like the book and the writing - its a nice slow look at a time past and that may come again.The construction of the book itself, however, is poor. It started to come apart the moment I started reading it. Pages just started coming out. It's a sad counterpoint to read about a time when things were made with an effort in a book made by modern publishing that clearly was just slammed together."
4,This Trail is worth finding,"This small volume (fewer than 60 pages of text) is well worth tracking down through the 'out-of- print' mechanisms. Originally a lecture, the book introduces Piero della Francesca as a ""reclusive, silent, rather taciturn friend"", but a friend nonetheless. Mr Henessey's rounded analysis and warm descriptions of both the painter and his paintings certainly allow the reader to establish a relationship with Piero. Depsite the author's slightly disparaging remark about ""tourists in their rented Fiats"" following the Piero della Francesca trail, I urge travellers (Fiat driven, armchair or others) to increase their knowledge, appreciation and sheer enjoyment of Piero by slipping this volume into their luggage or onto the bookshelf. The book is usefully illustrated."
5,Great gloves,Use them for everything in the garage. Good for holding on to small things as they aren't too bulky. I also played catch with the football with my son and felt like an NFL receiver. Caught everything he threw at me. Might wear them in my next flag football game.
5,Simply the best.,"I have orderd from this vendor twice. They deliver on time. The product is absolutely delicious. Happy, happy."
5,Fun and emotional,"This story is about a young man named Rin. Rin lives with his friend Kaede. Both of them lost their mothers in an accident, and Kaede takes care of Rin's every need. It looks like they will always be together, until a couple of princesses form other worlds show up and ask him to choose one of them to marry. There is also a classmate named Asa who is gunning for his affections. After things start to settle down a young girl comes from the demon world to live with Kaede and Rin, making everything even more crazy. With all these really great ladies after his attention Rin must choose one, and break the others hearts.This story is very good. It's a great harem style anime with lots of awesome characters and plot twists. It is also very emotional. The last 6 episodes or so are really heavy. The animation quality and voice acting are also very good in this anime. I enjoyed every minute of it. I hope you do too."
3,Stick with the original novella,"Longyear's ""Enemy Mine"" is such a wonderful piece of work on its own - I don't see why it had to be mucked up like this. This book expands on the war presented in E.M., making it one story in a framework of humans attempting to settle the universe, repeating history in the process. Two short stories and a framing sequence have been added which, while not too bad, are nowhere near the standard of the original. By putting E.M. in this context, its impact is lessened."
3,Disappointing,"I didn't go through the rest of Alburt's CCC Series books (though I read and liked his 300 Positions). I'm right around 1600 USCF. I don't expect King in Jeopardy to be as comprehensive as Vukovic's book, but it's still pretty disappointing. The advice given is very basic (e.g., try not to move pawns in front of your king); the analysis, variations and quizzes are at a much higher level. You can argue that that's how chess is -- it's all about calculation -- but then, why not get a book on problems?"
3,I Still Wit It,"I have all of Bruthaz Grimm cd's and I have put some time on my decks enjoyingthem.Operation Kill A Pimp is my favorite. This project serves it's purpose, I would have liked to hear a more aggressive flow but I can't judge dude I'm saying.A lot of this was mid tempo which enables his story telling to flourish. ""YOU KNOW RIDE TO VIBE TO "" When i saw the title and thought uh huh."
5,Warstrider,"Howdy folks, have been looking for this book for a long time to complete my set and have finally done so. This is a magnificent novel which is well written with compeling characters and very interesting science features. I thoruoghly recommend this book to any avid scfi fan.Live long and prosper!Kransky"
2,Unrealistic and Useless,This collection of sound effects is trash. Many of the sound effects are usless and most are unidentifiable to listeners. There are much better effects available out there.
1,Sorry I got it,"Read the one review,five stars,have no clue as to why.It is a piece of JUNK.First the handle closes on my fingers continously,next it barely heats ,even on high,very poor steam.The teflon soleplate is rough and drags on the fabric.I wasted my money on a piece of trash from China. Hope this does someone some good.BEWARE"
5,heeleys shoes,my son is 9 years old and loves these shoes he wears them most of thetime. well worth the money .
5,WONDERFUL book for those that are grieving,"As a survivor of my son's death in 2001, this book was given to me by an acquaintance. It has helped me over and over. During the initial stage of grief when it is hard to focus on much of anything, the one-page topics really trigger you to think and help ease the pain. The phases of grief are very much like the changing seasons; the author does an excellent job making this reference. It is an excellent read as far as logic and spirituality. I would highly recommend it for anyone."
2,Interesting ideas but diluted in poor fiction,"The critique of society contained in Eclipse of the Sun is not new. Huxley and Orwell have already blazed the trail and unfortunately Michael D. O'Brien does not explore new territories.In fact, he does not even go as far as these authors. But the major flaw of the book is its style. It is poor because Micheal D. O'Brien has pre-conceived ideas and uses words only to convey these ideas in the form of a novel. An essay would have been more appropriate and might have allowed him to face his own intimate dilemma more squarely: ""am I or am I not some kind of pathetic reactionary ?"" Eclipse of the Sun does not answer this important question."
3,Doesn't fit my Shure M95ED,"This is probably a terrific headshell, but my M95ED requires mounting screws longer than those supplied by Stanton or Shure. My M95ED fits fine in the original headshell for the turntable, and in a previous Dual turntable."
1,"Prompt Customer Service, but still no product","I ordered this replacement headshell at least 2 months ago, and it is still on ""backorder."" I eventually emailed the company, and fortunately got a response the next day, but the message was no different; the item was on backorder. Eventually, I purchased another replacement headshell from Platinum Records, (in the store, not online). Unfortunately, that particular model didn't fit with my turntable. I am not sure if the one I ordered from JR will fit either."
2,A reasonable text,This book is a standard text for International Trade Law Unit at The Australian National University. It is quite adequate for this. However I find its Canadian bias towards America bashing a bit tedious at times and I think that it oversimplifies the economic analysis.
1,pure garbage,"Roy Masters stumbled upon a hypnotist's arm levitation measure and ingeniously saw its power as a meditation tool. Brilliant! Then he started talking about it, sometimes preachy, sometimes messianic--always too much. If he edited his exhausti-slop from 300 and 400 pages to 30 and 40, then something could be harvested. Best bet is to listen to the 30 minute description and walk thru of his exercise on the official website. Nothing more need be or should be added."
1,Dishonest book,"I've heard about LW in the specialized press and because of his indicator %W.I have been very disappointed by this book. There is something dishonest inside and outside of it. The title says ""day trade futures online"", in fact LW doesn't talk about day trading but about short term swing trading lasting 2 to 3 days !He presents lots of wining systems which show quite good performances but mentions nothing about stoplosses nor exits. As we know, exiting a position is far more difficult than entering a trade. Believe it or not, the chapter about exit lays on less than 2 pages!Disappointing..."
1,Shame,"I do not know why he decided to recycle his ""Long Term Secrets to Short Term Trading"" book. He is selling the same old stuff in a new book cover with a different name. Even the examples and the explanations of his setups are word to word the same. Nothing new at all. Shame on the publisher and shame on him too, for their disrespectable act. No need to buy the book."
2,Dejavu,Larry's books are generally fascinating and well worth a read. However this one struck me as being a rehash of Long Term Secrets to Short Term Trading. Both are good reads but if you've got one don't bother about getting the other.
2,Recycled material with plenty of filler,"Yikes - who edited this thing? While there are a few gems, I felt like I was reading a book with half the pages missing. Clearly, material is taken from his other books and recycled for this one, but he might have checked to make sure that all the referenced graphs and text were actually in the book! Numerous times I was flipping around to try to find a chart he was talking about, only to find that it wasn't anywhere in the book. You get the impression quickly that this was churned out to scrape in some extra dough. Larry's writing style is ""conversational"" - and that's a charitable way to describe it. Despite all these flaws, there is some good info, and some good trading ideas, but I can't recommend it."
1,REGURGITATION OF OLD MATERIAL,Rather like a patchwork quilt this book is simply constructed from re-arranged sections of previous literary efforts of the same genre.And then written in haste.If you have read any of this authors previous works then you do not need this patchedwork tome.
2,Larry's system is weak compared to Toby Crabel's,Larry gives no meat in this weak thiny book.If you really want to learn more- read Toby Crabels articles or books - much more informative and usefull.
5,So much for so Little!!,"This book is worth having for the Money Management techniques alone!!Some of the chart patterns have been around for a while and are good stand alone, but when coupled with some of his other easy to follow analysis ideas makes this a must read for all traders whether it be end of Day or Intraday. This book contains vital information that Larry normally only discloses in his Million Dollar Challenge Seminars (MDC 2000). He gives examples of these techniques in action -not just selected winners- but a whole year of take you by the hand trading examples. Momentum indicators, %R all uniquely blended in an easy to follow daily trading ritual. Excellent and enjoyable."
2,Nothing New Here,"This book is a little overpriced and does not have much new material in it for the moderately experienced futures trader. Lots of covert marketing and advertising material taking up space and general explanations about the futures market instead of specific trading techniques makes this a thumbs down overall. But, Mr. Williams has published several other very good texts explaining in detail and with examples his Williams %R indicator and his Ultimate oscillator. I would peruse the first chapter of this book on Kindle before buying."
5,"It's not always needed, but it's always fun!","The fog wipers are great when you're all fogged up, and they are easy to hide when you don't need them, they're great.What's even better is to paint them red or something and freak out your friends with your red underwater googly eyes!"
3,not very satisfied,"In fact they do work...until they fall off.Maybe they work for snorkeling, but for scuba diving, when you are in a boat, and you are holding quite a lot of equipment, the wiper simply dissapeared. I believe the magnetic wiper got atracted by other metalic material next to it, because we were not able to find it again on the boat.This said, the wiper itself works, it nicely wipes the fog from the glass, so if you are snorkeling, or diving from the beach, just pay attention to the mask, or put the wiper on it in the very last moment, just before going to the water."
3,Helpful!,I like these low-tech solutions to inner mask fogging. They are cheap and functional. However the felt side does wear thin and become less effective over time. I like the item enough to buy replacements.
1,Not Needed,"I bought two (2) sets of these for my snorkel masks. Within the first day of snorkeling, they either fell off or were knocked off in the Caribbean Sea. We resorted to spitting into the mask to keep the fog off the lens and this worked perfectly."
3,The Boy Who Spoke Dog,"Truly disappointing. This book, though well-intentioned, falls short of what I find to be compelling YA writing. There is a sense of illogic in this book and ""over-writing"" in many of the scenes within.Relating the tale of a boy tossed from a ship during a storm (why?), THE BOY WHO SPOKE DOG is meant to be the story of the boy, Jack, and the dog Moxie. The intention is that the chapters alternate between Boy chapter and Dog chapter, but after about ten chapters, that falls apart. Despite some strengths in progressing the story, in the last fifteen pages, suddenly the Boy can telepathically speak with the dogs. Huh? I know it's THE BOY WHO CAN SPEAK WITH DOGS, but the sudden shift in story focus does NOT work.Of the books on the 2006-2007 Sunshine State book reading list, this one disappoints the most for me.3 generous stars out of 5 from me."
5,My 9 year old son loved this book.,"I am a mother of two sons, ages 9 and 3. We read this book for eldest son's book club. He enjoyed it and asked to read ""just one more chapter"" constantly. I personally thought it was drawn out too long. The story of a boy who learns to love and give love through the setting of being abandoned to an island habitated by wild dogs, sheep dogs (and sheep). There aren't any fowl words, suggestive scenes or common crud that too often shows up in children's literature so I am thankful for this book. Over all I give it a 5 stars because it's clean fun, suspenceful reading that grabbed my childrens interest."
2,Sweeper to Saint,"The stories are somewhat interesting and supposedly ""enlightening"" (whatever that means), but I found them repetitive and far too simple overall. There is almost no character development and most of the ""plot twists"" are utterly implausible and abrupt. I understand this isn't supposed to be a typical fiction but I was disappointed nonetheless."
5,If you've read everything try this...,"For the past twenty four years I have been a researcher and student of the mysteries and sacred teachings of life..my own practical intuition and breakthrough coaching practice keeps me searching for ""beyond common knowledge"" material...and the clarity of the Messiah Seed and its accessibility to any level reader is outstanding.In brief, if you would like a potent shortcut to EXPERIENCE immediate clarity on who you are I recommend the book highly.Congratulations if you should choose to purchase it.Sue StebbinsPrincipal, Clinical Hypnotherapist and Audio Authorwww.successwaves.com"
4,Sounds good,"If you like the show you are going to like the soundtrack. I think Alexz Johnson's voice is interesting and like listening to it. The lyrics for some songs are a bit ""young"", but I also know that I am a bit older than the typical viewing audience. The album is fun with pretty music."
5,Loved it,"The thing is when you find a song on this album that you like, you're going to absolutely love it. I like majority of the songs, and I can listen to the other ones without a sudden need to change the song. Great Buy!"
3,Everything I expected,"The book is in good condition and an interesting read. Skye entranced me and there are few non-fiction titles about it, so this has been very useful for my research"
2,Not so great,"This DVD is mostly music critics analyzing various Beefheart albums. Some of the biographical material is interesting. The performances aren't. You'd be better off getting a copy of the excellent BBC documentary. A bootleg called ""Portable People"" has that documentary plus some nice live footage."
2,Still Never Before Available,"You know, I got this DVD thinking maybe I'll get to see some ""rare musical performances never before available on DVD"" as they printed on the back cover. They only play a piece of these videos. So if you are looking to see some footage of the band performing at least 1 song in it's entirety this isn't the one for you. I did enjoy the interviews w/ past band members and their insight to the songs and albums. I only wish if they couldn't get Beefheart himself for an interview couldn't they find some old footage of him talking about some of these great albums.This isn't a DVD that I will play often. It's a shame. I think the Captain would be disappointed w/ the DVD."
2,Not enough music..,"...although it is subtitled ""A Critical Review"". Skip over the pompous British critics and enjoy the too-short music clips. But it's always refreshing to hear John French. He always has some new stories about his years with Don. Worth a look, but hold out for the John Peel BBC documentary mentioned in other reviews."
2,Where is the Captain?,This could have been a great dvd. The band interviews are interesting. I agree with the other reviewers that it would have been nice to have the performances shown (or available in the extras) in full. The Brit critics are unintentionally funny. But what is missing is an interview with Beefheart himself.
3,Great read,"Was another winner from Raymond E Feist. Great side story as a step away from midkemia with both new and old unforgettable characters, a must read :)"
5,Sumptouos Storytelling In An Exotic World,"This is a wonderful book! Full of political intrigue, love, greed, and just about everything to make this a rewarding read of fantasy and sci-fi! Lady Mara of the Acoma is the brilliant Ruling Lady who happens to thwart and conquer just about anyone who tries to mess with her. Introducing Kevin, her barbarian lover, and the old cast, including Nacoya, Keyoke, and her son and Spy Master. It is a must-read! She might seem harsh at times, and she gets all goody at the end, but all in all it is a wonderful wonderful book! --Phoenix King"
5,Brilliant!,"A truely wonderful story that totally sucked me in from the first word. How the authors managed to spin such a complex, exciting and interesting story is amazing to me. Mara is someone I would like to know and call a friend. Highly recommended to people who enjoy a bit of romance and adventure."
3,Overdone and Unbelievable,"Coming from one of my favorite authors, this book was a disappointment. Though the concept of the Tsuranni culture is interesting, the writing seems overdone, with constant references to ""protocol"". The first book in the series was pretty good, but this one starts the downhill slide and I almost didn't finish the third one. Jany Wurts may give some insights to the female aspect of this book - which is admittedly much more developed than in most Fantasy novels, but in other respects the series can not begin to compare with Feist's classic Riftwar series. I'll still read anything written by him because that series was so amazing."
5,Evangelical Christians Would Do Well to Read This,"A fascinating and disturbing account of how several well-meaning evangelical leaders in Britain and America have attempted to gain ""respectability"" for the church in the world - either by forming ecumenical coalitions with mainline denominations, or adapting the mindset of the academic arena. In the process, Murray argues, the authority of Scripture and the gospel message have been greatly compromised. Some will be greatly perturbed by many of Murray's conclusions, but they mustn't dismiss them without coming to terms with his forceful, well-researched arguments."
5,The pleassure of enjoy them live,"Brad Mehldau, Jorge Rossy and Larry Grenader conform the best and unique modern jazz formula, just like Coca-Cola no other indredient can supply any of this three basic elements named ""Brad Mehldau trio progression"" if any component would be changed the taste would be never the same, this time this unique ensamble perform in a cut-breath way their most precious pieces from ""introducing Brad Mehldau"" thru ""Elegiac Cycle"" all pieces played with great entusiasm and improvisation, Mehldau never plays the same twice and this is so refreshing , you never know whats gonna happen when you see them live, is almost like a very enjoyable suspense. Art of the Trio, Vol. 5 is the most essential piece in live Mehldaus albumsHM"
2,Too simpler a sampler,"The main fault of THE SAMPLER isn't it's playlist, which is perfect for introducing newcomers to the classical genre. Rather, this CD is a failure specifically due to inadequate musician skills. The soloists in particular sound fairly dreadful. On the full orchestral selections, the wrong instruments get emphasized, and there's a total lack of expression and nuance throughout. To listen to these, one would think that all classical music is lifelessly dull and trite, and of course IT ISN'T!MADACY blows it again. Not recommended. (1 stars)"
1,hackneyed choices,"The selections in this classical sampler are a bit cliched. Item: Pachelbel's Canon, Rossini's William Tell overture, Strauss's Emperor Waltz. If I were to give a cd sampler to entice anyone to classical music, I definitely would not choose this poor, uninspired collection. Any beginner would immediately come away thinking that the classics are is stale and boring, mere accompaniment to bugs bunny cartoons. The disc simply does not give an exciting impression. I'd choose a collection that features exciting and shorter compositions (perhaps a Paganini caprice, a Chopin etude, any Mozart sonata or concerto, a Bach cello suite--anything that rocks!!!) Furthermore, this cd has only ten tracks. Tsk, tsk. Classical music-whether performance or composition-is too overwhelming a field of human activity and achievement to be triviliazed by such a tasteless ""sampler"". Stay away."
5,Beaded Seat Cushion,"I didn't believe it, but this is a great cushion and looks good too. Looks great in my Rav 4."
4,it's alright,I'm giving it a 4 because there aren't many on amazon. It covers my whole seat. It does get pretty hot in the summer so I don't know if it helps that which is what I got it for in the first place. I need a/c seats for georgia summers.
3,"Okay, but short connectors and cheap hooks","The beads are nice and comfortable, but the cushion is way too small to fit my Honda Pilot driver seat. Also, the too-short elastic straps and cheap plastic hooks aren't impressive, either. The straps are so short, I have no idea where they are supposed to attach. I think the directions said to connect them to the back straps under the seat, but there's no way that would work. I ended up shoving the bottom straps through the back of the seat and hooking them to whatever they would reach. The front straps I had to unhook completely."
2,beaded seat cushion,The actual colour was nothing at all like the color displayed online. I would not have ordered the product if I had had a true image of it.
1,I've had it for two weeks and I'm not happy - not happy at all.,Why am I not happy?1. Either the directions were incorrect or it did not come with all of the straps described in the directions to tie it down so I had to improvise.2. I've had it for less than two weeks and the stitching is coming apart - not just a little bit - a lot!3. It is really not the color that the picture leads you to believe it is. I have a gray interior (like the seat in the picture) and this cushion is tan with brown trim.4. I've already purchased a different cushion from a different company as a replacement.
4,Good but needs a better way to secure it.,"I love the seat but the short elastic straps will not reach each other under the seat as shown in the illustration for ""installation."" If they'd fix this problem it would rate 5 stars."
4,"Comfortable, but...",The two front straps holding it down snapped off within a week. I am still using the product just fine withouth those straps though. It's a great product for a great price.
4,seat cushion,product quality wwas ok but wasnt as portrayed in pictureshowed a gray one in the pic and when it camme it was tan
4,Loudness Birthday Eve Remastered,"This is Loudness' debut album from 1981. Although the music has a 70's sound and feel, it sounds great nonetheless. This 24-bit remastered release includes two extra tracks: 'Burning Love' and 'Bad News' -- these bonus tracks are worthwhile, and pretty much on par with the sound of this album. Although I have no trouble listening to the entire album, 'Loudness' and 'To Be Demon' are my favorites from the original release."
3,Good product for price.,"Not amazing, but good enough to breath some new life into RTII for only $10."
4,Simple and easy to use,"I run the RT88 on 3 of my bikes, and have done for several years. I like the simplicity and low price. I have had no problems with reliability. Battery life is good. I've ridden centuries and large group rides in many locations in northern California and haven't had any problems with interference. This unit has everything I need, nothing I don't, it's cheap, reliable and easy to use.I use more sophisticated units such as Cateye double and Polar on the indoor trainer when I want lots of data, but for road use, I found the Vetta is ideal."
4,Works fine,The only drawback that I have found is that I have to remember to press the right button to wake it up at the start (or after a long stop).
4,Addictive,"Like any reality show the power lies with the editors, so you have to take everything with a grain of salt. That said this show is fun and addictive to watch. It's an inherently interesting business, and the people are different enough that there's something there for everyone."
3,Good addition to library,"This is a good resource, although I prefer Uva's Weeds of the Northeast mainly because of its superior pictures. Some of the pictures in this book aren't very helpful for identifying plants. For example, I couldn't recognize first-year burdock leaves from the pictures. Some common northeastern US weeds are missing too, although that complaint can't also be made from the Uva book. The writeups are good though, and I'm sure it'll be a reference I'll use."
4,A great reference guide for city & rural gardens & farms!,I'm a city gardener and found this book amazing in telling me what wasn't suppose to be growing there. Appears to be written as an agricultural reference but great for city folks too! Never knew weeds were so beautiful! Lovely photographs!
2,A Disappointing Bible of Weeds.,"Photos tend to be dark and not in sharp focus. The dark photographic backgrounds make it especially difficult to see the adult plants clearly. Line drawings would have been helpful, perhaps necessary, if the reader is going to use this book for weed identification. Information on specific weed control would have been a helpful addition."
3,"Good, but not the best.","I found this book to be helpful in identifying the 'weeds' in my region of the Pacific Northwest. However as a university level botany student I have learned that not all the binomial names in the book are correct. Best advice to confirm id with the USDA plant website, or with Hitchcock. I really liked the info on seed viability and sprout photos."
5,One Grease By Slick 50,Better Power Equip of Vt (Dave) recommends this for cub cadet decks. Their spindles are very sensitive and you need a good grease or they breakdown. Following his recommendation I use slick 50 One Grease and it has greatly extended the life of the spindles. Just wish cub made their stuff better. Shamefully poor engineering on their 7264 Diesel.
2,Out of date,"The bookkeeping steps described are still sound. But it's so old that there is no mention of the tremendous help computer software can be. The examples used feel old-fashioned. And the prose itself feels not just out of the '70s, but even the '50s.Again, I can't fault the writer on the fundamentals of bookkeeping, but this book is TOUGH going."
5,Great pieces,Great pieces to add on to any set. Great way to add on to the standard designs to create something new and different.
5,"Newness Ends Rocks, but so did Bedhead.","The New Year/Bedhead have always rocked. People who insist on pigeonholing them into the slowcore stuff obviously stop or forward through all of there songs after hitting the half way point. Listen to Whatfunlifewas and tell me that Bedhead didn't rock. They start slow and build to a quite rockin' crescendo. That said, The New Year do ""rock"" more then Bedhead in the traditional sense. The Velvet Underground is mentioned a lot as an influence for Bedhead. It has come much more to the front with The New Year. There is no doubt that many of these songs are influenced by VU/Lou Reed, especially Gasoline. This is such a great guitar rock album. Anyone into slightly off kilter rock music will love this album. It has its gentle slow moments for sure, but listen to Gasoline or the last three songs of the album for proof that The New Year/Bedhead can take it up a notch when they want to."
5,Ombra Ginger & Lime Bubble Bath - WONDERFUL!,"Ombra produces the finest bubble baths available, with quality ingredients........and wonderful natural aromatherapy properties....If you like the clean citrus smell of lime, with a tiny tinch of musky ginger, then you'll LOVE this product! 5 STARS IN MY OPINION!"
1,This is pure BS!!! Shame Nat Geo.,"I am IN THE VIDEO all throughout it -- which was a 1989 TV show -- and in which Nat Geo keeps updating the copyright to make you think it's NEW. Lies. Lies. Poorly researched and also -- they fed live mice to the cats on camera to get them to kill those mice. Nat Geo also fed live prey animals to African predators all those years to make us witness kills. They are a fraud and nobody seems to care. I tried to stop the airing in federal court in 1989. They sent in 6 lawyers from Washington DC to argue against us -- and we were never allowed in the courtroom! A total FIX. I am not hiding. My name is Leo Grillo -- I am founder of www.deltarescue,org. Nat Geo -- if I am wrong -- sue me!"
5,Winterhaven Solution,Winterhaven Solution is a rapidly moving tense story that culminates in a great finale. The book is a romantic adventure murder mystery with a significant undercurrent of religious hatred and fanaticism. It is suspenseful throughout and maintains interest at a high level. I highly recommend reading this contemporary and thought provoking novel.
2,"Well written, though politically conservative with a few minor errors.","I found the book to be well written, the author obviously knows his material quite well.However, the author seems to be politically conservative, his viewpoint slips through in his bashing of JFK and Clinton and in other areas. That said, once I realized that political orientation of the author, I was able to put it aside and get to the meat of the matter. The author's discussion of the Baldrige process obviously comes from his extensive experience as an award examiner. His discussions of how corporations have used the Baldrige process were quite illuminating.When I looked at the source material the author quotes from, I found one misquote and a botched bibliographic reference. For this, I blame the publisher for failing to properly fact check the book. I guess $126.67 list price does not buy much these days.The cd material is rather ho-hum, it consist of example spreadsheets and videos."
4,"Well, my friend loved it, why don't I?","Well, I got this as a present for my friend. The shipping was extremely fast. It was the 3rd item i ever got on amazon, and it came first out of the other 2. So, I gave it to my friend the next day, and he was pretty happy, assembled it, and yeah. The next day, he said he was shooting it, pretty fun, but sometimes the bullets would curve, he said overall, He said it was pretty good for a spring airsoft gun."
5,A grown man has a toy soldier stuck in his nose ...,"Mike Smith is that substitute teacher you had in high school, the one you were certain didn't know what he was doing, and were pretty sure he was in the bathroom writing weird graffiti in the stalls. Trained in English, Mike is given a long-term assignment in an Algebra class, where he shows movies and asserts his authority randomly and to mixed results.Mix these stories with a good dose of Mike's own upbringing in Fairdale, Kentucky, and you've got one book full of dead floating cows, a 30-year-old neighbor with a toy soldier lodged in his nostril, and a man named Uncle Malcolm. Tell Christian rocks the mic."
4,A book which is for the contemporary woman,"This is a sensitive book which speaks to the women of our day by personalizing some well-known and some not-so-well-known women of the Bible. I was astounded at my real interest in the behind-the-scenes possibilities in these women's lives. How many of you have even WONDERED about the Samaritan Woman at the Well? In this book, she may come alive for you. The opposing personalities of Mary and Martha are presented so lovingly. A very long chapter told from the point-of-view of Mary, the mother of Jesus, takes you right into her bewilderment, embarrassment and agony. This is an excellent book for study and discussion with footnotes on history, geography & culture of the times in which these stories took place."
5,A fresh and powerful look at women's role in the Kingdom,Six New Gospels is an insightful and intellectual view of the role of six of our most well known women of the bible. The author has done an outstanding job of bringing them to life. She is able to pose the essence of what these women might truly have been. Her style is clear and inviting. I was moved to tears by the power and the possibility presented in the story of Mary of Bethany. What a gift for women of faith everywhere!
3,Looks good...,This item looks good on my dog and my dog loves it however one of the velcro straps felt apart after 2 months. So it didn't hold up as long as I would have liked.
1,Noisy and worthless,"I would give it zero stars if Amazon permitted it.Save your money and get something else. For $200 you can get something fairly decent. This thing literally makes noise. It has a humming sound. It is also apparent in what is audible through the mix. Perhaps I had a defective one, but these things are prone to being noisy. Buyer Beware!"
2,"WAS good, then...","I enjoyed this little guy for the first month I had it. Then, the tube fried or something. Turned it on one day and smelled like something was burnt, and the only thing coming out of it was really distorted crackles. Sure seems like at least a blown tube. Tubes are delicate, but come on, had this thing just about a month and it already fries. Really annoying. I had just thrown away the shipping box, too. I'll contact ART support and see how they are. Really looking forward to packing, shipping, waiting, trying again with this NEW product. I'll leave another review after I see how their support is."
3,LOS YAQUIS UNA NOCHE ROMANTICA,"ACTUALLY THE WHOLE CD I HAVEN'T HEARD IT I JUST RECOMMEND ONE SONG, ACTUALLY I ONLY LIKE ONE SONG UNA NOCHE ROMANTICA BECAUSE IT SAYS EXACTLY THAT ONE ROMANTIC EVENING TOGETHER DRINKING WINE, BEFORE THEY SAY GOODBYE. VERY GOOD SONG I RECOMMEND IT."
4,A hopeful and transforming read for a shaken world.,"The people of the Soi 4 community live over swampland in Bangkok and they are all threatened with eviction from their poor homes. Against his will, interaction grows between them and Tony, the heavy drinking, wheel-chair bound, self-hating, emotional wreck from the Vietnam War who has hidden away in the community to escape his nightmares. In the struggle to save their homes and stand up for a fair and just solution, members of the community have to face themselves, their strengths and fears and the meaning of hard won friendship....I used to live in Bangkok and found the images of this community so well drawn that I forgot I was reading fiction and felt that I must have known these people. I was reduced to tears by the risks they took and hurts they suffered in striving for life-saving friendship. This book gives much food for thought on how the world's damage from war and greed might be transformed."
2,Too Hard to Find The Clips!,This one is probably not worth your money! There is no easy way to find the clips and each disc has 99 tracks. There is no logic to the order of the sound clips. Cheaply Done!!
2,Not my style,"I cannot recommend this book. I did not enjoy it, and found its style largely rambling (poorly written), and making few points of interest to me. If you have a deep background in English literature or linguistics, this book may be of interests to you, provided of course you are a Tolkien fan. For the rest of us who are neither, I would recommend instead the works of Ralph C. Wood ""The Gospel According to Tolkien""The Gospel According to Tolkien: Visions of the Kingdom in Middle-earthor Richard Purtill's ""J.R.R. Tolkiien: Myth, Morality and Religion.""The J.R.R. Tolkien: Myth, Morality, and ReligionI preferred Wood to Purtill, but both are informative, and in my mind much more engaging and clearly written than this work. There are a few interesting insights here, but amidst too much empty and rambling verbiage."
3,Echo valey 4241s double halo Illuminarie sun catcher,"The overall shape is great....but it does not glow. Hawaii has lots of sun and no glow, it does look good hanging."
1,Do NOT Buy!!!!,"Do not buy this product!! We bought two of these, one for us and one for our daughter for Christmas. We used ours once. It was way too hot, even though it was on low. And a few hours into the cooking, we opened the lid to stir the contents, and the hinge shattered into small pieces. The screws from the hinge fell into the interior of the appliance and are now rattling around the heating elements. Dangerous!! We will NOT use it again. We will return the one we have used once, and we will return the one we purchased for our daughter. I should never have purchased a slow cooker without checking on what other consumers think of it. I would have given the product a ""no star"" rating if that had been possible."
1,Burned,"I love crock pots, I make so many meals in it! When I got married last year I was so excited to use this new crock pot for all the new features. HA! Today the lid literally broke off at the hinge AND at the point it connects in the front and I got scalded when trying to pry off the glass lid. NOT good. I am throwing this one away. I do not reccomend buying this style of crock pot ever. Unless you don't like the person."
1,Junk,"While shoping in a local store, I bought this crock pot on impulse, The store did not have one set up on display, so bought it upon the 'box facts' and the knowledge that our other Rival crock pot had given us years of good service. When I got home and unpacked this unit it took me all of 30 sec to relize this was a cheap piece of junk, and would be lucky to last a month. Thankfully I packed it back in the box, did some checking on Amazon, confimed my suspicion's of junk status by the other user reviews. I then found a highly rated Hamilton Beach, which I ordered from Amazon, and at a later date got a refund on my impulse buy. This is a piece of junk, never even used it so can't comment on it's cooking abilites. But can say the lid would even lock down flush, also the plastic locking clips almost broke on the first use. I will now steer clear of Rival, I know they make better units, but still it is their name that is on it!"
1,First Crockpot I've used that burns food!!!,"I bought this Crockpot at Wal-Mart and cooked one of the recipes from the booklet that was included (pork chops with rice). The lid did not fit securely - it left gaps in the front and back allowing steam to escape. When I came home the food was burnt, but only on one side of the crockpot. The heating element must be uneven. I didn't try any other recipes, just returned it to the store!"
1,"HORRIBLE crock pot, DO NOT BUY!","I bought this crock pot at Target on sale for $30 a few months ago. As others have mentioned the lid did not fit securely. I was sent a ""replacement"" crock pot. The replacement crock pot lid was fine although very difficult to remove to clean. Today the hinge broke. I'm going to call the company and see what they can do. This crock pot is awful and I do not recommend it to anyone."
1,Do not buy this!!!,"My children bought this for me as a gift, it looked like a good idea with the hinged lid. Boy was I mistaken. The 1st or 2nd time I used it the hinge broke, then the latch broke, a little bit, piece by piece, by then the warranty was over. Today I used it and a handle has broken off. It almost seems as if it is melted. The screws are barely holding on. No replacement parts available, and getting the lid off without a handle or latch/hinge is nearly impossible without burning yourself. DON'T BUY IT!!!"
1,Lid Hinge Broke,"I bought the Rival Crock Pot SCVS600 at Target on April 29, 2007. I always had difficulty removing the lid from the hinge and had to resort to wiggling the lid back and forth and pulling it off with the locking mechanism. Recently my hinge broke off the lid. With no center knob on the lid, it is very difficult to control the lid. There are no replacement lids from Rival. The company offered me 25% off a new Crock Pot. No, thanks! I'll not be buying Rival products again soon."
2,"Don't waste money upgrading to a ""Hinged Lid""...worthless junk!","I use my Crock Pot all the time. The CrockPot is great, but the hinge broke off after less than one year of usage. I'm sure the special design cost me more than I would've paid for one with a regular lid. I went to CrockPot's web site to order a replacement and found that (though the part is only $10) by the time you pay the add'l $8.50 for shipping, to reorder the part is half the price of the crockpot itself! Moral of the story: Don't waste money on any special lids."
1,DO NOT BUY! This crockpot burns food!,This crockpot burns food and the lid does not work properly. I prepared two recipes from the cookbook that came with the crock pot. It burned both of them! More on one side and good thing I was home because I think it would have started a fire.
1,Please do not buy this,"This crockpot burns food and the lid does not work properly. I have been cooking with crockpots for over 30 years so have some experience with them. Food cooks at too high a heat, and swiss steak, which would have been moist and tender in another crockpot was burned in this one. The lid was terribly difficult to remove, and the screws on the henge broke. Now it is useless. This was a good price, but a terrible product. I am going back to the lid that I can just lift off with the knob on the top. This one is going in the trash."
1,Agree with other reviewer,"I also purchased this same model (from Walmart). Upon the first use, although the food cooked well and I enjoyed the hinged lid ""idea,"" the plastic open and close tab broke upon the first use. I also found the hinge difficult to operate. I didn't even wash this lid in the dishwasher (which the instructions said was fine to do) but it just snapped off at the screw attachment area on both sides. The price was great, but I would not recommend this product due to quality issues. So, I would conclude that this is not just a random issue, and would take serious consideration of this before purchasing."
1,Horrible construction,"The concept of the hinged top that locks is wonderful, but the execution is terrible. I have used this approx 4-5 times and the pin has been broken and replaced twice! Once the pin breaks, there is no way to open the lid safetly or easily, so it renders it unuseable - what a waste and what a disapointment. It doesn't matter what the price is - Crock Pot is supposed to be a quality name and this product does not work - back to the drawing board!"
1,Burns food--don't buy this one,"We received the smart pot version of this crock pot for Christmas. After trying to use it for several months, we threw it away. We've probably wasted $100 worth of meat in this crock pot. It always burns the food.We even used a meat thermometer on the low setting and found that it cooked the meat so quickly that the outside of a roast overcooked while the inside was still raw.In the past we have owned other crock pots that did not look as nice as this one, but worked much, much better."
3,"Pretty, but flawed","I've had this crockpot for several years now and have a few complaints.1. Yes, I've had it burn food too - but I will take a bit of blame for not having enough liquid, and cooking for too long.2. In my experience, you cannot successfully cook anything if the food raises into the decorative band area, which is higher than the external holder - meaning you loose about 2 quarts of usable cooking space.3. My lid does not really rest evenly enough to create an effective seal.4. The pot now has a hairline crack on the bottom which is all the way through the pot.In conclusion - if you want it because it's a really beautiful crock pot, and are willing to make sure you do not make it too full, or too empty - it will work - but I'm currently looking to replace mine."
1,Very unhappy,Crock Pot model SCVS600 is not a good investment. The lid gets super hot after a few hours of cooking and it is very hard to detach the lid from base. Only after a few uses the back plastic latch to lid broke cracked right off then on the next use the front plastic broke off lid. I was very disappointed in this product. I and trying to get it covered under warranty. I have contacted the company but it was after hours. It remains to be seen what kinda service they will provide.
4,Nice watch,"I dont have anything important about this watch, I like it and I buy it. its just a watch. no problems with it."
5,Casio 300-Page Databank 8-Digit Calculator,"I have been using one of the Casio Data Banks for about 20 years. Every 2 years I replace the battery. Every 4-5 years I buy a newer model. I still have 2 or 3 old ones that still run sitting in a drawer. I store all my phone #s and calendar appointments on it. I also use it to calculate medication doses, currency conversions, etc. The world time zone and stop watch and timer functions come in handy very frequently. It's not as quick or powerful as a PDA, it can't make telephone calls and it's not as simple to use as a pocket calendar, but it's with me all of the time."
4,Great Watch,"I got this watch to replace another style Databank watch that had issues.I like the features and ease of use. Although the display is slightly smaller than my last watch, for all your basic needs, it performs well.Anyway, for the price and the features included, it is a great value."
3,Poor case durability.,"I've just ordered by fourth Data bank - because of it's usfullness - Over 18 years the case&lettering failed. Lettering chipped and faded - case band ears broke off. I just returned an EDB610D I purchased in Jul 09 from the US Navy Exchange (Pearl Harbor - Hi). I ordered another Model DBC310-1 Data Bank in hopes it will last the rest of my life - (DOB 19Nov1929). I travel/ed a lot and relied on 90 - 130 tele numbers. Durability is not the strong suit of the watch case!. Earl Hollingsworth, 808-623-9834."
3,Five stars for functionality but one star for weak body,I have been buying these watches because you can enter appointments into the watch's memory using its keyboard rather than having to rely on a PC-based interface. The watch also has stopwatch and timer functions that I like. Other watches seem to lack this particular functionality. They rely on PC's to do the input which is inconvenient when you don't have a PC around.Five stars for functionaliy.Now to the problem. The body is weak. Typically the part where the pin holding the wrist strap is anchored to breaks off after about two years because the body is plastic. The gasket keeping the watch somewhat water-resistant distends. I wish they'd put this watch in a G-shock body.One star for robustnes.Overall 3 stars.
4,Good product - with two exceptions,"I have had three of these watches in the past few years. They function well, do what they'e supposed to do, and are very helpful. However, the printed alphabetic characters underneath each button will wear off in about 18 months, after which you haved to memorize which button corresponds to which alpahbet character. Not as hard as you might think, but irritating. Secondly, the watch case pin holes where the watch band pin attaches the band to the case will tend to erode or pull out over time. I've had to replace one perfectly good watch because I couldn't get a replacement band to attach."
5,i have worn casio watches for about 30 years,"had identical watch for years so very familiar with watch. i knew what i wanted as my old one is misplaced but in bad shape from my years of abuse. i love that my ""little black book"" is on my wrist. i even keep phone #'s for pizza hut, electric company ect. saves a lot of time and grief. has a timer that will go off only once or continually starts another cycle over and over untul shut off. i have it set to go off every year on my anniversary. i do not have to reset it, it goes off every year at the same time. this feature alone can be a life saver to forgetfull guys and more than the cost of the watch in expensive resturants if you forgot your anniverary!!! only watch i will and have worn for 30 years. i ordered this late aug 25, they shipped it on the 26th from new york, i had it in florida on the 27th!!! talk about blazing shipping!!! will definitely deal with again!!!"
4,"Simple, functional, elegant.","Casio kept true to form on this one. Everything works as we expect it to, and unlike my first databank watch, it has a light.The word ""light"" is rubbing out after having this thing a few years, and I've had to replace the resin band. Aside from that, I get great battery life by turning the little beep feature off, and sparingly using the alarm, and light.However, like all Casio digital watches, this one always seems to get ahead 30 seconds. So, you will want to reset the time every month or so. I reset mine 30 seconds behind because I think it levels off at some point.Data does not get lost when battery is changed. The calander display is nice because you know at a glance something is coming up this week, or the next.A pc-link, enhanced display, and better band would make this a definate 5 star product. A color oled display would rock.Let the world have their slips of paper, notebooks, and fancy schmancy PDA's. This has everything I actually need on it."
4,CASIO DBC310-1 DataBank Men's Watch,"I have been wearing a DBM-150 for the past 10 years and needed a new replacement Casio DataBank watch. I am disapointed in the DBC-310-1 because you can only input 8 characters per line, but you can input 16 characters, double the amount, in the DBM-150. I guess this is how Casio can say they have 300 pages but can only use half of the memory character wise. Also, there is no password secured data input on the DBC-310, but memory is on an EEPROM that is not erased when you change batteries. Otherwise, they are identical; however, the difference is significant. If I could do it over, I would order another DBM-150."
1,Casio Watch review,"This watch is not very accurate, on its manual it says +-15 a monthit is accualy +10 seconds a week to fast"
3,Nice but no snooze and has quiet alarm,"First, this is a great watch if you need to schedule alarms and do math. My short complaints are the fact that the alarm is too quiet and it has no snooze function. The other thing, of course, it looks geeky to have a calculator on your watch--some sort of cover or touch screen might hide it better. It really is a great piece of technology overall though."
4,great listening,i love him as his music is worth listening to . he understands what love actually is .
4,Beautiful,"One of the most unique voices. Someone beyond her years. Pastori has that leyendary voice many young artists wish they had. She makes these songs her own. An album for anyone who loves good music. Her voice is never forceful and she sings from the soul. She has that sweet mellow, honey like voice. Think of Norah Jones or Lizz wright. Voices that make you wanna sit down and drink a cup of tea, just relaxing. My favorites are ""Burbujas de amor"" and ""Cuando nadie me ve."" But I love the whole album. This is one of those albums that will capture many people. ""Who is that?"" is what most people will say."
5,A wicked book!,This book is awsome! It is fully colored and has exclusive pictures of the girls on tour and behind the scenes of some of there videos. It has a lot of information and a sign-up form to join the official fanclub. Everyone get out and buy it!
1,"Extremely unsatisfactory, need your help please!","Terrible product that broke within a few days of careful use. I would like to return the product but the Bachmann company will not return my voice message or my email. Can you help me please. Thank you! Sincerely, Jeremy Harper"
1,defective train,work fine when first recived it then it started making the rubber bands come off then it went to far the piston rods came off then while repairing it the srew fell in the carpet then was no sight off it all dont buy THIS!!!!
1,Weak,"Six years ago when Rollins was riding high, he used to say he would retire in a couple of years. Now his albums sell nothing and he plays to empty rooms he isn't saying he'll retire anymore. He sounds like a desperate man. And not desperate in the good sense that Bill Hicks sounded desperate on Rant in E-minor. Rollins just sounds very, very tired of it all.Henry, maybe it is time to do something else."
3,Keep this in mind...,"Yeah, this album is not his best. I'd say it's his weakest. BUT, when you consider that each and everyone of his many other spoken word albums are excellent I can't say it bothers me too much that this one isn't so. Especially when Rollins himself admits in the liner notes that he basically was asked to do this show as an experiment and he didn't have any new material. One would presume that's just not how Henry outputs his best. It appears he was right. But this album doesn't totally suck, it just sounds disjointed and haphazard and it's low on the gutsplitting humor one finds on previous albums. If you are new to Rollins do everyone a favor and get his Boxed Life album."
3,an off-night(s),"Rollins' spoken-word stuff is great, it really is, but this isn't his best work. Some of the material has already appeared on other cds, and the incisive/witty commentary doesn't really heat up until near the end of the cd. As Rollins himself explains in the liner notes, he didn't really have any new material at that point.For Rollins neophytes, I highly recommend Think Tank, Human Butt, Sweatbox, and The Boxed Life. Those cds are a better indicator of what Henry's capable of when inspired. On a side note, I saw him live about three weeks after buying this cd, and he was terrific, talking for over three hours (I definitely got my money's worth!) and he was hilarious! You can't write someone as funny and insightful as Rollins off on the basis of one weak cd, but you're better off trying his other work, especially the cds I listed above."
1,Not a belly dancing workout,"I've done belly dancing and belly dancing workouts but this is not it. I usually like Veena and Neena - they are both beautiful, talented and fun - but this is slow and dull. It can build arm and leg strength by having you hold your arms up a lot and do a lot of squat-like motions. If we aren't suppossed to be belly dancing while pregnant than they should have just not made a prenatal belly dancing workout. Instead they decided to make some money by pushing out another product."
1,Booooo-ring!,"I don't understand the reviews I read that led me to purchase this video. It's the most boring, non-challenging workout video I've ever encountered! Move your torso in a few circles, now point your toe out to the side, now point it to the other side...sheesh.This is simply coddling. Maybe useful in your 9th month if you can barely move."
4,Good workout,"I bought this after doing several of Veena/Neena vidoes(am still doing Basic Moves and Core Conditioning). I'm currently 5 months along and when I first watched the vidoe thought, oh wow, this is quite tame. Then I tried it-boy was it a workout! Not too difficult-but I loved how she had Kegels and squats-which are important for pregant moms. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a prenatal belly dance vidoe"
4,Good video,"This is a gentle, low-impact, yet thorough workout. I'm not currently pregnant, though I hope to be soon, and bought this in anticipation. You definitely feel like you've exercised with this program, but it does not make you overly tired nor is it strenuous. I think it is a perfect option for pregnancy, especially since they focus so much on rib cage exercises that help you have more room to breath around baby, and on stretching the pelvic/hip area in preparation for childbirth."
4,"Relaxing, but not too easy","I ordered this DVD in hopes finding a belly dance workout that's appropriate while pregnant, as I've enjoyed belly dance for exercise for many years. While it's really not ""dance"" (more like cardio and isolation moves based off some belly dance inspired movement), it's still a gentle, smooth, and wonderful workout. If you're careful to isolate your muscles and squeeze and release, you will feel a burn. My heart rate got up a little bit, but nothing crazy - which is perfect since I""m 6 months pregnant.While this workout won't make you sweat, it will stretch you and relieve tension and soreness in your muscles. I felt GREAT afterward! Tension and discomfort in my back and hips was relieved and I felt relaxed and renewed. If you want to get a more advanced workout, try some gentle aerobics or walking, but for a great exercise program that works your muscles and also stretches them out, give this one a try."
5,Great workout.,"I started this workout in my first trimester, and was surprised that such simple, non-jarring moves could make my thighs burn they way they did."
4,good for beginners,"I am in my 28th week and haven't exercised at all until just 2 weeks ago. I have Preggi Bellies (from Australia) and can only do the warmup. I can do 10 - 15 very slow minutes on an elliptical. This video will not work up a sweat, and it is a little boring. This is not learning to bellydance. That said, it is good for someone just getting back to exercise late in pregnancy or on a day that you are just really tired but still want to do something. Also, I've taken a couple of bellydance classes (pre-pregnancy) and it's a form of dance that makes me feel really good. Doing this video reminded me of these beautiful, graceful moves at a time when I feel anything but. I had 1 other Neena/Veena video years ago that I found unbearably annoying, this wasn't nearly as bad. And this is petty, but I wish she wore a different outfit, something a little more attractive (it's not the same outfit from the cover picture).I wouldn't have paid full price for it, but used it was well worth buying."
1,disappointed,"I have done other prenatal bellydance workouts and found ""belly baby"" to be unsatisfactory. The few movements that are done are not broken down and explained well. I didn't feel that they were providing a workout. The movements were rushed and not preformed long enough to provide benefit to the viewer. If you are looking for a prenatal video to help you stretch, increase stamina and understand bellydance and its' relation to childbirth look elsewhere."
4,Good DVD if you want to know about the history of capoeira,"It's as important to know about the history of capoeira as it is to learn all the moves and songs. This DVD is a good start to learning what capoeira was, what it is and what it might become, all told by two of the martial art's most respected mestres, Mestre Acordeon and Mestre Nestor Capoeira."
5,incredibly informative,"I found the first hand experiences of Both Mestre Acordeon and Nestor Capoeiria to be very informative and insightful, this dvd is a nice intro to the history and development of capoeira in more recent times."
4,Good thoughts on the game,It was nice to hear the perspectives of these two well-known mestres. I only wish that there could have been more jogos.
5,Very helpful book I can keep in my purse!,"After reading the big and bulky Maker's Diet, the shopper's guide was just what I needed as I eat at resturants and shop at the grocery store. This book is small enough to even fit in my purse!"
3,the Makers Diet,I think there must be another book to go with this one to explain some of the wording in The Makers Diet.One needed a little more encouragement from the book to follow up.I tried for so long to purchase this book and was a little disappointed to find very little of the authors thoughts and insights.
2,not so sure,while i agree with eating foods that are naturally grown i do not agree with the high cost mr. rubin charges for items that he states we need in our bodies.i wasted my money and time.
1,the makers diet :shoppers guide,"unless you live in a big city where you can find all this food, just as maybe chicago or new york city. i live in rural kentucky where theses item are not found. don't waste your money on this book."
2,If you own the Maker's Diet book don't waste your money,"I LOVED the Maker's Diet book and had high hopes for this one. However, it was almost a reiteration the section in the back of the Maker's Diet book with just a few additions. Not enough to justify buying the book. I am very disappointed that more effort wasn't put into this to make it different than the main book."
4,The Maker's Diet buying guide,"I ordered this book because I wanted an additional copy of a book I already have entitled The Maker's Diet by Jordan Rubin. I was initially very disappointed because it is not the complete book at all, just a shopping guide. I do find it useful; it includes some pruchasing guides and recipes not included in the original book, but I was disappointed. I should have read the smaller print on the book cover."
2,Book is not very helpful,"My review here is of the product itself. I already owned the original The Maker's Diet, and was looking for a supplemental book to flesh out the original appendixes more. This ""shopper's guide"" was described as offering shopping lists, recipes, tips, and menus to accompany the original book. It did contain all of these things, however they are exact same shopping lists, recipes, and tips that are contained in the original. The only difference I could find is that this book offers a full 40 days of menu planning. I might have just ripped the appendixes from the original book and carried them around with me. This book offered little new information to accompany the original The maker's Diet."
2,diet,"I did not like the diet because it was totally different from my normal daily routine. took a lot of time.The book was interesting to read, but not a diet for me"
4,Close to completely fragrance-free,"I do not tolerate the fragrances in other powders--to say the least, so I get this one for my mother. It isn't totally ok--but I am super sensitive and this one better than any other I have found."
2,wasn't good for me,i thought i'd try it but I guess I'm allergic. I got huge blisters on the bottom of my feet. Threw it away. ehh...you just never know.
3,Definitely worthwhile,"James Carroll is such a thoughtful writer that I wish I could give this book a higher rating, but it lacks punch when it comes to the criminal underworld aspect of the story. Carroll certainly knows Boston, especially Boston politics, and he knows the workings of the Cathlolic church inside out, and he captures the relationship between the Doyle brothers in a way that will be recognizable to any Irish American. But the criminal stuff is garden-variety crime fiction, written from a great distance. A pity. This is a good book that could have been a great one with a little more grit."
3,The City Below - Morality Play in Irish Boston,"Living in Massachusetts and working in Boston, this book had obvious appeal to me. I think the author takes the reader's knowledge of Boston to be that of a resident, so I think one would like this novel less if one did not know Boston. Another problem is related to the editing of the book. It seems as though the editor may have cut this book down too much. As a result, some characters are not well developed and the story seems to jump ahead too quickly. That said, this book is a real page turner. It combines history and fiction so well, you could easily imagine that the main characters (Nick and Terry Doyle) were indeed real. Furthermore, it contrasts the paths of these two brothers, and in a roundabout manner questions the morality of choices made by both. I would especially recommend this book to anyone that is familiar with Boston or its recent history."
4,The City Below,This book was recommended to me by a friend who like myself grew up in Charlestown. I grew up in Charlestown until 1981 when I was 25 and moved to Ct. I enjoyed reading about the place I called home and description of the streets on which I hung out. I do think he did well with the Doyle brothers but missed some of the real emotion and feeling of being a Townie. He also used incorrect names for some places/things while used exact names of others so I was unsure if it was for legal reasons he changed names or was he just misinformed. I agree with other reviewers that he did not get gritty enough with the criminal side of the characters. I have recommended this book to other Townies as an enjoyable look at our home.
4,A Epic Tale Like Gone with the Wind for our Generation,"A fascinating story of family, catholicism, and politics staged in the 60's 70's and 80's. Well worthwhile. My only criticism is I would have liked to know more about the characters. I was actually sorry to have the book end.Highly reccomened"
4,Good Band,I never heard of this band until the warped tour and they are actually really good. My favorite song on this cd is I Hear You Calling. This cd is a catchy one with good songs for singing. If you like pop punk then u will enjoy this cd a lot
5,too late no friends cd,this cd is in my opinion Gobs best cd. id really recommend it to anybody who likes some type of rock or punk music.
5,Good sound for low price,"I bought these to take to work, and I use them after hours to listen to my computer (streaming) or my ipod. I was surprised by the quality of sound I got for these applications."
1,Horrible sound,"There are much better 2.0 desktop speakers for similar or less money. The sound from these speakers is very dead, even when listening through the headphone jack. I'm returning these duds.Pros: extra input jackCons: dead sound. large case."
2,not so great,"I got these speakers for Christmas and at first I loved them. I use them with my laptop, and any speaker is going to be better than laptop speakers. However, after using them for a few months, I have started to notice that the sound quality out of the speakers isn't great, and for music with a lot of bass, I have to turn the volume way down to get decent sound quality. I'm trying to replace these speakers with something better...don't waste your money here"
4,Smooth Response,"For the money, these speakers are a great bargain for those looking for medium duty work/home office moderate volume listening. Very crisp mid-range and smooth highs. Great for Jazz, Blues or Pop. Don't expect much sub-bass frequencies, but I enjoy these Altec Lansings enough to have a set at work and at home."
2,"Inexspensive, yet still not a good value","I bought these speakers without hearing them because I just wanted basic sound for one of my computers. I had an older Altec Lansing satellite/subwoofer computer speaker system that was only slightly more expensive, so I expected these to sound reasonably good because the older ones sounded quite good for the price. Perhaps my expectations were unrealistic, but I was very disappointed when I hooked them up and started listening to some music. They are very dull and there seems to be some plastic resonance to the sound. Bass is nonexistent. Low midrange is about as low as these will go. Do not expect any ""punch"" whatsoever. News clips, fine, but music and even movies suffer."
3,not like the one I bought in the store,"This is my favorite pen due to it great grip and ink flow. Sadly, this pen is no longer made and the one from Amazon had a sticky substance on the grip. Hopefully it will wear off as there in no other place to buy these new now."
5,Wonderful fit,"Being left handed writing has always produced calluses on my fingers. This pen is form fitting, comfortable and no more knots on my hand. I now own 2 pens and a pencil by Sensa; and, pretty much only use them."
1,"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER! ""pics-place """,PRODUCT NEVER ARRIVED-SELLER NEVER RESPONDED TO MY EMAILS. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! pics-place HAS 100% NEGATIVE FEEDBACK OVER THE LAST 30 DAYS.
5,Get this One!,"This 2006 Dale Watson release is, in my opinion, his best work yet. While Nashville and ""modern suburban Country Music"" continues to pollute the airwaves, Dale Watson never fails to put out quality music. This album has to rank among the finest of this decade. There are 14 songs here, and not a bad one in the bunch. Dale has one of the most distinct voices in country music, with a lot of Merle Haggard style. But his vocals on this one, harken back to the great Lefty (who Merle also imitated), while still maintaining that ""no-nonsense"" delivery of Dale's. I also have to say that the guitar work is fantastic....very similar and hard charging as that of the Johnny Horton sound or even Marty Stuart! A few standout tracks, including ""38:21:34"" and the title track ""Whiskey or God"". The sound and mixing are flawless. Overall, no complaints. I'm already looking for his next release. A+"
2,defect turnouts,"i have got this set to extend my set. i have waited a long time for the shipment, so i was very excited about it. much to my surprise, two of the turnouts were defect; the trains were constantly derailing. i had to buy new turnout from the local hobby shop. i advise buying the parts separately: somehow the parts from this kit are low quality."
4,Great value,"If you plan on using the Bachmann EZ track system, this pack is a great value. It is well packaged and can even be used for storage for extra track. In addition, it comes with the terminal and switch extension cables which are a must for a larger layout. I have not had the problems with the switches that some others have commented on but I know others that have. This is just something you have to recognize as a limitation of the EZ track."
3,Disambiguous,"A worthy expose, for its time, perhaps. But, it's still interesting as an historical document, I think. With better editing, and additional information, it may still provide insight into the 'game', so to speak."
4,The classic spiritual allegory,"Bunyan's rich description of Christian's journey to the Celestial City is replete with powerful spiritual lessons at every turn. The book paints a thorough picture of Bunyan's view of Christ and what it means to follow Him completely. Whether it is the characters Christian meets along the way, the dangers that befall him or the reflections of the dreamer, Bunyan uses every facet of this book to challenge his readers to deeper, more authentic discipleship. While admittedly somewhat clumsy to read stylistically, this book deserves a prestigious place among the spiritual classics. Highly recommended."
2,Did not deliver what I ordered and did not send replacement,"They sent the wrong book, which was to be a gift for Christmas, but refused to send a replacement...I had to go to Books a Million. So much for ordering online..."
3,Worth a Try,"I bought these after reading a review that said they were really great and that this was their best entree. I expected better. They are ok for something different, fast, and easy. I probably won't buy more but I will finish eating what I ordered."
3,Mediocre comfort food,"I got home today from a long day of work and was trying to figure out what to make for dinner, when I noticed a box from amazon. It was the tasty bite meals, and I figured I'd give it a try.I have to say, it hit the spot. Not because it was delicious, in fact, it actually didn't taste like much of anything (rather bland). But it was warm, tasted fresh, and LOOKED really good. (It looks better than it tastes).So while I wouldn't cook it for company, it was a fairly healthy meal (9 WW points) and beat a microwave dinner."
1,Terrible!,"This tastes more like a chemist's concoction than Peas Paneer. If this is somebody's first acquaintance with Indian cuisine, they would avoid Indian cuisine for the rest of their life."
3,Set up is difficult,"I bought the Vetta because I had purchased one 15 years ago and it lasted this long and I was very happy with it. This one had everything I was looking for including cadence. However, I ignored some of the warnings of the difficulty in installing it. First, it comes with wires that will ONLY accommodate a front wheel installation. So, if you plan on using your bike on a trainer, you are out of luck. I found extension cables that allowed me to install the sensors on my rear wheel...however, when that arrived it didn't work. So, I ended up sending everything back."
3,Eh... nothing new...,"Sheree Bykofsky is more or less the reason I picked this book up. Anyone who has suffered the task of wading through references for non-fiction publishers will recognize her name. I myself have received several polite form-letter rejections from her. With this in mind, I naively thought there might be some fresh tips. In the end, it was a bit of a disappointment. If you're new to marketing your work you won't go far wrong picking this guide up. It provided the same ole uniform ideas for query lay-out in accesible form, but without the usual massive list of publishers, agents, etc. Its a brilliant guide for someone interested solely in fantasizing about publication. Its likely the most optimistic book written on the subject."
5,It works,"About a year ago, I wanted to write a book. I knew alot about a certain subject, and I've published a few articles in various trade magazines, but I had no idea what it took to write a book, approach a publisher, get it done, and so forth. I didn't know anything about the publishing industry at all. I went to my local book store and found a copy of The Complete Idiot's Guide To Getting Published, read it, and in a WEEK I had a book contract. Now, my own book... has been published.... The book had every bit of information I needed to get this done. How to write a proposal, how to do negotiate the contract ..., and the things I could expect in the writing process. Excellent book, and a must-have one-stop-shop for any aspiring authors."
5,This book is a perfect example of its own helpful message,"There is something almost humorous about how well this book finally achieves what so many before it have attempted--a simple, straight forward, readable, succinct and enjoyable reality guide to traveling the highway from idea to well-marketed book.Not only does it corral all the key points to be made about every step of the process, it makes it clear how to do them, and in the process it serves as its own best example of how to write and put together a how to book.This is a book for even the very smart and experienced to use as a check list, as well as being a most reassuring and helpful guide for the complete ingenue. It is also a very enjoyable read."
5,OUTSTANDING,"Following is an e-mail I sent to the author. It speaks for itself. ""I'm writing a novel and my wife gave your book (Idiot's Guide ...) to me as a Christmas gift. It is really outstanding. I thank you for sharing such a wealth of knowledge with the rest of us. It gives those of us, the uninitiated, a level of sophistication when approaching the market that we would not ordinarily have. All the best Nick Battista"""
5,Yes. Please. A CD. Even a tape of this soundtrack.,"The Robert Altman movie, 'Popeye' is perfect in every aspect. The music, lyrics and soundtrack by Harry Nilsson and Van Dyke Parks is brilliant.Robert Altman did a fabulous job. The casting is also brilliant. I hope the set, which I now know exists as a tourist attraction in Malta, (I may have to go there), won every award possible. If it did not, someone surely did miss the boat. Everyone connected with the movie should be extremely proud."
5,A smart and sexy Collection,"The ten short stories that make up this collection have been chosen very well; every one of them is pacy, funny, and as hot as you'll find anywhere. What made it work for me was the wit and invention all the writers brought to the book's theme - the skulduggery and sexual powerplay of politics.Out of ten stories I expected to find at least a couple of duff ones, but by the end I suspected the editors had more trouble leaving stories out than finding ones to put in. This is a high-class collection and a hoot to read - strongly recommended!"
2,Disappointing.,"I was hoping to find a video that might provide an interesting exerpt or two for my high school world history class, but this doesn't do it. The presentation is disjointed with the camera work and commentary sometimes out of sync , creating confusion. For clarity, I believe we ought to be allowed to look at the art work while the commentator is discussing certain features. I can remember several places where the commentator drew my attention to something in a painting while the camera had gone on to picture something else. You really have to already know quite a bit about the artists and the city to be able to follow this."
4,A VERY GOOD OPTION FOR NOT PRO MECHANICS,"iS A VERY GOOD GUIDE TO DETECT TROUBLES IN THE OPERATION OF YOUR HD MACHINE, AND KEEP IT IN GOOD CONDITIONS.I THINK THAT THE MANUAL NEEDS MORE GRAPHICS LIKE OTHERS HAYNES MANUALS.ANY WAY GOOD BOOK"
5,Ombra Citrus Sage Foam Bath,"If you love quality bath products, and love the smell of real-life citrus with a lovely light hint of sage, (not some phoney made up pretend citrus scent), you will LOVE!! this bubble bath! Ombra is known world wide as a high end bath product manufacturer, and this is my favorite scent of their foam bath products. The bath bubbles are lovely, the ingredients non-irritating - I have very sensitive skin -just an irreplaceable foam bath - my favorite all time."
5,Clear it out and wake up!,"I love this stuff! This specific one is better than the other brands around. I'm a night worker and use this to clear out my sinuses and wake myself up a bit when my eyelids get super heavy. Works like a charm on both counts. A coworker could only find a different brand and she said it was a let-down. Then she got this stuff and is as happy as I am. I might look a little weird sticking this in my nose and taking a big sniff, but boy is it worth it. It's like a cough drop for your nose. Yippee!"
5,Fantastic!,Amazing product! Clears up a suffy nose in seconds. A much better natural alternative than those nose sprays. Lasts a long time too.
4,Crazy In Love,"Out of all the songs that have really been surprising, there have been very few that actually have shown the feel of it not just in the song, but the video as well. Gnarls Barkley is one of those few that have surprised us all with Crazy. The song is very, very catchy, where its video showcases the view of a infinte inkblot test. I was really amazed with how the song delivers. I just hope that Gnarls Barkley can continue to make other good songs like this one, soon. I just haven't gotten tired of hearing this one yet.Song: B"
1,Crazy - Gnarls Barkley,It's my own fault but beware there are only two songs on this disc. I feel like I got ripped off.
5,Good Songs,I enjoyed the CD and would purchase from this seller again. It was shipped in perfect condition and on time.
3,GBCD,"I feel like I was led to believe that this was an entire cd from Gnarls Barcley, I didn't realize it was a single. Clearly I love it but was disappointed."
1,CRAZY,VERY DISAPPOINTED AS THERE WAS ONLY THE ONE SONG ON THE CD. I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THE CD WOULD CONTAIN BARKLEY'S ENTIRE ALBUMN.
4,It's Refreshing,"I can't remember the last time I heard such a soulful modern day song. It's probably been years since I did. ""Crazy"" stirs up my emotions, which is what a good soul song is supposed to do. The vocals are on point and I love the violin sounds, but the rest of the music could've been a *little* better."
4,A triumph of creativity over censorship,"During most of his creative life, Barkley was under surveillance. The unevenness of his art and its limitations are a reflection of his limitations under Stalin. Since Barkley was not a follower of serialism, he could afford to translate into the string quartet medium most of his tortured inner self.This piece is filled with humanism. It is not easy listening in the sense of Hadyn and Mozart. It is rather a deep, touching piece like the late Beethoven, Schumann or Bartok.I admit he is too much of a diva, but you can't deny his wonderful singing. He is the 3rd best selling female of all time (only Madonna and Nana Mouskori have sold more) and here he is in all his glory."
1,Old and stale,Ak Mak is one of healthiest and tasty crackers available. It does not have a long shelf life. When it goes over the hill and becomes stale it taste terrible. Amazon just shipped us a whole case of stale old Ak Mak Crackers. Very disapointing.
4,Pretty Standard Vocal Score,It's a pretty standard vocal score. It does give a short synopsis of the story in the beginning. The binding is sturdy and the pages are well laid out and easy to read. I don't know French so I can't comment on the accuracy of the English translation. Good vocal score and widely used.
4,A good idea book but...,"This book has some really interesting (and complex) examples of various rooms decorated with stencils. It also comes with some of the stencil patterns at the end of the book. But as a beginner, I find some basic information missing (and had to get another book as a result). This book assumes that one understands the basics of painting and stencilling.It does not explain, for example, what kind of paint does one use on walls vs on furniture. Despite the beautiful pillow on the cover, the book does NOT cover stencilling on fabric at all. And if one does not want to take on an elaborate project to cover all the walls of a room, there is no example on simple projects (such as adding just a border). If you are artistic, experienced with painting and stencilling and can visualize the results, this book is good."
5,great movie,Since I have loved watching this movie on my Hallmark channel I decided to purchase it to watch whenever I choose. One of my favorites. . .
5,first time watcher,I just watched the movie for the first time this St. Patrick's day weekend on Hallmark!! I DVR'd it and have watched it several times since. This is a very good movie and a darling love story. I think her assistant Jeffrey (Brandon Firla) is just precious and so is Connor Bailey the gentleman she meets in New Kerry! :) If you are Irish (acutally I am not) you will just love this movie. I would definitely recommend this movie. Plan on purchasing a copy of my own soon.
5,Daniel's daughter,"is a lovely romantic story about forgiveness, and finding the person you were meant to be, with the person with whom you were meant to be."
4,Above average...though predictable.,"At first, I wasn't sure if I'd like this DVD when my wife brought it home from the library, but I was pleasantly surprised. Not by the predictable storyline, but by the fine acting of all the characters in it...including the dog. It was a warm, fuzzy, chick-flick, to be sure, and I was wondering why Sandra Bullock wasn't cast in the part of the ""All Work/No Play"" magazine editor Katherine instead of Laura Leighton. It seemed more like a Bullock vehicle. But that's just my opinion and I'm probably in the minority.""Daniel's Daughter"" was a very romantic movie set in New Kerry, MA, where just about all of the locals are Irish-American and a few still speak with a brogue. You'd think Massachusetts was a suburb of Dublin the way Hollywood envisions it in just about every movie I've ever seen that was flimed there. Fortunately, H'wood managed to not ruin a nice love story.Both my wife and I highly recommend this enjoyable movie."
2,Daniel's Daughter,"Honestly, I thought this movie was going to be better. It was just mediocure. Nothing special."
1,Very unhappy and unsatisfied,I had to contact the seller to find out where this item was and only then did I find out that they would have to refund for the purchase. If I hadn't made the effort would I ever have gotten my money back? I don't know.
5,Absolutely Beautiful!,"I was so lucky to come across this book in the library. A sparkling gem amoung the dusty tomes! I savored every page, every image that May conveyed through her delicate, honest words. A beautiful book for anyone who seeks to know how a simple life can be so full. Highly recommended!"
4,Wonderful!,"A journal of three years she lived alone by the sea in Maine in order to find her creativity and to come to the center of things. She has many beautiful insights on aging, writing, death, light, poetry, animals, gardening, food, friends. It's wonderful."
2,Not Ring Bound As Told in Description,"Has great information, however, I very specifically wanted a 3 ring bound book, with tabs and pockets for contracts so it would help me be organized - and this was not! It said it was in the description, but instead the book is spiral bound with no tabs nor pockets. Good content, but definitely no help with organizing the wedding and the information you will receive."
4,What do you appreciate?,"I once had ""Antonin Dvorak New World Symphony"" (catalog MH-2-8411) from the people at Classical Treasures, but needed another copy and could not find an exact copy of that release...The sound quality is nothing special here, but this disc contains the best performance of the Slovinic Dance in C major op. 46 No. 1 that I've heard. Newer versions with superior sound quality are much slower in tempo. It's quite sad. The music itself is all good here and serves as a good reminder that sometimes the older recordings are worth looking into.I gave this a four star rating for the mediocre sound quality and for the ""Scherzo"" in the New World Symphony no longer being on the album."
2,Very dull and boring,"There are not too many Irish Karaoke DVDs out there so I was very keen to get this one and listen to it. I see that one person had reviewed it previously and rated it 5 stars. I should have looked at the reveiw and the person doing the review a little more closer. It was from a karaoke superstore that rates all it's review as 5 star, and the review itself gave little more than a track listing.Anyway, I found most tracks to be very dull and boring. There was just no life in the tracks. I have been singing along to Irish tunes for many years and was wanting a Karaoke DVD for my wife to listen to and learn. She had previously shown an interest in doing this, but after listening to this I think she has been put off for life.The only thing this DVD may help is for her to get a gist of the songs and learn the words. Hopefully in time for next St Pats day.Also, nothing against America, but I found the music to be almost Americanised, lossing very much of the traditional Irish sound."
3,If you like Roy Rogers,"If you like Roy Rogers, it may be a good idea to nuy this Black & White movie on DVD. Obviously, this movie is old, the voice is no more perfect and the transfert of the movie on a DVD will not restaure it but it shows a kind of movie that Hollywood has made between 1930 and 1950."
3,Perfect for Headlights,I would have given this a 5 star rating but the price is a little high. Other than that it's fine.
1,NOT AS ADVVERTISED,"THIS PRODUCT SHOWS A MOUNTING TAB ON IT, BUT THE ONE I RECEIVED HAS NO TAB. SO HOW DO I MOUNT IT?"
3,it's ok,I was looking for a course in English Grammar: I wans Wrong this is not.but the price was cheap the is' way I dint' send it' Backthis is ok for people the just got here.in the USA and want to lear English.also I dont' like the British accentis Good for some one who live in England and wnat to lear the way they speeck English there.
2,Not the greatest,This is not one of the best Bond books. I found that is was quite boring and lacked suspense.I was very disappointed.
4,A wonderful and rich album,"Mary Beth's ""Supernatural"" release is a great album. Songs such as ""Hold On"" and ""All I want is you"" make this an album to listen to time and time again. The melodies and verse are hypnotic. She is a true talent that warrants a listen. I highly recommend this album!!"
5,Excellent watch,"I have had this watch for a year now and it is still my favorite everyday watch. It goes under water and gets wet every day. Other than a battery replacement I have not had a minutes trouble with it. Very well made and the quality is evident. I would recommend this watch to anyone who wants a watch that looks great, takes punishment and will last forever."
4,Great watch with a very good price!,"I just bought this watch. It is really a good watch,what's important,the price is so good. I highly recommend this watch."
4,Casio Databank Watch,"Good product, just a little different from image product, but still a great watch for the price.."
4,Casio World Time Data Bank watch,"Looks great. Feels great. Only two aspects stand out for me as a bit negative:1. The dial light is gold and it's difficult to see the hands at night when using the light in a very dark environment - back lighting would be better.2. The digital time displays on two lines with the seconds above the hours:minutes display. This took some getting used to. Same thing in the stopwatch mode. Once I was used to it, it works OK. However, it's not a natural way to read digital time.Love the metal case and styling. Not expensive (I paid $24.95 US). Great value!"
4,Super pop,"This song will be an anthem to cover a couple of years. I wouldn't be surprised if it ended up being the theme song for quite a few senior proms and dances. It sticks in your head and will eventually drive you mad. Mixes very very well with ""Celebration"" by Kool & the Gang and ""Celebrate"" by 3 Dog Night. The deeply layered horn loops that make up the main texture and the simple synths that underlay the quiet section are pure Daft Punk. Make something extremely complex sound very simple. As a single goes, however, this one desperately needs more mixes. I'd say skip the single and buy the album when it comes out."
2,Too Bad,"Fred Solinger wrote : in many ways, ""one more time"" is what one would imagine the never-recorded stardust album would sound like.Fred I think it's a big mistake.Vik wrote : Don't buy this pop.Vik you are 200 % right.I mean I was expecting from Daft Punk very strong and cool album, instead of that I recieved something like electronic Cher. Funny, but when my girlfriend went trough the door I was listening to ""one more time"" and she asked me : look, what's wrong with you, are you listnening to Cher or what?The only thing I can say is that I am too disapointed, coz this album is too comercial and it sounds too pop, if you like quality sound of electronic music, don't purchase this CD."
2,Dissapointed !,"Dissapointment of the year for me, no doubt. I was expecting big things of this but it is way too cheesy and offers nothing new (like their earlier works did). Stardust was much better than this. I also don't understand why they felt the need to ruin Romanthony's voice as he's a great singer. You should rather check out the new Demon single if you can 'You are my high'. Now that is a quality tune, wish the new Daft punk sounded like that."
2,Umm..is there another artist named Daft Punk?,"The drums, vocals, and synths sound nothing like Daft Punk. If you enjoyed the classic album ""Homework"", then do not buy this. The first thing that came to mind was ""Eiffel 65"". It's super cheesy Hit Radio crap. Its ok. The boys had a miscue. It happens to everyone. I just hope this doesn't happen again, because I though Homework was the best House album ever. Oh well, last advice: Don't buy this pop."
5,Endless joy! Great book!,"This book contains ALL LYRICS AND TUNES of Robert Burns, as well as the background,history and annotation of every song. To sing these songs is endless joy! A must have for every folk song fan, and for everyone who want to know what the serious study of folk musicology is."
5,A Great Collection of Stories,I own a large library of surf books and have become a fan of the ones that I slow down to savor. This is one of those. Warsaw chose excellent stories in this collection; the variety is wonderful as is the changing pace of the reads and the subject matter varies nicely. This is one of my favorites.
4,"A great collection, but missing one essential work, imo.","I bought this book used in good condition, and it's great. The condition looks like it was read at the beach, which of course suits me fine. The book excerpts and articles contained within are doing for me exactly what I'd hoped- turning me on to read the full pieces, and exposing me to writers I may not have discovered on my own. My only peave is that it doesn't include any reference to or excerpt from the novel Breath, by Tim WintonBreath: A Novel, which I think is a seminal piece of surf fiction and and fun read to boot. Other than that glaring omission, I am thoroughly enjoying my $3.98 plus shipping purchase! :)"
3,"nicely photographed, inspiring story; some flaws also","This is beautifully photographed in Goshen, Indiana, and the story is compelling enough and certainly original. You just have to stick with it for a while as it starts off very slowly and doesn't ever pick up a lot of speed. Then again, it's not an action movie. The acting is tolerable, with two adult sisters diverging on how to remember their murdered mother and deal with the tragic farm accident that befalls the daughter of one of them.Some flaws: A lot of the dialogue is repetitive. Also, spoilers ahead.......The ending disappoints me as writer. I would not have tossed my hard work away like that. The character could have used a pseudonym and published it as fiction in order to spare others' feelings instead of just chucking it all wastefully."
2,Pearl Diver,"I was disappointed. From what the jacket said about it, the story was not what I expected. What else can I say, it was a waste of time for me."
2,"Somewhat engrossing, cliched family feature...","First time effort from Sidney King. I had never even heard of this film until earlier this week, so I decided to give it a try.The story is engaging, but veers into cliched territory on more than one occasion. The acting leaves much to be desired, but is not unwatchable. Shot on a very low budget, and looks that way. This film may have been edited with a chainsaw...If you have an hour and a half to spare, and aren't in the mood for anything challenging, you couldn't do much worse than PEARL DIVER."
3,Indian Entree Makes a So-So Meal,"After trying & loving every Tasty Bite I ever put in my mouth, I ordered the 6 box deal sight unseen of this flavored entree. It is not up to par or AS good as the other offerings from Tasty Bite. The flavor is a bit subdued & the packet is a bit soupy with more liquid than veggies which is disappointing. I like the corn so I added some of my own at home & poured some of the extra liquid on a grilled chicken breast, which was a good solution. I plan to stick with other entrees from Tasty Bite but won't reorder this one. It is too soupy & bland for my taste. I'm spoiled to the other Tasty Bite offerings which are wonderful. (Bombay potatoes, anyone?)"
2,"Agree with others, this is so-so & probably won't buy again","It's a nice time-saver for a meal, but watery sauce without alot of flavor and not alot of gusto."
3,Thai Curry?,"Its not terrible, but dont expect this to taste like any thai curry you've had in a thai restaurant. It makes a nice little meal... its very easy to make. But for about $3.50 a pop, I think i'd rather just double my money and spend $7 for a lunch special at a local thai restaurant. The flavor just isnt there."
3,"It's pretty good, you could find better.","When I first tried it after heating it, I was very disappointed. By the time I was done it had grown on me though. The veggies are pretty good, and the sauce could use some more spices, but otherwise it's pretty good. As for authenticity, it's definitely better than some of the others out there. It comes in a nice plastic microwavable lunchbox. They're pretty durable and convenient, so I've been washing them out and saving them. It also comes with a plastic spoon. Overall, I only give it a 3, because my one complaint is that the rice it comes with is kind of gross. If you're used to fresh, steamed white rice, the processed, clumped together rice that comes with this will make you go ""what?"" However, if you have a rice cooker like I do, in 20 minutes you can have a pretty painless and tasty meal. I live in the dorms, and this is one of the better 2am craving foods to keep around."
3,Too much packaging and too little food!,"Seems like twice as much packaging with tons of hard plastic! A nightmare for the landfill! food is good, a bit on the spicy side. don't expect enough for a meal -- just a snack."
4,Interesting Documentary,"The Devil's Mass is a 1970 American documentary film about Anton LaVey and the Church of Satan, I found it really interesting and worth watching/ owning if the subject interests you. Sinthia the Devils Doll on the other hand is a psychedelic incoherent nonstop dream sequence mess of a movie, that is only even 1/2 tolerable and watchable because it has a good deal of skin."
4,Interesting for sure!,I have been studying The Church of Satan and decided that I wanted an inside look at Anton LaVey and company. It's actually quite entertaining but some of the parts are a little strange. Not something I would show at a family get together or anything. Worth the price and offered some good interviews with LaVey and members of the church.
5,Amazing series!,"Full Metal Alchemist is one of those amazing animes that make you feel every emotion. You'll feel anger, happiness, disbelief and you'll end up laughing your head off (usually when Edward is being called short). I love this anime series and it's easily on the top ten list of my favorite animes of all time. This show is definitely worth buying!"
1,great deal but messed up,I will not be buying from this person again. they said the item was in near new condition they failed to mention the parts of the casing that were nearly entirely scratched off. this seller is untrustworthy I would not suggest a buy.
3,CHeper at other sites,The Reason why i shop here at amazon. is that i can get it quicky and. it is usaully the cheapest on the market. but i have found that i can get each box set from $25.00 to 31.00 dollars at most other sights.
5,Soccoer in your backyard,"""Soccer in your backyard"" is a good book if you don't know how to play. I learned alot of tricks and moves from the book and Daniel. He's also my coach. He's funny, nice, and a great soccer player. Don't use your money buying other books, buy a book called ""Soccer in your backyard"" By:Daniel Dos Santos"
4,I go to his soccer camp and clinic,"Hi I'am Paul Rujimora from Our Lady of the Lakes school,6th grade,I go to Daniel's soccer camp.He's a good teacher.Daniel is fun to be with, he always finds a way to have fun at camp.So think you should get his Soccer in your back yard."
3,Fun with Joe and Mac,This game is actually a little challenging...I've found that the game has to be played almost flawlessly so that you have as many lives as possible when you reach the final boss to work with.
5,AN INSTANT CLASSIC!,"This was one of the most nastalgic games from my childhood! I mean, what could be better than going around prehistoric times with a friend, and bashing every enemy you come across. The game is full of fun enemies, cool but challenging boss fights, and awesome power-ups. The game gives you and your friends lots of continues so you can still make a decent number of mistakes before you get a game over. That being said, there is no save feature, so make those continues count! My only main complaint about this game is that if you move to fast and your partner falls off the screen they die. What's up with that? How about just make me character unable to move forward instead of killing my friend? Is that too much to ask for? At any rate, this game is lots of fun, especially with a friend, and is still pretty good even when going solo! This is a great game to add to your collection!"
3,Which 'Charade' should you buy?,"I've struck out twice now in buying Charade. Both purchases were grainy and hardly what I would consider ""restored"". This particular edition is just okay, it is an upgrade from earlier copies but not exceptional by today's standard of visual clarity.To second Sanpete's earlier suggestions, if you can afford it definitely buy the anamorphic Criterion Collection release, and if you're looking for high quality without the high price, go for the double-billed The Truth About Charlie dvd which includes Charade. Just make a note to never actually watching The Truth About Charlie.To summarize, this particular copy of Charade is mediocre in quality, albeit the deceptively stellar cover-art."
2,"NOT ""remastered"" - plus cheap packaging","I paid double the cost of other versions to get what I thought would be an exceptional copy of this film. It isn't even decent, and I cannot believe Amazon even offers it!The cheap case art and unprofessional layout gives you the first clue. Watch the DVD and immediately you can see that you could have seen better quality on network TV. Apparently the ""remastering"", if any, occurred by pointing a video camera at someone's basement wall.I'm returning it."
1,Very poor picture and sound quality,"I loved this film when it was first released in theaters and have seen it televised with commercials, but I was nostalgic about seeing it without them. The movie is excellent, but the quality of this dvd was VERY poor. The actors' lips and the soundtrack were out of sync much of the time. The picture quality seemed to come and go - sometimes fairly clear, but sometimes fuzzy. The dvd skipped or jumped in some places. All in all, a very poor and irritating viewing experience. I returned the dvd for a refund."
3,Wonderful Movie - Terrible DVD quality,"I love this movie and was excited to finally upgrade from the old VHS I have sitting in a box that I hadn't watched for years. Imagine my disappointment the first time I watched this DVD to discover that the quality is far INFERIOR to that of my old VHS! There are multiple skips and breaks so that classic lines are lost, grainy images, and lines running through the image. I ought to have read other reviewers before purchasing, and hopefully others will do so and save money and the mistake I made. I'm going to have to buy this again from a more reputable DVD manufacturer. Hrmph."
1,Great movie - Poor quality DVD,"""Digitally Remastered"" version. Very poor quality video and audio. Felt as if I was watching in on a 20 year-old VHS tape. Likely going to return it."
5,Correction,"Accidently, I have rated a 3 but in reality they are a Good 5! thank you for the good service!"
4,Patio furniture,"The set was easy to assemble and looks very nice on my tiny patio. It is good for tight spaces. The price was good considering I didn't have to go shopping, load the set, and got this with free shipping (Amazon Prime)."
2,Not as good as I thought it would be.,"Not as good as I thought it would be, it was expensive but had none of the options that I thought were advertized."
2,"Watch OK, Watch Band Terrible","I only kept the watch for a couple of days and then returned it. The problem was with the band. It pulled the hair on my wrist. The watch looks nice, but it was painful to wear."
1,HUGE strap and numbers fell off,"The strap that comes on this watch is HUGE. I bought it for my husband, and took all of the adjustment links out and it was still too big. And the metal piece which joins the strap was sitting on his bone. Not comfortable. After a month or so, number 9 fell off and got stuck under the second hand. The watch was completely useless after that as it jammed up the whole mechanism. So unfortunate as this watch is sooooo beautiful. Amazon handled a very prompt refund, so 5 stars for Amazon customer service!"
5,Very nice,"Exceeded my expectations. Beautiful watch for not alot of money. Band will probably need adjusting, unless you are a behemoth. YouTube can show you how to remove the links, or you can take it to a jeweler. Great watch."
4,Review of Casio Men's EF106SG-2AV Edifice 10 Year Battery Analog Bracelet Watch,"Stylish, appears to be well made. The bracelet is too large for most wrists,and one or more links will need to be removed. My onl;y complaint is the watch is fairly thick compared to others, and the calandar dates are small."
2,Very uncomfortable band,This was a Father's Day gift for my husband. He loves the look of the watch. One major prombem with it is the band. The edges are sharp and very uncomfortable. It digs into his wrist and has made this everyday watch a watch that will not get worn a lot. I think we will have to get a new band for it which then makes it not such a great deal. I also bought a women's Casio watch with the same type of band and have the same problem.
5,Amazing watch,This is an excellent Gold& silver colored watch. Its totally amazing. It says battery life is 10 years.
4,"Great watch, band needs instructions","This is a great watch for the money and it comes with an attractive two-tone stainless steel clasp style band. Unfortunately, it comes without any instructions for adjusting the band so you're left with two choices: 1) Take it to a jeweler or watch repair shop and pay someone to do it for you or 2) Look for instuctions on the internet and hope you have the necessary jeweler's screwdriver to make the adjustment.After some searching I was able to find some instructions for removing links from a Casio band that came somewhat close to this model. I had the correct tools on hand and after about 20 minutes of attempts I was able to make the proper adjustment. Why Casio doesn't tell you how to do this is beyond me.That said, the watch is sharp-looking, it's keeping perfect time and it's a great value for the money."
5,Nice watch,"This watch is really elegant. Considering the price and the quality, I cannot mention any drawback. It's worth buying."
4,Like it.,Looks good quality and style for the price. Removing links turns out not as difficult as what I have heard before the purchase. You do need a jewelers flat-head screwdriver though. See the photos that I have uploaded.
4,nice looking timepiece,"great looking watch, feels great, easy to read, hope the 10 year battery holds out. would have gave it five stars but will have to wear it awhile"
5,Tal y como lo ves---muy atractivo!,"Un reloj para hombre muy bonito gran precio, buen producto recomendado, mi novio lo compró para regalo y ahora le gustaría uno para él. Recomendado"
2,Alice in Wonderland: A Dance Fantasy,"Alice in Wonderland: A Dance Fantasy is a bad example of how books can be turned into great films. This not-even half hour ballet is utterly disturbing and vile in its nature. I liked the style, but the plot that the Alice stories are famous for is absent and the memorable characters we once knew have been replaced with boring or just stupid characters who we just want out of our faces. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it reminds me of a school play, and I love those. I guess I was just expecting a ""bit"" more than this. It might have been better if I hadn't have been comparing it to other Alice films, but I still think it is strange."
1,Don't go there,"Now trust me, I love the sound of Clarence Carter, Clarence Carter, Clarence Carter, Clarence Carter. However, the tunes on here are not representative of a true ""Greatest Hits"" package on this artist. Don't be fooled by the title. The majority of the ""Hits"" on here are covers; he even covers his own, but I have to confess, he doesn't do any of them particularly well. This could very well be an imposter pretending to be Clarence Carter, Clarence Carter, Clarence Carter, Clarence Carter. You'll be slammin' if you buy this disc. I just hope you don't cut your hand when it breaks."
2,NOT LONG ENOUGH!,"THIS IS ONLY A 20 MINUTE CD!!!...I CAN'T REALLY USE THIS. I DO MASSAGE THERAPY. IT DOES NOT SAY ON THE PRODUCT INFO ABOUT THE LENGTH OF THE CD. MOST CD'S ARE LONGER, LIKE 60 MINUTES. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OK IF IT WAS AT LEAST 30 MINUTES."
4,Worth buying album,"After searching ard to source for the most pleasant-listening Vivaldi 4 seasons, this is one of those that can really make one lay back and relax the entire music. The articulation of each single musical instruments is beautifully defined. Dynamics are just right for the pieces."
2,Dated and Not in a Good Way,"I enjoyed it somwhat as a light holiday read, but it is dated now. Also, it was too much a fictionalization of Bill Clinton to stand alone. Not one of her books that I recommend."
2,A Brit's take on American history in the 90s...,"The heart of this novel had the potential to give readers a great story and several hours of entertainment. Unfortunately, the execution of the plot became far too ""Clinton-esque"" to remain enjoyable for the long haul. For me, all it did was remind me of a not-too-proud era of American history and that's not really something I care to remember when I'm just trying to kill some time with a good book.I liked the flashback to Oxford in the 70s, where we were shown ""firsthand"" accounts of our main characters. It did prove to make them more sympathetic. But, the pacing of the story was terrible and the resolutions to the conflicts laid out in this story were subpar, at best.I'm usually a big fan of Sisman's work, but this does not get my stamp of approval. You'd really do better to just read a Clinton biography or some of the media publications from his original campaign for the White House."
4,Nice product,"I've played with a few types of tablets, but never could afford any of them o.0 However when I came across the Genius seres I debated that it might be so cheap because it was some how defective. Now that I have one I can't think of how I managed art with a mouse. It works great with GIMP on Win 98, and XP. The only problem I have found is the program not reading the mouse after using the tablet, along with minor lags. I find this a minor inconvenience, well worth the price, and great if it is your first tablet. It takes around 2 or 3 days to master it, and after a week you'll be zipping around your art with your tablet. Also the hot keys can be reset to run what ever programs you like, instead of the presets."
1,They Don't Work,"The Neru Patch is the 2nd type of detox foot pad I have tried. I loved the first ones (not sold on Amazon), but they were expensive. I opted for Neru because they seemed to have the same ingredients as all the others. Plus, I figured I'd start with the cheapest. This is a case of getting what you pay for. The patches didn't turn black they were brownish not unlike apple cider vinegar, which they smell of.I bought 3 packs (one for myself and each of my sisters). My sisters have never used patches or any detoxification and the patches still were light brown not black. It didn't work on any swelling or leg pain for any of us. We all had to use tape a couple of times to get a few patches to stick. My sleep was not positively effected. They just don't work. Do yourself a favor and try another type."
1,Backwards !!,"Unfortunately If anything I went backwards with these pads, I woke up and my feet hurt more.I have tried them twice and had the same results, all I can tell you is they don't work for me."
3,Just ok,I'm not sure if this helped my leg pain or it couldve been the 1000 my of motrin I was taking. I found that the pads didn't stay on my feet very well. I had to wear a sock to keep the pad on my feet. I didn't notice any difference in my leg pain in the mornings. I would not buy again. I would buy the Lavender Detox foot pads instead.
3,Not bad...,"Quick, simple, and to the point:You only get one new song on this disc, Complications of the Flesh. Yes, it sucks at first, but in time, it surely will grow. Also, there's a extended(just a bit) version of the Perfect Drug, a already excellent song. Not to mention, WITT is a excellent song nonetheless.Pick it up if you want to collect."
1,Don't waste your time!,"I don't know what I was expecting, but this movie was really bad. I didn't watch the whole thing. The quality of the video wasn't very good, guess it was restored from vhs or something. But anyway, don't waste your time."
1,Sucks big time,"Sucks Big Time ! Poor quality extremely low budget. Crappy and boring ! Better off with film 'Mandingo"" with Ken Norton."
1,Mandinga,The audio was ahead of the video. The picture quality was poor on and off throughout the video. It's not one I would recommend purchasing at this time.
1,Mandinga,"Do not waste your time, at this awful awful movie.... it was the must low budget movie I have ever seen."
1,Bad Idea,I thought that people were being to harsh on the reviews but now I see that they were right about this movie. It was really bad and I did not even finish it.
3,So SO.,Nothing great. Lacking excitement. Cover is very misleading. Readers expected more. Maybe next one will be better and contain more excitement.
2,"No, not for me","This was not what I was expecting from the movie. The story line was sort of awkward for me. I'm sorry, But I never finished wathing the movie."
2,Rainy night movie,This story line was dull and lifeless. Yet there were some wierd involvement between the slaves and the wild wanna be female master/mistress. I think that a believeable story line with good scences would have made this better. Watch this on a rainy night if you looking for soft porn.
2,it is hardly worth two stars. It's closer to one.,"poorly written, poorly acted; poorly filmed. Had I known in advance how poor it was I wouldn't have purchased it.."
3,Exhorbitant,How can you justify this exhorbitant premium- the new updated 2nd edition (2005)is available direct from the author's site at US$67.00 including airmail.Is this a case of gullible's travails or are you a slease-bag?Caveat emptor!
1,Not really about Meister Eckhart,"This is a very interpretative take on the thought of Meister Eckhart, and one person's new-age seventies-style musings. I was hoping for for additional insight into the writings and teachings of Meister Eckhart and so was disappointed and will probably rarely open the volume."
4,Dust!,"Whoa!!! They overexaggerated about cutting down on dust - this thing makes a huge mess. But it does a pretty good job, and I know from past experience how Hardiboard will kill blades not meant for it. My cuts have some small pieces that need to be knocked away (by hand), but they come out fairly clean. Definitely a good thing to have around if you ever cut fiber cement board."
1,Not good,"I tried using this blade to cut Hardilap siding. It got hot quickly (very thin blade)after one or two cutsand started to wobble causing ragged cuts. I bought a CMT blade for $20 and it was farbetter, it made clean cuts. Very diappointed with blade, worthless."
5,Did the job,"I used this blade for cutting Hardiboard for my house remodel. I did a lot of cutting with this blade and it still looks as good as when I bought it. I was not sure at first because it's kind of pricy, but it's worth it. I really actually wished now that I'm done that I would have bought a 10"" for my miter saw in addition to this blade for my skil saw."
5,Hardiblade is an excellant product,I used a Hardiblade in my Radial Arm saw and another in my circular saw while installing Hardiplank siding on my daughters house. The cuts were straight and clean. This was the first time I have installed cement siding and I was a little apprehensive about cutting and nailing the siding. The blades cut much easier and with much less chipout and dust than the carbide blade I tried at first.I would reccommend this blade for any cutting of cement siding.
4,Does the Job,"I started my siding job with a Piranha carbide blade in my circular saw because the Hardiblade I ordered had not shown up.After one afternoon of work I could see the blade was wearing out and was sparking on the cement board, indicating the carbide teeth were burning up.When I got the Hardiblade I put it on and continued work. Noticed right away that it slings less dust and it lasts for a loooong time. I made quite a few long rips with it and it cut very easily.Do I think these blades are worth the very high price? Nope, they can't cost that much to manufacture.Do I regret buying it instead of trying to use carbide blades for the whole job? Nope.It's a good blade."
3,"Does a good job, but should cost half as much.","This blade does a good job of both ripping and cross cutting fiber cement siding. It is however, far too expensive for what it is. It is a thin kerf steel blade with four tiny teeth tipped with diamond dust. I think the blade accounts for 25% of the cost and the name HardiBlade accounts for the rest."
3,A LITTLE OVER HYPED!,"In overall, I love Slave! I have been a die hard Slave fan since the 70's when they first came out. This CD is OK. It is definitly not FORMER MEMBERS OF SLAVE all the way. The only two cuts to me that bring the funk are One Lonely Heart, and It's Time To Party. Forever I'll Be There is good too. Now, This is 2006, and I'm just checking this CD out, and it claims 1999, I've been once again caught sleeping. In closing I'd like to say that this CD is still good R&B. In the east coast,esp. N.Y., We don't get a lot of funk. So thanks to the internet, I am now awake. I am an O.G. Funkateer, so I am out there searching for the funk. Whatch for my reviews, 'cause they will guarantee to br on the one. P.S. I would like to know whatever happened to that off group of Steve Arrington's Hall of Fame called Legion. I have a 12"" Single of the jam Guarantee. Did they ever have an album?"
2,?,"I'm not sure why this book has so many positive reviews. I read it a few years ago for an acting class,and was neither engaged or inspired by this book. While some of the techniques are helpful you could find the same info in another acting book. I would advise going to a bookstore first and reading parts of it before you decide to buy it online."
2,Not really worth it,"It's a very quick read with some small interesting theories and tidbits but altogether very very out-dated and in my opinion, no longer has any relevant information to give today's actor. These techniques have already been surpassed and the book can be at times very stupid and quite sexist. It's really not worth your time or money. I would only suggest this if you were bored and wanted to kill some time on a long bus ride. But I wouldn't suggest that you take most of the things in this book into practice. Times have changed..."
4,Excellent Handbook,"This is an excellent book that I call a handbook because it must be returned to over and over. The lessons are in the form of dialogues/conversations between teacher and student.The lessons are: Concentration, Memory of Emotion, Dramatic Action, Characterization, Observation and Rhythm.This is a very basic yet infinitely deep series on the tools that an actor needs, which Boleslavsky draws out of his pupil, here called The Creature. The antiquated nature of the relationship seems of the time, 1933, and though that may distract from the substance, it rapidly becomes as much a device as the dialogue/conversation format used to express the lessons.I could pick this up and open to any lesson and mine that for a time. These lessons are not mastered, rather they are practiced."
5,This great book made me realize how much I love this art!,I love this book! It is perfect for anyone who loves acting and wants to make it their life! I learned so much and my passion for this art was even greater when I was through!!! If you love acting then you'll love this book!!!
1,Worst book to ever buy,"This book does not give helpful hints...It is written by some crazy man who refers to his reader as ""creature"" and he talks to himself....I prefer Acting Games : Improvisations and Exercises ISBN: 0916260925 to this one."
3,Lousy Layout,"Overall, the book was interesting in spite of the heavy-handed attempts at humor. Peters shows some knowledge of the cars but obviously lacks first-hand experience of them. I could not give the book more than 3 stars because of the layout editor's idiot use of different color type over varying colored backgrounds. Makes the book difficult to read and detracts quite a bit."
3,not what I expected,"I'm a secretary, and I had a book with the same title I though it was a updated version. But for me is not what I was needing. My grandchild will give it good use."
5,Good Book,"This is a great book, I started back to college after 8 years of no school and it really helped me brush up on my writing and spelling...."
5,Something Most All of Us Could Use,"I have both, Write Right! and Rewrite Right! in my essential writer's bookshelf, and use both often.I love Jan Venolia's approach, info and style, and Lord knows we can nearly all use some help now and then with those pesky sentence fragments, spellings, and all the other horrors we confront daily in our quest to be not only read, but understood and enjoyed.I've used Jan's sane advice in crafting both my books."
4,Good reference,"I keep this book on my desk for easy reference. Many times people have questions that can be found here in a jiffy. The basics are usually what trip people up. The book contains proper usage of often times miss-used words. Like ""further and farther"", ""lie and lay"" as well as verb tense and agreement. I recommend it for anyone who wants to use good grammer."
1,At least get Butch's real name right,How can one trust a book that can't even get the name of Butch Cassidy correct. Robert Leroy Parker is the real thing using George only perpetuates the untruths and casts doubt on the rest of the work.
1,Setting the Record Straight,George Cassidy was the alias Butch was using when he was arrested for horse theft. His actual name was Robert LeRoy Parker.
3,"Nice, but not what is pictured here","Overall, it is a nice cup -- good weight, nice finish. But... the image pictured here is not the design you get (or, at least, what we got). The one sent to us is more bulbous at the base and does not have the beading along the lip. The handle however is the same. I'm not sure if this was a mistake on the manufacturers part or a listing mistake by amazon. I don't plan to try to exchange it as this was a registry gift purchase by a friend and the cup sent will do just fine... but, again, it would've been nice to receive what was advertised."
2,"Not a ""keeper""","I was not impressed. Many of these pedestrian recipes are ""carribean"" mainly on account of the addition of an ingredient such as soy sauce, or lime juice, or coconut oil (for frying). I gave it away."
3,Very specialized book,"This book is appropiate for people with broad background in UMLEven this edition is 2003, is not easy to understand for begginersIt has a lot of information about specific areas related to UML, but not to UML exactly"
4,Webbie Da Savage,Webbie Come Hard on most cds Dis CD Is Hard 2 but Yall Need 2 go get dat Savage Life when it Drop
1,Webbbie the Fa*got,"Webbie aint no gangsta, Geto Boys will run up to that punk a$$ kid and tell it to his face then smack him and Bootsie's 14 year old punk a$$. Webbie never bust no gun, never seen jail, he aint a gangsta hes a studio gangsta. you think im supposed to take a 19 year old child that serious???"
1,The responses to my original post are very humorous!!!,"In my original review I wrote that for any guitarist to be good he has to atleast be able to solo or shred, which is very true. Then some dumba$$ replied soon after that there are many guitarists that are good that do not solo and shred. I laugh!!! I want a list of these so called guitarists. So in retrospect then you are saying that kurt cobain was just as good as let's say Stevie Ray Vaughn, Jimi Hendrix, Joe Satriani, or Jimmy Page? I think not. Some other replies that have given them 5 stars have admitted that his music was extremely simple, but he made it sound good therefore he is good. My friends $hit that smells good is still $hit. Think about it!!!!!!"
1,Another Talentless Overhyped Band by Punks...,"i mean i couldnt think of a more useless band and this is soposedly their peak? please if this is a bands peak they should have just quit before ever starting , yes i am a pearl jam alice in chains and soundgarden fan. But even though people classify nirvana with those bands of that era , talent wise nirvana is no where close all the other bands. Over all of the so called "" grunge"" era bands the overrated punk band as in nirvana gets blow away by the rest."
1,NEVER BUY THIS ALBUM! NOT A WORTH BUYING AT ALL!,"I HAVE GOTO SO MANY FRIENDS WHO DO LOVE NIRVANA, AND SOMETIMES I LISTENED TO THIS ALBUM. I AM NOT KIDDING, ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS: THIS ALBUM IS NOT A WORTH BUYING! PURE GARBAGE IN THE ENTIRE ALBUM! SILLY LYRICS! REALLY HORRIBLE! ""SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT"" IS ONE OF THE WORST SONGS I EVER LISTENED TO. DO YOURSELF A HUGE FAVOUR: GO ON AND BUY ""EXILE ON MAIN STREET"", ""LET IT BLEED"", ""BEGGARS BANQUET"" AND ""STICKY FINGERS"" FROM THE ROLLING STONES INSTEAD. AND ENJOY REAL ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC!KURT COMPLAIN (OOOOPS, COBAIN!) WAS NOT TALENTED AT ALL! I GUESS HE IS URNING IN HELL NOWADAYS. HE WAS A REAL LOSER! HIS BEST SOUND WAS WHEN HE PULLED THE TRIGGER ON THE GUN AGAINST HIMSELF! MANY BEATLES ALBUMS ARE AS GOOD AS THE STONES ONES. GO ON AND BUY REVOLVER OR SGT. PEPERS LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND. THANK GOD THE 90'S ARE OVER!"
1,"Nirvana = the worst band of ""the big 4""","Nirvana was a joke. Kurt was a fraud. go listen to Bob Dylan albums instead, go listen to Neil Young, dont listen to Kurt... he was nothing but a fake"
1,I VOTED 1 STAR BECAUSE NIRVANA WAS A 1 STAR BAND,I dont like Nirvanathey werent goodLed Zeppelin is better than NirvanaPearl Jam is better than ZeppelinNobody is better than Pearl JamNirvana sucks & will be forgotten cus only teeny boppers like them
1,AWFUL!,"To say the very least. Who thought signing this ""band"" was a good idea? I hope it is a very long time before we hear another band this ""important"". This definitely doesn't ""Wack me"" (sic) nostalgic. Just a horrible bunch of bad songs, poorly played."
1,sloppy,"this cd is one of the worst cd's i have ever heard . it has to be the most overrated cd by the most overrated band in history. the vocals by the dead guy make no sense and just sound terrible. the guitars lack focus and the drumming of grohl is just sloppy. metallica's cd is much better, and the longevity of its popularity proves it."
1,Dated plagarism,If this had been released 20 years earlier it may have been contemporary bop-rock. It is merely recycled 70's run-of-the-mill mediocrity with some crude lyrics and mild obscenities to entice kids to think it's 'cool'. This is blatant kid rip-off music and if this was the best that Kurt Cobain could muster then it is no wonder he felt a failure and committed suicide.
2,Let up on Nirvana; they're on par with Pearl Jam.,"Oh please. Whomever keeps saying Pearl Jam is better than Nirvana needs to let up. Pearl Jam is worse than Nirvana, yet I despise both. They both sold out. Vedder gladly obliged to be a media puppet, and Kurt knew what he was getting into when he signed with a major. Yet Kurt still didn't care to fufill what was asked of him. He had always been lazy, and Nevermind reflects that. It's pure pop-rock on par with Bon Jovi, and he refused to admit it. There's no punk sensibility to it at all."
3,I'm so happy 'cause today I found my wound/It's in my head,"The above's my fave lyric from Nevermind. I know everyone else mishears and misinterprets what Kurdt says in his songs, but I know what I'm talking about and I'm the only one who could have the strength to peer into the abysmal eternal darkness that is Cobain's soul and wisdom. I heard it from the grunge king himself (in a quote from a 1995 concert in the wilds of the Amazon down here in South America). Cobain's image is so cool and dangerous. Punk rockers like us know NIRVANA (remember, it's spelled in all caps like KurDt spells it) is all about gloom and sitting around hoping for new happy revolutions of the governmental wheels while we do nada about nothin'. Sitting is an action, right? Well then, that means if us NIRVANA fans sit around long enough, we'd be taking action. Yay. Buy Nevermind. It rox. That's with an ""x"" and not a ""cs"". It's more punk that way."
3,It's ok.,"Yeah....that's right. JUST o.k. I like tracks 1-3, 5 and the last song, Something in the Way. I'll say it, I don't really care for Nirvana, I don't think that they're the best because Cobain killed himself. In fact, I don't even enjoy Tupac! So sue me! Seriously though, this album is overhyped but good and I can see how it would have moved people away from new wave/MJackson pop groups."
3,Its not as great as it seams,"It wasn't this album that save the rock world it was thap prep song smells like teen spirit and from Kurts point of view he diddn't like that song one time at a concert he played the first part of it (right when the drums kicked in) he quit said ""i dont guess we will play that tonight"" and walked off stage. in fact kurt diddnt even own a copy of this album he diddn't like it i'd say buy in utero insted its a better album. I am a huge nirvana fan don't get me wrong but i diddn't like teen spirit like alot of other nirvana fans there r some good songs like lithium and all the other songs on this cd but all you hear is smells like teen spitit this and teen spirit that... its not the only song on this cd all the other ones are better."
5,"F*** achilles last stand, and F*** the Beatles","First of all, I'd like to say something directly to the reviewer ""achilles last stand"". Kurt Cobain was a rock god and the voice of a generation, and anybody who says things like you did about him deserves do be crucified. So next time you feel the urge to talk s***, just hold it in. To all people who are looking for a great album, buy it. 'Nuff said."
3,"One Song, One Sound","Though the 90's have long since passed into oblivion, I had to get this CD, finally, to see what all the fuss was about. I really like some of the songs; and the songs do have a unique and distinct sound. For this, I gave the CD three stars.I have no reason to question the claims by many commentators that this CD had a major influence on the music of the 90's. However, let's be honest, really: the songs are all very similar, with the same groove and even similar melodies. A good sound, a hard groove that appeals to a majority of teenaged minds that are not accustomed to depth or variety, and minds that have no desire to challenge themselves musically.And so it goes: I heard it; I liked the essentially one song or sound; now I am ready to move on. Good but higly overrated."
4,BIG HITS,"There are a few great tracks off this! 4 of them are hits. Otherthan 4, this is a week cd!! Buy it mostly for SLTS. NIRVANA ROCKSTHAT SONG ON THE RADIO!!"
5,I Would Say That Nevermind Is Essential,"I would say that Nevermind is essential Nirvana, but so are a few other albums from them. If you like Nirvana, get this album, In Utero, and Unplugged in New York. That should be enough excellent Nirvana music to keep you satisfied."
3,Don't listen to the reviews,"This is a good album but it is not a great album and it really is overrated.What happened is Kurt Cobain died and suddenly everthing he touched was supposed to be a masterpeice. Not so. There are only about 5 songs on this album that are truly good and the rest is filler.I think that it is kinda of a joke to put this album on all time best lists. It's so obvious that the only reason this album is considered a great album is because Cobain was a drug addict and killed himself. While I do consider him a good stylist and lyricist, this album does not merit any special attention.Shame on you Rolling Stone magazine. Guess you had to sell magazines or maybe some of your staff and Cobain had the same dealers."
2,Overated,I dont like Nirvana. The only reason this album was so well accepted during that time period was because it was different and there was nothing else going on. I gave it two stars for the songs that It taught me in my first week of guitar playing. The drummer wasnt too much to brag about either.
3,to avril fan...,"IMO your choice of music SUCKS!!!sorry had to get that out of my system anyway...i like most types of rock that there are. thats right and guess how many ""good""cds(your good cds)do i have?none thats right NONE i love led zeppelins cds most of the beatles cds and tons of others which worst songs are better than anything you say you like...oh yeah btw the reason that noone plays clapton and those other guitar gods(JIMI HENDRIX!!!) is because modern music(i amj not calling it rock)smothered and killed rock. Nirvanna tried to resurrect it but it was too late rock has died and now kids everywhere are going to grow up likeing that crap...oh well...oh yeah and this cds sucks as it is missing a lot of great songs...IMO anyway"
2,Nirvana Nevermind,"Nirvana's Nevermind really kicked things off for the early 90's Seatle Grunge movement. A new sound for a new decade, Nirvana and other grunge groups put an end to the popularity of the 80s pop/metal movement. While, Nirvana is an alright band, but I don't consider Kurt Cobain the musical genious that many people claim he his. Kurt wrote some really good songs, but Nevermind isn't really a masterpiece by any means. Smells Like Teen Spirit, and Come as You Are are very good songs, and Nevermind is an enjoyable listen every once in awhile, many of the songs don't leave a lasting impression. If you're a teenager you'll probably want Nevermind, but since they have a greatest hits album I'd recommend that as a starting point to new fans."
3,I wanna Be Fair To Other Music,"Actually From what i heard when i listened to the album was that,it's nothing special,totally overhyped by people.I don't care who Kurt cobain is coz he's just another frontman of a rockband.The thing is that,you go to any record store and purchase any rock album by artist like staind,you find that nirvana and staind are pretty similiar,lyrics about teens angst.But the thing is that staind is bashed heavily by critics.I don't understand why people like to follow blindly but personally i felt that nirvana is an ok band,nothing much,if you want to know what good band is go check out radiohead,muse,and a whole lot out there."
5,they smell nice,"i enjoy the spring breeze and cheese on a hot day. Nirvana sounds good on a fly. They taste like martinis on wednesday, and brussel sprouts in febuary.buy this cd at least 20 timees, before my dog eats it."
3,"Important, but overrated","Nevermind brought teenage rage, and the grunge rock scene all onto center stage with one fell swoop....Its circumstances are groundbreaking, a few songs essential...But as a CD of music, and not a movement, its simply an average late80's early 90's heavy rock disc with above average gloom lyrics....It gets off to a good start, but for the most part (polly excepted) its not a very versatile or ""classic"" disc..."
3,OK if grunge is what you want,"I actually enjoy most of this album, if I'm in the right mood for it. But best of all time? Give me a break.Thank God the whole grunge nonsense that Nirvana started finally WENT AWAY. Man, it sure took long enough. What a bust that was. A whole lot of muddled noise and awful stuff pretending to be music.That said, if you want grunge, Nirvana did it the best, and this is their most accessible album. Again -- if you're in the right mood for it -- it can be fun. But it sure isn't something I'd call the best music ever made. If everyone felt that way, the grunge movement would still be going strong. But it petered out pretty fast. Thank God for that."
2,Extremely overrated.,"Sure, it has a few good catches to it, but even the best songs are very boring after the first few listens. What makes it so very unenjoyable to me, however, is that there is no proof why Kurt is put on guitar magizines and classified with very talented guitarists such as Jimmy Page, Eddie Van Halen, Gilmour, Hendrix, pre-non-heroin Clapton. Sorry..., I just don't understand."
2,mediocre,"The one good thing about Nirvana and the grunge movement is it got rid of drum-machines and over-produced music. Here you've got gritty drums and guitar. But the sound--aside from its more natural feel than Billy Ocean type crap--is monotonous, and has no ""charisma"" or personality to it. Every song sounds the same. And Cobain's lyrics are nothing special. That Nirvana should be considered the great band of the 90's shows how little the 90's has had to offer."
5,Nevermind is a Cool Album,"Nevermind by Nirvana Corvin DettlaffThe first track, ""Smells like teen spirit"" is probably the most popular song by Nirvana on this Album. You can listen to this album anytime, because it fits nearly every mood. The only bad part about the CD is Track number six, called ""Polly."" It is just a song made to fill up the space on the CD. It has no quality what so ever. The lyrics are boring and have no point. It is about a parrot that wants a cracker. This parrot is called Polly. And the song continues...The part that is ruined by ""Polly"" is replaced by a secret song, but this secret song is not on all CD's. About 13 minutes after the last song, ""Something in the way"" has finished, there is a secret song, called ""Endless Nameless"" It is a different style of music from all the other songs on this CD. For the people who like this style of music, this is a great song to finish of the CD as a last song."
5,One of the Best CD's ever,"Nirvana at their best (when aren't they at there best). This CD has great tracks like Smells Like Teen Spirit, Lithium, Drain You, every track is awesome. BEST CD EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!! Must buy."
5,NIRVANA ROCKS,"I LOVE NIRVANA> Buy this CD fast, you will love it! Nothing compares to Nirvana, trust me you will love every song! i listen to it everyday, and i never get tired of it, neither will you!"
4,Their only good album..,"Nirvana's debut album ""Bleach"" was undoubtedly their worst effort, which was nothing but a Mudhoney (who sucked) ripoff. They tried to fit in with the Seattle grunge scene, but it wasn't meant to be. Nirvana's true calling was MTV music videos, selling out stadiums and forever having songs for teenage boys to play on guitar, and that's why they're so great! ""Nevermind"" is not only full of catchy songs with angst-ridden lyrics, but Nirvana ended up having a lot of cool t-shirts sold at Hot Topic, so it's win-win. Also, avoid their later works because Kurt started name-dropping Leonard Cohen (ugh) and covered lame bands like Meat Puppets."
4,Awsome!,"This was Nirvana's ticket to success! Just take the first 9 seconds of the first track and you'll hear rock history in the making and a music revolution begin.If you like:Pearl Jam's ""Ten""Soundgarden's ""Superunknown""Greenday's ""Dookie""Everclear's ""Sparkle and Fade""Stone Temple Piolets's ""Core""Jawbreaker's ""24 Hour Revenge Therapy""Than this CD will blow your mind. from the hardcore sound's of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and ""Territorial Pissings"" to the depressing acoustics of ""Something In The Way"" and ""Polly"" Nevermind is gold through and through. Possibly the best grunge album ever!"
2,"Definately not the 90's best album, not even Nirvana's","This album is OVERRATED. Almost every song has the same chords, just played at a different speed or octave. ""Come As You Are"" is by far the most overrated song ever. The lyrics are incoherent, but I will admit they are cool. ""It's okay to eat the fish/ they don't have feelings.""(Something in the Way) This album did ruin rock, inspiring Nu-Metal and all that garbage we hear on the radio and MTV today. But, Nirvana did pave the way for the other ""grunge""(I hate that word) bands that actually had some talent to get big, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam(Kind of). If you have to get a Nirvana album, get Bleach. Also, to the reviewer AFI K James, stop reviewing this album, you've reviewed it 12 times, we get it, you don't like it, once is enough."
3,OVERRATED!!!,"Thus album is and will always be THE MOST overrated album ever. Im not saying it was all bad, but it by no means lived up to its hype. There were about 4 to 5 good songs in total and the rest were complete filler. But the main problem with this album was that it overshadowed the better releases of the year such as Soundgarden's ""Badmotofinger"". Nirvana was overrated but it did influence many albums to come so it wasnt all bad. Another good group destroyed by over commercialism and damn MTV."
2,well...,"I will be the first to say, yes, I don't get it. I have listened to so many musical genres, i still don't see what the big deal with this is. IN UTERO was a fantastic album and really shows where the early nineties should start. The overproductionalized songs on here are ok. I don;t see what is so great and his lyrics are interesting. I am not one to get all ga ga over many albums, but that's my story."
5,The masterpiece that defined a generation!,"My favorite band is Led Zeppelin, my favorite song is ""Stairway To Heaven"", and my favorite album is NEVERMIND! This album contains some of the greatest material ever recorded. It is by far Nivana's masterpiece. The realistic angst in Kurt Cobain's words are the deepest and most truthful ever written. 5 stars is not enough to say just how much i love this album! It will without a doubt go down in history with such albums as Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, Zeppelin IV, Are You Experienced? and Nevermind The Bollocks. The best songs on Nevermind are: ""smells like teenspirit"", ""in bloom"", ""come as you are"", ""lithium"" and ""drain you"". I will continue to crank this masterpiece landmark album forever more!!!!"
5,music scene minus nirvana would=less future for rock,"green day wouldn't have even made it past playing gigs in public restrooms, basements and livingrooms if it wasn't for nirvana. kurt cobain might've been self-loathing, but at least he had the capacity to be have empathy, and he sure as heck had a little dignity left in him before april of '94. he treated his fans who loved his music very well, and sadly i can't say the same for billy who apparently thinks it's ok to be apathetic and destroy towards OTHER people's property. nirvana made rock popular again. if nirvana had never made it big green day wouldn't have taken their place. without nirvana, there would not have been the 'mini-music-revolution' in the early 90's. prove it to yourself and buy nevermind. fast shipping from the amazon... who could ask for more."
5,Pure Genius,"After reading some of the reviews written by people about this album, I must say I am a little disappointed. No, Kurt Cobain wasn't an excelent guitar player (The first songs I learned to play on the guitar were ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and ""Come As You Are""). It is also true that Kurt's songs were wrather simple (or not as complex as others of their time). This can mean only one thing. Cobain wasn't talented at all and ""Nevermind"" was in fact a work of Genius. As far as his vocals go, the singing on ""Nevermind"" is a deluge of spirit from start to finish. The music here is what you hope for when buying an album. A recording like this doesn't come around more than once a decade. Buy it and you'll understand what I'm talking about."
5,It don't get much better than this!,"This is some of the only decent music that's come out this decade. After this, rock music got crappy again."
1,A victim of The Loudness War (remastered album),"The original CD release sounds A LOT better than the remastered version (more dynamic) .The remastered CD is over-compressed to the point where there's clipping all over the place.Dave Grohl's drums sound flat and lifeless now. It's a shame that such a legendary albumgets such a terrible treatment.Google ""Loudness War"" to find out more about the technical details."
5,So much better than so many albums...,"This CD was so original, and still is. I consider it one of the best CDs ever. And for that guy that says it only took him a year to be able to play the songs on Nevermind, try writing a song."
1,Blarg.,"Whatever that means. Whatever anything means. Whatever did Nirvana mean? Nothing. Especially the corporate cop-out that is Nevermind. Bleach blew for various reasons, all of them being guitar chords and vocal cords being used incorrectly. Nirvana was ""special"" because they made having a lack of talent ""stylish"". So stylish that our whole freakin' pop culture has been enslaved by sh*tty music that FUSE and MTV continue to call ""indie"". Sorry, but if anybody other than 50 people know about and support a band, they ain't indie. Got a band that 51 people know about? Oops, you're mainstream. Thank You, Kurt Cobain... For continuing to assault us mercilessly with the ""legacy"" you have given teens. Nirvana has given music and hygene-challenged teens everywhere the inspiration to suck. Suck on!"
2,Two stars for two good songs.,"The only good songs on here are1. Smells like teen spirit2. LithiumThose are probably the best on the best songs you will find from Nirvana on this CD. everybody thinks that Nirvana is so good and stuff because they started to influence bands like Korn and Limp Bizkit. Well they did a good job on that and made them sucessful, but them, they just didn't make it. Nirvana is the very first version of Limp Bizkit but they are so old and different that they just aren't my type of music. if you're a fan of Nirvana and know them pretty well, then buy this album and I garuntree, you'll like it!"
1,Garbage,"Nirvana is The Worst Band Ever. Even Worse than Creed. They Just Suck. What is smells like Teen spirit about anyway? Lithium-WTF. Polly- What is he doing, raping a bird??? This is the wort album ever and the worst band ever. I'm glad kurt killed himself."
1,Crazy Liberal Propoaganda,"I have never seen such a display of vulgar Liberal Jiberal entertainment. They think that they are so tough with their long hair and instruments that make noise. This band is a Liberal wacko band, and they need to stop with all of this nonsense hoopla joopa in this day and age.Two hippies were walking by me and they were talking about the band. I told them tha they should not listen to it because it rots their brains with total garbage Liberal weirdo stuff.DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!GO REPUBLICAN!!!!"
1,3 Chord Drivel,"This album is the worst kind of trash....talentless noise...I swear we hate capitalism (hey david geffen, can you shoot us another million so we can make yet another overproduced, lame video for our target audience of 16 year old girls on MTV?)I cannot go on...the most over rated pile of rubbish ever recorded....not to mention it ruined the music scene forever....yuck...The only album that is worse is the barely decipherable In Utero.One final point....people seem to forget....the popularity of this trash was/is always massively overstated....this album sold about 9 million copies in the US....put another way...it would be Bon Jovi's Fifth most popular album."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This album is less than nothing. Kurt can't sing, and the band is clearly not talented with their instruments which is why they dive into repitition. Song writting also deserves a dis-honorable mention."
1,Forget This,"This album is horrible; you people quit praising it. I could get up there and scream my lungs out also. Why does everybody love Cobain? You should all listen to Pearl Jam and get enlightened. I listened to these guys before, but Eddie Vedder taught me the real ways. There are just mindless chords here and a guy screaming about how miserable his life is. Some people like that for some reason. Mike McCready and Stone Gossard are better guitarists than Cobain ever was. If you don't believe me, Rolling Stone just called Pearl Jam the seventh greatest rock band of all time and Nirvana wasn't in the Top Ten. Buy Pearl Jam's ""Vitalogy"". At least Vedder still makes music and faced his problems instead of being a coward and blowing his brains out. Sorry people, diss me if you want, but that's the way it is and you know it.P.S. Don't you dare say all Vedder does is scream about how miserable he is; listen to ""Yield"" and ""No Code"" and you'll see that's not the case."
5,"don't get me wrong, nirvana is much better than the beatles","What do you think of the Beatles????? They are overrated and old. But they have made a couple really good songs such as Hey Jude, The Ballad of John and Yoko, and Birthday. But they are still old. Nirvana is much better than the Beatles because theyatleast play more hard rock and heavy metal and this is one ofthe greatest albums containing 4 really terrific songs such as Smells Like Teen Spirit, In Bloom, Come As You Are, and Lithium.Don't get me wrong, I was born when this came out 1991 and this goes better together when you buy Metallica Black Album, Dire Straits On Every Street, and the Use Your Illusion anthologys by Guns N' Roses. Those just match this one. Go buy it with every album today...and one more thing, why did Kurt Cobain kill himself in 1994???????????Please buy it everyone.Nirvana is just as great."
1,This isn't music!,"Trust me, my mom has this CD at home and it makes me want to die. Nirvana is the worst band ever. And who wants a baby swimming around in the ocean NAKED trying to catch a dollar on a fishing line? Unfortunately, Nirvana. Guess what this CD smells like. It's not teen spirit. It's not Nirvana (if you have listened to Weird Al, you will get that joke). It smells like horrible, yucky, grunge music. Do NOT waste your money on this crud!"
1,Terrible music from a terrible band..,"You know, for as much hype as Nirvana gets, they really did write some mediocre music. They get remembered as ""legends"" for inventing trash called grunge and simply because Cobain killed himself like the martyr that he thought he was. I am not reviewing ""Nevermind"" specifically but I am moreover reviewing all of Nirvana's music, since this album is no less and no more garbage than the other 2 albums.This music completely lacks in depth, substance and any musical talent. The musicianship is extremely mediocre and childish and the songwriting is certainly no better. Isn't it wonderful that this kind of music burst onto the scene in the early 90's and displaced classic rock?Drop this music (not just Nevermind) but all of Nirvana and enlighten yourself with real music like Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, Yes and Queen. Cheers"
2,Pretty Good...,"But personally, I didn't like this album as a whole. Yes, it's a NIRVANA album, probably one of their best records ever made. But I listened to it for what it is without thinking about Kurt Kobain or the hype that the band got, which you have to admit would've been non-existent if it weren't for him. At the end, all i got was a mediocre rock record. Apparently, it spoke for a certain time and place in teen culture not too long ago, but it didn't speak for me. Also, Kurt Kobain's image also empowered the message of this album. The only song I liked on it was Smells Like Teen Spirit, while the rest to me either sounded the same, or just didn't have the same affect as SLTS. Sorry, I understand the big hype and praise for Nirvana, but not their music."
1,Changed the face of music...,"Rememeber back when having a hit actually took musical talent? Well, this is the album that changed all that!"
3,Overrated,When I was younger I used to listen to this album quite a bit. It's good despite the fact that the songs have been played to death. The only reason this album did so well is because the media blew it out of proportion. Soundarden and Alice in Chains had more talent. Chris Cornell is arguably the greatest vocalist of all the grunge bands and just about every song on Facelift could have been a single. Whereas Nevermind had a few great songs a few decent songs and some filler. I would have givin Nirvana 4 stars if they weren't so overrated. Some people just listen to music to fit in.
1,Fade the VH1 Poll,"The VH1 Poll only included musicians and critics, so it obviously reflects the herd mentality. Of course the #1 album would be by the Beatles. Of course many of the top 10 would be by the Beatles. And of course among the top 10 would be records by rock's fallen heroes - Marvin Gaye, Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix, etc.This album wasn't any good when it came out, and age hasn't helped. Don't buy the hype."
1,Seriously...,"Album and music are classic and superb... The ""remastering"" is horrendous! Terrible clipping, distortion all over the place. If you want an easy test just purchase the MP3 versions of Lithium off the remastered edition and the original single album. Vocals are distorted, percussion is muted by overboosted guitar and bass. Give me a break! There is next to no dynamic range and compression distortion everywhere. Read the other reviews, this is noticeable even with modest listening equipment. Skip the remastered and get the original."
3,Bummer.,I received this 4 LP set in the mail yesterday. It's pretty great....meaning it looks pretty great on my shelf.
1,Nirvana hid behind a wall of gloss because they blew,"""Nevermind"" is one of the biggest cop-out excuses for an album ever. You'd think that a band with such a slick record could replicate that sound onstage. Or come close to it. But as many of us would-be Nirvana fans found out when we bought ""Muddy Banks,"" this band blew live. I'm sorry, but Nirvana never could match the cut-and-paste studio job that Butch Vig did for them. Nirvana's Nevermind is just as overproduced as anything from Janet Jackson, Guns & Roses, and Poison. But at least those three bands used the studio gloss to enhance what talent they already had. Nirvana just used that wall of gloss to hide behind and cover up the fact that they couldn't sing or play their instruments. Go buy a super-glossed album from a band that can play and sing. Might I suggest Boyz II Men's ""Cooleyhighharmony"" or Primus' ""Pork Soda""?Hells yes."
1,Nirvana sucks f***ing a**,"I hate nirvana, they are the worst band in the freakin universe, how could anyone like them? I think that anyone who comitts suicide shouldnt sell records. Take my advice and don't even consider them.peace out!ps rap sucks even worse!"
2,Pretty good album,"This album is ok buts its kind of dull in places Its not the worst album in the world. Neither is it the best. The best album in the world is the Stones Exile on Main Street but hell, thats just my opinion and if you like Nevermind then good for you."
5,HISTORY,"Girls - girls .... take it easy , for crying out loud.This is one of the most important albums of the 90 ' s - like it or not.I enjoy the power and their sound , which is quite unique.Play it loud."
4,Nirvana legend,"This album started the Nirvana legend.Smells Like Teen Spirit is my personal favourite in this album,Lithium is a killer and Come As You Are,Something In The Way,Polly are great."
2,Dung,Not just a regular pile of dung. An extremely insanely overrated pile of dung. That is the perfect way to sum up Nirvana and this album.
1,There Is A reason this is retailing at 20% off,"Oh dearI just don't get this Nirvana thingSo Bland - Simple - StraightforwardIF you like that - great - go for it - not for meWhat annoys me is people saying how great the instrument playing is, the structure and the vocal delivaryAll poor - Are people scared to diss a dead man?Songwriting pretty good. But I think alot of ""meaning"" came into the songs after he killed himselfI don't like Nirvana - factDon't hold it against me!But I'm a man who likes complex structure and riffs e.t.ce.g. AFINevermind is grunge and grunge is dead- Nuf said"
3,good album !!!! but no masterpiece !!!!,"nevermind is a solid rock album ,butt there is no moment it reaches 5 star quality !!!real overrated,listen to dylan the stones the beatles undertones the jam neil young steely dan little feat doors howlin wolf muddy waters louis armstrong bix beiderbecke the kinks the who led zeppelin elvis jerry lee lewis buddy holly gene vincent benny goodman miles davis john coltrane hank williams jimi hendrixella fitzgerald van morrison bob marley the allman brothers heifetz arthur rubenstein glenn gould fritz wunderlich james brown sam cooke .................................................................................................... !!!!!!!"
2,It's not worth the time,"What is this? This album is too overated just because of Cobain's passing. I guess it has a few good songs on it, definately not a great grunge album. This guy can't sing or play guitar! And it turns out that Dave Grohl, the drummer, is the talented one in the band after starting his own (Foo Fighters). If you want a good grunge album, get Stone Temple Pilots Purple or even Core...."
1,THE END OF MUSIC IS THIS,REAL SIMPLE PUT U GOT TO BE OUT OF YOUR MIND TO LIKE THIS GARBAGE THIS KILLED GOOD MUSIC LIKE GNR AND THE SCORPS AND MANY MORE
1,Flash-on-the-apn pop taken WAY too far,"This album has been caled things like ""Album of the Decade"", ""Voice of...."" and so on, but in reality it is to be classfied alongside Take That, Macarena and all that. From the retro-Monkees ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", through some gratuitous swearing, and some of the worst production in history, iy offers nothing worthwhile or productive. The only reason it is so ""legendary"" now is because Kurt killed himself. I remeber working in a CD store in early 84, just before the suicide, and we caouldn't give away ""Nevermind"" CDs!!! Then Kurt dies, and suddenly this is the greatest album of all time!! Please people. Nirvana were just the Backstreet Boys of 1991. If you like Teen-oriented Pop, good for you, but there is nothing spectacular whatsoever about ""Nevermind""."
1,Oh shut the hell up Nirvana fans.....,"Everybody, EVERYBODY is sick of Nirvana & Nirvana fans. at one point in time, nobody really cared, & lots more even LIKED nirvana... but now EVERYONE IS SICK OF NIRVANA AND HOW MUCH CREDIT THEY GET!!!! Nirvana does NOT deserve as much credit as the Cure, or Pearl Jam, or ALice in Chains, or the Smashing Pumpkins! down with Nirvana, everyone is so incredibly SICK & even DISGUSTED with them by now, just shut up about them, this album is NOTHING compared to ANY of the Cure's albums, and Pearl Jam's albums, thats a fact"
1,Nevermind listening to this hunk of junk,"This is quite possibly the worst cd that i have ever heard and want my money back. Every single song on the cd sounds the same. The bass lines are flat, drumming repetitive, and kurt cobain has no talent as vocals. If you want to listen to good grundge go buy some Stone Temple Pilots or Pearl Jam. This CD wouldnt be near as popular had the idiot not committed suicide."
1,MORE OVERRATED MTV JUNK,"This has been hailed as one of the greatest albums ever made.... WHY??! It is a horrible album.. Nirvana are sell-outs... This is stuff that MTV and the media TELLS you is cool... Not stuff that IS cool.. You wanna hear a good album... Hear ""ABBEY ROAD"" by the Beatles.. Ya Ya... You can criticize me and say that that's been hailed as one of the greatest albums ever made too.... but the media were darn right when they chose ""Abbey Road"".... No other song can compare to ""Something"" or ""Here Comes The Sun"". The Beatles are geniuses... Nirvana are not... Stop ranting and raving about Kurt Cobain being dead.... So what if he committed suicide? It's over and done with! Move on! We've got alot more things in life to worry about!"
1,Pure nonsense.....plain and simple!!!,"How long do we need to be subjected to the drug-crazed rantings of this bedwetter? Kurt Cobain is jack-assery personified!!! The music is simplistic...the singing is ridiculously awful...and the lyrics are something out of Marcia Brady's diary!!! On a scale of one to ten, this registers a 0.2. If Cobain really is the spokesman for his generation, I'm moving to the 1860's!!!"
5,One of the most revolutionary cds of all time.,"When Nirvana exploded into the scene in 1991, they rocked the airwaves. This is the origin of rock today. Its amazing thjis album is 11 years old. It just can't be. Buy it and listen to it. It is deep, it has hidden meanings in the songs. It is a rare cd where i can play it and not skip a track. The songs tunes are great. I can listen to this cd and it takes me to a differnt world. I think of Kurt and i swear its so good I almost cry when i think of his life and how he died. I have a cousin, he's 12. I gotta say, he saw one music video on mtv, downladed some songs, and two months later he has nevermind, in utero, from the mudy banks of wishkah, unplugged in ny, and bleach. he even has the bideo Live Tonight Sold out! I swear, listen to this, and hear the orignal. You'll love it."
5,THE GREATEST GROUP OF THE 90's,"This album is flawless. Every song on the album is great. I listen to it more than any other album that I own, and i never get bored of it. It is a pity that Cobain wasted his talent and brilliance. The world of music will remember THE GREATEST GROUP OF THE 90's"
3,The best rock album of all time? I don't think so: 3 1/2,"This album overated enormously, sure ""Smells Like Teen Spirit""and ""Come As You Are"" and the others are great songs, but as an album it is pretty rubbish, and Nirvana is really overated.However ""Nirvana Unplugged"" in my opinion is underated, if you have'nt heard the Nirvana Unplugged album. your missing out on alot.Sixteen Stone by Bush is a much better album, get that."
2,All myth and no substance,"To the teenager going through her stage of obsession with Nirvana and Kurt Cobain: It won't last, kid. All of us (myself included) went through that stage. When Muddy Banks was released it made me realize this band was a total mess. They couldn't play worth sh*t live. For some strange reason, Unplugged is the exception to that rule, but still, respecting Nirvana truly is a waste of admiration. Kurt hated his fans, and his live music shows. I guess he loved MTV though. His Unplugged show was quite listenable. The MTV execs scored him some black tar before the show started, so I supposed he felt an obligation to put on a good show for the network that undeservedly made him a superstar.Nirvana were a band of myth and no substance. But substance abuse was a different story. They had tons of that."
3,not really nirvana,not really nirvanaonly one awsome track drain you..the bottom line is that nevermind sucks bleach ruleshail floyed the barber
2,Just... stupid,"I don't see whats so good about Nirvana. Kurt Cobain was a very amateur guitar player, and he set the standards for modern rock guitarists lack of talent today (80% power chords, rarely any solos). Dave Grohl was a good drummer, but he was very very overrated. John Bonhom from Zep would kick his buttox anyday. Their bass player was good yet very boring, he wasn't an exceptionally skilled bass player like Flea from RHCP or Mike Dirnt from GD. Their lyrics were meant to make you feel ""depressed"", but I think they were just stupid. ""I think I'm dumb, I think I'm dumb, I think I'm dumb, I think I'm dumb"" I mean come on Kurt, we get the point already. ""Hello hello hello how low?"" WTF is this guy smoking? How can you call that good lyrics. Okay, some of his stuff is a little funny and clever like in Lithium, but overall its mostly stupid. I think these guys are only legendary now because Kurt killed himself. I didn't think they were anything good then, and I dont think their good now."
2,I'm just not feelin it...,"I honestly don't know what is so good about these guys. I can't relate to any of the lyrics because none of them seem to make sense to me. Kurt Cobain seems like he was just some drugged up dude who thought he was still a teenager and was angry at the world... real inspirational. The only half decent songs on here are Smells Like Teen Spirit and Lithium, because they are a little infectious."
3,"A masterpiece of Alternative, yet missing something","Kurt Cobain, was a tragic, misunderstood genious. It is horrible that his life ended so tragically at his own hands. From the wonderful song ""Come as you are"" to the haunting ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", his genious shines through. What he's missing is a wonderful duet with the lovely and talented, Celine Dion, the greatest singer ever. It is a devastating tragedy that the world will never get to hear the beautiful remix of ""Territorial Pissings"", in which I sang in perfect harmony (as usual, I am after all Celine Dion, the greatest singer ever), with Kurt. Courtney Love, who is not the greatest singer ever, is holding the recordings from the world. You can, however, look forward to me touring with Black Sabbath on their reunion tour."
5,Perfect,"A punk platter bashed out and produced to echo-ey, fuzz-box glory by Butch Vig. Either their ""sell out"" or their ""masterpiece"" depending on your view of things. There are not many CDs worthy of 5 stars. This and In Utero are two CDs well deserving of that ranking.Song for song, the best experience you can ask for. I've had this album since 1994 (when I was turned on to it from In Utero), and I'm still finding new things in the mix. I never realized the ""hospital sounds"" in Drain You, for instance.Any record that has one side composed of tunes like Smells Like, In Bloom, Come as You Are, Lithium, Polly and Breed (not necc. that order) is a cut above the morose junk on the airwaves.This ate both Michael Jackson and Metallica for breakfast when it exploded from nowhere in '91. It left behind a wake of snarl and wreckage that still hasn't been met face to face.Try to find ""Endless, Nameless"" if you can. Some pressings contain it, some don't. <i>Savage<i>."
5,Nevermind,Probably one of the best top 5 rock albums of ALL time. No kidding! Just buy this record and you'll know why. Sold an unbelievable 10 million copies. To go platinum is extremely rare for a rock album. Nirvana's nevermind is surely a must buy!
5,wow,"I Just bought this cd because my friend told me it was unbelieveable, and it has opened me to the world of the music i grew up with. As i heard the riffs of Smells like Teen Spirit, it sent shrills up my spine, and memories from 1st grade came back to me. Drain you is a great alternative surprise. Polly is also a very strong acoustic soung. On a Plain, is a huge highlight, if you like it check it out on Nirvana's unplugged album. Ending the the emotional and awesome something in the way, this is cd is a must for any early 90's grunge rocker."
2,IT'S JUST NOT AS GOOD AS PEARL JAM'S 'TEN'...,"its good... but I got 'Ten' first, & since Ten & Nevermind are considered the 2 groundbreaking albums at the time, I got Nevermind after TenIm mystified how anyone can think Nevermind is just as good, or better than something as magnificent as 'Ten'"
5,POW! IT'S A WINNER,"This cd absolutely, 100% lives up to it's hype.Not only does it have a collection of great, dynamic, and energetic songs but, it also was pivotal in it's release.Just as ""Never Mind the Bollock's, Here's the Sex Pistols"" did in the 1970's, ""Nevermind"" did for the 1990's.This changed the landscape of music.""Nevermind"" is essential listening in the history of rock and roll.Cobain killing himself even made the work that much more monumental."
3,"Good album, but doesn't live up to its reputation","First off, I will say that this isn't a bad album at all. Kurt Cobain wrote some great melodies and some great riffs, though they were simple. However, I don't see the ""lyrical genius"" that everybody raves about, plus they were hardly original. All Nevermind did was put a commercial gloss on a sound that had already been created by bands like the Pixies and Sonic Youth. The ONLY reason Kurt Cobain was EVER called a genius or ""spokesman for his generation"" was because he died young. Now the hype seems to be wearing off. The best things Nirvana did was open the door for other, better Seattle bands like Alice in Chains and Soundgarden, and it gave us Dave Grohl."
4,My Two Cents,"""Lounge Act"", for no apparent reason is my favorite song on this album. It is perhaps the essence of what Kurdt and co. were trying to achieve with this album: catchy hooks, and gut-wrenching screaming. Overall, a fun album, and not nearly as good or as bad as everyone says..."
5,THIS IS THE BEST CD OF NIRVANA!!,"This is the BEST cd ever...and it will always be(!). I've heard most of what Nirvana have made, and I haven't got more to say then; P E R F E C T"
4,The Greatest Nirvana album but.................,"Its hard to argue that Nevermind isn't Nirvana's best work or even the best album of the 90's, however the album does have its weak points. Teen Spirit remains an anthem and songs like Lithium and Come as You Are practically defined 90's rock radio, however songs like Territorial Pissings are nothing more than sophmoric thrash punk metal detours. The bland Lounge Act should have been replaced with an updated version of Swap Meet one of the better tracks off their first effort Bleach. The albumn needed a stronger finisher than the tandem of the acoustic ""something in the way"" and the secret track endless nameless, neither finsihes the albumn with strength the way, Pavement's Fillmore Jive finsihed CR,CR or the way Rocket Queen finished of the explosive Guns N Roses Appetite for Destruction. These are just minor fiobles, as this is still a great classic albumn, with the underrated Drain You being worth the price of admission alone."
5,The Sound of a Generation,"Countless people have written countless reviews and opinions about this album, but until you hear it and listen over and over to it, you can not feel the power and rage packed into this Seattle classic. Nirvana constructed a masterpiece of alternative rock that is still widely talked about almost 17 years after its release. ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" alone rocked a nation of youth that finally had a band truly representing them. Although I was much too young at the time this album was released to fully appreciate it, I heard it in its entirety a few years later and the music just seems to express any feelings of angst or depravity you might be feeling all wrapped up in pulse-pounding punk/alternative rage that just never quits. This album will live on as one of the greatest albums ever recorded."
5,nirvana's mainstream hit,"this is the album that brought nirvana into the mainstream as their first album, bleach, didnt do too hot at first. EVERY song on this cd is a grungerock masterpiece. my favs are smells like teen spirit, come as you are, breed, polly, drain you, lounge act, stay away and my personal favorite on a plain. the last song, something in the way is the only exception its a so-so song."
3,"I know I'm a little late for a review, but I have something to say.",First of all. Nirvana probably wouldn't be much of an issue today if Kurt didn't blow his brains out. I think that if Pearl Jam's frontman killed himself instead of Kurt then you would see a million Eddie Vedar shirts and Nirva would be where Pearl Jam is at right now. (Not all that great)But I'm not trying to take anything away from Nirvana. They were good. But just because Kurt wimped out and killed himself doesn't mean we have to hear their songs 11 years later every second of the day. Their not that great. No one would care about them if he was still alive. So lets drop this whole worship the dead thing and move on with our lives.P.S. I'd probably kill myself if I were married to Courtney Love too.
1,"Just let it go people, the grunge/alternative trend is OVER!","You Nirvana fans are so trapped in denial! Come on, admit it. Nirvana (and every other alternative rock band for that matter) were and are a joke! No talent what so ever. Nirvana didn't ""save rock n roll"". All they did was make it cool to do everything really half @ssed! People who think Kurt Cobain was a ""brilliant songwriter"" are just fooling themselves. It doesn't take a brilliant songwriter to put on a flannel shirt and mumble incoherently over a bunch of distorted guitar noise! I'm sure this stuff sounded cool to a 12 year old kid in 1992, but once you get past puberty, Nirvana just becomes a faded memory! Nirvana had no talent and was just a passing fad, much like Hanson or the Spice Girls!Come on Nirvana fans, its time to move on! This album is VERY dated, and belongs in the Museum of Pop Culture Fads, not in your cd collection! What a bunch of talentless hacks..."
1,NIRVANA=REALLY REALLY BAD MUSIC,"I hate Nirvana so much it's not even funny. One reason why I hate them is because i used to be a green day fan and i still have some green day spirit in me. If Nirvana didnt come out with Nevermind then green day would be so much more famous. another reason why I hate them is cause there music is so damn annoying.the only song i can even listen too without pukeing is teen spirit and i still hate that song. Rage against the machine now there's a good band. Zach de la rocha is one if not the best musician i have ever heard. sure the rest of the band isnt that special but they fit in perfectly. the only person i like in nirvana is david grohl because the foo fighters are pretty good. listen it's fine if you like nirvana, a lot of my friends like nirvana i just hate them. Listen to nirvana if you must but I strictly dont recomend it."
1,"""Nirvana Nevermind"" We all think this album is garbage","Earlier today a friend of mine told me that @ the weekend he watched a video of Mr Cobain sitting next to a radiator for about an hour on ""You Tube""That just about sums this album up ,1 of the worst albums known to man if it wasn't for Mr Grohl being the main man in this band I'd have given this album zero stars but Mr Grohl saved the album from total humiliation.The drumming on the album is superb the vocals are a bit dodgy though even if I do say so myself.I'd have killed myself much sooner if I was Kurt Cobain especially after listening to the album that I had made where the highlights of the album were just Mr Grohl.I hope I don't offend everyone with my superior reviewing abilities.Goodbye."
2,"NIRVANA SUCKS, METALLICA RULES!","WELL FOLKS, NEVERMIND SUCKS. METALLICA WERE MUCH BETTER THAN NIRVANA. KURT COBAIN JUST PLAIN SCREAMS ALONG WITH OTHER REALLY AWFUL SINGERS LIKE BON SCOTT, BRIAN JOHNSON, ROBERT PLANT, ANDSTEVEN TYLER. MOST OF THE SONGS ON NEVERMIND WERE THE WORST SONGS EVER RECORDED ESPECIALLY TRACK 1 WITH NO GUITAR SOLOS. WHY? THEY DON'T MAKE ANY LOVE SONGS EITHER LIKE DIRE STRAITS AND FOREIGNER. THIS IS NOISE!! DON'T BUY ANY ALBUM FROM NIRVANA, LED ZEPPELIN, AND AC/DC, ALL BANDS SUCK. DIRE STRAITS, FOREIGNER, AND METALLICA ARE THE BEST!!! NIRVANA SUCKS."
1,angry/Awful Awful loud white noise,"This music is just yelling and screaming it's ridiculuos. and angry and not healthy for human souls. And really really loud, so loud it makes Led Zeppelin seem like Kenny G. Amy Grant, Elton John, Eric Clapton, U2 and Garth Brooks are much more talented than this loud garbage"
1,None of you wouldve even heard of Nirvana without Pearl Jam,"I saw a review below that said nirvana ""inspired"" Pearl Jam... dude, what kind of drugs are you on? nirvana inspired Pearl Jam about as much as Poison inspired Led Zeppelin, kid. maybe you should look around a bit, i read an article on here that explains how pearl jam created nirvana, just get your info straight boy. & that brings me to this review, this album wasnt revolutionary... maybe in the mtv world, but this album could be called a rip-off of 'Doolittle' by the Pixies.. when Pearl Jam released 'Vs' in 1993, that was truly revolutionary, maybe not commercially, despite it being the fastest selling album ever, but it certainly was revolutionary musically, something nirvana has never done, but took credit for"
1,LAME LAME LAME,"Why not listen to a band with actual talent? Ever hear of Metallica, Megadeth, Iron Maiden, or Rush?NIRVANA sucks, and the only reason they are still praised is 'cuz Kurt swapped some 12-gauge buckshot upside his head."
1,THE BAND THAT CHANGED THE DEFINITION OF MUSIC...,Remember when music required a melody and (occasionally) thought-provoking lyrics? This is the album that changed all that.
1,Cheese,"That's exactly what this album is. A lot of people think it was Korn, but Nirvana were the true founders of this nu metal teen angst garbage. Just read the lyrics and you'll see what I mean. People regard Kurt Cobain as a genius? Judging by his performance he knows about three chords. Quit praising Nirvana. Grunge is dead and lets hope it stays that way. And go ahead and click the unhelpful button. I don't care what you think."
1,"The most overhyped, overrated album ever","Clearly the most overrated album of all time. A so-called alternative band spends a fortune recording an album with a successful pop producer and it's supposed to be some kind of rock and roll epiphany? This album is to alternative/punk rock what Poison or Warrant were to Heavy Metal. Additionally only one member of the band actually has any musical talent; Dave Grohl on the drums. Cobain probably blew his brains out because he realized he would be remembered for making an album that has as much artistic integrity as works by N'Sync or Brittany Spears. Don't buy the hype, this is the [worst] album produced in the 1990's."
1,Nirvana Never Could...,"do to me what it has done for others. I Remember when Nevermind first came out and i bought it and really had no connection to it whatsoever. To many people claim that Kirk was a genius, I disagree. This album is very boring, and very immature. Kirk Cobain Was just a well paid brat. The Only thing good to come from Nirvana is Dave Grohl. If You Want Real Music From This Era, Buy Ten From Pearl Jam."
1,"Terrible, aweful, bogus, hanous, most non-excellent!","Badly written songs, untuneful vocals, poor lyrics, non existent musicianship, sloppy guitars, simplistic bass, lacklustre drums, depressing imagery, appalling band, terrible album, don't buy it!"
1,"If you took AvrilFan serious, you're a dumb f*ck.","First off, I really don't like this album. It's sad that classics like Saimese Dream, Ritual De Lo Habitual, and Dirt get tossed away and crap like Nevermind gets put in as ""The album that started it all.""This album just started the downfall of what was music.Now, as for the people who actually took AvrilFan serious, congratulations, you're a f*cking dolt. If you couldn't see the sarcasm or satire in the review, you should give yourself a pat on the back for being so stupid. Just look at the other reviews the fan made. It's quite clear, QUITE EXPLICIT, that it's all a joke.Stop bitching about the avrilfan and start questioning why you were trying to sound civilized when it came to someone pulling your string."
1,much to love about Cobain's charming crudities and rawness,"A thoroughly rockin' album I have listened to over and over. But they severely lost credibility in my book when I found out ""Come As You Are"" ripped off Killing Joke's ""Eighties."" Ripping off other peoples' music is inexecusibly sleezy. ""Come As You Are"" was key to propelling Nirvana into the realm of fame and fortune and it was nothing but a lie. For shame! I'll still listen and love it though. Shame on me!"
4,its good music but way overrated,"The songs on this cd are good and some are great: come as you are, breed (for its pure rawness), and lithium alone make this cd worth buying. It gets boring after a while but the first time you hear it you can understand why some people think its great. The fact that Kurt Cobain is a junkie and an idiot, and that the music is simple (not bad), doesn't change the fact that its good. A good solid buy for anyone who is into music."
5,nevermind album is wicked,buy this album nirvana r a legend support them coz though kurt committed suicide they will live on
2,an important album....(if you disclude the grunge before it),"nevermind came out during a time of a musical wasteland...our ears were being filled with the trash still pouring over from the 80's, no wonder the album did so well..it was completely fresh at the time...the only problem i have is...i can find a ton of albums like it but better, what the album did for nirvana was put them on the spotlight..what it didnt do was show their true music, if you want nirvana pick up bleach or in utero..(these albums seem far less produced and much more real)...but as far as a good pop album goes nevermind is good"
4,This was a pretty good CD,"I really like Nirvana, and this was one of their best creations. I really liked ""smells like teen spirit."" I'm a big fan of nirvana type music. It was definetly worth buying."
2,"Not Impressed, Never was...","Ok, Im probably gonna get flamed here, but I dont care. I have never like Nirvana, nor will I ever like them. Kobain's death was a tragic loss, I cared about him as a fellow human being, but never a musician. What else can I say about that. I grew up in the 70's and 80's, during the singer/songwriter time, and in the 80's during the Punk, New Wave, Hairband time, so for me, when Nirvana came along with their NEO-PUNK anthems, I hated it all. They said that the GRUNGE MOVEMENT defined GEN X, well not for me. I rebuke that. Grunge killed everything else, which alot of you might think thats a good thing the Hairbands died, but I dont. The Gunge/NEO HIPPY scene of the early 90's made me sick to my stomach....I was born in 67, and my generation did not know a freaking thing about being hippies. Nirvana killed good music back then, as far as Im concerned, but hey, what is my opinion worth anyway. To each his own...."
5,Best Album of the past 20 years,"With the exception of certain bands such as Van Halen, U2, and REM, the 80's mainstream offered little decent music. Nevermind, which previewed in fall '91, is by far the best album of the 90's. Ten and Throwing Copper were certainly exceptional, but this is the king of the decade. There are a million analytical explanations as to why you should by this album, but I'll make it plain and simple. It's just fantastic. Even if you're not a rock fan, this is the album to listen to whenever you feel depressed or angry."
2,Smells like Teen Spirit.....,"Nirvana is by far one of the most over rated bands of all time. Really after hearing how great this album was by everyone and their mother I was expecting it to be as great as a Beatles album. Finally when I heard it I had to stop the thing before I threw my cd player out a window. Sure Nirvana sounds great but the lyrics are almost childish. If you want some cd for some mindless fun go ahead and get it. ""Smells like Teen Spirit"" though is not the best song on the album."
3,Overrated,"This was a great album! You know...back when I was an angry teenager who hated the world. But people grow up and realize that teenage perceptions of life isn't representative of life at all, but rather a bunch of self-indulgent BS.Of course, that doesn't make this a bad album. It's good and I have some liking for grunge, despite my revulsion of the musical forms it spawned. But it's terribly overrated, too. The playing isn't near where it should be, though I suppose that would have gone against the band's image. And because Kurt killed himself when they were on top, people always assume that they would have stayed on top...forever.Nah. I reserve that assumption for artists with considerably more talent.But if you like some variety, and want something less upbeat, this will do. Personally, I prefer Alice in Chains to fill that slot."
5,Best Album Ever,"Nirvana is easily one of the greatest rock bands of all time. Nevermind is by far their best and most heart- felt album. Smells Like Teen Spirit is probably one of the most famous songs of all time, rivaling other rock greats such as Layla, Stairway to Heaven, and Another Brick in the Wall. You cannot call yourself a fan of Nirvana, Kurt Cobain, or even rock if you do not own this album. Please buy this album if you are not a complete r tard."
1,tiresomely transgressive,"""Nevermind"" pinches liberally from Killing Joke, a band with more than a superficial interest in the art of music, the song in question being ""Eighties"".Kurt Cobain spends the album doing what I can only presume to be 'guitar-tuning'; he desperately tries to play an original riff that goes beyond 4 chords but his massive lack of sophistication and musical talent prevents him from doing so."
1,Terrible !,The worst album I ever purchased was 'Nevermind'. I had expected it to be excellent since Nirvana fans recommended it so highly. But I'm sorry to say that the cadaverous threesome have let me down. It is hard to listen to more than 3 songs at one go! I found the album to be monotonous & boring. The songs are very bad and the vocals are awful.
1,Really crummy CD with nothing to offer,"I first heard ""Nevermind"" in 1991, and thought I had heard it all before. In retrospect, I had. This Cd offers absolutely nothing new, and just recycles old seventies-bop-rock riffs. Also, the singer mutters intelligibly. Some people find that cool, but it just shows he can't actually sing. This is probably the most over-rated Cd of all time."
1,Pink Floyd is overrated as bad as Nirvana,"The solo in Come As You Are is just a repeat of the main bass riff. The whole song is just a repeat of that riff. Pink Floyd in their later days were more amazing than their earlier ones; Darkside of the Moon was just their most popular album, and Rolling Stone told you to like it so you followed suit. Darkside is also one of the most overrated albums of all time along with Never Mind. Everyone seems to own it, but why don't they all love it? Personally, The Division Bell is better. The title track is one of the most sweeping, beautiful songs I've ever heard. Maybe try picking that up instead of Never Mind. Or, maybe Never Mind te Bullocks intead of Nirvana's ripp-off of the Pistols."
5,Nevermind the haters.,"One of the greatest albums of all time. Remastered for better sound quaity. Just buy it, you know you want to! Its NIRVANA, the last 100% amazing band to come to the mainstream. Yes music has sucked for that long. Time to take a trip back in time to the days nirvana, alice in chains, pearl jam, stone temple pilots, smashing pumpkins and other 90's greats owned the airwaves! Here we are now, entertain us!"
3,Review of 2011 Remaster 2 disc set,"Obviously a classic/seminal album of the 90s. BUT, you really don't need anything other than the one disc version if you are a casual (or possibly even a slightly serious) fan. I love Nirvana, but found that the second disc really didn't add much to my thinking about this album (and the boombox versions are, um, challenging to listen to).The remaster sounds good to these ears. I could be wrong, but maybe they went a little easy on the compression, unlike other albums these days?"
1,"sibilance, poor sound","This review is about the audio quality of the LP, not about the content in any way. Although this release was hyped as being a ""definitive"" vinyl reissue, it suffers from sibilance in the vocals, clipping, and overall mediocre sound for a LP issue that implies audiophile quality sound. Anything BUT ""definitive"" vinyl reissue."
2,Shinning a light on the truth: Enough of the accolades... This album isn't all that great!,"Why is this album considered brillant?A: Because is sold 10 million copies in the U.S., and 26 million copies worldwide; 36,000,000 total. The album promoted the Grunge movement in Seattle... It features great melodies, because Kurt Cobain placed music before lyrics. It is the best selling Alternative Rock album... Is that it? I think so...Out of all honesty, why does an album like this become considered the 17th greatest album of all time (check: 500 Greatest albums of all time by Rolling Stone)? It's sad that albums like this acquire, so much attention. Beggars Banquet isn't as good as this album??? OK Computer? The Dead Side of the Moon???A candid review from a Radiohead/Pink Floyd listener.Would you say I'm too harsh musicially? If so, would concur with Pitchfork Media,""Anyone who hates this record today is just trying to be cool, and needs to be trying harder."""
3,Start of depressing rock,"I dont like Nirvana.Just wanted to get that out of the way, now ill continue with my review. Nevermind changed rock music when it was released. It took the glam and excess out of rock and made it depressing and suicidal. I cant argue that this is not a ""Great"" album, because any album that can change what is considered ""Rock"" has to be important. My argument with Nirvana, and grunge, Is it takes the fun out of the music. Kirt Cobain was so obsessed with not being popular and mainstreem, he killed himself. Why? He was singing the music he liked, and killed himself because others liked it. That has to be one of the worst reasons ive ever heard to kill yourself.In closing, ill say this. If you like grunge, this is Utopia. This is the album that made grunge popular. Its just not my style of music."
2,This Album is very overrated,"This album is very overrated. Kurt Cobain was druggie with no musical talent and it shows on Nevermind. Smells like Teen Spirit is a very boring song and is only entertaining the first few times you listin to it(same with the rest of the songs). I don't understand why Nirvana was and is, so popular. If you want some good grunge then you should listin to Alice In Chains, Pearl Jam, or Screaming Trees."
3,"Good Innovative Album, But Tragically Overrated","Okay, let's bring a bit of reason to the discussion. This isn't the greatest album of all-time. It isn't the most important rock album ever, nor is it even the best grungle album of all-time. There is little musicianship at all to this....just a bunch of heroin-inspired poetry set to one riff songs.Now with that said, I must say that this is an overall good record. The lyrics express true emotion and feeling, while the riffs (even if there are only one in each song) are catchy. Cobain was a very innovative musician and quite a few people have tried to imitate his sound.For the good music, good lyrics, innovation, and the fact that this album killed off glam rock and hair bands, I give it three stars."
3,remaster sucks,There is still hisses and crap on Something in the Way and there is a full blown guitar error 1.07 in Polly - sucks hard. But the tunes are cool.
3,Decent,"hey,stop generalizing and lumping nirvana in with the horrible bands of todaystop writing reviews just to list other bands you think are better than nirvana(they aren't anyways)oh, in utero is better than nevermind anywayaside from SLTS i dont listen to any of the songs on this CD(i prefer the unplugged version of come as you are)smells like teen spirit is one of the greatest rocks songs ever written"
5,Kurt Cobain-Modern day Elvis,"This is by far their best CD and most memorable! every song on here is amazing and speaks so true and so many people can actually relate to the lyrics Kurt Cobain wrote down and turned into instant classics. This is the best CD from Nirvana, and probably one of the top 20 best CDs of all time! Nirvana is probably one of the top 5 best bands of all time! R.I.P. Kurt Cobain!"
4,Don't start your Nirvana collection with this.,"Please people, I see way too many young kids these days, all born around Kobain's death that just buy this album. This is not, and never will be Nirvana's best album. If you want to hear Nirvana with their best sound, go with the 1989 sub-pop release, ""Bleach."" After you listen to Bleach some 300 times, then you can purchase Nevermind. All us older folk did that before Nevermind even came out. You haven't heard Nirvana, until you've rocked out to Bleach. And remember kids, you can never dust off your flannel shirt. Oh, and by the way, in all technicality this was never grunge, Bleach was. Screaming trees, Mother Love Bone, Early Pearl Jam, and Mudhoney are some grunge examples. Go check 'em out.Bleach"
5,Best ever cd that Nirvana made,I don't know about anyone else but I think it was their best album it was completely amazing I listen to it everyday but have a little trouble learning the lyrics is there anyone out there that has got them and I can borrow them
4,Music for the mainstream,"Nirvana brought the PIXIES sound to the mainstream listening public. And for this accomplishment alone, this cd is worthy of 4 stars."
4,Good...but....,"This album is mediocre in my opinion. Shure it got alot of media attention but honstly if you want a good cd from nirvana go get Bleach(about a girl is a great song though Chad Channings drumming needs alot of work, no competiton with Grohl). Its there 1st and my favorate. This Cd has some good songs such as Lithium but really I dont think it deserves the 5 most of you give it. I also dont agree with you anit-nirvana freaks who love that craaazy rap along with your head metal. But what ever floats your boat I guess. Over all id say this is a decent cd and by far better than anything Pearl Jam can come out with..."
2,Smells Like Someone Skipped His Guitar Lessons,"Actually 2 1/2 stars . Drain is pretty good , so is the song Polly . Lounge act is awesome . Most of this album is a power pop album - not all that much different then the hair band nightmare it vanquished . The differences being Cobain is a brooder , hence the silly lyrics .... the other difference - the musicianship is mediocre ( and that's being kind ) .The best guitar player in the band is behind the drum kit ... go figure . This is at the core of Nirvanas legacy . They made it acceptable ..and fashionable to be mediocre. The music industry finds itself in a bit of a quandry these days . Why ? Because no one knows how to play beyond the beginner level . Why ? Because the critics can't cope with anything too complex . With the level of undesereved hype and praise associated with this album you can expect more of the same and untill things change , the "" genius "" of Kurt Cobain will linger ...like one of his brooding songs ."
3,I'm one of those Incesticidal fans,"As glossed-up as it may be, Nevermind isn't one of my favorite Nirvana albums. There's nothing wrong with it, though. I just don't like how there aren't any textured walls of layered sound or bizarro experimentation on this album. I'm more of an Incesticidal fan, if that makes any sense. I love Nirvana's early material best, but In Utero suits me just as well. Be that as it may, my favorite songs on here are ""Lithium"", ""Breed"", ""Territorial Pissings""... and I just can't help myself... ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"". Yeah, you know you like it too. Even a seasoned Nirvana fan like myself cannot lie about that one. BUT, I'll take ""Hairspray Queen"" and ""Big Long Now"" over ""Teen Spirit"" anyday. If you must get a Nirvana album, start with Incesticide; it features the band's accessible songs along with their earlier rough, quirky ones."
5,*THIS* is music :),"Smells like teen spirit is definitely a nice way to start off any album, and then to be followed by a complete bombardment of great songs such as Breed, Lithium, Come as You are.. (i could list the whole CD :) makes it a definite CD to add to one's collection. However, I wasn't too enthused about Polly and Something in the Way.. although this is purely personal preference. The actual ordering of the songs in this CD is well done, I like having the ""angry"" territorial pissings following the ""soft"" Polly.. Overall, this is definitely Nirvana's *best* CD (and besides, its got a pretty funky cover ;)"
5,"no matter what anyone says, Nirvana owns....","Who compares Nirvana to Metallica?!?! Your an idiot! Nirvana and Metallica are completley different! It's stupid to compare bands because you can't prove their better. It's an opinion.Besides, Nirvana sold millions more than Metallica, so ha!"
5,Naked Babies?,"Kurt Cobain truly put it all into this album. The selection of genres create a fantastic piece of musical history. From the severe grunginess (I think that's a word) of Smells Like Teen Spirit, to the slow passion revealed in Polly, this album is great. However, as Kurt used to say, you can't be a true fan if you think these are the only Nirvana songs. You have to discover their hidden meanings, and enjoy them for that. TOTAL NIRVANA!"
3,This album is okay,Thi slabum has a few good songs on it Lithium andSmells Like Teen Spirit. But this is not the best album of the last decade. There were so many better albums that came out during the 90's for instance Superunkown by Soundgarden and Dirt by Alice In Chains.
1,hurt my ears,"this nirvana set was a super let down, the boombox tracks are garbage, cool for a one time listen, other than that though, well not so much. the vig mixes were a let down as well, not hard to tell why they had it remixed before releasing it, and the remaster of the original actually hurt my ears, quailty control got away form somebody on this one. And the blu ray was out of snyc, i feel like i wasted over two hundred bucks on the whole set, bummer."
3,got me into rock,"very=punk influenced songs. If ur into punk u should definitly get this. guitar fanatics should stay away. cobain cant really sing but he can scream in tune. nothin but power chords, and solos mimicking the vocal parts. Sad that cobain killed himself, but i don't think ne 1 would disagree with the fact that they are the most overrated band of all time. high point in this album is the drumming. i would reccomend Alice in Chains' facelift as an alternate album. its very melodic and rocks MUCH MUCH harder"
2,GET TEN FROM PEARL JAM INSTEAD,THIS OVERRATED CD HAS ONLY TWO LISTENABLE SONGS IN SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT AND LITHIUM SO I AM GIVING THIS ONLY TWO STARS THE OTHER SONGS ARE AWFUL.AVOID THIS CD AND GET PEARL JAM'S DEBUT CD TEN AND STONE TEMPLE PILOTS CORE INSTEAD AS BOTH THESE BANDS WERE FAR MORE TALENTED THAN NIRVANA AND ARE STILL ACTIVE AND STILL MAKING GREAT MUSIC EVEN NOW.
5,This is their best CD ever.,This CD expresse all of their ideas of music. The best song on this album is definately Lounge Act.
3,sigh . . . well . . .,"This is a good album. Most of the songs are good. But if you really like Nirvana (which I actually don't), then you will know that this CD was so enhanced and poppified when it came out that it sounded nothing like they really do. It is a facade, and Kurt Cobain has said that he hates this album. It has good songs, but it is very overrated for what it is."
3,uhhh...,"Sure, this album can be entertaining, but after a few weeks it becomes repetetive. Cobain's guitar parts are incredibly similiar in every song as well as the drum beat and the lame lyrics. I totally disagree with some of the reviews here stating that this album is the greatest of the 90's. If you want to hear Seattle rock at it's finest listen to Pearl Jam or Soundgarden or something, at least those bands are more creative and can do some decent solos on the guitar! I don't want to even start with my complaints on Cobain's repetetive criticism of Pearl Jam's music. They outdo this garage band easily! In conclusion, this album is quite a pleasure to listen to, but you soon realize that you're listening to the same simple guitar chords in different orders."
5,the best cd ever,nirvana rocks your cd is so awesome if you guys were still together you would still be awesome your cd is awesome your cd is awesome
3,"NIRVANA ROCKS, but if u want real Nirvana, get another album","I cannot say anything negative about this album other then its over produced. The best albums are In Utero and Incesticide, any true, true nirvana fan would tell u that. Thank you."
5,wunderkirk can drink napalm,"I will listen to and/or idiolize whoever I please, pal. Nirvana is one of my favorite bands, and the fact that they were only acknowledged by the mainsream for three short years (1991-1994) and still considered one of the greatest bands of all time is an inevitable fact that deserves EVERYONE'S respect. And you, my fellow mortal, are no exception.With that out of the way, here are my ratings for each track:1. Smells Like Teen Spirit 10/102. In Bloom 10/103. Come As You Are 10/104. Breed 8.5/105. Lithium 9/106. Polly 10/107. Territorial Pissings 9/108. Drain You 10/109. Lounge Act 9/1010. Stay Away 8/1011. On A Plain 10/1012. Something In The Way 10/10This album may not appeal to ""true metal"" fans, but then again, I don't consider Warrant, Poison, Whitesnake, and Motley Crue to be true metal. I consider Megadeth, Testiment and Slayer real metal bands. But these are just my own opinions and I will not force it on to you people."
3,PUNK ROCK FOR THE MASSES,"Nirvana's ""Nevermind"" album ushered in the acceptance of punk rock in the mainstream. For many, this was the second coming. But was Kurt Cobain really all that? Unfortunately, what people fail to realize is that this style of music wasn't anything new in the 90's. In fact, I remember listening to bands similar to Nirvana in the early 80's. This included punk bands like Minor Threat, Die Kreuzen, The Germs, The Adolescents, Social Distortion, Black Flag, The Dead Kennedys and the Circle Jerks. None of these groups achieved superstardom like Nirvana. However, they were all just as interesting. For Kurt Cobain and the members of Nirvana, although very talented, being in the right place at the right time was certainly a key to their success."
3,The beginning of the end!,"When ""Teen Spirit"" hit the airways it was a high voltage jolt of youthful energy. However, it was 1991 the year music died. While I actually liked this record I can't accept the ""icon of gen x"" tag that Kobain has been dubbed. The music machine of labels suddenly wouldn't sign a band that didn't have a grunge sound. All that was allowed to survive and record were rap acts, boy bands and solo female teen pop idols. As important as the media says this record was its influence leads me to believe it would be better if it was never released."
2,Oh Boy...,"Thank God Grunge Is Dead. Some say Grunge lead to the death of 80's Metal; I say 80's Metal may have died, but surely lasted much longer than Grunge, and, is making a slight comeback! Regardless, Kirk Cobain was a loser - he was doomed from the start. Kirk, a social inept with a drug problem, was one lucky guy who happened to be in the right place at the right time. His likeness should serve as a warning for what drugs do to a person - more so, to the poor daughter he left behind."
5,Smells like buff audio,"Nirvana kicks serious audio. i cant believe i used to not like them! Nevermind is pure platinum stuff. It destroys all other comparable CD's. Its smash hits like Smells Like Teen Spirit, In Bloom, Lithium, and Come As You Are rule! NEVERMIND the competition, Nevermind kills!"
5,One of my favorite CDs,"What can I say but that you have to listen to this as loud as you can. I think Cobain was a musical genius and that can't feed through unless you turn it up and drown yourself in the music. Music like Nirvana's is good beacuse it has a message. A lot more to say than your average rap song whose most important message might be that hot women shakin their bootays is good. Well no shiz! What else u got to say? Once again, if you are debating whether to buy this or not. There's nothing to think about. It's the type of CD that you'll want to listen through every song. Play it again and again. And damn it turn it up. Yes folks this is what you do when you are bored on a hot summer day. Oh and any disagreement with this opinion should be taken up with amazon.com since they so kindly mentioned that ""All submitted reviews become the sole property of Amazon.com"". Yadda!"
1,"I hate this band, I hate this CD","Please, don't waste your time with this album. It is full of self-pity and misery. All Kurt Cobain ever did is feel sorry for himself, and then he killed himself because he ""couldn't handle fame"". Whatever. Why do people respect this guy???"
1,"terrible, worthless","I can't figure out what so many people see in this. Nirvana, in my opinion, was a horrible band with a lead singer who couldn't sing, and Nevermind is the absolute worst of their four major CDs. I see nothing even remotely appealing in it."
2,Nothing Special,"This is probably the best album Nirvana has ever made and it has only one great song in it. Two-stars for only the sake of ""Smells like.."" Just check out the Patti Smith version. Much better then Nirvana !"
2,Another Overplayed Band,"nirvana is another overplayed band. I hear them on every radio station in the world and they only play 2 albums, this and InUtero. Plus I'm glad Kurt Cobain died because he didn't ever makegood music. He was always out of control the first time I heardthis album, and this and Use Your Illusion CDs from Guns N' Rosesruined rock music. This album has a few good songs like SmellsLike Teen Spirit, and Come As You Are. I think the thing withradios is that radios need to stop playing Nirvana 7 days a week.Because Nirvana sucks!!!! OVERRATED TOO. Just like AC/DC.Buy something from Dire Straits."
1,whoopie doo,"i firmly beleive that the only reason peopel like this band is because they were the first to do it. because it is talentless, it really is. the guy knew 3 chords, sang like a dying chicken, and wrote stupid, pity lyrics about being dumb and having no friends. if a band like this came out now, no one would care, if anything they'd laugh at it."
1,And WHY did i buy this CD?,"i have to wholeheartedly agree with those who question the 5-star ratings for this CD. This cd went in and out of the charts like the bullet that permeated Kurt Cobain's brain. Forgotten, collecting dust of the shelves of countless 20-somethings who bought it (or begged mom to buy it for them).The only lasting legacy that Curt Cobain has left on me is his annoying, disease-ridden ex-wife. God, how i WISH she'd join him!This is mindless, rythymless crap. A one hit wonder and i still wonder why."
1,"Overrated, MTV supported pop.","I don't see what others see in this album. The lyrics don't make any sense all all. The drumming isn't all that hot. The guitar work is ridiculously simple and so is the drumming. There is one positive outcome and one negative associated with the birth of Nirvana. The positive outcome is that with this album, Nirvana managed to end the popularity of glam rock which from day one blinded people as to what authentic metal sounded like. The negative outcome is that with this album, Nirvana popularized the entire genre of grunge which consists mostly of vocalists complaining about how awful their ""Beautiful people having a lovely time"" lifestyle is. Whiny, narcissistic, self-indulgent people don't impress me. I agree with the other one star reviewers. The death of Kurt Cobain only helped compound the praise of this band and especially this album."
1,KURT COBAIN = THE AVRIL LAVIGNE OF 10 YEARS AGO,"If Avril Lavigne was a man & was alive 10 years ago, she wouldve been Kurt Cobain& no, that certainly isnt a compliment to avril eitherWhat a joke @ nirvana & nirvana fans"
5,This Album Changed My Life,"The Day / or should I say the Minute after I heard: Smells Like Teen Spirit , I got in the car want to record store and bought the album Nevermind , then drove around till I found Bleach and got it too . Stood out side the record store ( rain , snow , hell ) waiting for it to open the day they release a new LP/CD .I just wish they would of cut 1,001 albums and it still would'nt of been enuff for me . Kirt RIP buddy, I fell your pain still even today 7/14/2005."
1,Completely Overrated!,"This CD sux! I cant believe that Nirvana got number one song of the 90's when they werent even together for half of them! ""smells like teen spirit"" is supposed to be this original song that amazed and inspired people, well it is exactly like ANY pearl jam song, and yea i know pearl jam's debut album came after, but it came out right before nevermind came out and they sound exactly alike, face it u freaks Nirvana is just another grunge band. If Kurt Cobain hadnt of commited suicide he would be a nobody right now! the only reason he is remembered is because he is a loser who killed himself! he is just an ordinary man who has no talent, just because kurt cobain can scream and whine into a microphone doesnt make him special! I gave this CD one star simply because there is no option for 0 stars! complete and total disappointment!"
1,R-U-B-B-I-S-H,Nevermind is most definately the worst album i have ever heard.This awful group should have been canned for making such a terrible album.KURT COBAIN-ROT IN PEACE.
1,wow......this sucks,"this **** isnt even worthy of a review.. they inspired some of the worst bands in rock and roll history...kurt cobain was just no talent heroin user, . NO stars but i have to give it one for inpiring someone, thats all nirvana did. There are so may GREAT bands to represent the 1990's check out Oasis-(Whats the story?) Morning Glory and RADIOHEAD- Ok Computer...Nirvana had NO TALENT.. they were just in the right place in the right time"
5,A must have.....,"This is probably the best album i've ever heard, and this album is what got me turned on to the group. I've always been a sucker for great melodies with a hard shock-rock twist along with well written kyrics, and this album MORE than delivers. I've since looked into Nirvana's other albums and they too are amazing. But i'd have to say this is my favorite. If you liked this ablum you might like ten by pearl jam."
2,Full of noise,"Nevermind is full of noise, screaming and talentless guitar playing. It isn't worth your time or money. Kurt Cobain's depressing lyrics and rackety guitar playing gives you a headache after the very first song. If you like rackety, depressing music, this album is for you; but if not, I suggest you stay away. Kurt's lead guitar for songs like ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" ""Lithium"" and ""Come As You Are"" are often the first songs people learn on the guitar. That is how easy and talentless they are. I didn't enjoy this album, but others may."
1,Nirvana paved the path for the current crap on MTV,"Nirvana was a load of bullsh*t. So was Grunge: It was just an excuse to sound like crap. Nirvana, along with their other so-called ""Alternative"" brethren were Arena Rockers; the only difference between them and Bon Jovi was that Nirvana never washed their hair. Kurt Cobain was in such denial about everything. He refused to admit he was an unfit junkie parent, and he also refused to admit he was mainstream. Cobain never had any message; he just randomly mumbled words slurred together. Fans just wish the lyrics could pertained to their own lives.Here are some better, equally-polished albums from bands that just as good live as they are in the studio (unlike Nirvana)...Smashing Pumpkins: Mellon Collie & the Infinite SadnessThe Offspring: SmashGreen Day Nimrod"
1,Boring,"Touted by MTV as being the leaders of the american version of punk. MTV? Punk? There must be some sort of contradiction there. Anyway I got this CD listened to it once and never listened to it again. Must be the most boring CD I own and I own a few. If you think Nirvana's music is energetic then try listening to Nick Cave's ""Stagger Lee"" and then you'll understand what true rock music is but then again maybe you won't."
1,THE ULTIMATE PHONY TEENY BOPPER ALBUM,"Do you enjoy GOod charlotte, blink 182? do you love MTV? & Avril Lavigne? do you shop at Hot Topic? do you have rich parents? do you WISH you had problems in your life, but dont, because you only want the attention?THEN THIS IS THE ALBUM FOR YOU!!"
3,"Good, yes. Over rated, Yes!","Okay, we all heard how ground breaking and important this album was. We all liked to hear ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" when it came over the radio back in 91 and 92. Since then, people (including musicians) can't stop talkin about this freakin album. I don't know, but it may be possible that people automatically think of Cobain as a legend just due to the fact he killed himself. In all reality, this is just a normal rock album. Let's not over do it, people!"
4,Did not invent or popularize grunge but decent.,"Nirvana is a bit overrated and they did not popularize grunge. Alice in chains's Facelift did. But this album is a good one though. It's got In Bloom, come as u r, On s plain, and the way bloated smells like teen spirit. The album is good but I would say the best grunge band would Alice in chains and the best grunge album would their breakthrough Dirt. Alice in chains is just heavier, moodyer, and more talented. C'mon, Jerry cantrell is way better than Cobain in guitar playing. Otherwise this is a good album but I would say Dirt is a way better album. You should get it too and compair the two."
5,"Nevermind the rest, This is still the best!","Every once in a while, a really great album comes along and changes your life. I remember this year well and I still believe this is the greatest album of all time. Ok so Kurt Cobain wasn't the greatest guitar player ever and he couldn't really sing. But in my opinion that is not what makes a truly great album anyway. He wrote great songs, that are catchy, emotional and will stay in your head for a long long time.Credit must go to producer Butch Vig for bringing out the best in Nirvana. In my opinion Nirvana are the most influencial band since the Beatles, not necessarily the best, but they left a lasting impression on me. I still listen to this album today and love it as much as the day I bought it all those years ago. I just can't wait to see the look on my kids faces when I play it to them for the first time."
4,oh come on,"this is a good album. but concerning grunge, a term in which i don't believe in, this is wayyyyyyyyy below anything Alice in Chians or Pearl Jam have ever done. It's great though from the begining till the end. i recommend this. in a way the music and the lyrics are good."
1,nirvana sucks!,"nevermind is amongst the most overrated and lousiest rock albums of all time.awful songs like smells like teen spirit and polly reek!.there are absolutely no guitar solos in this album.this is just noise.THIS IS ONE ALBUM WHICH EVERY ROCK FAN SHOULD AVOID.get any album from LED ZEPPELIN,BLACK SABBATH or DEEP PURPLE instead."
1,'Nevermind' buying this trash.,"This album is just the epitome of bad, but yet worshipped music. There is really no other way to put it other than the music is just awful. The lyrics are awful, their sound is nerve racking, and I've heard dying cats who can sing better than Kurt Cobain. I suppose it's only fair to blame the herion. Only something like herion could drive a person to create such atrocious noise. If you want to hear some good 90's music, buy Alice in Chains greatest hits."
1,Nevermind um yeah Nevermind,"The Only thing In my opinion Nirvana did for music, Was make it ok to be half-ass. The album is borderline boring, it is depressing, and the songs are bland. If you want to listen to music that really sets the Standards for what talent is, Listen to Nightwish, or Evanescence. Grundge indeed."
1,NIRVANA : The band that saved me,I was on a desolate train going through Seattle on a rainy morning. I was all depressed. I was surviving my my wits. I had nobody to turn to for help out of my downward spiral. My only friends were an iced Starbuck's double mocha brownie fudge frappacino and this NIRVANA Nevermind CD I had in my $60 discman by mum packed for me an hour before. I wanted to get away-- from family-- from middle school-- from societal rules. NIRVANA was my ticket (along with my train ticket) A dull haze of grey washed over my mind as I sat alone holding onto the trail pole. I think it was pure bliss... the bliss of hearing KURDT. I drifted away. I was a drifter. Drifting aimlessly in the debacle we call the universe. Adrift in a sea of Seattle grey. My eyes were adrift. Eyes Adrift. Perfect... NIRVANA.
1,Kurt idolizing a Straight Edge legend! How funny is that?!,"Nirvana doesn't sound like Black Flag. Kurt was too doped up on poppies when he wrote the Sub Pop bio of his band where he says Nirvana sounded like the Bay City Rollers and Black Flag. Henry Rollins specifically said so. He also stated he doesn't want to be associated with such a ""classic"" Grunge group who abused drugs like the band members of Nirvana did. I find it funny and insanely hypocritical that a junkie like Kurt Cobain idolozed a STRAIGHT EDGE musician such as Rollins. Rollins even said that someone who poisons their body with drugs and alcohol deserves the damage they do to themselves.Go buy a Black Flag's DAMAGED instead of Nevermind's Pop bullsh*t"
1,Brilliant...,"Something tells me that Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, the loathsome Nirvana, and the rest of the genre could have achieved as much musicality if they were playing chainsaws and jackhammers as opposed to musical instruments. Do you self deluded ""slackers"" really think grunge was about honesty and passion? It was about finding a new way of separating a bunch of gullable, immature fools from their money. Mission accomplished.""Mosh on dudes! Duh!"""
1,"Nevermind is decent, but not anything special","There has been such great music after Nirvana that ""Alternative"" albums that everyone owns (like Nevermind) are obsolete. They just don't matter anymore. I don't see why Kurt did himself in because of his fans and the way music was headed. He ended his life for no reason. He had it so good, but now he isn't even here to defend the fact that he wasn't the Rock God everyone here says he was. Nevermind was good, but it wasn't special. You can thank Rolling Stone (corporate finks) for all this constant overpraise of Nirvana, but it's even worse that most here believe it. Here's a novel idea: Try thinking for yourselves insted of thinking what Rolling Stone tells you Kurt supposedly said to think."
4,Awsome album!!!,"I wouldent say this is the best of nirvanas work i personally love incesticide and bleach way better the only reason why i like this and i would recommend it is because of all the other songs like drain you,lithium,somthing in the way, because i dont think smells like teen spirit is all that great of a song its ok but if u expect the whole album to sounds like teen spirit then just buy the single! but all in all its great album a little overated but thats ok!"
4,Kurt & the Boys Do Good...,"The release of 'Nevermind's' single, 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' catapolted Nirvana into a new group of new-wavers - the Seattle pop/grunge genre. Nevermind is highly rated as Nirvana's greatest effort, however, although it is a brilliant offering, Insecticide, Bleach and In Utero should also be considered amongst some of the best albums to have been released in the past two decades. With the unfortunate loss of Cobain, I think the hype that was generated from his passing made Nevermind an even more sought after album than it already was. Check out 'Something In The Way', 'Polly' and my favourite track, 'Lithium'."
5,Nirvana will never be old,I love Nirvana. This CD has to be one of the best CDs of all time. I listen to this CD all the time. It inspires me in my everyday life. Kurt Cobain has left a huge impact in the world of music and will never be forgotten.
4,Damn nifty.,"A great album, full of emotional and well writen, forthright songs. Their guitar rifts are catching and their tunes are addictive. I never actually imagined myself listening to Nirvana, but I was very surprised when I popped the CD in my player. They're great. The song I like and can probably relate to most is ""Come As You Are."" Overall a great album."
4,Some ALL TIME classics!!!!,"Nirvana was one of my favorite bands when i was a teenager, and Nevermind got ALL TIME classics like Smells like teen spirit, Come as you are and Polly...By the time nirvana became a Huge band, there's many other bands that are WAY WAY WAY better, like Alice in Chains, Faith No More, Pantera and Soundgarden...but nevermind got some real classics, and deserves its space on the all time classic albuns..."
3,Stop judging this band on influence,"And start judging them by their music. Which, with the exception of a few gems, is quite ordinary. Smells Like Teen Spirit is purely legendary and one of the great songs of all time. Come as You are is another good one and the album finishes of with Something In the Way, a real good, well written song. Other than that the album is pretty regular, repetitive and dull. Probably the least talented of the big four grunge bands, which isn't really a slam, because all of those bands are excellent."
5,Nothing at all can compare to Nirvana,"I, frankly, find Nirvana amazing. Although I am not a Gen X-er (and I really wish I was older so that I could remember 1991!), I can say that Nirvana revolutionized the world of music. There was no music quite like Nirvana's and there never will be. When Kurt Cobain sings, you can hear his pain, passion, and anger. Also, his lyrics are poignant and thought provoking. They are full of complex messages and political and social commentary, full of contradictions Kurt was easily the best songwriter that ever lived. Whoever says the lyrics are whiny or some crap like that is seriously ill.There are so many things about Nirvana to praise, but I could not fit them in one review. Words just can't describe how great Nirvana is. And when Kurt Cobain died, a generation died, the music died, and a little bit of everyone died. He was a legend.RIP Kurt-Olivia, 14"
5,Nirvana.,"Thats what this is.We all know this band and this album. The most famed album of all time, certainly the 90s. Even the cover tells a story. Its what made Nirvana and to an extent what broke Nirvana. It has Kurt Cobain songs written when they were hoping for fame and fortune. And you cant blame him, the guy was evicted from his flat on the day it was released!The best introduction to the band, one of the best albums you will ever own. Every song a classic."
3,This album is okay,This album has a few good songs on it Lithium andSmells Like Teen Spirit. But this is not the best album of the last decade. There were so many better albums that came out during the 90's for instance Superunkown by Soundgarden and Dirt by Alice In Chains.
5,So what if it's overrated?,"Yes, Nevermind is a very overrated album, and I don't think it's Nirvana's best album either. In Utero is my favorite Nirvana album.But, nevertheless, Nevermind is an enjoyable album. There's lots of cool songs that will stay in your head for weeks (Smells Like Teen Spirit, Breed). People give this album 1 star because it's ""overrated"". Just because it's overrated doesn't mean it sucks, this album has some VERY good moments on it. So what if it ""isn't really Nirvana"", that doesn't mean it sucks either, it means that Kurt and his band was exploring new territory.If you're interested in Nirvana, this should be your first album by them. Although In Utero is an overall better album (IMO) it's a lot harder to get into.This was Nirvana's ""breakthrough"" album for a reason, pick it up."
3,Nirvana`s best album.,"Nevermind.This album is awesome. Nirvana expresses the ideas of the members and can combine the ideas with good music. The song ""come as you are"" is one of the best songs of this album. This album represents the maturity of Nirvana with their music. A bad aspect of this album is that the majority of the songs have the same format, but all are good for the ideas and the combined rhythm."
5,The most perfect rock album,"Nirvana's Nevermind is as much a classic album as Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon and The Eagles' Hotel California. Fusing a loud, searing punk roar with catchy pop melodies, Nevermind made Nirvana a household name. From the breakthrough hit ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" to the eerie ""Something In The Way"", this album is a sheer delight. ""In Bloom"" epitomizes their sound the best, with catchy sing-song verses juxtaposed with a raging, monolithic, deafening chorus. Another reason for the success of Nevermind was Kurt Cobain's haunting narratives of teenage insecurity. Even today, they still touch upon something deep within the soul. And let us not forget the fierce rythym section of Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic. In conclusion, the band's success was well deserved and Cobain was a musical genius taken from us much too soon."
2,"Taking the ""alternative"" out of alternative rock.","I'm going to start saying that i'm reviewing a FLAC rip of the CD album. The vinyl might sound better, but I doubt it. The music fails to take you in and out of highs and lows that originally gave the ""alternative"" to alternative rock. A listen to the solo of In Bloom makes it seem as if Cobain wasn't playing the way he used to, the music stays on the same plain throughout the album. The original greatness of the album was dumbed down to plastic wrap this masterpiece into something sellable and displaceable. Stay with the 1991 version."
4,Probably the most overrated record ever,"Don't get me wrong; this is a good record, but i don't feel it's the ultimate rock record. First 5 songs are great and brought fresh air to hard rock scene but the rest of it it's not as good."
3,Respect it more for what it did rather than what it is,"Yes, this album kicked off the '90s. Yes, it changed the face of mainstream rock. Yes, it saved us from hair metal and brought us back someplace further down to earth (whether it was a good place or bad place all depends on one's taste).But historical importance aside, this is basically Nirvana with bells and whistles. Studio gloss may have served them well as far as making them household names of epic proportions and, again, presenting something new to popular music, but as far as giving them any real artistic credibility or showcasing their raw (emphasis on RAW) punk roots, it accomplishes very little, in my opinion. Punk and polish do not mix.A wholly decent, enjoyable album regardless, but if I want to hear the true essence of Kurt and the boys, I just pop in any of their other releases."
2,Thanks Nirvana,"I can't beleive people still rant and rave about this thing being the ultimate in modern rock. Get over it folks, it's mediocre at best. Go listen to Appetite for Destruction and stop taking yourselves so damn seriously. ""But Nirvana killed the hairbands!"" so what? They also opened the floodgates for a whole stack of crummy mid 90s bands who have been thankfully long forgotten."
2,"I'm not a kid, but please listen:",People should stop spending their time tying bands into a certain genre and just listen.
1,nothign new,"i know im not gonna say anything that hasnt been said before but i need to do this...nirvana is without a doubt the most overhyped and mindlessly followed band ever. its gotten to the point where if you dislike nirvana people think you have mental problems. i, being a musician enjoy music that incorporates new ideas, i am by no means saying simplicity is bad but using the same chord progression in every song is just being lazy and obnoxious. boycott nirvana"
1,Pearl Jam ~> Crapvana,Nirvana is awful. Kurt Cobain isnt even from seattle although he wishes he was. Everyone with at least half a brain knows that Nirvana doesnt have one good album. They became a completely sappy band. They deteriotrated to nonsense. They arent even a rock band anymore. Kurt belonged in the same category as those pop fools from american idol. Cobain wasnt half the songwriter Eddie is & was. If kurt were alive today he'd laugh his fans nowadays.
1,NIRVANA COULDNT EVEN COMPETE WITH PEARL JAM ALIVE,"You do all realize that when Nirvana was around, Pearl Jam was literally about 3 times bigger than them... right? even though Nirvana were on MTV more, right?Pearl Jam sold more albums, they had a bigger fanbase, were more talked about... all until, both, PJ stepped away from the media, & kurt diedTHAT, ... THAT, is the ONLY reason Nirvana started to become as big as Pearl JamPearl Jam = the biggest, most honest, most diverse, amazing band of the 90s"
2,VERY overrated.....,"THIS is the best album of the 90s? Sure, it was incredibly succesful and transformed the music scene.....but.....I have to let you know that the Backsreet Boys' debut also did this, and so did Follow the Leader. Are either one of these albums actually GOOD? I do have to admit that our friend from Aberdeen was able to write clever lyrics and occasionly good (enough) music, but he wasn't that great of a musician. (Although I love his voice.)If you want ""grunge"" that is at all good, try Nirvana's first album, Bleach, or any Alice In Chains albums, not to mention Soundgarden."
1,"Nenhuma estrela,na verdade.","Com certeza uma das piores coisas que já foram feitas na história da música.Aqui só há barulho,nenhuma cano.Infelizmente,quase ninguém concorda comigo.Voc já no teve a sensao que todo mundo é coprófago,menos voc próprio?"
1,Pure rubbish.,"Wow! Where do I start? The lyrics read like a fourteen year old girl's diary...a sad litany of immature, poorly developed, and cliched gripes. And the music has all of the sophistication of a circus monkey banging on a garbage can lid. The sad fact of rock's demise can be seen clearly in this trite, hilarious load of self-absorbed trash...a garbled mess oftentimes described as rock's rebirth. Whereas rock and roll will never return to the self-aware and relevant heights it reached in the late 1960's, the younger generation deserves more than this. With it's simple-minded approach and droning lack of creativity and diversity, let's hope grunge rock is gone for good...forever relegated to that growing dust heap of contrived, naive, and uninspiring CRAP!!!"
1,One song.........the rest stinks bad,"I know a few people who think this is one of the greatest albums ever produced. I bought it right after hearing ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and was salivating as I put it into the CD player. I heard that song and then a whole lot of junk. I gave it away to someone else the next day and he in turn gave it away too. What a disappointment! This album also ended rock music and spawned bands who were more concerned about some sort of image than the music they made."
1,"why its bad, seriously...","1.) overproduced. and you fans call yourselves listeners of ""important"" music. nothing sounds human on this record, heavily edited with fix-your-singing software, no different than Britney Spears.2.) this is why cobain killed himself. All he wanted to do was make honest music, like all punks. The massive pop candy effent drove him to drugs, courtney love, and suicide.3.) first album was way better. in fact, a classic punk album. this is what you should be listening to instead.4.) gross cover. I HATE naked babies.5.) most of all, try listening to some of cobain's influences like black flag, bowie, and the beatles instead. all of those artists music was way better than any of cobain's output."
1,Poem for a Poet,"Kurt Cobain was a great poet, so I decided to write my review as a poem. Also, I'm not going to give stars because I don't think Kurt made music to get stars on Amazon, at least, not the Kurt I knew.KURT COBAIN(Written on the 26th of August 2001, in the early hours of the morning after listening to every single Nirvana album and getting high and then low.)kurt cobainWhat kind of namewas thatfor a man with a brain?Was this the reasonit drove him insaneor was it heroin painand deep disdainfor both life and death?They just seemed the sameWhat kind of a namewas kurt cobain?Americain with a European stainkurt with a hurta person with a painborn in the rainOnly way out was toblow out his brainsad-sad madDEAD!kurt cobain"
5,Great even if it is a rip off of the Pixies,"This is the quintessential cd of grunge rock even if it is just a rip off of the pixies. Kurt Cobain definitly did his work while he was with us and still continues to touch the rebelious, angst-filled teenager within all of us."
5,Smells Better Than Teen Spirit,"This album is true grunge. It's a spellbinding album! Some people think that ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" is their greatest song and it's not.. Some people only like Nirvana for that and they shouldn't, they are blinded about the impact ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" has and had and therefore, they think it's their only song, and their only great song... Just listen to the rest of the album and you're bound to see the greatness of the album, even without ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" So let's remember Nirvana for something more than ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" Let's just remember them in the ulitmate allure of Kurt Cobain and Nirvana"
2,Are you people nuts?,"This album changed the music industry for a few years and thats it. First of all the only good musician (technically speaking)is dave grohl. Using power chords and distortion does not make you a talents guitarist. Another thing, does anyone understand the lyrics on any of nirvana's songs? I have all their studio albums and i have no idea what he's talking about 90% of the time. the reason i gave this 2 stars is because of the drummer."
3,Being over rated isn't necessarily a bad thing,"Was Kurt Cobaina musical genius? No. Is Nevermind the most ground breaking album you will ever? No. Are Nirvana a great band? Yes. This is just an album's worth of good songs, nothing more, nothing less. Just like every other album ever made ever, 'Nevermind' has it's highs and lows. The high's being 'On a plain' and 'Lounge act', the lows being 'smells like teen spirit'. There are better albums, as are there worse. But really, who cares?"
3,Erm...,"It is a sad fact of life as well as the music industry that popularity of something is more determined by the hype surrounding it. For years I sincerely attempted to believe that Nirvana was a great band.What the hell?This band has created only two good songs (Teen spirit and Come as you are) in their entire career. The rest of the songs are average or just plain dull, and I forced myself to hear them time and again in the hope that I might somehow grow to like them. Sadly, the only reason you can find In Memory of Kurt T-shirts in campuses everywhere, even now is due to the coolness associated with the band and that was their selling point; not their musicianship or talent.The band had it not broken up when it did with the death of Kurt would have continued releasing medicore albums and faded away.Maybe you should start judging music by hearing it."
2,This is mostly bad noise,"There are a couple of decent tunes here and some really good drumming and thats the most of it. The lyrics are depressing and make no sense, the singing is mediocre, Cobain was not a great guitar player and certainly was not anyone to look up to as any kind of hero. For good music of that kind and time look to Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains and Smashing Pumpkins (Gish especially for the hard edge)."
5,Nevermind = A new era,"Looking back at this from the end of the decade, it's obvious that Nirvana started the 90s. First of all, grunge. They made it, and they ended it. It provided a new medium for musicians, and even now it influences music. It was said that Kurt died cause he wanted to take what he created to the grave with him, but he's failed. This album will live forever as a rare and great thing. Rock on!"
5,One of my all time favorites.,"Nevermind has got to be one of my most played albums.I think the only cd I play more is Dark Side Of The Moon by Pink Floyd.Kurt may or may not have been a ""genius"" but I do believe he was brilliant.He had a great voice and a unique songwriting style and played great guitar solos.Sure they were just three chords but so what.A great solo doesnt have to be all fancy and whatnot.The solo in Come As You Are is one of the greatest in the world.I still feel sorry for Kurt Cobain but Im also angry at him for killing himself.Who wouldnt be?Suicide is never the answer no matter how messed up you are people miss you too much.I never knew Kurt personally but I was a teenager back when Nevermind came out and I was always a Nirvana fan so I always missed him and his band.Nevermind stands as their best album and everyone should have it."
4,classic nirvana,"My friend told me I had to listen to this album, so I bought it, and now it's always in my cd player. Whether you like heavy metal, grunge, classic rock, or even pop, Nirvana has something for you as the classic alt. rock band."
5,one of the most underrated,"i don't understand why people try so hard to underrate it but here we have one of the most influential albums of all times.as it had happened to velvet underground in the early seventies,nirvana is appreciated by musicians like Tori Amos,Macy Gray,Orhan Gencebay and bands like the strokes,brmc,prodigy and so on.as a music fan this album still makes me think of starting my own band,expressing my anger to the new world order.anyway real music fans will always enjoy this music and Nevermind will be put to its well deserved place someday.because it's been more than 10 years since it was released and it sounds STILL as if it was released today."
2,"Sorry Kurt, you were good","People in 50 years will still be talking about John Lennon. The greatest songwriter of our time, Nirvana is just a passing fad. The Beatles are a legacy, they started it all."
3,I dunno...,"I like the record to some degree, but I think it's overrated. Kurt Cobain really didn't have that great of a range, in my opinion. Not to mention the whole record has been played back to front for YEARS. It gets old after a while. It has its highlights, however-'Polly' and 'Something in the Way' are fantastic. All in all, though, 'In Utero' was a much better record if you're seeking to try Nirvana for the first time."
4,Reach your own nirvana with Nevermind,"AFI K. James and his jabs at Nirvana are puzzling. Why does he harbor such seething resentment for Kurt Cobain? A more important question who is AFI K. James really? Could he be a former disgruntled roadie? A former groupie wannabe? My guess is that AFI K. James is the skinhead bouncer from a Nevermind-era show who repeatedly punched Kurt in the head for bashing his monitor board. He's probably still pissed Kurt smacked him upside the head and cut his bald skull open like he deserved. AFI has singlehandedly brought down the overall rating of Nevermind because he's submitted so many reviews bashing the band. Well, I say we fans continue to submit the honest, four-five star reviews Nevermind should get. Nevermind is an awesome CD, and there's no denying it. Lithium, Lounge Act, Drain You, and Teen Spirit are all songs alienated youth continue to relate to, and those songs are what Kurt should be rememebred for.5/5"
5,It's a classic.,"It is a classic. Plain and simple.All of the songs on the album are GREAT!!!!To the ignorant people who say this album isn't even good. I'm sorry that you're def, and you can't hear the PUNK/ROCK/POP melodies that make this album great.I could care less how much it sold, or how many people were influenced by it. I love the songs. Every single one.I'll say this again.....IT'S A CLASSIC!!! It's very rock 'n' roll. And if you don't like this album than I guess you don't like rock music.I rank ""NEVERMIND"" up there with the Beatles ""SGT. PEPPER'S"".And I'm a huge Beatles fan."
3,Nevermind,"I've been trying to hate Nirvana for some time now. I've finally caved and realized that this is a great album. You could call it a ""classic"" I suppose. I'm still not sure if it is one of the top ten all-time greatest, but maybe."
5,Funny,"It's very funny to read all these negative reviews from people who obviously are very frustrated by the fact that their little band doesn't get as much attention as Nirvana did. Those people are really really pathetic. I could name 1.000.000 bands I really hate, but I will NEVER spend one minute on reviewing those bands. I've better things to do. By writing all these negative reviews about Nirvana, you guys are basically saying that Nirvana is a relevant factor in your live. If you dont like Nirvana, just move on and do something usefull with your time, like listening to the bands you like and participating in discussion forums about those bands. Or just go hang out with some friends. Just get a life."
1,Another Loudness War remaster,"This is my second review of an album I just recently purchased that I was quite disgusted at the ""Remastering"" of it. I recently wrote a review of Rush Gold. It seems they have peaked dB very badly on this album also. I have good stereo equipment and like to turn music up but the way studio's are hyper-compressing music and clipping the living heck out of it just ruins it. It doesn't sound horrible at lower levels, but you just can't crank the heck out of it and expect it to sound good.I have included a screenshot of the waveform for Smells Like Teen Spirit in the pictures area. Notice, all the red in the picture is signal clipping!!"
2,CRAP,"Crap, returned, don't buy. All the reviews here thus far are dead on, save your money and get the ORG/RTI pressing."
5,MONUMENTAL !!!,"Everyone knows who Nirvana is. But how many of you actually listened to them??? The bottom line is, If you're a fan of music you should have already had this album back in 91...Pointblank! I don't care what type of musical genre you generally like, but everyone should have Nevermind in the collection. If you don't then you're playing yourself. This album changed America, and brought forth a whole new generation of Generation Xers. Who were free thinking ,politicaly conscious young adults. This album did for rock what Public Enemy's It Takes A Nation Of Millions did for hip-hop...It shifted an entire change in one sub-culture all together. Go Get this."
3,I wish I had gotten record number three!!!,My set came with two number four records and no number three!! How does this happen??Amazon gave me 25% of my money back but now I have to buy a second set. Bummer. If you need a record #4 let me know.
4,Great!,"I love this! It's great to hear all the different versions of these songs I grew up loving but I have one issue with this: A few songs on this I already own. It has a lot of versions that were on the box set, which are great, but why do I need these on this editon as well? I feel kind of cheated on that fact but overall, I love this editon. A must have for all hardcore Nirvana fans."
5,Awesome Set,"I couldn't wait for this set to come out. The hardback book is full of real amazing pictures of the band. Not only did my copy come with a poster, it also came with a Melody Maker magazine like the one pictured in the book. I'm not sure if this was a ""rare"" addition, but all the people I have talked to there's didn't include it. I got number 03461/10000 for anyone wondering"
2,It gets 2 for the drumming,"Well this album rejuvenated rock and destroyed it as fast as it appeared. Kurt Cobain was not a tortured soul as many believe, he was a druggy who could not get his life together, did not want to be mainstream, yet he became. He killed himself to take the cowards way out, or maybe he was so high, he used his shotgun as a pipe and accidentally ignited the bullet that killed them. He was not a guitar hero, he barely played it in this album, the bass was only audiblw because Kurt could not play that well, yet the bass was boring and subpar. And the songs were written by a crack addict with inaudible singing and awful writing.The only positive thing about Nirvana was Dave Grohl, his drumming was that made the band, quick, exploding drumming. At least he had the real talent in the band."
3,Some good tunes here...,"Don't get me wrong, Nirvana were talented. Even an assclown like some of the reviewers below who gave this 1-star are kidding themselves. Whether they were ""corporate"" or ""hypocritcal"" means nothing to me, I listen for the music. There are some really great songs here that stand the test of time, but my beef is this. Nirvana is way overrated. The only other bands I can think of that are this overrated are Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, oh..and every other band from the grunge-movement of the early 90's. These bands all combined made like one LP's worth of good songs that stand the test of time...that's it. It's a shame when slightly above-average rock bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam get so much glory when the true indie/alt rock of the era like Dinosaur Jr. and Pavement who made REALLY great music that needs to be heard."
1,aweful!!,"Oh my god this is the worst garbage i've ever heard!! Where are the decent hooks? where are the lush backing vocals?? the production is terrible!! the guitarist doesn't even play proper solos! how many notes per second can he manage?? doesn't even compare to the great guitarists of the 80s. maybe if mutt lang produced this album you might get something vaguely listenable, but honestly i don't think even mutt or bob rock could save this album from being complete crap."
1,Laaaaaaaammmmme,"Okay, guys, while I agree that emotion is important in music, there still has to be a minimum standard of technical proficiency. Thus, Nirvana does not cut mustard. They never did. Period."
1,Emotion is not a substitute for talent,"Alice in Chains and Soundgarden also made emotionally-charged music but they had musical finesse and creativity to spare. Thus, Nirvana has no relevance, or at least it SHOULDN'T."
1,"So overhyped, it's sick","Why is this even considered an essential album? I don't understand at all.First off, let me dispell the myth that Nirvana was the first band of its kind. Mudhoney was doing the exact same thing 3 years before Nirvana formed. Sure Nirvana turned mainstream music around, but their sound was by no means original.Now, we hit the dirt. Nirvana was just a terrible, noisy band. That's it. Their riffs were horrible, their guitar solos frightening, Kurt's voice like nails on the chalkboard. There were so many bands during that era, most of them far ahead of Nirvana when it came to talent and songwriting, but they never got the credit they deserved. Skip this and check out the Screaming Trees, Blind Melon, Mad Season, Temple of the Dog and Pearl Jam"
1,salvage,"thank goodness Nirvana are no longer. Cobain.. Kurt Cobain? Talentless. Cobain started this psuedo - alternative mindless garbage and imitators can still be heard today. This music was made popular by those who can only 'discover' new music by seeing videos on MTV. Nirvana made music without melody popular. He's lucky he aint around today because this ... got old 10 years ago. Nirvana took credit for things that other bands did so much better before them. Bands like The Replacements, Pixies, Clash, Sonic Youth. Nirvana did nothing new. They tried to sound like the Pixies or Westerberg but couldnt even come close."
1,I'm Confused,"I always thought that bands had to have talent before being considered a success. I've listened to this so-called ""great"" CD and have found absolutely nothing that I'd care to hear a second time--in fact, once was too much! It takes more than a knowledge of two chords to make music, and since when is a raspy-voiced vocalist who screams out filth at the top of his lungs considered a good singer?Throw this one on the trashheap besides the '70s disco albums and other failed musical tripe from the past."
1,Mindless teen anger and not much music.,"If you appreciate real music you probably know well enough to stay away from Nirvana anyway. Even so, this is the worst of all their albums. This is mindless juvenile ""16-years-old-and-mad-at-my-parents"" lyrics combined with equally mindless music. It's especially a shame this was so popular, since so many other bands have taken up the same way now. If you appreciate real music or at least something for people older than 16, do yourself a favor and skip this band."
3,Oh Well.........whatever..........nevermind.,"Teenspirit was definitely a Zeitgeist for the early 90's. This album is important for the effect it made on the music industry and the future of rock music. However looking back on this album after almost a decade, I find the album a bit uncreative and bland at times. Songwriting varies from good to mediocre."
1,Terrible,Bands from the 90s just sucked and Nirvana fits in with that. They had a couple of ok songs and Kurt Cobain was some what talented but this is nothing to get excited about. I can not for the life of me see the things people see that just go off about how great they were. I don't see it. This is another cd in a long line of cds from the 90s that are a disgrace to music.
2,WAY OVERRATED,NIRVANA are amongst one of the most overrated groups of all time after Green Day.They only made one decent song in Smells like teen spirit.Their other albums and songs are pure drivel and junk.DONT BUY THIS TERRIBLE ALBUM.Get TEN from PEARL JAM instead.
5,The Shot Heard Round The World,"Simply put, it is impossible to hear this album with fresh ears. In the autumn of 1991, the cathartic wails and ramshackle guitar work of Kurt Cobain, the thundering bass of Krist Novoselic, and the abuse of the drums by David Grohl exploded onto American radio in the form of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit."" Many people had never heard anything as astonishing as that single, but it didn't stop there.Subsequent hit ""In Bloom"" featured perhaps the messiest, most lurching guitar solo ever committed to tape. ""Come As You Are"" and ""Lithium"" were ballads, but unlike any to ever hit the mainstream. ""Breed"" and ""Territorial Pissings"" were raw blasts of punk-rock. ""Polly"" and ""Something In The Way"" were spare acoustic songs. ""Drain You"" even made a detour into psychedelia.It is a testament to how great Nirvana was that they were able to cover so much ground on one record and execute it with perfection. YOU MUST BUY THIS!"
5,The album that changed rock n' roll forever.,"1991. I was 12 years old and had no interest in music what so ever. Then I heard Smells Like Teen Spirit and it changed everything. Its a time I will never forget. Nothing sounded better at the time. These loud angry songs that just allowed you space to just loose it. All the songs are great and all have something to give. Time has not diminished the power of this album. Teen Spirit, In Bloom, Come As You Are, and Lithium only scratch the surface of what you will hear. Lounge Act, Drain You, Stay Away, and Breed are amazing powerful songs. And Something In The Way, a nice, quiet and beautiful song. An interesting way to end an album that brought anger and passion back into rock. Rarely does an album come out that changes everything so completely. This is one to those rare albums that did it. Just like people still talk about Highway 61 Revisited by Bob Dylan or Sgt. Pepper by the Beatles fourty years from now people will still be talking about Nevermind."
1,The worst band ever in the 70's!!!,dis is like da worst band in the 70s ever. itz got crap like smellz like teen spirit and come as u r. dis sucks. if u want some good crap den go listen ta lil jon. YEAHHHH OKKK
2,lousy-only 4 good songs,"This cd is really lousy, the 4 good songs on the album are the classics Smells like teen spirit, in bloom, come as you are, & lithium. this is overrated and lousy."
1,"""In Utero"" was there best, this is there worst.","this is the worst of Nirvana, dont buy this, buy all there other albums including ""In Utero"", there best.My favourite Nirvana songs out of 5.1. Rape Me (In Utero)2. Heart-Shaped Box - (In Utero)3. Come As You Are - (Nevermind)4. Milk It - (In Utero)5. About A Girl - (Bleach)See, most of these songs are of (In Utero), buy all there other ones, buy this too, but down think it as there best."
1,Pile of Garbage,"I never really liked the hair bands of the late 1980's. They always seemed a little too goofy for a die-hard headbanger like me. I liked some of them, though. And at least they were keeping the metal spirit alive. But then in early '92, Nirvana hit. I hated them from the start. They killed off all metal had been in the 1980's. They sang about dumb subjects like how depressed that idiotic Kurt Cobain was and teenage angst. Who the hell wants to hear about that? Besides, it started a revolution of horrible nu metal, pop punk, and alternative bands that would still be flowing today if it weren't for band like The Darkness and Andrew WK. This is a stinking pile of putrid trash. I hate everyone who was in this band with all my heart."
1,minus 10000000000000000 stars! The worst album ever!,"Kurt cobain was worst than avril lavigne.Read any lyric composed by him. It's just terrible.Do yourself a favour: go on and buy Exile on main street and listen to REAL MUSIC. Kurt burns in hell now. We all hate you, KUrt. You were a terrible lyricist."
1,Dull moments... forgettable 'melodies',"The people who like this band, don't know what is the good music.The singer has got a forgettable voice, there's much better singers than Kurt Cobain. His guitar playing is extremely dull.They're weak musicians, with no conception, with no charachter. One melodie going throgh a song. Boring stuff. Lithium: it's melodie is strained, unmemorable. The music is primitive: they're about a plain 'melodie', and ther's no change in the music. Amazing guitar and drum solos? Where? A great voice with a good vocal range? Not Kurt. And they're very overrated. And they're more popular since Kurt has died. RIP, but he was not a talented musician, not a guitar-hero etc.I don't want to your take away pleasure. There's many good bands, whom made great music, for example: Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin etc. Buy their albums: they're talented, and they can make good music. Trust me."
2,it's ok but...,"This is an ok album. If you're going to get a Nirvana album, get Bleach or In Utero. Nevermind is extremely overrated and thank goodness I never bought it. Nirvana was a good band, but please do not put them in the same class as the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin etc. Those bands have more classic songs under thier belt and lasted for more than a decade. Nirvana wasn't even around for 10 years. They were a fad. Let's be serious. A straight up fad. Nirvana was popular for only one song and we all know which one that is. So bash all the classic rock bands I listed, but you'll soon realize that each of them have contributed way more to rock and music in general. Don't listen to mags like Rolling stone or Spin b/c they're liars. They even put Kurt at #12 for 100 greatest guitarists. That's a joke. Kurt wasn't even good w/ guitar in the first place. Good songwriter, bad guitarist. Hopefully I helped you a bit."
2,Overrated!!,"Sorry --This type of music was done better by the likes of Husker Du,Meat Puppets,etc. Listenable and competent but groundbreaking??--I personally dont think so. Hats off to Nirvana for being in the right place at the right time at around the same age as a bunch of disaffected suburban kids in the US. And to the guy who said this album stands up to Never Mind The Bollocks and London Calling--you have got to be kidding!!"
1,Nirvana stinks,"I have some words for you who like this album that belongs in the dump. Kurt Cobain is not a legend only a guy who could not deal with fame so he killed himself. This band should not be put on level of good bands such as the Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin. BTW Smells like Teen Spirit is a crappy song!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"""Native"" applies to Europeans","This is an excellent -- and useful -- book for those who wish to use native trees for their bonsai. However, to get the best benefit from it, you need to live in Europe, since the 'natives' are from that continent."
2,"Great poetry, horrible e-book layout","Side-by-side poetry translations are great in paper book format where you have one language on one side and the other language on the other side, but in ebook format it just doesn't work. The French and the English run into each other at the most inopportune of times. It's hard enough to follow along with Mallarmé's work :) don't make it that much harder by including the French. Please offer a volume that's just the English, in the meantime, this just instills frustration where it is not needed :("
1,"GREAT work, poor formatting","one star (i'd give it less if i could) for formatting.5 stars (i'd give it more if i could) for the quality of writing.7 some dollars for this abomination? 1 dollar would be more fair. actually, with this formatting, it is a crime to pay anything.nearly unusable. i will very much appreciate it if amazon doesn't stock these books any more. it's pretty lame and is putting me off from buying."
4,Read the Book,"This movie was quite controversial. It does not show the good side of the employers or even those in power to help when there is so obvious a problem. You get the sense of the discrimination the immigrants experienced. However, the movie only covers a portion of the excellent book. One that will haunt you even more."
1,NOT THE FILM VERSION OF THE NOVEL,"This terrible film is called ""Give Us This Day"" NOT ""Christ in Concrete"" and there's a reason for that. It is NOT the film version of Pietro di Donato's classic novel, Christ in Concrete, but a film version of the novel's backstory (a sort of prequel). Unfortunately, Christ in Concrete has NEVER been made into a film."
3,Another Differential Geometry Book - So So,"This book I also purchased as a resource for studying differential geometry. It's a little bit better than the one by Thorpe, but not by much. The text is dedicated to the 'hard-core' mathematical, and even they would have to have some experience/guidance in this subject. I'm a self-learning type of guy, with an MS in physics. Too many questions arise to justify this book for the self-learner. There are problems, and a FEW examples."
5,Historical Classic,"I have both read aloud A Lion to Guard Us and have listened to the book as my son read it to me. Both times, I was impressed by the simplicity of its structure, which allowed the storyline and history surrounding England, Bermuda, and Jamestown to come alive. The author did a superb job, and this book is on its way to becoming a classic in historical children's literature."
3,A Lion to Guard Us,It was an OK Book. It was not very exciting but if you were just wanting to learn about American History it is a great book. It is about a girl and her yonger siter and brother who go from England to Jamestown to live with there dad because there mother dies.
4,daughter enjoyed immensely,"my daughter enjoyed this book a great deal, it was fairly easy and interesting reading. It is set during the period of time that Jamestown, Va. was becoming established which was a nice tie-in for what we were studying in History"
3,THE LION TO GUARD US,"Lion to guard us reviewI would read lion to guard us if you like not to fast and not to slow books. Lion to guard us is a somewhat sad story a slow and some might put a little dull adventure.There are three main characters. One is Meg the youngest girl, jimmy is in the middle for the ages. Amanda is the oldest and looks after them. Lion to guard us is a middle problem. Like when people steal oh wait I don't want to give the book away if you want to know read this book. Meg Jimmy and Amanda are going to Virginia for a reason and if you want to know the reason READ THIS BOOK!!!!"
2,NOT VERY GOOD FOR OLDER KIDS,"I've read this book twice, it was okay the first time but I was only 8. This book is good for younger kids, Maybe for kids 7 - 10. This book is REALLY BORING for older kids."
4,A Good Adventure,"This book is about three children whose father is in America helping to settle the colonies. Shortly after he leaves for America the children's mother dies leaving them with nothing and no one to look after them. The oldest child Amanda decided to take a boat to America and find their father. On the ship ride to America, there is a terrible storm and the ship is wrecked. The three children are forced to live in a hut on an island with other families from the ship until a new ship can be built.This historical fiction is a great adventure for children in 3-5th grade. I enjoyed the vivid details that helped draw me into the story. I couldn't put the book down. It is a story of courage sure to get the imaginations of children going.The author of this book conveyed a strong message of courage and a determination to live your dreams. This adventure had an inspiring tail of overcoming struggle and working together to survive."
3,a lion to guard us review,"This story is about a girl named Amanda freebold and her 2 younger siblings, Jemmy and Meg. At the beginning the 3 children and their mother live with a rich old lady named mistress trippet In London, England. She makes them work for money, except Meg and Jemmy. Their father went to Virginia to seek fortune. One day their mother got sick and eventually dies, so they run away from mistress trippet. They run into their mother's doctor Dr. Crider who takes them in. the next month they get on a ship to go to Virginia, it shipwrecks in Bermuda, they make a small town and leave on 2 makeshift boats to Virginia.... My favorite part is when Dr. Crider finds the children running away.By: Patrick"
3,Watch when you may need a caculator handy,I got this watch and it looks sleek. The keypad is the biggest turn off. Unless you have micro fingers it will be a pain to use the key pads. It's not difficult just slow compared to other calculator watches. Also it's not water proof. I bought it because it was cheap and the calculator function. I mainly use it when I go shopping.
3,"Disappointed w/ product, NOT service.","I received the product as promised and the transaction went smoothly. Once I received the product, I was VERY disappointed in Casio. Their instructions are NOT clear or easy to follow. It took me about a day and a half of going back to it to figure out just how to set the time. I love technology and I usually find all technology easy to use - not this!"
5,Casio Watch EDB610-1C,I purchased this watch as a direct replacement to one that I damaged. While I do not use all the features the ones I use are great. Having many of my most used phone numbers available all the time is a great convenience to me. I also use the calculator feature almost daily.The other features such as the stop watch and alarm are rarely used but are nice to have.I highly recommend this watch. I have been using Casio data bank watches for the past 15 years and have never been disappointed with their quality. They are a great choice for the price.
2,"Casio e-data Bank Watch, DATE MEMORY 350","I took my Casio e-data Bank Watch, DATE MEMORY 350, to a respected jeweler to change the battery after only 6 months use (I bought the watch NEW!). The jeweler was unable to replace the battery and reassemble the watch successfully. Buyers beware! Your watch will work as advertised until the original battery dies. Replacing the battery is a gamble you may best avoid."
4,This watch has a lot of features but not water resistance,"OK, first of all this watch is the best watch I've had since forever. this watch does everything. since I'm only thirteen(I'm using my dads account) i need something like this for school. some people said this watch was bad because the writing wipes away NOT TRUE I've had this since February 10th and now its august 5th and no problems yet its the best watch I have ever had but i got to watch out when i wash my hands because this thing is NOT WATER RESISTANT and its obvious because i can see the space between the buttons and the actual body but this thing rocks. Since sometimes i forget things now i can just save it in the databank and the password is also great. bottom line this thing is awesome and useful because i have everybody's phone number on my hand so i can always call anyone if i have a phone"
4,Glad I got it,"I was initially put off by the review that said this was an over-ambitious watch. I'm glad I read the next, and went to the owner's manual online at Amazon. I've had this watch for a few weeks and like it a lot. It's readable, the basic features are easy enough to use, and it has what I want: alarm, stopwatch, timer, calculator, databank. Oh, and a timekeeper! The light is bright enough, the numbers easy to read. Good watch for the money."
2,Plastic band often breaks,"I've had two Casio watches and I am always having problems with the plastic band. It would break right where the band is connected to the watch. Does anyone know if the metal bands are any better? I am really tired of buying Casio watches if their plastic bands are always going to break, usually within 2 years of use. It's a good watch and I like the features but I think the product is poorly made."
4,Casio Men's Databank Digital Watch #EDB610-1C,This is my first casio watch of such model.I find it much easy to use especially with its time displayed in much bigger fonts.The different timezones offered are very useful and practical for a business traveller. I wish it offered the capability to customize the name of a city in each of the 24-hour zones.One thing I have not found yet is how to set the time in 24-hour format instead of 12-hour format.The user guide that comes with it is printed in a much smaller fonts than is comfortable to read.
3,The last book Ms. Wentworth wrote,"This book was the last that Patricia Wentworth wrote, and I think that she did a pretty good job of it over all. It is different than most of her other books in that the main character suffers from amnesia, but she does remember beng with a dead girl. The story is about Anne's search for herself and for the killer of the girl that was laying at the bottom of the cellar. It is a bit overdone and quite too many coincidences, but it was still a pretty good read. For myself, I have one Miss Silver book left to read (an earlier one than this one), and then I will have made my way through them all, and they were pretty good fun."
2,Not her best,The well was running dry and this one was very confused I thought. Not up to the pace she set in the early going..
5,Funny but honest look at marriage,"Becky has not written a 'how to' book on marriage but has written an honest account of her relationship. It must have taken alot of courage to expose herself to us the readers, but thank you. It has helped me see that marriage isn't all roses but sometimes alot of hard work and that there aren't easy fixes to problems. A lot of laughs - which is good medicine. I definitely recommend this book."
4,Help your daughter understand why little Jimmy is so weird...,"Saw this at the library and had to read it: the title itself was worth the check-out. As a well-worn parent of both boys and girls I'll say that the two are different - it's hard to believe how many people tell me they're not. (Later I find that these good minded folks have either one child or none.) Yes, boys want to look up girls skirts. Boys, especially as they get older, have only one or two things on their mind when it comes to girls. This applies to pretty much every boy who has ever lived. Girls, who obviously have their own drives and interests, just don't think like this and this is where your daughters can get into trouble. This funny and very readable little book can help both parents and girls understand better what's going on with little Jimmy."
5,"I Laughed, I Cried...(really!)","It has been a long time since a book has made me laugh out loud, but never has a book brought me to tears. I felt like I was taken on an incredible journey with the author, hearing about his life experiences and lessons learned - and remembering my own and how they have affected my life. It is a book that everyone can relate to, regardless of where they grew up, how they were raised, or where their interests lie. Certain experiences, such as being taunted, going to high school parties and peer pressure, losing a loved one, your first ""love"", etc., ring true for all of us. Although I am neither a teenage girl or a parent yet, I feel as if it spoke to the fifteen-year old that was me as well as the future parent that I hope to someday be. I just wish that my parents, who always have been wonderful, loving and supportive, had been able to communicate that way with me when I was growing up...because I really needed it at the time!"
5,"Proud to give it to my 14 year old daughter, after I read it!","I read the book on two plane rides and a short layover. A quick read but very moving and right to the point. When I gave it to my 14 year on her birthday, she read it in about 8 hours, off an on, and couldn't put it down. She even discussed parts of it with me. The author gentlely touches all issues from tatoos to sex and meanness. I was proud of the way he approached the subjects. Buy it for your daughter, but read it first."
3,Not really that great,"The books is a real simple read for any teenager, very much a conversational style. Uses a lot of personal stories to drive the point home. I found some the suggestions a bit trite.He deals with issues of faith (one of the longer chapters) with less conviction as other topics (ie, sex, drugs). He encourages his daughters to search out religion but that's about it. Passing on one's faith as importants as advice any of the other topics in the book. It fell a little short."
1,SEXIST AND UNEVOLVED,"As a mother of boys, the title and tone of the book are not only insulting to boys but a disservice to girls as well.I would like to think that we as a people have evolved since the days of clubbing and dragging back to the cave - Will someone please tell Mr. Van Munching that humankind is actually capable of a level of interaction where members of the opposite sex can share intellect, common interests and friendship? Or shall we just wait for his sequel: ""Girls will get pregnant to trap boys from rich families"".It's the year 2005 - give me a break."
5,Funny! Great! I LOVE it!,"Okay, I just turned thirteen. So for my birthday, I get to go to B&N. (I'm a book worm) As I'm looking through the teens area, I notice this book. Ah, what the heck, couldn't hurt to take a peek, Right? Wrong. Hurt very much. That is to say that I was Laughing so hard, I was sure my sides were going to split. My dad is a major Worry Wort. I understand why he worrys, though. This book is just like my dad, only much funnier. And my dad is pretty funny. So this book is great. I highly recomend this for teen girls. No I'm not saying you have probs, but if for nothing else, It's a funny book. The things he talks about in the book ARE important, and it is important to wipe the tears out of your eyes so you could read it. My mom was busting up and nodding her head at the same time. My dad aproves of it as well. My sis is eight, and I'll give it to her when I'm done with it. So it's good for every one. I don't think boys will like it very much, though..."
3,"Not what I expected, but still good","Be prepared, this CD is more acid than funk, but it is still great. If you like Acid Jazz collections, you will love this, but if you're looking for something more organic, you may want to pass. This is an electric anthology with minimal use of the wah and brass. Though it was not what I expected, the magnetic beats definitely yanked me out of my seat."
2,Leaking & confusing,"I bought this at Target for the same price of about $20. One of the pots leaks and I've taken it apart twice to fix it. The rubber seals must not be in place right since all the parts seem to be there. The top button you push to pour is very confusing to everyone. Who expects to push a button down on a carafe and have it stay down with a click like a light switch? This produces these results in my guests:* What do I do?* They pump it like an air pot (click, click, click, ....)* They push the button down and leave it down, allowing the coffee to cool fasterNot really the best design but they look nice and are cheap. Well, I'm here on Amazon to find replacements because these are going back."
1,Have Gone To Seed,"A very disappointing film starring one of the better western actors. It is such a comedown for Richard Boone of the ""Have Gun Will Travel"" fame. Boone probably did this project because he needs the money or just becuase he needs to do something. The film is a pathethic and boring excuse for a western which is neither spaghetti or whatever. It is sad to see a legend like Boone to take on something trashy as this project. The blurry, fuzzy, and hazy picture quality is just as bad as the story. I don't recommend this to anyone including fans of Richard Boone."
2,"Not for ""flat feet""","This is the 3rd pair of shoes from Charles David that I've ordered from Amazon. The shoe itself is very attractive and the color very rich, however, if you have low to no arches and narrow heels--this is not the shoe for you ladies. I have flat feet and always wear heels to cover this, but in this shoe, the strap up the side of my feet and around the heel did not provide any support and the shoe ""gapped."" I bought specifically to wear with a dress and it did not look good."
1,Needs Redesign,"In my 59 years as a farm boy and then an engineer, I've seen some poorly designed products...and this one needs some work. Our water quality is quite good but my hydrants eventually begin to weep after it is shut down. I was sold these with the assurance by the sales person that the working/moving parts could be serviced above-ground. NOT-SO. The stem was so well stuck that I was sure that I was going to break it if I pulled any harder. So I reassembled the unit and worked the handle and adjusted the tension until it finally quit leaking. That is the last time I've used either of the units. Now these exist as legacy waste on my farm and a lesson learned. Don't buy these unless you want to dig them out of the ground after 3-4 years. Bad Product."
2,It could be better...,"A nice book that tries to take a snapshot of an historical period. The idea is somewhat good but, unfortunately, the book has no head and no tail. Moreover, there is too much sex, even for an Italian reader."
5,The Best Musical Ever Written,"Passion is an excellent show. It won the Tony for best musical in 1994.One of the things that I find most fascinating about this score is the way it flows from song to dialogue and back again. Songs segue into one another without breaking flow or style. There are no set applause points, no big dance numbers, just a moving, touching story told with some of the most beautiful music ever written for the stage.If you are a Sondheim fan at all, or if you would like to own an achingly beautiful collection of love songs, this is definitely the score for you."
3,Not enough room for big laptops,"The Lowepro Slim large is a pretty thin bag. It did fit my Dell 17"" inspiron computer. But just barely. The two pockets on the front are very small and could only just hold the power cord in one and the mouse in the other. But they made the front stick out funny and the flap hard to close. It wouldn't hold anything else. It is essentially like a sleeve bag. I ended up returning it because it didn't hold enough stuff. But if you want just a thin, light bag, for just the laptop then this would be good."
5,Old and new coming nicely together,"These projects are well graded for the beginner and the more advanced worker. The text and photographs are of a high quality, clear and not over wordy. Patterns are well crafted and will make good copies. Nice combination of traditional ways of working with more progressive ideas Easily understood for this beginner. I highly recommend this book to those looking for a bit of inspiration!"
3,"Light, fluffy, and fun","Some lazy weekend afternoon, pour yourself a cup of tea and sit down with this charming little petit four of a book. Should you require a modicum of instruction in the gentle art of tact, rest assured, your lean collection of shopworn excuses will emerge polished to a swanky sheen. You may even pick a few sly new tales with which to bewitch your audience unaware. You will feel slippery enough to escape even the stickiest of predicaments. If, however, you happen to be one of nature's more cunning creations, capable of fending of the most persistent of life's little inconveniences with a nonchalance that borders on the virtuosic, you may snicker quietly behind the shielding pages in the pleasure of a well-shared private joke."
3,Faulty premises,"Martinet's book is at times useful and amusing, but I have to disagree with its underlying premises: that lying is OK and that selfishness is more rewarding than doing things for other people. While there are times when the techniques she describes would come in handy, I would find it exhausting (and lonely) to have to be that creative about dodging people all the time!"
1,Since when is it permissible to lie through life??,"Lying is NOT an acceptable means for getting out of your responsibilities. This type of book adds to the free-fall of society by endorsing the notion that it's just fine to break a commitment to someone and not suffer any consequences. This is all done under the idea that as long as you're not rude about it, then it's fine. Nothing could be further from the truth."
3,Check your shipment close,"Had to rate a 3 because, sent me one shock that was defective, front shock hole, for bolt was wrong. I should have opened each box and checked bolt hole size. Had to send back and get another one, already had damaged old shock getting it off, had to wait couple days with truck jacked up. If you have a problem, find the call me now option on amazon and get it taken care of, pretty quickly, with the INDIA accented dude. Got shock and put it on. Seems to be working OK. I was really expecting a more heavy duty shock, but it is what I ordered. Heard good things about Bilstein shocks, but these are good enough for my old truck....."
2,Badly proofed,"I struggled mightily through the typographical errors in this book, and after reading it, I find it hard to believe that the book ever was edited. Normally I am not the type to fuss unduly over the odd error here and there, but I am certain that, were I to highlight all of the errors I caught in this book, a reader might be hard-pressed to discover the CORRECT words, sentences, etc. Despite all of that, the book gave a systematic overview of the conflict, from its early stirrings in 1945 to its impact today. It is generally well laid out, and the writing is concise and easy to read, excepting the glaring typos."
2,Will the real Troggs please stand up,"Wow. ""Wild Thing"" just isn't wild when you are singing it at 60 years old. I guess the remaining Troggs needed some cash. These songs are redone by some original Troggs members and it isn't all bad. The redione version of ""Love is all around"" is pretty close to the original. So if you are a die-hard Troggs fan, you will want to hear how they sound now. But, if you are like me and just enjoy them for a few songs stay FAR FAR away from this release."
2,Define Essential,"I have a few CDs from the Essential collection and for the most part, I'm satisfied. I have not purchased this CD, lets get that out right now. Now what does essential mean as far as music? Shouldn't it mean necessary, as in those songs necessary to get a good understanding of the group/artist? That leans to the first obvious point. How is this collection on only ONE CD? Looking at the list of songs on this CD leads me to a few other things. This is primarily music late in the career of the Jacksons. If not for their early work, would they have even been able to make the song included on this disc? Where are the hits they are most know for--Who's Lovin' You, I'll Be There, Got to Be There? Sure they where known as the Jackson 5 at the time, but is it ""Essential"" to separate the two virtually same groups? If so, why not release ""The Essential Jackson 5"" on the same day to elliminate questions? This set just leaves you with too many questions, hence the 2 star rating."
3,The Essential Jacksons,"I was pleased to see this collection from the Jacksons based on their Epic Records releases. I would liked to have seen more songs from 'Victory,' such as ""Torture"" and ""Body."" Also noticed that ""Heartbreak Hotel"" is listed as ""This Place Hotel."" I definitely bought this cd!"
1,Boooooooooooo!,"At long last a Jacksons compilation. However what is missing BIG TIME is the John Luongo remix of Shake your body (Down to the Ground) The original mix is boring. The 12"" mix is exciting, and it is unfair to not haver it on this collection. What I would have done was replace the boring 8 minute unmix of shake with John's remix, replace the LP track version of Blame it on the Boogie with the 12 inch version (both NOw on the re-release of Destiny and toss in an extra track from Victory."
3,"WHERE IS ""TORTURE"" ?!?!?!?!?!","Am I blind or did the creators of this compilation severely miss the biggest Jacksons hit ?!?!?!?!WHERE IN THE WORLD IS ""TORTURE"" ?!?!?!??!"
4,The Essential Jacksons,"What a collection of hits. Most of the songs on here are worth the listen. ""Enjoy Yourself"" is a motivator. ""Show You the Way to Go"" delivers enthusiasm. ""Going Places"" is an upbeat track for traveling. ""Find Me a Girl"" is a brilliant slow jam. I liked the uplifting ""Blame it on the Boogie."" ""Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)"" gets you to dance. The instruments are used robustly in ""Lovely One."" ""This Place Hotel"" has good guitar rhythms and horns. You'll enjoy the guitar used in the blazing ""Can You Feel It."" The breakup but upbeat hit ""Walk Right Now"" utilized flute, keyboards and guitar. ""State of Shock"" was a spectacular duet with the famous Mick Jagger, head of the Rolling Stones."
1,Floor mats were NOT what I expected,"The ""rear"" floor mats were HUGE. I had to jam them under the seats - they are MUCH, MUCH bigger than they appear in the advertised photo. I have a 2007 Nissan Murano and they were supposed to fit - they don't."
4,Excellent - A slice in time of Southern American Politics,"I found this book an entirely beleivable representation of American politics. How a very few people use the election system to ensure the results they are desiring. Growing up in the Northeast after the height of the civil rights movement, I found the way that the race issue was handled quite an eye-opener."
1,Whose your Daddy?,"Let me know when the COMPLETE FIRST SEASON is released or don't waste my time on this nonsense. This is more of a ""review"" than this trash needs. MRFD is an extremely well made show that deserves more than this pittance."
1,"So bad, I couldn't bring myself to read the whole book.","Thank goodness I took the book out of the library. Had I ordered the book this would have been the first and only book I sent back in disgust at the writing style. To even refer to Jane Austen and this book in the same breath is an insult to Austen. The writing is stilted, dull and frankly, written to a level of a third grader. There are much better ""Austenesque"" books out there - and I would much rather read ""Sense and Sensibility"" for the tenth time than this drivel. I wanted to give it ""zero"" but can't!"
5,Reason and Romance by Debra White Smith,"I have found all of Debra White Smith's books modernizing the Jane Austen classics to be charming, witty and entertaining. The author does a marvelous job of closely following the plot in a modern setting. Her characters are believable. ""Reason and Romance"" retells ""Sense and Sensibility."" I thoroughly enjoyed this delightful book and I recommend it to all Jane Austen fans and even those unfamiliar with the classic novels."
5,Loved REASON AND ROMANCE by Debra White Smith,Thoroughly enjoyed REASON AND ROMANCE by Debra White Smith. What a splendid idea to enhance the classics -- and that's precisely what this author has done -- ENHANCE! Her unique characterization and pacing prevails as usual. I highly recommend this series to individuals and libraries.
4,virgin islands,"A great overview map with enough information to get around. Plastic coating makes it travel friendly. Visiting St John USVI last summer (2009) this map helped us get a feel for the island. The scale did not allow for much on island use, but the locals were very helpful with navigation. Most of the Taxi-shuttle drivers are very friendly and it was easy to get anywhere."
3,decent..,"decent show... not terrible, not amazing... good for a laugh..no issues with playno issues with purchaseno issues at all!"
1,Just Terrible. AVOID!!,Yuk! Maybe the worse show I have ever seen. My life will always be a little worse after seeing this. AVOID!!
1,this show is pure trash,i hate this show with a firey passion why do we need to see more of these mtv jersey shore morons they are a waste of time this tv show sucks do not buy this lame show buy something else with more intelligence in it not this trashy show snooki and jowoww are both seriously are bad role models
1,Beware of the supplier - Netstokr - Received wrong item 2 months ago and still issue is not resolved,"I have ordered this deluxe version of the Hooked On Phonics reading system through Amazon. The supplier was Netstokr. I received the regular version which does not have the interactive CD. In my opinion, the CD is the most important component of this system and I bought it mainly for the CD. Supplier did not respond to my email informing that wrong item was delivered. The issue is yet to be resolved 2 months after placing the order. I do not recommend this seller and can not comment on the reading system itself."
5,This is a WISE BOOK,harrased and discriminated by the medical segment...Why?It says the truth about HOW TO HARVEST ORGANS WITHOUT GETTING IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW..Everyone should read THIS HONEST BOOK !!!
2,"The authors are sincere, but misinformed.","This book has some interesting points about practices in modernmedicine-advanced life support, organ transplants, care for theelderly-but to equate these practices with brutal pagan practices a la the New Age Movement is unrealistic and a disservice to health care providers. Organ transplantation is not ""cannibalism&quot. I'm sure the authors are sincere, but I wish they were better informed. At least, some interesting medical cases are discussed. END"
1,Disappointment,I found this book to be pedestrian. The ideas presented in this book are outdated. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
4,Rare book - difficult to give a score,"This book is a rare type of book, and it's difficult to evaluate. Let's start from the negative - it's too long (3 volumes), too detailed and partially boring. Sometimes it's difficult to see forest behind the trees.But this is the real book based on real personal experience of a very extraordinary man. How many books we have like this? Almost none. In this it stands out against too many New Age books where authors write too much about construction of the Universe and too little about personal experience.If you want just to buy another New Age book to read about unity with Divine before going to sleep - leave it, it's not for you. But if you want to do something apart from just reading (to walk the path, and not just to know it) you may find here invaluable information for your own journey. If you will invest some time and patience."
5,Very Helpful,"I'm a first year medical student and hadn't had immunology until I was taught it in about two weeks this year. This book was exceptionally helpful in giving me the big picture while still providing enough detail to unite the big pieces together. The book isn't exhaustive, but it's not meant to be. It's also very easy to read and memorable. This book was quite useful to me and I highly recommend it."
4,Good book,"I got this book for a graduate class I am taking in immunology; although, I didn't really need it, it was helpful."
2,"Good start, but then it gets confusing","I never write reviews, but I thought it is very important for me to write a review. I bought this book because I really had a difficult time understanding immunogy and it seemed like a worthwhile book to get. THe book starts out great, but then it just get too complicated. I I think this book is best for those with a average background in immuno. I am sorry to write this review, but I have to be honest."
4,Can save your life... or your grade.,"I ordered this book for FAST shipping 4 days before my first medical school final exam. What I was most impressed with is the great overview that let me place all my specific knowledge (the prof's love the detail...) into a big picture scheme. I especially love how they liken the MHC receptor's to hot-dog buns.A fun book to read (even when doing immunology) and SUPER helpful and quick to get through. I did very well with this book.Not a good primary text for studying and also not helpful for board review, but a great introduction for people who need the big picture of the immune system fast. Also helps you understand the players in a fun and accessible way. A GREAT resource for those without prior immuno expereience"
5,A great overview,"As someone with a clinical/science background who was relatively unfamiliar with the ""making of the sausage"" behind the immune system, this book has been a perfect primer. The book is well-written with explanations which, in general, do a great job of walking the fine-line between explaining interesting complexities and confusing the reader. I recommend this book for anyone who has a science, clinical or technical background and who wants to improve their understanding of the immune system."
4,Good book,"I love political cartoons, especially ones from the 1800s. I enjoyed the ones here very much, although I wished the some were full page (like others) so you can read the little stuff in a Nast cartoon. There's a little too much chatter (for me) about the times of the country when the cartoon was done, as opposed to just a caption explaining it. And a few more cartoons. It's just my preferences, however, and this is really good book, very broad ranged and well presented. The book came at the correct time and in VG condition, so opinion of the seller is very positive. (I'm not sure if this review is JUST for the book or both)"
4,Vital Remains - Into Cold Darkness,Songs Include : Immortal Crusade / Under The Moon's Fog / Crown Of The Black Hearts / Scrolls Of A Millenium Past / Into Cold Darkness / Descent Into Hell / Angels Of Blasphemy / Dethroned Emporer / Countess Bathory
3,Increased headaches . .,"I'm sure this helps a lot of people and I did notice my husband had more energy, but increased his already daily headaches, so sadly had to discontinue."
5,Good Product,"With the tough economic times, I have experienced more stress and a negative attitude. I believe the SAM-e helps lighten my mood a bit."
5,great,"I love this SAM-e by Nature Made.and the 90 pills box is the best deal there is!helps me with my Fibromyalgia, not too much, but every bit helps.better sleep and less pain."
1,SAM-E lingering side effects even after stopping,"I took 100 mg (half of a 200 mg pill) of SAM-E three weeks ago, only once, and then discontinued it. Now, I am still having disturbed sleep.The brand I used was Nature Made.I would advise anyone to be very careful with SAM-E, and beware of lingering side effects even after stopping it."
5,Positive Experience,"I was a little doubtful about taking this supplement, but I have been suffering from mild depression and sleeplessness and didn't want to start on a prescription antidepressant. After a week of taking this product, I found that I was handling stess much better than usual. I encountered an extremely difficult situation in my personal life and found that I did not ""go to pieces,"" but handled it in a calm and confident manner. I didn't even cry (which would normally have been my first response). I am also sleeping better and feeling more rested. I plan to continue taking this supplement."
5,Love my Sam-e!,"I've been taking the supplement SAM-e for about a year. It has really helped me feel more grounded, less stressed out. I did a lot of investigating before beginning with SAM-e, all the info I collected seemed very positive. I don't see any side effects, perhaps more happiness?--more emotional even-ness? Highly recommend this product!"
1,Tramplers got Trampled,"I ordered this video from an Amazon vendor in Florida. Unfortunately, I was never able to view it because it arrived broken. I did get my money back from Amazon after the vendor refused to exchange it. I originally ordered this video because I had met Gordon Scott at one time in Portland, Oregon and thought it would be fun to see him in a Western instead of as Tarzan. I don't know if there is a biography out on Gordon Scott, but I understand that he lived his later life as a recluse until his death. And, that is too bad, because he was a very handsome, outgoing actor at the time I met him. I would still like a copy of Tramplers if it ever comes out on DVD."
1,Bridge Separated from Body on Arrival,"I ordered this for my son's birthday based on the many positive reviews. The night before his birthday, I inspected it for wrapping and discovered that It had arrived with the bridge completely separated from the body. It's clear that this particular guitar has manufacturing defects. There are holes for 4 dowels in the bridge, but only 2 holes in the body and only one dowel used period, so it looks like only 1 dowel and a lot of glue were used to hold the bridge to the body. This is almost certainly specific to this guitar, or perhaps the batch it came from but I'd warn anyone who orders it to inspect it carefully on arrival! We are thankful for Amazon's reasonable return process."
1,Waste of money,"This keychain game of Scrabble is cute but that's about it. It's overpriced and useless. The letter tiles are TINY and extremely thin. I understand this is just a keychain version of the game, but I bought it in store at Barnes & Noble so I wasn't able to tell what it was like inside.I wouldn't consider this a toy (hence the low ratings). This is more of a collector's item, or a cute ye impractical and un-useable gift."
3,Really too small,It is good to have in your pocket but really hard to play with. You need a magnifizer to see it.
4,Pretty Pictures. Hollywood Hair.,"This is a gorgeous video with a great soundtrack and a simple but universal plot.However, it suffers from Richard Gere's hair. It's like a $300 salon haircut that is perfectly blowdried and combed out in every shot. It makes the rest of the movie ring false."
3,An awful movie that was beautifully filmed.,"I purchased this movie for my boyfriend, who is interested in film and hopes to make movies himself. He wanted it because he heard that it was a true testament to beautiful cinematography. He absolutely loved it, saying it was so beautifully made. I, on the other hand, loathed this movie. It was depressing, slow, and lacked dialogue. The characters were all unlikable and the plot was pretty stupid.So, if you're a film person, you may find this worth purchasing for the cinematic qualities, but if you're just, say, a Richard Gere fan and are curious, I beg of you, don't waste your time or money."
2,90 Minutes of Wheat,"Although that might sound interesting to all of you Malick and wheat lovers out there, it is not. Yes, there are about 10 or 11 shots in the movie that are beautiful. And I know that Terrence Malick is such a genius that he doesn't need to bother with things like story and dialogue. But--except for the death part--I wouldn't care about these characters and their underdeveloped love triangle if they were my best friends. Every time I thought an interesting conversation was about to take place, the film faded to black and then cut to a train or more wheat. If trains and wheat were sex, then this movie would run very closely to a mid-budget, turn-of-the-century porn. But trains and wheat are not sex, so this movie is boring. Also, if you don't want people to bother you about your possible relations with a certain lady, don't say ""No, guys, really. It's alright. She's my sister."""
1,Poor quality,"Item received in the time specified. It was a poor quality DVD. The picture so dark, you couldn't enjoy the wonderful cinenatography which this movie is known for"
1,Is this art?,"I had no expectations about this movie and am not familiar with the directors, writers, producers, photographers or actors (save Gere). This ""film"" offered pretty scenery though often fake-looking (those barn windows!) and little else.Unforgivable was the running commentary by the young lady mouthing words in her unfathomable accent from a script written by a writer who couldn't find the voice of a world-weary child.Notably, Shepard and the minor characters do a credible acting job causing the lead characters to appear yet even more two dimensional and absent. Maybe as an incentive to keep the audience engaged, Gere is terribly cute throughout -- with his Elvis Presley pout and forelock dangling girlishly over his smooth forehead."
1,"Slow moving, beautifully filmed","I have always been puzzled by this film's legend and status. I saw this at a art cinema when it first came out. I was stunned, absolutely stunned at how bad this film is. I did watch the film to the conclusion, but it was one of the most painful cinematic experiences I have ever had. It was the visual equivalent of having teeth pulled with no anesthetic. It is so slow and painstakingly filmed that I found it excruciating to watch. I have a pretty fair patience with independent films, international films, silent films -- you name it and I can probably find something redeemable. This movie is horrendous. Run, do not walk to the nearest exit!"
4,The most beautiful film I have ever seen.,"The story is not done in a dramatic style, but is viewed from a distance, with an atmosphere of realism, regardless of what real life actually is. But the real great thing about the movie is imagery - there is no comparison as far as sheer visual beauty.Unfortunately, the imagery cost the movie bigtime. A lot of the effect came from shooting the film at only certain hours of the day, and if you can only film for a few hours a day the bill for keeping up the production crews, cast, and rent mount up high. This movie was unable to recoup it's immense cost, which is why Malick made no more movies for a long time, and part of why these kind of movies will not be made often. So enjoy this gem!"
3,"A STUDY ABOUT THE GREED, LOVE AND ENVY OF THE HUMAN BEINGS.","*** stars rating for this film. ""Days Of Heaven"" is a drama set in the early years of the 20th century, starring are a very young Richard Gere, Brooke Adams, Sam Shepard & Linda Manz. The movie was carefully directed by Terrence Malick. The most heralded part of this movie is the cinematography, which presents wide fields, farms and landscapes, besides a good costume work and good music.The plot of this movie becomes more and more interesting gradually. The movie basically is a tale about the greed and ambition of the human being and all the tricks and misdemeanors that the people can do in order to get money and properties. Also in the game appear feelings like love and hate, and the envy. ""Days Of Heaven"" is an interesting movie."
3,"""Days of Heaven""","""Days of Heaven"" is about a man, Bill, who worked in a steel mill in Chicago. When he accidentally killed a man, he ran away to a wheat farm in the Texas pan handle with his girlfriend, Abby, and sister, Linda. But the story is not the important part of this movie.This movie shows a great contrast between nature and humans. Before the harvest, you see beautiful wheat fields and animals running free. Then, when the harvest begins there are giant machines cutting down the wheat and destroying the homes of many animals. Also, these machines are pumping out tons of exhaust into the air.There is also a great look at human nature in this movie. When Bill and Abby try to con the farmer into getting all of his money, it ends up making things worse for them. The swarm of locusts shows how much power nature has over people. Its almost as if nature is punishing Bill and Abby for trying to con the dying farmer."
5,Beautiful.....,"This has been my favorite film, for as long as I can remember. Everything about it is masterful, incredible cinematography, enchanting score, amazing performances. Highly recommended"
3,VVVVEEEERRRRYYYY SSSSLLLLOOOOWWWW.!! MAYBE THE SLOWEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN.,"Yes, VISUALLY it is EXQUISITE. The acting is good. It's set in the early 1900'S. It's about poor people trying to SCRAPE a living. There is a love story, of sorts, but it's WEIRD. The movie is narrated by a young girl with a HORRIBLE Brooklyn accent. And, it's very, very slow.I do not understand the praise. I could not, in good conscience, recommend this movie. SLOW, SLOW, SLOW, and not in a good way!I gave this movie 3 stars, but that is VERY GENEROUS. For the most part, there, barely, is a plot. The movie is, almost, about NOTHING. I can't say the movie is character driven, because the characters are barely fleshed out. NO WAY JOSE."
4,Mood Movie with Great Cinematography and an Unsatisfying Ending,"Days of Heaven is best on a big screen, as the naturalistic cinematography is incredible. I used to think Richard Gere was just a pretty face until 19 years ago when I saw this movie and his raw talent. I found the ending unsatisfying and wanted to rewrite it, but I had a hard time forgetting this movie."
4,Beautiful,"It's beautiful, and I'm not just talking about the visuals. The film does an excellent job of telling a story; story is an element left out of so many box-office smashes today, but it's certainly present in ""Days of Heaven."" Just as ""The Thin Red Line"" tells a story before showing a war, ""Days"" makes the storytelling its main goal. Worth the money."
1,fell apart on first day of play,"With regular playing, within one hour the grappler ( the thing that holds the bale in the bucket) fell off and won't stay on. The parts to the bucket keep coming off. We've spent more time putting it back together than my son has had playing with it."
2,Not Meant for Play!,"Our son is in love with all things tractor and so we got this for him for Christmas. Sadly, it falls apart insanely easily. The wheels pop off, the baler is wonky, etc. He adores his tractor so even though it's in a sad state he won't allow it to be removed from his room. We hope to find a better option that is made more durable (this one is mainly plastic which surprised me)."
1,Very disappointing,"Do not waste your money on this toy. We've owned it for 2 days and it's already fallen apart. The wheels pop off every time my boys play with it. The bale mover has come apart at every connection point multiple times, and now won't stay together even when we try to reassemble it. I've had good luck with ERTL toys in the past, but this is just cheap plastic junk."
1,Keeps falling apart,every time my son plays with this tractor something falls off of it. would not recommend this toy.
3,Looks better than it is.,The tractor is really nice. My 3 year old son loves it. He was very frustrated with the bale mover part. The Bale mover is plastic and could easily be broken. My son just wanted the bale mover off so he could play with the tractor. The tractor is made well.
1,This doesn't deserve one star,"I should have heeded the poor reviews, but this is worse than expected. The pieces started falling off immediately, including tires. It's a bother to return things like this, but I'm going to because of the price. This is a Dollar Store toy! Seriously bad."
2,"Disappointing, shoddy quality","My son was so excited to receive this, but it lasted only a few days with non-rough play. Much of this vehicle, including three tires and multiple areas of the part that holds the hay bale, simply broke off. Sadly, it quickly became unusable and we ended up purposely removing all the tires and repurposing them and the hay bale for other vehicles to load/unload."
2,Flimsy POS,"My 2yr old adores this toy that breaks if you look at it wrong. He walks around with it saying ""dad fix"" which would be fine except it is composed of way too many easily separated parts half of which are lost."
2,JD Bale Mover,"Prompt delivery on the toy, made mostly of plastic and 2-pieces broken within 30/min of opening gift on Christmas, one on bale mover, just by moving it and the other was the hitch after attaching a rotor mower to it and pulling for maybe 10/min. Great toy, just needs to be make more sturdy for childrens enjoyment."
1,This is not what you're looking for.,Do NOT buy this product by mistake if you are looking to improve your suturing skills. It is NOT an excerpt from Anne Frye's book; it is a review only.
1,This is NOT the actual text,"I was so excited to click and download this book that I didn't look at the reviews either. It should be clearly stated at the top of the page that this is NOT the actual text! Those of us who seek this book are not looking for reviews, as we know the quality and value of this classic."
3,VHS How to Video,This is an advanced video on how to setup and run a garden railroad. It is fun to watch. I got several great ideas from it. My wife enjoys gardening and I enjoy model trains so I thought it would be a natural blend of our hobbies so we could spend more time together.
5,Red Green Rules,This movie is a must for any Red Green fan from the T.V. series.The jokes are very funny and Canadian viewers will have to be on the lookout for many inside jokes. I recommend it highly.
2,Not the Same as the TV Show,"I have always enjoyed the ""Red Green"" TV show, which one of the local PBS stations broadcasts once a week. Frankly, I was disappointed in the movie. The concept just didn't translate well to a longer format. Despite an imaginative ending, the movie had little of the zany inventiveness (ie, inventions) of TV."
3,Red Green's Duct Tape Forever,"As funny as the TV series. Warning - the DVD is promoted as providing 1.85:1 aspect ratio, ideal for widescreen HD TVs, but the image size is inexplicably reduced in size and does not fill the screen, leaving an annoying letterbox frame on all sides. The DVD does not provide any setup options to correct this."
2,Why? Why? Why?,"First of all, I would like to say that Red Green is one of my favorite comedy TV shows of all time, along with Seinfield. It pains me to write a two star review about a movie with Red Green's name on it. It had some good humor thrown into certain scenes, but the comedy was mostly non-existant. The plot is actually pretty good and everything made sense, there was just not enough humor. Here's another thing I noticed, it's like this movie was made so you can spot ""The Lucky West Virginians."" I live in West Virgina, and PBS really made a big deal out of it. I have a few suggestions, RENT THIS MOVIE FIRST, THEN BUY IT IF YOU LIKE IT(I saw it on TV, thank god)! Also, stick with the older seasons of Red Green(anything with Bill is good) and just ignore the newer seasons since they lost all the intelligent humor they once had in the older seasons."
4,A good laugh with Red Green,The movie was not as great as the television series but was good for a laugh. A must have buy for any fan of the show.
4,"Well done, witty script, fresh, funny stuff.","I loved the Red Green Show years ago, and now loved the movie as well. The show had a sense of quick bits, the movie by its nature has a longer story played out. They did a good job with this and on a low budget (3.5 million). I especially liked watching interviews with the characters, when they are themselves, out of character. Especially the actor who played Harold. Wow. There are a number of quick wit lines in this movie, listen for them, don't miss them."
4,Surprisingly good,"I was not expecting much after reading some of the reviews but as a Red Green fan, we thought we'd give it a try. We were pleasantly surprised and it was much better than we anticipated. Steve Smith took the characters (all of them, with the exception of Rick Green!) from the Red Green show and created a long comedy bit that actually flowed, made sense and was humorous. He pulled it off well without digressing from the original Red Green show format. Kudos to the writing. And it was good to see all the normal TV show characters involved. Others give the general plot format so I will not repeat it here. There are however maybe a half dozen places which are somewhat crude and could have been left out but that too can be said of the Red Green TV series as well. It is only for that reason that I give it a ""4"" instead of a ""5"". If you are a Red Green fan then this is highly recommended."
4,"Good movie, average shipping","This is a great movie, especially if you are a fan of the show. However, when I received the movie, the case was cracked so bad that it couldn't be closed. Luckily the disc was okay so I just swapped the case."
3,Way out there but way funny!,"I love the Red Green Show, and when I learned that they had made ""Duct Tape, the Movie"" I just had to have it. It is all about the guys at Possum Lodge entering a contest using Duct Tape. It features all of the regular wacky guys and was actually written by Steve Smith (Harold)."
4,"Funny, but not like TV show",This show is very good and I enjoyed it. It's not quite as funny as the TV show is though.It has the usual Red Green humor in it.
5,water filter,I have had a hard time finding this filter at the local stores. Decided to try amazon. Amazing was very simple to order and received it in a few days. It was a perfect fit.
5,very good water filter,"I substituted the sediment filter in the Omni OT-32 under the counter water filter system with the GAC1-SS water filter and this filter along with the Omni water filter CB3-SS6-05 delivers great tasting water! Central Florida has terrible water, it is hard and can contain a lot of sulfur and calcium causing lime deposits and discoloration. All of this is eliminated with this filter."
5,It works great!,Put it on and we immediately got different taste of water. It's wonderful. It's a little bit pricey considering the shipping cost though.
1,omni filtration system tested poorly,I have been using the omni water filtration system and thought it was doing a good job until I tested my water. I found it had more sediment than my tap water. I replaced the filters and there's no improvement. I'm switching to an R/O system.
4,You'll never drink plain tap water again.,"I have been using the Omnifilter for several years and it significantly reduces or elimates unwanted odors and sediment from tap water. My family will not drink plain tap water anymore. Food and drinks prepared with water from the Omnifilter have much better flavor as well.The filter cartridge is inexpensive and a breeze to change. The expected life of the filter is 3 months for the GAC1 and 6 months for the GAC2. I have found these to be accurate estimates, although you may see different results depending on the contaminate level of your water and the amount of water you use.You'll notice a slight decrease in water pressure when it's tame to change filters.It's an excellent product!"
2,A printed version of an online travel journal ....,"... but without the pictures. After I received this mildly entertaining book I realized it was a printed version of material that I read on a website (the author's, I presume) a couple of years ago. It's basically like reading someone's online journal about his trip abroad--we ate here and I had the lasagna and then we had gelato there and I had this flavor and she had that flavor and then we locked ourselves out of our hotel room and we really liked this hotel in this city at this address, etc. The author and his wife seem like nice and amusing people, but this book would probably be enjoyed most by those who are planning their first trip to Italy. I did enjoy very much his snarky but good-natured remarks about Rick Steves and Frances Mayes."
2,A travel log rather than a guide,"This self-published book is composed of apparently previously published web articles on the author's travels to Italy. The structure is not cohesive, jumping around between trips and towns. There are numerous grammatical and typographical errors throughout. The continual mention of each meal consumed was tedious and boring, as no real restaurant review was given, just a mention such as ""I ordered the Pizza Margherita; she ordered the arugala pizza"". I wouldn't consider it a guide but a personal trip report, something you listen to at a dinner party, but not something worth paying money to read about."
2,Not correct,"I found this book with many misleading remarks. The author tells the reader to go to McDonald's to use their ""American"" bathrooms. Not true! In Italy you cannot just drop into McDonalld's to go to the loo. You need to buy something and then get a coin from the cashier to open the door. I had the feeling this book was poorly researched.After 2 or 3 trips to Italy how can you think you can write a guide book? I got very bored with the author's telling of his jet lag!. Then go to bed upon arrival and get over it!"
2,returned,This is not a rare piece. I bought it at Kmart. The singers undoubtedly have great skills but it seems to me they are justing performing for performing's sake. There is little passion in the music.Good stuff for relaxing and yard work. Not for true Webber lovers.
3,Not too bad,"I collect ALW and musical stuff, so I've heard a lot of ALW. This is a great CD, and the singers are really talented, but I really wish they had gotten someone else to do the POTO songs. Whoever does the Phantom (Justin White, I think?) did a REALLY BAD job, and the Christine (I think it's Margueritte Krull) isn't too swell, either. They do great on other songs, but it was just plain WRONG. This CD was just cursed when it came to Phantom songs. The Overture wasn't that good, either.But all the other songs are wonderful. I love Rainbow High from Evita. If you're shopping for ALW and don't care if Phantom was messed up, then go ahead and get this CD."
1,This would be a good song if...,"This would be a good song if it wasn't total rip on ""All or Nothing"" by O-Town. Listen to the intros of both songs. Notice anything. Yup, the BSB has the same intro as O-Town only in a different key. Then, as you listen, you can probably notice where you could fit in the words of ""All or Nothing"" where the lyrics of ""Drowning"" are being sung.Sure, it has great lyrics, but it's a ripoff musically. Plus, it's got the Backstreet Boys who manage to whine on EVERY song they do! Don't buy this cd and when it comes on the radio, change stations!"
3,a must for van cleef fans!,Gods Gun has a good storyline and a good musical score. There are also a lot of familiar faces and Jack Palance is terrific as the villain!! Worth a look.
2,I wish I could say it's so bad it's good but I can't,"I'm not going to do a synopsis of the plot here. I can only tell you that we were practically falling on the floor laughing when we stumbled upon this turkey while watching TV late last night.After all, whatever it is that makes a bad movie entertaining even if it's only for just a few minutes this movie has got it- the cast, the soundtrack, the hokey sets and sound, it's all here. At one point we turned the sound off and pretended that it was a movie performed by The Village People! For that reason I'm giving it 2 stars. One for the movie and one for me."
1,Don't waste your money,"With a cast list including Lee van Cleef, Jack Palance and Sybil Danning you'd expect at least a decent movie. But ""God's Gun"" fails in everything. Even the stars deliver substandard performances and the ""story"" is completely incoherent. The only good thing about the movie is the soundtrack by Sante Maria Romitelli.Don't waste money on this movie. The good news is that this movie is in the public domain so if you MUST see it you can legally download it for free."
3,Classic western story with a twist,"The classic western story of revenge for an evil done long before. Best served cold as the old adage goes. Only in this one, the one shelling out revenge has a gimick that gives the movie its title; but I give away too much. Not a great film for acting but a couple of classic western actors almost pull this one above average on occasion. Spaghetti westerns need to be judged in their context, I think. This one is not one of the worst though it is certainly not one of the best either. The story is interesting with redeeming qualities - there I go again giving away too much."
1,once again,"This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen (right below ""Green Slime""). Ever a big Richard Boone fan: he is forgiven in this movie. Jack Palance: not believable, no matter what role except ""City Slickers"" where his persona, a dead cowboy playes true. Lee Van Cleef ever steely eyed, ever smooth talking is the only reason to see this film. The downfall, and major blunder, was to cast an amature (immature) to the film: preteen hearthrob Leif Garret. ""Thankfully"" throughout the video he is a mute boy but his acting skills, I give this flick a 1"
5,Can I Say Fantastic?,"This book is an excellent way to learn how to configure and use Windows XP from basics such as desktop, files, multimedia (playing and creating), setting up an internet connection and outlook express to more advanced topics such as networking. Between the pictures and the simple verbal description you are never at a loss to figure out what to do. Also it's simplicity can be misleading. It tells you about the windows built-in firewall which you can turn on or off--I keep it on because it never causes me any problems--as well as the great built-in fax program which you can install without using the Windows CD. I have been using this fax program and it works very well, but I could not find it mentioned in the index of Microsoft's own ""Windows XP Inside Out"" book. I can strongly recommend this book. It is excellent for the average user. I have used other books in the ""Master"" series and they are all excellent."
2,Master Visually Windows XP,"I had purchased Teach Yourself Windows 98 Visually and thought it was great so I purchased Master Visually Windows XP. I was very disappointed in the presentation and content. In addition, the book weighs enough to cause a hernia. What on earth happened? Also I paid $40.00 which I feel is a gross overpayment. This will obviously fall on deaf ears but I thought I would get it off my chest"
3,Misleading title,"Even though I purchased ""Video Games Live [Blu-ray]"" I ended up getting ""Video Games Live: Level 2 [Blu-Ray + DVD Combo]"" instead. I didn't really complain because I was going to buy that anyway, but if you already have, stay clear of this one."
3,"NOT a fake, but...","This appears to be a listing for what is essentially the 'souvenier' version sold at the concert itself; and I happen to have one in my personal collection. The one I have at home does not say 'Level 2'. And it does not include the DVD; it's Blu-ray only.However, it appears to have the same content as the 'Level 2' product, which I'm guessing is the official retail release of the PBS special.That being said, my review of said content is that it is OK. Fun to watch, to be sure, but it doesn't really capture what it's like to be at one of the shows as well as it could have. Would have been better to just record the show, from start to finish, without segments added in breaking up the flow."
4,Solid Little Guitar,"I bought this for my 8 year old daughter, since she always want to play one of my guitars. This is a solid little giutar. It's not a toy. I believe Luna Guitars are produced by Dean Guitars - in the same factory. I won't bore you with techie guitar details - all you need to know for this price is that it stays in tune, feels solid, sounds good and has real playability - even for an adult. And you can draw on it to boot!"
1,Crap,"It's possible that I got a lemon here, but this thing sounds terrible. I tuned it using an electronic tuner so it's deadly accurate, and the guitar still sounds like it has loose strings. The strings bounce off the top fret and bottom fret and sounds very tingy. Again, might have just been a lemon, but it's a major disappointment. I would not put this in the toy category, not musician category."
3,WET ERASE PENS NOT IN PACKAGE...LIKE MOST OTHERS NOTED,Guitar arrived today with no pens. The number one complaint from way too many people. Seems less and less coincidental. Will not order any more items through them. Amazon has always done a great job on every order....maybe they should drop this seller. Tuning up guitar now and it sounds better than expected. Size is good for 10 year old Grandaughter. She will love getting this for Christmas once I buy some additional pens.
1,Do Not Order This Item,Update: due to the excellent customer service at Ace Photo Digital I am getting markers! I would order direct from them and not go through Amazon if you want this product.Do not order this item unless you are willing to buy your own markers. I ordered this after Amazon posted the warning that they are ordering from other vendors because they had a problem with their inventory. DON'T BE FOOLED The guitar I ordered for my daughter also came WITHOUT MARKERS!!! They are misleading you into believing that you will receive the whole product. You probably won't. Amazon should take this product off their site and not mislead consumers.
4,Granddaughter's Christmas present,"Good guitar for a kid... small enough for them to hold and the fact they can draw their own designs on it (which they likely would have done anyway, much to the chagrin of their parents;-). Obviously it is not a high quality guitar but that is why you purchase one like this... you wouldn't put an expensive intsrument into the hands of a small child until they are old enough to take care of it, and also have demonstrated a strong desire to invest the kind of time in practice to make such an invesment worthwhile. I tuned this to an open chord so she could pick it up and strum it with some semblance of musicality. We'll see if it becomes a favorite of hers and if so, down the line I may choose to get her an upgrade. In the meantime, well worth the price, IMO."
4,Not too big or too small,"I have this diaper bag (bought it in-store last summer) and like it very much. It holds a lot of stuff without looking huge... and the styling is very simple and contemporary. The only downside is that the strap isn't adjustable, if it was this would be five stars!"
2,Not for Bad Knees,"The workout was a good workout and was fun, but im very disappionted that i could only do it one time because its bad on my knees. i feel like it was a waste of money. Certain workouts do hurt my knees and this one was really bad.. there are plenty i can do that don't add so much strain on my knees. if knees are not an issue for you, go for it, but be careful with certain moves where u have your knees going past your toes - its not healthy on your knees and there is a move in this video where you drop down low and open your knees while they are wayyyyy past your toes...."
3,"Pretty good, but not as good as some of the other flavors","I bought a couple of different six packs from amazon of the Tasty Bite Indian quick-preparation dishes. This was okay, but was my least favorite. I use them typically as backup food items. ""Nothing to make for lunch? I'll do this."" And also as backpacking food.I notice this flavor is not currently available..."
4,sisqo-you got to get it!,"sisqo's song ""got to get it"" is inspiring! it is an expression of his great talent and individuality, and like he says ""you got to get it! """
1,Constant Problems Printing!,After reading many of these reviews I can see they all have similar problems. Ours started off wonderful. It was easy to use and printed wonderful pictures. Then the paper stopped loading and only half the sheet would be printed on. There were white spots and ink blot spots on the photos. Then the light would come on saying the catridge was empty even when weknew it was brand new. Then we could NOT remove the cartridge so had to break it to remove it. Ours is no longer under warranty and I do not care to pay close to $100 bucks for repair. To be sure Kodak realizes it was their fault we are having these problems and should have done a recall. Shame on you Kodak!!
1,Piece of Junk,"I've had this printer/dock for coming up on a year. It worked well when it did, but I haven't printed pictures in at least 6 months. Well, went to print one today, and not only will it not pull in a pic sheet, but it's telling me to change the cartridge. That is another problem. It's not ejecting from the machine, and I can't get it out.I replaced a prior Kodak printer dock with this one, thinking it was a better made product, but I was wrong. I will never, ever buy a Kodak printer dock again. Period!!!!! This is the second one that wound up costing me more than it's worth. I could have had tons of pics made up professionally for what I've put out with these two printers. Yuk."
1,Kodak screwed us,Kodak screwed us. They don't make cartridges for the EasyShare G600 printer dock anymore. Unable to find if the G610 is compatible.
1,Not worth the high price.,"When it works, it is great!!! But it requires me ""hand-feeding"" the printer paper. It was a gift and won't tell the giver that they gave me junk. I will continue using it and doing the manual feeding but if you are looking to purchase - look elsewhere!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Kodak EasyShare,This Kodak EasyShare G600 Printer does not work with the camera I purchased it for. I need to return it. Would you please give me the necessary information to do this. Thank you.
1,Unreliable,"When I first received this printer it worked great. About 50 prints later, it's a piece of junk. The automatic feed feature has stopped working. The pictures often have one or two white flecks where no color is printed. I keep the paper and printer clean, so I feel the problem is internal. In my opinion, this printer is not reliable and definitely not worth the price!"
1,Worst at home printer - EVER!,This printer was given to us as a gift and worked fine the first time. It hasn't worked the way it is supposed to since. Every time I go to print pictures it gives me problems and maybe I walk away with one printed picture after struggling with it for an hour. The paper will not feed into the printer (we use Kodak paper that came with it) so you spend all your time trying to get the printer to take the paper. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
3,G600 Problem with paper feed,"I had the first easyshare printer, & wore it out for 4 years. I got this one for Christmas with the new Z1275 Camera. I used it for Christmas pics & it was fine. I started to print out some wedding photos I took in April & kept getting the add paper. I added paper, flipped the paper put the tray in & out many times. Still got the add paper. I emailed Kodak with the problem & am still waiting for an answer. If you buy it, dont buy it from Kodak. If they fix it, I will have to mail it to them. Added expense & added time that I dont have it."
1,I would give it zero stars if that was an option,"I've had various incarnations of the Kodak Printer dock. My wife loves the easy transfer and charging abilities. However, this one was the cheapest and lasted 91 days (you know, just outside of the warranty period.) The paper feeding mechanism failed, so I have to force the sheets through - which is hit or miss. The ""portable"" feature is silly - as this is designed to work with a computer and camera. I guess if you really need your pictures on vacation, you can take it with you. I will give the next model a shot (G610) as it looks a little more sound and is similar to the original printer docks."
1,"Totally Unreliable, Don't Buy It!","I bought this printer as part of a printer/camera bundle for my wife. The camera is fine, but the printer is extremely unreliable. It is extremely sensitive to the amount of paper in the tray, and the pick-up rollers that pull the sheets into the printer head very often don't pick up the paper so you have to fuss like crazy to get to work. I'd honestly say that it works about 50% of the time. The prints are OK, not super sharp (when you can get it to print). I've brought it back to Best Buy twice because I bought the extended warranty... and I've decided to return it for a store credit. They have recently introduced a G610, but I don't know if that corrected any problems. This printer is very appealing up front, but we're just not thrilled that it's not at least 90% reliable."
2,bad product,"i got the printer dock just last chritsmas and was very happy with it. it printed amazing quality and was very easy to do. after a few months it got really jammed up and took in 2 pieces of paper at once. i thought it was my fault because the paper was stuck to the other paper and i diddnt seperate them before. i went to the store and they replaced it no problem. then today i finally found out how to print off the computer (wich even on eseyshare it thought it was a normal 8 1/2x11 and only printed part of the picture) when i got it right it got jammed up AGAIN with only one paper too! once is okay, just a small problem, easy to fix but twice in a row with 2 different printers i think it is just a poor design. the people with good reviews probably only had it for a short while or was lucky enough to get one that worked. this is a bad product i am getting my money back!"
2,Kodak Easy Share G600 printer dock,"Intially, the printer worked just great and the pictures always turn out great when it works. After printing less than 10 pictures, it stopped working when the printer ink (film) stuck to the picture. The ink cartridge wouldn't come out and the pictures wouldn't come out either as the ink film was stuck to the picture. I finally just tore it all out and hoped for the best. I replaced the ink cartridge and tried printing several pictures and they came out blurred. I let the printer set for a couple of weeks and thought I'd try it again and it worked fine and has continued to work ok.I had one of the old printers that I threw away as Kodak was charging a repair fee that was equal to the cost of a new printer. That printer had less than 20 prints made and was pure junk. I didn't learn my lesson as I have always liked Kodak."
4,Nice & Simple,"I bought this item in my last trip to US and it works perfectly. The cartridge will only print the exact same # of pictures that it is designed for and the only con I can think of is that in order for the cartridge to work, you have to twist one of the sides with your finger (haven't think of anything else) to get the ink ribbon in place for it to start printing and it's pretty hard to do so my finger hurt for a while. Other than that, this printer works like a charm."
1,Kodak G600 Waste of time and Money,I recently purchased the G600 printer dock and haven't even gotten to try it out yet--the print cartridge that came with it didn't work. I ordered another and inserted it and it still doesn't work. It constantly tells me the cartridge is empty and needs replaced. Lots of time and money involved in this mess---stick with HP!!
1,"Like a new boyfriend... Great, at first...","I too experienced a great start with the printer dock,great clear prints with a fabulous coating... but soon, it started misfeeding... this Kodak printing dock is a very frustrating device. Then it only started printing part of the picture...Kodak tech says it needs to be sent in... the fee for repair, plus shipping is $90.95. Reading the reviews of others shows me that this is not a good design... perhaps it is too humid here in Hawaii, but I wasted a lot of paper trying to get it to print. I will be using the dock as a charging device for the camera, and will have to print using my regular printer. I was going to purchase another dock, but I believe I will experience the same problems before long."
2,"Wisdom, look at the cover","The cover should tell everyone about the 'wisdom' of Islam, a Burka/Abaya wearing woman, her husband not in the picture is happy to see his wife in Purdah while he puts on Jeans and western wear. The essense of Islam is in Sura 4:34 where the beleiver is told to beat his disobedient wife. This is the wisdom. The Wisdom is in the passages ordering the beleiver to kill off the pagans? The passages that glory in booty, that describe sex with slaves. Is this wisdom. Sufism is a nice ideology, however one cannot escape the central tenants of Islam. The central intolerance, and hatred. It is a tragedy, Sufis generally would like to present the wiser, gentler side of Islam, but in the end how can one be taken in by the wisdom of a call for world domination under theocracy?Seth J. Frantzman"
4,Life Saver,"This product has helped keep dog alive for months. He had a bleeding tumor that could not be treated and this has been one of the treatments that has prolonged his life and given it quality. Easy to use, great service from this company. Thank you!"
2,Watch out may cause clotting!,Bought these for my dog after reading about many people having great results with dogs with heart issues or bleeding. My dog had a violent seizure!! These capsules may cause clotting. Do not give to a dog with heart problems. It almost killed my dog.
5,Yunnan Baiyao,I bought this for my dog and it really seemed to make a difference. My pup's oncologist had recommended it and I am glad we got it for her.
5,Really works,"I had a bad laceration on the bottom of my foot, I broke open one of the capsules and rubbed the powder over my cleaned wound before bed. I went to bed that night around 6 pm and got up around 7 am the next day and the wound was nearly completely healed over."
2,Not Silver??,"I don't think that this ring is truly sterling silver. Maybe its just plated. After wearing mine for a little over month, it began to tarnish. I thought that was normal and that it just needed cleaning until a week later when the silver had rubbed off and exposed a white colored metal. I was so disappointed because I really like the look of this ring and I got lots of compliments on it. Mind you, this only happened with the actual band of the ring. The crown hasn't turned color at all. I'm in the market for another crown ring but I'm still wearing this one in the meantime."
3,the item is good but looks used,"It arrived on time and whithout a scratch... but with no box, just wraped in bubble plastic so it looks cheap, not was i expected for a gift to my daughter. it also was dirty so between the no box issue and the dirt it made it looked used. :("
5,I LOVED it!,"Friends of mine have been trying to get me to see this film for months!!On Memorial Day, 2005, I decided to see this film before it left the Embarcadero Theaters in downtown San Francisco.What a miracle.This film is a 'feel good'--'cry your eyes out'--'uplifting slice of life' that rarely gets celebrated in our culture.I found this film to be 83 minutes of goodness that just sort of accidentally happened--It is fun and healing....sounds like the best kind of miracle to me!(I'm not going to add to the story line here....because I'm glad that when I saw the Film I knew very little about it's details.)"
4,Wonderful movie for bird lovers,A flock of parrots live in San Francisco and the story is about a guy (Mark Bittner) who fell in love with them. He names them all. He can tell them apart either by coloring and features or behavior. One he was especially liked was Connor. I found myself engrossed in Connor myself just by Mark's storytelling. Mark would study the birds yet like to make his own versions of their lives around his favorites.Mark is quite a character too. Sort of a modern day hobo. A likable person not some wacko. Just someone who doesn't want to be part of the career building world most Americans follow. I found his relationship with the birds moving at times watching this film.This is a great movie and it's something that older children can enjoy too.
5,A wonderful experience,"Thanks to Judy Irving for making such intelligent documentaries. The Wild Parrotts of San Francisco is not only a wonderful movie with splendid photography, it is also moving and funny . You discover a wonderful segment of the population of Telegraph Hill that cares deeply about the parrots and the man who takes care of them. Danielle"
5,wild parrots of telegraph hill,Great true story of a man making an amazing discovery of wild parrots living in city environment. Rags to riches and a tearjerker as well. This documentary has had an impact on public awareness with regard to how one action by one person can change an entire species
5,great movie,this film will make you laugh and cry. it is the best documentary i've seen in quite some time. if i say anything more i will give away the ending!
5,"Lovely portrait of an odd, wonderful pocket of magic","This is a wonderful movie about the overlay between nature and civilization, which quietly suggests that there isn't really much division between the two... As seen through the eyes of a humble, Zen-oriented bird-lover, the growth of a colony of runaway parrots in the San Francisco hills reveals both sadness (in their having been stolen from their native jungles) and beauty (in their thriving, cacophanous existence) and the wisdom in accepting what nature has to offer, both magical and grim. The original theater release is augmented by extensive bonus materials that really flesh out the history of the flock, both before and after the original film was made. Utterly fascinating."
4,Parrot enthusiasts rule the roost...,"The birds are the stars of this beautiful film, but they are adequately reviewed by other people on this page. Thus, I will comment on the caretaker of the parrots, Mark Bittner. As a longtime Northern Californian, I can point out with some certitude that he is a somewhat unique example of the wonderful type of person you can only find in the Bay Area.During a conversation with someone like Mark, you dismiss him as a nutcase in the first minute. Then for the next five minutes, you realize that he has a gentle and open soul, and you have great sympathy for him. You continue having this whipsaw effect while around him, because he is so sweet and wants to make the world better, but he also might strike some misguided souls as inimitably directionless.So to this animal lover, the parrots and their human were equally fascinating."
5,The Rain Forest comes to the Bay,"The subject is intriguing, The birds amazing and the videography is incredible and it is overall fascinating."
1,Not entertainment; not good education.,"This movie went for an emotional hook, but it fell flat. I did not learn anything about parrots. There was no story line."
1,Extremely boring film,"I don't want to go into detail because it really isn't worth it. My wife and I started this with high hopes based on the number of five-star reviews, but boy, was this boring. We didn't enjoy watching this man--who was focused on more than the birds--and we gave up on the film even though we rarely do that. We're both astonished at the number of five-star reviews here--this is rated as high as the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy! We found it tedious and annoying."
3,Gimme a break,Is this suppose to be a story about the birds....or a story about some 30-something guy who refuses to get an actual job? It was almost laughable watching this guy stumble through life surviving on what other people give to him.
1,Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill,"I guess if you are looking for a movie about parrots you already have a list of other problems. This movie is terribly slow, borderline boring and the music is just unbearable. I would not waste your time."
1,Too bad this isnt all about the birds,"I had such high hopes for this video. What should have been extra bonus features ended up being (and ruining) the video. Instead of focusing on the birds, it focused on an old hippie who showed how he was a bum living off of others instead of working. We also saw how and why the photographer got into her living...ok nice, but I really didnt buy this to see her life story. Again, this should have been left in the bonus features.They didnt focus on the birds hardly at all. You really didnt learn much about them. Honestly, a total waste of money unless of course you like seeing a bum shave because some photographer fell for him. Yeah, I really dont know what that had to do with the parrots of Telegraph Hill either."
1,This ain't Paulie,"If you want to see a movie about a bird story, then watch Paulie - Paulie was wonderful parrot story. This on the other hand, glorified this person who refuses to earn a living and yet has a better life living off the kindness of others than some families that have jobs in the real world. I made it to the end of the movie but was very disappointed. I totally agree that this is not a kid's movie."
5,world's best anti-depressant; no side effects,"this litle gem of a movie was sitting quietly in my neighborhood independently owned video store....it was the 27th rainy day in a row in Cotati, California and I thought seriously of getting in my car and fleeing to Mexico forever. My eyes fell on this movie and for whatever reason I took it home, put it on, and I know this sounds like hyperbole- but it changed my life.I sold my house, bought an R.V., and began to lead the sort of life I was always supposed to have lived. I think it was because of Mark Bittner- I think it was because of Connor- the wonderful blue headed Conure I so identify with, but if a movie can free a person's soul-this was the gift I received.Thank you Judy Irving, Thank you Mark Bittner- you'll never know what you have done for me."
5,This movie made me cry.,"I love this movie. The story beneath the documentary really touches your heart. I love Mark, he seems like such a gentle soul."
4,Funny and touching gem of a movie!,"This is a wonderful documentary. There is much to recommend it:the lovely eccentric Mark Bittner; the gorgeousness of the City and the openness and generosity of those who live there; and most importantly the parrots themselves.If one has any doubts that animals are like us in so many ways, if we took the time to notice and care, this film dispells them. Mark approaches them with respect. He wins their trust with his authenticity and unwillingness to exploit them. Their personalities shine, distinctive and unique.If one has ever lost a beloved animal friend, he or she will relate to Mark's relaying of an experience of the feeling of emotions and telepathic connection with one of the birds at the time of death. (note: make sure you have Kleenex)A wonderful movie to sensitize the hardened heart to our greatest teachers: nature and the animal kingdom."
4,"DVD does have 5.1 audio, but with a disastrous mistake!","The copy I just received from Netflix DOES have 5.1 audio in addition to 2.0, BUT the 5.1 channels are improperly routed. All the audio that should be coming through the center speaker, including ALL dialogue, instead comes out through the left rear speaker. Completely unlistenable. The 2.0 gets the job done well enough for the dialogue, but it would be nice to hear the music with 5.1 clarity. Since the online rental outfits have already purchased up loads of these initial defective mixes to satisfy initial demand, I doubt online renters will ever see a ""corrected"" DVD available through them, if and when it comes out."
5,A Gem Waiting to be Discovered,The recipient of this video loved it. Don't be afraid of the birds. They are no different from you and me.
4,My cat loves this movie,"I really enjoyed this film, but I wouldn't necessarily need to own it if it weren't for my cat, Elian. He tends to watch TV now and then anyway, but when this film was on, he was in heaven; leaping at the birds on the screen, trying to find them behind the TV, the works. When the price comes down a bit I'll get it for Elian. And I'm sure I won't mind watching it again either. He also loved ""Dirty Dancing"", but he'll have to let that one go..."
4,Mad men 1-3,"I ordered the movie series for Christmas so I haven't view as of this date, but the ordering online and the shipping was very good. Thank-You."
5,Mad Men Seasons1-3,We received our order promptly and it was in perfect condition. It was my first time to use Amazon and I couldn't be more pleased.
5,fans of madmen,"Since we missed the first two seasons, buying these filled in what we missed. None of them disappointed, we're always glued to the content, cigarettes, whiskey and all. they can be watched and be just as entertaining on the second go-round. great characters and intriguing plots."
1,Mom's Video never shipped it. I ordered this item 11/12/11 and still have not received it by 12/15/11,Service by Amazon and Mom's Video is atrocious and I am not getting any satisfaction from anyone. As of now I will not purchase anything else on the Amazon site
4,Stepping back to a different era,"I have enjoyed the series Mad Men very much. Initially when it first came out, I did not watch it. The title threw me off. Acting is very good and the sets are so authentic. I catch myself looking at the cars, clothes etc that I remember from those times. Wish there were more shows like this. Tired of all the supernatural junk and the sitcom so called comedy on tv now. It is refreshing to see actors that are not associated with other series. Did so many people really smoke that much ?"
4,Enjoyed them,"The only complaint I have is that there must have been a scratch or two in one of the discs, but I bought it used and that can happen. Not perfect, but fine."
1,false ad,"i bought this along with 'musician's friend's' guitar pick. i wanted the items to match but the strap is plain black and does not say musician's friend anywhere. as far as the pick, i never got it. i emailed the company but i have not received any word - and that's more than three weeks ago."
2,did not come in color as shown.,these movies did not come in color as shown and was very fuzzy not good quality. but too much trouble to pay to return. but i have learned my lesson.
1,More of the Same,Now Mill Creek has jumped on the Hillbilly bandwagon. I bet this is another release of the same PD episodes which have been circulating on the home video market for years. Sadly it seems like the official season sets have dried up - poor sales????
5,a nearly lost gem,"Brother Dave was a contemporary of Lenny Bruce and Mort Sahl, equally innovative and controversial. He was the first comic who specialized in Southern humor, and set the pattern for many to follow. Unfortunately, he never got the same kind of exposure, especially outside the South, so he's in danger of being forgotten. That would be a serious cultural loss.This 90-minute show, recorded in 1982 less than a year before he passed away, is about as good a compendium of Brother Dave as you can get. All his most noteworthy routines are there, interspersed with random observations about nearly everything, and a few of his musical bits as well -- he could sing and play the drums, too. The remastered DVD is high-quality. My only quibble is that there are only a few index points, so you'll need to figure out where your favorite bits are and fast-forward to them from the nearest index mark -- but that is, as I said, a quibble. Enjoy!"
2,Dave grew old with the rest of us,"Dave was a good old boy back in his time, but time caught up with him and never is it more evident than on this DVD. The jokes are the same ones he has been telling since the 1950's and 60's. A few come off nicely, but a better amount fall flat mostly because of the passing of time. I think seeing it live would have made a great difference in perspective."
4,Great read for young readers!,"""Life on a homestead ranch in Canada proves to be full of surprises for 17-year-old Megan Griffith. The orphanage in which she grew up never prepared her for family life...or for a world full of love.""I read this when I was very young, and I recently read it again, falling in love with it all over again. It follows the story of Megan, a young orphan from Wales who is neither pretty nor frilly, and she immigrants to Canada where she will help out a family on their ranch. She endures the hardship of this new land, and witnesses the growing hostility between the immigrants and the ""english"" in the town. Megan finds friendship with the Andoris family from Poland, especially with the youngest son Anton. She also discovers the love of a family, and what it feels like to be home. The people of this small Canadian town and Megan go on a journey to discover what it is that makes us human and alike, as well as what it means to be a Canadian."
2,"Leaks, Slime and Mold","I have had this unit for perhaps 10 years, finding replacement filters has become a problem, but they are available at a much higher cost. Leaks after filter replacement has always been an issue. The wrench itself does not work satisfactorily and I have to remove the entire filter housing and place it in a vice then beat the wrench with a hammer to get it loosened or tightened. In addition , when I take out the old filter at six month intervals I find the inside of the housing has traces of slime and mold - this is not good, and thorough washing and a final bleach rinse is necessary before inserting the replacement filter.The filteration itself is excellent."
3,little tough to open.,Hand tightening results in leaks and tightening with the enclosed wrench ensures you will need an 800 lb Gorilla to open it. Just make sure to release the water pressure in the filter before trying to open. It will make it much easier. (duh I know) The filters do the job. We have city water so my main concern is removing rust and particles.
2,Not happy,The Jelly Belly beans are always a treat but the shipping gavbe me pause to question not only the purity of the product but they were all stuck together and had to be cooled in the large box prior to repacking to get them apart.Would not buy in this form again.
4,Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World - Season Two,"I highly recommend purchasing ""The Lost World - Season Two"" dvd. Its one of the best Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's television series that I've seen so far."
5,Just GREAT!,"TLW is an awesome show!!! And season2 is my favorite! It's unlike any other TV shows. TLW is different and in a very very good way! :)))I say, AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!!!!!"
4,the lost world season two,product came nicely packed and came much sooner then i expected am very pleased with the item and service one of my favorite shows i am very glad to find these for sale at such a great price
2,The Lost World- Season two,"Season Two is very much like Season One--so, if you liked Season One...If you park realism and common sense outside, this is likable spectacle on something of a budget. This lost plateau is home to virtually endless hostile clans, travelers, and of course dinosaurs (although, where all the food for everyone comes from is somehow never brought up...) But it's fun, so why argue?"
1,The lost world!! One of the best shows out there!!,"If your looking for Adventure, Romance, Science-Fiction, Comedy and more, than you can't go wrong with the lost world. The show is amazing with good special effects and an amazing cast. You'll stay glued to the screen when you see all the amazing things that happen to the lost explorers in this season 2 boxset. I would order yours today!!"
2,DUKE ELLINGTON,"If you prefer seeing Duke with his band, then this is for you. I purchased the DVD with the expectations he would be intimate as the title says. What I mean by intimate is having a trio for the entire DVD. 1/2 of the DVD had a trio, but the songs were extremely slow and lacked variety. THe only song that I really enjoyed with the trio was ""Take The A-Train."" The other 1/2 of the DVD included parts of his band, 1 trombone, 1 coronet, 1 alto sax, 1 tenor sax, and etc. I did not expect this format, because I was looking for more soling opportunities from the Duke. Still, if you want to see him with less of his orchestra then it would be a good buy for you. And if you are a fan of his slower paced songs then consider buying it. It just was not my taste, but I still have utmost respect for Duke Ellington."
3,Dated and not really that entertaining of a show,"Okay, simply the fact that it is Duke Ellington gets three stars. That having been said, nothing else about this video merits any kudos. The lighting was bad (even for the day), the transitions between the tunes were boring, and it was an overall lackluster production."
4,Missing E-Pages,"The book was very enjoyable, but I was frustrated by the fact that the last pages of at least four of the chapters were missing from the download. I have not had this problem with a Kindle download, before, but something is wrong with the transmission of the ""Quilter' Legacy."""
5,Places reader in historical situations,"Again, Chiaverini tells a wonderful story of families. I pictured some of my own ancestors in these historical times through her eyes, especially the 1918 flu and World War I. Eleanor is such a strong character who carved her own life and a good one for her children.I used the family tree in the front of the book to place people from this book and others in my mind. This is a lovely series. I'm on to the next one soon!"
5,One of the best in this series.,"I have enjoyed this series and this may be the best one! Loved the hunt for the missing quilts. Loved the story of Sylvia's Mother. However, I did think the children of Andrew were just WAY overdone and came out looking just silly.You could read this story on it's own, but I think it is best to read the series in order. (This is number 5)"
3,Enjoyable.,"I liked it. The book continues the story of Sylvia, this time as she tries to locate her mother's quilts. As the quilts were sold off by her sister, this involves internet research and travel. Her mother's story is interspersed with Sylvia's quest, which is nice, but the reader learns Eleanor's story, Sylvia doesn't. I wish the author had worked it so that Sylvia learned her mother's history, because that knowledge is something she craves. Overall, I enjoyed it: not quite as much as the others, but it was still good."
3,OOPS!,"Content of the book was good- however, some of the language of all this series could have been improved. It ISN'T necessary to have swearing in order to write a book! I enjoyed all except for that!Elaine Willard"
4,Smalltown boy runs away!,"IF you like this song by Brice then ck out his original follow up...""Close Your Eyes""."
5,ANTHEM REMIXES GALORE,"""Smalltown Boy"" is an anthem of sorts for me and since I couldn't find any satisfactory remixes of the Bronski Beat version, THIS suffices nicely! It can take you back to a time of change...and bring you into those cloudy, foggy nights and mornings on the dance floor!"
3,Great Artists,"Even though this was not my favorite CD by MercyMe, I still enjoyed it. The message their lyrics send is always one of hope and encouragement and the music is always excellent."
5,great CD,Christian music has come a long way since Michael W Smith and Amy Grant! This is a great CD.
2,Not Impressed,"First off I think Bart Millard is one of the best singers I have ever heard. I also really liked Mercy Me's first three albums. However, Coming Up to Breathe doesn't even compare to Spoken For, Almost There, and Undone. After listening to this album all the way through the first thought that popped into my head was ""generic"". What I mean by that is the lyrics. I feel that today in Christian music the lyrics are becoming quite stale. I think Mercy Me has caught I touch of this. I do think however, that they are fully capable of rebounding from this album.So with that said I know that there are a lot of people out there that will disagree with me. I think if you really look at this album you will find that it is not quite as good as you first thought."
3,Misses the mark,"Mercy Me has always had a knack for writing good, catchy material. The underside is that their first couple of albums were pretty hit and miss. On ""Spoken For,"" that problem was finally rectified: the band fully hit their stride with a quality masterpiece. I was incredibly eager for their next release, especially given all the hoopla surrounding it.Sorry, ""Coming Up to Breathe"" is a disappointment. There are still a few likable songs, but the arrangements are cluttered and busy, the lead singer too often strays beyond a comfortable range, and the quality and interest-factor dip as the album goes along.The upshot is that I still listen regularly to ""Spoken For."" ""Coming Up to Breathe"" on the other hand? Almost never."
2,Coming up to breathe,"The Cd I ordered was in good condition, however the time it took for me to receive the item was past the time they gaurenteed it. Also I e-mailed the people as to where the item was and never got a response back. I would have to say that I will not want to do business with this company again."
4,Good for working on auto,"I bought these to work on my truck. I used them when it was 35 F out to install a new down pipe back exhaust. They did protect my hands. And at that temp they actually keep my hands kinda warm. The padding on the top is not the thickest, but it did prevent bloody knuckles when I used them. I did still feel the impact of the slips, just not the broken skin.Would I buy these again? Yes. But only to work on the Auto's. I would not use them for general purpose gloves. I would not use them for doing demo or construction."
5,Protect your hands!,"These gloves fit great and protect your hands from cuts and abrasions. I have worn these gloves for years and swear by them. The orange color is great, too. Reserve splitting your knuckles for when you absolutely have no choice."
2,Uppity,"I found Miss Manners to uppity, better-than-thou attitude nauseating. Her approach to wedding ettiquette is mainly filled with the question-answer tidbits that one can find in the newspaper and very rarely apply to you. I did not find this book useful. If you want a wedding ettiquette resource, go for Emily Post."
3,The quietness is worth it....in a way,"This is the WITT single which contains the Quiet version of The Day the World Went Away and the Porter Ricks mix, as well as a radio edit version of We're In This Together.The radio edit is good, though it's just not as good as the original. I don't mind this, but it just doesn't have that feel that it was intended to have.The quiet version of TDTWWA is excellent...but doesn't really fit on this single, nor does the somewhat dull Porter Rick's mix. Don't get me wrong, the quiet version is EXCELLENT, but it's already on halo 13, so get that instead.Not bad, not great, just an ok single. Parts 1 and 3 of halo 15 are much better."
3,$70 !!! ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND ???,"Why on earth are the singles from ""The Fragile"" so exspensive ?? They can't possibly worth $70, and I saw the PT.1,and 3 versions of this single going for as high as $99!!!What is wrong with these people? I know that if you buyers do enough searching you can find these cd's for WAY LESS than these prices. REDICULOUS!!!Just do some searching, or try a local used cd store, you can't possibly not find these singles I know because I own a great deal of NIN cd's, I just payed $50 to see them(that was worth the money, I suggest seeing them live if you can). But, do not pay this much money for something you can find for less than $10 somewhere else.-CHRIS"
4,Captures the spirit of the Neville's music.,"Guest stars Bonnie Raitt, Jimmy Buffet & more. Very popular video at my Blues Club. Great stuff!"
1,holy cow,It would have been better if the bear ate the guy so the show could end and save me and that other white man all the misery we suffered until after the credits were over. Imagine that you're fighting for your life in the desert against an Indian and you knock him out. Now you walk off WITHOUT MAKING SURE HE'S DEAD and you leave his machete with him because it would be unfair to be armed if he wakes up and comes after you. Even the libertarians would send a man to prison for making this one.
3,Needs Better Pictures,"I found that the book covered most do-it-yourself repairs but they were mostly in written form. I wanted more and better pictures of what they were describing. Possibly a more descriptive diagrams and photographs of where the internal componenets are, what they're called, and what they look like. Other than that, it gave good advice in written form on how to disassemble and reassemble the working parts of this vehicle."
4,Good basic guide for the Odyssey,"This is a pretty good reference for the shade tree mechanic. It doesn't always get into a lot of detail, but it has some good pictures to help you get your bearings when navigating the engine bay or other parts of the car. I also bout the ""official"" shop manual too and the two together make for a great DIY resource for the Odyssey."
4,Good value for money,"Pros:great for city use, love the ease with the recline feature.. can be done in one hand (unlike the maclaren which needs both hands), basket and umbrella are good size, easy to maneuver, good value for the moneycons: isn't as compact at the maclaren when it folds, heavy to carry when travelling so you may need another light weight stroller for travels."
3,Wrong Answers,"This book is great because it is broken down into sections with review questions at the end of each section. But, I found that there are many math questions throughout the book that have the wrong answers. When you read the rationale it is clear that it does not correspond to the indicated question."
1,Wish I got the book!!!,I ordered and payed for the book and I still have not received it!!!! Don't know where it is or if I will get my money back...... very upset about this.
1,Something off in the translation,"As a board certified nurse practitioner, I find a number of the question- and- answer scenarios in this book to be simply not appropriate( much too esoteric and convoluted) for my friend who is studying to be an RN. Someone wondered if it had been translated from a foreign language. Perhaps. There are better books on the market."
3,wrong size for my husband but it fits me!,I ordered X-LG but received M. I decided to keep them since they're terribly comfy and roomy.(and well-made) If they'd sent the right size then maybe a 4 star!
1,Total crap.,"Crap. Just total crap. Worked on about three occasions, now it won't even turn on. Did I say it was crap? I would have given it zero stars, but that's not an option."
1,a dud,This thing barely worked once opened. Photos are grainy and the camera is complicated for a kid. Not worth the money at all.
1,"A ""must avoid"" kind of book!","This is written by the author of a breezy study of the War of 1812, and now he takes up the subject of the French and Indian War in a popular history that suffers from conceptual problems, uneven coverage of the war's events, and an over-reliance on a fast-paced narrative at the expense of any significant interpretive value--in other words, most of that genre's typical flaws. Even the book's cover presents a problem in that the dramatic illustration is not from the French and Indian War, although this may have been the publisher's decision. Nevertheless, there seems to be an over-reliance on Parkman for details, a preponderance of some very dated sources, and no archival research. Moreover, Indians get left out almost completely. This is a MUST AVOID book, suitable only for those uninterested in interpretation or research. Read anything by Fred Anderson instead."
5,Well Done,"For one who is less than detail obsessed historically, I found Borneman's treatment of the subject balanced and the writing pleasurable to read. I also appreciated the attempt made by the author to separate fact from legend of various important figures of this war. For example: Was there a bit of the poltroon in Washington's character when he showed, at times, more prudence than courage? Was there a bit of the opportunistic scoundrel in Maj Robert Rogers who might have turned traitor had the offer been presented and price been high enough? Was General Wolfe really the genious he's been credited with being or simply fortunate that his focal directives were misinterpreted in the outcome's favor at key moments?All in all, this book is highly recommended."
3,Price???,"About half-way through book.... Very nice.But, am I the only person that feels that the Kindle version should be cheaper than the paperback?What the heck, greedy publishers?"
3,Adequate,"This is an adequate survey of the F&I; War. It's reasonably well-written and does a good job of placeing the conflict in it's larger context. If you're already familiar with the subject, however, you won't find anything new or original here.The one thing that seemed strange to me was the amount of time spent on ""Roger's Rangers"" who, while an interesting historical footnote, were of no real military or historical significance.Recommended (for the neyophite only)."
2,Spend your money on novels.,"If you've read enough mystery novels to be considering writing one, nothing in this book will be new to you. The authors basically offer examples of what has already been done with amateur detectives, which can be useful in its way, but it's no substitute for doing the reading yourself.In addition, the book has a distracting number of typos and spelling errors; for example, the authors--or editors--can't seem to decide whether Frederic Brown's first name should have a ""k"" at the end or not, so they spell it both ways at various points in the book.IMHO, the book's best use is as a reading guide to amateur detective novels--but check it out of the library if you want to use it for that."
4,Some good info,"When I first started reading Amateur Detectives, I felt that it needed much more than it offered, however as I kept reading the book kept getting better and better. As the book starts off, it talks about the history of amateur detectives, which is specifically geared towards detective novelists. I found it fascinating to learn where some very established writers got their inspiration.The biggest (and best) section of this book talks about state and federal weapon regulations. It talks about concealed fire arms as well. It was very interesting to read the different laws per state, and especially interesting to read about my own state. I really have learned a lot about the gun regulations. This section really makes up for the slow beginning of the book."
3,SO-SO PRIOR TO 700BC,"I was looking for much more abour early weapons for a book I'm writing. I've gotten much more from other volumes, many not even with weaponry as their primary focus."
5,If you are interested in Military History buy any version of this book available,"If you are interested in Military History buy any version of this book you can find.As a lifelong student of military history I highly recommend this book. For me it is the ""how it works"" of weaponry and warfare. This book offers excellent diagrams and explanations. I often refer to it when looking for references to arms. Buy it - you will not be disappointed."
4,Surprisingly Good,"It's been awhile since I saw this film. After watching Fight Club(which I didn't particularly like), I was checking out other Ed Norton films and saw this one on the list.Ed Norton absolutely makes this film. Gere is his usual self, meaning just OK, but Norton's performance as Gere's client is fabulous. If you like movies with a twist at the end, you MUST see this one."
2,very average,back during The OJ trial everybody for awhile had a Lawyer&Client type of movie out during that time period.and like the rest of them it was full of Cliches.and Richard Gere's Role is no different.only Edward Norton's role is worth seeing the film.the rest is very Predictable.
1,What was this?,"If you have read the book, forget the movie. Most of the book's plot is missing here, or has been rewritten to suit Hollywood tastes."
3,A Star is Born,"This film is a second rate thriller involving Richard Gere, a prominent Chicago attorney, and his defence of an alter boy in a brutal murder case. The movie is engaging for the most part, although there are annoying subplots that are never fully developed and therefore a drag in the picture. The real action in this picture is the electrifying screen debut of Edward Norton. Norton plays the alter boy, Aaron Stampler, accused of killing the archbishop he worked for. This truely is a stunning performance, that garnered several awards and a best supporting actor nomination from the Academy. Norton gives Stampler so much depth and emotion it is hard to believe he could hurt a flea, let alone be guilty of such a brutal crime, despite the evidence against him. A twist of plot explains this and it would be unfair to spoil it for people who have not seen this movie. Norton is flawless and Gere is solid as ever, so this is a picture people should checkout."
5,PRIMAL FEAR,"It is an awesome, spell-bounding, movie! It gets you from the very beginning to the very last minute. One of the best movies and the best endings I have ever seen. I have watched it THREE times- it is one of my top movies of all times!!!"
5,A Great Movie That Plays With Your Head,"This movie is excellent. Norton became one of my favorite actors in this movie, which is actually similar to his role in Fight Club (another excellent movie). If you think you have this one figured out, you'll be in for a surprise....MUST SEE!"
4,More than just entertainment...,"Leonard Maltin in his review states the film has too many tangents, but that is exactly one of the reasons this film has depth, is convincing as a drama and has more than just entertainment value. For example, one of the subplots very effectively illustrates socio-economic concepts described in Anthony Downs (Brookings Institute senior fellow) book ""New Visions for Metropolitan America"". The audience is offered an opportunity to learn about America's socio-economic problems as well as be entertained by some of Hollywood's best performers."
4,Norton delivers BIG!,"The only reason I didn't give this movie 5 stars, is because they had too many scenes with Richard Gere (who stunk in this movie) and not enough scenes with Edward Norton in them. Norton was the only thing keeping this movie watchable.. He gave such a good performance that I have seen it like 5 times, and still haven't gotten tired of it. The plot is good and so is the script (except for Gere's scenes) but just to watch Norton do his thing is enough for me to buy and watch this movie over and over again! He is definatly one of the best actors I have ever seen. Every movie with him rocks. and so does this one!"
3,Reviews should include notes about Blu-Ray VERSION,"So the movie was good...how about the extras? What about the conversion quality? vs DVD etc. I haven't seen it, someone help!!!"

2,NOTE: This review on DVD features only! ~ NOT the movie.,"The exact same movie, and cover art, on STANDARD SCREEN RATIO, is 2:35:1 ~~But when transferd to Blu-ray(The Hard Evidence Edition) it shrank to a small 1:85:1....I thought Blu-ray was the new cutting edge, giving us the best transfer and improved quality...it seems when Blu-ray first came out they were superior in all ways...But now, just by putting a movie into a Blu-ray case will make it sell better.~ Shure, the visual Quality is definatelly superior,.. no dout! The movie: excellent! One of my favorites, and I am shure there are many of you, that dont care if its ""Pan And Scan"" or super panivision 2:40:1.~~ My self,... I will by pass this Blu-ray release (Hard Evidence Edition), and get just as good a movie but, at an almost double the viewing area of the Blu-ray version.~~ I predict, very shortly the 1:851 Blu-ray will re-rlease in 2:35:1, as some kind of ""Special Edition""...its the old trick, called double dipping!"
2,Maybe I am missing something...,"Perhaps I am just too stupid to 'get' it. Maybe I missed something. I failed to see much merit in this film.The story is simply sensationalistic, involving pornography, multiple-personality disorders (of the Hollywood variety) and mutilation, but all with no discernable point other than to thrill. The characters are flat, the romantic subplot seems disjointed and only quite arbitrarily related to the rest of the plot, and everything seems to be sorely lacking in invention and meaning.Edward Norton does turn in a good performance, but should have saved his acting talents for something worthier."
2,Buy Something Else!,A twisting plot that often sidetracks. The musical score is weak. A gloom and doom movie all the way. Very little to cheer about and when the movie is over it leaves you feeling like you just wasted your time. A good effort at the end to throw a twist into everything.
3,Disappointing.,"I was disappointed because I'd read so many 5* reviews here on Amazon before seeing the movie, but come on, the best ending ever?!?!?God help you people, I suppose you couldn't work out what would happen in Gothika either? & I bet you struggle to imagine what happens at the end of 'Sleeping Beauty' as well!Anyway, that said, the acting is great, there's no finer actor around than Edward Norton & if I hadn't taken so much notice of all the hype about how amazing this film is then I probably would've given it 4* because of the acting performances.But that ending? I saw it coming most of the movie. Not as quicly as Gothika mind you, I worked out the ending of that movie about 10 minutes in!!"
2,More Hollywood Sleaze,"Again Hollywood uses its facilities to slur the Catholic church in particular and Christianity in general. Gere is the slick, bigshot lawyer who cares little for the truth. To him the end, which is winning his case, justifies the means. No one in the movie is a decent human being. The Catholic bishop who is murdered brutally near the start of the movie is a sexual pervert, presumably murdered by the overgrown altar boy (19 years old) caught fleeing the bloody scene. Gere's legal opponent is the DA Laura Linney, Gere's ex-girlfriend. She is clever too, but not quite as clever as Gere. The ending shows the triumph of evil in a dysfunctional world. If you like movies with no hero and a hedonistic, atheistic theme, you may like this tripe. But it has no surprising twists as some have written here. The ending can be predicted by anyone with a normal functioning brain. The only satisfaction one can get from watching this is Gere's ultimate defeat."
5,Edward Norton is outstanding,This movie is one of those awesome movies that no one has ever heard about. Edward Nortons first movie role and he is unbelievably good.
5,One of the best movies EVER !,"Edward Norton is supreme! what an amazing performance!.. he is this scared boy who make you feel sorry for him, Gere is his defense attorney, Laura Linney plays the nasty prosecutor who wants to put him in jail,.what a great twisted ending,..Watch it!!"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A ridiculous courtroom drama that falls back on every cliche (including multiple personalities, for the love of Pete), Primal Fear hums merrily along but it's by no means a good movie."
5,I've recommended,"I've recommended this film to a number of people and they have all loved it. A ""Who done it?"" starring Richard Gere and Edward Norton that has more twists and turns,plots and subplots than any movie I've seen in a while. If you are an Edward Norton fan,this,I believe is his best work. The movie will keep you guessing."
5,Outstanding -,"Ambitious attorney Martin Vail (Richard Gere) volunteers his services to a vagrant charged with the murder of a Chicago archbishop. Vail is covered in blood and was captured nearby minutes after the crime. Vail becomes convinced that his client didn't do it, then 'realizes' multiple personalities are involved, and the client's other personality did it. Eventually, the client is sent off for psychological evaluation and a likely limited sentence. Much better than the death penalty.Except that at the end, Vail realizes he's been conned and he's gotten a guilty man off. (Reality - I doubt it. He would have ensured that the state-evaluation would have reached the proper analysis, and at least jailed the killer for life.)"
1,Movie did not work,I purchased this movie on DVD so I would have it in my movie library as it is one of my favorites. I did not decide to watch it until 3 months after purchase. This was my mistake. The movie does not work and it was a waste of money. Very disappointed that someone would sell you a DVD that looks perfectly fine but then doesn't work when it comes time to watch it.
1,Primal Fear,Could not get this DVD to play on my machine. Tried all the available screen formats and it still would not play. This item will be returned!
1,Bad ending,"I do not like this movie, especially the end. After watching it, I threw it to the trash can right away."
1,You gotta be kidding!!!,"This is a great movie with interesting plot twists?? I groaned throughout this movie. So predictable....the egotistical lawyer, his ex-lover DA, the dialogue, the acting....ughh. Nothing more than a basic Hollywood formula movie.I will watch this occasionally to remind me what a recycled , done before, same old same old Hollywood type movie and how much I hate them. I guess some people get off on the same old stuff. Well if you don't, I warned you."
4,movie that made Edward Norton a star.,this is the movie that made Edward Norton a star in Hollywood. watch his Oscar nominated performance as an alterboy accused of murder.
5,Primal Fear,This movie is very suspenceful through - out Keeping you very intriged with a surprise twist in the end. Every actor plays their role well in this movie exept for Edward Norton's debut. I think he steals the show. This movie is one of my favorite all - times.
3,Major flaw in plot,"The ending which is central to the plot is highly questionable. How is it that neither the hot-shot lawyer and his team nor the smart prosecutors never investigated what kind of individual the accused really was? None of them talked to people he interacted with regularly before the murder (friends, acquaintances, colleagues, etc). That's why only 3 stars."
4,A movie that will have you saying WOW!,"In my opinion, this movie was Edward Norton's best performance (yes, even better than Fight Club). For a movie that will really leave you stunned, this is one great movie!"
3,"Instead of watching the movie, go read the book.","The movie was a very sorry adaptation of a great book. If you want to know how this movie should have been made, go read the book. It is much better."
4,"A more than solid thriller, with a twist","When I had first laid eyes on Primal Fear on pay-per-view years ago I had first dismissed at as another Hollywood who-done-it courtroom drama with no originality. And was I ever wrong. Primal Fear may seem like something you've seen before, but the clever, highly intelligent, and twisting script makes the film soar to unexpected heights, and Edward Norton's breakout performace as murder suspect Aaron has to be seen to be believed (Norton would receive a Golden Globe and his first Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actor which Cuba Gooding Jr. ended up winning for Jerry Maguire). Richard Gere has the starring role playing Norton's lawyer who seems to be the only one who believes Norton's innocence. With a super twist ending and a superb all star cast which includes Laura Linney, Frances McDormand, Steve Bauer, John Mahoney, Maura Tierney, and Andre Braugher, Primal Fear is a near superb little gem that I strongly suggest seeing."
5,Ed Norton shines bright in his debut,"What a vehicle for Norton to kick off a career with! A great story with well written characters and a plot twist to send you shivering! (We will ignor the presence of Richard Gere so we may enjoy the movie!) This is the movie that brought the style and sophistication of Ed Norton into my view, and now I'm a huge fan! I believe that Norton is the best young actor we have in Hollywood today. Once you see Primal Fear, you'll be compelled to run out and see American History X, Rounders, and even clench your teeth through Everyone Says I Love You and Larry Flynt, just to see this brilliant actor sparkle!"
4,this Ashtanga Yoga is in fact Raja Yoga,"This book describes the eight limbs of the Ashtanga Yoga system, also known as Raja Yoga. For the people who look for an Ashtanga Vinyasa book, as taught by Sri K. Pattabhi Jois in Mysore, I would recommend Swenson's Practice Manual or John Scott's Ashtanga Yoga. As an Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga teacher, especially if you are new to yoga, I would also recommend great caution when doing some asanas as taught in this book. The body alignment is scary. My final word: practice yoga with a qualified yoga teacher first."
5,Concise and Precise Guide to Kundalini Yoga,"This book could well be titled ""Chakras, Kundalini and How to Awaken It"" as that is the information it contains. A concise guide to the systematic stages of this ""open secret."" I highly recommend this deceptively simple book to the seeker of spiritual yoga.I noted one reviewer here was disappointed because this book didn't fit their idea of ""power yoga."" This struck me as odd since kundalini yoga is very, very powerful. I think perhaps they, like many people, have confused power with perspiration. If you just want to be physically strong, yoga can do that for you. Perhaps one day though you will discover that yoga goes far beyond that. Perhaps then you may find this book helpful in your search for true spritual union.Namaste"
2,"this is not ""power yoga""","If you are planning to purchase this book thinking that it somehow relates to a power yoga regime (as I did) you would be mistaken. Although the book shows some very therapeutic poses, it also shows how to ""purify "" your nose by using dental floss and how to purge your stomach - not the book I thought it would be. For those fellow fans of power yoga I suggest Birch's Power Yoga - an excellent book."
1,Bad chemical taste,I purchased 6 boxess each of curry plus Basmaty and sprouts plus Basmati rice of Tasty Bite brand. I cooked one as instructed but could not eat more than a bite due to a strong chemical taste which I never tasted in caned or frozen foods. I am thowing all of the boxess fearing contamination with harmful chemicals/toxin. I am cosidering to send it to any Govt. chemical tasting lab.SKS
3,Good but not great,"I don't think entrees need rice which is almost the cheapest food on Earth. Nevertheless, the sprouts are good (not great) but don't look anything like the picture. If you need a fast complete meal this will do just fine. By no means is this 5 star cuisine. I prefer other Tasty Bite entrees much more (especially the eggplant). Read the nutrition information and pay attention to the saturated fat on all ready-to-eat Indian foods."
4,"Nice, natural taste. Will buy more.","I really liked the taste of this product, and it's not a bad price for around $2.50 per meal on amazon. This is a great addition to my selection of regular lunch items. Im really happy with the amount of protein and fiber in this product. My only gripe is the semi-high sodium content, but it's nothing excessive."
4,One of Tasty Bite's Best Products,"I was a bit skeptical when I purchased what is a hybrid product: sprouts and curry - humph. Actually, surprisingly good and filling. For those on the job, Tasty Bite is solid choice for microwave fast food - and this vegetarian treat works, better, in fact, than many of their more traditional offerings."
2,Not the same as the old one,"When I purchased this product, I expected it to be the same as the one I removed from under my sink. Unfortunately, the hose attachments were totally different. They no longer were the kind that screw in, they just pushed in. I prefer a tight fit because I don't want things popping off. If you don't mind that kind of connection, the previous model suited us fine until it developed a leak (12 years after initial instillation).We returned it, and lost lots of money. With the restocking fee and postage, I only got back about 20% of my purchase price. Had I realized that would be the case, I would have sold it or given it to somebody I know."
5,Love this!,I bought this because I found a little recipe on pinterest to mix with baking soda to freshen your mattress and carpets. It made my house smell so good. I'm also a nurse and use essential oils a lot for relaxing anxious elderly patients. So I'm a true believer that it really does have a relaxing side effect!
2,doesn't smell right,"this lavender doesn't smell right, ended up making my tummy ache instead of being relaxing, will not be using it"
4,Lovely!,"The lavender oil from Aura Cacia smells lovely. I put a few drops of it into my jojoba oil as an antiseptic for my skin. I'm new to using essential oils, so I have yet to find other uses for it."
5,use it to help sleep,I started using a drop on my pillow case each night to help me go to sleep about a year ago. Seems to help. I've used this brand in a wide variety of essential oils for years for aroma therapy & appreciate the consistency of quality control.
4,Quality oil for a great price,"While this is not the best (or even best deal) essential oil I have used, it certainly is worth its use. It's a quality level of oil for a very reasonable price.My only complaint is the bottle. I have always struggled with Aura Cacia's bottles. One's dropper simply did not work and the rest have funny-fitting lids.Even so, the bottles do work and the oil is a great deal."
4,Great,Smells great. Came on time.I bought a different brand for a different oil and it was cheaper and larger... So I may look there for my next refill... But I expect this to last a while.
3,Eh...,I received this oil about a third gone for leaking and it made my hands and the whole box was covered in it. It did succeed in the job I bought it for I just wish I could have used it all
3,Final Betrayal,"Ms. Taylor told a great story, and for her first published I thought she did a great job. However, being from Texas as Ms. Taylor, I am not sure that those people north of the Mason Dixon Line will understand her ""down home one liners"".I look forward to Ms. Taylor's next book and hopefully will one day be ranked right up there witn Sandra Brown and Nora Roberts."
5,Final Betrayal,"This is a thrilling romp that takes you through San Francisco and into the sexy and complicated past of Catherine Calabretta. She is a foot stompin' Texas babe who has an edge but also a softer side. Her side kicks are fully fleshed out characters that make the book what it is. And I loved Garbo the dog! The humour and the off the wall characters lift this above a run of the mill ""who dunnit"". It is near impossible to put down and I left the book wanting more. I hope the author has a follow up coming out soon!"
3,Nothing Special,This workout was nicely paced and lots of attention to safety was evident.But it is no different from any other yoga tape out there. And the instructor just talked toooooo much. She should watch Karen Voight's videos for a cuing model. Don't buy it. Just get Beth Shaw's yoga book.
2,Decent pick for anime X-Mas party,"Before he was making assloads of cash with Love Hina and Negima, Ken Akamatsu did a one-shot manga story that was turned into this 2-episode OVA. One X-Mas Eve, a lonely young man named Santa(yep, Santa!)is spending another year without his parents who're out helping unfortunate kids somewhere else in the world. So, he is visited by Mai, one of several teenage girls that works for Santa Claus, since he apparently fired all the elves for sexy Japanese girls. Mai has the power to turn into a tall blonde girl only on Christmas Eve, and takes Santa on a trip around the world to see the good his parents do. We cut ahead a few months later to an obligatory ""beach episode"" where we're introduced to even more of Santa's little helpers showing in in bikinis. This was a cute short OVA series, which hinted that there was going to be a 3rd episode complete with a giant reindeer mecha fight, but it turned out to be a gag ending."
5,satisfied-great watch better than it looks in the photo,"this is a great watch! it has a good weight with nice shiny solid steel. the buttons and functions work great and can be very useful at times. stores all sorts of info. it has mineral crystal also, not that cheap plastic crystal on some of casio's watches.my only gripe is that the light is a little weak and it can lose 30 secs per month, whereas others only lose 20. other than that, this is a masterpiece. with all its nifty and easy-to-learn functions the price is a steal. I highly reccomend this classy and elegant, but practical watch.(just because I'm 12 yrs old doesn't mean that my review can't be trusted. i am a pretty big watches and gadgets guy!)"
4,DaViD Pasadena Australia.,"I agree with the other reviewers, my only complaint is with the quality of the dvd. It is overly dark in some scenes, and the sound at times is hard to hear. Over all it is worth purchasing when you consider the price. The film contains stock footage from several Paramount movies including the Gary Cooper version entitled Fighting Caravans."
4,"""Roll along, sing your song; Wagon wheels carry me home...""","WAGON WHEELS (1934) - Randolph Scott, Gail Patrick, Billy Lee, Raymond Hatton, Monte Blue, Olin HowardHandsome Randy is trail boss on the first 1844 caravan to Oregon. Very good Charles Barton recreation of the era, adapted from Zane Gray's ""Fighting Caravans,"" has a lovely version of ""Wagon Wheels"" by The Guardsmen with an intro theSons of the Pioneersnever sang. Excellent fight sequences, night shots, costumes and equipage. With one or two more reels at the end, this hour film would've been a classic. Watch closely for Ann Sheridan's cameo. Presented by PARAMOUNT's Adolph Zukor."
3,No es lo mejor de Pérez Reverte,"Cuándo mencionan que es un libro de encargo, creo que lo dicen todo. Tiene sus partes emocionantes y el acostumbrado detalle histórico con mucho condimento nacionalista, lo cuál no esta mal, es su estilo. Pero carece de la espontaneidad y yo creo que se palpa que no disfrutó escribiéndolo tanto como otros libros, dónde siente el personaje. No decepciona, pero cabe esperar cosas muchas mejores si has leido su obra anterior. Si eres asiduo y toleras estos menoscabos, el disfrute esta garantizado, pero si eres lego, no te quedes sólo con este libro de Reverte, pues casi todos son mejores."
3,king size sheets,"These sheets look great and fit our king pillowtop mattress well, however they are already looking worn. The areas where the heaviest parts of the body lie are pilling and the sheets are sort of rough to the touch. We have only used them 3 times."
2,Queens are really Full sizes,"In order to use these sheets (before or after you wash them) you will have to get a size larger. I ordered queen size sheets and they did not fit my bed...mind you, I have a regular mattress, not the pillow top nor the extra thick kind. Aside from the sheets not fitting my bed, they were fine."
3,victoria collection 600 thread count,I was so excited about the price but after I've washed them they look like they are pilling?? They were great at first but now I'm very disappointed.
3,Not too impressed!,"Personally, I was not impressed with the ""feel"" of the sheets. I like smooth, permanent pressed style sheets. These will probably last a long time due to the 600 thread count. The fitted sheet is plenty full, but the top sheet is not as full across and lenthwise as I like. My daughter talked me into buyting these as she likes the high thread count sheets. Maybe a different brand would feel different, but this is the only one I am familiar with."
1,Poor Quality,"For 600 tc, I expected alot more. Sheets started to pill after only a few days. Were not the soft quality that I thought they would be either. Felt like the standard 180 tc ones. I returned them."
2,Why is it so hard to get fitted king sheets to fit & look good?,"Sheet does not fit bed. One corner has ripped away from the bottom seam even though we have only used sheet set four times. I do not think it shrunk when washed because it never fit properly. It comes off of the mattress @ the corners & has to be replaced after sitting/lying on bed. One time my husband put it on incorrectly; stripes across instead of up & down & it fit a little better. Are we putting it on incorrectly? Also, sheets & cases are very wrinkled when they come out of the dryer & need ironing to look & feel good on the bed. I feel like in this case we got what we paid for (inexpensive & questionable quality). Even though we buy books from Amazon on a regular basis - lost or late only when sent by USPS - I would think twice about ordering items other than media."
1,VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED...,We bought four sets of the Victoria Collection 600 thread count queen size. The fitted sheets do not fit on our queen bed. It seems like that were made for a full size not queen size... list this as a reject. We are VERY VERY disappointed.
2,The good deal that wasn't...,"I purchased these sheets as an additional set for a new mattress. The mattress probably measures 16"" in depth. The first time the sheets were put on the bed, they slightly pulled from the centers, i.e. the fitted sheet really just does not fit and snug very well. After washing, the fit continued to get worse. However, it has never pulled from the mattress around its corners. The original set of sheets that I had on my bed were 500TC (from a different manufacturer), and I was so happy with those that I couldn't wait to receive these new ones. Unfortunately, these 600 TC sheets are no where near as soft as my 500 TC ones, nor are they as soft as some 400 TC ones I purchased thereafter. Overall they are a set of sheets purchased at a very affordable price, but if I had to do it again, I think I'd of been happier not getting these and paying double the price of these for an addition 500 TC set."
5,A Gem of a Book,"I picked this book up for my preschool children to enjoy while the older children studied cartography. It was just right. The subject was covered in an easy to understand way, and the girls were very interested in it and wanted to do more map activities when we were finished. I loved the simplicity of the text and I'm certain that it will be a great book for when they begin reading independantly. This book is very, very well done, and an excellent educational value for preschool and early readers."
1,Terrible Phone,"This phone is the worst investment I've made. People on the other end have a tought time listening to what I say. When I call a number that is operated by an automated voice mail system, the call usually becomes distorted. Furthermore, when I enter number (such as an account number) the system does not recognize the entry or the call gets dropped.I do not recommend this purchase."
5,Fast Service,"Service was very fast, light bulbs are just as described. Everything works fine. No problems."
1,LOW PRICE... SHORT LIFE,"Had these for quite a while... bought them thinking why not save some money over the more expensive versions. But I replace three of these after they burn out for every one Malibu bulb I replace. Spending a lot more in the long run, not to mention the hassle of frequent bulb replacement."
2,Way Below Ed's Usual Standard,"Much as I enjoy Edward Abbey's work, I was very disappointed by this book. True, the characters are there, but nothing much happens to them. And sure, there is some monkey wrenching in defense of what is really important, but the story itself is barely there at all -- a succession of small and extraordinarily repetitive vignettes. There are humorous moments, mostly when he is poking fun at himself, but they're few and far between. Lots of sexual meandering, natural description of the Four Corners area, the usual avalances of wordplay, and some violence (most corporate, but a final Lone act that seems gratuitous). It's still Ed Abbey, but he's nowhere near his best. Given that it's only available in a pricey trade paperback, I'd skip it. The two stars are relative to his other work, not to books in general."
5,Excellent sequel to Monkey Wrench Gang,"This book was not as much a continuation of Monkey Wrench Gang as it was a reunion event. The gang gets back together for one final BANG!! Other than that, the novel stands as a wonderful window into the early days of Earth First! This is an essential read for anyone who gives a damn about the wilderness."
4,Good Sequel,"I really enjoyed this book, reading about the old gang joining together again. Abbey mentions names well known to those in the environmental movements. The immortal Hayduke certainly outdoes himself in this book. The only thing that made me a little uncomfortable was the murder-up to that point, it was a great book. Abbey betrayed the cause with that little turn of events."
2,Deviant Ed,"I've got to say I only read the first 100 pages or so. I was just put off by the foul language and sexual deviance. As much as I love Cactus Ed's writing, I have to say he seemed to become a dirty old man near the end. It was like reading a book by Quentin Tarrantino with the ... going off in every other sentence. He's got the right to write it and I've got the right to dislike it."
5,Great book from Abbey,Great read and includes all of the quirky characters from the original book. In the same style as The Monkey Wrench Gang.
3,If you love the desert...Edward Abbey is it...,Hayduke Lives was pretty lackluster compared to Monkey Wrench Gang but you gotta love Edward Abbey in all his irreverence.
4,Wonderful recipes - well received by friends and family,"I made the Mexican Fiesta Dip, Oniony Party Dip, and Fruit Dip mixes for 80 people as gifts for Christmas last year. All of the receipes were very well received by friends and family. They were very easy to make and delicious. My only criticism is that some of the ingredients were difficult to find. I had difficulty finding beef bouillon granules and I had to special order candied ginger through a restaurant supplier.I recommend the book. It's great for those who like cooking and dislike processed, store-bought foods."
2,No rocket science here,"Granulated boullion? Many of these recipes are pretty salty. Whlie some really cool ingredients SHOULD be utilized (how bout some powdered buttermilk or something?!)they are overlooked in this book for salt, sugar,& garlic powder.Be sure to try the recipe you intend to give at home first. I tried the Tangy onion dip and found it completely salty and one dimensional. The good thing about these books is that they allow you to GET creative, and they are little and cute, but more of a novelty item in my kitchen.Seasoned cooks might feel the same about these books."
4,All these books are great IDEA books!,"I buy these books for ideas. One reader ditched it for having too much salt and ingredients that are too salty. I get the gest of ideas from these books and then work out my own blends. And so yes use Buttermilk powder and milk and creme powders too. To cut the salt among other things. There are less salty soup bullions and flavorings and check out them at survivor food sites on line. As well as powdered beans or refried beans for making your own unique yet yummy dip recipes.....cummin goes great with bean dips and adds no salt. Remember chili seasonings can have other ingredients including salt or none it's up to you to check your products and seasons you reach for. But think outside the box and use these little books as idea books not ""MUST FOLLOW RECIPE TO THE T"" rigid guides. Always think outside the boxes.....and recipes too!"
3,Great Looking...not so durable,"Bought this product for my yard. Excellent looking birdhouse, well made but.... I sprayed it with a few coats of clear paint. Last just over a year before the wind, rain and snow destroyed it here in New England...This birdhouse would look best on an end table in your living room."
1,Not for PS3,"If you're looking to remove the screws for a ps3 hdd replacement, don't. This screwdriver does not work. I'm only downrating it because it didn't work, not that this is a bad tool. The handle feels nice, but it wasn't for me...The only way to get them out our pliers, trust me: [...]"
5,Gripping read,"Events that led up to Jane Hylton's brutal shooting of her boyfriend's lover, a woman that drove him to suicide, are covered in flashback while she waits in the cell before her hanging. No pardon from the governor arrives, only to add to the pain of lights on in her cell all night while she tries to sleep. Diana Dors played her part in a film based on the novel that expands the flashbacks more. The novel is supposedly based on the story of the last woman to be hanged in Britain, but those events really happened a few years later. Henry wrote Women in Prison and this novel from her own experience serving time as a prisoner. You won't forget the final words ""under the cherry tree."""
4,pure energy and transition,"Though i heard this album after Broken Star and am therefore much less impressed than i would have been otherwise, but this project is still one of the most inspirational and energetic punk CD's i have (and i have over 100). HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Highlights include Not Necessarily the News, It was Pancho Villa, Rainy Day, What Happened, Dropjaw and This Routine."
5,good nudity,there's a ton of nudity and a few sexual scenes that show some good action. I enjoyed the nudity. I couldnt make heads or tails from the plot as there are no words. I never studied the old tale that they refer to so I couldn't tell you how accurate it is. I can say there is good skin.
3,"get iPhone app, Shut the Box Classic instead",If you have iPhone or iPod touch then get the app instead. Shut the Box Classic looks like the real thing and you can take it anywhere. $0.99 US from the App store.
4,Awesome,I saw this movie on TV today and all i can say is its awesome. The action adventure will u keep you glued to the TV screen. Since i saw it on TV i bet the DVD will be even better
4,"GOOD if you like ""rocks"" hitting the Earth (and Hard SF too)","Beetween ""Lucifer's Hammer"" and ""The Hammer of God"", Benford's is better. You have to read it to the end, to see what happens. For a pre-Alvarez paradigm novel, the science is good. If you like the asteroid or comet hitting Earth stories, this is a good pick."
3,"Overkill the hallmark of ""Shiva Descending""","The rock-hitting-earth genre hit, quite literally, an all-time high in Shiva Descending. It seems that no city on the face of the earth is spared from the numerous smaller impacts that precede Shiva itself. To their credit, though, Benford and Rostler redeem themselves with a realistic account of the death of Cleveland.Though such swarms of small asteroids would be an extremely rare occurence, it does make for entertaining reading, especially as Shiva begins its final assault on the earth."
3,Low Throughput for Broadband,"The Linksys BEFSX41 is a fine router, but its maximum throughput measures only 19 Mbps and with the SPI engaged it drops to 14.01 Mbps which is just too slow for a modern high speed broadband connection.[...]~Maxx~"
1,Lemon- Steer Clear Money better spent elswhere,"This router would be no stars if possible. I just spent two hours trying every trick mentioned on DSLREPORTS.COM to get this working with NO success. Flashing to previous and newer firmware had no effect. I spoke with a CLEC tech on the other end of the connection who reported fragmented packet errors. Swapping out the router resolved the issue. We were using SBC DSL Speedstream 5100 connection hardware known good, I didn't have another brand on hand to check harware compatability. I'd highly recommend another router...don't venture down this path.Regards,Jeff"
3,"Excellent router for home, but beware VPN users","I have no problems whatsoever with the router performing and protecting for standard home use: in fact, I'd recommend it strongly for this use alone.Where I have a problem is connecting into my company's VPN. Tried turning off SPI, it connected, but couldn't broswe the MS network drives. Put the laptop on the DMZ w/SPI off, still the same issue. Moved the laptop to the DSL connection before the router: works fine (router isn't involved at this point). I also tried the laptop on other routers and it was fine with connecting in. By process of elimination, it has to be a problem with the Linksys, unfortunately.I still recommend this product, just beware if you're using it for connecting to a VPN.This is NOT related to the VPN functionality of the router itself, just its pass-through ability for IPSec/PPTP."
2,Worst technical support I've EVER seen,"Shortly after purchasing and using the product, I looked at its internal logs and noticed hundreds of lines indicating port scans (mostly UDP but some TCP). They were colored green. I couldn't find any information about this in the Linksys manual, so I called customer support. Not only could I barely understand them, they couldn't even answer my simple questions - are these port scans getting through? What does green indicate? Frankly, I don't even know if they understood my question. I have the feeling that this outsourced tech support has no expertise with this product. After several calls, I reached a tech that sent me a firmware patch ""downgrade"" to install. It turned out that he sent me the wrong firmware patch as it was for a completely different Linksys router. Had I installed it (if it would even install), I might have lost access to the device altogether. Beware: if you run into problems with this device, you're on your own."
2,Good news & bad news,"Bad news: Had to send first one back. Good news, no argument from tech support. They issued a RMA immediately.Good news: Second router does most of what it should. Bad news, it crashes when we upload big files (>2meg) and try to use the cookie, Java, and active X filters. Turn off the filters, and it works OK. We are pushing the little guy pretty hard. We use it as a router between 4 LAN side computers and a WAN side computer (the internet server). We are pushing 100 Mbps through the router both ways (one direction at a time).Good news, our church bought one to connect to a fractional T1 line and it works w/o a problem. Our installer strongly recommends the latest firmware based on his experience. Bad news, the published instrutions apply to the older firmware. The new firmware is much different, but very easy to use.All in all, it probably will work in most applications, but don't try to push it to the specification limits."
2,Go buy an electric fan to go with this router!!,"I have been a very loyal Linksys customer with high brand confidence. But, I will have to say that, this particular model get over-heated very easily. When it get over-heated, it will start to drop network connections, then the web interface will get shut, and the Ethernet port will refuse to work. I will have to unplug the power, and wait for ten minutes, then the router will get back on once it cools down. But this heat problem will repeat itself almost every couple hour.My solution: I grabbed a Westinghouse electric fan, and blow directly at it with the fan.Result: It has been working perfectly for almost 3 straight weeks now, not even with a hiccup.Verdict: Coincidence?"
3,OK but not perfect,"The router has nice features not found in some other similar routers but my router died after four weeks. The router started dropping the network every few minutes, driving users crazy. Since we were past the 30 day return period with Amazon we have had to work with LinkSys. I felt confident enough in the router to replace it with the same model but purchased locally to avoid the return delays if the replacement router had the same problem. So far all is well."
1,Won't see a Motorola SB4100,"I shoulda read the reviews first!!. The BEFSX41 does not see the Motorola SB4100 modem. I am connecting via Time Warner to Earthlink. The modem works fine connected directly to my PC, and the local networking of the router works well also. Just no connection with the internet through the router.Linksys technical support is hopeless -- nobody there ever heard of this problem. They told me the router was defective and I returned it for another -- same problem. Now they finally say it won't work with my modem. I learned more from these reviews than from the company.Maybe I can get my cable company to get me a SB5100 -- we'll see."
2,Not too happy with it...,"I had 2 of these routers and both died. After the second one die, I went with netgear. The NetGear does not have a lot of the detailed features that the LinkSys had, and I miss them. This NetGear (rp614 v2) has been giving me problems as well. I say pass on them both..."
1,Piece of junk,"I was attracted to this device because of Cisco's ownership of Linksys. Unfortunately, Cisco's quality standards have not filtered down to the Linksys line.Although configuration was straightforward with a web browser, once the router went into operation it blocked sites on its own - even with the firewall disabled. One of the blocked sites was - as you might expect - Amazon.Go figure."
2,Works... Most of the time,"I'd agree with others that the router offers fast setup, etc - but this is not exactly unique among SOHO routers these days.My problems are with stability. On a regular basis the router loses it's programming. Web interface to the router becomes garbled and it appears that the machine is scrambling its memory (IP addresses in date fields, etc). Within a few minutes - it's out for the count.Firmware flashes and all don't seem to solve it - and don't bother going to the website for support - it's slim at best and you'd think no one ever had an issue."
1,Don't Buy Linksys,"I had three of these routers. After about a year all of them stopped working. Not even a physical network connection. Even when they worked it was always intermittent at best. I purchased a slightly different model of linksys router from a different place later on. It also stopped working after a few months. I have subsequently purchased the cheapest Belkin product I could find at a local store to replace these units. The new routers I bought are in the same locations, performing the same functions as the linksys routers. The new routers work. I have never had to reset my belkin router in the 9 months I have had it in my home. Bottom line: linksys makes junk. Don't buy it."
2,Disappointed,"Three months after purchasing this router, it just stopped working. I tried reinstalling the software and firmware upgrades but nothing worked. I was really disappointed because I like Linksys and the router was easy to setup but I'm not sure if I'll purchase another Linksys as a replacement."
3,Linksys BEFSX41 EtherFast Cable/DSL Firewall Router (4-Port 10/100 Switch / VPN Endpoint),Easy for SOHO setup. Problem I found is with gaming. This router did not work well with a gaming enviroment. Its buffer filled up quick which caused delays compared to Linksys's newer products. Still a work-horse and reliable for business use. Found the product locked up easy on the web browser for remote admin which caused confusion and disgust for the end users having to getup and reset the router.I did not have the same issues on any of my other linksys products.
1,"Easy setup, poor performance, non-existant support","We bought 5 of these for our network. Setup and install was a breeze, however, these units can barely handle any load. They will either go into a self-rebooting loop or and ""off/on"" cycle (i.e. users can see the network for 3 minutes, then cant for 3, etc...). Customer service did not respond to any attempts to contact them. Linksys products are usually great and I'd recommend any of them except this unit."
2,Works if you don't mind intermittent outages,"Got the BEFSX41 to replace a 4-port router without firewall. The BEFSX41 initially seemed to work fine, but then I updated the firmware as it had firmware over 9 months old new in the box. The new firmware completely changes the look of the interface, which is fine, but now the box stops functioning every once in awhile. I can't have the box that is the central point in the network do that, so I'm reverting back to the plain router and will buy a more robust firewall box. I think they are pushing this box against its limit in order to keep the cost low, but it's just not worth the hassle."
1,Design Flaw -- Stay Away,"I have spent countless hours trying to get this product to work with SBC DSL and a SpeedStream DSL Modem. Spent at least 6 hours total on the phone to their incompetent Indian support group and 3 hours on the phone with SBC who graciously helped me to diganose the issues with a router that they do not support. This router is plagued with problems -- their solution is to revert to an older firmware. Yeah, right. In other words, this product is defective out of the box. After I installed a plain vanilla router (no VPN or enhanced Firewall), it worked fine. Linksys does not give refunds, so if you want to return it, make sure you return it to the reseller within their return policy.Support stinks, the product doesn't work and they don't issue refunds. I'd say that's reason enough to stay away."
4,DHCP bug in lateset code,Overall the product worked well but from time to time DHCP would only work for a single machine (I have 3). Finally code version 1.43.4 fixed the issue. I had problems with both 1.43 and 1.44.
1,Reboots / Resets Every Couple of Hours,"I was using firmware 1.50.18 on a version ""0"" BEFSX41. The BEFSX41 started resetting every few hours last week. I bought a new version 2 BEFSX41 thinking this has to be a hardware failure problem. Wrong, the new one started doing the same thing. Taking advice received on DSLReports I went back to an older 1.45.7 firmware reputed to be more stable than the widely reported buggy 1.50.18. Same problem. Stay away from this thing."
1,Don't Buy It,This router seems to die about once every couple of hours. It crashes every time I try to upload any large file to external servers. I have upgraded the firmware every time a new version was released. No changes.
5,Good Internet Protection - Excellent Price,"I have used linksys products for a number of years. They are pretty reliable and long lasting. Having a hardware firewall is much better, in my opinion, compared to software based one. So, this is a good solution at a very good price."
3,"bad, Bad, BAD",This router sucks. That's right ladies and gentlemen. I saw this thing for $50 a day ago. It looks like right after the holidays the demand went up and so did prices. It looks like people started doing their work / using Internet right on Dec 5 and decided to go router shopping. Terrible! Now I must wait for the price to drop again.
2,linksys router,It took to long to ship. Still having problems getting it to work correctly with my internet. It is not worth the money you have to pay out for it.. in my opinion.
2,"Great functionality, poor reliability","I purchased the BEFSX41 to replace another I had at a client remote office, creating a VPN back to the home office with a BEFVP41.In my 8+ years of using the BEFSX41, carefully deployed with surge protection and in climate-controlled environments, I have found that they are not reliable. The BEFSX41 often loses connectivity, requiring a hardware reboot (unplug & replug) every few months. At least once a year, a device needs complete replacement when it spontaneously gets bricked.Additionally, firmware upgrades often (50%+) fry it as well; when Linksys tech support is asked about this, they throw up their hands saying there is nothing that they can do.If you are looking for an inexpensive VPN endpoint with good VPN options, this is OK - just expect to reboot regularly and have replacements on hand for the inevitable bricking of the device."
2,Slow and flaky.,"The only reason for giving this product two stars rather than one is that it did manage to do its job, albeit poorly, for a while before driving me to replace it.It frequently crashes, web browsing feels sluggish compared to bypassing the router, connections frequently timed out that didn't with other routers, and the management interface can be maddeningly slow to respond.I'm probably running the ""wrong"" firmware, or could maybe buy some more time of decent operation if I sacrifice the right animal while ""resetting to factory settings"". I don't care. It's a flaky product out of the box, and it's about to be retired from my network."
2,VPN incompatible with ADSL service!,"What Linksys does not tell you on their website is that their box does not support PPPoA (protocol used by Qwest and many other DSL providers). Great as a firewall but absolutely useless for VPN. I spent more than 30 days trying to get it to work, and then could not return it--very frustrating!"
5,Works Great!,I replaced a switch with the router when I went with broadband. It took less than 5 minutes to get all my computers up and running.
4,"Nice router, fast, but doesn't support L2TP VPN","The Linksys BEFSX41 is a faster and superior router to the closest Netgear. I've found Linksys products in general to be more reliable than Netgear. BUT, I've been migrated to a new VPN client that utilizes IPsec L2TP. Although the Linksys does support IPsec pass thru, it does not allow L2TP. A couple of the bad reviews relate to VPN and I suspect that the trouble is using L2TP IpSec VPN. A change to PPTP will allow the tunnel to pass thru. But if you need to use L2TP then a diffenent router is needed.I would suggest the SMC Baricade SMCBR18VPN. Its better quality and supports L2TP. A 4 port version costs less, but unfortunatly both cost more than this Linksys."
1,Avoid this one,"This box has plenty of problems. I'm very unhappy with it.Dynamic DNS doesn't work.SNMP is broken.I'm using it to VPN from my home to our company's netscreen.The router is crashing at least twice a day because of some problems with the VPN.What's worse: linksys doesn't seem to be able to fix their bugs any more. Every time they release a new firmware that fixes something, it breaks something else (like e.g. SNMP).It's a royal mess."
1,Beware Buggy Firmware,"This review refers to firmware 1.45.3 dated Sep 26 2003. HTTP port 80 is port forwarded to a web server. The majority of the clients can reach the website fine. But for some clients (in particular clients on Southern Bell DSL and international clients in Singapore), the router will drop connection. This problem is particular to the Linksys BEFSX41, as replacing the router with another of a different brand (Fortinet) solves the problem. I'll never buy another Linksys router again."
1,Terrible product - never had reliable firmware,"search http://www.dslreports.com/forum/linksys for BEFSX41 and see what I meanPrimary use of this device is as a VPN endpoint. however VPN very unstable, and many features don't work. so beware!"
3,nice product...,its a good idea for an eyeliner but it doesnt stay on all day and the soft brown is too dark for my pale skin.
2,TMNT Game,Good while it lasted. Played with it for a little while and then traded for a different game. The game itself is good. Some children like to only play with it for a little bit a then it seems to get old to them.
2,Not much fun,"Ninja Turtle games are generally fun; but this game isn't. I bought 2 copies hoping to try out some multiplayer action with my PSPs. However, the multiplayer action is virtually non-existent and is just a side game.Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews beforehand but there is still hope for you.See for yourself: http://www.gamespot.com/psp/action/tmntthemovie/review.html"
4,TMNT,"I gave this to my grandson as a Christmas gift. He was excited about it because he loves the turtles! He was a little upset when he thought I got the wrong format...PSP. He asked santa for PSP and this was on Christmas Eve. My son hadn't told me that Santa was bringing the actual game system rather than from himself. It was ""smoothed"" over by talking with his Dad about waiting to see if Santa brings it and if not trading for a different format."
5,A must have,"As a university professor and a forensic computer examiner, this book is a must have for my library. Written clearly and with excellent directions, it give a good foundation to doing computer exams. Although written with Windows XP in mind, the knowledge gained can be extended to Vista and Win 7."
4,cute,"My two year old is a big fan of Rolie Polie Olie and I must say that this movie was a lot better then The Great Defender of Fun movie. This is a more up beat, happy movie with some very cute songs and a very cute story line. It's a very retro new age way in cartoons with its' bright colors and wonderful characters! This is a very entertaining show. The only thing bad I have to say is that these cartoons are usually around ten to fifteen minutes in length and this is a lot longer for a child to sit through and may get bored. But for the older kids it would be fine."
4,"Good, clean fun","My wife and I are very protective of our children (1-5 years old), and we don't let them watch many movies--in fact, even our oldest child has only seen about a dozen movies all the way through. But this Rolie Polie Olie movie, like its predecessor, was not only very decent, but also actively taught positive values, like the goodness of life and love of family. Originally a two-day rental from the video store, this is being added to our collection ASAP."
2,"alas, very disappointing","We love Rolie Polie Olie, but this movie is not up to par. Turning Gloomius Maximus into a good guy was a fine ending for Defender of Fun. Including him -- with a different accent badly done by a different and less good actor -- as part of the plotline in this one was a saccharine mistake. The adults were gritting their teeth throughout, not the case with the others. Here's hoping Springy-Time Fun is good!"
2,Where is Pappy?,"Our household loves Rolie Polie Olie. We ran right out on June 3, 2003 to purchase this dvd. What a disappointment when we sat and watched this film about ""Family frolicking fun"" and Pappy was no where in the entire movie!!! Pappy's name was not even mentioned. I'm sorry, but Rolie Polie Olie without Pappy is like popcorn without butter."
5,Insights on the journey home,"These sermons by Peter Marshall written in the 1940's still speak to us today.Peter Marshall brings to scripture reading a freshness that gives one the feeling of being human but destined for divine union with Christ.His early death at the age of 46 and his awareness of his own immortality gives the reader insights on life and beyond.He was a man on the move and lived each day to the fullest putting his faith and trust in God.Peter Marshall changed many lives and hearts, with the power of Christ within.His wife Catherine Marshall contributed these priceless sermons to all who are searching to live out their lives with dignity, hope and love."
5,I have several for a reason,"These are very handy tools, and I keep three of them in various locations for ready use. Stanley has been making this tool for years with minor modifications. It is well worth the money."
5,Best Screw Driver Ever,"I have owned this screw driver for a long time now, and I just ordered 2 more because I am always needing it in my car, work, and at home.The best features about it are the 2 different sized Flat heads, as well as 2 different sized Philip heads. On top of that it has 2 different sized hex heads for screws.The bit pieces are designed with a ball bearing and a spring that hold them in the driver. They never fall out! I can't stand it when bits fall out, but this screwdriver never has that problem.The plastic handle with a rubber grip is really nice too, especially since I work on a lot of electrical equipment."
4,Great tool at a great price,This screwdriver is your basic tool that every home tool kit can use. The price is reasonable and so far it is working great. I just wish they didn't stick a label on the tool. There really is no need for it and it wasn't easy to remove; there was some adhesive left behind.
5,I love this thing,"I use it all of the time. The way they store the four bits means that you never lose them. The whole thing is really well made and feels good in your hand. I have a high end electric, but this one is so nice that there has to be a lot of work involved before I would break out my electric. I tend to prefer this one."
5,Very compotable,"It's small, but it's great! I want this size & changeable. Stanley always satisfied. very useful and good for me!"
1,zzzzzzzzzz......,Ok I haven't read the manga but I saw the anime. Now I am an action fan so that's why I gave it such a low score. I thought the story line was dull and characters were only 1d (meaning not to realistic) I would say shut up with crud and just do something else. If your someone who doesn't like the fighting and like people sitting in their beds conplaing this is your manga.REMEMBER: this whole review was based on the anime but in less the manga is completely different I would rate it the same. So I say zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz......
2,GIVE ME MY CHANGE BACK!!!,"The authors Andreas may have had some interesting points to convey in a concise clear context, but took the lazy approach and used mind deadening conversations from recordings. This technique filled space with maximum words and minimum worthwhile content. In my opinion, grossly overrated by previous reviewers."
2,another shallow pointless NLP book,"disclaimer: I studied with Steve Andreas when he was at the top of his form and I think it was the best general experience of NLP that I have experienced, perhaps with the one exception of Richard Bandler in a peak moment.having said that: NLP must have the worst literaure ever generated by a discipline which imagines that it should be taken seriously.This book is simply awful, not much more or less awful than every other NLP book out there. Whatever NLP is, it doesn't translate to the written word... maybe no more than Jimi Hendrix transcriptions translate Jimi Hendrix... this detritus, and that's all it should be labelled as, this compost of concept, has all of the impact that hearing Voodoo Child played on an insipid string synthesizer at half tempo in a bloodless shopping mall out in the midwest somewhere... only much less interesting..."
2,Mediocre but solid,"I consider this to be your typical run of the mill NLP book. It's solid in its approach, addresses the key pieces and is well written. But it doesn't stand out."
1,P90x2,Bad the disc are scratch and are the same price than geting it at beach body and to long to recived
1,More of the same,"If you have P90X and want P90X2 without actually buying it, do the following steps:1. Take every weight work out in P90X and do them while balancing on one foot.2. Take every push up/floor exercise and do them while balancing on medicine balls.Congratulations! you now own P90X2!!!"
2,Money grab for beachbody,"The original p90x is what a workout should be, no additional products to buy you dont need just a solid, tough workout. p90x2 is a big money grab for beachbody where they push you to buy mats, medicine balls, foam rollers, shakes, etc. All the exercises are complex with most being dangerous. Stick wth the originial, just like movies the second one always sucks."
3,Not a big fan. Way to many commercials.,"I do NOT like P90X2.I can't say if they would work well because I only did them once. I could not stand all the commercials before getting to the work out. When the work out finally did start after 3-5 minutes the videos were 10+ minutes of warm up and stretch.I didn't feel the workouts were as good as P90X. I think these videos were to sell products not to get the best work out.However, I really enjoyed P90X, a lot!!! P90X really made a huge impact on my husband who never trained to allowing him to love to train. I am a personal trainer and it toned and strengthened me a great deal. I sent my P90X2 back.My humble option save your money and stick with P90X."
1,Do P90X,"I have both P90x and P90x2. I would be totally lost had I not done the original first. And as with most sequels it has not lived up to the hype, in my opinion. The nutrition guide is a waste, well there is a couple of different recipes that are good but the logic can be found on any website by googling good nutrition. And the fitness guide should be and embarrassment to BeachBody. No workout sheets are you kidding me I just paid $140 for this lame book. P90x is way better. Disappointing Product!"
1,narcissism?,"I love love love P90X and X+. I love Chalean Extreme and Turbofire. I love mixing them all up and doing multiple dvds on certain days. I've also added in Tai Cheng which is really good mixed in to your work-outs But this P90X2 just is one big beautiful people club. No feeling of connecting with his viewers just a venue to show himself off. And lets just get over the foam roller. BORING ...Boring warm-up No more fun, corny banter. Tony was/is his best when he's humble. No more ""do your best and forget the rest"" if u try to modify or skip the dangerous stuff you're down a lot of the time. It's a waste of money and I wish I had ordered something else. Like another Chalean or Insanity. There's just nothing for everyone here"
2,Don't Bother,"Man, this coulda been huge but they got it wrong.It is well known that combining resistance exercises with balance training compromises the results of both instead of getting maximal benefits. So much of this new program focuses on this mix which leads to half-baked results. Many of us wanted to continue building our strength and muscle but these new workouts will limit that growth.On a positive note, the PAP workouts - which are usually known as contrast or complex training - are fun and likely effective for those looking to improve athletic performance."
3,It's no P90X,"If you are looking for the next level of P90X, this isn't it. It involves a lot more balancing moves, and most of it is new, but it just doesn't live up to the first set of DVDs. My first week through the videos, I barely had any muscle soreness, and this hasn't changed at all over the length of the program. P90X2 requires ALOT more equipment, and if you can afford to purchase it all, it's a workout in itself setting it all out for each workout. The majority of each workout is Tony talking, warm-up, and cool-down. These videos are missing all of the simplicity of the first set. Save your money and go to the gym... You'll get a better workout and won't spend upwards of $200 in equipment."
2,must be two versions of this cd,I bought this cd after listening to the samples on Amazon and found that that they are not the same recordings and was disappointed and will be contacting the manufactor of these cds
5,Monroe 71606 Rear Strut Assembly,PRODUCT AS DESCRIBED. PUT ON MY VEHICLE MONTHS AGO AND WORKS FINE. PRICED RIGHT. EVERYTHING FINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
4,Sunday Arvo 'Pupy',"Great album but not as good as Que Cosas Tiene La Vida! This is a bit like Pupy on a sunday afternoon, very enjoyable and a little more moderate than Que Cosas Tiene La Vida! Mostly the same songs on both albums, a more relaxed pace on this one. Nice to hear different arrangements of both though. I saw these guys in Cuba (he played for Orquesta Reve as well before Van Van)and they rock!!! Buy It!"
2,Over priced,"Received the sunshade a couple of days ago. It's not a stiff flat design as shown in the picture, but rather of the flimsy bubble wrap type.It's very cheaply made and I don't see it lasting more than maybe one summer. Sure, it works as a shade but in comparison, so would a rectangle cut from a cardboard box.Definately not worth the $15+ I paid as these ""bubble"" type shades can be found in most autopart stores, Target and WalMart for well under $10."
2,Flimsy and disappointing,"Imagine a sheet of bubble wrap wrapped in a thin reflective material. Now imagine trying to keep that upright in your windshield. If you can't imagine it, then just buy this product, because that's exactly what you'll be getting. *Maybe* this would work if your vehicle windshield happened to match it precisely. We have a 2006 Corolla, and this sunshade was too short vertically to cover the whole windshield, and yet too long horizontally. Not that it would matter, because it is so flimsy that even if it were big enough it would still collapse. But it is a pretty color and will look great in a landfill."
3,Gold Sun Shade,"I purchased this shade for size and color. It covers my windshield and looks good in contrast to the dark blue paint of my car. I had another jumbo shade 3 or 4 years ago which was considerably heavier material.I was surprised and somewhat disappointed this shade is on the ""lite"" side. Hope it lasts. I think next time I need a sunshade I'll go to a couple of stores and check for weight."
2,Not good,It is not what I expected... It is too short in height but too long in length. It is not firm enough so it doesn't stay in place and it is hard to put on the window. It is already breaking down and collapsing in middle from the heat. The sides are separating (golden and silver side).
3,"Be more specific, why?","Before the order, it ask for your specific make and model of car. I gave specifics, but it is still too long. Standard, should be for all cars and jumbo for SUV's."
2,Poorly made and coming apart under the texas sun,"After approximately one week of use, this sunshade has begun to delaminate. The best way to describe its construction is like bubble wrap-- one side is a silver reflective material, the other side is gold both are very thin, mylar like material. Along many of the edges, extending up to six inches inward, the two layers are separating. This shouldn't affect how it works but might affect the lifespan of this as the loose thin layers are more likely to get snagged/torn during normal use.Though it is ""Jumbo"" sized, it doesn't fit the height of my Volvo XC90 windshield very well (too short) though the vehicle is listed on the package."
3,Does its job,Price is a bit too high but it works. We use it on our Honda Fit; the height is ok (a bit short) but this particular shade is a bit too wide and we end with some extra material flopping around the edges.
1,does not stay upright,"I bought this at Target and regret spending $15. This thing does not stay upright and does not cover my accord in height. In height it is short of almost 6"". It covers the length of the front glass shield and is slightly longer. I tried attaching flexi pipes so that it would stay upright but due to awkward construction and positioning of the front shield it is hard to keep those flexi pipes upright too."
5,I Love Agata's CD!!,I love this CD. I love listening to Agata. She has a magnificent voice. Every song is good from start to finish! I would tell anyone to try this CD its worth it!! I love you Agata!!
5,We love you all!!,"Agata you sing so nice! You are so intelligent young lady. After meeting with you the other day, my kids - the girls just want to be like you! You are amazing singer! We love you all!!"
4,That's a hit!,"I own a lot of cd's and not many of them can't be ranked by me as 5 star, because usually the cd contains only 1-2 song I really like.I love Agata's voice, her lyrics and the background music of almost every song. Her music seams to me like written and singed from the heart, with that expression like it would picture my own feelings. I do love hers music and her wonderful, unique smile, especially when she sings.In my opinion, the ""Save The Empty Space"" is one of the BEST songs I EVER heard. It is absolutely great song for everyone.Agata, good luck to you in producing more cd's like this one!!!Bob ..."
5,She is the best!!,Agata's CD is so fantastic that words can't explain its greatness. This album Is somthing you'll have 2 try out 4 yourself. She got the voice!! Believe me U won't regret buying this CD! She writes all her songs as well in Spanish! She is the best!
2,If you are an Indian (from India) do not buy this!,"This is an overpriced but nice-looking toy. However, that is probably the only nice thing I can say about it. It is tiny, so some of the names are very hard to read. When I first saw it, what caught my attention immediately was they showed Kashmir as a land outside of India (marked in white). Kashmir is still an integral part of India. Then, again, this toy is made in China. So, no wonder it was shown that way! To the manufacturers of this toy: How would you morons feel if India start constructing globes showing Tibet is outside of China's border?"
2,Not the most current globe..,"I thought this would be a great globe to keep on my desk...until I realized it was missing South Sudan. Granted it's a relatively new country, but the wall map I ordered on Amazon already reflected the change, so I don't appreciate the manufacturer unloading obsolete inventory at my expense. I will be returning this item, with the hopes that an updated version will soon follow."
4,look at the measurements,"The globe was smaller then I thought, but it's cute for a desk decoration. The shopping was fast. My son really enjoyed it, when he first received it."
2,Kind of small,I thought this would be bigger. It is very small and hard to see the names on the globe of the countries. Not really satisfied.
3,it is OK but little too small,it is nice look and is OK to use but little too small. but good size to put on kids' desk.
2,I don't like anybody very much,"I've enjoyed many Joanna Trollope novels in the past, but this one rubbed me the wrong way. She seems cynical about her characters, and gives them very little self-awareness or sensitivity to other people, and I went through the entire book not really liking anyone. I'm not even sure why I finished it, except that I didn't have any other books handy. Every character seemed self-centered, annoying and immature, rather than complex, likeable, and flawed, as I have felt about the characters in her past novels. Maybe I was just in the wrong mental space to read this book, but I wouldn't really recommend it, as it left me feeling like I had eaten a dry peach."
3,All that you'd expect,"This CD is most of the music you'd hear from any decent mariachi band or a soundtrack for a Mexican restaurant. Not terribly inventive or daring and on some tracks the production values are subpar. Overall, however, it's a fine introduction to traditional Mexican music and like any compilation, may very well lead the listener down the road to experiencing new artists."
2,Don't waste your money,"Its an okay CD but I don't think its worth your hard earned dollars. Many of the tracks are mediocre and there are few gems here. Instead, I recommend that you read through my guide on Mexican music which will expose you to dozens of wonderful Mexican albums and provide you with a historical background of the music.To see the guide simply click on my name above, then scroll to see all of my ""So you would like to....guides"""
