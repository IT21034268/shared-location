1,Actually harms your iPod!,"The vinyl plastic covering that's supposed to protect the screen is so hard, and the stitching inside so abrasive that it actually caused more scratches on my iPod than it prevented.Stay away from this product!"
1,Stay away from this!,G.C. is right it makes more damage than anything.One of my friends had it and after 1 month of using it it scratched the front and back leaving scuff marks on the screen. My 2g ipod(2 years old) looks in better shape than his. I use the Timbuk2 case; yeah I know you can't see the screen but it doesn't scratch it though.The problem in this DLO action Jacket is that sand or small particles get into the case and start rubbing against the ipod scratching it.The same problem happens with some cell phone cases
4,A challenging introductory text,"The Practice of Theology provides students with an insightful introduction and sourcebook, which challenges them to consider a variety of approaches to the diverse Christian tradition. By taking students through a comprehensive overview of the language, norms and goals of systematic theology, students will develop a fundamental appreciation for the causes for theological debate in the practical ""fleshing out"" of theology today. I'd recommend it as an introductory text for both progressive and conservative schools alike.-- The Most Reverend Francis-Maria Salvato, SFI, ThDAcademic Dean - ICTHUS SeminaryEditor - Gabriel Magazine"
1,not what was listed....,the order i placed stated the sapphire weight was 1.12 carats...BUT when i got it...i could barley tell there were stones on it...NOW it states it is only .28 carats...NOT WHAT I ORDERED!!! AND THE BAND IS THINNER THAN DENTAL FLOSS>>>>>SORRY SENDING ANOTHER RING BACK!!!!
1,JUNK...,"what a piece of junk,i bought this for my wife,i was embarassed to even let her see it,it was thinner that a human hair,the stones looked like they were painted on.the tag said made in taiwan,,,are you telling me we cant even make jewelry in this country anymore? what a joke.amazon should be ashamed of themselves just to be affiliated with this company..never ever ever ever buy jewelry online,you will be sorry.i would rather pay $500.00 for a well made american piece that i can hold in my hand at a jewelry store than to pay $129.00 for a piece of garbage that i thought i was getting a deal on.NEVER AGAIN.by the way i sent it back and got a refund"
5,It doesn't get any better,"I am an obsessive reader of speculative fiction, and consider myself a fair judge. Chiang is arguably the best author of short fiction in this genre alive today. Every one of these stories is an absolute gem. Of course, there's no money in short fiction--buy this book in hardcover and support this stunning young talent!"
5,Fiction Done Very Well,"I picked up Ted Chiang's ""Stories of Your Life and Others"" after reading a few synopses of the stories within. They sounded intriguing, and I was not let down after reading them. This is one of the best collections of an author's short stories I've read. It's incredibly exciting to discover a new writer of this caliber (whether they're really ""new"" or not--Ted was new to me)! His style is sharp and evocative in its descriptive yet measured power.If you like Science Fiction--or even if you just like through provoking stories--and you've been looking for something new and worthwhile to read, this is the book you must read."
2,A mixed bag,"The first few stories were quite entertaining and interesting. The later few, especially the last two, were very labored - yes, we get it: God is capricious, and beauty is subjective. He just keeps going on and on as if he's try to figure something out for himself. I bought the book on the strength of the reviews, and reading part of the first story on a Kindle preview. I was a bit disappointed - I'd be happier if the last two stories were simply not there."
2,I just don't understand the great reviews,"for this collection of short stories, I found some of the stories moderately engaging if laboured at best and the rest not. Some interesting ideas but no real standouts in this work and nothing that had me going WOW. A general SF anthology for any year XXXX would probably be more rewarding for most readers imo."
1,Stories of Your Life and Others,"I have two words to describe the stories in this book. Boring and depressing. This author could be described as the Shirley Jackson of SF. If this is the future of SF (as indicated by a blurb from Greg Bear, an author I have enjoyed reading, but now will no longer trust for book recommendations) then there is no SF in my future."
5,"Phenomenal, Sublime - A Treasure","Light a candle in the dark and open your mind to this surreal, otherworldly music. Astonishing harmonics inspire a deep sense of reverential awe. The gentle souls who created this music - using their voices only - have brought us a gift from across the divide, over mist shrouded mountains, from an undiscovered country. The soul cries in recognition of such beauty."
2,Lost in translation??,"This is supposed to be a very traditional Russian folk story with quite unique personages like Baba-Yaga in it. Unfortunately, some of the aspects are lost in translation. For starters, there's no Vasilisa the BRAVE in Russian fairy tales, never was. Vasilisa the Wise or Vasilisa the Beautiful weave their way from one story to another, but Vasilisa the Brave does not exist in Russian folklore. How hard is it to translate correctly the story that already written? It's not like one has to create it anew.I was looking for a book which would intriduce my kid to the traditional Russian fairy tales I grew up hearing, but the book that has such liberty in translation won't be one of them."
4,Wonderful Story,"This is a great story, similar to the story of Cinderella, where a young girl works hard to overcome her current situation. This story is unique in that there is a doll she cherishes and the help of her mother from afar that gets her through this challenging time. K.Y. Craft is an excellent illustrator, and the artwork is captivating. Every little detail is fascinating, and in some pages, even humorous. A beautiful story, excellent read for children and parents alike."
4,good book,"This is a very good book well worth the money. I would have given it 5 star rating, except for one thing. The author should have explained more clearly about the method of mapping used in chapter 3 since it is different from the previous chapters. It took me very long time to figure it out. My conclusion is go buy it, but be aware of what I just said."
1,Technology and bad writing have consigned this book to the trash heap,"This book, which purports to be from ""the ground up"" actually spends most of its text on building bean *content*. If you just want to know the ins-and-outs of building a bean, testing the bean, creating a JAR file, and loading and calling the JAR file in an application, this book is shockingly lacking in that most vital of information needed by a beginner JavaBean writer. Worse yet, the book is hopelessly out of date. The Bean Development Kit it uses for testing beans is no longer supported by Sun Microsystems. The new IDE, Netbeans, is not even mentioned in this text. Lastly, I found this book hard to read. This text is dead, and its death was not pretty. Do not buy this book."
5,"Subtle, eclectic folk-rock","Once you let this music in, you won't want it to go away. Although as an alterna-rock listener I found the folkiness of this album a little embarrassing at times, the insightful lyrics won me over. Worth at least one thorough listen. The only drawback is that this band isn't together anymore; I would have loved the opportunity to see them perform live. These people are about as real and non rock-star as you can get."
5,Pate w/Hazelnuts and Cognac review,"Very delicious but the shipping costs would not make it worth it for me to order it again. I believe that shipping costs more than double the price. Anyway, it's a fine product."
1,Disappointing,"Many multiple solution puzzles, no performance tracking, annoying sound effects. needs a lot of tweeking."
1,my dogs were scared to death of this item,"Pros: It's nice that it doesn't need batteries and is made of tough plastic.Cons: Both of my large dogs, a lab and St Bernard were scared to death of the sound created by this ball. We have a dog/cat toy exchange program with friends at work of toys that our pets didn't like. Two other people tried this ball and their dogs were afraid of it too. I think it would be better as a baby toy."
2,good while it lasts,My dog had two of these. ONe I got when she was much younger and loved it but lost it. Now she is almost a year old and bought her another one. She tore the whole thing apart in an hour. Not a good toy for big dogs dont wast the money on a big dog that will eat it in a short amount of time.
3,"Dog loves it, but definately could be more durable","My dog goes crazy for this toy, could not wait for me to get it out of the box. Unfortunately he had a tear in it within the first few minutes. Definately wish it was more durable."
2,None of my dogs have liked the Wiggly Gigglies,I bought several of these but neither our herding dogs or the setter liked them. Who knows why they like what they like though?
3,Wiggly Giggly Ball,I had one of these for 7 years with my german shepard. Of coarse it plain wore out so I ordered him another one. This one lasted 20 minutes before the noise makers were in the center of the ball. I think this is a great product for a puppy that does not have the jaw strength or mouth big enough to squash it.
4,Budo LOVED this ball!,I bought this for my brother's dog. He loved it! At first he was afraid of the noise it made. Then he really liked making it make noise. The only problem was that it didn't last very long. Budo is a lab and has very strong jaws. He was only able to play with it about three weeks. It was great while it lasted!
2,Not pleased with this toy,"I thought that it ""wiggled"" on it's own...but NO you have to move it yourself....I purchased this for my yorkies...and they are NOT interested in it one bit! Not a GREAT toy unless your dog LOVES balls...Then maybe it would be more fun for them. I purchased 2 of these things!! TOO much money spent on a dumb toy!"
1,"Wiggly Giggly Ball, Large","Out of all of the balls we have purchased from Amazon this past season, this was the most disapointing. There was a hole in it in less that five minutes and had to be throw out."
1,Too expensive at Amazon,I got an email from Amazon that this was priced down from $30 something to $16 or so. I click on the link to shop and then just to check the price type it into Google and turns out that almost everyplace is selling this item for less than $16!!! Shop around before buying because you can find it cheaper
4,Great for a Blind Dog,"My 8 year old lab loves fetch. Unfortunately, having lost her sight, she has some trouble locating a ball once it's landed! This ball is perfect. But as other reviewers have said, it's not so durable - so for sure, pets need supervision with this toy or it'll be easily destroyed. We use it only for fetch -- and it's just great."
1,puppy ball,"I bought this for my year old standard schnauzer and he chewed it up in minutes. It does have the cutest noise ever... a squeak, beep rattle combination. A small dog might be just fine with this. My dog did love it... to death."
1,Very disappointed,"I remembered this ball from years ago, when our older dog was a puppy. She loved it. It was made of hard plastic and made wonderful noises when she rolled it. So I ordered one for our new puppy. The design has changed to a soft rubber and within 15 minutes the puppy had chewed through this $15.00 and we were left with dangerous pieces of rubber we had to retrieve from his mouth. Value $1.00 per 1 minute. And dangerous."
5,AWESOME dog toy,"The thing makes noises as it rolls around and drives our dog CRAZY - barking and growling and high centering take place everytime our dog plays with this! It's a bit large for a puppy (hence the high centering) but once they get some size, it's perfect!"
2,good fun but not to sturdy,My fur kids really loved this ball. The only problem is that it only lasted about 30 minutes before they destroyed it!
5,Chloe loves her wiggly giggly....,My girl Chloe loves noisy interactive toys. But her primary objective is to dissect them immediately to get to the source of the sounds. Not able to destroy this toy. It's large and she knocks it around like a soccer ball. It makes her happy crazy!!! She bites it but has yet to make a puncture. I highly recommend if you have a dog who enjoys interactive toys.
4,Very Useful,"I'm diabetic and struggling to get my blood sugar under control so I was thrilled to see this book with its handy list of 750 foods. The list shows the GI and GL [Glucose Level] counts plus the carb count for a given quantity of each food. In trade paperback, it is light and easy to carry around. My only complaint is that the explanations can be a little hard to understand [okay, I don't understand some of them at all]. I like the idea of moderate levels of carbohydrate in my diet and that's what this book recommends. I've done the low carb route and lost weight but can't stick to it forever. For one thing, it just doesn't feel healthy to me."
4,health tool,Helpful in understanding the concept of diminished hunger using Glycemic Index as a dietary guide.
5,Great shirt,"This is a great shirt, both great looking and seems to be put together well. It hasn't gone through the wash yet, so we'll see how that turns out."
1,Disappointing Product,"While the soft cotton coating the wax ear plug is a very thoughtful addition to the product and does help a tiny bit with comfort, these earplugs simply do not block noise. Also - now I am stuck with two boxes nearly full of earplugs that do not work! The option to buy a smaller quantity would be nice."
5,The only ones that work for me,"I have been using these for 5 years to block the sound of my husband's snoring. Otherwise, I think our marriage would be on the rocks. I must have small ear canals or something, but foam ear plugs always make my ears hurt dreadfully. These block the sound very well, and are very comfortable."
3,not enough....,"I don't know whether it was because of my purposes or what exactly, but these earplugs did not do enough sound blocking. I got them so I could lower my stress and being would concentrate what I need to working at home and studying, with the many children outside my window screaming into all hours, randomly. Here I sit, using my voice recording software, and in my nightly meetings... Wearing the earplugs, yet still on edge, distressed, as the children outside scream-I can still hear them almost clearly and yet, I don't hear myself as well with the earplugs in due to the slight ""fuzz"" sound, that could be the earplugs interacting with my earphones... I was hoping for a natural product earplug, but will keep looking. I will keep the box for use during travel etc."
1,Big auditory canal? Stay away.,"Details:I can't get these to work. I have warmed with my palms and then molded with my fingers. They just won't fit in my ear.The wax starts out as a hard little ball surrounded by cotton. The directions tell me to unwrap wax. Not all of it come off, but I am not worried. Then, i am supposed to warm the wax in my very clean fingers. After the wax is malleable enough, I am supposed to shape it to fit in my auditory canal.Uh. Okay.So, I try to mold. Doesn't work. Then I try to push in and spread the wax so it covers the opening of my auditory canal. No good. Finally, I smush the two together to make a normal-sized wax earplug. Nope.Ironically, or maybe just sadly, there is a truck outside blasting music - I could sing along if I listened to bad music - and I can't get my earplugs to stay in my auditory canals so I am up writing this review."
5,ear plugs,These are the best ear plugs EVER and I can't live without them. I live near a freeway entrance and my boyfriend snores and I never hear anything! great
4,Works,"The unit was exactly what I was looking for - an identical sensor to replace a failed/problematic one. In my opinion, these things are a bit over priced to begin, but they seem that way everywhere. All-in-all, it worked and setup was a easy-peasy. (Make sure you know your installer codes for the alarm terminal.)"
4,It's Pretty Neat,"This product got my attention when I first saw it at Sharper Image. You won't find it there anymore, probably because it was too expensive. The Jeep Boombox is pretty neat. It has what a usual boombox has, except it's shaped like a box that you can close, which is what really convinced me to buy it.Pros:Shaped Like a box for convenienceHas CD Storage of 6 CDsCan be bought in 3 different colorsIs affordably pricedCons:It's very heavyTakes a lot of batteries (if you even want to take it anywhere)"
3,"fine organizer, but not very sturdy","We bought this because it was the only organizer available on Amazon with metal hooks rather than velcro attachment to closet bar. I still like the hooks for keeping the organizer in place, & the neutral color is really versatile. However, this organizer is pretty flimsy. And marketing it for sweater storage is a stretch - 1 average adult sweater does not fit very well into a cubby. But, this organizer is a good choice for kids-sized items. And the sale price was excellent."
5,Excellent,Great item. I needed more room in my closet and this was just what I needed. It also protects the sweaters from having bumps in them from hanging them with a hanger.
4,Good hanging organizer,"This product works as advertised and expected. Easy to put together and hang in the closet. and it certainly looks smaller than what is shown on the images and is certainly not for holding sweatersThe product arrived on time. The Hooks are good for keeping the organizer in place, & the neutral color is really versatile. However, this organizer is pretty flimsy. This organizer is a good choice for kids-sized items and utilities. And the sale price was excellent too.Will certainly recommend to buy one of these.NottyHeadedBoss"
2,Very Small,"This unit is very small and isn't that sturdy. It really could only fit a few sweaters and, when full, it doesn't hang straight. To me, it just doesn't save much closet space."
5,Richard's Homewares 3 Shelf Organizer,"I got two of these because I live in a small unit and I want to maximize floor space by not having a dresser. With the two of them, I could fit everything I had in my dresser. I am planning to get one more so that I can unpack the suitcase of clothes I have in my closet. These keeps my clothes organized and allow me to not have a dresser."
1,Poorly packaged; had been sitting in warehouse too long,"The product itself is ok. A bit flimsy, but does the job. The packaging was poor. It was covered in a thick layer of dust from sitting on a shelf too long. When I opened the plastic wrap around the product, the little SAP absorbing beads had leaked out of their package and spilled EVERYWHERE. I suddenly had 100 little beads all over my bedroom and I was desperately trying to clean them up while keeping my little baby and little dog away from the toxic substance. It was a very stressful morning for me with a 30-minute clean-up job all for an $11 shelf on which to store sweaters. Not worth it."
3,Hercules Karaoke Console - Works on Window XP only!!,"I was so excited getting the product so I can use in my laptop. I found out that it won't download in my Window Vista and Window 7, so I end up returning the item back. The good review here is the Return Policy, as soon as I send them the message a quick response was sent and gave me Return Authorization #, and mailed it back to them after a week or two I got refunded.I will not hesitate to buy another item through Amazon.com, It's worry free, service is fast, you shop at the cheapest price because they give you comparative prices on the same item and choose the best price,so when you order an item you will be confident that you really made a good deal each time."
2,Be careful of the dimensions,"I recently purchase this item expecting that the block would measure 8.1x12.1. Well, as it turns out, that's the dimension of the trim and not the block mount. The actual block measures 6x10 and was too small for my needs."
1,JUNK!,"I purchased this to keep in my saddle bag on my bicycle. It does not work at all with bike tires, the pressure will not register at all. Does not work! Do not buy!"
1,Maligning fantasy,"Although I appreciate the easy reading narrative format, I am incensed about the blatant defamatory rhetoric of the authors against ""white Americans"" as exploiters of American pioneering. They portray ""white Americans"" as superhuman, immune from hardship and failure as they waltzed across the western frontier purposely exploiting everyone and everything in their path. In my opinion the authors exhibit a personal vindictiveness against ""white Americans"".My understanding has always been that the West was hard won. ""White Americans"" ventured west searching for a chance to a better life just like any people do today.The authors ramble on with out any footnotes to historical documents to support their claims. Without reference they contradict themselves from one paragraph to the next.My greatest worry, this book is being used as a text book to teach students in a required American history course in California universities.Which way America?"
4,The Unknown is your Enemy,"Forsaken takes on a new world of characters, storyline, and graphics from the old Descent days. Yes, that was the game to play back then, but now, if you don't have a good enough PC to play the new Descent, this game is perfect to calm your cravings. With awsome lighting effects and graphics, it's no-doubt that this game could serve a great masterpiece of gameplay. The techno-tunes are also well played too. However, this game falls short of objectives. Basically, you just shoot and move on and not much more. This is not too harsh, but it would have been nice to have a little more to do. So go ahead and buy this game."
1,what good is a filter with no cartridge,Product looks great price looks great but no information any where to what type of cartridge and what is the cost or where to buy it.that kind of dum to sell a filter withou cartridge specialy on internet!!!!!
1,Very little smell and they are tiny,"These markers are very small--about 1/2 the length of a regular marker. Their smell ranges from very weak to non-existent. These are very disappointing and I will not purchase them again. I doubt that I will trust the manufacturer with any other items that they produce. I am a teacher and believe me, these are a waste of money. Use your limited funds on a better product."
1,Encouraging kids to sniff markers is insanity,"I cannot believe that scented markers still exist. I just finished reading an article about the popularity among some children for getting high from sniffing markers, glue, and other volatile chemical compounds. I learned about something called Sudden Sniffing Death Syndrome in which ONE huff of a chemical stops the user's heart resulting in death. Then here comes a product that actually ENCOURAGES kids to sniff the markers because they smell so good. INSANITY!"
4,good,"it was a little smaller than I envisioned, and the squeaker is tempermental. 7 more words required to com-plete review."
1,Lasted 3 Hours :(,"First kudos to Amazon for super-fast shipping!Now to the product itself.My dog is an older ""Westy"".He did like the ball but within 3 hours had destroyed it.I need to find a 'squeaky ball' that he cannot chew thru.I know it says...supervision is needed...which there was...me!What is really needed is a indestructible squeaky ball....I had peoplewho told me this ball was the answer....not for my dog!"
3,Poor quality and false advertising,"Just another poorly manufactured product sold to the American public with no visible sign of quality control. Congradulations to the manufacturer for making a proffit from a toy that does not do what it was advertised to do. If I shake the blasted item hard enough it might make a noise. You guys should stop selling this item for what is advertised for and sell it as just another semi colorful throw toy. I am a disgusted consumer that longs for ""Made In America"" printed on the products I buy."
3,"Gone in well, a little more than 60 seconds....","Cute ball with silly noises, but not made for a medium to large size dog unless they are very gentle with their toys. Our dog had this destroyed in 2 laps around the yard. Yes, he was unsupervised, but it wouldn't have helped to supervise him as quickly as he had a hole in it! Probably great for a smaller dog that would push it around to activate the sounds but not so much for a dog that can get it in his mouth and bite it. I had thought the ball was more rigid than it was when it arrived. Next time I will read the FULL description, not just the top one that says it is durable. Had I read the second description, I would have seen that it was polyvinyl and not bothered with it."
3,Just Okay,"It doesn't make the giggling noises very easily, I have to shake it hard to make it work. So when my dog is playing with it it is just another ball.... it's just okay."
1,"5"" wiggly giggly ball","""Extra Durable for Pets"" They must have used a doq with no teeth for T&E. Lasted 2 days with my Boxer. Waste of $8.95+ shipping"
1,$14 dollar chew toy for a lab mix puppy,"I bought this toy after reading reviews about high energy dogs running around with it to the point of exhaustion. That's great, but unfortunately that's if the toy survives that long. I have a 6 month old lab/blue heeler mix who loves to chew and LOVES squeaky toys. He played with it non-stop for 15 min., which is a feat for an intelligent dog that bores very easily and can figure out all the treat dispensing puzzles we have bought him in under 30 sec. This toy get a hole in it and the squeaky part were dislodged in under 15 min. A complete waste of money if your dog likes to chew and is bigger than a ""small"" dog. Just stick to throwing around 99 cent tennis balls and bargain bin squeakers, which have lasted longer than this toy and are much more disposable because they are so much cheaper."
3,Cute ball but not for xxs dogs,I think the ball is unique and funny but I have a 2 lb Chihuahua and it was just to big for her to play with. Would be a perfect toy for a dog that weighs 15+.
2,Not that great,"My dog, a 9 year-old Shih-Poo, loves toys and loves things that make noise. This ball was too big for him to play with, it was too hard for him to roll around, and the noises are very difficult to make. He is interested when i am shaking it, but loses interest when it hits the ground. I can see how this is fun for really big dogs, but the title ""small"" is misleading."
2,This went back!,"This ""wiggly giggly"" ball was very disappointing. I ordered the first one that seemed to be defective, which of course amazon was quick to replace. The second one came and was no better than the first one. It would only make those cute little noises if I shook it like a crazy person, but as soon as I would roll it for my little dog, it went mute. He lost interest in it pretty fast after that so it went back. I would have kept it for just a regular ball for him but at almost $12, I thought that was a little pricey for a do nothing ball."
1,Waiting for Wiggle...,"Disappointed. Still waiting for ""wiggly."" Without the ""wiggly,"" it becomes a boring ball - a pretty EXPENSIVE boring ball! Actually it's more of a rock, because it's too hard for my German Shepherd to really bite/hold... bummer."
3,A bit disappointing -- not as noisy as I would like,"This toy has a nice rubber feel to it and thus it is not susceptible to breaking easily in the jaws of young energetic dogs. However, it is not as noisy as, for example, the Babble Ball, which I also bought. If you have a strong, high energy dog, this may do because it can take a lot of playing around before it makes noises. My dog, who's 17 and quite low energy at this point, unfortunately didn't pay much attention to it."
4,"My pet is addicted to this toy, However toy is not very durable.","Great toy, but toy will not last long with a pet that likes to chew. A tougher material on the exterior would make this a must buy."
1,Not for aggressive dogs.,This is not a toy for aggressive dogs. Light plastic dog chewed threw it within 5 minutes. It has pieces inside that a dog could get choked on.
2,Not made like it use to,"Years ago I purchased this product for my energetic golden retriever and it lasted for a few years. He played with the wiggle giggle and had fun batting it around the room.Now I have a 8 month old golden and decided to purchase the item since my other golden enjoyed this toy. When I first gave it to him, he enjoyed playing with it and I was pleased he enjoyed it just as much as my older golden. In about 5 mintues he got 3 small holes in it with his teeth. I took it away and saw that the damage wasn't that bad but thought it was best to only have him play with it for a short time and supervised. I gave it to him the next day and he was excited to play with it after about 2 mintues he chewed a large hole in it and that was the end of that toy. Not worth spending the money and am disappointed that it doesn't last like it use to."
4,almost perfect,"my dogs have always loved this toy. unfortunately, it is now softer plastic which allows them to bite through and break off fragments they can eat. this is not safe for chewy dogs."
1,What a waste of money!,This toy was dead on delivery-no sound. I still gave it to my GSD who promptly chewed out the little sound holes. I hope he didn't manage to swallow any of those little pieces.
1,wiggly giggly ball,I ordered the wiggly giggly ball for my dog and it dont wiggle or giggle even when he moves it. It is a waste of money and I wish I could return it. So dont waste your time or money ordering it. I have a poodle/shitzu mix dog.
2,Only for light chewers,"My dog loved this toy and he got a lot of use out of it. The only problem is the he shredded it the whole time. It was a disaster within hours. The rubber is like a cheap dollar store sqeek toy. He still wanted to play with it, but almost choked on a loose piece, so we had to throw it away. Not worth the money."
1,it's not wiggling WTF,This is not a toy for dogs... be careful your dog may chew it into pieces and swallow it and the surgery is very expensive!!!!It doesn't' wiggle! WTF
4,Wiggly Giggly ball,My Schnauzer likes his wiggly giggly ball very much. He has not learned to push it though. Maybe that will come in time. Joan
1,Not like the kids Wiggly Giggly Ball,"I bought 2 Wiggly Giggly (Lg.) kids balls for my Twin Niece and Nephew from Amazon. These are Great toys and they Loved them. Colorful, amusing noises, well made.When I heard the noises that these kids Wiggly Giggly balls made, I knew I had to buy one for my Parents new puppy. So I went back to Amazon and found this smaller Wiggly Giggly ball made for multi-pets. Upon recieving this Multipet Wiggly Giggly, I was disapointed because it does not make the noises that the kids ball does and you actually have to shake it very hard just to get a small squeek. This should Never be sold under the same Wiggly Giggly name. I guess it's OK if you just want a ball for your pet, but not at this price.Someone should be sueing someone for name infringments. The puppy was more amused with eating the box than this toy."
4,a silly little toy,"The wiggly giggly ball is cute and makes cute noises - I originally bought one at a baby store for my then-2 year old son, but my basset hound quickly took ownership of it (she enjoyed it more anyway). One word of caution is that it is not a chewy ball - if the dog has a desire to chew on it then it will be history in no time. We are on our third wiggly ball for that reason - but still love them!"
2,Not pug approved,I purchased this toy for my pug. Several people raved about how much their dogs enjoyed playing with the ball. It does not make the giggly sounds very easily. We basically just roll it around on the floor and once or twice during play it makes a sound.This is the same outside or inside. The type of flooring doesn't seem to effect it much. This may be great for a bigger dog. Just not my dog.
1,No deal for the money...,"I bought this for my toy poodle...who promptly chewed the edges into little pieces. The package says that the noise makers have small metal rings, and that your the toy should be taken away from your dog if they start chewing on it...I believe that took about 15 minutes at my house...not worth the price at all! The packaging does not include any guarantee, or phone number to call with a complaint...only purchase this if you dog has no interest in chewing toys."
1,Silly stuff.,"This is the silliest thing I've ever watched. Theres no instruction here, folks. Just re-packaged American Idol fluff for the metal crowd. And this ain't metal! Horrible."
1,ZERO STARS!!! HORRIBLE,"I'm truly surprised this is still on the market. Singers, avoid this one like the plague."
1,This Price Is For A Single Bulb And Not For The Case,The price is for a single bulb and not for a case of 20.Someone needs to let them know that they are advertising the full spectrum light as a case of 20 and is actually just for one bulb.
4,Great for night flying,"I bought two of these to keep in the cockpit of my plane. The panel is not back lit, but relies on ceiling mounted red lights. I replace those with these blue LEDs. The blue light makes the white lettering on the instrument panel glow like they were under a black light.Pros: Bright enough at 2-3 feet, rugged and lightweightCons: Beam can't be focused, one flashlight was noticeably dimer than the other. Otherwise, would had been 5 stars. Can't see much beyond 5-6 feet."
5,Freestyle heaven,"How can you go wrong?- Stevie B, Lil Suzy, Judy Torres, Aby- If you like freestyle, this comp does not have any filler - just all hits by the defining stars of the Freestyle movement - Great mixes and completely enjoyable"
3,Disappointing,"I liked the characters, but just like in Bookends, the ending left me unfulfilled. I think the author avoided dealing with what could have been very dramatic writing by telling us about it later on; for example, when the baby is born. We are told it was very dramatic, after the fact, but why didn't she take us through the experience? This also happens again at the end of the book. As in Bookends, the characters are likeable, although the writing cliched, and the story ultimately disappointing in its conclusion. I think this will be the last book I read by this author."
3,"""The Other Woman"" is just another Jane Green novel...","Jane Green has brought us another entertaining ""chick lit"" novel. She's managed to invent a new sort of plot that I haven't read in any other books yet. ""The Other Woman"" was a nice change of pace from Green's other novels. Still, I prefer ""Bookends"" above all of her other books. It's worth reading, but I suggest borrowing it from a local library before buying it for yourself."
3,Enjoyable,"This book wasn't Jane Green's best, but it was a significant improvement over her last novel. I thought the character of Ellie was a little too self-absorbed; however, her background did justify in a way her annoyance with an overbearing mother-in-law. I did get sick of reading....""I Love her But"" complaints about the friend Lisa, and I didn't like the predictability of who Lisa was having an affair with. But, overall, I did enjoy the story and the events and progress of relationships and life."
4,It's A Lose-Lose,"This book spoke to me because I have been in a sort of standoff with my son's girlfriend for a few years now when I consider myself to be a most tolerant and accepting person! She's not his wife (yet) but still this book, with its descriptions of very raw exchanges between the mother-in-law and her son's wife, was valuable. It caused me to evaluate my own situation in a new way (though no solution suddenly came to me) and reflect on myself and my own words and actions in a very awkward and wrenching situation. A standoff with any family member is always a lose-lose and the most valuable thing that's lost is time spent together. The two women at war in this book are depicted in very realistic language and I found myself cheering both of them on to a resolution which comes about in a most surprising way for them. This book is a testament to both human flaws and human triumph!"
4,Sounds like a Lifetime Movie,"I enjoyed reading this alot! I remember feeling so much anger, empathy and sadness toward the ""other woman"" it's great to get that into a book.It is however no Jemima J."
3,"Wish I'd Read ""the other"" book","I was really disappointed in this book, and I'm normally a big Jane Green supporter. What this book lacked that her other books always deliver is a story that's interesting and humourous. The main character was probably supposed to be more complex, given her family background, but she just came across as spineless and annoying. I kept waiting for her to stick up for her meddling mother in law. Unfortunately, everyone in this book, including her husband, were wishy washy and uninteresting. I hope next time Green goes back to her trademark stories and characters that usually don't disappoint."
5,A Interesting book,"Ellie Black and Dan Cooper are getting married. Ellie believes that by marring Dan she will finally belong to a family. But with that family comes Linda Cooper, a woman Ellie see as someone that Ellie has to compete with. Then a event will happen that will change the whole family, and may end Dan and Ellie's marriage.""The Other Woman"" by Jane Green is a great book. Most times, I really don't like books by Ms. Green, but this was great. It show great emotions and wonderfull characterization. It should not be missed."
3,worst of Jane Green's books,"Well, it wasn't as good as I had hoped. Maybe if I had had read more of it at bigger blocks of time I would have gotten more into it, but the story never really grabbed me much. There were funny passages but I felt Green added a few too many subplots that made the focus drift somewhat. It surely is my least favorite Jane Green book so I was disappointed. It was much better in the beginning but surely lagged till the end. I was glad when it was over!"
4,"""Other Woman's"" not the problem","Jane Green isn't a showy or arty writer, but she sure can pull you into a plot and animate characters. ""The Other Woman"" is compulsively readable and frighteningly real: Who hasen't known an in-law, relative or co-worker who's a passive-aggressive nightmare? Unfortunately, however, Green has failed to create a likeable foil for the ""Monster-in-Law."" Ellie comes off as materialistic, selfish and superficial, and you can't help but wishing her long-suffering hubby would wise up and move on. The ending is also a bit melodramatic and strikes a false note. But Green does chick lit proud with generally good writing and a tight plot. I'll be seeking out her other books."
4,Definately held my attention,"This was a great read! The story was a unique look at a common issue. What I really found interesting was looking at the evolution of the relationship between daughter and mother-in-law and the admission of the main character that she may not have always been right in her reasons for not liking Mrs. Cooper. What I found a bit patronizing was that whenever Ellie would regress to a little girl when she really needed to stand up to her mil, was that the early death of Ellie's mother was always dredged up as the reason why she ""inacted"" in those situations. That became hard to believe of a single, successful, woman about town who would somehow regress into duh-ville over her mil.All in all, having had a mother in law or two in my life, I could identify with if not the specific instances, the sentiments and the pressure it can put on a marriage."
4,another winner from jane green,"The Other Woman is the third book I've read by Jane Green and I couldn't put it down. If you are looking for a fun read, this book is it! The twists and turns in the book were surprising. I couldn't imagine how I would handle a mother-in-law like Linda. So far, Jane Green hasn't disappointed me yet."
5,The theme of this book is timeless,"This book is a must read for anyone who is getting married or ismarried. When Ellie falls in love with Dan she is deeply in lovewith him and thrilled to become a member of his close family.Very quickly she finds the mother-in-law , she thought wasperfection, to be a very very overbearing force in their lives.Long before Tom is born Ellie is stressed out by in-law strain.Yes the book is santimonious and preachy, but that is point. Jane Green does a fantastic job of creating a character that it one can relate to and ultimately learn from.I look forward to the next Jane Green book."
1,the other woman,"This is a book about the dynamics of relationships between family members and close friends. The central character is a female named Ellie who is looking for the love of family and friends. Something she has never had either of in her life. There is a lot of bellyaching and moaning about how demanding her mother-in-law is. How bad her life has always been. The love hate relationship she has with her BFFs. I found myself wanting to tell her to shut up and get on with it, that what she is experiencing is what you call ""life"". Yeah and in the end they all come together and are one happy family. Ain't life grand. I would not recommend this book. I kept thinking wow Ms Green got this published?! In that case anyone could write a book."
3,Typical.,"Like all of Jane Green's books, don't take this one seriously unless you're looking for something that's...not too serious. Like all of her books, I recommend this one if you're looking for something amusing to take your mind off of heavier material, or just to have a quick and easy read. Otherwise, this book is pretty pointless. It's a bit corny when the protagonist and all of her friends start talking about how much they value each others' friendship and why, and yet the protagonist doesn't lead a very honorable lifestyle with her fiance/husband. The only character readers should really feel any pity for is the child involved. I noticed that the tone in this book is different, too: a lot less of that silly British slang. Overall, I can't decide if I'm sorry I read this book: it did provide an easy break from school, but I somehow felt dumber after reading it. Hmm..."
3,Wasn't this just a movie - Monster-in-Law,"After a summer attending weddings, I thought I'd give this book a try. I've loved Jane Green's books, and thought this looked fun. Unfortunately, it wasn't as much fun as I anticipated. For whatever reason, Ellie just isn't a character I liked so it was difficult to continue reading about a character I had no sympathy for what so ever. I wanted Ellie to stand up for herself, to get a life beyond her marriage and in-laws. Half way through the book the story lost my attention, there just didn't seem to be enough going on beyond the ""monster-in-law."" I wanted to like this story, but it's not Jane Green's best."
1,The other women,This book is/was corny... i read all the way up to chapter 25 an stop i couldn't take it anymore. I was so waiting for the jiucey part....it had two exciting parts regarding the mother. She did some crazy things but the book didnt focus on her alot. Actually i couldnt wait for the part regarding the mother because she did crazy things. Overall i wasted my money an time. This book is/was boring i didnt look forward to reading it....only when i was highly bored....
4,"Well-written, well-told story all women can relate to","Jane Green has the gift of gab - in written form! She tackled a topic all women can relate to - the overbearing, overly intrusive mother-in-law vs. you. Ellie, the main character, initially invites her prospective mother-in-law into her life because she was without a mother for most of hers. The invite turns imposing as she gets deeper into her marriage, making her husband the permanent referee. This book was so well done, I ordered 3 more Jane Green novels!!! Enjoy!"
3,At last! A Jane Green book I liked!,"I read both Bookends and To Have and to Hold and wasn't crazy about either of them. Those books were all plot with no character development. This book has at its center Ellie -- a 3 dimensional heroine with good qualities and bad. At times I ached for her, at other times I wanted to strangle her. I also really believed the way she changed as the book wore on."
2,"Oh, Jane, what's happened?","I figured The Other Woman had to be better than To Have and To Hold - but I was wrong! Talk about boring... let's see, would you want to read about 1. a woman who admits she has no friends outside of work colleagues, 2. a doormat of a main character who can't get up the nerve to keep her annoying mother-in-law at bay, 3. a husband who is so weak he can't tell his mother to mind her own business, 4. a storyline so bland, so downright boring that all any chapter contains is the wishy washy thoughts about Linda, a mother who needs to be put in her place? And it's not just the topic, the writing is also devoid of interest. Please, Jane, skip the married stories and return to where you came from - your singleton tales were so much more enjoyable and witty. At this point your books are like your character's relationships - stale, staid and not the least bit enjoyable."
4,Not-so-plain Jane,"Love that Jane Green. She's enormously talented when it comes to crafting clever characters and believeable storylines. The Other Woman continues Jane's tradition of creating humorous storylines. This one tackles the ever-troublesome monster-in-law who wants to ru(i)n her son's life. Don't miss this book!Also read: Mr. Maybe, The Next Big Thing, In Her Shoes"
2,Couldn't strand the main character!,"I love reading Brit lit, and in particular, Chick Brit Lit, but over the course of this book, I grew to hate the main character Ellie. She was whiny, bitchy, and complained about EVERYTHING. I mean, what is so terrible about your mother-in-law wanting to lavish gifts on your child or babysit for free? Come ON! It got to the point where I started sympathizing with the antagonist."
3,"It's Okay, but definitely not as good as her previous books","I LOVED Jemima J, Bookends, To Have & To Hold. This book is okay, but it just wasn't as compelling a read as they were. I didn't feel really engaged by the main character. The first half of the book I enjoyed, but later (without giving away any details) I didn't find the plot was going in any real direction - it seemed all over the place. There are some situations in the book that I found just ridiculous and unbelievable, which really isn't like most of Ms. Green's books. I look forward to reading more of her books in the future, but if you haven't read any of hers yet, start with Jemima J or To Have and To Hold or Bookends."
2,Disappointed in Quality,"I bought this item used, so I expected it to have some wear and tear as in normal use. I expected it to be like a well read library book. Instead, I got a book that was badly stained as if something has been spilled on it. The condition was marked as ""good"" but I feel like I need to disinfect after touching it. At least the price was good."
1,Bloody Terrible!,"Don't waste your time! I have read her other novels, some good mixed in with average, and this is the worst. She redeemed herself with Jemima J which is why I decided to read her latest. What a waste of time. I finished it because I hate not finishing books but it was a trial. Ugh. Also, I would hate to see any of her readers take any parenting advice from the main character in her book! For a better read, try Jemima J. For a better author, try Marian Keyes!!"
2,Easy read but pretty unfunny,"I really liked ""Jemima J"" and since the reviews said this book was so funny, I ran out and bought it since I had a horrific experience with an old boyfriend's mother. However, this woman seemed mild to me compared to many mother-in-laws out there, and the whole marriage dissolving in the book was very unfunny to me. In fact, the entire book wasn't funny at all, although I'd say it was an easy read. The main character struck me as an overreacting whiner! Also, the book just kind of depressed me and made me glad I choose not to have kids. I don't recommend the book if you're looking for a fun and light read!"
2,Stop preaching....,"I really wanted to like this bookI have always been a fan of Jane Green, but there is something sanctimonious about her voice in this book that is a complete turnoff. First, the mother-in-law is a pain, but stop whining about it already. The main character is also very preachy to me about her parenting skills. Lastly, I did not like the ""thank god i am not single"" theme that played throughout the book. Where is the author that reveled in being single? Both choices in life should be praised, whether you are married or single.I was not impressed. The last two Jane Green books have left much to be desired."
1,"Horrible, horrible book with annoying characters","I generally like Jane Green, but this was probably the worst book I ever read. I only finished it because I kept thinking it would get better, or there would be an awesome turn at the end. There wasn't. It was impossible to feel any empathy or even like for the main character because she was so passive and wishy washy. Ick. And her love-story with her husband was pathetic. You were supposed to feel like they were in love, but there was just nothing there. All of the characters lacked depth.Overall, the book just made me feel tense. Skip it."
2,How many times did you roll your eyes during this book?,"I have read several of Jane Green's books, and although some of them have unrealistic parts in them, they are usually at least enjoyable. This book was horrible to read. The ""evil"" mother-in-law was nowhere close to how she was described on the back of the book. This is what is written:""Ellie's problems have just began. When she discovers she is pregnant, she realizes that Linda has only been rehearsing for the real takeover"".What takeover? All Linda did was buy the baby a bunch of toys and clothes, show up at the hospital when her FIRST GRANDCHILD was about to be born, offer to babysit and give them a free vacation to the south of France. She may have dropped the baby, which was totally unrealistic, but it was an ACCIDENT.I could go on and on, but I will just say that I do not recommend this book."
4,Not bad,"I am a huge Jane Green fan, and just finished this book, The Other Woman. It is interesting to see a pattern develop in Green's plots, cheating husbands and possible cheating husbands, divorce and possible divorce, the other man, and with all the foreshadowing you can see each plot twist coming from a mile away. This book also moves at a really fast pace, but not necessarily in a good way. You turn the page and the next thing you know, months have gone by, and the narrorator is bringing us up to speed on what happened during that time span. I don't mean to sound so critical, I just would have liked to see something new in terms of a plot, and at a slower pace.The climax of the book is good, and once I got there, I literally could not put the book down until I finished it. I just would have liked the book more if it wasn't so predictable. But overall, it was a fun, very light read."
4,Cute story,"This was not the absolute best Jane Green book, but it was pretty relatable. Everyone has people that come into their life that comes on a little too strong or has problems with an in-law, this book is just an extreme example of that. The whole story is a bit far fetched in many ways, but it's entertaining and a fun book to read."
3,Jane Green=Chick Lit=Fun,"If you like chick lit, fun books for the 30 something crowd, you'll love The Other Woman. The chick lit phenomenon is growing up as evident in Jane Green's newest book. In The Other Woman, Ellie meets Mr. Right and gets married. They settle down and have a family. The Other Woman is not who you think it might. Definitely a fun book for the new chick lit crowd."
2,The main character was whiney and annoying,"The mother in law was overbearing, no doubt about that. However, I rarely found myself empathizing with Ellie at all. She overreacted to everything her mother did. Ellie was just so childish, I wanted to slap her.The most interesting aspect to the story was Ellie's relationship with her father. I wish the author had spent more time on that. Cause the ""oh, my mother in law is so terrible"" thing got old very quickly.I adore Jane Green's other books, but not this one!"
2,Lacks editing,"This reads like a first draft sloppily written to meet a deadline-- it needs some major revisions and added depth.I just cant get into a book written for ""grown-ups"" that's riddled with lines like: ""The cappuccino machine- an early wedding present from my chief exectuive- shouts a shiny hello from its corner on the kitchen worktop...""Shouts a shiny hello????? Shiny Hello brought to you by the Letter S? These silly lines belong in a kiddie book!"
3,Where's the excitement?,"I usually love Jane Green's work, she is hilarious and fun and not scared to touch on any imaginable topic. When I read The Other Woman, I was thoroughly disappointed. I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never did and the book just sort of dragged on the entire time. If you'd like to read Green's works, I'd suggest Jemima J or Mr. Maybe, but this book was nothing special."
5,Jane Green Does It Again,"If you are a fan of Jane Green you won't be disappointed by this one. The Other Woman starts out frustrating you from the start but you can only read on to find out what happens to these charecters in the end. This story has the capability to bring you to tears and at moments wanting to set the charecters straight! If you are familiar with Jane you know if you read on, the final pages will leave you content with where every one ends up and a smile on your face."
3,Entertaining chick lit,"I enjoy Jane Green as an author and found this book to be an entertaining read. That being said, its not as good as some of her other books."
5,Excellent for toddlers and babies,"We were introduced to Noddy and Friends on the Sprout channel, which no longer airs the British show. Our then 2-yr old daughter fell in love the first time she saw it. Even our 8-month old triples (2 boys and a girl) took notice of the show when it was on the TV. We bought the set of 5 DVDs from Wal-mart, which did not include the book. The stories are ~ 10 mins long each and all are educationally based on social situations like sharing, good vs naughty behavior, cooperation, telling the truth, and even counting. The DVD sets also have a 3-4 minute segment in between each story called Say It With Noddy, during which the children are introduced to foreign languages and sounds not normally spoken in the English language. This helps with learning other languages later in life. The animation and colors are outstanding. The characters are engaging and easy for the young to identify with. We highly recommend this fun set - even the adults enjoy watching with the kids."
4,Son loves it. No idea why.,"My son loves Noddy. He's 1 and a half. If I put this DVD in, he stops crying or settles down, no matter what else was going on. It's pretty boring for adults, I've watched it I don't know how many times. But any parent knows anything that makes the kid happy the way this show does is worth its weight in gold.The Googleberry Moon episode scares him a little (when Sly's face gets contorted from holding his breath) but this one's pretty harmless."
5,World of Wheels!,"I have always been drawn to informational wheels and color wheels. I find them gorgeous. The fact that the art form can also be used as an informational tool, genius. I never imagined there would be a book dedicated to the history of them, how short sited of me. Jessica Helfand needs no praise or accolades. As a lecturer for Yale University and co-partner at the Design Observer, she obviously is busy keeping her thumb and mind tuned into the current pulse of the graphic arts community. That she took a moment from this booming world to reflect and summarize an art-form of the past in this informative and inspiring book, I will always be grateful for. Technology advancements increase, iPhones are the modern informational wheel, we gain access to so much...and yet lose a little. For the nostalgia and beauty represented by each of these wheels is present in every photo. Reinventing the Wheel makes me want to unplug, pick up a wheel and turn."
1,disappointed,this product was not exactly what i wanted and wasnt described completely accurate...the vendor was responsive to my concerns and offered to accept a return or a different product...so i was not happy with the product but i had no issues with the seller..
3,Just ok,"It is a good book. But this book doesn't include the audio CDs. The listening exercise in the book requires the audio CDs. So the title of this item should not say ""Complete Course...""."
5,Great truck for the sandbox,I purchased this truck last year for my grandson. He loved it. He has used it a lot both indoors and out and despite hard use it still looks great.
4,A favorite with the opening cab and rotating dump container,"This was purchased for a 20 month old boy. He loves to constantly open and close the cab and has put two little people in the cab to look at. But, this does not seem to matter so much now as it did at the beginning. He does not use the dump part of the truck to put items in and likes to leave it in a dump or slanted position. He now likes to leave the cab open and slanted at all times as well. He likes to line the truck up in convoy style with other cars and trucks that he has. I would say that he has not used the truck as I thought he would have with hauling loads, but he plays with it every day and it withstands a beating. A very durable toy, great to look at and a very nice size. Even though he gets much pleasure from the dump truck I think it would be better for an older boy, say 4-7. I am happy with this purchase and would recommend this Roadmax Dump Truck."
4,Sturdy and well-priced,This toy delivered on all it promised. I imagine it will be in active play for several years. A very good choice as a first truck for a toddler.
3,Not good for little ones,"I bought this for my son, who is now 1 1/2. He loves pushing trucks around, and I liked that this wasn't made in China. But it has two problems--there's no way of locking in the back ""dump"" part, so when he tries to push it straight, it flips up or swivels around. This was so frustrating him so much that it led to tears and finally we took it away. He's not one to get frustrated easily. The cab window also doesn't not lock in place, which caused similar problems. The age says 2 and up, and maybe he's just too young. But my recommendation is it that it's not the best truck for little kids."
2,Not What I Thought,"When ordering this book I thought it was a hardcover book. When it came it was hardcover, but it was previously a library copy. So it has the plastic on the cover and the library tag. On the inside the library name is stamped. It should have been mentioned in the description that it was previously a library edition."
2,bought wrong item,Item is fine it was just not the correct thing. It cost little so we just didn't bother returning it.
4,incorrect product received,"I would prefer the correct length as ordered, instead of receiving a refund. The 3 in. ordered is needed"
5,Bright and Durable,This is a great light. I found it to be very bright even in smoke filled conditions. It is also very durable. It easily clips onto my jacket and stays secured while I'm working. The battery cover closes and seals tightly preventing water intrusion. I highly recommend this flashlight!
5,Best Flashlight Around,I bought this flashlight after seeing it on my nephews turnout gear. I was so impressed with it I just purchased my second one so that I always have one handy. The light is extremely bright and the three settings are great. One of the best features is that is balanced so that it can stand on its own hands free. I use it almost nightly when I take the dog out and just recently used it to install a light fixture in a basement. I plan on carrying this flashlight on road trips for the obvious reason but also as a makeshift warning light/flare set on the strobe setting. This flashlight is used by most of the countries finest fire departments. Enough said.
2,No insides!,"The product arrived quickly but i was disapointed to find that there was no fuse, spring, wiring etc. This product would be more correctly described as ""CIGARETTE LIGHTER PLUG BODY""."
1,Cigarette lighter plug not worth the money,This is a very low quality product and poorly described in the product description. No instruction are provided with the product. The company was good at responding to inquiry however the hassle factor and cost to return was to great and did not justify the return so i threw it in the trash.
3,Teen Angst in the Seventies,"""The World of Normal Boys"" is a coming of age story set in the late seventies in New Jersey. Young Robin macKenzie has set on a turbulant journey of exploration and self-realization as he begins to comprehend his budding homosexuality. I felt mixed on this novel. Although I felt that K.M. Soehnlein acurately and realistically portrayed the lifeof a tortured teen, at times I felt the character was grating to me as a reader. However about two thirds of the way through the book, I felt it redeemed itself, and had a satifying ending especially in terms of character growth."
4,Not just the boy next door,"This book really captured the sense of ""difference"" that I can remember feeling as a gay adolescent. To be not only gay, but smart and sensitive, leaves the main character with no one to talk to. The author captures the pain and poignance in Robin's attraction to other boys in his school. The willingness of those boys to use Robin sexually, and their reluctance to attach any emotion to their activities, makes for a poignant read. His development over the course of the novel is realistic, and rings true. A great read."
2,Have read better,"Yes, it has a few hints of sex, if that's what you are looking for, but overall the book is SLOW. It seems pieced up, haphazardly and you can't really get over with the main character... or any character for that matter. The idea was good but it was so poorly constructed that I ended up crying for the trees butchered to make the paper for the book, and every single penny I wasted on this. It's not totally hateful... if you have a good imagination and can create a alternate story with the characters and the general circumstances."
5,Reading this book was like remembering....,"There were so many moments while reading this book that just made me pause & think to myself ""Wow... I remember feeling like that!"". This book was brilliantly written for a first novel. The characters were quite believable & the plot was all too realistic. I finished this book with the kind of sadness that only comes when you don't want something to end."
4,Excellent.,i read this book in about a week. i was glued. that is all i have to say. and the only reason why i didn't give it five stars is because i e-mailed the author and he informed me that a second novel---a sequel---would not be comming out. damn.
1,Extremely bad layout!,"This book is a great disappointment. The graphic design and layout is very unprofessional. The receipes are formated in a way that are hard to read, as well as choice of color. While the book is consistent in its format, its not appropriate in all cases.The photographer is WAY too fond of motion blurr. I want to see what the food looks like, not have it wisking away from me.The receipes are decent, but given how things are presented, make me not want to try them."
5,the first and the best,"This set of anthologies was originally created to provide great erotica that were also safe sex. The result, thanks to the amazing authors, is a set of short stories that are hot and sweaty and downright breathtaking."
1,out-of-date tirade,"wilcox did artists a tremendous service when he first published this book: his emphasis on lightfast paints (that don't fade when exposed to light), his strong endorsement of the quinacridone pigments, and his tireless research -- this woke up the art materials industry and is responsible for the high quality of today's watercolor paints. but the book has aged badly: almost all the information is out of date (daniel smith and m. graham paints are not listed, current paint lines are completely changed from what is shown in the book, etc.). and then there are the endless tirades against alizarin crimson and the chartjunky outlines of paint tubes -- this gets tedious very quickly. if you need a paint products guide, get instead the hilary page guide to watercolor paints, which is current, informative, and friendly to use."
1,The least favorite book of my collection,Inaccurate information abounds. Tiresome reading. Little good information. Overly expensive...sorry I bought it.
4,"An excellent, if eccentric, guide to quality","I just received the 2000-2001 edition of this reference work, and found it fascinating. Wilcox has produced a consumers' guide to colors, with detailed comments on specific brands and information that can be of great help in color mixing. If you want to know which paints are most colorfast, and how to pick colors to avoid ""mud,"" this is the book for you. Wilcox DOES have his own Web site--and line of paint... Whether this colors his judgment (sorry, couldn't resist) or not, I don't know, but I found the book very helpful in planning not only what paints to buy, but colors to use."
1,"outdated poor quality book, dont waste your money","a poor quality book, badly written and full of mistakes. wilcox is clearly a charlaton, he rants on about other paints being poor quality whilst trying to sell you his own.I do not recomend this book to anyone.buy it at your peril"
2,Not as good as adverised!,This bed may be good for occassional use otherwise be prepared to pump air everytime you sleep on it as little air keeps on leaking all the time.
2,Doesn't last,"Within 6 months of purchase, center seam failed causing huge bulge in center of mattress, making bed totally unusable. E-mail to company explaining problem and asking for return authorization resulted in them telling me to call their Customer Service instead. Am still awaiting return authorization paperwork!"
1,Very Embarrased,"We bought this bed right before last Christmas to use as a guest bed for some family that stayed with us during the holiday. We set it up Christmas Eve for its first use, which was very comfortable initially. The next morning we came down stairs to find our guests sleeping on the couch because the bed deflated almost 1/2 of the way. I was very embarrassed to say the least and felt terrible that their overnight stay at my house wasn't a restful one. Needless to say, we packed the bed up and had it shipped back to the company for a refund.After reading the other reviews of folks who had similar problems with the bed as I did, I would not recommend taking your chances on this bed."
1,Handy but doesn't hold up very well,On my second areobed in 6 months. They are very handy and our kids love to sleep on it just for a change from the usual routine.But both areobeds we've had quickly developed leaks. This is with the average user (my two kids 5 and 10) being a very small percentage of the alleged max weight.Given the price paid for the bed I expected it to last far longer.
5,Awesone Rockin Blues Guitar & Great Vocals,"This is a great album, excellent music, great rockin blues. Lara Price has a unique sultry voice with power and soul. I especially appreciate her voice on the track ""If You Love me"", kind of a cross between Susan Tedeschi and Etta James. My favorite parts of this album is the amazing work by guitarist Laura Chavez, this gal can chop an axe! I am a huge fan of blues guitar, some of my favorite artists are Freddy King, Buddy, Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughn, and more. Laura Chavez is gem that shines amongst those favorite guitar players. She plays with power and passion, I am amazed at how she can channel so much energy through her strat. I especially like the live track ""Where, When Why"" I highly recommend this album, if you like rockin blues guitar and great female vocals, you'll love this."
5,A Woderful Story That All Should Read (Even Bush Haters),"I could not put this book down. I started it after General Frank's book and I cannot remember two books back to back like these two that were as moving and motivational. We live in a very cynical time where a any politician's expression of God is eyed skeptically. In President Bush's case, this book demonstrates clearly, it is not an exaggeration to say that his faith became his moral compass and has lead to his moral clarity on the fight against terrorism.This book shows how President Bush has brought a sense of obligation to the Oval Office. From day one, according to aides, he has begun each day praying on his knees. Each morning he reads the Bible and studies from a guide that features a daily Bible lesson.Mr. Kengor demonstrates clearly how faith and prayer achieved a heightened importance with the president after September 11, 2001. It was the pivotal point in his presidency and his guiding light today.This was a very good read!"
1,Lying and preferring the rich to the poor,"are not part of the gospel of Jesus Christ. That so many think that Bush is a man of god shows how little the gospels are actually read. Jesus had only disdain for the rich and endless compassion for the poor and marginalized. Yet Bush's tax cuts are mostly for the rich and his drug program for seniors greatly aids big pharma. And Bush lied us into the war in Iraq and continues to lie every time he says the war there makes this country safer, when our own national intelligence estimates show that it does not.Shame, Mr Bush."
1,Don't bother,"I read this book yesterday and found it disturbing. I have no issue with religion, but I seriously question George W. Bush's legitimacy as a leader let alone a spiritual one. This book is not about spirit, but about religion and only one side of religion. The author tries to paint a picture of a just and moral character in the context of near Christian fundamentalism.I have no problem with that, except the assertion that it is the way and not a way amoung other ways. It is hard for me to vision George W. Bush, as much more than someone born with an enormous silver spoon with someone always available to show him the way. If you are skeptic of fundamentalism and its message, stay away from this book."
1,Spiritual? Not even close.,"First off, this book provides grounds for impeachment based on violations of the separation of chhurch and state. His ""spiritual life"" has grown beyond his personal choices and infected the presidency. Don't belive me? Go look up the ""faith based initiatives"" and then decide. Where's the witch hunt now?How can anyone call this man spiritual when all he does is destroy the freedom and spirit this country was founded on? In 4 years he's trashed our civil rights, made a mockery of the country, fostered hatred for the US around the war, and pretty much started a holy war against Islam. Doesn't sound too spiritual."
2,This book is pure Propaganda,As a publisher of children's books I think it is a shame to use spirituality as a way to get into the soft spots of people's hearts to sell a man whose actions are cynical and ungodly
1,One religion for USA,I would think that Americans would take heed to what's hapening around the world in the name of religion - The Crusades; the Salem Witch trials; Irish Catholics v. Protestans; Jew v. Gentile; Mulsim v. Jew; Muslin v. Christian; Christian v. Buddists; Do we really want Bush's verson of religion as the state religion in America? Bush is the only U.S. president to attempt to impose his particular religion on the country in a dangerous disregard for separation of church and state.
2,Not as great as it could be...,"While the cost of shipping was greater than the cost of the product, the wrenches themselves didn't have enough material to make the wrench comfortable in your hand. In any situation when you need to really torque the wrench, you find your hand in immense pain.The wrenches aren't bad, but they're not the best. For a few more dollars, step up to some that have a wider handle to save your hands."
4,Best Missionary Novel I have Ever Read,Eileen Crossman's account of her father's incredible life among the minority tribes of China is a story like no other. Here is a man who inspired other great missionaries like Isobel Kuhn to go to China. To read how God took this young single man and placed him a lonely country to reach the unreached inspired me beyond no end. I still think of his words of how he came to the point of learning to be content in the midst of great difficulties. I highly recommend this book to all Christians who are even remotely considering the missionfield.
1,Bad description,Product might be fine but I do not know. The sizes are mislabeled. I ordered a medium after researching the sizes on the manufacturers website. They sent a YOUTH medium which is very small. Need to change the descriptions.
5,Cold Gear leggings,I purchased these to wear to the Redskins/Cowboys game and my legs never did get cold. This is a great product.
5,WICKED SWEET!,"i have owned several products by under armour and this was one product i never owned. i needed a pair i can wear under my uniform at work and for hunting. i bought a pair of these and they are extremely warm, very light weight and very comfortable. this is just another amazing product by under armour. keep up the good work. just a note: i wear a size 38 pants, the XXL size fits perfectly."
5,Love it!,"Anything under armour is great- I loooooooove the under armour line. It always impresses me! These leggings are great for running, etc, keeping you warm. They do their job and do their job well!"
2,"Good product, yet way over-priced","I bought a pair of these and thought they would work out fine. Luckily I happened to be looking for some other running clothes and found something else for literally half the price made out of the exact same material. So I quickly returned them. Under Armour is to training clothes what the ipod is to the mp3 world. You are paying for a name, nothing more. You can walk into any sports store and get something that's the same material and quality for half the price (or at least 15-20 $ cheaper.) There is no need to waste money on these, unless you are one of those people who are exercising to look cool and hip with your over-priced clothing, then continue to buy these."
4,One of the best Stanley's Albums,"When I First listened to that album (especially the masterpiece ""Future Shock""), I couldn't beleive it!I think that these tunes(that this album includes) (Future Shock as well as Speedball) are two of the most beautiful songs that Stanley gave us!"
1,Nothing to get excited about,I listen to this album once then took it to the store to sell it for two dollars to get something else. This is ultimate cheese. It sound like Stanley lost a bet. If you want to get the worst album Clarke ever made get this one. The mix is so over saturated with cheap keyboard sounds that no more words are worth the effort. Go get If this bass could only talk or Live at the Greek. Enough is enough!
1,Only 1 good song on this CD!!!! F-,"This CD is garbage, and I expected much better from Clarke. The ONLY SONG on this CD that is worth while is the wonderful 'Heaven Sent You', which is sung by Howard Hewett. In fact, I got the CD for this one song!! Don't pay too much for this CD!!! Get it used!!!"
5,THE BEST...BEST OF,"We've all got Best ofs' in our collections,but how many times have we been dissappointed in the compiler's choice? Not in this case,every track is a jewel,AND importantly,all original cuts.I must confess,I already had 90% of the tracks either on vinyl(which I hate)or buried somewhere on reel-tape.Now they're all here on one fabulous CD.I would have paid the price for just one track...the superb ""Bits & Pieces Of Life""Enough waffling...just buy it!"
4,most people do not remember Cal Smith,"He has a lot of great tunes but, you seldome hear his music on the radio anymore. His songs were mainstays of the Juckboxes back in the day. I'm certain you will get a lot of listening pleasure from this CD."
1,Doesn't Fit !!,Amazon really needs to check some of their cross reference charts. This does not it a 2011 Kia LX Sorento.
5,Good Quality & Fits,It fits my 2010 Genesis Coupe and the quality seems better than the one I bought at the dealership. I change mine every 2 years.
4,Standard filter - tight fit,"I bought this filter for my Gen Coupe and noticed it was a lightly tight fit. However, I managed to get it in and instantly the air was fresher. The old filter had a lot of gunk in it and made the car smell a little of mud and dried leaves. This one resolved it."
5,Amazing!!!!,"This is the most amazing and funny game I have ever played. The graphics and themes are as a dream and fantasy. The landscapes are beautiful. I expend a lot of time playing it with my children. No violence, no sex. Specially for my children."
4,Asterix and Caesar's Gift,"""Asterix and Caesar's Gift"" (1974) is Asterix #21 It's fairly good. Worth a look for fans of characters in the village like Geriatrix and Vitalstatistix.Julius Caesar gives his troops a plot of land if they give 20 years of work to his army. Julius has overheard that one man up for retirement doesn't like him, so Julius gives him a deed to land he hasn't conquered yet, Vitalstatistix's Gaulish village. Man can't be bothered going all the way up to the corner of Gaul, so he sells his plot for some beer to a tavern keeper, who goes with his family to claim the village. Challenges and chaos follow in the village..."
3,Not the best...,"Well, its Asterix, so of course its wonderful. It certainly is not the best one, though. Rome has a new tack for conquering the village, one that causes even more dissension then usual. The addition of a rather annoying girl who seems to wrap all of the men around her finger is a sorry newcomer who just doesnt live up to the normally delightful characters. Of course it has all of the elements that make Astrix wonderful, and it is true no collection would be complete without it."
4,"A fine book, but cheaply made",The paperback edition of this book fell apart in my hands -- and on the first reading no less. The replacement copy did the same thing.
2,Mediocre debut...,"""Religious Body"" is the first novel of crime novelist Catherine Aird. We meet Inspector C.D Sloan of the Calleshire CID, as he tries to solve a baffling murder of a nun at a convent. Soon, he discovers that someone was doing some cross-dressing, and that a group of boys had help in stealing a habit for a bonfire to celebrate Guy Fawkes Day. It isn't really bad, but the dialogue has an empty feel, and it seems like Aird is still finding her voice."
3,Just ok,This is a decent old style mystery. Young nun found dead in a locked convent...hmm. Supposedly Aird's mother guessed the outcome every time. While the story is interesting and the characters mostly believable--there is no way she got this one. The culprit's motive and connection made little sense and werent presented until the very end. This was Aird's first book though and since I really enjoyedA Most Contagious Game (Rue Morgue Classic British Mysteries)I will give the next one a shot.
5,Perfectly Balanced Suspense,"As always, Thompson provides a great balance of suspense and romance with characters you care about until the end. A recommended read for those who enjoy suspense!"
1,Could not get download code to work. Wiley no help!,"I had hoped that working through this book would bring extra insight and new techniques. After all, I have been a database consultant for 15 years and designed, programed and implemented many large solutions.I found that the book left much unsaid and detailed instructions non existant. I had problems with the download code. It appears to be tied up with VS team system, so if you are a home or small business who is unfamiliar with tem system then you may have problems.I contacted Wiley Customer Support, but they just told me the code works and provided nothing helpful.I will not be buying any more Wrox / Wiley books."
4,better than bubbly,"I am new to this type of work out, so the first few times doing it i appreciated all the explaination that went along with it. However, after doing it for a while I found that I had to grab the remote and fast forward through some of the ""talk"", though not to much. (Personally I don't know how she CAN talk i during some of the routines. :-) It does do what it sets out to do,(tones your body) and that is what makes it a good video. I don't care for bouncy, giggly instructors that many videos have, and appreciate that she is instructive and encouraging in a positive, mature, and helpful way. Great for a beginner to this type of work out!"
3,Good but...,I have several Pilates tapes and I had problems with this one. It's one-on-one with Moira Stott and the presentation was just a bit too flat and slow-paced. I had trouble just finishing the warm-up without falling asleep.
2,"Thorough, non-stop, monotonous instruction!","The instructor does explain everything VERY thoroughly, in extremely slow and excruciating detail; in fact, she never stops talking. At all. I like exercise videos and would like to try Pilates but the non-stop monotone drone of the instructor is really irritating. Each exercise is done very slowly while she explains what to do and anything and everything anyone could possibly do wrong. I made it through about 20 minutes of the video before giving in and tossing it out. Not for those with limited patience or looking for a workout!"
3,Marlon Brando,"I purchased this toy along with a set of minature musical instruments for my nephew who is nearly two years old. My brother positively raved about the merits of the latter but when I pressed him to comment on the bath paints he said ""Think Marlon Brando in Apocolypse Now""."
4,"Alternative cat health, California style","Celeste Yarnall, a former beauty queen and present cat breeder and nutritionist, has California credentials, which means that she doesn't hesitate to talk about what others would consider flaky and New Age: astrology, dowsing, Eastern philosophies, homeopathy, alchemy, flower remedies, herbs, etc., etc--and their place in your cat's health picture. She also advocates a raw foods diet with plenty of supplements to go along with it for cats, something which I've recently been exploring, with mixed results (It's very difficult to convert the average feline to another way of eating after she's gotten used to the old way. Patience and persistence are key, and the end result, a longer-lived, healthier cat, is worth it). There are more and more books out there about alternative nutrition and health for pets, but this one, in my opinion, is well-written and well-researched and well worth buying."
3,Excellent game-pad for fps style games,I bought this to play fps style games on my laptop.Pros:-----1) Strong build quality.2) Ambidextrous design3) Customizabe layout4) Ideazon pre-sets for games5) Quick response timesCons:-----1) Un-ergonomic (if there is such a word). You almost always have to move your hand to reach the keys on the side.2) Lack of a scroll-wheel4) Not sure how good this will be to play role-playing/strategy gamesI hope there will be an improved version of this by Ideazon in future.
4,works great so far,"My son uses it for some of his games, for others he prefers to stick with the keyboard."
4,Fang Review,"I was a little leary about trying this product sight unseen, but I've got to say how impressed I am by the Fang Gamepad. It's very high quality construction will last a long time. The keys are comfortable and responsive. The only complaint I would have is that the drivers that come with the gamepad will not auto update, but it was a simple matter to go the their homepage and download the most current drivers. I mainly use this pad for MMORPGs and it's been an awsome addition to my gameplay."
3,Good pad but I wish it were programmable,"The game pad is very good for the Multiplayer Online Games I like to play; the only drawback is it is not really programmable. Instead you have to use either the default settings that are available for your game or set your in-game key settings to match the pad. I have tried several different keyboards and game pads and this one is the best I have used. However, I can only give 3 stars because it is not programmable. It would be the perfect game pad if the keys could be programmed similar to the way the G15 Logitech keyboard can be programmed. Then I would give it 5 stars."
2,"Great Experience, not so great item.","I was very happy with the experience I had with the seller, however, I was unimpressed by the product. This was really no fault of the seller. I just found the item to be too bulky for my needs."
1,Absolute Junk,"This was by far the worse purchase ever it didn't even work out of the box, and the construction is so flimsy, it's pathetic. Oh and fyi the instructions are so vague, goodluck understanding em. I think my 6 yr old niece could have done a better job writing the instructions. Do yourself a favor and avoid this piece of junk at all costs. Buy a nostramos n52 pad not as many buttons, but much much better over all."
2,Too large and space wasted below movement keys,"I tried out the Fang with Call of Duty 4 and returned it after a long weekend. My main complaint is that there are no buttons directly below the movement pad. These keys are easily accessible on a standard keyboard, but the area is wasted space here. In addition, the movement keys are oversized so you really have to reach for other buttons, especially the numbered buttons which feel a bit separated from the movement keys. The 3 keys on either side below the movement keys are nicely sized, but are too close to the palm to be easily reached with the thumb and too far down to reach with a finger. I'm a lefty, so another annoyance was that the two left side buttons are both mapped to the ""n"" key, essentially making one useless."
4,Great little game pad,I purchased this game pad to play WoW. It does what it says. I don't particularly like the default jump button on the side though.
3,Almost there...,"If this had lighted keys it would be perfect. Until then, I'm sticking with the Merc Stealth Illuminated gaming keyboard."
3,"Nice idea, but needs work","This brush does a good job of cleaning some sections of a decanter, but doesn't completely cover all of the interior. It works well, but a redesign (perhaps making it a bit more pliable) would make it perfect."
3,doesn't completely clean,"the ""brush"" (it's really a bunch of foamy shapes on a wand) does not reach all areas of my decanter, there is no way to really control where it goes when I push it in further and it bends. it's hit & miss, depending on the shape of decanter you own it might do a great job - or not... my decanter is rather wide with a really narrow neck, and an indentation in the bottom."
4,Good Solution,"Works well for cleaning decanters, or anything with a narrow neck, and does the job that many others would not ... A neat solution, for those attempting to clean unusual vessels."
2,Below average....,"Hard to use, doesn't flex as described. Fails to clean more than half of remnants. I give up..."
4,"Native Americans are human, too","The author maintains that it is racist and dehumanizing to treat native Americans as though they were preternaturally beyond the everyday needs and desires of mankind everywhere.In that spirit, the book does a marvelous job in dissecting the mythology and realities of Indian cultures and their relationships to wildlife and the environment.This book is the perfect antidote to the mindless drivel heard so often in most American schools today.(Another good book that touches on this is ""Plagues Of The Mind: The New Epidemic Of False Knowedge"" by Bruce S. Thorton.)"
4,"Worth reading, for a new perspective.","Kudos to Krech for bringing up a new twist on the historical ""crying Indian"" figure everyone is so familiarly brainwashed into identifying with. I was initially shocked and disgruntled by Kreches arguments because I have grown up with a 100% ecological Indian/Dances With Wolves impression of Native Americans. However, the book is stocked with evidence claiming the alternative, that Native Americans did have negative impacts on the environment possibly comparatively to that of the European settlers. Krech did a fabulous job avoiding the use of glittering generalities when presenting arguments. However, at times he almost seems to argumentative (with himself) which is why I give the book only four stars--he tended to write to the critics. At some points he tends to have random arguments, but overall, it is a fascinating piece, which brings up new ideas on the subject in a sensitive way."
1,Sad History,"I notice that the earlier review of 'learned' E. N. Anderson is very careful in maintaining a politeness to 'learned' Dr. Krech. Both men, however, seem to be victims of their education. The book is indeed biased. It will be welcomed by all those who wish to corroborate their mindset belief that the Native Americans were an inferior race who needed to be pushed aside by the superiority of Western culture. For the reader who sincerely seeks out truth, I would suggest these books: Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond; A Peoples History of the United States by Howard Zinn; Lies My Teacher Told Me by James W. Loewen; and The Only World We've Got by Paul Shepard."
2,"Myth, not a lot of history",Not much to say about this type of thing without becoming overly political. I think these kinds of books should be written by the people they purport to represent. We are passing judgement on a way of life so vastly different from the Western European way and through a filter of a couple of centuries.
2,Jukebox America,"If you are a fan of jukeboxes or music recorded on 45's, be aware of this book. I own a jukebox and have about 1,000 45's and didn't particularly like it. If our hero had been my age (60), liked all 50's music, then I might have identified with him and his story. Instead he was a 30's something with a yuppy mentality searching for a holy grail that doesn't exist except in his own mind. I empathized with his sadness about the loss of a bygone era, but that was about it. He threw in a part about searching for the real Elvis and here is where I thought he really missed his mark. It would be like me writing about Rudolph Valentino with no first hand knowledge of the man. Nothing was learned here. I also got tired of his political commentary along the way."
1,Can't teach myself to sing,"I didn't know at the time, but I thought I could actually teach myself to sing so I bought this book. Maybe if you play the piano or you are very talented, that is possible, but nothing beats taking lessons. In stuff such as acting, dancing, or singing, it is very difficult to learn by reading. These things are usually learn by doing since they all involve movement of some sort."
4,Not bad for a beginner,This setup was pretty good for a young beginner. Everything worked as promised and seemed well built. Shipping was good as was the price compared to other sets.
1,not worth the trouble,"This was bought for my 12 year-old son for Christmas. I got it so he could experiment and learn. He is very musical, but didn't want to spend too much money. Christmas morning was a disappointment. He plugged in the guitar and it didn't work. Then he tried his brother's amp and it worked in that one if it was plugged in just so. After a few months use and it completely does not work. NEVER will I buy another instrument off the internet! I have to see it and try it out. It is worth the extra money to buy a good one with a name you can trust. All my son got for Christmas is an amp and a guitar that I couldn't even sell for parts. Keep in mind too the return policy on this puppy is thirty days and if it poops out after that too bad. Oh wait, they'll email you ways you could trouble shoot to fix it. DON'T BUY THIS. SPEND THE EXTRA AT A LOCAL SHOP AND GET A QUALITY INSTRUMENT."
3,Somewhat Lacking Biography,"Although, it is, I believe,the only stand alone biography of Oliver Hardy to date, the book is somewhat lacking. I wanted to learn more about Hardy than what this book told me. I'm assuming that the fact Hardy was long dead when this book was written is one of the reasons it is not as thorough as it otherwise might have been. First hand accounts, at the time of writing, must have been rather slim. It is an easy read and is always worth while for the avid Laurel and Hardy fan. Lets hope a more in-depth look at Hardy's life will be published soon. Although Hardy was less on the creative side on their films together, he was an excellent actor and comedian. You could never have had Laurel and Hardy without him!"
5,Wonderful!,"I must admit, Oliver Hardy was always my favorite of the two, and I was so pleased to find this biography of him. If you can manage to track it down, it's well worth it. Very well researched, with lots of new information and photos. Very well done."
5,Listen only if you like to ROCK!,"I personally think this is one of the most under-rated albums of it's time. With Steve Stevens on guitar, this album rocks, and is worth every penny. I can listen to it over and over and over. If you like 80's rock, you have to have this album."
1,Just creepy,Creepy and boring. There is a segment on one video of just shots of feet while there is slow sexy saxophone music playing in the background. This is like a video someone would create as a joke making fun of baby videos. Very little cohesion or sense here. Weird shots of people playing with their babies. One dad looking miserable like he got dragged there and another with greased up hair and a handlebar mustache who is just way too excited. Maybe he time traveled from 1920 and is happy to have running water. I don't know. Don't but unless you want your baby to grow up to have a handlebar mustache and a foot fetish.
1,TOO SHORT,In an ocean of pseudo-educational videos this bunch falls short. Really short. Each of the three discs features two classic nursery rhymes. Thats right two for each disc.Sing the rhyme see some characters play out the rhyme and 4 1/2 minutes your out the door. And on a scale of fun? . . . . BOR-R-RING.....
2,this product is highly overated,"after purchasing phonics and reading, rock and learn ages 4 and up for me 6 years old i discovered that my 2 year old and my 8 mnt old daughters where quet exited about the dvd so i purchased the hooked on baby dvd 3 pack only to discover that the 8 mnt old was not interested in non of them because they are not exiting enough for her, anything on the dvd can be manually done at home these hooked on baby dvds are a big disapointment redardless of the cost babies like things that exite them even the songs are booring."
5,She's hooked on it!,"Our daughter LOVES this DVD series; admitedly, it was an ""oops"" order from our children's book club, but when I popped the discs in when she was about 5 months old, she went crazy. She loves the characters and the graphics, and loves the music. She is now 11 months old, and she will grab the DVD cases and point at the TV, indicating that she wants to watch one. We also have the book set and the CD, and I don't believe that the books are worth it--few words and not very engrossing, but the CD has the same songs as the DVDs and we listen to it in the car. And I will admit the tunes are pretty catchy, so it doesn't get on my nerves, either."
5,Hooked on baby,"Great interactive sing alongs. I learned alot teaching my son. He thought I was a little crazy, singing patty cake,muffinf man and pointing. Great buy."
1,Too short,These movies are way too short they should have put it all on one disk. The majority of each movie is for the parents. It would be better if one movie was for the kids and one movie for parents. Its a bit boring by the time my child gets interested in it its over.
1,QUICKLY THROWN TOGETHER. NOTHING LIKE THE REAL DAT,I HAVE TAKEN THE DAT AND THIS BOOK IS NOT RECOMMENDED AS A MAIN STUDY GUIDE. MINIMALLY HELPFUL AT BEST. IT'S TOO BAD SOMEONE CANNOT PUT TOGETHER A DECENT DAT STUDY GUIDE.
4,Gorgeous Choral Music,"Eric Whitacre is an amazing composer. He uses just the right amount of tension and release in his chord structures, creating the kind of beauty in music that gives you goose bumps. Some of the cluster chords and progressions are absolutely breathtaking. If you have ever sung in a choir or enjoy choral music, you will understand and appreciate the talent used to sing cluster chords as in tune as the choir on this CD. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes choral music and anyone else who would like to expand their level of music listening."
5,"""Cloudburst"" is a beautiful cd","I bought ""Cloudburst"" because I was excited to find that Eric Whitacre had his acapella music on CD. I first was introduced to his music back in 2001 in my second year of college. We sang his piece ""Water Night"". This music touched me so deeply, that I knew I was on the right path for singing as my career. This song makes me know why I sing. I love his compositions with dissonance. It touches my spirit. I bought this CD, and was giddy when I received it. I have listened to it non-stop and cry every time I hear his songs. He was truly inspired and this will move anyone who listens to it. I especially love from this CD: ""I thank you God for this most amazing day"", ""Sleep"", ""When David heard"", ""Water Night"", ""A Boy and a Girl"", and ""Lux aurumque""."
2,Eric Whitacre: Cloudburst and other choral works,"The speed and efficiency in receiving this product was excellent. I personallydid not care for the music in this CD. For me, it was all very slow andboring !Eric Whitacre is extremely creative though and I may try another one of his CD's.Or I may not."
2,Hand-held calculator,"This calculator looked like exactly what I wanted - small, portable, simple. But, as some others said, loading the paper is impossible and the instructions are not at all helpful. I never figured out how to feed the paper through and am planning to return it. This is a disappointment because any of the other paper-print calculators I've seen are about twice as big."
4,Canon Printing Calculator,"I love this little calculator. No cord to fight. I can use it anywhere. The only problem I have is that I can't figure out how to load the tape. I'll have my grandson do it. He's good at stuff like that. When that gets done, it will be perfect."
3,"Love it, but the paper is just ridiculously hard to load","I wanted to love this little thing. And it is really great in almost every way. Why oh why did you make it so hard to load the paper, Canon? It's so unnecessary. It would have been so easy to make the paper easy to load. I guess it's not a fatal flaw, but it sure is annoying."
3,OK but has some problems,"its a great divice.only problem is to feed the paper it take really long!!!!otherwise it works perfectly, for a great price."
4,"Great reference, a must have for serious bible research","While not completely exhaustive, it covers a tremendous range of topics with enough information to answer casual questions while pointing to further reference material for indepth study. A great starting place for almost any religious topic!"
3,Not what I expected,"I purchased this book as a quick reference for our bible history lessons -all pics are small, low quality black and white...I'll probably have a hard time explaining/describing some things and places...the maps show only ""back then"" I see no help as to where something is today. This ""pictorial"" bible dictionary is too complicated for even this grown woman to use as a quick reference. My advice would be to save your money and purchase a bible map book, a bible dictionary, and a picture book all separately as I will have to now....guess that's what I get for being cheap!"
5,Great Book,"Pretty interesting book, it meet the requirments i need, explanation clear, conscise. book came the required time specified will recomend"
2,One of the least of the greatest,"Do yourself a favor. Buy every American Records JC release and the complete sun sessions, Folsom Prison Live, San Quentin Live, perhaps even a boxed set, and avoid this release. Even for a totally obsessive JC fan such as I, is disappointing. Save for the two Springsteen songs included and a good song about the civil war, this album is unimpressive. Rick Rubin came along too late to save this one. JC is the greatest, but not on ""Johnny 99."""
5,JOHNNY CASH IS THE GREATEST,"JOHNNY CASH IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ENTERTAINERS. THEY DON'T MAKE EM LIKE THEY THAT MUCH ANYMORE.I AM TRYING TO CONTACT HIM BECAUSE OF A FAMILY MATTER. MY DAD IS 70 AND LOVES HIS MUSIC. HE IS RELATED TO JOHNNY CASH ON TE RIVERS SIDE OF HIS FAMILY. HE TRAVELED FROM TEXAS TO MEET HIM ,BUT MISSED HIM. IT WOULD MEAN THE WORLD TO HIM TO BE ABLE TO MEET HIM.CLINT HOLMES ALSO RELATED HAS SPOKE WITH HIM OFTEN ABOUT JOHNNY. IF POSSIBLE PLEASE CONTACT ME FOR HIM. THANK YOU SO MUCH BRENDA (RIVERS) ROGERS.THIS IS A CONSTANT DREAM OF HIS.(MASON RIVERS) THANK YOU BRENDA ROGERS"
5,Great to keep on hand for desserts!,"This deal on Amazon with the Prime free shipping, and/or the even cheaper subscription is very tempting if you make a lot of desserts with this like we do. One of our favorites is layered graham crackers, this pudding mixed with frozen whipped topping, and topped with a can of melted chocolate frosting. Lots of stores are discontinuing name brands, so this is a great item to buy here."
5,Slick High-Tech Action for this Book!,Sucked in and loved this one from the start. The author spins a great tale of murder and terror thats breeds mayhem through the internet. Check this one out!
5,Great Book.,This is a great book on leadership. It is very well organized and each main point is backed by scripture.
3,A Reviewer,"I was reading the reviews, and noticed one by gaibear2 whowas quite disturbed by the book, or so it seemed.He shouldlearn how to spell if he is going to proclaim to be a scholorof sorts. But for us who do not know much about such things,I thought the book was fine. Especially the poetic tale inside. As far as the giant stuff goes, oh well, so be it.And I did see that one word he was talking about mispelled.But I'm no perfectionist, so no big thing. The book was notShakespear, or did the author proclaim it to be I think. Keep the good work up, it was most interesting."
5,The Poetic Tale is Pulitzer Prize stuff.,"I was in New York a few weeks ago, and hearad the book was an entry for a Pultizer Prize in Letters, for the Poetic tale inside of it. I read it, and it was great, the tale that is, although the rest of the book did not interest me. Someone asked me if the facts are true; how would I know, go ask the author, it was a poetic tale with angelic beings in it for god sake."
3,Nice compact and simple Cook top,"The cook top is good quality. I love that it folds up. I wish the burners would change colors some how. Only real complaint is they ship in the original box with all the advertising on the out-side. Not so great when your child sees it on the porch before you, merry christmas."
2,Disappointed in quality,"I was excited to receive this item for my son's birthday since he loves to watch me cook and seems interested. He had only had it for 3 days and the clock hands had already fallen off. They weren't functional to begin with and were so loose that they would just spin around, but I didn't expect them to completely come off. I am hoping the other pieces stay on but I'm not too hopeful after reading some of the other reviews. I read reviews before my purchase and was prepared that the clock hands would be ""loose"" and spin but didn't think they would actually fall off. We also purchased a cookware set by Alex and are having problems with that coming apart too. I'm not sure I will purchase Alex products again."
2,Disappointed with the quality,"I guess I expected too much for the low price. As another reviewer pointed out, the clock hands just spin around. I also assume that the red knobs are supposed to lock the back in place? They, too, just spin around. There was also a big scratch on the inside. Overall, it just looked poorly made. I bet my daughter would have played with it anyway, but I don't think it's worth the money."
5,Kids Play Stove,"My grand daughter plays with this toy all the time very durable and your pricing is great, your always a couple of bucks cheaper than other websites. Happy and loyal Amazon shopper."
2,falls apart!,"I really like the looks of this toy, and like Alex toys in general but the backsplash wood piece and the red hook bar piece come unglued and doesn't fit back together properly for me to fix it! Quite annoying since it's perfect for our small play space in our NYC apartment. I wish I had chosen something else!"
5,Excellent & Compact!,"This play stovetop is perfect for situations where small size and easy storage are key criteria! Its sturdy wood construction promises to be a big long-term plus, and it happens to fit beautifully atop a rolling 3-drawer plastic cart in primary colors, both bonuses as well. Thanks to the addition of several medium-small stacking bins placed next to the cart when grandchildren are with us, the red drawer can function as a pretend oven, the blue one as a fridge, and the yellow one for ""other stuff"" of their choosing. When they aren't, the stovetop can stay in its original box for protected storage, and the cart provides plenty of space for all the play food, pots and pans, chef outfit, etc. I've found that Alex Toys manufactures a number of great products and stands behind them - I'm happy to say this is no exception!"
4,"A good ""grandma"" buy.","Well made, fun and colorful. It folds flat like a suitcase for easy storage at grandma's house where there is not room to keep toys out when the kids are not here. Sometimes a little tricky to get it open, but well worth the effort."
4,Hitting the Wall is surprisingly good reading.,"I was encouraged to read this book because a friend had breast cancer. This book was astoundingly good reading. I laughed, I cried, I learned. It's written with with wit and without self consciousness. So, it's honest, informative, and at times very funny. I bought 5 copies to give friends, 4 of whom are fighting cancer or are survivors. All thanked me profusely for such a helpful book. Barbara Glacel deserves kudos for such a good and useful book."
4,An eye-opener from a cancer survivor,"Barbara Pate Glacel's graphic account of her fight against breast cancer is riveting, and recommended for anyone, but especially for women, most of whom, I think, fear breast cancer above all diseases. As the wife of an Army general stationed in Belgium, Ms. Glacel faced explaining her situation in a language not her own to hospital personnel, physicians, and friends. Her account of the obstacles she faced is poignant, sometimes humorous, and always direct. Her family's reactions are recorded frankly, and the support she received from family and friends through phone, e-mail, and letters meant much to her--she e-mailed friends when she had strength for little else. She provides useful information at the end of her book about breast cancer organizations, recommends books on breast cancer and healing, and her 'Suggestions for Survivors' are especially useful."
5,A Fascinating Journey,"As a fellow breast-cancer survivor, I found Barbara's book fascinating and could not put it down once I started it. I would recommend this book to anyone who has just been diagosed with breast cancer, as well as anyone who has gone through it already. I found it interesting to learn about the feelings she went through during the various stages of the journey from the first suspicious test through completion of treatment and follow-up. She also has an excellent section at the end of the book which provides an extensive list of information and support resources."
4,An Easy to Read Book with excellent references,The author fights back at the fear and encourages her readers to do the same by supplying easily accessed references and providing an email network. The books reads easy and lets the reader share in the author's struggle and ultimate triumph as Barbara Glacel aggressively takes the helm of her own ship and sails through the dark waters of an all too-common disease. Humor adds the light touch to offset the seriousness and makes the pages turn fast.
5,A MUST READ,"A must read. Janet and Wade fell in love through high school and in University. With the jealous motives of a supposed friend they break off and Janet has no idea what constitutes the breakup. Ten years later they meet up again, but harder to get together because they find they still love each other, yet Wade still does not trust Janet. This book is a tear jerker and makes you feel that there is hope out there for lost loves.Winters spins an unbelievable story set in Utah and I enjoyed it very much and all four times that I have read."
1,incompatible with modern operating systems,Bought this over a year ago. It is incompatible with win xp and vista. Springer has not released a software patch to make it usable with modern windows. Springer could not help over the phone or email because product is apparently german made. Product should not be for sale because no one uses win 95 and it won't work in any other setting.
3,Debut of this NZ alt-country-bluesy-punk quartet,"This first album by this obscure New Zealand band introduces their blend of countrified alternative rock with occasional flurries of feedback and distortion. If you like the Cowboy Junkies in their more amphetamine-driven state, or the willfully amateurish combination of vocal squawks and primitive blues-punk, then the mix of more delicate female-sung ballads and male-howled laments will please you. It's noticeably more rudimentary than their last and best album, A Dream of the Sea, but nonetheless it's consistent, never dull, and fits a lazy, restless afternoon mood. If you have their other two albums, finish your collection with this one."
1,It could have been alot better!,The cage match and Last man standing were the only matches that made this ppv good.B-dust vs. G-dust com on that was the worst match on there. The hard-core match was bad.Take my advice and some other peoples RENT it.
4,Not worth the money but still pretty good.,"I will give thumbs up to the last man standing match but thumbs way down for the cage match.Dont buy,RENT."
3,Solid WWF pay-per-view,"St. Valentine's Day Massacre was a good effort by the WWF and its superstars. The McMahon-Austin cage match was the reason I purchased it and I wasn't disappointed. Rock vs. Mankind was an enjoyable match to watch but you couldn't help but be slightly disappointed by the ending. Val Venis vs. Ken Shamrock, Triple H/X-Pac vs. Chyna/Kane and the hardcore tilt with Snow and Holly were all good bouts. The tag title match was decent but I could have done without the Goldust-Bluedust match. The Bossman vs. Midion did nothing for me as well. Overall, I would recommend purchasing the video as I have no regrets about my purchase. Solid card with some spectacular spots."
3,Worth the money just for the cage match,"ST. Valentine's Day Massacre was very entertaining, especially the last hour. The undercard wasn't that good but the last 3 matches which includes HHH & Xpac vs. Kane & Chyna, Rock vs. Mankind in a last man standing match, and Austin vs. Vince McMahon in a steel cage were very impressive. This video also contains the debut of Paul ""Big Nasty"" Wight as he interferes in the main event. The negatives were the weak first hour and a half with the exception of the hardcore title match and mainly Michael Cole on commentating was terrible as he miscalled everything and over hyped the whole show. He came off like Tony Shavione in WCW. Overall a good video to add to the In Your House collection."
5,All in all a great PPV !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"St.Valentines Day Massacre was GREAT.Here's my review.... 1)GoldDust vs. BleuDust.Good oppening match (B-) 2)Bob Holly vs. Al snow (Hardcore title)Good hardcore match,almost went in the river.Pretty cool.(B+) 3)Medion vs. Bossman...Just plain BORING....(D-) 4)Val Venis vs. Shamrock (special Ref. Billy Gunn) Funny match...Billy Gunn was hilarious!!! the match itself was pretty good. (B+) 5)HHH/Xpac vs. Chyna/Kane.. Really Good match.Chyna took some pretty nice falls.I was inpressed.(A-)6)Rock vs. Mankind (I quit match) this was the best action of the night.I loved it... Mankind took some HUGE bumps.The Rock was in Great!! Pretty weird ending...all in all (A+) 7)AUSTIN vs. MCMAHON (steel cage) This was of my favorite match of the night.McMahon took some BIG falls.THis was a GREAT PPV.YOU must BUY IT NOW!!!"
4,pretty good ppv leading to wrestlemania,ok let me just say the last man standing was not all that good but the cage mathc was awsome
2,Horrible in your house,The last man standing the hardcore match and the cage match were the only semi good matches in the whole thing.
4,It was a great in your house.,The best match was the hardcore title match.I liked when they brawled to the mississippi river.
4,A viewer from mass,You Can't go wrong with matches like stone cold vs. Vince or mankind and the rock in a last man standing match. The hardcore title match was awsome.Both men went into the mississipi river. Check this out.
2,it sucked,"This PPV was horrible, the last man standing match was boring and dragged on, the cage match was good, and the only reason why this PPV even gets 2 stars is because during the Shamrock/Val Venis match Shamrock's sister goes face to face with Shamrock and she hit him, just before the slap if you listen closely you can hear Shamrock say ""Slap Me"" in his normal voice reminding her what to do at that moment, that was funny."
1,St. Valentines Day lay on your back.,"This is the worst pay per view I have ever seen. The Rock and Mankind spent most thier match laying on their backs, and whats the point of a steel cage match if hardly any of the match is spent in the cage, and one of the people in the match is the lousy owner of the company. I could have gone to a bar on the right night and seen better action. I thought the Hardcore title match was the best match just because it happened in the Mississippi River, which made for an interesting situation. I couldn't wait for this to get over. I just may sell my copy soon."
4,A Good Effort,"This Feb. 1999 PPV was certainly not the best the WWF put out that year but it certainly was not worthless either. Mankind & The Rock battled in a ""Last Man Standing"" Match for the WWF title, an incredible brawl too, and Vince McMahon vs. Steve Austin in a steel cage was better than expected. This match features McMahon taking a brutal fall from the cage (especially for a 54 year old man!) Recomended, but some parts might be boring to some people, i.e. Big Bossman vs. Mideon."
3,just rent dont buy,well this was pretty good ppv. the rock/mankind match was good. shamrock and venis match was a bit to long. hhh and xpac/kane and chyna was pretty good. but the best match was austin vs.mcmahon in a cage match. but the other matches are all duds.
5,WWF St. Valentines Day Massacre,This Video is the bestThe matches were awesome espically the main event Stone Cold Steve Austin v.s. Vince McMahon in a stell cage wit Paul Wright Big Show interfering.
1,Love this hairdryer - but it broke in less than a month,"This is a great hair dryer . . while it was working. It is heavier than my other dryer, but it dries my curly hair smooth in record time. After less than a month of use something came loose inside and I have to return it under the mfg. warranty. I bought the dual voltage model for an upcoming trip to India."
1,Thoroughly disappointing,"If it ain't broke..... what were they thinking at Pollenex???!!! The old version of this showerhead had some great settings, the handy lever to save water, etc... This new version must be designed for people over 6 ft tall, since it's positioned WAY above shower curtain level and it is top heavy, and swivels around on its own if any water pressure occurs. Within a week the ring holding it to the pipe cracked so I'm returning the piece of junk. I'm totally bummed as this was one of the few showerheads with a nice strong central flow (instead of the misty thing etc..) any suggestions for something similar to the old version???"
1,Poor Design,I just purchased the Pollenex DM209 for my mother who just had heart surgery. I found that it was poorly designed in that when the shower head is placed in the holder to use as conventional shower head it is top heavy and could either fall on the person taking a shower and in the case of my mother do physical damage. In the conventional shower position it is also leveraged in such a way with the top of the head more than 6 inches above the holder that it could also damage the water pipe causing leakage and internal waterdamage to the bath wall. The curved design of the hand held shower head makes it very difficult to hold as opposed to a straight handle style.(for a person with Multiple Sclerosis as I have) Pollenex needs to redesign this product.
1,"No parts, No service, hard to locate for assistance","After several HOURS trying to find who owned Pollenex, Holmes Group slipped me a number to Conair 800-528-9384 where they said parts aren't available, but she did replace my DM209-0303BN head at no charge. I must return the defective unit.All for a 39 cent ""o"" ring with a flange. (Mine had only a half a flange which caused the head to malfunction when turned to a different nozzle.Don't lose that number!\KNFKearney, NE"
4,Love it,We really love the shower head. It has a lot of pressure and that is what we like. We also love the fact you can adjust the pressure on each setting. There is only one thing wrong with this item. The bracket breaks very easy and you can't buy that item. We have had several of these shower heads and that part is the only thing that goes bad. If anyone knows where you can get one please let us know.
1,Wrong picture,"The picture is not what is actually received. I had the older model and have been searching for the same one. When I saw the picture on the webpage, I was so happy to have found it. The one I received is not what was pictured. Needless to say, I will be returning the item. I also suggest the correct picture of the product be displayed on the webpage."
5,I MAY HAVE TO GIVE UP SHOWERING,"I was fortunate enough to buy an extra DM209, back when they were available.Last month, I finally had to start using it. To be on the safe side, I thoughtI had better get another back-up. Unfortunately, it appears I am already too late!I just don't feel I can really get the soap out of my hair with these new ""low flow"" shower heads. I feel I am living the episode of ""Seinfeld"" in which they faced the same ""low flow"" dilemma. Again, unfortunately for me, I don't have access to any ""black market shower head dealers."" If I DID, I would not hesitate to buy ANOTHER POLLENEX DM209 4-DIAL HAND HELD SHOWER HEAD!"
2,Old Dm 209,"I agree with you, the old Dm 209 is the absolute best shower head ever! Perhaps if everyone who feels this way lets Conair/Pollenex know how you feel we can get them to bring it back. Go to www.conair.com and use the contact us feature."
5,Wonderful Work Again.,"The story centering around Rafe and Ari in his jungle was excellent. I was gratefull to see the maturing of Ari in a smooth story line. Many of the stories we read today just jump right into the characters as full blown individuals. We don't know who they really are. In this story, the characters fully developed within the storyline. It was a no stop reading marathon for me. I enjoyed it to its fullest."
4,4.5,"I was there at Manadaly Bay the night this concert was filmed and had been waiting anxiously for nearly two years to see this concert again. And this DVD does not dissapoint.This DVD contains most of the compositions from that concert and the DVD does an exellent job of capturing the energy that was radiating through the arena that evening. Watching the DVD was like taking me back to that night, reliving that awesome concert once again. This concert is slightly different from LATA and Tribute in that this is more of a variety, jamming type of concert than the more classical type of concert he did previously. I also thought Yanni had polished his music quite a bit since I last saw him in his ethnicity tour early 2004 at Raleigh-Durham.I gave it 4.5 stars only because Yanni cut out several of my favorite compositions from that concert...! Other than that, every Yanni fan should enjoy this DVD."
5,Outstanding!,"I can only sum up this DVD in one word...INCREDIBLE!To watch Yanni interact with the musicians and to see the musicians interact with one another is SO much fun to watch. And to see the pride and the enjoyment in Yanni's eyes as he hears his music played was such a thrill to me. I can't imagine being in his shoes and to hear the music being brought to life. You could tell from all of the musicians that THIS was the music that they were meant to play and THIS was their moment.Never has a concert DVD thrilled me as much as this one did. I was truly enthralled and mesmerized by the entire concert (much more so then just listening to the CD...if you even remotely like the CD, you will LOVE this DVD!!!)"
3,Yanni's Concert,Chose this rating as it did not compare to Yanni at the Acropolus. Music was good and had my guests rocking.
5,It is EXCELLENT!,"This Live Concert is just Excellent. Yanni introduces advanced technology on doing this presentation at the Mandeley, not only with music but light effects. Many of the songs were performed on prior albums but they are worthy to listen and watch once more. I recommend it."
5,Another Wonderful Music Video From Yanni,"As usual, this music video is another spectacular performance by Yanni and his band. It is definitely a must see DVD."
5,SPECTACULAR,"Oh Boy He did it again,If you think you like the other concerts then you must own this one, His music sounds better,You feel the passion He has for His music,somehow it seems like He polish His music,His musicians are very professional,no wonder He has musicians from all over the world,Yanni you are the best."
5,The best musical talent of all his concerts till date!,"This recording of Yanni's concert in Mandalay Bay, Las Vegas just blew me away! Although the previous concert recordings were great (Acropolis, Taj Mahal, Forbidden City), this most recent version of his already famous pieces sounds the best!..and this is not just due to the better technology used. Yanni seems to have slightly edited his renowned compositions to expose the incredible talent of his new recruits, taking the musical pieces to a breathtaking level! This is particularly noticed in 'Until the last moment', where one of his new Armenian violinists takes you on a deep emotional journey with what seem to be Arabian hymns! That alone was worth the entire DVD for me!If you're a Yanni fan, you're in a for an unsurpassed treat with this DVD!"
5,Awesome,What a genius! This man is a master at what he does. I bought it as a gift for my dad. He loves it. And so do I!
2,Disappointed,"This Yanni concert was a letdown. Should be renamed ""Yanni's Band in Concert"". They are excellent musicians, but after seeing 3 Yanni live shows (and owning the Acropolis and Tribute videos), I was expecting this to be a Yanni performance backed up by his band, not the other way around. I know there will never be a concert as outstanding as the one at the Acropolis, but maybe he can go back to the same format for his future concerts and cd's. The fans come to see him perform and hear his music, not just his talented band."
2,Keeping the Hubby Happy,"Not a real big Yanni Fan, but My Husband is...he loves this....I enjoy the fact that he is happy!"
2,Its OK at best,I've always been on the border with Yanni. I had hope this DVD would help. It did not. If you really like Yanni you will probably like this DVD. If not go elsewhere.
5,The Best,"If you come across a better performance and production quality than this DVD, please let me know. After watching this DVD several times, I become paranoid that I may not be able to enjoy another DVD if it's not close to the caliber of this one. My 12-yr old son, who never sit still and finished a DVD before, let alone a ""musical"" DVD, watched this DVD 2 consecutive times, back to back. Amazing."
5,Another Yanni's great concert....,Yanni has been quiet for a while but I was so happy to see this concert. Great new songs as well new renditions of some of the old ones. Another classic...
5,Yanni Live - The Concert Event,"What can I say? This is YANNI at his best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was there, so it makes it even better."
4,Yanni - Live The Concert Event,An Audio & Visual delight!Yanni has brought a whole load of musicians together from the world over to perform his music with him. Recorded in DTS sound and filmed using Hi Def cameras to produce a clear widescreen picture.The lighting used at the concert is just brilliant and adds to the entertainment it gives.My only comment is that he allows the musicians to get a bit carried away with themselves detracting from his music a little.However this would not stop me buying this DVD or recommending it to anyone .Thoroughly recommended.Dave BGreat Britain
5,Very awesome!,"The Dvd Yanni Live- The concert Event arrived within a weeks time. It was in perfect condition,and im very happy witht he results as it was receaved. I waited all week for it to ariveand was very excited, If your a true yanni fan you will enjoy this till your hearts contint :)"
3,Yanni is Great,"Not anything like his World Concerts , but still great with a handpicked few musicians"
3,GOOD but not that good,"Yanni shows are an experience. The concert event was good but not as good as earlier shows, such as the ones at the acropolis and taj mahal. Still it is worth a watch."
3,outstanding performer very bad recording,The show is out standing - the sound is poor the volume level is going up and down during the concert!
2,The Acropolis Is Much Better,"I guess I'm pretty much a minority on this, but I'm extremely disappointed with this concert. Almost everything else I've got by Yanni is expansive, complex, and relaxing New Age music. This concert is much less so, most of the songs having a jazz (or maybe world) feel rather than a New Age feel. The orchestra is very much missed, too."
5,Excelente!!!,"Es un concierto excelente, lo mejor que he escuchado de Yanni.La calidad de los músicos que lo acompañan, el sonido, en fin es un concierto que vale la pena escuchar muchas veces"
5,Yanni is a Lengend,Everything Yanni produces is excellent ! He has the uniqueness of an uplifting and soothing sound to instrumental and vocal music. His concerts are world-class.
5,Excellent Railroad History,"As a New England/New York railroad buff, I enjoy reading well-written histories of local lines. This was one of the best, and must be the definitive history of the O&W. Even if you've never heard of the line, pick up this book for a great read about a road that may never have been famous, but always had heart."
5,Renata sings Spontini,"Renata Tebaldi, one of the few real artists, is now can be heard in a very interesting and special role, that is not from her basic repertire. Her voice, as always, is pure and secure, and as beautiful as it can be, and her style is very dramatic and full of passion. This time the melodies are not so well known, but Renata sings them so naturally, that one may feel them familiar. The whole performance is effective, containing nice arias and great finales. A few pictures in the booklet and really good sound restoring. A 'MUST' for any Tebaldi fans, and for the lovers of 'opera rara'."
2,Trains stations: whistle stops in US,"I really was looking to find a book that had the facts and the pictures to go with them! This was NOT it!!!!There is a lot of interesting information in this book, and it does cover a lot of area both historically and geographically. But it's not very well presented. There are also pages and pages with ""fade-in/watermark""backgrounds that distract the reader from the pleasures available in the book's overall impact.Also many of the detailed photos of the depots and stations are in shadow and not very good quality. Overall, the impact of the book is lessened by the low quality of the photographs which should have been its best feature."
1,Very light duty,"The chisel tips are uneven, the plastic sleeves and the chrome finish are not very useful for any purpose other than masking that this is not a good carbon steel set, one of the punches is not straight and the 1/8"" broke after three hammer blows, no kidding.I guess you got the idea; this is the typical ""homeowners quality"" or ""good for the price"" tool very common on these days."
4,DESPERATE SANITY?,"Previously unseen archival footage enhances this probing but affectionate look at William S. Burroughs (""Naked Lunch""), one of the first writers to break the social barriers of queer and drug culture. Burroughs thrashed conservative values and triggered counterculture movements. The soundtrack is by Patti Smith and Sonic Youth. Peter Weller narrates with a bemused detachment. This sharp documentary delves below the surface of a troubled, brilliant and desperately sane author whose influence remains a force."
1,This Phone Sucks! Don't get Sucked in by the Low Price!,"I bought this phone for my college dorm room and it is a complete dissapointment. If I charge it all day, the battery might last for 20 minutes, otherwise, the battery lasts for about 10 minutes. If you are more than 20 feet from the charger, then all you can hear is static. The only good thing about this phone is that when you can hear, its pretty clear."
3,Good basic knowledge for statistical decision making,"My edition is a paperback, but everything else about it appears to be the same. Meant to be a supplementary text, it contains no problems or workbook functions. Rather, it moves briskly through the different approaches that can be taken to calculate the outcome of different decisions, with an intent to assist someone making decision-management decisions.The opening is quaintly anachronistic, making the case for the use of researchers and computers in decision-making to a management world that was just beginning to wake up and smell the coffee.The book itself is as clear as it could possibly be for a rather dense subject; it is chock full of examples, and presents each approach succinctly."
5,good,good buy for the quality of product. Helped me save some money and get what I needed at the same time.
3,Does the job,The chain seems to be ok. Be sure you measure the distance you need before buying or you might end up short like i did.
2,"Rich premise, poorly executed","I've only seen the pilot and the second episode, but so far I'm not as impressed as I had hoped. Though the idea is loaded with possibilities, the execution is poor, from clunky dialog that lurches from the absurd to the trite (what little girl would say, when referring to the rain, ""It's only a light shower""?)o poor acting and X-Files-like stories. There's an interesting and recent French movie called ""They Came Back."" You might call it an anti-zombie film about what would happen if the dead rose up from their graves and returned to their towns. They haven't decomposed or anything like that; they're as they were just before they died. How would society reintegrate them?The 4400 pointlessly complicates the interesting questions posed by the premise, by giving the returnees special powers that, naturally, work against them. I was hoping that The 4400 would be a little deeper than it is."
2,"X-files meets x-files BUT Mulder, Scully and Wolferine","why this serie stink? :a ) Bad casting,for example the typical cute-little-girl is not cute at all.. seem too psycho and zero cuteness. Many roles are just plain (and stupid) for example the ""i don't known nothing""-boyb ) Story?.... just add some anacronyst people, just some ""smallville-like"" guys with powers and add some troubles and a un-interesting-plot.c ) They are bad actors, with zero charisma!.d ) Surprise factor?.. nope, the history is too predictable, too far to be a ""Taken"" style serie (with lot of surprise).e) Sci-fi but Science."
1,quality let down-PRINCE RAFAEL-of London,I guess this is ok for those who can lip read owing to the very poor quality of 'speach ' sound and to my amazement there are no sub titles.These have been a fixture for some time.If there was not a demand for subtitles they wouls not be provided.Obviously the producers of this very inferior set are not interested in selling a second series.I alas am barred from buying further outputs as I could not follow at least half of the diologuePRINCE RAFAEL
5,Humanity Revealed,"The 4400 is a very realistic depiction of the way we treat or mistreat people who have experienced something so extraordinary, we can't relate. And even if we can relate, we are wary of their intent, because they are not us. We only know what's inside OUR minds, which may or may not be what any or all of the 4400 is feeling or thinking. I never miss an episode, and want this in my collection. We can always find things in the script we would have written a different way, but over all, this series is the best and the worst of all of humanity on both sides of the divide. It's gripping; it's thrilling; it's reality shrouded in a SciFi premise."
4,Brilliant!!,"One of the best series I've ever seen. It has a lot of interesting aspects: mistery, fantasy, drama, surprises... Once you get hooked, you just can't stop looking for more."
3,Not bad and no subtitles,"First a disapointment, the DVD set comes with *no* subtitles at all (no English, nothing).Besides, this SF story is rather interesting, sounds a bit like the M. comics books. The general story plot being ""why did they come (back) different?"" - while the question differs, the show is quite Lost-like (if you liked ""Lost"" you'll love ""4400"").Acting is good, and special effects are usually not bad. But at some times the investigators don't act logically and situations are not always consistent. It is even irritating to watch a wonderfully endowed person illogically/incredibly doomed to a tragic end ; producers may have had a hard time to figure out how to deal with these empowered characters... (well, and what about the 4380 others we don't see...)The show will please the Idealist dreaming about a perfect world from a magic wand."
4,The 4400 Season 1 and 2,Saw just one episode of the USA series season 3.Went immediately to buy season 1 and 2. Can't wait for season 3 on DVD. The story lines are quite inventive and hold the attention of a discerning audience. This is not your regular absurd Sci-Fi. Give it a try!
5,This show is addicting,"I'm glad that this mini series was picked up for another season. The first 5 episodes are excellent. I became addicted to the show when USA aired an all-day marathon of every episode from the beginning. It was so interesting that I watched the entire marathon. The concept is very imaginative and intriguing. The characters are appealing. This show is intelligent and different. It's worth getting into and definitely worth buying the DVD's, especially at this price."
5,Better Than Lost?,"My wife said that - but, I have to admit that this series has everything. Mystery, science fiction, good writing, unexpected twists and turns, and likeable actors. Bravo - something else to watch while waiting for the next season of Lost to finally get here!"
5,4400,This is the 2 hour Pilot everyone was waiting for so long to watch and is well worth the wait. Excellent entertainment!!! Will and have recommended it to many people.
4,Nice concept,"How would you adjust if you came back missing years of your life and everything you knew had changed? This is the premise of this show. If you like x-files, Angel and Buffy this show is perfect for you. It is well written and has interesting characters.It's not just special abilities it's about relationships too. The only flaw of the product is that it's bare. It's a very short season, pilot and four episodes, but the stories are good."
3,don't be fooled !!,It only contains the pilot and the first 4 shows (up to the birth of Richard and Lilly's daughter.The other shows are considered season two.
4,Cheap Price for full first season,"I didn't realize at first that the whole first season was only 5 episodes, with the first one being the length of 2 episodes, but it was only $9, and now I am caught up on the 4400 and able to watch the second season. Good Buy."
2,"Boring, senseless show - this show is only for sci-fi fans..","I heard about this show and the ratings it got on the Pilot episode and decided to watch it from the beginning. Big mistake.I must admit though that I watched the first 4 episodes and with so much to do and better shows to watch, I never cared to watch the last 2, so maybe the final 2 episodes gave viewers some answers as to what exactly was happening with The 4400 and the ones from that group that you actually get to know.But they dragged it so much that by the third episode, you just want to know and are no longer interested in the stories of these freaks.Also, the main characters who were working to find out what the hell was going on were not very interesting.I'd recommend these 5 shows over The 4400 any day:24, Nip/Tuck, Lost, Alias, and The O.C. (which is great if you like young hotties).24 is so much more intriguing. Nip/Tuck is so much more fun. Lost has great characters and Alias is just really cool."
3,"Very, very, VERY average.","This was an excellent idea for a show. Pity about what they came up with. I don't know if they had a very small budget but the effects weren't up to much by today's standards. The storylines seemed to get weaker as the weeks went on. The acting wasn't particularly anything special, merely enough to get by. Like I said, very, very average. There was so much scope here that the writers should have been spoiled for choice, but in the end I didn't really care about any of the characters or seeing any of their situations resolved.When you look at other shows with paranormal, other-worldly elements, like Lost or The X-Files, you realise just how average this really is. Have I said `average' enough yet to get the message across?Don't come to this show expecting anything special, but if you've a few hours to kill and a few bucks to burn, try it. You never know, you might see more than I did."
5,Amazing - Simply Amazing,"This is one of the most amazing series I've ever seen. There are some clunker episodes, but they are few and far between. From concept to creation, this is a great combination of Human Drama, Sci-Fi, Espionage, and Thriller. The ONLY problem with the first season is that you fall in love with some of the characters who don't come back for the 2nd season. By itself, the first season is one of the best single seasons of any series I have ever seen."
3,Good price,"I bought The 4400 because of the Amazon 'deal', it shipped fast and was in good condition, the box edge was a little roughed up, but it was sealed and brand new as described."
5,Good show!,I second that. If you're a fan of X-files or Taken you'll love this series. Too bad it was so short! Let's hope the second season will be as good as the first.
3,The 440 - The Complete First Season,"I enjoyed the movie but am confused, I was able to see a couple episodes on TV and did not see them on the DVD.On TV Lillie has her baby and it is a little like Tabatha on Bewitched.Why was none of this on the DVD?"
4,Seems like a good concept,"We have not watched all the episodes yet, but so far I am okay but not thrilled with the show. I am told it gets better, so we will see!"
3,First season 4400-is that all there is?,"We were very disappointed in the ""First Season"" package. Fewer than 6 episodes!"
5,"Big fan, can't wait till season two","I was a huge fan of Taken and The 4400 reminds me a bit of that movie, with a slightly more rushed feel and an injection of X-Men phenomena. I watched all five episodes straight, I just had to see what happened next."
4,Waiting for the next season...,"Yep, it is worth keeping in mind that the second season will be worth acquiring.The premise is interesting, the acting good, and there are enough people and sub-plots to keep one engaged at several levels."
3,Very Disappointing,I LOVE straylight run! I'm going to see them live AGAIN in Manhattan soon. But I'm really angry with myself for running out ot the store to get this album. Amazing band with a lot of talent but there was nothing unique about this album. I felt like I was listening to half done soundtrack to an inspirational movie. Very christian rock feel to it if you don't count Hands in the Sky. I'm so upset!
2,prepare to be let down,"i love straylight run. their first cd, amazing. so when i saw this new ep in best buy, i immplusively bought it. turns out, major let down. 1. there's no depth to these songs. it's just a few lines repeated over and over. 2. vocally it lacks, he never goes high. it's almost like talking over overly-produced electronic music. 3. this ep has a strong political agenda (anti-war), and that's pretty much all it has to offer. the only decent songs on here are 4, which is off their old cd (better on the old cd as well) and 6, which features the best written lyrics. unfortunately bob dylan wrote it. so spend your 10 bucks a better way; eat three meals at mcdonalds"
1,Discusting,"Straylight Run was great until they had to voice their politicalstance like so many other bands before them. I wish these bands would just shut up and sing instead of tearing our country and troops down by saying ""the war is pointless and politically motivated""So if your about putting this war down and undermining our troops then this is the CD for you."
2,Repairing Furniture,"I really like the easy to follow text. The illustrations are very clear and easy to understand. I really feel comfortable tackling a few of my household projects I have put off for months. Chair joints are loose, reupholstery on some of my furniture, and other basic household repairs. Glad to have this book in my library."
5,EVERYONE NEEDS THIS CD! MINDY IS OUTSTANDING!,"Wow! I was so impressed by Mindy Smith's debut album. She is definitly one of the best female singers anywhere. Her songwriting skills are unbelievable. Mindy's voice is the kind that only comes along once in a lifetime. So do yourself a favor and don't miss out on this CD. I wish I could tell you what the best songs on the album are but EVERY SINGE ONE is my favorite. I couldn't even pick one over another if I tried. Mindy caught my interest by singing ""Jolene"" on a Dolly Parton tribute album so I decided to keep an eye on any material she put out. I was beyond surprised at how great this CD is. I never would have expected something as emotional, thoughtful, and well put-together as Mindy's CD. Support Mindy Smith and go buy this CD as soon as possible!! You will never regret it."
2,One Moment More,"I bought this album for the song title, ""Come to Jesus"" which is a great song. I was a little disappointed in the rest of the album."
2,Pretty average,This CD has 2 good songs on it--Jolene and that Jesus one you hear on the radio. The rest seem like something you'd hear at an open mike night in a college town. Wouldn't buy it again or recommend it to anyone.
3,Shawn Colvin + Jesus = Mindy Smith,"Here's a woman with an ethereal, baby-powder-soft voice and many of the same lyrical swirls and quirks found in a good Shawn Colvin CD. She also does things that Shawn really can't, like sail off in a water-clear soprano version of 'Jolene.' I don't think I've ever heard a better version. Pretty good for a Long Island girl. . .My only negative for this otherwise wonderful debut CD is the ""Club you over the head with Jesus"" first song on the album. The rest of the CD has no particular religious content, so it's a little unclear why flacking for the Big J. is the first order of business.So, all in all a promising debut. If Mindy Smith goes the way of Shawn Colvin, with that beautiful voice and wry lyrics, I'll be collecting every new CD. Alternatively, if she decides to use that gorgeous voice to belt her bible, I'll be a pretty disappointed ex-listener."
1,Do Not Waste Your $$$$ On This Screeching Young Woman!,"The ""famous "" road to---- is paved with good intentions.That is the case here. This is a nice young girl who is unable to carry a note in a bucket.Buy Sarah's Afterglow instead. Spend you hard earned money on a cd that is worth every penny."
4,Smashing Debut,"The long island born and raised singer spent some time in Nashville while recording her debut CD, and the country girl influence mixes well with her New York roots. The deeply religious lead song ""Come to Jesus,"" blends Southern twangs with electric riffs straight out of the east coast boroughs. Besides having a voice with a hint of Joan Osbourne, and uniquely resembling Suzanne Vega, Smith also has a set of pipes that rock without restriction as she sings, ""Worry not my daughters, worry not my sons. Child when life don't seem worth living. Come to Jesus and let him hold you in his arms,"" and then soothes listeners into a calm after the storm with ""Falling."" Smith has a folk-rock sensibility that matches her celtic melodies with an outlook inspired by faith. And she uses her outlook to ripen her songs with an emotional elegance. By the time you're listening to the last note of the closing title song, you may be wishing for one moment more to bathe in the quiet comfort."
5,Truly Awesome CD,"This CD offers a style of music that is soothing, and has lyrics with meaning. I love this CD and HIGHLY recommend it."
4,A great find,"Best Tracks: Falling, Fighting for it All, JoleneOne More Moment shows Mindy Smith's ability to not only write thought provoking songs, but hold the listener captive for each song.Her clear melodic voice is refreshing in songs like Falling and Fighting For It All, and hard driving on tunes like Hard To Know.Mindy Smith's duet with Dolly Parton on Parton's own Jolene is wonderful"
3,Something's missing . . .,"I think this is a great album, especially after hearing her singles in various places.However, what I like the most is also what I like the least. Musically, she is in a style to that of Patty Griffin. I love Patty Griffin, but there's only one.Lyrically, hopeful and inspirational without being blatantly Christian which I'm appreciative for.This is a solid addition to those alt-country fans, but still I feel there's something original missing to this CD."
2,FOLK,"Mindy has a pretty voice and her lyrics are good. I'm not into country but this CD is more folksy which is a nice addition to my CD collection. I can't say I love the CD. I like it. It's okay. Listen to it and if you like it, buy it."
1,Snoozer,"I heard about this cd when I saw the video of 'Jolene' on CMT. This artist's version was so hauntingly beautiful, I just knew the rest of the cd would be great! WRONG! All of the other songs bored me to death.I do not recommend spending dollars on this cd. Just download 'Jolene', which is well worth a listen."
5,Amazing Debut!,I came across Mindy's album by chance while searching for Patty Griffin. This is a fantastic album! Similar to Alison Krauss/Patty Griffin/Jann Arden feel. I hope Mindy has long term plans for more albums because I could definitely get used to this.It's rare for me to come across an album where I like every song - this is one of those exceptions. Every track here is good. My particular favoritesCome To JesusHurricane (reminds me of a guy I fell in love with)It's AmazingHard to Knowand the best - Fighting For It All. Great stuff!
5,Buy this album now!,"This is flat-out the prettiest female vocal CD I have ever heard, and I have purchased plenty and heard more. Do your friends a favor and pick them up a copy today. Today's order will cover my mother, mother-in-law, sister and nephew. Her voice, her lyrics - every song is great."
5,Mindy Smith is an Angel,...And you can tell by her voice. Her voice is haunting in an ethereal sort of way. There may be a lot of people she could be compared to but she is great in her on right. What a phenomenal CD. I hope she reaps all she deserves. I can't wait to see her live.
5,Best Album of the Year!,"Every song on here is a winner.This CD has folk, country & rock songs and they are all great.I can't for Mindy to put out another CD and hopefully I'll see her in concert soon!Buy this CD, it is great!!"
5,One Moment More is One CD More you should own!!,"Mindy Smith has put some marvelously nice tunes together for this CD.""One Moment More"" (the song) is so very beautiful...subtle, mostly just an acoustic guitar with strings building into the bridge. Mindy's voice blends with the music perfectly.""Angel Doves"" is hauntingly beautiful.""It's Amazing"" picks up the tempo, but all of the instruments are wisely used sparingly.""Falling"" gives us another perfect blend of a perfect voice and thoughtfully restrained musicianship. Mindy's pure and gentle voice could easily be overwhelmed by the back-up, but this album has great players and superb mixing to create an elegant harmony of voice and instrument.""Hurricane"" is another gentle gem; again, Mindy's sweet vocal blends with the instruments in a magical way. Few CD's seem to be worth the purchase price any more; I'm happy to report that this one is well worth it."
4,very fresh voice and method,"Whether singing the intriquing lyrics to ""Come to Jesus"" or revisiting Dolly Parton's ""Jolene"" Mindy's voice and presentation has an almost haunting, emotional quality that somehow remains with you long after the song has ended.This is a gifted lady."
3,PRETTY SONGS -- PRETTY EMPTY,"I purchased this based upon hearing ""Come to Jesus"" on the radio. Too bad the rest of the CD doesn't live up to the emotion and integrity of that song. The rest of the CD is filled with pretty songs sung in a pretty voice, but nothing that compels me to continue listening to the whole CD. Give me Patty Griffin any day."
3,Pleasant but average,"Come To Jesus, Train Song and It's Amazing are pretty good songs, but the rest of this release sounds like open mike night at the coffee house. Not sure what all the fuss is about. Smith is okay, but not all that.The lyrics are okay but the music is kind of lukewarm folk."
3,Eh....Not Awful,"This book was kind of silly to me. Personally, I find when I try to read erotica that's not from Ellora's Cave it's just not the same! I'm not sure what made it silly to me, I've read books with aliens and shape shifters so I'm OK with the fantasy aspect. But it's definately not a keeper. I'll be donating it to my local library!"
3,Good sex little plot,"Overall better than average for the genre, but with limited humor and no reeal plot I can't give it a higher rating inspite of thw well written errotic scenes."
3,Apartment hunting with Dawn Cookson in Florence,"Dawn Cookson recounts interesting experiences about her life in Florence, whilst studying with Annigonni. The book has several fine reproductions and is well written. Unfortunately the author spends more time recounting ""her"" experiences and diffuculty finding apartments in Florence than she does talking about Annigoni. I would still highly recommend this book to any one interested in Pietro Annigoni. Just don't expect to learn anything about how the artist painted (other than a recipe for egg tempera paints) ."
1,crappiest oven ever,"This is one of the worst pieces of crap I have ever bought. It has, with in the last two years, caused fires which almost totally burned down my kitchen. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy."
3,Oster 6290 Toaster Oven,Somewhat dissapointed. Use is mostly for toast. Hard to judge as to where to set timer for optimum toasting. Wish now that I had kept my Black & Decker Toaster.
3,great saw but false advertising.,"Upon inspection of the product description I noticed that they described the product in the first title as being a RIP saw. Later in product description it is categorized as a CROSS CUT saw. This is a big difference and since I was looking to buy a RIP saw I was very disappointing. I tried contacting the seller and have not received any call backs or e-mails.However, upon further research I have learned that there is a difference between different styles of RIP saws. the GERMAN RIP saw does not have a clean 90 degree tooth placement against the blade of the saw, the teeth are angled slight 10 degrees and alternate. the ENGLISH RIP saw has teeth that are perpendicularity to the blade, making them look more like the rip blades on a circular saw.Even if this saw I purchased was German rip (which it is not) that still does not justify the confusing advertisement and description. I am looking to return the saw and purchase from another company."
2,This is not a RIP saw.,"The teeth are filed for cross cut, not for rip cut. It cuts much slower than my Stanley panel saw in both cross and rip cuts."
2,Stick to Crayola,This is the 3rd kind of color tablet I've tried and I'd never get them again. The Crayola tub tints and the Sesame Street dots are both FAR better (though also more expensive). These are SO tiny and hardly make any color at all. We can put 10 in the tub and it's still only VERY lightly tinted!
2,not the best,"I love color tints for the bathtub, but not these. The containers are very small and it takes many many of the pellets to really turn the water a color. So we went through them very fast. Not really worth the money."
1,Save your money,"I bought this very expensive cream at the recommendation of a certified aesthetician who raved about it and showed me several studies (by Neova, I believe) claiming that copper improves skin dramatically, etc. This stuff was worthless! It didn't moisturize as well as my regular cheap cream and really didn't do anything positive for my skin. (I gave it plenty of opportunity). I returned it, and they took it back willingly because so many clients were complaining about it. Save your money and try something else."
2,Does Not Moisturize - Very Dissappointing!,"This must be good for your skin, but it did not help my dehydrated skin. I would put a lot of it on morning & night, but even after using the whole jar, it did not make my face moisturized. When I would just rinse my face w/ warm water at the end of the day, it would be just like I never had any moisturizer on it. I would recommend spending your dollars on a differant product."
2,The Kingfisher Film,"Strong acting from both main characters, particularly from Rex Harrison - but the narrative and purpose of the film never really excite the viewer. It seems to ramble along with characters coming in and exiting as needed. Interesting and not disturbing but not a film you'd rave about to friends saying that they must see it. If you're into old films with predictable lines and action capitalising on the skills of well-known actors, then see it - but you probably won't watch it more than on two wet non-consecutive evenings spread some time apart."
3,Mixed review,"Give three great actors a weak script and you have a weak production with outstanding performances. This television film was supposed to be something very witty and sophisticated, something like Oscar Wilde would have written. It isn't. It's quite dull, in fact, and appears to have as its point the fashionable cliche that homosexual love is as important as heterosexual love. Or something like that. Hiller, Harrison, and Cusak (especially the latter) are predictably marvelous, but you could almost see the script they're going through. On the whole, it's a waste of great talent."
3,Fuzzy Translation for Logic Beginners,"I found this text to be a satisfactory introduction to the principles of Fuzzy Logic. I don't think that the book presents the relevant information to developing a fuzzy system, but rather tries to excite the viewer with useless examples of fuzzy systems.It did answer and explain in detail fuzzy logic and the history behind the controversial mathematical concept. To predict the characteristic of something based on a table of measured values is something whose problem lies in the implementation of such a process. It would take a good amount of testing to find how much torque is needed to counteract the steering in commuter trains. The previous sentence was one of the examples used in the text."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I had hoped to get a concise introduction to fuzzy logic from this book. But the author only discusses fuzzy logic at the highest level, not much more deeply than most newspaper and magazine articles. The original text was clearly written in Japanese, and the translation is among the worst I've dealt with in the science and mathematical subjects.In short, apply the money you would spend for this book to one that is more expensive but actually useful. Just accept that getting to know fuzzy will not be cheap!"
3,Rudimentary exposure.,"Yes,this is a terrible translation, probably the worst that I have ever encountered. There is literally an error on nearly every page.However, as a beginner tool there is merit to this book. It is more like an extended magazine article or something that you might find in a junior high or high school library. If you want to read this to familiarize yourself with fuzzy concepts or as a tool with which to base a decision on further study, then this might suit your needs. The information itself is accurate and gives basic background on fuzzy logic."
1,huge disapointment,"I am an engineer and have read a lot of books on science, math andof course engineering. But I have never read a book this bad inEnglish. Apparently, translator's mother tongue is not English.I am inclined to blame the publisher who publishes a book withoutchecking the credential of the translator. My recommendation is:do not waist your money on this book."
3,"Its for beginners, it says so in the title.","While I would agree that the text of the book is a poor translation from the original Japanese (my guess is they waved it in the general direction of an editor while he was distracted) and there is not much in the way of technical depth to the book, it seems to me to very nicely and concisely capture the spirit of the ""Fuzzy"" movement.All in all I think its a great introduction if you are wondering what all this fuzzy nonsense is about anyway, but don't plan on reading it twice."
4,A LONG WAIT ........,"I have been waiting 30 years for this story to be told - now that I have read it, there are some things that probably should have remained in the dark, if only for memories sake! The author did a superior job of researching his information and presenting it in an unbiased fashion- weighing in when he felt it necessary to lodge his own conclusions. As a long time student of this period in Hollywood with a large library of books to support it, I haved learned many of these ""secrets"" in my travels through the non-fiction world that has been available through the years but I must admit that there were some unpleasant surprizes in this book that had only been hinted at in others and many times, incorrectly. If the movie ""Hollywoodland"" had not traversed the George Reeves murder so thoroughly, this telliing would have mined a lot of clues by itself. In ""The Fixers"", many a rumor has now been put to rest."
3,Superficial Look at Mannix and Strickling,"I had high hopes for this book but found it disappointing for the amount of questionable and unsourced allegations. Just because a story has told before in print doesn't make it true. I was looking for a source to support my own research and so I already knew some history around MGM in general and Mannix and Strickling in particular, so I spotted errors in The Fixers right away. As a result I have shied away from using this as a source. For an overview of MGM and its way of doing business, this is fine. Just don't expect every word inside the covers to be true."
5,GREAT book,Well written with just enough dirt to make it readable but not salacious.A glimpse into a far away time when movies were king and the studios ruled.
3,Interesting but Not Thoroughly Accurate,"The book is essentially interesting, and contains stories that I have not read elsewhere. However, one could also question the validity of these narratives since certain details appear to be inaccurate at best. For instance, Lana Turner was an only child and did not arrive in Hollywood with her mother and sisters. The name of her second husband was Stephan Crane and not John Crane. Audrey Meadows, from the Honeymooners, died in 1996 and not 2002. Moreover, although the author notes that Laurence Olivier's first marriage was unconsummated, the actor's first-born son, Tarquin, resulted from that union."
2,Disappointing,"As one reviewer has stated, there is very little here which can not be sourced in others books. I suppose the value is that it has all come together in one read.The list of scandals is built around the careers of Mannix and Strickling at MGM. The book is structured so you get the feeling of each scandal as it occurs. As Mannix and Strickling are dealing with one issue, another arises, then another etc. They were very busy.I too skimmed the last sections. The detailed analysis of George Reeves, the first superman, is boring.I have passed the book on. Borrow it from your library but don't waste your money like I did."
2,Mistake after mistake,"It's hard to trust Fleming's ""new"" information about the situations Mannix and Strickling ""fixed"" when he can't handle basic facts such as the location of Hearst's Wyntoon property (Northern California, not Oregon as Fleming says) or which trains brought the early film pioneers to Los Angeles (not the 20th Century Ltd., as he says since it only ran between NYC and Chicago). Some of his gossipy details have been supported by the stars themselves or by people close to them, but far too many are just rank speculation he presents as fact. If I'd paid the very high cost for this book, I'd be irate. God bless Interlibrary Loan. Save your own money, readers."
2,fascinating but factually suspect,"Potentially fascinating stuff about the MGM guys who covered up Hollywood scandals but too much hearsay and out-and-out misinformation to be taken seriously. Author claims Rex Harrison's US career was ""doomed"" by his affiliation with the 1948 suicide of actress Carole Landis. Actually, Rex' best career years were yet to come--Broadway stardom in My Fair Lady (and Best Actor Oscar for subsequent film version), Oscar nomination for Cleopatra, a co-starring role opposite Doris Day at height of her popularity, lead in multi-million dollar musical Dr Dolittle. . .so much for career disaster. And fact-checking. Fix this!"
1,Horrible book,This book is so riddled with lies and contradictions it is useless as Hollywood history. I have never read a worse book on Hollywood period. I wish I could get a refund of the purchase price. Don't waste your money on this one. I have personally been to all the Thelma Todd locales and the authors account is pure fabrication. I could note many more inconsistencies.
1,too expensive,you can purchase this for $5 normally. check around. dont buy it here get it on steam. this is trying to get people to pay over 100 is stupid and should be removed
5,A classic Jam/Lewis production.,"This album takes a brotha' back into a really fun time of the 80's when the sound of music bands were still booming. The SOS Band were one of those rare funk bands of that time period who kept a good sound going with the help of Terry Lewis and Jimmy Jam. ""Do You Still Care"" is definitely one of my favorite slow tunes of all time. That song still sounds just as good today as it did some 20 plus years ago. That song still stands out even here in 2010. It would be nice if some record label can start releasing all of this group's self titled albums on cd, especially this title and ""Just The Way You Like It"". Another classic SOS album."
5,relaxation,"I have MAJOR trouble relaxing.It normally takes something like a 90 minute massage, a very long walk, or an hour soak in a hot tub.Before I found this CD, I did not know of ANYTHING that could instantly relax me. Yet, with this CD all I need is 10-15 minutes, and I am back to a happy, relaxed person. This CD, Celtic Twilight 3: Lullabies, is an absolute must for me (as well as the cd by an artist named Meav). It has helped me refocus and return to tranquility after a stressful day at work. It's so important, I have 2 copies of it. ( Just incase I break or loose it.)Now, as if being good for me wasn't enough, my two extremely active kids love it. This CD instantly puts my 10 year old daughter and 2 year old son asleep for a nap or in the evening. Both even ask for it if they need a ""little time-out alone"".All around it's a WONDERFUL CD!!"
2,Lullabies???,"Celtic Twilight... maybe. Celtic Night-Night... no way!!!I bought this cd because of all of the wonderful reviews, but was sorely disappointed when I played the album! We got this for my 9 month old daughter in hopes that it would soothe her at nap time, but the music is so lively that it keeps her awake. The words are lullaby words, abut the music is a bit too spunky for nap or bedtime."
3,great start though falls apart,What you can't see from the pic is that this is a group of circles pressed into each other. (An extremely hard force at the center of the target would knock out the solid circle center). It is not one solid target.It worked great for throwing knives at. Maybe if I had nailed it against a wall instead of hanging it by a chain against the wall it would have lasted a lot longer. (there would be no play for the sections to move)That being said. What other options do you have but to make your own from a solid piece of wood? I've had my target for 2 weeks and now it's destroyed.Here I come Lowes.or maybe i could just get a dart board and take off the metal from the face.... ?
4,Wish it was a little bigger (yeah that's what she says),Kinda figured it being a little bigger oh well guess I'll just have to get better with my knives and quills. Put a larger backstop behind it for those longer less accurate throws. Nice target for the money though. If your into throwing knives and such you won't be disappointed with the quality either I've hit mine hundreds of times(won't say how many times I've thrown and missed though) and it still looks like new except some of the yellow is getting dirty. Not bad!
4,Target Board,Did not realize that this Throwing Knives Target Board was 1/2 inch thick. Would be nice to see a picture of it sitting next to a ruler to show the size and width.
1,Not very Durable,"I got this board as a Christmas Present prom my aunt, and in no time had a nail in a tree and was throwing realivly small six inch knives at it often.The metal rim on the edge is really flimly, and in fact was getting steadily chewed up by the occasional misthrow.i left it out for one night in a rainstorm by accident and the entire metal rim was obliberated and torn off, destroying the rest of the target as well.This is a great board if you have good aim and not pressed for money, but really this is not worth what its price is. Something that gets destroyed this easily is not really worth it"
1,"Sad, Sad, Sad....masquerading as a target board","This board was a joke. Joel and I used it once, and it fell apart. The whole middle fell out. We discovered it was just a thin line of some type of paper that was rolled and rolled ..until it became large enough to masquerade as a target board. Used once and in the garbage. Poor, poor, poor...I can't say it enough times! I was disappointed in Amazon for even selling it."
1,These targets not meant for knives despite the title.,"This is essentially a dart board, darts are not knives there enlies the problem. Boards like this one are made of paper rolled up very tightly and held together by a few small screws around the outside. If you are using this for cheap and or small shurikens, small and I mean SMALL (no more than 2-3 in in length) throwing knives then it will probably be ok. If you want to use this for anything else then skip this. You would be better off taking some woodglue and glueing a bunch of old cardboard boxed together and using that. Better yet just build a target board by nailing some 2x4s together. I have seen a few of these come up here and there and seriously trust me these are the worst possible targets you can use for weapons throwing."
1,quality is worthless,I purchased two of the target boards and before I started using them I duct taped the entire backside of the target. I read reviews on the product and most of them said that they would fall apart after throwing knives at them. So I decided to reinforce the target. Guess what it didnt work it started falling apart on the first day and the second day i figured out that it looks like compressed paper.............WHAT EVER YOU DO ...DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE...............
2,Not very well crafted.,"This target board, while aptly fulfilling its duty as a target board, fails with regards to its craftsmanship. It is made from concentric rings, which unfortunately, are not glued or even stapled together. The result is that when you throw a knife into it, then try to pull the knife from the board, the ring comes with the knife. Although this can be remedied by by holding it down, the fact is, for a small board that costs around $20, you would think they would have at the very least glued the rings together. So, two stars."
1,Cheap Construction,"I purchased this item awhile ago and only got a few uses out it. The board is poorly constructed and loosely bound. I made the mistake of not securely mounting it to the wall. Once it fell, it was pretty much done. The metal ring around the board that binds the board together was not sufficiently tightened. The board basicaly unraveled and shortly found it's way to my trash. Look elsewhere if you intend to use this for any length of time."
3,Board is decent,"Throwing stars quickly did damage to the board, especially the metal band around the outside. I think it will hold up for awhile and we'll have to get another one to replace it."
1,Fell apart right out of the box,"when i received the target board, upon opening the package I noticed that the board had only one visual side. The middle of the board where there is a red dot, it fell out and the entire board unraveled into a huge pile of tangled, curled card board. I would not recommend this product to be bought and used for the advertised intended use."
3,A Bit Flimsy,"Yup, where it could also be larger, it is no much thicker than 3/4"". We are going to attach some kind of backer to it- maybe some plywood- to keep it from falling apart. You may be better off with just a plain old dartboard. The photos imply that it is two sided but the one I received only had the single ""Dragon Center"" design. We will see how it holds up!"
3,Its a dart board,what can i say besides its a dart board? Works just like i was expecting double sided was a nice feature though. its not a single piece its about 4 or 5 compressed into one if its hit hard the red middle will fall out
5,Very informative!,"Many thanks to Mike Gray and Maia Szlavitz for the AlterNet article (included on page 85) on Straight, Incorporated and similarly abusive gulags run by the John Birchers of the drug treatment industry. Thank GOD they're beginning to lose credibility and market share. I'm sure it's due, in part, to investigative reporting over the years by authors and reporters like you. I'll sleep just a little better because a few more poeple are wise to this scam. Again, thanks!"
3,Maybe.,"I'm about halfway finished reading Charles Bowden's ""TEACHINGS OF DON FERNANDO: A Life and Death in the Narcotics Trade."" Bowden is identified as a contributing editor of Harper's Magazine, where the article appeared in June 2002.The title, alluding to Castenada's Teachings of Don Juan, hints at a spoof. Maybe every word of this tale is true, but Bowden's extravagantly heightened style casts suspicion. Hollywood might buy it, though."
3,A big yawn,"Nothing to see here...move along.Kapferer promises ""new approaches"" and delivers the same tired pablum. Not worth the time it takes to read it--you won't find anything applicable in the book."
5,Most challenging Pilates tape!!,"I have over 10 pilates tapes and this, by far, is the most challenging. It is an excellent work out. The tape is rather long, but you can start at the ""hundred"" as most other pilates tapes do. The instructor is excellent and keeps the class going at an excellent pace. I would highly recommend this tape."
5,The Best Book I've Read In A Long Time!,My teacher just recommended this book to me. I am so glad that she did also. I have really enjoyed this book a lot and I am looking foward to buying it! This is the best book I have read in a long time! This is a great book to read if you like contemporary books.
1,The Living Dead Collection,I have recently purchased this collection and all three DVD's have a format error causing them to skip and stutter. Buyer beware!
4,I get it now......,"At first i was kinda confused, cause in this album they have songs in english, but i get it now,this disc is a tribute to some songs of diferent groups whom sings in english and Spanish, soo, i recomend this album only for its spanish talked songs, english one's suck's, anyway there's only 2 english songs, so it really doesn't matter."
4,"Death Comes to Eveyone, But I Didn't Expect This","Truly, this is a great book. However, as you may have guessed, CERASI DIES. WHY HER? That stupid fool Nield should've died!!!!! I always ask myself: ""Why do my favourite characters have to die!?"". Maybe it's God's way of toying with me, I dunno. You've probably guessed why I've only rated this book 4 out of 5 by now. Anyways, I guess I really just want to say: ""MAY CERASI'S SOUL BE ONE WITH THE FORCE!!!!"""
4,Nice Ending (not),"Why does Jude Watson ALWAYS do this? Maybe he/she loves torturing readers. There were thing in this book I liked and didn't like. I liked how Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon talked about becoming Master and Apprentice again, and how we hear of Bant again, and how Bruck is a bad guy. (never liked him) I didn't like how Jude Watson made it seem that the betrayal was Qui-Gon's fault. That bugged me. It made the adults look dumber than the kids. I hate that. All and all it was a fun book. When's #7 coming out anyways?"
5,This book will put you in AMAZMENT,"This book was GRATE everthing that I look in for a book was in Jedi Apprentice #6 as was there as in every Jedi Apprentice so far, it made me laugh, cry, and in some parts it made cry out NO! YES! and NO THAT CAN'T HAPPEN! But the path of Obi-Wans and Qui-Gons relationahip right now is very fragile. Which is exciting to think that it can only grow stronger. This book is a must read. cant put down book and I recamend it to anyone,and everyone."
5,Wow!,"This book was awesome. The whole series is great and I can't wait for the next installment. I read this on the way home from school and I realized that this is one book that can really touch you. The realationships between the characters are so complex that you can almost think of the next move they will make. In my opinion Tahl is really cool, Cerasi almost had me in tears, Roenni showed real friendship, Qui-Gon realized that Obi-Wan is just a kid and that you can't give up on kids, Neild learned that you can't trust everybody and Obi-Wan realized what he was... This book has only one fault... it's too short. (And please don't let the age range keep you from buying this book- I'm over the ""limit"" and I love these books.)"
5,I Can't Wait!!!,"Another nail biting, tear jerking installment in the Jedi Apprentice series. And Jude Watson isn't letting up. The end leaves you craving the next chapter as much as the end of 5. Obi-Wan is my favorite Star Wars character and I've found there's far too little written about him. This series wets my appetite. I would love to see an adult series written around Obi-Wan. Perhaps the new series beginning in May 2000 will be the answer. Till then I await No 7 eagerly."
5,What a great Read!,"I'll admit it straight off, I am not exactly a young reader. Let's say I'm young at heart. I adore this whole series. This one had me in tears at times. The author has captured the characters so beautifully. And even although we do know that they become Master and pupil, it's hard not to worry right now. I think this relationship building is great and gives you real insight into both characters. I also enjoyed the other characters in this book. Cerasi was a very special character, as was her Father. I also like the fact, that although the books are written for a younger audience, they don't exclude us oldies. I can't wait for the next one."
5,The Best!,I loved this book. I've read every single JA book up to number 12. This is one of my most favorite!! It shows hhow even as a Jedi Obi-Wan still makes the mistake that normal kids his age would. Jump into a decision rashly without thinking of the consequences. It also tells how even though he left the order and qui-gon he still relies on the jesi's words of wisdom. It also told of his bond to Cerasi and Neild.
5,Depressing...,"Ugh. This is one of those books that takes you to the highest high and the lowest low. I hate to use the cliché, but you'll feel like you're being dragged along behind the last car in a violent roller-coaster, hitting each bar of the track as you go. You think everything will resolve, and then BOOM! Another tragedy hits like a new single from the Backstreet Boys. Which reminds me, I have to send a formal request to the Jedi Temple to have a few, um, problems eliminated..."
5,This series is heating up,"This is easily the best of the Jedi Apprentice books yet. It deals with both Obi-Wan's and Qui-Gon's emotions, pains, and fears, and it does it fairly well. There are two different plot-lines, so the series is also beginning to fit together as well. It concludes the story from the previous book and leads into the next one quite nicely.The only problem is that Qui-Gon's emotions just seem kind of cut-and-pasted from the first book.Other than that, I definitely recommend this one."
4,A Jedi Craves not These Things...,"I am liking this series. I read the first 5 books last year, and started again just this week. I am a nut when it comes to reading a series in order, so I wanted to start with these books to see how Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon interact together before venturing into the prequels and follow-up novels to the movies.This series is set towards young readers, but I find the story on an adult level. A good and easy read for someone wanting a short story."
5,Just As Great As All the Others!,"This book is just as good as all the other books in the series. Obi-Wan decides to stay on the planet Melida/Daan with his new friends, while Qui-Gon, his Master goes back to Coruscant. This book is absolutely great, just like all the other Jedi Apprentice books. Jude Watson is a wonderful writer! I like to read about Obi-Wan Kenobi (mainly because he's Ewan McGregor). Obi-Wan's adventures with his Master are very exciting, so don't waste time! Order the book!"
5,Jude Does It Agin!!!!,"I just finished this book and it was great! I was highly filled with emotion threw this hole book. I would have to say this book does not at all take long to read (I finished in 2 days)but it is packed with adventure,action,and many emotionel moments. This book has been one of the best in this JA series yet! What is interesting about this book is that it switches from Qui-Gon and his duties, and to Obi-Wan and his in about the first 12 chapters. I'm not saying this is bad or anything but it made me feel like I was interested in the book all the time. This is because sometimes the plot can get kind of boring (in any story and this system keeps you inmterested all of the time. This was a great book and any Star Wars fan thats out there like me will love this #6 JA book!!"
5,Who could put this book down?!,"I love this book! The crisis on Melida/Daan that sweeps young Obi-Wan into uncertainty and the mystery of the intruder at the Jedi temple had me on the edge of my seat. If books could get someone high, these could do it! A death of an old friend (Obi-Wan's ""girlfriend"") had me near tears. And the rejection that Obi-Wan was given from the Jedi made me upset, but he had disobeyed his master. The silence between Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan made me shudder, but I expect all hard feelings will end in book #7. I have read tons of Jude Watson! She (or he?)is a great writer! I can't wait to read #7!"
3,The worst of the series,"I love the Jedi Apprentace series, but this one I was dissapointed with. The setting was in the dark horror trenches of war. Inocent people get killed, and it really leaves you hanging at the end. I would not recomend this perticular book of the series to a young child. Anyone who thinks Obi-Wan Kenobi is rad will deffinetly hate this book. It potrays Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon as they turned into brutes."
3,A Let-down from Defenders of the Dead,"Overall, I've greatly enjoyed the Jedi Apprentice series. It's not Harry Potter, but it gets the job done. Defenders of the Dead was a highlight, with an ending that left this jaded, cynical adult gasping with shock.Unfortunately, The Uncertain Path leads to too much boredom. Obi-Wan mopes and Qui-Gon sulks, while the Youth on Melida/Daan regress into the children that they are. A few things salvage the book. Yoda giving Qui-Gon a chewing out (sorry, ""Yoda a chewing out giving Qui-Gon, hmmmm?""), a touching scene with Cerasi's father, and the lack of quick resolution to the Obi-Wan/Qui-Gon conflict. Hope remains high for book 7."
4,Not Bad,"I thought this was a pretty good book, but definately not what I was looking forward to seeing. I was very disappointed that Cerasi was killed off, but I guess it did add something to the story. I was hoping that Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan's reunion would have been a little more dramatic. Over all it was a good book though and I can't wait for the next one."
2,"Good as an introduction, but little else","I think the title sums it up nicely. They don't do enough of their older work, especially all the nice cuts off ""Official Version"" and ""No Comment."" My biggest gripe is that it just feels like a re-hashed version of Re:Boot, with some added material from Pulse but the sound quality is utter crap, comparatively. The elaborate visuals were half the reason to go, but their immanence is lost on the DVD recording. Overall, this is a disappointing release from an amazing band."
1,DANGER!! DANGER!!! BLEW UP MY CAMCORDER!,"This replacement battery fried our camcorder 2 weeks before christmas. Our old battery was not holding a charge, but there was no problem with the camcorder. After following the instructions (charge first), we inserted the battery and it totally locked up....even when plugged into the wall, it would not operate. It took all day to get the current tape out and we can no longer operate the camcorder. Don't go for the bargain when it comes to this! DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE! When contacted the supplier, they refunded us the cost of the battery, BUT NOT THE CAMCORDER IT FRIED!"
1,Really Bad Band,This band is really bad. All of my friends that like them seem to need to smoke tons of weed and do e to enjoy these guys. The only thing worse than this album is hearing them live.
1,Worst band ever,"This band sucks- it all sounds the same. This one is for those guys who wear grateful dead shirts and vote republican. I actually have seen these guys live and they suck. Basically just a bar band for ""Beer Hippies"". This album is the same as the others."
1,Not Good at All.,"I just can't get in to this. The music bores me and the song writing is weak. Basically this band is ""phish for dummies."" Those people who just couldn't get the humor of Phish all seemed to turn to these guys."
1,Way too expensive,"I am a subscriber to the WSJ print edition. The Kindle edition costs $179.40 per year while the online WSJ is only $104. The online version provides the subscriber significantly more information and includes pictures, charts and videos. It also contains most of the articles contained in the print edition. Since the Kindle edition is so limited - no graphs or pictures- compared with either the print edition and the online edition, I would not recommend it. One is far better off with the online version."
2,No Longer at this Price!,"At $10/month the Kindle edition was convenient, portable, and pretty readable.At $15/month - you've lost me as a subscriber!"
3,Price doesn't make sense,"First of all, having the WSJ delivered when I am at home or on the road is a great feature. I like the Kindle Edition enough to want to keep it.However, I have to agree with others here that say the pricing makes absolutely no sense:$99/year for the WSJ print edition with the Online Web edition included.$119.88/year ($9.99/month) for the Kindle edition just doesn't make sense. Especially since the Kindle edition has fewer features, and almost none of the Pictures.So apparently the extra $20/year is for Whispernet delivery. That makes no sense because I could buy the Web edition and read it through the Kindle Browser for no additional charge.Amazon, the pricing on this makes no sense. Either get the WSJ people to include the Web edition in the price tag, or lower the price $30 or so per year. Less content for a greater price is simply not a good deal."
1,Price increase kills it!,"It was really nice to have the WSJ delivered electronically to my Kindle, but the recent price increase to $14.99 a month really kills the concept.The original price was $9.99 per month, or $120 per year...a slight premium to the $103 you would pay for the online version. It was worth it at that price for the convenience of having it on the Kindle. With the recent price increase of 50% to $14.99 per month, or $180 per year, it really is not worth it. I also can't imagine what their justification is for charging a 75% premium for the Kindle version. Finally, it seems rather predatory of them to initially price it at $9.99 and then increase it to $14.99 after getting a bunch of people to spend the money for the device...we are now a captive audience and it seems they are going to extract whatever they can from us. Don't buy it."
1,$14.99? Consider WSJ Cancelled!,I thought long and hard about the WSJ before ordering.. What we are getting barely justifies the $9.99 price. Now they want $14.99.. I am done. CANCELED!
1,Price increase incredibly disappointing,"The availability of the WSJ was the original impetus that pushed me to purchase a Kindle 2. Although it was slightly more expensive than I was currently paying for a subscription, the appeal of not having papers pile up on the driveway while I was traveling and having constant access seemed worth the extra price. Now the 50% increase in price has me feeling taken advantage of and wishing I had never even purchased my Kindle. What's next - NYT best sellers at $29.99? Very disappointing move, Amazon."
1,"Great convenince, but not worth $15 when print plus online is cheaper","I have enjoyed the convenience of whispernet delivery, but a 50% increase for an unimproved product is absurd. I can get a mail subscription PLUS online access cheaper. The whispernet delivery does not justify paying a higher price for an inferior version of the product."
3,Real reason for price increase,"Much of a newspaper's revenue comes from advertising, not subscriptions. The Kindle edition has no advertising. Thus you pay more for the convenience of not having to skip 1 for every 5 Kindle pages of ads. However, the WSJ needs to improve its Kindle product with full delivery of the good or at least an option to view online. Newspapers aren't making any money off Kindle editions yet, so it's all still pretty experimental, just like the failure of iPhones or iPods in early editions. Wait for them to get the product ""glitch"" free and buy."
2,I was subscribed for $9.99 a month...now - no more,"It was nice reading the WSJ on my kindle every morning, even though I usually do not pay for news. Commentary, yes, I am paying for that - but the WSJ does not really have the edge there. The after about two months of subscriptions my monthly rate went up 50% ??? Geez for a business publication - they for sure do not understand a lot about business."
1,"Was, but now I'm definitely NOT going to subscribe","I was giving serious consideration to subscribing to the WSJ with my new Kindle 2. We get a paper edition at work every day but I thought it would be handy to be able to read it on the train using my Kindle. Since they went up to $15, I'm going to stay with my freebie at work. Thanks WSJ for helping me make the decision!"
1,mediocre on kindle,"It is much better on the Kindle Fire than on the regular Kindle. I am glad I traded up, because the Fire version lets you use your online wsj subscription"
1,Very Disappointing !,"I knew this Kindle edition of the WSJ would not include stock quotes, but after reading an issue TWICE it was upsetting to realize I ould not even find the end of day number for the DOW or NASDAQ. This is supposed to be a Financial newspaper. I next bought an issue of the New York Times and found thoe numbers in 10 seconds!"
4,Better than web site reading,"I like WSJ as an overall news source. I like this form of media as I can take it anywhere throughout the day and pick up a read. Nice to have the new edition transferred in the morning. True, the web site has lots of visuals which can be valuable for many, but I just want to read the latest without any annoying advertisements. I complained to WSJ about the website animation ads many times. I really-really hope they don't transfer this to the future kindle editions. Then I'll cancel my subscription.In summary, I didn't think I'd like it, but I reading more of the news than before; and enjoying the experience. :-)"
1,Sad,I already have an online subscription but apparently that wont get me access on my Kindle. Ridiculous.
1,WSJ has abandoned me.,"when i had a kindle i subscribed to WSJ but now that i have a FIRE, WSJ has abandoned me."
1,"Less info, more cost","My WSJ online is under $100, which includes everything, pictures and all (not to mention, as rumor has it, Rupert may make it free soon, anyway). Why is this one $120?"
1,Pricing too high and responses from Amazon is worthless,"I got an email from the WSJ offering the online content at $1.99 a week or $8.62 per month. I called to get that same price delivered to my Kindle and the WSJ people said that Amazon has to adjust the price. I called Amazon and they said the WSJ has to adjust the price. It is absurd to me that the same product has different price points, particularly given that the WSJ on the Kindle doesn't provide the Business & Finance short commentary in the first couple of articles every day. I've been satisfied with my Kindle, but it is poor business practice to have discrepancies in price that are as vast as what Amazon and the WSJ Online are offering.Amazon has a real issue with this and it needs to be fixed."
1,Wsj must look into kindle business,"It does not make any sense. I already have full subscription with wsj which covers online, print, and tablets version. Now i have to pay another $21 a month to get it on kindle paperwhite? It is insane. I have called to Amazon and file a complaint about it and they have told me they would submit it to executive team. They have also mentioned that nobody has contacted them with the similar issue. Maybe executive team from Amazon should spend more time to read comments from unhappy customers. I think we all should call and ask them why we should pay twice for exact the same subscription?"
1,WSJ is awesome price is not,"i loved the news i was getting everyday but the price is up to $21.99 a month.Its just too much, i cant get news anywhere and would love WSJ if it was $9 a month like it used to be."
2,"Easy to subscribe, but not so easy to cancel... BEWARE","It was very easy to sign up for this subscription. I liked the format and the navigation thru the paper. However, when I started to fall behind daily reading and decided that I just wasn't reading the Journal often enough, I decided to cancel my subscription. I've tried doing this twice via the Amazon site and I still get charged monthly and the editions keep downloading to my Kindle. It just won't stop.So, if you think that you can try this (or probably any other subscription) for a month or so and then stop if you don't like or need it any longer... think again. Feels like Hotel California."
1,Not fair,"I have a subscription for the wall street journal print and digital. I can access the wall street journal on any computer, my android phone. However, it will not work on the kindle and amazon demands a separate subscription. This is just not right."
1,To much money for Digital,"I was a big fan, but it is not worth the price for DIGITAL. Also, you didn't get access to the 'on-line' version which is a waste. The price makes it a NO. I am actually bummed because I did enjoy it."
1,Yuk,"I was excited to get the Fire and immediately set up the WSJ. The content, pictures, and layout is great BUT you move the Kindle at all slightly it locks up. You try to load the paper in the morning and 50% of the time it locks up and you need to re-boot the Fire. If I can get through one article it is a miracle. I cannot believe this is actually a supported product from Amazon."
2,Too Expensive,"This is definitely the best newspaper in the U.S., but the price for the Kindle edition is way too much. I don't understand why they charge more for the Kindle version than the print version. Obviously they save money not having to print... It doesn't make sense. $99-119 a year would be the sweet-spot for this. Furthermore, they should have a national version which should be even cheaper. I'm not interested in NYC events when I'm in Miami, I doubt many are. WSJ, bring down the price and you would get 5 star reviews for this service."
2,Dissapointing,Liked the ease in moving from topic to topic. But hard to find specific columnists. Would like to see names of writers which would help locate favorites. Ability to access outside country is awesome.
1,Horrible format. Will stick to paper,Was looking for a news/business e-mag to replace The Daily. Just glad I didn't buy a full subscription. Will keep reading the WSJ. Just going to wait until they hire someone to fix the digital version before I consider this again. Horrible.
2,The Wall Street Journal Kindle Edition,Using the Kindle to read a newspaper was just too difficult. Books are much easier as they flow page after page without a lot of searching.
1,No local news included,"I have subscribed to the WSJ print edition for years. I made the switch over to the Kindle edition and found that the few pages of local news was omitted. Also, I agree with other reviewers that the price is too high."
1,WalllStreet Journal (Kindle Edition) in Canada ?,Can someone tell me why I can't get the Wall Street Journal (Kindle Edition) in Canada ?I really don't want to receive the paper edition. The Kindle edition is not available from anyone else.Thanks !
1,Home/online delivery of WSJ is MUCH cheaper!,"I had recently received a Kindle as a gift and I was really excited about reading the WSJ on it. That is, until I saw the price. $15 a month - are you guys nuts??!! I just checked and I can get the online version of WSJ for $8/month. I can get the printed version delivered to my door every morning for just $9.16/month. I can get both the online and print version for just $10.76/month.No thanks, Amazon. You blew it!"
1,Kindle Wall Street Journal Price increase is bad news - signals trouble for Kindle users,"The ""surprise"" 50% price increase will cause me to cancel my subscription.I hope this does not signal a trend that will be applied to other subscriptions as well.Not only is the Kindle WSJ NOT the full WSJ - there is no justification for a price increase of this magnitude where NO value is being added!!This is like credit card devious tactics - I though Amazon/Bezos had more class."
1,Can't buy yesterday's paper -- so annoying,"I get the WSJ print edition at home, but when I travel I buy individual issues of the Kindle edition. But if I forget to buy the ""current issue"" of the Kindle edition each and every day (which can happen when traveling), there seems to be no way to buy yesterday's issue, not on the Kindle, not on the Amazon.com website.So very annoying. Why can't we buy back issues? Does the technology really not exist? Really? And if is somehow avalable on Amazon.com, why is it so hard to find?"
2,Kindle Edition Price Increases,"You have some nerve charging $21.60 for this product. Has anyone at either Amazon or the publisher taken the time to sample how clunky the user-interface is? It does not read at all like the print edition, and should be divided up according to the print edition's individual sections, not by its own subject areas, of which there are far too many. The pricing is especially egregious considering how quickly price increases for this product have come. It was not long ago that it was only 14.99/month for this product. The price then increased to 18.29, and now to over $21/month. Not to mention the WSJ/Nook Edition remains at $18.29. It is a big mistake for Amazon to allow price differentials between e-reader products, especially in light of these prices increases in the first place."
3,Wall Street Journal,"This was ok for .99, but to raise it to 1.99, that's crazy!!!! Inflation around 3% and this product goes up 101%??? It doesn't contain any of the graphs or tables that are in the printed copy. No thanks!!"
1,Not at This Price,"I am a regular subcriber and I was trying to get a Kindle copy while on the road, but at $1.99 a copy they must be crazy. Clearly this ""business paper"" does not get the online business."
1,Price is all wrong,I already pay for print and digital: I can't transfer to Kindle. The increase of 50% from 10 to 15 is too much to handle.
1,At this price - no way!,"I love my Kindle, but asking customers to pay significantly more for a medium that has significantly lower production costs is ridiculous! Even the music industry has finally worked out that a) it should embrace digital media, and b) it should charge less for it. No wonder the printing & publishing industry is in crisis right now. With an industry leader like the WSJ doing this, it's the blind leading the blind.Too bad, if the Kindle subscription was the same price as their online version then I would have subscribed. Now I'm inclined to do neither."
1,Deal Breaker,"Well the thought of drastic price increases and so-so content has convinced me to not buy the WSJ or the Kindle DX. Sorry, but where is the value?"
1,WSJ Print and Online only costs $99.00,"The WSJ offers professionals both the print and online versions of the WSJ together in a bundle for $99.00 per year. Here you can get the Kindle only version of the WSJ for $119.88 per year. In my view this is a bad value. Amazon needs to negotiate better packages with these publishers. I don't want the print version, and would prefer Kindle and Online versions for $99.00. This should be an easy ""yes"" since the WSJ saves printing and delivery costs for the paper copy."
1,Absurdly expensive!!,WSJ on Kindle is super expensive. No economic reason to charge this price. Unreasonable and unwise.
4,"It's good, punctual, and convenient","I like the WSJ in kindle.It's punctual. Everyday the updated newspaper will be sent to me before I get up. It's convenient as well. I can simply grab my kindle with me to school, and read the newspaper on my way.One question I has is that, why there isn't any student discount for WSJ Kindle?"
5,"Pricey, but like having WSJ.com included in new higher price","Signed up for WSJ Kindle at $14.99 and now it's going to $18.29. Pricey, but including the WSJ.com in the new higher price was a smart move. Delivery via 3G is awesome. No ink on hands, no waiting, easy to read travelling, adjustble font on Kindle is nice. Would like better if I could share on my wife's Kindle, after all, we share WSJ.com and hard copy. Stopping the hard copy though, and just going with Kindle and WSJ.com (included)."
1,Price vs Enjoyment.,The price went up and therefore I will not spend the money to enjoy this product. The value simply isn't worth while.
3,User Interface Needs Work,The Kindle version of the WSJ could be made much better with a couple of changes -1. Create a menu of articles within each section (similar to the section list) to improve scanning and selection.2. Add charts and graphs including customizable stock tables as a section.Without these the Kindle version is at best a backup option to the print and mobile versions when they cannot be easily accessed.
2,"Great news, rediculous price","The price disappoints me so much that I really want to give only 1 star, but the content itself deserves some rewarding. I cancelled my subscription solely because of cost. Instead I opted for 3 local papers whose sum equals this one subscription."
2,Love the convenience - but price and usability aren't right,"I love the convenience of receiving the WSJ on my kindle. But I'm not sure that I'll keep it at this price. Also, initially, I thought that there was a significant problem with how articles are browsed. My impression was that, in order to browse article, you needed to page through them in stepwise fashion (within each section), i.e. that there was no menu of articles. I missed the fact that you may access a menu of article by clicking on the numbers that appear to the right of each section title. This is a usability problem. I'm a fairly savvy user of technology - and I missed this. A lower price -- and slight refinement of usability would convert me to a long-term subscriber"
3,high priced,"Although WSJ has good reporting and covers all the news, the price keeps going up. I often buy alternatives due to the inflated price. I don't think the Kindle version of WSJ is that much better than other sources of financial news (Financial Times, for example) to justify the price difference."
2,"New York focus only, no regional content",All copies only include New York feature stories and no Western regional items or features. Disappointing. I buy it only just before boarding a plane when I didn't have time to buy the local print edition and I'm desperate for the front page and international sections.
2,Poor e-paper for folks not living in New York,"Over the past 20 years I've subscribed to a mix of print and online formats. Unfortunately the Kindle version is based on the New York edition. So out of the 100 or so articles in the Kindle edition, at least 30 are New York local articles. At that ratio, it's really hard to justify the cost. All of the local west coast articles are missing. It's a bummer, since I like the paper and I like reading it on the Kindle. I'll either go back to either print or online at this point, or just skip it all together until WSJ can put out a decent localized version for the Kindle."
2,Overpriced,"I didn't mind paying $9.99 for the WSJ on my Kindle. It was a fair price for the convenience and automatic daily delivery. I could read it in the car during traffic stops etc on the morning commute. But suddenly and unexpectedly the price surged a whopping 50% from $9.99 to $14.99. This is just too much to pay for this subscription and I have since cancelled it. To make it worse, it was really the WSJ ""Lite"". There is a great deal of content missing from the daily Kindle version."
3,Frustrating for a Journal fan,"Most of the Journal is here, but not all of it. Important articles are inexplicably left out from time to time. For example, the Kindle version omitted the lead opinion piece on Sotomayor the day after her nomination. And sometimes the hard copy paper carries page one stories that are missing from the Kindle version. These lacunae are puzzling considering that Dow Jones has a luxury of time to distribute the virtual paper -- there is no need to typeset, print, or physically deliver it. I mind the frequent omission of graphics and pictures too, but want of graphics is less bothersome (and easier to forgive) than omission of articles.After two months with the Kindle version I still get the paper version, to which I've subscribed for many years. For the time being I'll keep subscribing to both versions because the Kindle WSJ's convenience is real. Note to Dow Jones: I'd pay hard copy prices for the Kindle version if it were complete."
1,WJ Journal on Kindle,"I was very satisfied with the Journal on the Kindle, although I was unhappy with the New York Area inclusion since I live in Long Beach, CA. However, when I was informed that the price was going up to $15.00 without any rational explanation, I immediately cancelled. I have read the Journal for over twenty years but I believe you can get better information and even better editorial information off the internet for free. I wonder who thought up the price increase and if there are others like me who simply decided to move on with the times."
1,The pricing is greedy,"I canceled my subscription because the ridiculous pricing. It increases again recently. This causes me to change in two ways: (1) Switch from WSJ to FT, which is as good or better and I get cheaply; (2) Stop buying more kindles."
2,"Nice, but too pricey","I tried the WSJ 14-day Kindle edition trial. I enjoy the WSJ's objective, balanced news reporting and while the Kindle edition content is abbreviated compared to the print edition, it provides enough content for me. What is not acceptable is the $14.99 price, as has been mentioned by many others here. So, I canceled my subscription at the end of the 14-day trial. For what you get, it's just not a good value, at the current price. WSJ, offer this at a more reasonable price and I may reconsider subscribing to it."
2,Great format; can't justify the price,"I decided to do the free trial because I was getting tired of the stack of paper building up from the print edition, and I didn't necessarily want to try to read the online version on my laptop or phone. It's so nice to just be able to switch on my Kindle, download the paper, and read over breakfast, and the Kindle edition is really nice. Ideally, though, I'd like to be able to finish reading articles later online, perhaps at work over lunch, so it strikes me as strange that the online version isn't included. So, while the Kindle edition is nice, I can't justify $180/year, particularly when I usually only get to read part of the paper in the morning and I can so easily read other news sites online for free."
3,Where's the ads?,"I can't imagine a smart guy like Rupert Murdoch doesn't understand that in a major national paper like the WSJ, many readers want and expect to receive the ad content.Perhaps it should be segregated into a separate section so as not to interfere with the ""Kindle Experience"" or whatever but people do purchase the paper for the advertising sections: real estate classifieds, cars, planes, luxury goods etc. if this is somehow contrary to Amazon's policies, then Amazon needs to change since it's hard for me to understand why the WSJ management would suppress advertising in any format."
2,"Low quality, below expectations",This is poorer than I expected. the Financial Times is much better and lower in price too. This WSJ is not the real WSJ in any sense to me.
2,Get This Right!,"Come on Amazon and WSJ, get this right and start building reader-habits of the WSJ at breakfast and on the train. Make the price worth it! The paper should be on kindle for around 9.99. or less. I've got a kindle but will continue the paper subscription until the price is at least comparable."
3,Way over-priced!,"This is a split review. Four stars for content and navigability. Two stars for cost/benefit. Average = 3 stars.I subscribe to and read the online WSJ, and I can do that at my computer and using my iPod Touch with one account. I subscribed to and read the Kindle version for about 2 months and canceled after reading about the upcoming rate hike. It was nice to sit outside with my morning coffee or have the ""paper"" with me if I had an appointment.It was on the edge of too expensive before, but the latest price bump is ridiculous. In addition, you'd think there would be some consideration for existing online subscribers, but no, WSJ claims they're separate, and if you want both, you pay for both. That's strange, because they have ""deals"" for online and print subscribers.Sorry, WSJ - you lost my Kindle subscription, and you'll have to work to get it back."
2,why would they change the price!!,"I am hoping WSJ.COM just shuts down at this point. First I am getting a digitial edition (so saving paper for wsj and environment) and now they are jacking up the price to $14.99!! WHY?? I am not only NOT getting wsj.com subscription, but I am also saving them money and this is how they reward you for your good deeds? Shut down wsj.RS"
1,Subscription pricing is a deal-breaker for getting the Kindle,"I was ready to buy the Kindle until I looked into the price of content. The WSJ and the Economist are absurdly overpriced. Also content is missing like pictures and graphs, making reading less enjoyable.Amazon has to get it together before they truly say they have a quality product. They need to work with content providers to ensure content is delivered in full and print edition bundles (i.e. web subscriptions to content) is the same for Kindle subscriptions. These prices are WAY too high, and it really tarnishes Amazon's brand by gouging their captive customers (those people who have bought the expensive device and are stuck with unfortunate decision on whether to pay the extra money to get the content on the device)."
3,Whats News? MIA?,I had the Kindle WSJ for a few months and loved it but I got tired of missing my favorite section (Whats News). If they would add this to the Kindle version I would resubscribe in a heartbeat!
1,Good by my Kindle's subscription,I'm go back to the printed edition and save $60/year for my children.The printed newspaper has much info compare to the Kindle edition.Amazon's pricing doesn't make sense.
1,Rip Off,"Not only will I not pay $15 a month for the WSJ, but I will gladly pay $10 instead to have the Financial Times. The FT is much more professionally oriented and offers increasingly better commentary. The WSJ still has a wider breadth as well as better coverage of corporate America, but it is not worth the 50% more. I will use the FREE WSJ application on my iPhone and pay FT $10/month for my kindle. Good work Murdoch, you have alienated another customer."
1,Not happy with the price increased.,I just received an update from Amazon that WSJ price is increased to $14.99. Print version is only $10 a month. What's the incentive of getting kindle version then? $5 for saving tree? What a rip off!
3,Good newspaper/Bad price,"I used to have the print and online edition of the Wall Street Journal in college. I enjoyed it because it provides a broad range of information on stories that I wouldn't find anywhere else and indepth coverage on the issues. I recently opted for the 14 day free trial with the Kindle and I still enjoy the WSJ and it is nice to get the digital version sent to your Kindle each morning. I have to agree with other customers though, for 14.99 the price is too high for what you get. The actual newspaper/information you receive is still great, but you only get the Kindle version and nothing else. If WSJ were to offer the online version along with Kindle for 14.99 a month, than I think it might ease the pain.Otherwise, I will just buy a single copy of the WSJ every once in awhile for .99 cents. WSJ needs to go back to 9.99 a month, that seems to be sensible for a Kindle version."
2,Missing graphics are major flaw,"The Kindle version does not include any of the charts and graphs that appear throughout the print version. This makes text references to the graphics meaningless... Additionally, the fininacial data presented in graphic form is also missing.... I'd rather they pass on the few photos they do provide and insert the missing graphics in their place. As others have said, the text content is great, but I've returned to the print version due to these problems."
1,Avid Kindle User - No to Kindle WSJ,"We are orginal Kindle generation One owners and have at present One DX also. We travel for business often and have ALWAYS read both news and books a great deal so the Kindle has been a salvation from carrying many books all over the world. We have been WSJ subscribers, both print and when it became availabe the online version, for more years than I care to admit. However, with the reduced content offered for the DX version compared to the print/online version COMBINED with the price increase this is a NO brainer. I will keep my print/online subscription UNLESS DowJones offeres the WSJ at or near the $6 per month range."
1,Another bad WSJ review,"Enough has already been written about the cost of the Kindle version of the WSJ so I'm not going there. My complaints are twofold. (1) The Kindle WSJ doesn't bring with it acceess to a WSJ online account. I could tolerate the monthly Kindle subscription fee if I could also access the WSJ online. But no! Seems to me that Jeff Bezos/Rupert Murdoch may be getting a little too greedy. But at the heart of it, that's a business decision, and I can subscribe or not in whatever form I choose. (2) The quality of the Kindle-delivered WSJ is very poor. Typos abound. Stories are replete with errant punctuation marks that detract from the readability of the copy and are not found in other electronic versions. Sloppy work, and not what you would expect from a national newspaper."
3,Who Cares About New York?,"I subcribe to the WSJ paper; I love it. Very habit forming. When necessary I do order the Kindle WJS, very convenient when out of town. The Kindle WJS provides a section on New York and seemingly doesn't discrimmenate what section of the country is ordering WSJ, no matter a section on New York is included. I could care less about the NY section while reading the WSJ. Receiving WSJ paper provides a special section on California/ Bay Area, which I enjoy, when that happens. I ask Amazon if they would please straighten this matter so when ordering Kindle WSJ no NY is included as a special section. If not replaced at least eliminated. Thank You.Ronald Mozingo"
1,Price Hike?,What warrants a price hike higher than the competitor when WSJ doesn't even publish on Sundays? Some stuff on the Journal is good though.
2,Bad price increase,"When it was only a dollar a paper before it was acceptable but with the price increase to $ 1.99 a paper now , Itis not a good option now I would rather read the paper version. I sure hope this is not a trend that once readers switch to the electronic version they raise the price as high as the print version. There cost has to be a lot less than the print version. So why not share with the readers the savings?"
4,Great alternative to the print edition,"I was a print subscriber before I purchased my Kindle. I have only a wifi version so it is important to me that I can download the entire paper before I leave for work each day. The two table of contents that are included make it easy to find the sections of the paper I want to read. I can easily store article that I want to come back to using MyClippings. (I will say my clippings is not the best downloaded content and I am fortunate that my employer offers a free electronic edition for any articles I want to print).The price is less than the print subscription, the ease of navigation, and the convenience make this a winning subscription for me.It is also worth noting that the electronic edition contains many sections reserved for NewYork print subscribers resulting in additional content for those interested."
4,Good but can be better!,Its really good but I wish it included charts and data tables. Since my subscription is Kindle Plus and includes the full WSJ.com subscription I'm happy with it.
2,good for temporary use only,"At this price, I would only sign up for a kindle version when I would be traveling, and then cancel when I returned. We already have a WSJ paper subscription...Why don't I at least get a substantial discount for adding a kindle capability?"
2,expensive,"As a long time print subscriber, I found navigating challenging for a couple days. Now I really like the format. However, I find the price a bit steep compared to print and the ability to only look at it on my Kindle and not my iPad is pretty much the last straw. Canceling the subscription today."
2,"Not well executed, too expensive","In addition to the many complaints on pricing, I also find the kindle edition very poorly organized. Articles end up in multiple sections and even get repeated from day to day. I would not be surprised if this wasn't a marketing scheme to make people think there is more content than there really is (again having to justofy their price). After the trials, I am going with FT which is more reasonably priced and cleanly organized."
1,Kindle WSJ Omits Articles,I still get both print and Kindle editions of the WSJ. A number of times I have noticed that articles in the paper and online have been omitted from the Kindle edition. Yesterday they left out the main editorial! In the past i have tried complaining but the WSJ says it's an Amazon problem and Amazon says they can't be responsible for content supplied by the WSJ. Meanwhile this seems to be happening more and more often.My advice is to get the Kindle WSJ only when you are traveling. It's too unreliable for daily reading.
1,Disappointed in Amazon AND The Wall Street Journal,"Already had a print and online subscription to The Wall Street Journal before I purchased my Kindle, but was told there is no way to convert my subscription to my Kindle. Plus, getting a Kindle subscription to The Wall Street Journal will cost me more than my current subscription. VERY poor customer service from both Amazon and The Wall Street Journal on this one. Isn't part of the premise for purchasing a Kindle is that it reduces purchase and delivery costs? Love my Kindle, but WON'T be recommending it to my business associates or MBA classmates until Amazon rethinks its pricing strategies."
2,We need Mileage points as an option- PRICE KILLS,"I have downloaded a few newspapers for trials. I enjoy reading them, and that they are right with me whereever I travel. IT is also easy to sort and clip notes. However, the price kills. I get the WSJ and NY times at hom with my local papers. For both I can use my travel points, Marriott, United, Holiday Inn etc. However, for the kindle it is a very 18-20 dollars per month or 240 a year and increasing. WOW !!! Just not worth it. Even for the delivered subscription I would not do that. As well if I am out of country, I have to pay extra to download.They need to get pricing right and also get access to some of the Mileage or hotel point systems."
1,14.99 price is unjustified 50% increase !! will not renew,I'm outraged at the sudden 50% jump from to 14.99 a month considering electronic delivery is more economicaly viable than paper. I will switch to financial times!
1,Some readers seem confused about WSJ non-Kindle price,".Reviews are comparing Kindle's pricing to the Wall Street Journal's -- first year special -- pricing.Once your subscription is more than a year old, here is how the prices break out (as of February 10, 2011):Per month$12.97 Online (first year $8.63)$14.99 Kindle$30.33 Print (first year $9.93)$36.84 Print and online (first year $11.67)Admittedly, for the first year of a WSJ subscription, the Kindle price is the highest."
2,There is a lot missing...,"Content is bordering on poor. I am sad to see such negligence to tables and material. Pricing is just inappropriate given the content, or lack thereof. Seriously, raising the price to $14 is an insult to anyone who reads this paper.I will not subscribe to this half content paper at twice the price. Come on guys, we put our faith in you-is this the best you can do?Oh, feel free to add the financial section when you have time."
2,Love the product but too expensive,"I get the WSJ at work and I love the newspaper. I don't have a Kindle, but recently ordered the Kindle DX, which I am anxiously awaiting. One of the reasons for the order was so I could read the WSJ on the Kindle... at $10/mo the price was right. At $15/mo..... not so much. I'll still take advantage of the 14-day trial but it went from a sure sale to, now, probably not. I can't see paying $15 when some content is missing and you don't get updates throughout the day. Put it back to $10 and you have yourself a sale."
2,Price increase,"Why did the price increase by $5 a month...did this effect current subscribers..I just bought the kindle and when I bought it, the price was listed at 9.99...now I received my kindle and the price went up 50%.."
2,Just OK,"I like the fact that this saves trees (and saves me aggravation from having to dig my morning WSJ out of a snowbank) but the lack of photos makes it somewhat inferior to the paper version - and VERY inferior to the web version.I'll keep the Kindle version (ditch the paper, keep the web) but it could be better and am hoping the Kindle version improves."
1,I want the Kindle version for the Online price of $104 !,"The WSJ is a fantastic source of information.Here are my feelings about the prices:I will not pay $180 a year for the Kindle version. (14.99/mo.)I will not pay $140 a year for the Print and Online versions.I will not pay $120 a year for the Print only version.I choose not to pay $104 a year for the Online only version which is a OK deal.I would gladly pay $104 a year for the Kindle only version which is my preferred format.I think $2 a week is enough for a gray scale Kindle version. The cost should never be over the Online price.Dear WSJ,Please lower the price for Kindle Gray scale subscriptions.Please ask your techies if they know what can be done with an RSS and Calibre.Thanks"
1,Unscrupulus billing hike,"I enjoyed my subscription to the Kindle version of the WSJ when it was $9.99. Having the WSJ auto-downloaded to my Kindle every day was very nice. However, on 8/5/2009 Amazon hiked my rate by 50% to $14.99 without informing me. I cancelled on principle. Too bad for me and too bad for Amazon."
2,GOOD PRODUCT - PRICE TOO HIGH,"The product is good...the price is too high. I get offers for the print journal at my house for 9.99/month. But, the Kindle edition is 14.99? Come on. I think if it were 9.99 subscriptions would go through the roof."
2,Pricing Matrix Out of Order,"I have had the WSJ Kindle Edition for quite awhile now. This is the first month that I am paying the new and improved (LoL) price of $14.99 month. I will make it my last month of getting the Kindle WSJ. My wife loved the fact that we did not have print versions of the WSJ all over the house originally when I received the digital version. I enjoyed the fact the kids did not toss or lose them also. However with that being said why should I be paying more than the print+online edition of the WSJ? I shouldn't and that is a clear fact. It amazes me that a business focused paper can be so wrong on a business model. I understand Murdoch has declared war on Amazon and the Kindle, I however decide to not be a casualty in this. I will just make the switch to the print version and cut into Mr. Murdochs profit margins (cost of printing, delivery ect..). I guess in a small way I will get the last laugh."
3,"Yes - the price is high vs ""new subscriber"" price for Print, but much lower than the annual print renewal price for Print","I have been reading the various reviews here that complain about the Kindle version at $14.99 per month ($179.88 per year) being higher than the print version at $9.99 per month ($119.88 per year), but you should be aware that the $9.99 per month print edition price is an ""introductory price"", only for new subscribers.I have the print edition, and I just received my renewal notice. GET THIS:Once your first year is up, the print edition renewal price is $8.49 PER WEEK ($441.48 per year)!!!!!So if I switch to the Kindle version, I will save $260.00 per year off the print edition renewal price."
3,Price too high-Already paying too much for necessary goods,"While I do enjoy WSJ and will miss being able to read some poignant pieces before even leaving home, I simply cannot justify the cost with such a terrible economy. With food and gas prices soaring and medications being taken off the shelf due to FDA's over reaching arm, I'm disheartened to see that a digital product would also have the nerve to increase it's price. I've noticed other price increases in general on Amazon. I'm beginning to feel some companies might be just jumping the price-raising bandwagon without the overhead costs to justify it."
1,A Shame Really,"I really wanted to subscribe to the WSJ on my new Kindle. But either the publishers or Bezos (Amazon) have made that experience undesirable and unlikely. Subpar content compared to printed edition. No internet access. Relatively expensive compared to other newspapers. It seems to me that anyone at the WSJ or Amazon that sees the poor ratings for this supposedly premium product would want to improve the value somehow. But it appears neither cares about customer satisfaction for this service. No WSJ subscription for me. What a shame, really."
4,Great Newspaper,I really loved reading the WSJ on my Kindle. However I would like to also read the Asia and European versions as well. I have always found the WSJ to have great financial information.
1,You have me at $9.99,"$14.99 is much too steep a price for a digital subscription, bring it down to a more reasonable $9.99 and I'm on-board."
1,People Complained About Price and Amazon Responded...,"by raising it more! What a disgrace. As an educator, I get access to WSJ home delivery, online access, and mobile access ALL for $99/year. And, as with other e-books, I thought trading in my paper for e-delivery would lower the publisher's, and consequently my, costs. Nope. Many reviewers on here were saying that the paper is great but that the $9.99 Kindle price was nonsensical as most regular readers pay about $99/year. So Amazon responded... by raising the price to $14.99. Seriously? It's really infuriating that Amazon is price gorging us here. How on earth does it make sense to charge me $180/year for e-delivery of a physical paper PLUS online access PLUS mobile access that I already get for $99/year. Disgraceful."
1,Price stopped my purchase,"Almost $20/mo? I don't think so. This price for the WSJ stopped my purchase of a Kindle. It's cheaper to read on a WiFi laptop or phone, and I can take those anywhere, too."
1,WSJ made a mistake,"I'm not going to buy the WSJ now on the Kindle ONLY bc of the pricing issues.I figure even though I am a conscientious consumer and I care about the earth and therefore like the idea of digital print, at the expense of my hard earned dollars, I do not play.I think I'll just go to Starbucks more frequently and pick up one off of a table and read it second hand so the company actually loses my money as a result of their foolish pricing."
5,Wish I had more time to read...,"If I had more time to read I would subscribe to the WSJ for Kindle. As it is, I generally buy a copy when I leave on a business trip and then pick up up additional copies as reading time and WiFi permit. Until I retire and have more time I'll enjoy it one issue at a time."
2,no ink version,"I really prefer the paper version (ink and all), but my subscription had been halted for a vacation hold. I returned home sooner than I had planned so I tried the kindle version. It's ok but I really like the printed version, It's much easier to scan through to exactly what I want. Sooo...final review...e version is so-so."
4,Great When they can not deliver the print one,This was the only way that I could get the WSJ. They could not get it delivered to me for over 6 months. I am very happy with the quality
1,An old gut's innocent mistake - not worth fighting about,"At the time Amazon says that I purchased the Kindle Edition of the Wall Street Journal, I was completely unaware that I had done something to authorize this transaction. I am passed 75 and had not used my Kindle in almost a year because I find it difficult to remember how to do things.When I got a notice indicating that I was being charged $1.99, I could not figure out how to dispute the charge. Because it was only $1.99 I said forget it. I did not touch my Kindle again for several months.Incidentally, I never viewed the WSJ Kindle Edition."
3,Rate Reviews,"I posted an average review because I have not yet tried the product. The posts regarding subscription rates don't make sense to me. I just called the Wall Street Journal and the annual rate to have the paper home delivered is $413 for a long time customer. The annualized calculation for the Kindle version is $239. Admittedly, I'd have to buy a Kindle but for a decent Kindle and an annual subscription I'd still get in under the $413 and have the Kindle for other uses and for beyond the year.Plus, I think the Journal has gone significantly downhill and become a twin of USA Today instead of a decent business paper. This way I'd more easily be able to cancel because the online subscription is monthly. The other way you pay for the thing up front for a year and may have to fight for a credit if you cancel.Looks like I'm going to try the Kindle version and will update my review once I've tried it for awhile."
3,Question re Kindle WSJ,I am currently in my 14-day free trial for this. How do I get yesterday's market data including stock quotes?Very necessary info required.
2,Not worth it!,"As others have noted, the Wall Street Journal print edition is cheaper and includes online access. The Kindle edition is not a good buy.I'm not sure why the Kindle edition costs more! It has less content and very few graphics. I thought I was helping the planet by getting a Kindle edition, but obviously the WSJ views the Kindle as a poor second-class cousin to the print edition.Why two stars instead of one? I liked the Journal's business coverage, and in general most articles outside of the editorials were very well-written.I was a print subscriber for many years, but now I am moving on to better Kindle newspapers."
1,Where is my WSJ?,"I was a WSJ print subscriber from 2000 to 2006. I had to cancel since I would only recieve the paper 4 out of 5 days, when they added a Saturday edition it got even worse. Fast forward to now, I have a kindle with 3G and the wireless is always on. The battery power is good but no WSJ today. I don't know if it is Amazon's fault or Dow Jones' or maybe I am just cursed. I am fine with paying for excellent journalism but you have to actually deliver it. Oh well, I'm going to the library to read it for free. WSJ good paper, bad business."
1,"CAUTION on the ""Free Trial""","I signed up for the ""Free 14-Day Trial"" of the WSJ. I cancelled it after the 14 days, but they still charged me $15. Rip off."
1,Outrageously overpriced compared to print edition,"I've been very happy with the content, although I felt like at $9.99 the price was too high. Kindle books are generally a good bit cheaper than the printed counterpart, but anyone can get the WSJ print edition delivered to their door for $99. So at $120 a year for an electonic edition that costs far less to produce, this has never been a great deal.Now, with a 50% price increase, it doesn't make sense. Anyone likely to read the Wall Street Journal is likely to have enough financial acumen to figure out this is not the way to do it. I'll be canceling my subscription as soon as the price increase kicks in."
1,Not worth the increased price of $14.99/month,"The WSJ Kindle edition was reasonable at $9.99 a month, however a 50% increase to $14.99/month really doesn't make sense for Kindle 2 owners. The timing of this price increase may have to do with the pending release of the Kindle DX. Old subscribers are granted 2 extra subscription period for $9.99/month, I hope that Amazon or Dow Jones comes to their senses before that and reduces the price of a monthly subscription, or I will cancel and simply subscribe to the online/print edition or perhaps the Financial Times (which is still $9.99/month at the time of this writing)."
1,Price Increase is Unjustified,"While is was convenient to have the WSJ delivered to my Kindle, there is no way I am going to pay $15 per month. This was a sneaky move by Amazon to do this. I did not receive any notice of the price increase. I noticed it in my credit card bill. I hesitated to purchase at $10 per month."
1,$15 a month?,"I just got a Kindle DX in order to read newspapers on it. I was willing to try out the WSJ at $10/month which I thought was a little high. Today I went to sign up for a month and saw the price went up. $15/month is way too much, I won't even be trying it."
1,ng with price increase,was ok at $10 but not worth $15. can get most of items on itouch for free. no real attempt to organize for kindle or your preferences. no reason for price increase.
2,Dumped it due to dumb price increase,"I was thrilled when I first subscribed to WSJ's Kindle version. Easy reliable delivery every morning, no paper to have to throw out, hey a ""green"" product I could get behind. Didn't even care that it didn't deliver 100% of the content of the printed version. But then some genius decided with all their cost savings from paper, to printing, to delivery that it was a good idea for a 50% cost increase on the Kindle version. I canceled it. $9.99 to $14.99 boom, overnight. I prefer my Kindle but I'm not a moron. I hope more subscribers follow my lead. Maybe then someone will notice. Just plain stupid."
1,Are you kidding?,"Waste of time. Waste of money. Why in God's name would anyone pay MORE to read online? What idiots at The Journal! How insulting! To think: They will save delivery, save gas (in delivering to your door), save printing costs - and charge MORE??!! No thanks. Complete waste, and highly insulting. When these WSJ executives ""get it"" - when they set this up so that it is cheaper than the paper version, I will be in. Until then: Bye-bye Journal..."
2,Unable to use gift certificates - Can't believe the price increase,I purchased my Kindle thinking that it would make fiscal sense to start receiving my Wall Street Journal electronically. At that time the pricing was $9.99 monthly. Instead I but the Kindle and get hit with a 50% price increase. On top of that I can't even use a gift certificate that I just received for this subscriptions. I specifically asked for a gift certificate for a years subscription -- foolish me I should have gotten the cash knowing somthing like this was going to happen.
3,"I'd love to subscribe, but it just doesn't make sense","I've been a subcriber to the online version of the WSJ since it was launched. I'd love to read it on the Kindle as well, but it's simply not a complete replacement and $99/year is too much for just another way to access it. They really need to have some sort of bundled pricing like they do for the print and web versions.BTW, the same is true for the Financial Times and the New York Times."
4,Cost is the same...with no ads,"I just checked [...] ...the cost of the print edition vs. the cost of the Kindle edition is a wash...same price (maybe those other reviewers got a special deal?)The print edition brings revenue to WSJ through subscription costs and through advertising.The Kindle edition has no ads at all, just the stories, so while you'd think that digital delivery would be less expensive, if you consider there's no ad revenue, the price is pretty reasonable, imho (especially considering auto-delivery each morning and not having to wrestle with the paper on the metro!!)."
1,Why so much more for Kindle version of the Wall Street Journal?,"Like many others, I cannot take timely physical delivery of the Wall Street Journal. I was seriously thinking about purchasing a Kindle and a WSJ subscription. But I found that I can subscribe to the online version for only $8.62/month and read it on my touch screen NetBook. I wonder if it was the WSJ or Amazon demanding such a price. It is a shame that a company would sacrifice so many new subscribers by raising prices on current subscribers. And even many of those seem to be opting out. Sad."
2,Needs pictures!,"Biggest disappointment is no pictures/photos are shown on the Kindle edition. This is frustrating when the article refers to the pic/photo as an important part of the story. One example is when a food article features a recipe but the recipe is missing because I guess it is in the form of a graphic/photo in the printed paper. Another is when a article describes a product and refers the reader to a photo but no photo is shown. Hopefully WSJ will correct the problem, at which time I will subscribe ... until then, I will not purchase the Kindle edition."
3,WSJ Kindle Review,"Decent product for first generation. WSJ needs to provide all charts and graphs that accompany articles. If they can include the dot-photos, they can certainly include more important graphics. They should also include all items in the 'What's News' columns on the front page of the newspaper. No reason to skimp on the content here. All the articles are identical to the newspaper edition, which is very positive. With a little more effort, the WSJ can really make this experience better than reading the newspaper."
2,price. price. price,"I subscribe to the print version. I would prefer to save trees. Why I would have to pay MORE to save trees is totally beyond me. Who is driving this train wreck? I am a professor at a top U.S. business school. I am teaching an MBA course that requires students to read the WSJ. Our MBA students have Kindle and/or iPad access. We are trying to teach them about environmental responsibility and sustainability. Does WSJ really want us to teach our MBA students that it costs EXTRA to be environmentally and socially responsible? If our students were not on limited budgets, it would be a no brainer to have them access WSJ electronically but paying a BIG premium for the ability to do so? I don't think so."
2,KINDLE FIRE OWNERS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS AS WELL.,"When I bought a single issue, my only option was to read the wall street journal through my IPhone. No option exists to transfer an issue to my Kindle fire. Why is the Wall Street Journal so reclusive? It would be nice to have a weekendand/or daily edition for Kindle fire owners; without having to go through hoops downloading an app or accessing WSJ contentthrough a website."
1,Too expensive,bought the kindle dx for my husband thinking he'd love to read the wsj on it. At that time it was $14/month. now it's saying that it's $18/month on amazon and i am reading reviews from people highlighting what you DON'T get fromt he kindle edition and that was at $10/month. Not worth it for $200/year. We'll subscribe if they bring the price down
1,Just So That We're Clear on This...,They're not paying for any paper.They're not paying for any ink.They're not paying for anyone to deliver it to the newsstands.They're not paying a paperboy to deliver it to my door.It's more convenient for them as well as for us.So why exactly does it cost so much? Where is the expense on their part transferring a data file to my Kindle that justifies a $14 a month price tag?
4,More pictures and graphs please!,"The content is fine, it's the WSJ you read already probably. (With the vitriolic right wing nutjob editorials, of course.)There aren't as many pictures in the Kindle version, no graphs, etc. but also no ads (good!).There is no access to yesterday's issue so if you didn't get it downloaded yesterday, so you cannot ""catch up"" if you like or if someone tells you about an article that appeared 2 days ago but you don't have it on your Kindle already."
1,Should include web-based WSJ online,"(monthly) subcription to WSJ Kindle should include web-based WSJ online (maybe with a small additional fee), which now requires a separate subcription and doesn't make sense, as they are exact same content, and are both based on email account.And there should be an annual subscription (discounted) price.Yet this is most certainly NOT how WSJ manage things, as always. And such a common sense approach (for digital content) doesn't even appear to be on their mind.When I called WSJ to ask, the only thing customer service insisted on doing is to direct me to Amazon, while my question is most definitely for the content provider.Guess that's why they were taken over on the cheap by News Corp."
1,this is th worst newspaper!,"one day i was reading this newspaper on my kindle, the articles just cut off.this is morelike the worst street journal.I would rather sit in a trash can than read this!!!!!!!!!"
3,Doubting Purchase,After looking at all the reviews and seeing the increased price.I have decided not to purchase it.See me when he price comes down.I'll just have to watch the TV.
1,Poor quality of journalism,"A long time ago, the WSJ was a great paper. But since News Corp. took it over, it has become just another tabloid. It is basically a cross between the NY Post and FOX Business news, and its editorials are extremely right-wing. I cancelled my WSJ subscription and now read the New York Times and Financial Times - US Edition. The NYT has great domestic coverage, while the Financial Times is more international. I only have time to read 2 papers a day at most, so these newspapers are far better written and have more insightful articles than the WSJ."
1,wonderful excel super awesome fantastic him class ghij fine fins wow in at west fit jest fest deartune mine sine got rest pest,wonder ful super awesome wow kindle classic amazing gut in on ham man went want rest pot top rope pores tum
1,Convienence At A High Cost,"I really enjoyed using the kindle to listen to WSJ as I was doing my morning workouts, but the cost is too high. Will re-subscribe when price is inline with value. Maybe WSJ needs to include on-line edition with kindle subscription as incentive."
1,Price too high for a mediocre product,"Getting the WSJ in near real-time was a big plus, especially since we follow NY by 5-6 hours. I subscribed for the convenience even though the cost was higher than an online edition. Funny thing I noticed is that you can access most/all of the WSJ content online simply by doing a search of titles in google. Not sure if this is intentional or a loophole by WSJ.The recent raise in price to $14.99 is just too much for the value return.I was willing to pay $9.99, but canceled today because of the price increase. Lots of other content to choose, so don't have to look far."
2,"Good content, price increase unreasonable","The WSJ version for the Kindle is quite competent and an easy read. The indexing could be a better, but I read the whole first section anyhow. But the price increase to $180/yr makes no sense. I can buy the paper for $120/yr or I can buy the online version for $100/yr and sync it to the Kindle for free. Seems like the Kindle users are paying for the delivery users when it should be the other way around. As a protest, I had to cancel my Kindle subscription. Maybe I'll try the FT."
1,No WSJ for Kindle Fire,Just moved from Kindle to Fire and found out that WSJ isn't supported? How is it possible to have the text only version available for Kindle but nothing available for Fire? Let's get a Fire version available asap!
2,Subscription Rates Are Unconscionable,"Since late 2011, my subscription rate to the Wall Street Journal has been raised an incredible 44%.My original rate was 14.99, raised to 18.29 in FEB 2012, and is now being raised to 21.62 in AUG 2012.Has the cost of the ether been raising that much?Yes, I will cancel..."
3,Good with Kindle BUT... Needs to work with Kindle app,"I enjoy reading WSJ with the Kindle. However, WSJ is not yet available on the Kindle App. I would also like the flexibility to use my Android to read WSJ. Hopefully it will be available soon."
3,More Expensive then the Print! 50% increase???,I enjoy reading the WSJ from the Kindle but upset that it is cheaper to received the print addition. What is up with the 50% increase from $9.99?
4,Too expensive now,"When the WSJ was first available on Kindle, it was not organized to be easy to find articles and read. They have corrected that problem and I find it very convenient when I travel. I would buy it more often if it wasn't so expensive. I think $2 an issue for a digital paper is exorbitant. The WSJ has lost me as a digital customer. The content is great, but the price isn't."
1,Space Hog,I've been using this app for a few weeks now on my Kindle Fire. I like the readability layout. Having the WSJ accessible on my Kindle is great - so why the low rating? The WSJ app is a space hog. The WSJ app stores a weeks worth of material on the device. There is over 650 MB of content stored on the drive. On the limited 8 GB of memory for the Kindle Fire this is way too much.Once I read an addition I'm done with it and don't wish to have it stored. There is no way to delete the version once you are done reading it. I use my Kindle Fire mostly for multimedia content so this memory hog limits my content. As much as I like being able to read the WSJ on my Kindle Fire I'm going to cancel my subscription because it's a memory hog.This app would be a 5 star if there was some way to control the storage to the current version then discard it when done reading - just like a normal paper.
1,priced way too high,"I tried it at 14.99 for a couple months, but could not keep going when the print edition was being offered for $1 a week."
2,Why change the table of contents?,"I bit the bullet over the high price, but this latest change to the table of contents, with no warning, is the final straw. I can't find the sections I want easily and, with only two or three articles per micro-section, I spend most of my time flipping back and forth trying to find what interests me. I'd rather just save the money and try to find an alternative."
2,Good service but at a premium,"The WSJ is far and away the best researched and written business newspaper on the market. Having the WSJ delivered electronically every morning to my Kindle is a great convenience. However, I cannot justify paying the price premium over the standard print subscription knowing that the electronic delivery cost is substantially less than print. Even more puzzling is that the same price premium apparently justified by the 3G network access also applies to my Wi-Fi connected Kindle."
1,15.00 wasnt bad 19.00 is stupid,"I cancelled my subscription when the price jumped to 18.29. Corporate greed at work again, way to go. When will it end? Probably when Americans finally decide to do something about it."
1,Shocked at the price even before buying the Kindle,"So I was considering buying the kindle because of the newspaper feature, but just looking at the price for the WSJ at $15/month is just a rip off. I'll just stick with my online and print version.Amazon, you're losing out on a lot of business because of the price increase. Look at how many 1 star ratings there are due to price - most of them unsubscribed."
3,"OK, but too pricey","This is great is you travel, but too expensive for home use. Get the print edition instead."
1,This is a rip off,"No matter how you slice it. for the kindle edition you are paying 40 to 60 dollars more per year if you get it on the kindle. I see no justification for that. Seriously, what is Amazon and WSJ thinking???"
1,ridiculous...unreadable,"If you want to read every word of the Wall Street Journal in order, this is for you. If you want to browse a newspaper and read what you choose, this is unworkable."
1,Canceled due to price increase,Not worth the price increase. Canceled after one year and went to other publications.
1,Thanks for the reviews... I'll be passing.,I just ordered a Kindle and was looking forward to subscribing to the WSJ. But I can't imagine paying more for the Kindle version when the print edition and online edition is cheaper with more/better/color content.I'll be passing on the WSJ Kindle edition.Thanks for the head's up everyone!
2,Somewhat useful but prefer the entire journal,"I would like more content. The articles are useful but I need the quotes and charts, also. I prefer the entire paper."
2,Increased price really hurts the wallet. No pictures too.,"I've been a subscriber of the Kindle WSJ for 2 months. It's a little disappointing because it lacks most of the graphics found in the print edition. Furthermore, the Money and Investing section of the daily/weekly chart of the indices is not provided; therefore, you must read the article to find out how the overall market performed. Lastly, the $5 increase that happened a day ago increases my cost by $60 on an annual basis. Like others have noted, this does not make sense when there are deals to get the print and online version for $99. Instead, I'm paying $180 ($15 * 12 months), even though I'm helping the environment by not having someone drive it to me.I also forgot to mention that the iPhone can get articles for FREE. It makes me feel even worse."
3,Kindle looks like a bargain,I've been a subscriber to the WSJ since the 1980's. I just received my latest subscription renewal notice and it is for $349 for a year. That is much higher price than any previous person has quoted. Plus the paper is 2 to 4 days out of date by the time I receive it. That is enough of a reason to buy a Kindle and subscribe even though I cannot get wireless delivery. Downloading it through the web has to be more timely than my current delivery.
1,Really Amazon?,"Sorry Amazon, this was definitely the wrong move. This is almost a 75% premium to the buy the Kindle edition of the WSJ. Kind of risky considering how primary the ebook market is right now don't you think? Your abandoning a large market for the Kindle by doing this. CANCELLED."
1,Pricing Stupidity,"AS probably most others are saying, the pricing of this is absolutely stupid. $180/yr for something that can be received in print for only $119 goes against the point of the kindle: ease, portability, and cost effectiveness."
1,digital wall street journal,"At the revised increased price (nearly equal the news stand price), the digital plus Wall Street Journal is not worth it."
2,"Kindle Edition is OK, online great, iPhone app is sadly lacking...","This is an update of my original review...The content of the Kindle version of WSJ is very similar to what you would find getting the print edition delivered. There are some things missing such as stock quotes but that's ok because it's easier to look up and read stock quotes and such on the web. The format makes navigating the paper a bit cumbersome. Graphs, photos, and other graphics are poor in the Kindle format. It helps that this subscription comes with WSJ Online and iPhone access. WSJ Online is very good and the iPhone app is terrible. Not only is the content via the iPhone app incomplete, you have to put up with ads!Considering the new cost of $21.62/month or $.072/day I think the cost for electronic format is way overpriced considering its deficiencies. I am seriously considering canceling.6/2/2012 Update: I have canceled my subscription."
2,Only halfway there,"Enjoy my Kindle for reading books -- very convenient.However, newspapers are more than text. Their article lay out and placement on a page, font size, and pictures are important aspects of my reading experience. The newspaper page layout makes it possible to quickly skim through articles, picking the interesting ones.At this time, the Kindle Wall Street Journal is only halfway there. The articles are listed but not pictured in a page layout. They can be read individually, but easily scanning for interesting articles is impossible.I will be staying with my print edition for the near-term."
2,Overpriced,I have just canceled my subscription to the WSJ on Kindle. Price went from $9.99 to $14.99 a month.The hard copy paper with more content plus pictures is cheaper.M.J. Pressler
1,The WSJ forgot about the customer a long time ago,"Having subscribed to the WSJ print/online edition in three different states and four different cities I can assure you their service is substandard nationwide. It is no surprise that with the Kindle they have delivered a substandard product at an inflated price. Having just received my Kindle DX as a gift, for the sole purpose of reading dailies and weekly's, I am strongly considering returning it to Amazon and saying thanks, but no thanks."
2,Price is ridiculous!,I am a wsj print and online subscriber. i bought my kindle on the expectation that i would be able to access my account on my kindle for free or a small annual fee. I am disgusted that i have to pay 15.99 per month to access a newspaper i already pay for. i would have spent more on an ipad if i had known this. At least then i would have felt like i had got my moneys worth
1,unreasonable price.....,"It is very hard to believe that the price for the WSJ on the Kindle is so high. I am not a regular reader of it and would keep it on the Kindle if the price would be more reasonable. At this price, I am going to drop it. Hope everybody does the same!"
1,Cancelled.,Thought I'd throw my two cents in with the rest. Was happily subscribed to the Kindle Edition WSJ at 9.99. But 14.99 for a less than version of the Web / Print content killed that off. A shame too. Even though it didn't have as much content as the other subscriptions it was still pretty good for the price.Hopefully they come around and actually listen to their customers.
3,Needs Better Implementation,I do like reading this on my DX but.....Electric version should be better than paper version its not. The section view page only list how many articles in each section. You should be able to expand each section to get compete title and first paragraph and jump to any article. Sadly you need to page through the whole section to see what articles to read.It should also show what articles you already read like any other kindle book on your home page.Im writing this on the DX you notice I have no other punctuation available to me in the review besides this . and / whats up with that////Amazon please upgrade software of all your old kindles and DX/////
1,PRICE INCREASE Again???!!,The $14.99 price was already high enough. Another price increase is completely ridiculous. Do they really believe access to the WSJ website and other devices is worth additional three dollars? Pure Greed. Greed. Wonder how much they'll jack up the price next time for what reason.Furious. Furious.
4,Works for Me,"I don't have the online or print subscription, so I can't comment on the comparison between the three. I do really enjoy both the content and the Kindle structure. It's easy to jump between sections, look at graphics, and change the font size. I love that I can read the WSJ any time and any place, without having to carry that morning's paper around with me. It's expensive, and I don't read it every day, so I'm not sure it's worth the cost, but daily papers are expensive and I don't think there's anything wrong with a publisher charging for a very, very large amount of original content."
1,Paying more for less,"The whole reason I bought my amazon kindle was to have my WSJ subscription cancelled and delivered via kindle. I was floored when I saw that the price of WSJ kindle, which comes without many features of WSJ print, costs much more than print. This is not just with newspapers though, it is with all Kindle books/products. Amazon, what voodoo do you do that justifies paying more for less? What a rip off.If you are reading this and thinking about buying a Kindle, STAY AWAY. It's a cool idea, but pricing for ANY content will be so expensive you may as well buy the print version of what ever you were thinking about e reading.Better yet, buy mine so I can be rid of the cursed thing. Haha. Seriously amazon, fix your pricing."
3,Kindle edition of WSJ vs paper edition.,"Kindle edition of WSJ is too expensive compared to the print edition, therefore I am not going to subscribe to the Kindle edition."
4,"WSJ kindle, almost there ...","Tried the WSJ kindle edition, well it is almost there. You have to get used to the format. You don't get the overview of the paper version. The short lead of each article is not there which is I like in the printversion.Nevertheless, a good function and easy to navigate."
3,"Good product, but could be much better by giving online access and multi-Kindle discounts. Why not?","I'm complete addicted because it is convenient - it shows up about midnight west coast time, so I can read it late or as early as I like. It is easily searched and well organized.What should be better? Three things: price (a particularly bad move was the 50% price increase with no increase in value), and online access to the Wall Street Journal web site is not provided. That's just plain dumb - and should be fixed. If the online web site access was provided, this product would be an easier sell at $14.95/month. For families with two kindles, it would be nice to at least have a break on price... it is not reasonable to pay twice, the paper version had an advantage about sharing and the online even more so.I travel a lot - and having the Wall Street on my nightstand next to the bed every morning I wake up - well, I'm happier with this than the paper on my door step at home, or the online on the web."
2,overpriced,well I bought a Kindle to get the paper & save trees...then they raised the price! I think I will continue to get the WSJ with airline miles and save my money fo books.
2,Price Increase made me leave,I had this for about a month and it was ok. It was well organized. I think it is way overpriced though.
5,Song of a Soul,"As always with Lawana Blackwell's books, a good tale and a no put down untill it's finished kind of book."
1,Doesn't work as a Voice Modem,"Two different programs, including the one that came with the modem, do not recognize this as a voice capable modem."
3,An OK Modem but Maybe Not for Linux,"Despite the fact that this modem is advertised by some as a ""Linux"" modem, it is unsupported by open-source linux drivers. The only linux drivers available for this modem are proprietary and come on the disc with the modem. The drivers are written for several specific versions of specific distros, virtually all of which are two or more years old and have been supplanted by more current versions. If you are running a version of linux other than SuSE 9.1/9.2, Mandrake 10.1, Red Hat 8.0/9.0 or Fedora 3/4, forget about this one- it is a winmodem and you will never get it to work."
1,Is not compatible with new motherboards,The product description says it is compatible with systems running vista. Computers running vista and windows 7 have newer design motherboard. This card did not fit into any of available slots on my windows 7 64bit mother board. I return the items for refund. The one start rating is for quick delivery as was expected.
2,"No, it's not the Calla that I know and love.","To me, Calla has sold out. Don't freak out, that's just my opinion. Gone is the slow, depressing drone of old. It has been replaced by mainstream, poppy rock N roll beats. If you like that, then by all means, check this out, you will probably enjoy it. It's a change that I personally don't appreciate. That is just my musical taste, and everyone's tastes are different. I don't see this as an extension of Televise, it's a completely new direction for Calla, I applaud them and wish them success. Unfortuneately, I will not be joining them for the ride."
3,Seems too rushed,"What I love most about Calla is their layered sound, along with their almost languid delivery. This CD sounds like someone in the studio was saying, ""Come on guys, let's give it a little more POP!"" Not a good idea. Calla and cheery should never be used in the same sentence. (I'm not saying it's all doom & gloom, but they're not the Archies....)"
2,Indoy,"Sterile alt-rock derivations prevent this group from maintaining interest, though it might not prevent deceit when convincing blooming hipsters of its independence."
2,It dawned on me......,"I heard It Dawned On Me over the radio and I liked the song but listening to the clips, it dawned on me how terrible this album is! Aside from It Dawmed On Me, the only acceptable song is Initiate which reminds me of Coldplay, the rest is plain filler. Therefore buy the CD if It Dawned On Me caught your fancy otherwise forget it."
2,I am not sure of this one yet??,"I am not certain whether Iike it or not??Difficult movie..funny at times, boring at times. I must need more viewings, before I can review it.. That must be it.Annette Benning, is lovely as always...always lovely....but kind of witchy in this this. She does not do ""witchy"" well, she's too lovely...I think...I believe that she is miscast, here in this...not sure , yet?"
3,Drama queen.,"Being Julia starring the talented Annette Bening could be the only reason to watch this film. Bening's performance earned her a Golden Globe, she is marvelous and has a great sense of humor to play a woman who's husband is cheating on her. This film is a bit slow and overwrought at times but Bening can do anything so with that being said just watch it and see why she is such a great actress. Jeremy Irons ain't too shabby either."
3,"Disappointing, Overacted Vehicle for Benning","One of the previous reviewers said that any capable actress could have handled this role and I agree. Benning did an adequate job but the part invited overacting and it got tedious after a while. The best part of the movie was the final scene in which Benning, the aging star, got her revenge on the scheming young rival and on her own faithless husband as well. That part I found very funny and almost enough to redeem the rest of the movie. However, the rest of the cast really did not have roles to get their teeth into. Jeremy Irons was suave and debonaire,and probably the best thing in the movie, but even his part was fairly slight. Juliet Stevenson, who can be absolutely wonderful, simply had nothing to work with and was wasted. And Benning's young lover was so colorless as to make you wonder if she had taken leave of her senses in becoming so enamoured of him. In all, I found ""Julia"" to be disappointing and a bit tiresome."
3,dont fret annette; gertie lawrence didnt win an oscar either,"essentially little more than an overblown star vehicle for annette benning, portraying a 1930s stage actress in an overblown star vehicle. there is just a bit too much of ""the-a-tre"" smugness to appeal to a general audience, but the audience its intended for should lap it up. strong supporting work from the likes of jeremy irons, michael gambon, and a delicious miriam margolyes (if you recognize that name, this movie is for you)."
4,"Being Julia -- I laughed, smiled, and was glad that I watched it.","Annette Benning's dramatic, humorous, and stunning performance in ""Being Julia"" is what (for me) pushes this movie from three to four stars. Not just any actress could pull off playing the curt and witty diva-like personality of Julia Lambert, but Annette does and she does it well. I feel her performance bares a resemblance to Betty Davis's in ""All About Eve."" Also the other actors (Shaun Evans, Jeremy Irons, Lucy Punch, and Tom Sturridge) performances are not to be overlooked either. I especially thought Lucy Punch did an amazing job playing Avice Crichton, the young tart who fancies herself an actress. This is a well-written film and one not to be missed. I enjoyed it. I laughed, smiled, and was glad that I watched it. The DVD contains the following special features: Commentary by: director István Szabó, actors Annette Bening and Jeremy Irons, Making of featurett, Behind the scenes featurette, and Deleted scenes."
3,"A pleasant, funny costumer with some bite","Annette Bening is fun as an aging diva who wants to shake up her routine and show everyone, especially competitive younger actresses who are encroaching on her territory, that there's still some life left in her. Also on the plus side, the movie moves along at a brisk pace and is much funnier and sexier than I expected. If you like movies set in the world of theatre, there's probably nothing here that you haven't seen before, but ""Being Julia"" ably delivers on the conventions of the genre: the backstage bickering, the affairs, the backstabbing, the hired help indulging the every whim of the diva but not being afraid to take her down a peg or two when called for, etc. The DVD extras are modest but interesting, mostly consisting of videotaped behind-the-scenes footage of the production in progress."
2,"Love the Performance, Hate the Character (Spoiler Attached)","In ""Being Julia"" Annette Bening gloriously reafirms herself as one of today's most nuanced film actresses, in both the film's over-the-top and quieter moments. But why we should care about this foolish, vain, self-centered, adulteress drama queen is beyond me. Particularly at the end, which the filmmakers plainly see as Julia's personal triumph over her adversaries. But what adversaries? No-one's to blame for the pickle she finds herself in more than herself. So how is publicly humiliating an innocent -- albeit annoying -- person a triumph? It's petty, cruel, self-serving, unprofessional behavior. And that she should be rewarded for it is completely implausable. I understand that the film is meant to be fluff, but even fluff has to make sense. The marvelous supporting cast, most notably Juliet Stevenson, helped enormously to keep my attentions from completely waning."
2,Being Manic,"I wasn't to thrilled about this one. Benning's character is so unlikeable and not in a Bette Davis All About Eve kind of way. Although the film does have some of the same diva theatrics.Benning's perfomance is best described as manic (and she does do a good job at it) but again, she really is not a likeable or sympathetic character. The others turn in decent perfomances, particularly Juliet Stevenson, but it still isn't enough to keep this one really entertaining."
5,Movie for my mother-in-law,"It got here just in time for her birthday, and was something she had been dying to see, but missed. It was perfect, and I don't know anywhere else I could have snagged that VHS. So, thankyou!"
3,WEAK COMPARED TO WHAT MAKES A RAINBOW,"We got ""What Makes A Rainbow"" as a gift and the baby has loved it since 3 weeks old. It is one of our very favorite books and it inspired us to try this book, but the music chip was defective and the story is weak. Maybe our timing was off in terms of when we introduced it, but our baby never got interested in it."
3,Wish it worked the first time,"I ordered two copies of this book. It is charming just like ""What Makes a Rainbow"", though I was disappointed to discover that the musical sound chip in both copies was defective. I've ordered replacements, but am hesitant to recommend this book."
3,"Neat book, music chip defective","Its a short and simple book that introduces the 8 note music scale. The ribbons are a neat concept and hold up well. The music chip at the back was defective from the start.We sing the doe-a-deer song with it sometimes--because the story is simple. It is a clever book though, for finding a concrete way to explain to very young children the concept of music notes. You can't go wrong with it, my seven year old likes to read it too."
2,Incorrect condition,"The item arrived very quickly and that is why I gave any stars at all. This book was listed in good condition. It would be generous to give it a 'fair' rating. Since this is an interactive book, you must take that into consideration when describing the quality.The ribbons in this book are all wrinkled and folded. The book is fairly beat up in the front and back cover. Most upsetting, the pop-out on the very last page was destroyed. Completely inoperable."
4,Nice crayons,"My 20 month old son loves these crayons -- they color well, clean up easily and don't dissolve. However, the crayons keep falling out of the plastic holders. This bothers me more than it does my son."
2,"Great Concept, but majorly flawed","My 2 y/o daughter got these as a christmas present, and I thought they'd be an instant hit, because she loves to color. Well, she was super excited to use her new ""colors"" in the bath, and enjoyed them for 2 bath times until the crayons began to fall out of the holders and break. She was left with little nubs to color with. I understand that the manufacturer was trying to create a fun product that was easy to use, but the crayon holders are faulty, and don't do what they are supposed to. I think if the product was redesigned to work better, or just simplified so there are no holders for the crayons, it would be better."
1,No.,"I honestly never owned this product, but think of what it teaches our kids...that it's okay to draw on walls. I mean, what's the difference of a tub and wall to a child? Just a thought."
3,Not the Greatest,"The crayons are only half the size of the holder- not such a big deal to me- the fact that they quickly fall out is. once they're out of the case, my little one can quickly break them into many pieces, get them under his nails, and to be fair has a hole heck of a lot of fun with them. You cannot get them to stay in the case. I didn't have a problem with any staining. So in a nutshell. My kid enjoyed them, but I will never purchase them again and I would only recommend them if you only want to play with them one time. After this product I bought theseStar Crayon in the Tuband they are awesome and very durable."
1,Waste of money,"This product has potential if the holder were redesigned. The crayons (amazingly small compared to the holder) fall out of the case all the time. My son tries to color with them, but if he tips the crayon upside down or sideways, out comes the crayon into the water. The crayon itself seems to color well but I can't recommend anything else about them. If they made a case that actually would hold the crayon and allow it to be advanced a little at a time, that would be great."
1,A terrible product,"We purchased these for my daughter and were disappointed by their shoddy performance. All the crayons fell out of the holders upon the first use and don't stay in their holders, making it frustrating to use them. Some broke when the fell in the tub or my daughter threw them. They seemed to have shrunk from being in the water. Sorry I bought them."
1,Huge Disappointment,"I don't understand this toy. It's supposed to be for drawing in the tub, but it doesn't work on wet surfaces. Two of the six crayons broke the first time we used them. Don't waste your money on this."
4,Fun Toy,"My 2.5 year old daughter was given these bath crayons for Christmas from my sister. I was a little worried about them staining so I checked the reviews here first. The reviews seemed mixed, but my daughter was so excited that I decided to give them a whirl. I told her to only write on the side of the tub, not the tiles on the wall because the crayons on the grout seems to be the problem. They washed of the side of the tub no problem with the sponge provided. My daughter could even do it!One of the crayons did fall out of the holder, but I was easily able to put it back it. We had a happy bath time and I'm sure they'll be a hit until the crayons are gone. For those who did have a problem with stains on the grout, I'd try a bleach pen."
4,Good for strengthening writing abilities,"5 year old loves this! The holders suck, but we have had no issues with the markers not washing off. She enjoys writing in the bathtub, and this is a good way for her to improve her writing hand as suggested by her kindergarten teacher."
1,Sponge doesnt clean anything! Crayons fall apart!,We have the set by the same name brand that come in a fish that holds the markers. They are great! We bought these as replacements to put in the fish...they are HORRIBLE!!! They fall apart when my daughter tries to draw and the sponge that is meant for cleaning the marker...all it does is smear it! HORRIBLE!!! My daughter LOVED the 1st set! Used them in the tub at least once a day until they were nubs! I dont know whats was wrong with this set?!?
2,Started out great and went WAY downhill!,In my first review I raved about these crayons -- five stars. They were really great! ***UPDATE: I purchased these same crayons again and they're HORRIBLE! Not at all like the previous batch. They're impossible to push up or retract and get mushy and disintegrate! Can no longer recommend.
5,Apron for Artists,"I am an oil painter, and during the winter wear a smock when painting, and when the weather warms up, an apron. I've gone through a lot of aprons in fifty years of painting, and this has to be the closest to perfection, of any. If you are an artist, you can't go wrong with this apron."
1,not so sweet,"after reading this book i wanted a silkwood shower. i thought it might be sexy & fun. not so much. this woman is a feminist??? she deliberately degrades herself for men by whom she is disgusted. for some reason, although she has a good job, she is ""drawn"" to stripping. but this is the most disturbing part: she actually thinks that her boyfriend who is okay with her near-prostitution & who lives off her ill-gotten money, is ""supportive"" & she considers that ""lucky.""also it's not very well written & isn't particularly entertaining. after a while, the relentless repetitive seediness got me down.basically, just pointless & sad. the writer lacks any insight into herself or the horrific world she insists on inhabiting."
4,A classy book about a classless trade!,Wonderful book and very entertaining. I was really suprised by the amount of content in the book. It was very vivid and well told. I will never forget this book!
1,The world's most fatuous 'hipster',"This reads like a self-involved teenager's dark fantasy of life in the demi-monde.The incessant use of 'big' words she obviously doesn't understand and the generally narcissistic and self-involved nature of the prose would be off-putting to anyone but the most non-discriminating reader. And the whole 'pushing-the-envelope' b.s. regarding her vile antics rings false and hollow. It's like a 5-year-old girl pulling up her skirt to show her underwear and giggling, thinking she is just so clever. Wow, thanks, we never thought such things existed. Yawn.Anyone who enjoys this drivel needs remedial English, fast.Brook, dear, go back to being a prostitute."
4,More than you'll want to know,"Candy Girl is the memoir of a woman who spent a year working in the sex industry in Minneapolis. The book reveals facets of the industry known only to insiders, and it leaves the reader with a negative feeling about the author's experience. Still, I consider it a useful, truthful report. If you're looking for an erotic experience, you won't find it here."
4,Well written documentary about an unliklely stripper,"Diablo Cody documents, in an insightful way; the life and world of an occupation that is so stigmatized by society. The life of a stripper. She brings to life what these unfortunate women must go through in order to earn a decent living in order to survive. Read her book with an open mind and you will come to appreciate single mothers and women that have amibitions beyond the strip scene make this choice. Stripping, can get some women beyond the working poor if you are smart and have a little talent. How sad a commment for our society."
2,Cluster fact,"It is an accumulation of isolated experiences, abrupt thoughts and pretentiously shocking metaphors. There is no beginning, middle or end. It does cover a year's worth of stripping, but it is not enough to engage a reader who is looking for something other than a compilation of facts in chronological order - the story does not develop or evolve, it simply starts and ends. The observations about stripping lurk on the surface of mediocre psycho analyses that don't go deeper than what the eye meets or the ear hears: she sees and hears things and so she types it out on her laptop and sprinkles it with flavorful allegories.It does read fast and keeps you entertained, but don't go looking for insightful or eye opening revelations. If People magazine twists your brain - you will feel very satisfied reading the book."
2,Poorly Written,"Narcissistic and myopic, this book is overwritten and almost devoid of insight. The author of this book tries to make every sentence memorable and a zinger. The effect of this style of writing is like turning up a thrash metal song album to high volume. There are no levels, no quiet spaces, just one long smart-alecky shout. The book is also lacking in insight, either into the author's motives, the dynamics of the strip club, or the girls or patrons involved in it. The one good thing about it is that she does not shy away from describing the fundamental depravity she participated in and yet simultaneously acknowledges that there is some strange degree of glamour in the business. Nonetheless, you are left with the impression that the author started stripping knowing nothing and left stripping knowing less."
3,A hand party when you want a happy ending,"If you liked ""Juno"" you'll like Candy Girl--it's got the same kind of witty repartee and engagingly sarcastic voice. But, like Juno, it's also frustratingly superficial and self-centered. Cody's in her own world for much of the book and doesn't seem to have had much interaction at all with her fellow strippers, many who sound like much more interesting characters than her persona as a slumming hipster. It's a fast, fun read, but you end up feeling a bit cheated and wondering if Cody is really as skin-deep as she seems."
3,Meh... a little too haughty,"I wanted so badly to like this book. I like the author's style as far as her smart-alleck attitude, but I didn't like how superior her voice sounded. ""Oh look, I have lived, I stripped for a year"" ""oh, strippers are stupid - well, except for me"". That's kind of the 'voice' I heard. I'm a huge fan of Juno and I'm glad I saw the movie before I read the book - I probably would have skipped it.The story itself is interesting for the things that it exposes about the industry (the pay schemes for instance), but the haughty attitude of the author ruined this one for me. There were also a few scenes (the licker) that made me feel a little ill, I may be a little queasy though ;)At the end of the day, I'd say read this one if you like memoirs, but go in knowing that you may not love it."
4,Strip and the City,"I picked this book up at the library and felt a little shamed when a granny volunteer leaned over my shoulder as I was checking out and said, ""Oooh, naughty!"" I laughed out loud a lot in Diablo (real name?) Cody's memoir. I also cringed a lot - not so much at the writing, but at the various incidents at her various jobs. Cody's at her best when mid-story - her observations are hilarious. Sometime the writing is a little TOO smug, like she's trying too hard to be clever, but overall a captivating read."
4,a trip out Book,"from start to finish once you read this book you are gonna be tripping off so many things that went down in the Author's world.very Honest,Funny&striaght to the Point. very good Book."
3,What did she say?,A book written by a socially privileged girl who wanted to slum it for awhile....that's really it.Some parts of the book were very entertaining but the book is written in such a condescending tone it was almost unreadable.3 stars for a fast read.
3,Only one year?,"Not bad, but I'm super jealous of her story. It took me 8 years to get out of that biz! Ah, well, don't over think it and be entertained on a rainy afternoon!"
4,fascinating read,"Sometimes Diablo Cody's pop culture references and slang gets to me, but for the most part I think she's fabulous. As a big fan of the United States of Tara and Juno, I had to read Candy Girl. I found it very interesting, fun to read, and at times disturbing. I'd been warned by friends it was really raunchy and disgusting but I didn't agree with that. I wasn't too shocked by its content. But it was riveting all the same!"
2,"Meh, boring","I didn't find Diablo Cody's story to be funny or entertaining in the least. Her character reminds me of the girls that used to run in the local ""punk rock"" circle. They'd do anything for attention and cry ""Look at me! Look at me!"" although there was nothing special about them. Diablo seems intent on shocking the reader, but it comes off as tedious and crass. Two stars because it does provide a behind-the-scenes peek at the Twin Cities sex trade, but otherwise a boring disappointment."
3,Bird's eye view of a life on the pole.,"Intelligent memoir about a profession where intelligence is the trait least required - stripping. Ms. Cody decides to try stripping on a bit of a whim, during a local amateur night. Even as she left the club that night she knew she would be back. She ""wanted to feel the way I had onstage again. Agitated. More vulnerable that a newborn fawn still mottled with placental muck. If I could have recaptured that feeling by parachuting or finding God or backpacking to Marrakech or anything, I would have. But only one thing would hit the glory spot, and that was stripping"".Cody's quick mind and original language are a definite plus.While I read this book I was aware of the voyeurism involved, both by Diablo herself, and by me by being intrigued.The title is apt as she does spin a frothy, candy coating on stripping although some parts, particularly her turn in the ""Doll House"" were downright sickening."
4,Behind the scenes at strip clubs,"Engaging read though it starts a bit slow until she goes to an amature strip night and tries out. Decides she wants to look into it more. She does well with words, she works in an office handling writing, she has moved to MN to be with her boyfriend who is actually married.Goes through the experiences at differnet clubs and how they work. Talks about names gals use, back-stage in-fighting and the way the managers treat the gals. Also about the VIP. She ends up doing 'Girl in a Box' and reports on the oddities involved in that.She gets back into dancing but after a year of the sex industry work she has had enough and gets out. Similar toBare: The Naked Truth About Stripping (Live Girls)as she is a middle-class gal who is a writer who it appears decides to dance and then write about it and gets a book deal. I did laugh a bit, she is a wordsmith and witty. Her boyfriend is very supportive, sounds like a good guy."
4,Fast and Easy,"This book was recommended to me by a friend. It was easy for me to get into from the first pages where she meets her boyfriend on a Beach Boys fanclub website. Being I met my boyfriend under very similar circumstances. The one big difference being I didn't go into stripping. Ha!The book is just over 200 pages and a VERY fast and fun read. There are times where she useses words bigger than my vocabulary, and I get this feeling that they might be used to prove that she is smart. I know that sounds bad, but they just sometimes seemed misplaced.Over all it was a very interesting look into the sex industry and whether it is embelished or whatever I'd give it a solid A-."
1,Contains what may be the most offensive line I've ever read,"Until I got to this line, near the very end, I thought the book was ok, though I too was troubled by the too glib writing style and the touch of oversimplification and arrogance I felt the author displayed. Then, towards the very end, she wrote what may be the most offensive sentence I've ever read in a book: ""I was never sexually abused as a child, probably because I wasn't pretty.""What???What does appearance have to do with sexual assault at any age? This trivializes the experience of all sexual abuse survivors, and is just horrifying on so many levels I cannot believe her editor let it stand.It soured the whole book for me, which frankly wasn't that good to begin with, but until this point at least hadn't been horrifically offensive."
4,Behind the Stripper Curtain...,"Long before Diablo Cody was grasping a golden statuette for writing the screenplay to ""Juno"" she was spinning around a stripper pole for cold-hard cash. If you ever wanted to know what it was like to be a stripper but didn't want to discover the hard way, this is the book to read. It's not only funny, but downright insightful on how much strippers make and end up having to owe the House. Diablo Cody takes readers backstage to explain in graphic, sticky detail everything from lap dances and bed dances to VIP rooms and girl-in-a-glass box experiences. Think of it as Strip-ipedia for the curious and those of us too shy to shimmy stark naked on stage for seedy strangers. I'm secretly hoping she writes a screenplay for this saucy memoir."
1,Ok but not what I expected.,"Until I got to this line, near the very end, I thought the book was ok, though I too was troubled by the too glib writing style and the touch of oversimplification and arrogance I felt the author displayed. Then, towards the very end, she wrote what may be the most offensive sentence I've ever read in a book: ""I was never sexually abused as a child, probably because I wasn't pretty.""What does appearance have to do with sexual assault at any age? This trivializes the experience of all sexual abuse survivors, and is just horrifying on so many levels I cannot believe her editor let it stand.It soured the whole book for me, which frankly wasn't that good to begin with, but until this point at least hadn't been horrifically offensive."
3,"Witty and amusing, but ultimately disappointing","Amusing, often witty account of one girl's downward struggle from junior advertising assitant to dolled-up stripper to peep-show fodder for onanists. Diablo Cody doesn't sweeten her prose for the old lady in Dubuque--so be warned, this book conjures up some unsettling images that will stay with you for a long time. She wasn't a great success as a stipper, and the answer probably lies in her contempt for her customers. That's the problem with the book: there's a mean-spirited side to Diablo's account which ultimately drains much of the fun from her story. By the last chapter, when we finally get some biographical data about the author, one can't help but conclude that she's still much too tied to her middle-class, mid-western, tongue-clicking roots to relish the absurd humor in what she saw and experienced."
2,Pretty boring...,"I normally read most autobiographies, I thought this would be interesting, but this one is boring. It might be interesting to someone who is naive about strip clubs and wanting to learn. I'm taking it to the used bookstore next weekend."
4,Raunchy Good!!,"Ok so the irony about my reading this book is that it was suggested to me by a dear friend who is an extremely dignified social doyen. The book reads like a bad history of a free clinic so you can imagine my amusement upon finishing it.My only issues with Candy Girl are Cody's obsessive need to rip on Minneapolis and its locals (I'm from here and, no, my skin does not look like silken tofu nor do I have an insatiable appetite for Manwich), and her tendency to write as though this book was intended to be read by an angry emo at a poetry slam (it has a choppy rhythm and she's constantly speaking in metaphor).Aside from that, Candy Girl is wickedly delicious! Readers beware; it is EXTREMELY raunchy!! I love anything to do with train wreck pornography and even I was squirming at certain points. All in all, I loved it and I certainly have a whole new respect for my ""lily white"" friend!Rating: 4 out of 5 starsSuggested With: A dirty mind"
4,Fun Fast read,"A great summer read. I breezed through it in a few hours. Funny and super interesting. Everything you ever wanted to know about being a stripper and everything you didn't want to know, too. I loved it."
4,Candy Girl for boys with sweet tooths,Well written and a really good insight to the world of stripping with all of it's human emotion and human frailties!
1,",",this woman uses the worst metaphors i've ever read. she manages to insult absolutely everyone and everything she describes - and the reader at the same time
5,Great collection,This is one of our favorite CDs. The title track is so sweet but sad it makes my wife tear up every time she hears it. Highly recommended.
1,JUNK! DO NOT BUY ANY TREKSTOR PRODUCT,"Actually, I give this POS zero stars. Bought this for a friend. Acted a little wonky at first, so I tried to do a firmware update in order to solve the problem. Right in the middle of the update, the SOFTWARE shut the player down and killed it. No response from their tech support. No surprise because this is a German company and I doubt they care about overseas sales. Save your money. Buy something else."
1,Horrible!,"This product requires that you first download a CD onto your comp before the computer even recognizes the MP3 player! I downloaded everything 3 times and my computer would not recognize the MP3 player. I spent hours on it! Also, their costumer service line is in Germany and they have no costumer servies in the US. Therefore, no one can help you. Good luck trying to figure out how to use it!"
3,Not that helpful,I did not find the video very helpful. I found more useful info on the internet from other sources and from talking to other moms. The video did not answer many of the questions I had and focused too much on the products they want you to purchase from their website. You don't need a doll to show your kid how to use the potty. All you need to buy is a bag of gummy bears!
5,Review of Vern Gosdin - Gospel Album,"Love it, we listened to it in the car the other day and lovehis choice of songs. His voice is amazing, sorry we lost him too young."
5,Highly Recommend this CD!,Vern Gosdin sings great gospel and country music. This gospel CD was a gift to my dad and he loves it.
2,N. Roberts Born Trilogy Cassette Collection Review,"I could've sworn that this was a CD collection, not tape. I'm sure the story is great but I'll have to wait until I can figure out how to convert tape cassettes to CDs..."
1,Buyer Beware - Not a good line-in option,"This device offers practically no control of line-level inputs. I purchased the UA-1X and was very disappointed. I had hoped to use it with my laptop as a line-in. However, I found the unit completely bypassed the Mixer in Windows, so no level adjustments could be made in XP. The unit has a two level input gain switch, but I found with the unit connected to the preamp out on my preamplifier that the high gain setting resulted in excessive clipping, and the low gain setting was too low. Practically useless as an line-in unless you have a separate external gain control to adjusted the level prior to going into the UA-1X. I would not recommend at all as a line-in. I am returning and searching for another device."
2,Great workout/Cheap videos,"I actually own the basic, intermediate and advanced Stott Pilates videos. While I love the workout, I was highly disappointed that the tapes malfunctioned after a few months of use. Both the beginner and intermediate tapes I purchased wouldn't play - I had to open the case and manipulate the acetate to get the tapes going again. I thought this was odd since I still have tapes that I bought in the early 90s that work with no problem today. When I emailed the Merrithew Corporation - the Canadian company owned by Stott that makes the tapes - to complain, they promised to send me replacements, but never did. The sad part is that I also gave a Stott beginner tape to my mother as a gift and it malfunctioned as well after a few months."
2,"not bad, but not tood good","i have tried several of her videos, but Stott Pilates always leaves me wanting more, so i go buy other instructors videos. She is ok, but overall this video is not worth it."
5,Very satisfied first timer!,"I never did Pilates before, but I've done yoga and other workouts so I went right to this intermediate tape. I'm a ""quick study"" and beginners tapes tend to bore me quickly. I REALLY enjoyed this workout, it was difficult at times and I even broke a sweat! I'm a stay-at-home Mom with two kids and this is exactly what I needed to energize me! I like the instructor very much, she's very calm yet motivating. I'm hooked on Pilates!"
3,Review,I would have really loved if the correct songs would have been listed for the cd. I did keep it but I was disappointed that the song that I wanted and was listed did not come on the cd I received.
3,Once Upon a wheel,"The Opening song really is awful,the racing sequences are never too long and smacked and edited together but there is some ""Superbirds"" Cars from The Stock Car/""AeroWars"",there is some silly smelly hippie music,No Corvettes!(WTF?!) not enough Can-Am Action,More Open Wheel and Stock Car Stuff than any,But there is Snowmobiles!ATC'S,OffRoad(No Trucks),And even no wheels!(a Speedboat!). For someone not growing up or even being born around the time this came out it is entertaining but I have seen and I have myself better Racing footage than this."
3,Dissapointment,"Bought it on vinyl. I didn't realize it was an EP, silly me. Only one side. Which would have been fine if it weren't $20 out the door. I love BJM. Been to a show in San Francisco before, and I have tickets to their show in May pinned on the wall right in front of me. I agree with another reviewer that the girl singing is annoying and the first and last tracks are the only good ones. In fact, the only song I even LIKE enough to listen to again is the last track, which I really like. Wasn't anton hooking up with this girl at the time? Isn't that why she's on here?"
5,BJM forever,"YOu can never compar the dandys to BJM, more like the dandys wanna be like anton and bjm....... BJM is and will always be the best band out there...... this new ep is great, everything from them is great.... i recommened thank god for mental illness...."
2,Anton the genius is nowhere to be found on this one!,"I am surprised to see such great reviews already for this disc. I have been a BJM fan for many years, right around the time they started. This disc is a huge letdown. First I will begin by saying that Anton is a genius and it shows in his music. Unfortunately, not much of that is to show here. The first and the last songs are the only real decent songs here. Frankly, the female vocals annoy me. By the way, I love female vocals but these are just pretty drab in my book. The use of electronics (if that is what it is on songs 2,3,4) does not add anything. The disc is mega short and quite a rip off for $9. I feel that Anton took us for a major ride on this one. I just hope he bounces back in a great way for the next release. Even though I don't reayy like this ep so much, I am still glad to support one of the last true rock n roll bands/Anton."
2,Future Embrace - Massacring The Massacre?,"PEOPLE, I COME TO YOU AS A PROPHET. HEAR MY WORDS. TAKE THEM AS BOTH WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT AND WORDS OF WARNING. THIS MINI-ALBUM IS TALENTED ORIGINAL MUSIC. HOWEVER, THIS MUSIC IS NOT THE MASSACRE WE ALL LOVE AND RALLY AROUND. AS A PROPHET, I REGRETFULLY PREDICT THAT THE MASSACRE'S NEXT ALBUM WILL SOUND SIMILAR TO THE STYLINGS OF THIS RELEASE.""The absolute worst thing that can happen to a prophet is to be wrong. The second worst thing that can happen to a prohet is to be right."" - Aldous HuxleyI AM THE ONLY PROPHET IN HISTORY WHO HOPES TO BE PROVEN WRONG."
4,Somehow some birds have flown,"I am a little bit disappointed with this book. It is beautifully edited and beautifully printed as any book edited by twin palms is, let there be no doubt. One would only buy these books because they are so beautifully edited.About half of the photographs really work. About the other half I have this feeling that these birds have flown. I have this feeling - but I could be wrong - that some of the photographs were sought to fill enough pages as to come to a complete body of work. I highly value the work by Graciela Iturbide : half of the pictures would have made a book twice as thin but really more than three times better. Anyway, for anyone who loves real photography I recommend this book."
5,The first one.,"I've had many backpack's in my life. This Jansport is the first for this company. I like the colors and that it's a good size for me. I was worried that it would be too small, but it's just right. I can't wait to show it off."
3,"It's Big, but not big enough for me","I just got this backpack yesterday. It is very durable and seems like it will last, but it's not big enough for my needs. It definitely seems small in the photos and when I got it, it appeared the same. The reason for a new backpack was to get something really big for college, but this one is not big enough (was same size as my old one). The High Sierra Access backpack has a 2800 cubic inch capacity. If it were big enough, I would keep it because its a great backpack with great colors. Just disappointing that it wasn't as big as I hoped."
5,lotsa room,"I've always been a fan of Jansport. Getting a bag that has all the pockets I need and the support for my shoulders/back, has been paramount for a student like me on the go. Sometimes, I have to carry tons of books and need my 13"" laptop too. Add to that sustenance (like water and a sandwich) and a sweater. It has so many nooks and crannies, I even use it for storage for my stuff, while it's parked in my room. I have tons of other bags, but this design is the only one that doesn't strain my back when I carry all that weight, walking from class to class or one end of the campus to the parking lot. I specifically chose this Big Student design because of the many compartments that suits the amount of stuff I need to carry around with me on a daily basis. I also like the water bottle holder outside the bag. I also really love the padded shoulder straps."
1,warranty is pure fiction,"If you live in California, close to their repair shop, their warranty might be judged as real. The fact that they have NO authorized repair shops around the country, none at all, zero, means that their 'life time warranty' is useless. (They count on this, I'm certain. Much cheaper to do business. Good for stockholders. Bad for consumers.) It is way too much of a burden and expense to box up these large items and send them across country (in my case). It is also a huge time commitment for the bag to be away - numbered in weeks depending on how busy they are. I just paid for my repair locally (in my case it was a whopping $25), complained to Jansport bitterly about their ridiculous policy, and promised to stay away from their label from now on. Suggest you do same."
3,Didn't like the plaid. Otherwise 4 stars.,"I bought this backpack thinking the white plaid would be a bit funky. Somehow it just struck me as unattractive. Your mileage may vary. I did repurchase the same backpack in Navy and I'm quite happy with it. It is big, and holds a load of stuff. I wish there were an integrated laptop sleeve, but it will accept a 15 inch Macbook Pro quite easily in a separate sleeve. 3 stars for the color. 4 for the function. Integrate a laptop sleeve and make it out of 1000 D nylon instead of 600 D, and it would be 5."
1,Jansports Big Student Backpack(navy),Returned the product as it turned out to be small not the same thing as the video tends to suggest.2. for the price not very well made it Their are better and cheaper options available at Costco
3,Having problem w/ the zip,"the zip doesnt work smoothly, and sometimes make you feel really mad about it! and the band does hurt the shoulder when put a few heavy college textbooks in it.Not recommend !"
5,Jansport always!,I always go back to a Jansport! Don't even waste your time with others just because of their namebrand. Jansport has a wonderful guarantee. I even put them in the washer at the end of every school year and they still come out great!
4,Jansport bag,Very durable & roomy-- great buy! My daughter brings home at least 15-20 lbs of books each day & this book sack has held up nicely!
5,love it,My 9 year old got this from Santa and loves it. It is very roomy for what she needs for school and more!
5,JanSport Big Student Daypack!!!,This JanSport Big Student Daypack is all that it says it is. I cannot believe the amount of books that this bag can hold and the straps are very durable. My son is very happy with this bookbag.
4,"Stylish, roomy, excellent quality backpack","I actually bought this backpack to replace my 2 year old sons baby bag. My husband hated having to tote around his diaper bag everywhere because it looked feminine and was heavy. This bag looks better and holds a lot! The s straps feel kind of weird. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it holds a lot but is pretty bulky. It looks huge on my back. But not too bad on my husband. The color is nice, although I was really hoping to find a black and white pinstripe instead (but I couldn't find one)."
1,Way overpriced for what it is (which is a piece of crap),"The pic is very misleading -- the backpack looks sturdy and padded, but the real product, when you get it, isn't that at all. Total lack of padding, especially on the bottom, makes it good, maybe, for carrying laundry, but certainly not for books and laptops. Forget about the laptop -- it's totally unsafe to carry it inside this flimsy sack. Way overpriced for something that may have cost one lousy dollar to make."
3,"An ""okay"" daypack","We ordered this backpack (Jansport Big Student School Backpack in W/B Camo) for my son, who is a fifth grader. He LOVES the pattern--and I admit it's pretty cool. It is also spacious and has the right amount of pockets for him to organize homework materials from personal items and still have a pocket left for easy access to his independent reading book.My real concerns with the bag are that the zipper is a bit sticky, especially on the curves/corners, and that the fabric is SO thin! We are looking at ways to provide extra layers (particularly on the bottom of the bag) so that it doesn't scuff/tear right through.My son is ""all boy,"" so this bag will take a beating. I don't expect this to last the whole school year...and, for the price and the Jansport name, it should."
5,A 20-day test,"I just returned from a 20-day trip, and this new backpack went along. It is comfortable, commodious and just the ticket. I have a 25-year-old JanSport backback (still ticking, but a bit tattered) that I have used and used, and I expect this one will provide the same service. It's great!"
5,Great student pack!,"Bought this pack to replace my similarly designed Jansport from about 13 years ago. Took that long for one of the zippers to finally start losing some teeth, resulting in the zipper continually popping off! The new pack feels much lighter and the material feels considerably more synthetic or plastic-like, as compared to the old packs, which had an almost canvas-like texture. It almost makes this pack feel ""cheap,"" but I hope that is not interpreted negatively. It's not a bad thing --- it just does not have that heavy-duty feel of the old Jansport packs. The multitude of pockets are well designed and operate well. The S-Straps are nice but they feel like they need to be broken in a little bit before they really feel natural. I keep my laptop in the large compartment, housed in a protective case, along with a few books and other supplies, and the weight feels fine and manageable on my back. Great pack for students."
5,Great backpack!,"My daughter just entered high school and is enjoying her new backpack. It seems big enough to hold all of her stuff, and she says it is easy on her back. Great color too!"
5,Great school pack,"This pack works great for my middle schooler. He can easily fit all his binders in, it is well made, and has good support in the shoulder straps."
4,Recommended,"I bought the big student backpack after reading good reviews. I've had the backpack for 1 semester of college in which I carried 3 very heavy books among other folders, schools supplies, etc. I was afraid the backpack would tear at the seams under the weight but it didn't! I definitely recommend this backpack. Jansport also has a lifetime warranty that will replace or fix your backpack in case it ever breaks. It is also very comfortable on your shoulders and has plenty of pockets and space for miscellaneous supplies. My only complaint is that the zippers get stuck sometimes which I guess is only expected, but as I stated earlier, if the zippers ever break, Jansport will replace or fix the pack for no charge. Overall great quality and highly recommended!"
5,"Practical, big, durable",This backpack can carry a lot of stuff without looking oversized. Seems well constructed and has survived more than a year of my use and abuse without any visible wear.
5,Happy,My son if very happy with the backpack. The large section holds all his books. The smaller pockets are useful without taking space away from the main section.
4,jansport backpack,"The backpack is a great color, even better then the picture. However, it was not as big as I thought it would be, and there is not a pocket for a laptop."
1,Way too small!,"I could not believe how small this backpack was. My son needs a bookbag for middle school and there is no way this would hold even half of what he needs for school. The name ""big student"" is way off!Have been trying to return this for months now, but this company has such horrible customer service. Will never buy from them again."
4,a good compromise,"numero uno: i used the free shipping for this item and i received it THE NEXT DAY. i can't imagine using amazon again if they didn't give me next day shipping for free!as for the backpack: it's not the perfect backpack for me, aesthetically. but it is comfortable and large enough to carry a laptop, a large jar of chunky peanut butter, four large file folders, a spanish textbook, a bottle of water (full), a power cord, mouse, jump drive, pen, pencil, ethernet cable, sweatshirt, notecards (2 packs), headphones, checkbook, moleskein sketchbook, etc. And there was room for twice as much.all i'm saying is that it seems like a pretty sturdy and practical backpack. and it's hard to find sweet backpacks."
1,Big Student Backpack,"I had to return this item. It was much smaller than I expected. Instead of fitting a big student, it seemed perfect for a four or five year old. Was not pleased at all with this product."
2,Disapointed,I was really excited about getting this backpack because it was my favorite colour lime green and it`d be great for college. I opened it up to find that it was a dull green and not at all how the picture on Amazon looked.
4,good,"It is a very nice bag and i like it very much. however, there is a small problems that it cannot defend water."
5,JANSPORT,"Perfecto.LLEGO RAPIDISIMO, MI HIJA ENCANTADA , EL BOLSO HERMOSO, MUY BIEN EMPACADO, CALIDAD SUPER . EXCELENTE TODO , LO COMPRARIA NUEVAMENTE ."
4,JanSport Big Student Backpack Review,"Bought this backpack for my 13 year old in Grade 8. She wanted something attractive and BIG to put her binders, books and other stuff. She's quite happy with this. Enough room for it all... and no rips yet like her other backpacks. Would recommend."
3,It is big but I thought it would be bigger.,This is a nice back pack. I just thought it was bigger. I love the small pouches in the front with its big pocket space. It has another compartment that I use for a 17 inch laptop which fits really snug. The main compartment is big but not big enough for me. I am taking 16 credits this semester and just barley fit all my books and notebooks in it. Jansport should just make 2XL model of this backpack and that would be perfect. Over all it is getting the job done. The straps are a little stiff but I assume they will break-in over time.
4,Not as good as it used to be...,"I have purchased several of these for my teenage son over the years and see many other boys carrying them. This latest one has no padding on the handle loop making it very uncomfortable to lift with all those heavy books. The ajustable webbed straps are narrower, consequently the plastic cinch the strap threads through are smaller. This concerns me because the plastic cinch broke on my son's last backpack resulting in this purchase. The padded shoulder straps are stiff and dig into your armpit.On the good side, the pockets are the same and the zippers are good quality and function properly. This is still the best backback around."
4,"Super light, supersize","I got this for my 6 yr. old son, even though it is big, it is really lightweight. The straps are great, there are plenty of pockets and the 2 main compartments make it easy to carry school work and separate gear.It looks better than the picture and he got lots of compliments. It will be good for him for a long time. The price was great for a Jansport pack."
4,"Good Bag, not necesarily for travel",This Bag is of average size. It's good for carrying few things. But not for traveling which is exactlly what I bought it for. Still Im keeping it.
5,Great,My daughter has a lot of homework and brings home a lot fromschool and this backpack is sturdy and does not rip or tear.
5,jansport backpack,"I got this backpack 4 years ago, the summer before my freshman year of high school. I love it. It has a ton of compartments for you to put things in and it's huge. It fit all of my binders/notebooks perfectly every year and it didn't feel too heavy at all. I'd also take it with me when I was travelling and such. I think that the quality of this backpack is amazing -- it still works perfectly fine today, except the color has faded a little and a strap tore a tiny bit (easily fixed). If you're looking for a fairly large, useful, and durable backpack, this one is definitely worth the money."
4,Review for Jansport Big Student backpack,"This backpack is made of sturdy lightweight material and is big enough to fit several large textbooks. The material is also pretty waterproof, and the shoulder straps are comfortably padded. One of the reviewers mentioned that the straps might be uncomfortable for smaller people, but I have not found that to be the case and I am pretty small (~5 ft). They're actually more comfortable than the old Jansport backpacks with the straight straps. The only thing I don't like about this backpack is that the lining material makes really loud crinkly noises so that everyone notices when I open my backpack and fumble around inside looking for something.The color that I got is called 'white little echo' and there are little peace signs, butterflies, flowers, and hummingbirds on it. This pattern can look a bit childish on adults even though the amazon picture looks fine when not zoomed in. It doesn't bother me since I tend to look young for my age."
5,perfect backpack for school,"I bought this backpack for my son who is starting high school. The Kings Plaid fabric looks great and seems tough enough to make it through the year. Also, it has plenty of space for lots of books etc."
5,The best we've experienced so far.....,"So far, after 2 months this is by far the most sturdy bookbag we've tried. It's held up to 42 pounds of high school books and binders Monday-Friday. Very satisfied with purchase."
2,No as big as we expected.,"My middle school boy have folders for each subjects, but the bag can not fit those folders that he need daily."
5,Great Buy!,"Black Animal Frenzy ... Received within 5 days! The colors are very vibrant and bold. For a Jansport backpack and the price, it is an overall great bargain."
3,JanSport Big Student School Backpack,The backpack has a lot of pockets. It is a big bag but the laptop part that they advertise has no padding at all. The shoulder straps also hurt my neck from rubbing.
4,I like it but the forge grey is not as pictured at all!,"There must be a different grey color for this bookbag because when I received it, it didn't look anything like the photo at all! It's just a grey color and nothing like the picture. Unless this is a mix up do not get forge grey the picture looks much better than the actual thing."
5,Sweet!,"Very sturdy, long lasting, and looks amazing! :) It's a great deal, and comes with a warranty. I love cheetah, zebra, and rainbow."
5,Just right,"Great backpack, great price and plenty of great smiles. Bought this backpack for a gift and she loved it! Thanks."
5,teenager backpack,Sturdy and cute! A great gift for the student who carries a heavy load. I have washed it and has gogne through wonderfuly.
5,"Durable, roomy, perfect for middle or high school","My (middle school) son has been using this backpack for school for about for months now and is very happy with it. It is very well built, has lots of room and is stylish. I am sure it will last him for many years."
5,Excellent backpack for highschoolers,"I bought this backpack for my highschool going son. His old backpack was unable to accomodate all of his books, and everyday was a struggle to put all his books and folder in it. So, after reading reviews on several backpacks I ordered this one.This backpack is very roomy and accomodates all of his books, folder, etc comfortably. Backpack itself is very light though strong so weight comes from mostly the content and not the backpack (unlike the old one).It has adequate number of pockets for keeping a lot of other things like calculator, pencils, etc. But doesn't have a laptop pouch. At least for now, highschoolers don't need laptop to school so that was not a concern.My son is very happy with it. I will recommend this as a very good backpack for highschoolers."
5,"Cute, efficient, and durable","I bought this for my daughter, who is entering high school. After using an L.L. Bean backpack bfor 3 years, she was extremely happy upon receiving this Jansport backpack.She liked the color ""Shell Tan"" much better, which is exactly like the picture. The color combination is great, and the cute pink zipper color continues on the inside. The design is also better: there is an extra pocket near the top for smaller things such as pens and a cellphone, and an side mesh pocket for a water bottle was convenient. The bag looks very small upon arrival, however, when filled it can stretch to almost too big, yet the perfect size. My other daughter has had the exact same backpack model for three years now, and it is going strong still, without much wear and tear.The bag is very comfortable, stylish, and well-designed according to my daughter. As an added bonus, it's a great deal on amazon! I highly recommend this bag for students in middle or high school and college. Buy it!"
4,classic,classic design...well built...comfortable to wear..Large size makes it easy to take everything at once
5,Jansport big student backpack,"Just what I was looking for. The biggest, deepest backpack I could find. Nice padding on shoulder straps. Good price. Better than buying in the store."
5,Nice Backpack,"Great quality, nice print, it has held up well to a lot of tossing around and stuffing full! My 10 yr daughter is very happy with it."
5,Great product!,"Great quality-- I've had it for a year, and no rips or tears yet (I'm really hard on my backpacks...)."
2,WHAT A RIP OFF!,"I ordered the shell tan backpack. The bag is not the same color as you see in the picture. I am very disappointed. I expected the color of the bag to look exaclty like the one in the picture, but instead its an uglg brown backpack."
2,Ordinary Backpack,"I purchased this backpack for my high schooler, who always seems to run through backpacks incredibly fast. The review made the product seem superior than other backpacks, and it was more expensive than the ones I usually find at our local mass-merchandise store. The backpack turned out to be nothing more than the ordinary ones we buy.If your child isn't carrying a heavy load of books on a daily basis, this would have worked; however mine does, and this backpack is no different than the cheaper ones at any store."
3,Backpack,Clearer picture next time please so that it is easier to see what is being ordered. Other than that very good service.
3,Nice backpack for light school days,"My daughter has a sturdy backpack in perfect condition for the past 3 years purchased at the Children's Place. However, the pattern is childish, so she picked this out for middle school. She loved the colors and all the pockets. Though it can hold a lot, it seems to me that that is dangerous for a child (or anyone for that matter) to carry so much bulky weight. It doesn't seem that sturdy (it's almost sheer in spots) and I have a feeling it may rip before 1/2 the term is over. We hope not."
1,JanSport Big Student Backpack,Very thin fabric. sent back because we didn't feel it would hold up the 45-lbs that our child has to take daily.
1,Jansport Big Student Backpack,"Its an allright backpack. I thought for the price it would be a heavier material. It's quite thin, and I cannot put all of my college books into it for fear I will rip the backpack. Just not the same backpack as they made inthe 90's. I should of went to Wal-mart and bought a 25-30 dollar backpack with the thick, ruggage material I was looking for. I will not buy ever again."
1,A Major Disappointment,"I was appaled when I got it for severale reasons. the most obviouse of which would be that the colure is not what thay show at all, but thats just the begining. the zipper works poorly and there is next to nothing as pading in the back. It also does not deserve to be called a big backpack, it holds like 6 books. I`l never get another one."
5,Backpack,"We bought this backpack for our daughter. This is the model she selected, and she is absolutely delighted with it."
4,customer satisfaction!,I RECIEVED THE JANSPORT BACK PACK QUICKLY IN GREAT CONDITION I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH MY ONLINE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE. I will be using Amazon for my Christmas shopping also.
5,GREAT BOOKBAG!.,"It's perfect, holds everything!My son has homework every night and his books are huge, plus his after school clothes fits in the second large pocket."
3,Zipper issues,"This backpack's boxy shape, excess protective fabric over the openings and stiff material make it nearly impossible to get the zippers to run smoothly. Decided to return after 2 frustrating minutes."
4,does what it needs to do,"I picked up this backpack to replace my old gym bag. It does the job, it's not perfect, but it wasn't meant to be a gym bag. I've always like Jansport and hope to have this bag for some time. When it dies I'll send it back to Jansport for repair/replacement. Gotta love Jansport."
5,JanSport Big Student Backpack (Black/Carbonic Punky Houndstooth),"YES I ordered this item for my son and he was so surprised when he got it,and he couldn't believe how much room it had,(he loves it) thanks for a great product and price."
1,----- Disappointment,It's a lightweight bag. They have a lot choices of color and fabric. But the 'S' shape stripe doesn't fit on my girl well. I personally dont' think the curved stipe is a good design for female. We still like the traditional straight back stripe. I have to return this. ........... *Be Aware that customer have to pay for the return shipping fee.
3,Sigh...not what it used to be,"When I was in high school several decades ago, I remember my and my friends' Jansport backpacks being much sturdier-built than this one. I bought this sight unseen for my nephew just because he specifically asked for this brand backpack for his birthday, otherwise if I were in a store looking for a non-specific-brand backpack I am sure I would not have picked this one.As the previous reviewer noted, the materials and build quality simply do not impress. I guess Jansport is just living off of its name cachet while outsourcing production to the lowest bidding sweatshops in Asia, like all too many product brands these days."
3,"Good backpack, wrong color",My daughter was very sad when she opened the box only to find out it was the wrong color. Due to receiving it just a week before school started she decided to keep it. The product itself is fine. We searched for the backpack all over town and could not find the color she wanted. We ordered it online specifically to get the color she wanted and it was wrong. Very disappointing.
5,Great Backpack!,Very roomy and the perfect size for a senior in high school! Very durable and stylish too!! Couldn't ask for a better product! This backpack should last all school year!
5,Were Talking about Jansport here!,"I have owned this back pack for a whole year now and it is still great! Jansport Backpacks are the most used in schools. If you go to a high school I can almost guarantee that most of the students you will see are wearing a Jansport. With this said, this a high quality backpack that is Big! It is way bigger than the basic Jansport backpacks and have a nice design. The new Straps on them are better than the original ones that most backpacks tend to use. The interior of the backpack is big, so you have a lot of room for books, notebooks, and even a Laptop. The front pouches are great for calculators and carrying pens. This is Jansport were talking about here, they have a really great reputation and I wouldn't hesitate buying one of these Backpacks as they are one of the best. I hope this review helped you out."
4,Jansport never disappoints,We were looking for a BIG backpack essentially for school use. This item was delivered on time and is as per expectation. Its not a heavy duty item though it will survive a couple of school years.
5,"Didn't need replaced, just the color changed!?!?!? Kids!","These back packs are the only brand and model my wife and I will buy for our children. The only reason we replaced them was to change the color and/or the style. They are high quality and are extremely durable! Once they went through the wash they were as good as new! Now we have three extra back packs lying around for whatever occasion may warrant the use of them. We found the best prices for them through Amazon.com, of course! A highly recommended product by me, for what its worth!"
4,JanSport Big Student backpack,"I have been very pleased with the backpack. I searched for one that would be able to handle my stuff for work and school and yet have a little bit of personality. I am older, but still like more than only black bags. The straps are sturdy and the many different compartments helps keep me organized."
4,Great Product,"Great service, great product. The bag arrived quickly and well packed. The bag is what it was discribed as. Thanks"
5,"Great backpack, great color selection!",My son is grade 5 so he wanted to get a bigger backpack. He picked this and we both think it's great and should last a long time.
5,Serving him well!,"Everything a Jansport backpack should be, this was replacing a backpack my son has used since high school. (10 years)"
4,It's ok,"I like the size, but have to be careful of not putting too much stuff in and killing my back. Wish it would have had nylon pockets on both sides for water bottles or easy/quick access of things (specifically like to put my phone on the other side)."
1,Big? yes! Junk? yes!,Bought 2 of these for my kids. One broke in one week. The other broke in about 3 months. Terrible!
5,Nephew's JanSport Daypack,My nephew loved the daypack! He is a Freshman in high school and has to carry all his books with him all day since he doesn't have time to hit his locker in between classes. It's big enough to allow him to carry them as comfortably as possible! Thanks for the great product and the great price!
5,Very good quality and super cute!,"Love it! I fit so so much in this backpack (my huge 17"" laptop, 3 textbooks, and all of my toiletries). It's held up now for over a semester. The white attracts dirt but it cleaned up very nicely in the washer! I still get compliments on it all the time. Not a fray on this thing after 5 months! Yup, love it!"
4,Good bag,I needed a roomier bag than usual. This bag is perfect in the sense that it is not huge to carry but is roomy enough to carry all the stuff I need to carry all the time. It does not feel big or bulky.
5,Great Backpack,This is a great sturdy backpack with lots of room for middle and high school students. Not too bulky and just enough of the right sized compartments.
5,Good so far,"I'm really satisfied so far with this bag. I am a commuter so I need a really big bag. This has helped me so much!!. I actually had a messengers bag before, it was horrible! This is really great so far, and it doesn't feel heavy (as I said I'm a commuter, so you can imagine the amount of books I carry!). So if you are looking for a pretty decent bag at a good price, this is a good choice. Also, Jansport has a lifetime warranty so if it should tear they will replace/repair the bag!"
2,Color shown was NOT accurate. Jansport is great quality though.,"My son wanted a Jansport backpack again this school year. He has gotten one every year for the past 3 years and wanted a darker green color this time, (he has had a dark gray and a black in the past). We looked around and found this one. We couldn't care less about the High School Musical beanie set. We were shocked when the package came and he opened it. The color is lime green! Needless to say we will be sending it back asap. The color is not horrible, but my 14 year old son is not going to carry around this all year...Or ever. If companies are going to sell online like this they really need better photos and/or descriptions.The one positive thing I can say about it is that the shipper got it to us very quickly.I will post a ACCURATE photo myself for others who may be interested in it."
4,review,"It is very nice product, I would have put more protection (rougher material) in the low area, that touches the street etc, so it would last more. But so far the product is fine."
4,good,"The backpack has plenty of space but it's a little hard to zip and unzip the zippers due to a zipper cover except for the small first one, that one is not covered and is easy to zip or unzip. From 1-10, I give it an 8."
4,Great!,This backpack was a gift for my daughter. She is 14 and loves it! It was exactly what she wanted.
5,great backpack,"Good sturdy pack, holds all my High school aged daughters school stuff with room left to spare. Well designed back pack."
5,WONDERFUL,This is a wonderful backpack. Not only is it very durable and sturdy it is also stylish! A must have!
4,Holds a lot of stuff,"This backpack can hold SEVERAL books and binders but I'm a little disappointed that the bottom isn't covered in leather like the old Jansports used to be. I bought one of these at Costco back in 1999 for about 20 bucks and it was 10 times sturdier than this guy. But, I have yet to tear or rip this bag, so I guess it's okay (until I do!)."
2,Shoulder Pads Painful,"This backpack is so pretty and so practical but unfortunately it just didn't work for me. The shoulder straps pulled down on my shoulders and neck, giving me a neck and back ache every time I carried it around campus:/ Not thrilled with this purchase- I went back to my trusty LLBean backpack."
4,Great Buy!,"I love this back pack.It has plenty of space, its got lots of different storage compartments as well.The only thing I don't like about it is the straps.they are really hard at first but hopefully after some use they well soften up a bit."
4,Surprising hold all!,I've been using a swiss type back pack and it's larger than this. I was amazed how this packs almost everything i need. Highly recommended!
5,Jansport Big Student Backpack (Navy),"Great backpack for middle school, high school, and college students. Can hold lots of books. Durable and well designed. Thanks."
2,Not a Quality Product,"I was hoping with a name brand like Jansport this backpack would last for the rest of my boys' school days. However, upon receipt of the backpacks the insides were lined with a cheap, thin lining. I immediately returned them due to the price for a cheaply made product. I was disappointed."
4,Reputation stands.,"I stole my sisters old Jansport backpack in high school and it lasted me into my early years of college when I was gifted with a new bag. I'm in grad school now and none of my current bags can withstand the book load and not strain a shoulder or neck. I finally gave in and shopped around and found the prices and the lifetime guarantee unbeatable. I can carry everything I need and then some. The divided pockets let me take gym gear and text books and the side water bottle pocket easily houses my Sig, freeing up my hands when traversing across campus. There is no specific padded laptop pocket but you can easily fit one. Sturdy and comfortable I'm a brand loyal customer."
4,Very sturdy backpack,"We bought it for the simple design and operation to use it to haul around stuff for three kids at Disney for a week. It is a great, sturdy, no nonsense bag. The one thing I wish it had was a strap across the chest to keep the straps in but hey, it's not a hiking backpack. Of course we only used it a week but it held up great. No noticeable wear on the straps, seams, or zippers. I think it's the same design I had from the bag I used all though middle and high school."
3,Its ok,Price and backpack was ok...but the backpack just feels uncomfortable. The zippers also are hard to close sometimes. The straps feel weird when wearing the backpack as well. I wasn't too impressed with my backpack.
3,Not the best,"I purchased this bag based on the size and the high reviews. Come to find that although this bag is very big, it does not have any internal padding for a laptop or fragile items (it's just the canvas type material with zippers). It was comfortable when I loaded it up and put it on, however it also does not have many smaller pockets for smaller items (iphone/ipod/keys). I love the pink color, however I don't like the way the bag is organized. Wish it has some smaller pockets for pens/pencils and other frequently used items."
3,its just ok,"I got this Jansport bag to replace a Columbia bag. It is a good size, but I'm finding the zippers are hard to open when I need to get in the bag. I find that I have to take the bag off and set it on the floor or something sturdy just to open a zipper. Wish it had thicker padding on the bag, and rounded corners. Its a very square bag. I'm finding it will take a while to break this bag in, unlike my Columbia."
5,Great backpack!,I purchased this backpack for my daughter to take to school. It is plenty big to hold all her books/homework as well as her lunch box. She loves it!
3,JanSport Backpack,"I ordered this backpack for my daughter who is entering high school. She needs a large one as her textbooks are very big. The description said it was College sized so I thought it would work. When we received it however, it was not any bigger than the average backpack. I ended up having to buy another one for her. It's a nice backpack just not college sized if you ask me."
5,Big Student Backpack,"I bought a Jansport Big Student backpack for my daughter for Christmas and she really loves it. It's much easier on her back than what she was using previously and it fits a lot of books. She wasn't thrilled when she opened it, but now that she's returned to school with it, she thanked us for giving to her."
4,Good backpacks.,Nothing spectacular. Does the job. Hasn't worn out or anything. Lots of space. Variety of colors was nice to choose from. Good Price.
1,No Madonna's Music in it !,"I love madonna, but this dvd is contains only people who around madonna. There is no madonna in it. it was waste of time..."
1,Utter Disappointment,"Being an unauthorized documentary, this DVD is just a bunch of interviews with people that know her or have worked with her, and even went to high school with her, repeating themselves over and over again. I learned nothing new about Madonna by watching this DVD. The sound quality was horrible and some of the camera work was disappointing. Of course since it is an unauthorized documentary, there are no Madonna songs being played as background music and certainly no concert footage. I thought there would be more rare photographs of Madonna. I do not recommend this item if you are a die-hard Madonna fan. I was bored the entire time and turned it off after 30 minutes. Such a disappointment. Sorry :-/"
1,Not Worth it,"I should have known that an unauthorized biography would be bad. Madonna's productions are flawless; this couldn't be more cheesy, down to the british accent on the narrator. Save your money."
5,"Better than her ""Best Of""","I bought Ms. Kidjo's ""Best of"" CD last year and I liked it quite a bit. However, I LOVE this CD! All of the songs are infectious and immediately memorable. I was in love by the end of the 2nd listening. The compositions are ""catchy"" and yet full of harmonic and rhythmic interest. The orchestration is perfect - nothing is overdone or overblown. Several traditional African instruments can be heard. Her voice is lovely. The compositions are about evenly divided between major-key/minor-key, and upbeat/slow-beat. This CD deserves very high praise and I certainly hope it earns her more recognition in the U.S. market. She certainly deserves it."
4,Angelique Does It Again!,"Each of Angelique's albums has its own personality, and this one is no exception. She has even said that her albums are like children to her. I find this album to be very listener-friendly. I find myself transported to Bahia, though I've never been there. ""Iemanja"" makes me think of a moonlit night stroll on the beach. I especially love the ballads, but ""Tumba,"" which is ""dedicated to the public,"" is sure to get you on your feet. I have seen Angelique live 4 times since 1998 and met her 2 weeks ago. I will say that after hearing the music live, the album has a few weak points, not as pumped up as it is performed live. But I would definitely recommend picking this up for your Kidjo collection. If you have never heard her music, I would also suggest you pick up Keep on Moving as an intro to her."
4,Infectious is the word!,"Someone donated this to a thrift store, unopened, and I am the lucky girl who found it for only a dollar! Well, I'm a happy girl, because all the songs are delightful...Ms. Kidjo has a lovely voice and well-suited to her Afro-Brazilian rhythms...Tumba, tumba, tumba!"
4,Wonderful album,"I preordered this CD because I like Angelique Kidjo's work so much. I've now listened to it twice and in my opinion it has a few truly standout songs: Bahia, Tumba, and Ces Petit Riens. However, it is not quite as ""up,"" ""danceable,"" or however your describe her earlier albums. This is a more mature sound somehow. I recommend it."
5,Practical guide to a complex subject,"This book provides a simple, practical, easy to understand approach to a potentially confusing subject. It quickly brings the reader to the point where they are able to design and run basic designed experiments. It provides enough statistical background to facilitate the basic understanding necessary for success without bogging the reader down with unnecessary theory."
1,Not for me,"A mass of facts and data hardly comprehensible with bad explanations and exampes, in my view."
2,Bad Design,I just bought a pair of the C5 12 x 42 and while the optics are clear great to look through while in a controlled environment they are not user friendly in the field. I went bowhunting with them for the first time and on the second day dust got in the twist up area of the eyecups just from setting them on my dusty pack a few times without the cover on and the next time I went to pull them up they were bound up from the dust. I tried twisting it up but the rubber covering on the eyecup slipped off and broke the plastic inside it. Now it comes off with the cover everytime I take it off. Another problem with them is I went to look at an elk the day before and had to pull the cover off twist up the awkward eyecups and pull the caps off the objective lens. The whole process took about 15 seconds and the elk caught me fiddling around with the binos. Not very easily used while in the moment. I am sending them back.
4,Country Music Chronicle,"Marty Stuart is country music's renaissance man. What a truly rare combination of talents: great voice, great picker, great songwriter, great photographer, and is keenly aware of the fact that he's had the good fortune of having stood among American icons.The photos in this book are excellent by any standards. I was expecting the photography to be so-so...generally when a talented person tries to branch out, it doen't translate to their new endeavor...but I have to say he's got an excellent eye. Not only that, but he can spin a yarn like a true poet, and that is what makes this such an all-around joy to both read and look at.Something to look for in this book: the story of going to see Connie Smith in concert as a boy and telling his mother ""I'm going to marry her one day""....and 27 years later, he did just that. Wait until you see the picture he took.This book captures an important piece of American history and does it well."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the worst product I have ever purchased. I'm beyond disappointed. I would give zero stars if I had the option. I vomited in this bag and it was only about 1/3 cup. After only a few seconds of holding the bag, the entire bottom opened up and the vomit ended up all over my lap and on my seat in the car. Unbelievable! What an embarassment! I had to take my pants off in the car and had to cancel my dinner plans because I didn't have a change of clothes. The ""one-way valve"" is total joke. The bag is not opaque as in the picture. It is completely transparent. This is advertised for vomit and urine. Imagine if someone were to use it for urine. They would have it all over them as well. The seller didn't pack a receipt in my order and there is no way I can return the rest of the bags I purchased. Amazon was only the middle man for this purchase. Don't trust BP Medical. They have my money and I have a totally worthless product."
2,Not as advertised,"Bought these and there is no inner- valve to prevent leaks. I've not had to use it, so don't know how sturdy it will be. You would have to throw it away immediately after using it or hold it upright in your lap, because it will definitely leak! It is also clear rather than opaque and there was no packing slip, either. I'm a little scared to try this product after reading the other review. Giving it two stars, because I haven't had to actually use it, yet."
4,"Great content, horrible organization","I generally like McClean as a writer and a teacher. This book is no exception in that he is a good sharer of ideas, full of pragmatic advice and interesting to read.The problem is the way this book is organized. It spends time talking about the setup for putt, pitch and chip in one chapter, then jumps to the basic stroke for all in the next. Then it gets to advanced ideas for all in the next and so on.So, every chapter is a little bit of salad, a little bit of steak and a little bit of dessert. It would've tasted a lot better in separate courses. After a while the jumpiness of the content is just not conducive to learning."
5,Mis Kudlatek is an imaginative cartoon and great for kids,"Mis Kudlatek Kolorowe Psoty (Curly Hair Teddy Bear: Colorful Mischief) is a collection of six cartoons and runs a little under and hour in all. Mis Kudlatek is a Polish cartoon that has dialogue, so a basic understanding of the language is needed, as there are no subtitles.The cartoon is about a teddy bear named Kudlatek. He can talk and even likes to eat honey. A girl named Agnieszka owns him. Agnieszka also has a dog named Waczatek; she has Waczatek keep an eye on Kudlatek because he is always getting into trouble. Kudlatek doesn't mean to cause mischief but is a little rascal so it happens naturally. Kudlatek does learn his lesson from his mistakes so it all works out in the end.The way Kudlatek talks and what he says is really funny. Kudlatek reminds me a little of the bear in the Wlatcy Moch movie. Mis Kudlatek is an imaginative cartoon and great for kids."
2,A Real Snoozer...,"I would never have watched this movie but I'm related to one of the main actors so it was for support. First of all, the movie was so poorly shot that I couldn't understand half of what was being said. The story was completely predictable & the acting was HORRIBLE! If you want a sweet story to watch, purchase Brokeback Mountain. Skip this snoozer."
1,Watch this only if threatened with your life,"This movie is low budget, bad acting, poor pretty much everything and overall annoying music. If someone threatens your life if you do not watch it, choose carefully."
5,A non-lisper's opinion,"Although I am mostly a C/C++ programmer, I still found this book to be an interesting read. If you, like me, have an interest in programming language design and implementation I highly recommend it. As other reviewers have noted, however, the book has little material for Lisp programmers who just want to use the MOP without looking under the hood. I don't consider this a shortcoming - understanding the design and implementation of your language and tools helps in using them effectively."
3,A Gentle Little Read,"Continuing my theme of reading books about libraries and librarians, I read How I Fell in Love with a Librarian today. The main character is a preacher who falls instantly in love with the town's new librarian. As the preacher gets to know the librarian better, however, he realizes she occasionally exhibits some odd behavior, including rhyming all her sentences.This is a very quick read. I would caution anyone intrigued by the title that this book is openly and unabashedly Christian and that thenovel's ending may strike some as too pat and too neatly wrapped up. For me, it was a gentle little read."
1,Silly waste of time,"This was a silly waste of time. From the other reviews, I expected something special, but it was poorly written and not worth my time at all! I'm only grateful it was only 101 pages long."
2,Strawberry Shortcake stamps,The stamps were purchased to add to the list of items for my daughters birthday in 2011. Although the item was a good value the same cannot be said of the delivery cost - very expensive.
4,Great Energizing Video!,"I love this video! It did take a couple of times to get the steps, but as soon as I did-I fell in love with it! It is so much fun! I have over 8o fitness videos and many of the aerobic ones become very similar after awhile. This one definitely works you, (once you get the steps down and can put energy into it) and it isn't repetious. It really does help burn fat and and tone your legs. The aerobics are designed to tone without forcing you to stop and do a bunch of repetions of lunges or squats. I would give it 5 stars if it had some kind of abdominal work. Even if they added some kind of kicks to the routine so that you could get an ab workout while just holding in your stomach. But overall-very worth the challenge of learning the routine. Stick with it! (by the way, I am not a dancer or particularily coodinated and it took two times to be able to actually work hard with this video-it's not as bad as it sounds from all of these reviews) Enjoy!"
3,It takes practice,"I got this vhs from a friend of mine who has two left feet when it comes to anything other than walking. I figured since I've always been a quick learner and love dancing, this would be no sweat. Well it was a lot of sweat and I felt like I was the one with two left feet! It took me several tries to get the foot-work (without the arms) and at one point I shelved the video out of frustration. But eventually I made up my mind to keep trying and that even though I couldn't get the hang of it right away, if I broke it down in segments eventually I'd get it. I mean, these instructors probably had a hard time getting it together, too. Once I learned the foot-work I was smiling cornily just like they were. Even my sister is in awe of my ability to keep up and hardly make any mistakes, and she's 11 years younger than me. It's a great workout once you get it. I would have given it five stars since I love it now, but that wouldn't be fair to all the people with two left feet."
5,This is the BEST dance video I have tried!,"I absolutely recommend this video to those who are willing to work hard and receive wonderful results while having LOTS of fun!! I have been dancing since the age of 2 and until now have not found a challenging and fun dance video! I LOVE the music and routines that this workout offers. You will need a lot of room and water. The first time through is difficult, but even if you stumble through on the first few tries, you will pick up more and more each time--and eventually become pro! The instructors keep you enthusiastic and working hard with a smile on your face!"
2,Several problems!,"First, you'll need a LOT of space...a LOT. Apparently, someone told these people we all have dance studios in our homes.Second, you'll need to watch and re-watch the segments to LEARN them before you're ever able to actually do them along with the tape. The instruction is fast, poor, and the add-ons come pretty quickly.Also, the quality of the tape is pretty bad...it looks like a copy of a copy of a copy. I can't believe I PAID for this junk.I'm sure that if you have the time or patience to learn the segments (rewind, watch, attempt, rewind again...) it is probably a lot of fun and fairly rewarding, but it'll take several viewings before most people get to this point.I'd say pass this one buy, or at least rent it at a video store before you committ to the purchase. Wish I had."
1,Buns of Steel:Total Body Fat Burner,"This video is not worth the ten bucks I paid.The video was only 30 minutes, but felt like an eternity. The moves were too jarring, and the choreography is uninspired. I found the instructors annoying. Of all the buns of steel videos, this is not the one to buy."
2,For those who like complicated dance step routines,"Being a great fan of Buns of Steel and working out often with their series of tapes, I was sure I would get a good workout with this Total Body Fat Burner. However, I was very disappointed with the routines on this tape. Even after several attempts, I find the steps much too complicated and in places almost impossible to follow. If you like complicated steps and fancy routines, then this is for you. If like me, you just want a simple-to-follow but effective workout, then you will be disappointed."
1,Felt like I had missed all the rehersals,"This video contained dance steps that were combined into very long multi-part patterns that are hard to learn. It feels like you are always several steps behind. New steps and patterns are added every few minutes, so you never get to repeat one action long enough to learn it. Several times I've thought that it would just be a lot easier to go outside and jog for a while in order to burn fat. So that's what I've started doing. I don't use this video any more. On the other hand, Michelle is very cute."
1,Are they professional dancers?!,"You have got to be kidding me with this ""workout"". It should have been titled, ""Fast-paced, complicated dance steps even for the advanced dancer""...it makes me wonder just how many months it must've taken for the instructor herself and her backups to get those steps down long enough to be taped. God bless Taebo!"
4,Not Bad for a Quick 30 Minutes of Cardio,"This video doesn't deserve the negative reviews posted here. It's led by Michelle Dozois who, in my experience, likes to throw in fast changing and complex foot work and doesn't have the best cueing. (I'm not a fan of Michelle). However, the music and the challenge of learning the steps motivate me enough to have fun with it. There is a point, about 2/3 through where it can get a bit frustrating, but overall, it's really not that hard to follow. I also add wrist-weights and high impact moves to make it more intense. Not that bad for a short cardio workout."
5,I actually love this video,"I used to do this video many years ago. I have since lost my copy and am on Amazon trying to buy it again. Yes, the choreography is difficult. But that is what I like about it! I get bored with simple videos with unchallenging routines. I had to do this workout several times to get the steps, but after that I loved it. To this day when I hear the songs from the video I can't help but think of the workout."
4,Do the job...,"Got these to avoid another power surge that blasted my computer. As far as I know, they are still doing their job. They look nice and having room for 4 larger plugs is great."
5,ten more please,"this is the best thing i've ever bought. i'd buy ten more of them right this minute if i could afford it. one at a time, i guess..."
4,Its nice... not great... but nice,"Not quite as useful as the bigger model, but it looks nice a slick and it dosn't stand out to bad. Its meant to be out in the open though so don't buy it if you have an entertainment center you want to stick it behind. Dosn't always fit."
3,Thought it had USB. Beware!,"I thought this one had USB ports also, I was mistaken. Very disappointing. These ethernet ports are useless in this context, and I wish this had been clearer. Such a disappointment.Design-wise, it does make some sense, although the base is probably too wide."
3,Defective,"Received this surge protector a few days ago. Sending it back since the ""Not Grounded"" light comes on through every outlet in my house. We have tested our outlets for bad wiring and every one reads just fine.From what I could tell it seems like its made from pretty flimsy material. Also the cord is much too long, but that can be a good thing depending on the location of your outlets. Im sure its a fine product if you get one that works."
1,DEFECTIVE PRODUCT!!,This is a BAD product-I purchased it in July and the red light came on several months after indicating the thing was not working properly for protection-the unit completely stopped this morning. A total waste of $$$ and I cannot return it unless I pay - it was supposed to have a long warranty but so much for that. Don't waste your money I will not again.
3,Missing adequate features and limitations,"Disappointed with what I received.I bought this to use a power distribution center for an aquarium. What's the first thing I see: Not suitable for aquariums. On the box and on the unit itself, but not on the website description.Also, there is no circuit breaker or on/off switch with this unit. First time I've seen one of these without a master power switch and a breaker."
4,Brought back lots of memories,"Previously had this on vinyl, finally getting around to buying the album on cd. I felt young again listening to the songs and plan to get lots of play out of it in the future."
4,They Defenitely Kept it up,This album is awsome. Slightly more of a pop sound than before but still a great album. The keyboards sound wonderful. I seen them in concert back in 1996 and they still rocked the house. Let's all get together and bring back good rock music!
3,Good advice for dog owners,This book has some great points on how to view things in your dogs point of view. Some of the stuff in the beginning is common knowledge but it does have some great advice that I find myself going back to and referencing often. I would recommend this book to dog owners that are having trouble with certain behavioral issues.
4,Very good starter book for new puppy owners,"I am very pleased with this book as it gives you very good information in all of the areas you need when you have a puppy. There's the right level of detail, and very specific instructions on training exercises you can do at home. All of it is done with good humor and lightness so it's not textbooky. It's also structured in a way so you can skip around and go right to a problem area if needed. Highly recommend this book."
5,An excellent adjunct to the Dog Whisperer,"With a brand new puppy, I needed training on training. Between this book and watching Dog Whisperer DVD's, I now have the perfect pup!"
2,Book might be OK if youve never owned a dog before,"However, if you are an experienced dog owner then forget it. This entire book merely expounds on the obvious and common sense solutions that we all know and have already tried. I was hoping for some new insights to common problems but no such luck."
3,Pretty Basic,"Make your dog your best friend and he will do what you want. That is the basic premise of the book. The theory is reward focused, using treats, gentle pats, etc., to condition the dog to behave.I have a ""rescue dog"" that was abused. He doesn't much like being touched. So far, he would rather go exploring that to mind me. The author suggests I am just not trying enough - possibly true. This book gave me a couple ideas, but hasn't been much help."
5,A useful book for dog owners,"This book helped me understand more on dog's behavior and personality through lots of good examples and theories, those are very useful for dog owners. The techniques and the positive reward method on training described in this book are reasonable and effective. But I think other than using the techniques on training my 5 months old overactive miniature pinscher, I also need lots of patient and time on him.I highly recommend this book and will keep it for reference."
5,An underated album,"I read a review in a guitar magazine that described this CD as brilliant and original, so I bought it, And it lived up to the hype....The liner notes say that Jerry Garcia played with Mishra after hearing this-I can see why-Mr.Garcia's taste was always impeccable and the spirit free-this CD has that. I also notethat Mr. Mishra immigrated to The US as an exceptional artist! Atleast the immigration service is not all bad!"
5,"For the price and quality, these brake pads can't be beat","I got these because they weren't as expensive as the EBC Yellowstuff and they had the most all around stats for the best price. I am highly satisfied and after I installed them there was a time when I had to brake hard to make a U-turn and these brakes really made my Mini Cooper stop FAST and also had no squeal or jerking at all. These were easy to install and feel a lot more powerful than the OEM MIni Cooper brakes. Everyone online, from the MiniUSA to North American Motoring forums claim that these are one of the best brakes out there. There is no wonder why so many people recommend them, and now I am confirming that.-Ken FlemmingAuthor, How to Get a Job in Video Games"
2,"Not great, but not terrible either...","I wanted a Karaoke/CD player for my little girl so she and I could sing together. It is definitely NOT worth the hefty price. The sound is okay, but the microphone doesn't work very well. I have to put my lips directly on the mic to hear anything at all. Don't waste your money."
5,Enthusiastically recommended reading for Civil War buffs,"Carrying The Flag by civil war historian and expert Gordon C. Rhea is the true story of Private Charles Whilden, an ordinary solider who served the Confederacy during the Civil War and whose courage was so great it would affect the tide of one of the war's greatest battles. An attention compelling, superbly detailed, informed and informative narrative that goes into especial detail concerning the bloody and deadly fights, as well as an intrinsically exciting read, Carrying The Flag is enthusiastically recommended reading for Civil War buffs and a welcome contribution to the growing library of American Civil War literature."
4,"Great book, however...","The lack of maps showing the actions Whilden was involved in makes it hard to follow the battles. The only two maps after the contents page are listed as THE WILDERNESS and SPOTSYLVANIA COURT HOUSE. They show roads,streams/ rivers, railroads, and well known landmarks like the Widow Tapp's Field and the Mule Shoe among others. Unless you are well versed in these battles and know the area it makes for confusing reading. A few maps showing the positions of both armies at critical moments would have made the situations they were in clearer and easier to visualize. ~G"
4,"Great for buffs, and raises questions...","For anyone wanting to learn the specifics of two major battles between Grant and Lee, this book is excellent. I am always glad to see books that resist glorification by detailing the horrendous conditions of some of the most brutal fighting of the war, which is saying a lot. SPOILER--But the author couldn't resist talking about Whilden's actions as heroic and how the day was won for the Confederacy as if it were a truly noble outcome. Now look at it another way: if Whildon were shot down and the Rebels didn't have a rallying point to successfully rienforce the earthworks, then Grant would've plowed through, cutting Lee's army in half and most likely defeat them. With this outcome, you would not have had the endless series of massacres throughout central Virginia, no siege of Petersburg, no Cold Harbor. With the war over, you probably wouldn't have Atlanta and Colombia in ashes and the atrocity of Sherman's March. Just food for thought-Discuss..."
3,Civil War,"The story is about an individual and his role, but this was not elevated much above basic info and not personal. It was generally a recap of several majorbattles of the War of Northern Aggresion."
1,Horrible,"I bought one of these out of desperation. I was away from home, had a quick minor project I wanted to accomplish and since I have a very nice saw and miter box in my shop, I did not want to spend a lot of money. Big mistake!About the only way I can describe this thing, and be lady like about it, is ""a hunk of junk!""Like the other reviewer here, I found this thing was good for about three or four cuts, it then eats the plastic it is made from and after that it is simply impossible to make a good and accurate cut. I personally did not find the saw to be of very good quality.To be honest, I could have done the whole project better just using my eyes.I threw the thing away."
1,Wears out quick!,"I bought this product a while ago, and had used it originally for cutting a few minor pieces of decorative trim (worked fine). I decided to use it to start making my first workbench (made out of 2x4's). The first 4 or so cuts went well - but then after that the saw ate away too much of the plastic, and my future cuts came out crooked."
1,Piece of Junk,I agree with the other reviews.Tried to cut wood and the saw went right through the plastic box.Not worth the aggravation!!
4,A Good Pair of Utility Gloves,"I bought these gloves to wear while working. I have to carry keys and other work related instruments that other people carry from previous shifts. These gloves act as a good barrier. I use them for the same reasons medical personnel wear latex gloves. However, since I don't work in the health care field, latex gloves are out of place. These gloves are a good alternative. They are kind of big, so it is very difficult to type on the computer while wearing these gloves."
5,Nice Pre-school / Kindergarten clothing protection,Inexpensive and much better protection than dad's old shirt. Heavy clear/printed vinyl. Concerns about fit listed in ratings did not hold true. Purchased for use in pre-k class and apron has lots of growing room & could be likely be used for several more years. Nice velcro closures make apron easy for child and teacher.
1,not worth it,"Harder to get into than I first thought. The kids are anxious to get to ""work"" and fidget getting into this, the arms are a bit too tight. It seems bulky as well. Better off going old school - daddy's old shirt on backwards!"
1,apron,"I didnt care for this item to much, the sleeves were to tight, and they are plastic, which made it very uncomfortable for my 7 year old to wear."
1,Cute but sticky paint apron,This painting smock is cute and nicely sized but my grandaughter wasn't comfortalble with the plastic/vinyl. Perhaps it could have been better with a liner.
3,Too large,"This was purchased for my 2 year old so he could marker on our easel. This was way too big for him and fit my 5 year old much better. Also, the plastic seems to be quite stiff. My 5 year old doesn't really like wearing this and prefers to wear one of Daddy's old shirts with the neck safety-pinned, so this apron hasn't received much action."
3,For artists with short attention spans,"Great coverage but lack of side vents (or some other additional airflow somewhere besides the back opening) makes it ""sticky hot"" if worn more than about 5 minutes at a time."
4,Art Smock,I purchased this for my granddaughter to use at my house when painting or washing dishes. It is way too big for her and I will save it until she is 5 or 6 years old. The design did not allow for any minor modification to fit her at age 2 1/2.
4,No mess no fuss!,"I love this art apron my my 6 year-old son! This is one of the few aprons I found that is for his age group/size, is plastic, & is long-sleeved. Since it's long sleeved I don't have to worry about what he's wearing underneath. And he loves the big pockets on the front. It's super easy to clean as well! It's easy enough for him to put on (he does have a little trouble making the velcro at the top behind his neck/shoulder stick properly sometimes) so he can just use it whenever he wants without having to come to me to get him in & out of it. It makes life easier for both if us!"
1,Nice book---with $1 pricetag from a thrift shop still on it.,Talk about 120 percent profit. I wanted to cry when I bought this thinking it was new to give to my girlfriend for a gift and it was a thrift shop dirty book. yikes
5,Golden voice of The Beach Boys,"The first of only two solo albums recorded by Carl Wilson. Never on CD and out of print for over twenty years. ""Heaven"", and ""Hold Me"" are standout tracks which feature Carl's silky vocals. Carl was fed up with The Beach Boys becomming an oldies act when he made this record and if some of the lyrics are a bit weak the enthusiasm and soulfulness exhibited here make his untimely death all the more tragic. Get a copy if you can find it!"
5,"It will make you laugh, it will make you cry,..","One word for this brilliant masterpiece - WOW. I find myself reading about 75% of a book and then beginning the next. Problem is, I can usually predict the end and find it unnecessary to read the rest. I can honestly say that I read this book from cover to cover in 3 days, barely able to put it down. The ""matter-of-fact"" feeling and it's smooth flow made me want to keep going. Rhonda has been blessed with the ability to capture you into the world of this growing adolescent young lady as if it is your own life. Memories, ideas, and the confusions about the world and the people in it were shared, leading me to reevaluate my own growing experiences. I would recommend this book to anybody and everybody as it contains all of the essentials of a good book,.. humor, emotion, and reality.Rhonda, please publish another book soon, I can't wait. Seriously."
2,Did anyone proofread this?,"I didn't care for the hurried ending. The biggest disappointment was the multitude of grammatical, spelling, and chronological errors, though. One of the characters names changes from Lara to Lynn and then back again. Another character is referred to by name before you ever learn what his name is.In addition, there are only 2-3 good people in the book. Apparently, the ratio of pedophiles to normal people must be much higher than we think. It just wasn't believable.It could have been good with some serious editing and more attention to detail, though, as it was a great idea and story line."
3,This book was ok,"This was a good book until the end. The ending was terrible, you get through the whole story and there is no ending. Very disappointing."
2,Not so good,I wanted to like this book but I just can't. The story Isn't even holding my interest long enough to finish the book.
1,Just ok,Book was ok. Rate it a three. Read worst but sure read better. Wasn't real interesting. Boring story line throughout. Glad it was free.
2,"Introduction to the concepts, not a good workout","I have been practicing pilates at a Stott studio and though I'm a big fan of Stott Pilates, this and there other beginner tapes are disappointing. It's useful if all you want is information on the pilates concepts, but I don't see how anyone can get a good workout from them. The level 2 tapes, and up, are all very good and guarantee a good workout. If you don't know anything about pilates, such as imprinting, neutral spine position, and correct breathing, this is a good tape."
1,I haven't receive the package,I haven't receive the package so how im going to write about it. i need information about what happend with it
4,"Kind of like ""too close for comfort"" only with a bit more character depth!","If you were a fan of the TV series ""too close for comfort"" you will probably enjoy this series as well. Like ""comfort"" the plot revolves mostly around a father and his two daughters. In this case though the daughters (played by Dinah Manoff and Kristy McNichol) have come back home after striking out in life. We get to see a bit more depth at times regarding the lives of the characters and things sometimes get fairly dramatic for a comedy. The series began to falter after a few seasons but the first couple were great!This is a very good comedy and deserves to be released on DVD."
5,What a dissapointment,It's such a travisty that this show has never yet been considered for release on DVD Come on Buena Vista we want our Empty Nest !!
5,Bring this to DVD!,They need to bring this to dvd!! Anything Susan Harris does is great! They have been putting it on from time to time on Hallmark channel. Hurry and bring the golden palace on dvd soon too!!! I will be the first to buy both!!
5,Great Show! Loved Watching It,"My mom and I used to watch this show every Saturday. If I remember correctly, it used to come on after the Golden Girls. We watched them both. Anytime I think of great sitcoms, this show along with the Golden Girls and a few others, always pop up in my mind. I really wish that this would be released on DVD soon. There are other shows on DVD that I am surprised made it to DVD before this. Please put this on DVD soon."
5,Things get pushed on you but what you ask for doesn't get offered,"I have to agree that so many good sitcoms that could be sold and I am sure people would want to buy are not offered, but yet, we have all the seasons of new tv shows coming out even though they have been cancelled after the first season. It is a shame that classics are hidden from us. I came to this country 19 years ago and partly learned a language based on classic sitcoms such as Empty Nest, Golden Girls and Cosby Show. I hope that things change and in our big commercial world there are some young kid whose grandmother wants to watch Empty Nest or Moude and we get lucky because this kid has some pull when it comes what to release and what not."
5,Bring it back!,I loved this show. It would be fun to be able to see it again since most of the shows on TV now are so awful. Please bring it out on DVD--SOON!
3,Will not charge fully,This item will not fully charge and/or the charging light does not work. I contacted the company and they sent me a new battery but the unit still does not fully charge.
5,Excellent Charger,I have had this for a little over a year now and it works great. I used it several times when my battery died on my car. Also works pretty good as an air pump. I leave it plugged in charging in my garage so it is always ready.
4,Delivery Snafu,"I bought this unit for myself, and liked it so well that I gave it as a gift to my brother-inlaw. After over 4 weeks, it still hasn't shipped, even though it still shows a available in less than 24 hours on Amazon. Ever try to CALL Amazon to discuss issues? Beware."
1,Couldn't get the door to close after 2 months,"When I bought this it worked great. I used it for bed and breakfast guests and the cleaning staff for two months. A couple of days ago I had to remove it from the gate temporarily. When I tried to set it up again, the key door wouldn't close. I think the spring inside the key area that allows the handle closure to lock got stuck when I removed it and began blocking the key door. Considering it was the very first time I had tried to take the thing off the gate and put it back, that's not very reliable. I'll be trying something else."
2,"Looks sturdy, but only worked for 2 weeks. :(","Although this Master Lock appears to be well made, after about two weeks of daily use the first digit in the combo became stripped and the lockbox would not open. Had to take the door knob off, denting it in the process. I've decided to purchase the GE/ Supra KeySafe this time. Hope others have better luck with it."
3,Great product/ won't fit most modern car keys,"I purchased this product so I could stash my car key when I go surfing. It's a very sturdy lock and works well, however the design doesn't allow you to stash a car key with a remote. I have a 2006 range rover, and the door to the lock won't shut all the way. My key isn't that big. I didn't test any other types of car keys but I'm assuming it will only fit a flat key. I guess you could use a valet key and lock your main key in the car. However some modern cars don't allow you to lock your key inside your car.The product is well made and sturdy but i gave it 3 stars because its not very versatile. The locking mechanism i so thick that when you close the door, there is very little room inside the box. Use it for house keys. Or older car keys with out remotes. I hope this helps someone."
5,Great lock,It is a perfect lock because you can save your keys into it.I have bougth many of them for my personal use
2,It was always hard to use and failed on me,"This unit looks good, but the dial and release lever was always hard to use. I used it about 10 times and it finally stopped working. I could not get it to close. The mechanism locked. There were two screws to open the mechanism which I removed easily, but still could not get the cover off of the mechanism. From the time I purchased the product til now I've not been happy with it. I've used other types and prefer the push button type. I believe it's more dependable."
4,Very sturdy and handy for even the most obscure jobs...,"""Master Lock 5400D Select Access Key Storage Box with Set-Your-Own Combination Lock"" is something that you really cant find in most stores just laying around next to other locks. This is actually a nice semi-rare buy on the internet that really can be applied to anything your imagination can put its use for. Keys, useful trinkets and pretty much anything that can fit in there (see product description). The dual ""U"" lock and combination dials make it really easy to use. Nice product. Sturdy and strong."
5,Key Lock Box,"Extremely easy to use, so easy a child (yes, even a Republican) could setthe combination. This is a heavy, solidly built unit, and I would recommentit for anyone needing to 'hide' a key in plain sight, in this case foremergency personnel. Hasp is plastic coated for protection of the finsihon the door knob from which it is hung.Unit shipped within 1 day of order, and arrived within 6 days. Package isheavy blister pack - have good shears available."
2,Undependable,"Ordered five last November for use at commercial property leasing vacancies. Within 8 months, two of them were unopenable. They seemed to just jam up. The lever would not slide down after entering the combination. I decided to give them one more try, and order two more of the same. When I was setting my own combination on the new ones, only one would open using the preset factory combination. I am returning it, and will not order any of these ever again."
4,No more leaving the key under the mat,"We got one of these to use for our cleaning service. We used to literally leave the key under the mat...crazy eh? But this works really well and we now feel much more comfortable about leaving the key out. The only thing I don't like about it is that the dials are a little small for people with big fingers...other than that, great!"
4,I'm confused by all the bad reviews on this product,"Like i said I'm a bit confused by all these bad reviews. I have sold real estate for six years an have used several different types of lockboxes an this being the easiest for all sorts of people to use. I have never had a issue with them sticking except for winter months where they get cold of possible have ice inside. I have 30 of these boxes an I even put these on the properties I manage an tenants can also easily gane access with ^no issues.They are not water tight as above review stated, when I have put them onn homes that have ^no cover above door an they are on there for long period of time they do rust a bit in side.I would recommend to anyone realtors, property managers an investors."
1,Got stuck and MasterLock didn't care,"A big shrug from MasterLock, they kept insisting that I had accidentally reset the combo-- NOT EASY TO DO! The black switch on the left would go down when I had the code in (wouldn't for different combinations) but the door wouldn't open to release the key! I called MasterLock and they said if I could get the lock off the door and mail it to them and they decided it was malfunctioning, they would return my money. I was like WHAAA? I had my landlord saw it open with a steel cutter to get my key out-- I don't have time to wait around for my only key!"
1,Pass on this lock box,"I was one of the unfortunate ones who had the box lock up on me. I set the combination and tried it several times. I then gave a demo to my wife and babysitter, so I verified the combination at least 5 times. I locked the box near our back door. The next day I tried to open it and it failed to open. There was no opening it. Fifteen minutes with a hacksaw and then a few squeezes from a big vice and I had my $30 Medeco key back. That created a whole other security concern for me. A 14 volt battery powered sawzall would go through this in 10 seconds. With a big hammer, or a moderately sized vice, a thief could have your key in a minute or less with this or any other lock box. I know real estate offices need these things but if you're just a home owner hoping to avoid locking yourself out, I'd consider putting a key in a zip lock bag and burying it somewhere in your garden. It's cheaper, and probably safer too."
4,VERY USEFULL,"Very usefull if you go alone to the beach. Just attach it to any hook of your car, or even at the handle of the door, and store your car key inside. Not rated 5 star because sometimes it is hard to close. But I would recommend it to a friend."
1,Cannot Open Item,"At first I thought I had lost my mind, or that perhaps someone punked me and changed the combination, because the thing will not open to the combination i set. I wrote it down right away, so there's no confusion, but after reading several reviews it seems like this has happened before. I am mad at myself for not reading all the reviews first!"
4,Good product,Reliable and works well.good price.will need to make sure it weathers well.Easy to reset comboPlenty of room for keys
2,Very Secure...it doesn't open,"We hired a caregiver for my dad and didn't want to just give them a key. Bought this because of the high amount of positive ratings. The storage box is VERY durable and strong. It was easy to set the combination. I tried it several times, it worked great. Then we put the key in,closed the door and tried the combination, but the box wouldn't open. We removed the key chain from the key, thinking maybe it was taking up room (it wasn't a big chain) and just put the key in. It wouldn't open. This was a normal sized house door key, not some jumbo key and there was only one (the description says it will hold 5 keys). The lever to open the door would move, indicating that the right combination was used, but the door wouldn't open. Can't take a chance of having the caregiver standing outside the locked door trying to get in...this is being returned."
5,Solid lock,We bought this to use outside our house. It's held up wonderfully in cold air/rain storms. Would definitely recommend.
5,The best purchase!,"We are so glad that we found this key storage box. It has allowed our guest to get the key and enter our house even when we are not at home! Unlike some reviewer's experience, we did not have any issues with the lock sticking in the cold. We also love the change combination feature. It allows us to change the combination after our guest has departed. We highly recommend this product. It sure beats putting a key under a rock!"
3,Compartment too small,"I use this to stow may car keys while running. Unfortunately, half the compartment is filled by the locking mechanism so I can't fit the key and remote fob together. I end up removing the one or the other from to use the case. On the up side, it is very secure and I don't fear any one breaking it open to take the keys. I considered the smaller unit with the cable loop but determined that was too easy to cut. At least this one is secure, if not very big inside."
5,Works great,Was easy to initially set up. The directions are very clear in my opinion. Will definitely purchase one of these in the future.
2,Holden Commodore keys do not fit in compartment,I purchased this to hold my car keys while surfing.Nice quality but the compartment not large enough for my VS Holden Commodore car key.Item returned.
2,Masterlock 5400d,"As far as I know, the product works well mechanically. Time will tell since I am using it in a coastal area that is open air but not exposed to rain, etc. I was disappointed that the product had scratches on it. It was supposed to be new."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THESE LOCK BOXES!!!!!!,We started using these locks at all of our vacant properties. I have had four of them quit working and have not been able to open them. The first one actually wouldn't open until about the 5th or 6th try and suddenly it worked. The second one I have we were never able to open and we had to remove the door knob to get the lock off the home. This makes us look pretty bad in front of our clients when we can't get into a home. It is not a wrong combination problem as the first lock opened after I spun the numbers back and forth and tried it 5-6 times. Then it opened on the right combination!DO NOT PURCHASE THESE LOCKS!!!!!!!!!I have been in contact with Master Lock and they basically say it's almost always somebody forgetting the code. I started buying the push button locks and have had great luck with them.
1,Jammed shut after 2 months,"I had owned the lockbox for 2 months, used it 15 - 20 times, and then the black piece that you slide down to open it jammed up. The numbers could still turn but the black piece wouldn't move. Called Master Lock and they said to call a locksmith."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"I have bought two of these, and both lock boxes failed within about a year's time. One will not open, and the other will not close. I use them to store my spare house keys in case I get locked out, so they rarely get used, and yet they still fail. In case you are wondering, I hang them on an interior door (I own a condo), so they are NOT exposed to the weather."
1,Not very secure.,"When we moved into the house we live in, one of these were attached to the back door, by a previous owner. I was tempted to cut it off as we didnot know the combination. One day I decided to see if I could get it off in a nondestructive manor. My first attempt was by disassembling the door knob. This only got it off the door. I fiddled with it for about an hour until I couldn't believe my eyes! It opened! Using nothing but simple everyday household items, I was able to discover the combination. After doing it a few times, I could do it in less than two minutes.If I can do it, I'm fairly certain anybody could do it. Beware that these things are not very secure. I laughed when I read about the lengths that others went through to ""crack"" theirs open.For those curious, the combination was 5408. Currently it is 0000 sitting in our living room as a conversation peice."
4,"Works very well, just don't expect it to last forever","I am a commercial property manager and buy these all the time. I haven't had a problem with one yet, I think we've used 10 or so, so far. We'll use them for realtors to show vacant spaces. They last for about a year and then we replace them as they start to become worn, and difficult to open. But for the price, generally $20-$22, it's a good investment once a year. They are easy to change the code, as well. Truly, they've worked very well and we'll continue to buy this product."
4,Used for Real Estate,"Bought a dozen of these for use on real estate listings. Had purchased these locally in the past and liked them. The ones I bought here were the cheapest price around. The units are now made in China, original ones were USA and are a lighter alloy material. Units still work and function fine for what we use them for and are better then other combo box options. I like the fact that the cover slides down over the combo and that keeps out ice and snow in our area."
4,Is not large enough for my car key fob,"I had to return this because my car key doesn't fit inside it. My key is a keyless electronic key fob; it came with my 2007 Volkswagen Passat. I was able to get the key inside the lock (just barely), but the lock wasn't able to close securely. So, if you have that key fob, don't buy this lock!Seems like a nice lock, otherwise."
1,DO NOT BUY - WON'T OPEN!!!,"I should've listened to negative reviews, but I figured those people were just dummies. Well the lock worked fine during 2 test combination changes. Then I decided to use it for real, and after setting new combination, releasing the latch, and closing, it would no longer open. The previous 2 combinations didn't work either. I even tried neighboring numbers just in case they were on the edge, still nothing. That's twenty bucks down the drain, now off to get a hammer to smash the damn thing open so I can get my spare keys."
1,"Can't open it, less than a year...",I purchased this November of 2011 and now it stopped working. I can't open it and it don't seem like a key is jammed inside because I can hear the key inside moving down when I turn it upside down. Is it cover with warranty? What to do here?
5,Works great !!!,"I used the lock box for contractors who were doing different tasks at a townhome like painting, carpet cleaning,flooring cleaning etc. They could use the combination to get the door key without me driving 55 miles roundtrip to let them in. The key also remains secure in a strong lock.Thankx Amazon !!! you saved me time and gas..."
4,"Works Great, a Little Under-Sized",The lock box works great. It appears to be well built and the mechanisms seem to work well and appear durable. My only issue is that the box is not large enough to hold a standard sized key card (credit card sized) as I had hoped for.
3,Not Good for Modern Car Keys or Surfing,"I bought this with the intent of using it for my car key when going surfing.Locking the car key in this lock and attaching to car.Although the lock is just as advertised, the interior compartment of the lock is not large enough to fit or contain most modern car keys (Honda CRV key, Honda Pilot Key).So if you are buying for similar purpose I would pass.I still haven't found a lock big enough.Thanks."
4,one thing missing,"I really like this product, but there is one problem with it. We use it for a vacation rental so that our renters can get their key upon arrival on the door nob. The problem is that it is too easy for the renter to change the combination or take the lock itself since it can easily be removed with a flip of a button. Hopefully this won't happen."
4,Great Lockbox! Several uses...,"These are great! They are easy to change the codes... They are big enought to hold several keys (and other stuff too)... They hook onto just about anything besides a door handle... hose bib, garage door handle, gate, even a trailer hitch!The only real downfall is that if they are out in the rain too much, have your WD40 handy, becaue they get hard to open!Also, if someone besides you changes the code and forgets (or you forget) then pitch it, 'cause you can never get it open (unless you use a hammer)... and you loose whatever keys you had inside... so don't put the only copy of a key in there!"
4,Master Lock for car key,"I live in Sydney Australia. I needed a solution for securing my car key when I go surfing. My son, who lives in Hawaii, pointed me to the Master Lock 5400D. I ordered it from Amazon.com and received it within two weeks. It is great, I can now secure the remote control for my car while going for a surf"
4,Good quality,The product works as expected. Easy to figure out how to change the combinations. I would recommend this to anyone.
4,Works well,"Bought this so I could store my car key in it while at the beach. Does the job.This tumbler style device is tougher to crack open than the push button style. This has 9999 combinations a thief would have to work through to open it. With the push button style, not sure how many combinations they have, but since you can only use each number once, it would seem to be fewer. If you use a push button combo, you may think a number like 7152 is high enough to be secure. But a thief would only have to get to 1257 to defeat the lock.Another thing, this is half the price that I've seen in stores."
4,Consistant French Vanilla pudding every time,"Jell-o brand pudding is a quick and easy to make product. Follow the directions on the box and you will have a consistent pudding every time. I find vanilla in general to be a bit plain on its own. However vanilla puddings can easily be used in a multitude of desserts. Use the pudding between layers of a layer cake, add the pudding to cake batter for a moister cake, or use in trifles. Homemade pudding is always the best, but when time or skill is lacking, this product is an excellent alternative.PROS:Easy and quick to prepareConsistent pudding every timeVersatile product for use in many dessertsCONS:It's a mix (But who regularly makes homemade pudding these days?)"
4,Similar to other Nirvana sheet music,"The MTV Unplugged contains all songs performed on MTV. I have rated it 4 stars only cos' the stars are bright and this album can't shine for Nirvana alone. Tablature edition for first guitar and vocals which is great. Far away from Nirvana in my opinion as long as the performance is concerned (Nirvana was a grunge band) but I must hold on to the review and I claim noone should be dissapointed in this edition. I checked all songs and every single note I was after, was it vocals or guitar a few times seemed to be tabbed correct. The lyrics are also well copied. If you don't play in a band you should go after this edition. It is a Nirvana MTV standalone performers' choice."
1,Wrong Size,"This ring is a 14 gauge ring. I'd ordered it because a search for bioplast eyebrow rings brought this item up, however when I recieved it, the package said 14 gauge."
2,Phoenix Macro lens,"This lens works if you have a lot of time to spend trying to make it work. It is supposed to be customized for my Canon 5D but the threads are so tight it takes several minutes to get it to screw on. The auto focus synch with my camera is not very fast or efficient. I always have to use manual. The lens itself makes quite a bit of noise when it focuses. It is not smooth by any means. I know I did not pay a huge sum for this lens, but I was hoping it would get me by until I could afford a better one. It does not get me by at all. I wish I had saved the money towrds a real lens."
3,XBOX 360 Outfit,"The game is great for teens. There is strategy involved and the game play is simple. I would not recommend this game for adults. The difficulty level is easy, however, the story line I thought was good."
3,Disappointed,"The game itself is OKAY, however, after playing COD on XBOX360, I was very disappointed. After playing for hours and getting far in the game, I wasn't able to save the game I just played, and had to start all over. As a serious gamer, I can live with the glitches in the graphics etc, but not to be able to save a game when I got so far, is very disappointing.I wish I had just rented the game first and not spent the $60.00."
2,"Not bad, but no Call of Duty","I was expecting something like Call of Duty except not in first person shooter mode. I was disapppointed to say rhe least. It is cool because you can take over vehicle and call in vehicles, but the controls are hard to get used to, and it is funt the first twon hours and then it becomes repetitive and lifeless."
3,"""Another WWII Shooter""","The Outfit is OK but i`ve seen MUCH better-the fact that it uses squads doesn`t mean its original either-""Brothers In Arms"" beat it there.But it is not the usual ""dark"" WWII game its very colorful and its explosive fun.Oh yeah...it is just another WWII shooter:)"
2,The Outfit,"Bought & played the game after Call of Duty on the 360. I found the outfit to be pretty disappointing and would not recommend it after playing COD.I have not played it on XBox Live, so I cant speak to some of the other reviews that focused on this aspect of the game."
4,Nice,This is a very roomy bag. It has places for you to safely store your memory cards or extra batteries. Overall it is a fairly functional camera bag.
1,"Turgid, dreadful","Please don't waste your money on this. This book consists of nothing more than recycled pseudo-marxist nonsense proclaiming the end of capitalism and the victory of the proletariat - which would be fine with me, but the authors offer no startling insights or fresh perspectives whatsover."
5,Good for Baby Stella,"Granddaughter loved it for Baby Stella. She has had it for a while, but still finds time to play with it."
5,Good Buy,I bought this to go with the Stella Doll I gave my 18 month old granddaughter for Christmas. She knew exactly what foods the softpillow like items were. They are beautifully made and easy for a small child to handle.
3,Magnetic bottle works great,My daughter enjoys feeding Baby Stella using this set. The weighted cereal bowl sits upright very well. I like the Velcro on the peas jar because it reminds her of how I open up jars. The bib is a bit tight and the Velcro could be a bit larger but still fits and the spoon is a perfect size both in relation to my daughter's hand and also the food from this set.
5,So cute!,These accessories for the baby stella doll are adorable! The bottle has a little magnet in it to cling to baby's mouth. The peas have a velcro lid. Each piece is so cute and soft!
4,Surprisingly Entertaining,"I did not expect my kids to enjoy playing with anything other than the ""cool magnetic bottle"" in this set, and perhaps the bib, but to my surprise, they have a lot of fun using the spoon and cereal bowl and peas with other dolls and pretending with each other."
5,Love Baby Stella Products,I bought these accessories to go with a Baby Stella Doll I had purchased. They are very well made. They promote role play for children. The bottle has a magnet in the tip and sticks to Baby Stella's mouth. Everything can be put in the washer and dryer. I HIGHLY recommend any Baby Stella Products for young children as there are no small pieces to choke on and everything is soft. LOVE THEM ALL!!!
4,perfect addition to baby stella,"My 15m daughter received this feeding set for Christmas, to go along with her baby stella. She loves how the bottle attaches to the doll with the magnet and feeds her baby all the time. I like how durable the stitches are, machine washable, and that the magnets are deep and secure inside the toys. Perfect 1st accessory for Baby Stella!"
4,The magnetic bottle is the best part!,"I purchased the feeding set, to go along with Baby Stella, for my daughter's 3rd birthday. She has played with all parts of the set, but the bottle is her favorite. She loves the way it sticks to the baby's mouth. The gift was a big hit."
3,Neat idea...,"I thought this would be a good gift for my daughter's 2nd birthday and she is just not that interested in it. She likes the bottle the best because it does the same thing that pacifier does. I agree with a previous reviewer who stated they would like to have more magnetic items. These are somewhat bulky and they don't fit into any of her kid sized diaper bags so they are usually all over the place. I am hoping maybe as she gets older she will appreciate the whole set more. She does play with her Stella doll often. In the end I would recommend smaller items, more magnets and maybe a bag to keep it all in. As for educational purposes Stella and her side items have been useful for modeling."
2,Not worth the money,"We have the stella doll which is cute. Like another reviewer said, the bottle w/ magnet is the only worthwhile piece in this set. Otherwise get out a plastic spoon, cup, and real infant bib and you'll give your child the same experience. Definately not worth the money."
5,Unbelievable ~ flies are fighting to get inside!,"I am purchasing one of these Trap-n-Toss units after watching one in action recently. We were at the lake and a little hamburger stand had so many flies swarming around that, at first, we were reluctant to place an order. But we quickly noticed that they weren't interested in the wonderful smell coming from the hamburger stand - instead, they were all trying to get inside the Trap N Toss container. We sat there for a couple of minutes (yes, it sounds sick) watching those flies urgently trying to be the next one in line to get inside. We are RV'ers and I'm buying one for us and one for my son's RV. Some people say there is an odor but I'm planning to place it a distance away from us. This brand is see-through, so the squeamish might want to find one that isn't see-through."
1,"good design, but didn't catch flies","Don't know why, but no flies were attracted to the bait. none went in! ended up using old fashioned flypaper, which caught tons of flies (also my hair once, gross)"
5,Great for my application!,I used this battery to replace a 4Ah battery in my sons power wheele. This battery works great! Holds a charge much longer then the original battery.
4,"another great ""chick"" read!","A great, light, entertaining, humourous read. A class above most ""girly"" reads. Well done Maggie Alderson!"
5,Fantastic,This was a truly fantastic book. I couldn't put it down. There is now a huge queue for it with my friends. I highly recommend it along with her other book Mad About The Boy.
1,Gauze roll bandages,"When I saw this ad,I had no idea that the package would contain ONE roll!At six bucks a pop,that price is outrageous!I usually order from other sources the same quality bandage and get an entire box for that price.They got me good.Never again!"
3,Faries?,"This book was entertaining, but not the best. When I picked it out, I had thought that it would be a historical fiction book, but after I started reading for a while, I found out that it wasn't really. Towards the middle/end, the plot started to bring in ""fairies/the wee folk."" I know that this book was based on two ballads, but I still think this book would have been better if the fairies were left out and just the belief of them remained."
4,My grade: A!,"An earthly knight is a wonderfully written book. It is about a lady who is more free than most ladys (who are the daughters of minor dukes). Almost ignored by the wealthy because it was her older sister who was a prominant member of society, that is, untill she is ""led astray."" Suddenly, the burden transfers from the older daughter, Isabelle, to the younger, Jeanette. Can she stand ""pure"" for the earl? Or will she find true love??"
3,What happened later?,"It was a good book, but it kinda leaves yo hanging! My question is, What happened to Adele? If anyone knows, which is doubtful, tell me! Or if you even have a guess.The author just ends, by only talking about Jenny. It was just confusing.Other than that, I would rate it a three! So, bye!"
1,Poor Quality and Very Boring,"I was very unhappy with the quality of this DVD. Not only was the audio bad, but the content was very boring. I could not even sit throught the entire video, nor could my 2 kids. I have been teaching fire prevention for 11 years and I would be embarrased to show this video to anyone."
5,Dale Earnhardt Collector's Value Guide,"Dale Earnhardt Collector's Value Guide (Collector's Value Guides)GREAT BOOK,and fast shipping. This is what I have been looking for to put a dollar value on my Dale Earnhardt diecast collection."
1,Down the Hole,I didn't like this movie.Barely made it through this.Silly acting and plain outboring.I wouldn't watch it again andthis movie isn't worth buying.
3,SAME OLD!,"Whos to say that nobodyfaced there fears or even drawn out a conclusion to where lifes really takes them.lets face it we all grasp at the fact that we would wanna accomplish things in our life so we can be proud of that.this movie goes in that direction,mick garris directs a soft approach of where life takes us and the choices we make.the only problem is the movie was slated as a horror movie but really its wasnt spooky.dont get me wrong it was interesting and kept my presence to see how the characters develop but like only one can tell a story.i wish they brought in erika christensen more and explain more into his life.overall a subpar flick that really is not what you think it will be about.i give this movie a 3/5 subparpysche flick that doesnt dwell in the characters like its supposed to."
3,Riding the Bullet,"It was a good movie. I personaly would have liked it to have been scarier in my opinion and a little better movie, but I liked it thank you."
3,Riding the bullet,"This movie started getting semi interesting when David Arquette came on. Sadly, that was almost an hour in and he couldn't save it. I was so bored I kept falling asleep and it wasn't the casts fault, the movie was simply not interesting enough to keep my attention."
3,an ok movie,"maybe a rental, but its just ""O.K."" It makes you think, but it will not stay with you. Tends to get repetitive too."
4,Psychological thriller!,King does it again. He takes an everyday occurence and turns it into a frightening mind game. Imagine having to choose between dying or losing your mother. A must see for all die-hard King fans!
4,WILD RIDE,"This is one wild and crazy, mixed up ride. Nearly undescribable, yet totally watchable and enjoyable. The plot(which I won't go into very far, others have done such a fine job)is simple, the atmosphere surreal. A concept that works better on paper than on film. Mick Garris does an expert job with the transformation, mixing abstract ideas with real life adventure and emotions. It has it's truly scary moments intertwined with human emotion and humor. One of the best Stephen King adaptations out there. If you want to see something a bit different and a little offbeat you will probably find this one to be well worth your time. If you want more of the same old formula horror flicks, you should probably look elsewhere.Enjoy, and thanks for taking the time to read my review. I hope it was helpful.Tom"
2,Not riding high,"A 70's hippie hitch hikes a 100 miles to see his dying mother that he has issues with and along the way must confront demons, some real some that exist only in his head.David Arquette did a good job as a bad guy demon, but the movie has a series of flashbacks that mislead the story and offer nothing to the end. It gets annoying trying to figure out what is actually happening and what is just the main character fantasizing. It grows tiresome."
2,RIDING THE BULLET,"Riding The Bullet, By Steven King, and now turned into a movie is about a college student named, Allan, trying to see his mother in a hospital. The only problem is Allan is HITCHING along the way. Along the way, he encounters TERRIFYING, SHOCKING MOMENTS, that happens with the supernatural.What the title, ""Riding the Bullet"" means that Allan has to face his fears, when he was what? Fourteen, when he was about to ride a rollercoaster called the ""Bullet"" but he thought a demon was going to kill him on the ride.This story was not that creepy, it has some cheap scares, but some good scenes. It's good to watch when your bored. But when you watch it more than two times, you start to get bored with it"
2,Its not scary and its not brilliant,"Its kind off like Stephen king meets Twilight Zone. Dont get me wrong both are brilliant but i appreciate King as more of an ""Epic"" 3 hour mini-series kind of storyteller and not the hitchcock short story kind of guy.It really feels like you have just watched a short story from Twilight zone at the end of the day. The character development and storyline is just too limited to be worth the 2 hours.If it was one of 3 stories on a (""twilight zone like"") compilation and only an hour or so in length, it would have been 5 stars!If you want an epic tale by King (like Rose Red, Storm of the centuary, the Shining) rather look for something else because this will dissapoint you.(Please forgive me Mr. King)"
1,Just not the same,I am a HUGE fan of Stephen King owning just about every book and movie ever made. I must say after reading the book and then seeing the movie come out I was mystified of how different the movie was from the book and how horrible the acting was. David Arquette was horrible and so was the crappy back story of Johnathon Jackson's character. Once they started on that my attention for this movie tanked. I really wish Hollywood would realize that the reason some movies fail when based on books is because they lose something when you change or leave out too much of the book.
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"Let me start off by saying that I love Stephen King, he's given me hours of entertainment and for that I am grateful. I am also a big fan of the lead in this movie Jonathan Jackson. Together I was expecting a can't miss movie, but it didn't quite work out that way. Riding The Bullet is just all around dull. The story was weak to begin with, the flashbacks were dull, the characters have 0 personality, and it just wasn't creepy in the slightest! If Disney made horror movies, they would be similar to this. I probably rated it higher than I should have because of my fondness for King and Jackson, but really this movie was a bore, don't waste your time."
3,Not like the book,"After I recently read the book ""Riding the Bullet"" I discovered there was a movie. I was so excited so a few days ago I ordered it on Amazon and watched it last night. The first 40 minutes of the movie was not in the book. The book was very short so maybe they just didn't have enough material to make a movie with. I just feel like they could have made it more like the book. I have mixed feelings about the movie. It was just OK for me..."
3,Pure Pop For Then People!,"Being a huge fan of early Dave Edmunds manic rockin' twang I was not a fan of this record when it was released, I didn't like it at all. There was way too much synth and Jeff Lynne and a dense sheen of cheese pop and I was into rootsy D.E. In retrospect this record makes more sense looking at the man's full musical history and early dabbling in pure pop productions influenced by Beach Boys and Phil Spector as this is pretty good and well produced super pop. Even the more rock n rolling material has a bubble gum pulse moving it in a slick stream. I remember when I first bought this I thought a lot of it sounded like subdued D.E. tunes that Jeff Lynne layed some ELO crap upon. It still sounds a little off to me but I recognize it's wonderful pop value now, it's catchy and fun. Not a great showcase for classic Dave Edmunds but a nice side trip for a true fan."
4,yes,"I like it I do I do I doYeah yeah yeahYeahYeahYeah..........Yeaheh yeah...goodnice, this what Dave does & he does it good."
3,More decorative than useful,"Since our kitchen has a rooster theme, they go perfectly with the decor. But the holes are small, and they're not the best for regular use. But they do look nice."
4,Great product for pets!,"After much research we purchased this insect repellent to keep the mosquitos off our precious kitty who was being bitten in the face. She hates it because it is so pungent, but just a little dab on her forehead seems to keep the mosquitos from biting her. I would purchase this product again. But a little goes a long way so I don't think I'm going to need more anytime soon."
1,Wrong item,"I ordered the 16 oz pet armor and received tiny 2 oz bottles that don't say anything about it's being for pets. The company refunded by money. I've used the actual product and it is very good, but don't buy this because it is mis-labeled."
4,book by John Creasey,As always it is very well written and manages to keep you interested and wanting to find out what happens next.
1,Worthless,"Sadly, I ordered this product before Major Schiller's informative review. As a matter of personal policy, I never ""register"" inexpensive software due to the spam and email/ID theft risks. Be warned that the sticker saying you have to register before the product is unlocked is INSIDE the CD case. There is no warning on the outside. This may affect returns, but is probably defensible. Sure, I'm willing to run their little maze - if they are willing to pay my hourly consultant's fees. As far as I'm concerned, I paid my money and I deserve a working product RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX."
3,a great book,Ghostville Elementary is so entertaining it makes you want to turn the page every time you read it. It's so funny because Cassidy gets into trouble because the ghost Ozzy make her life miserable unless she gets the ghost kids their old classroom back! Ghostville Elementary is quirky because there is a dead ghost class fighting for their old class back and it's a battle for the classroom! If you read Ghostville Elementary you would wish you had a class like that and want to read the other books about it because Ghostville Elementary such a good book!!!
5,Order was received as promised,I ordered this book and received it in two days. It was in great condition and packaged well. Thanks
1,Poor Quality!,Bit doesn't hold well. The design and the construction of the chuck doesnt work. Probably why these are selling cheaper than their weight in scrap metal. Very frustrating.
2,don't expect too much,"Not a horrendous tool but doesn't have the feel of a tool you can trust. I would spend the extra 5 to 10 bucks and go with the fuller brand bit and brace they have for sale here.It has not failed yet but I really don't trust it or feel I can rely on it.Wish I had spent the extra money for the fuller model.I wish there was a way to know where something was made before purchase.Also, my fault, I should have realized a cheaper price means a cheaper tool. I rarely use this so I did not want to spend too much but there is a cut off price below which you won't get a quality item. I should have realized that anything below 20 dollars for this tool would be an either an amazing bargin or more likely an inferior tool. Do yourself a favor spend a few more dollars and get a tool that you will enjoy using instead of a tool you'll avoid using."
1,Garbage - do not buy,"Waste of money, did not work and basically just fell apart. Didn't get a single use out of it. Look for a used older one somewhere else, you'll at least get a functioning tool."
2,Low Quality Tool,It may be that the price reflects the quality in this particular situation. The brace I recevied was poorly made and not lined up between the top handle and the jaws so that turning the handle caused a wobbly action that made using the tool very difficult.
1,poor adaptation,"This film is an adaptation of the first book in the new Frankenstein series by Dean Koontz. I am not really a Dean Koontz fan and have only read a few of his books, but the first 2 in this series were excellent. (I eagerly await the 3rd, which is past due to come out.) This movie was a very boring, poor adaptation in my opinion. Why Dean has such bad luck with movies based on his books I cannot understand. Every movie version of his books has been really bad, this one is no exception. It is dull, which is hard to understand because the book is anything but dull. It is no wonder that Dean took his name off this project. That should have been sufficient warning to me. If I could get my money back, I would. Save yours, or better yet, buy the Frankenstein books to enjoy the real story."
2,"No, No, No","Save your money, read the book. The movie tried to follow the book but it was so disjointed it made no sense."
2,Turn on a light already!,"About 15 minutes into the movie, I wanted to shout at the filmmakers ""turn on a light already!"". It is dark. Even when it's light (outside daylight street) it's dark, like it was underexposed two stops. My wife and I were trying to place the lead actor, and I recognized his voice, as I could not see his face.In one early scene, people were talking in a courthouse. The background was lit, but the people were not, giving them a backlit effect. The needed key lights or reflectors were simply not present. Yet it looked like a professionally shot movie, not just some guy holding a camera. So it was an intentional effect, even to the point of distraction.The characters were often in silhouette, with parts of a face occasionally visible. But this effect was carried through to every scene, which debases the effect when they are indeed in a creepy place. And when it looks like a normal shot except for a missing light on the subject, it just looks wrong and annoying."
1,B O R I N G!!!!!!,"I didn't know that this was a Koontz-based scrapped pilot until I read the last review - which makes it even more disappointing. If this movie doesn't put you to sleep, nothing will. This has all the ""drama"" angles of Buffy the Vampire Slayer with hardly any action and then as the movie builds to it's peak THE CREDITS ROLL!!!! STAY AWAY, folks. I am a Dean Koontz fan and I'm thinking he had very little to do with this. Parker Posey was the only enjoyable thing about the movie, but people looking at ""the monster"" and talking about him being in a freak show when he just had a little scar on his face - come on, I've seen worse at the swimming pool. This is an hour and a half of your life you will never get back. Frankenstein Unbound was a B movie, but was much better than this."
5,Nice update of an old classic,"I wish this pilot had been picked up and made into a tv series, but nonetheless it was a good flick. Based on the Dean Koontz novel it basically deals with the social and religious aspects of cloning and the possible dangers of creating something that may not have a God given soul. The book is better (actually a series of books now) but check out this flick."
1,total tv-movie b.s.,"I caught this when it was first aired like a year ago on tv and I thought it was pretty lame. ""Frankenstein"" is nto really a good title, as this thing has little to do with any of the actual literature or previous films it shares a name with.Vincent Perez, who played the Crow in the god-awful ""Crow: City Of Angels"" stars as a Frankenstein monster, kind of, who also doubles as a mysterious informant for a tough/but/pretty cop (Parker Posey) whos investigating some weird events involving a genetic scientist guy. There's no real ending, since this was intended to be a series perhaps, and the whole thing is just bland and pointless. Could have been a cool idea, though."
2,Frankenstein DVD (2005( Review,"It's an interesting and fairly stylish film; however, I felt the DVD ended abruptly without showing what the end would be (very strange); that's why I only give it two stars. The way each scene changed it looked as if it was a TV movie, and that a lot of editing had been done to shorten the film.The picture and sound are very good and it's a 1.85:1, which is enhanced for 16:9 TVs."
2,What were they thinking?,"I was kind of upset that Dean Koontz's name did not appear anywhere on this film. The book was one of the better ones I have read and for the film makers to basically quote word for word from the book without even a mention to Koontz is ridiculous. They also took out what I thought was one of the best story lines with the other serial killer Roy. I thought that added a good little side story. Also, Victor Helios and his creatures were not really explained all that much in the movie. Randall Six did not appear, and the scenes with Erica weren't that clear. I don't know, I hope there won't be another movie to tarnish this series of great novels."
2,Terrible,"Poorly done.This first book by Dean Koontz was awesome!The movie, not so much.In the book Deucalion is a very large very scary and grotesque man with a very derformed face.In the movie he is a good looking man with a scar on his face. ??REALLY??Just crap."
3,Daughter Loves it...but doors fall off all the time,"My 4 year old daughter loves this toy...although it's often frustrating for me, because everytime she plays with it, I'm beckoned to put the oors back on at least 3 times...they fall off everytime you try to open the doors. Other than that, it's great...a car, two dolls, two pets, and a bunch of clothes."
3,Better live with Steve Morse in tow but still too flamenco.,"Long-TimeGuitarist (Texas) wrote: ""My apologies to Satriani/Vai/Johnson, but these guys are THE original guitar trio.""My ""apologies"" but you're wrong too!! The ""original"" guitar trio was Coryell/McLaughlin/De Lucia - Meeting of the Spirits, then Larry had to leave and was replaced Di Meola. Do your homework boy!! After Live In San Francisco there was a reunion CD in 1996. From what I've read though, I doubt there'll be another including Al."
5,The most amazing trio CD,"I have to just say, I love this album! These three guys were at their prime as a group, and you can definetly tell. On their first CD, it was all live, and it had it share of faults and everything, and plus the guys weren't as telepathic as most groups are. Well, they'd been together a few years here, and the result is incredible. I'd say that this is the fastest guitar music i've ever heard in my life, these guys were shredding amazingly fast, and a year or two before Yngwie was in the main stream! The only problem I have with this CD is that it's too short! I'd bet that this album is barely 30 minutes long, if even that. Al himself said in an interview once that it was defintely too short, and that if they'd do something like that these days, they'd go to hell! It's a great CD though, if you love great acoustic music, then definetly get this. They really do play with passion, grace, and fire....intensity and emotion."
4,Reawakening after Post-Modernity,"While Eagleton seems to dismiss theory just because the revolution it might have envisaged actually did not happen (as if a few philosophical works could have been enough to cause it) he nevertheless has the merit of warning against that unfortunate consequence of the misuse of deconstruction that we may call ""the bog of indeterminacy."" Why has Derrida's crucial notion of ""différance"" de facto turned into a diffused practice of indifference? Probably because many post-modern intellectuals have grown suspicious of all material and rational distinctions whatsoever. Among the various intellectual habits, there is the one typical of ""those who know and distinguish,"" warned Roger Fowler: let's still try to be among them, repeats Terry Eagleton. Personally, I could not agree more."
1,The Commisar's disenchantment with theory:,"After Theory by Terry Eagleton is a the typical product of a man who has set himself up a commissar of culture.Eagelton doesn't so much argue his points as pontificate. Theory didn't achieve the socialist revolution, he so badly wants, ergo theory must go.The book is a compendium of everything the Oxford Don hates: America, Jews, the free market, progress, the rule of law, middle class life and any one who doesn't share his warped Socialist view of the world."
2,A screed with occasional flashes of insight,"When I first read Eagleton's Literary Theory, I thought he was brilliant: knowledgeable and witty. This book has occasional flashes of insight, but is marred by, among other things, grotesque caricatures of pretty much all things American. I find fault with many of the same things that Eagleton belabors, only I can do without the puerile snottiness and strained attempts at eccentric humor. Too much of a screed. Unimpressive."
4,An interesting read,I flipped through this book in a college library and found it very interesting. Most enlightening were the real life experiences embedded in the techincal( for lack of a better word) information provided.
5,Great Item!,Great item for pitching training. Fast shipping. Would highly recommend. Bought for a 10 year old competitive softball player (girl). She loves it.
2,there are better...,"Although the translation is done in a smooth and lucid style, there are certain disadvantages. Firstly the translation is done in an old English style (i.e. ""thees and thous""). Secondly, the author forces his own opinions and the opinions of his unrecognized sect into the translation of certain verses. A much better translation would be ""Towards Understanding the Qur'an"" by Abul A'la Maududi (published by the Islamic Foundation of UK). The language is much more modern, and the commentary is fresh and informative."
3,meh,"I didn't expect 90% of most pages to be dedicated to footnotes. I kind of wanted to read the english translation, and have the commentary separated. Partly my fault for not researching more."
5,Enjoyable and informative.,I gladly read every word cover to cover. This translation and the commentary is great for those who wish to more fully understand The Holy Qur'an.
3,"Please remove The first review from ""The reader from NY""","NOWHERE has the Prophet ever said ""women do not go to heaven, are inferior to men"". This person should be ashamed of himself, he is expressing his ignorant opinions, linking him to the name of the Prophet. Theses are offensive to any respected muslim."
1,Test The Spirits,"Based on the pagan moon god out of 360 gods worshiped pre-Islam and incorrect Bible interpretation. 1 John 4:1 Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world."
3,Atypical Lo-fi Record,"Fans of Guided By Voices, Sebadoh, Shrimper and Pere Ubu will dig this record. It's sort of like Peter Laughner in a NYC 4-track basement sort of way. Definitely interesting. Reminds me of Eric's Trip meets Velvet Underground as well. What he lacks as a vocalist, he makes up as a songwriter.Tracks 1-7, 10-14 are 1990 cassette8,9 are from a 7"" single from 1990"
5,great educational start off for infant,my daughter was 9 months old when she was gifted this from the grandparents. It encourages a joy for reading when followed along with the book.
4,An overall excellent movie,"As a European film in German, unlike American movies with fast-paced scenes, the scene shots are choppy, with sometimes long pauses and sad music. This story is about a boy with a horrible family life, constant fighting with his mother at home. His poor hen-pecked father has already given up. His younger brother is lonely and constantly yelled at by their mother. This young man finds comfort in a youth-based neo-nazi group. He gets deeper and deeper into the organization, until he finally quits school and leaves home. He is a troubled and unloved young man that finds comfort and meaning in the neo-nazi group. This is what makes this film so real. Unfortunately, the movie has a tragic end to it that is a consequence of getting so deeply involved with such violent people. This is an excellent film, albeit choppy, with a realistic portrayal of disturbed youth seeking meaning and happiness in life. Sadly, the neo-nazi organization meets none of his needs."
5,You would have never known Access could do these how-to,"This is a very helpful book for solving problems and adding creative solutions. You would never imagine some the tips this book shows you. One way to impress your collegues is using some of these ""how-to"" solutions. The author explains the answers to the how-to's in easy to understand language. A must have if you are a serious solution provider."
3,Make a deal with the city,"I like Make a Deal with the city. The rest of the CD doesn't really do too much for me. I heard the first cut at the end of a movie that I've forgotten about, but the song made enough of an impression that I wanted to hear the song again. Bypass this CD and just get the song. There isn't too much else here, in my opinion."
1,$153 for a photo copy,I paid $153 for a new hardcopy from Amazon. What I received was simply a photocopy. The text that was supposed to be in color is barely visible. The book won't live long - the pages are tearing off after I just browsed through pages. I am returning. No point paying for a brand new copy.
1,poor condition,There was a lot of writing in the book and also hi- lighter was used throughout . I would never have bought the book if I knew it was in that condition
1,Too Hard To Read,"When you feel feverish, and it's night time and the light is a little dimmer, and you feel pretty crummy, you'll have a devil of a time reading the tiny little dots to try to figure out what the heck your temperature is."
3,Ones that are still active seem to work,"Great idea - and cost is reasonable. However, like some of the other reviewers, when I received my box of disposable thermometers, many of them had already been activated, and were no longer usable. I have used these several times, and they appear to give a good temperature reading. I like the disposable feature, and will likely purchase similar product in the future, but will not purchase via the mail. Not confident that the warehouse handling or shipping protects these well enough to keep them from being activated ahead of time.Based on the cost, I did not return."
4,Sanitary option for thermometric needs,"These are great disposable thermometers, accurate to fractions of a degree. I prefer these because they are disposable and thus more sanitary, as well as not requiring a battery or special care. Throw a few wherever you might need them, I have some in my desk at the office."
2,Hard to Read No Instruction On Each,"I got these for first aid kits and the box contains the instructions but the individual packages do not. They are difficult to read as the green dots often turn black quickly; therefore, not allowing you to measure your temperature.I like the thermometers for a cheap not exact check but overall they could have done better.Here is a link to the instructions: [...]Hopefully they'll keep the link."
2,poor techniques,"This whole book offered approximately 4 to 5 good techniques. It offered a few more ""ok"" techniques. I gave the book away after owning it for a week, not much to offer in solid grappling skills. The authors are not experts in the grappling arts, they show poor techniques from even worse positions. The account of ""no holds barred"" fighting is not very good either. Anyone with more than 6 months of solid grappling skills, will see this book is not for the serious jiu-jitsu/grappling practitioner."
5,Great book on submission wrestling,"Mark Hatmaker has left a good impression on me with his (I think)first book. Though not realy NHB, as strikes aren't covered, this book had info on takedowns, possitions, reversals, escapes, submissions, drills... Although the book didn't have 'every single move in the world', what was presented would help anyone improve their game. It is as complete as a book of it's size can be on the subject it covers. It is well-written, logically presented, and has me eagerly anticipating the second book. If you are interrested in submission grappling at all, get this book; you will not be disappointed."
3,Questionable techniques,"I agree with some of the other reviewers that the techniques in this book are not the best. For example, 1)the attacker crossing his feet during armbar and, 2) the attackee rolling in the oppisite direction of an armbar trusting that his clasped hands will be more powerful than the attacker's legs and arms. The first can result in a painful footlock, and the second will most likely result in a fracture of the elbow when the hand clasp is broken. If you buy this book make sure that you also buy a book by the Gracies and/or the Machados."
5,Alot of techniques and instruction for the price ($13),"Mark Hatmaker writes No Holds Barred Fighting (NHBF) Ultimate Guide primarily as a NHBF and a submission wrestling handbook. I bought and use it as a self-defense guide to ground fighting. Supposedly 75% of all fights end up on the ground. He does an excellent job of covering takedowns, takedown defense, ground controls or hold downs, submissions, and escapes. He is able to pack a wealth of techniques in 250 pages without being overly detailed or verbose because the 695 pictures are so excellent - a good picture is worth a thousand words! He does offer explanations when and where needed. If I had a ten best list of self-defense or the martial arts, this book would be on that list."

5,Mmmmm dark,This is a well themed mix cd. I don't usually go for mix cd's but I took a chance because it had an Amanda Palmer song on it that I wanted. I ended up liking most of the songs quite a bit. There's a few odd ones stuck in there but all in all it's very moody but not super slow paced.
4,Sweet.,"Good mix with some great tracks! Top tracks are Gemini Girly Song by Katzenjammer Kabarett (...), Simon's Sleeping by Pretty Balanced (...), and True Love by ThouShaltNot (...).This CD starts out strong, and ends stronger. As a whole, it's very dark (thus the name), but it's also very powerful. Whether you're a fan of goth rock or not (I myself am not), this is a great mix.In addition to online, you can get this CD at any Hot Topic store. Check it out!"
5,Fun and inexpensive entree into goth/punk cabaret,"The Dresden Dolls, Rozz Williams, and Jill Tracey tracks stand out. It's an inexpensive disk which is perfect for the cabaret fan who wants to check out the modern take on it, or the dark/goth music fan looking at this retro trend. Good disk."
4,The Best,"This product is the best software for girls. This organizes telephones, adresses events. The best thing about this is that it saves your diary enteries with a password and in a secert code. So even if someone does know the password they cant read it. The down part about this prouduct is that if the software gets deleted all your files are erased because it doesn;t save your files on your computer wich is why I took away a star and wich is why they ask u to print all your files just in case."
2,Secret Diary,"Password protected, Address book, Secret Message writer and Decoder, Stationary, AND Diary all in one program. What more could you want? Well...maybe some copy and paste or easy backup.I used this diary wonderfully for two years--two years!--when I realized I couldn't copy and paste into Word, or somehow retrieve it. In five to ten years, that program won't be working and those TWO YEARS of my life...fully documented (10 a month at least) will be gone. I now have to print out every one of those pages...what a waste of paper! It's a wonderful wonderful program. But if you actually want to READ your diary 10 years from now...just look elsewhere. It's not worth it..."
1,This no longer works. Calendar is out of date!,"This was a decent program back when it was originally released. It has a lot of useful features. However, the calendar and diary functions expired at the end of 2009 and now you will get error messages if you try to use them. Don't waste money on this now."
2,Informative but hard to read,"This book is the first I ever read about Alexander and was a little bit disappointing. Sure the information you want is all there, somewhere, but it is neither easy to find nor interesting to read. I was given the book at Christmas and only finished it at July. More than often the author takes several pages to describe various conflicting sources of historical information, but in the end does not conclude anything. The book is also rather poor in maps and figures and the text often mentions places and roads without referring the reader to the existing maps. Some times you read through 2 or 3 pages without fully understanding the description, just to find out that the necessary map was there, 2 pages ahead. Also, there is no detailed description of the battle units and armaments used at Alexander's times."
