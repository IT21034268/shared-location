5,Dense and intense,"I love this record, it's got so many layers and can be listened to over and over and you can hear new things each time. Thunderous drumming and hard rock riffing. I was a little disappointed in the CD version because it's missing a track. The original LP had two parts to one of the songs, I can't remember which one, but it had a fade out part I/fade in part II and then some extended jamming on the second part.""Marbles"" and ""Don't Let the Dragon Eat Your Mother"" both worth the price alone."
3,Devtion,"The title should indicate that this is an early 70's retrospective; the cover photo even shows McLaughlin at a much later date. I was disappointed that a.) This contained selections I already had; and b.) they were not among the very best of that era anyway.However, this is not a bad choice if one wants to simply collect some more from this great guitarist."
1,Skynyrd Song Book,"I thought the book would contain more than it did. The songs are NOT in tablature form and do not contain any of the solos, just the lyrics and main riffs. I was pretty disappointed."
4,A very interesting compilation,"I was expecting one of those custom tribute albums where a bunch of srtists agree to make fresh versions of Beatles songs, but this is something a little different. From the varying recording quality it seems that the people at Recall have scoured the archives and done a compilation of previously existing covers. The result is a bit of curate's egg, but there are some very interesting tracks and it is a worthwhile buy for Beatles lovers who also like sixties style reggae. Some of the tracks have obviously been sourced from vinyl as you can sometimes hear surface noise, but all in all I'd recommend it."
4,Roots,If you are strictly a Beatles fan you may not like this album but if you are truly a fan of real roots regae you should own this one.
1,Dumb Marine?,"I clicked on ""I have listened to this recording, and I want to review it"" but the truth is that I have listened to this recording and I don't want to review it -- or ever hear of it again -- and neither will you. Move on. Nothing to see here."
3,hat band,"nice band looked and worked great...till it got damp..then the ""made in china"" stamped on the inside showed through...bummer..."
3,Great Book.....but very dense,"This is an amazing book but be well aware this is a dense read and not a casual ""Pick it up and put it down in a hour."" Erikson covers a variety of topics and presents his facts and reasoning very well but this book is more academic than casual."
2,It's OK,"I was introduced to mate in Argentina and I drink it often. This yerba mate is OK but it is not of the quality of the yerba mate imported from Argentina, Brazil, or Praguay."
1,ugh . . .,"I should preface this review by saying that I am a Kerastase fan, and I have used the Oleo Relax shampoo for a long time. I have thick, wavy, color-treated hair that needs excellent moisturizing and smoothing to look good. This mask was, for lack of a better word, weird. It smells like the other Kerastase products, but I could barely read the instructions on the jar (which is an inconvenient container in any case). The mask sat on my hair forever (you have to leave on for 10-15 min.) in the shower and felt worse and worse -- it may not be apparent but this product is not for those with sensitive skin. It burned my scalp and make my hair feel heavy and lifeless. Very disappointing for the cost! I will go back to Pureology products, which are gentle and work much better."
3,Sci-fi?,"This film has a good premise and excellent material to work from, but does not avail itself of it. This is a passable movie that could have been great if it had followed the novel more closely. If you are under 15, see the film...if you are older, read the book. It is an excellent work to read."
1,Oh dear,"Sorry, but this is a dismal movie. It starts badly when the credit blurb on the packaging says Paul, not Poul Anderson. Not only is it completely unlike the book but the attempted humour almost entirely misses the mark. The human characters are portrayed as complete imbeciles and the aliens are not much better. I accept that compromises have to be made when adapting novels to screen, but why bother with the license in the first place if you are simply going to use the title and ignore the plot?"
2,"Not the book, and its not Monty Python","I was disappointed that this was not an adaption of the very funny Poul Anderson book. Other that a credit to him and the fact that the story involves knights and aliens, there is scant relationship between the book and the movie.This movie is more akin to Benny Hill than Monty Python. Very low brow and broad.That said, the movie was mildly amusing. Not worth buying unless you find it in a cut-out bin."
4,A damn good laugh,"I just bought this DVD a few weeks ago, the price was right and I quite liked the novella. I agree with the others, its not like the book, but quite frankly, the book wasn't this funny. Its British camp humour, with a lot of stock character actors turning up in strange places, and the narration is excellent.If you wanted this to be the movie of the book, don't watch it. If you just want an unpretentious laugh, with some clever dialoge, see it."
1,Don't watch this unless someone will pay you (a lot),"I gave it a try because I loved the book and because one of the actors was in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films. My gosh! What trash. Not funny. Terrible acting. Terrible screenplay. Obviously, a fair amount of energy was put into the sets, but the special effects were comparable to Plan 9. Don't do it. No matter how much you loved the book, I warn you, you will regret the experience."
2,Not very good adaptation of a good novel.,"Doesn't come close to the fine romp Poul Anderson's book was. Rent it, if you must see it. Then read the book again."
2,90 minutes without engaging your brain,"It looks as though someone has seen Monty Python & the Holy Grail, thought it funny but not really understood why. The outward attempt at humour is there, but it never really comes off. A pity, since this was an enjoyable book, and it could have made an enjoyable film in the right hands.However, that said, there are worse ways of spending 90 minutes, and the plot will not require the use of any intellect to understand."
5,Unbelievably stylish,"Unbelievably stylish. A magical experience that will leave you breathless and wanting more, while wondering, ""How can this get any better?!"" A wonderful album which I've played again and again and again and again since I purchased it a couple of months ago. I've returned to its tracks again and again, even after sampling other albums. There's a timelessness to its style that never wears out on the hearer. Every track glitters and makes you want to get up and dance, or at least strut like a ultra-hip super model!"
4,Great music,"Not as good as the others in the series, but pretty good! If you need another CD in this music category, this is a good add."
3,"Ya it's good, but not that gooooood","This new music called lounge or chill out comes originally from Paris and Berlin and started in france with Stephane pompougnac the DJ at Hotel Costes and Claude Chall the DJ from Buddha Bar .The basic CD's that can recommend are: Buddha Bar 1- 2, Costes 1-2-3, Berlin Lounge, De Phazz, Cafe del Mar 4-6, St-Germain (which is much more Jazz) and Aqua Bassino.The fourth edition of Hotel Costes is good but not as much as the three others. First they are not as original as the used to be second this one is much faster more Dance and not as musically chalanging.. But it has some few good tracks, I still do recommend it after the three first ones ."
2,Sleep Inducing CD,"If you want to pick a Costes album from the series, this one is not the one to get. The first 3 tracks have a lot of momentum but it flags from there to the end. My favorite one is probably Vol. 3: it's got more flavor and groove."
3,ok,i have tried lots of scrubs and this one does nothing for my skin. A wonderfull smell. very refreshing. But doesnt do what a scrubs suppposed to do exfoliate
3,Not sure what my verdict is,"The product is definitely light hold. It smells nice. If I put too much (which doesn't require that much product) then my hair feels sticky. I have thin, straight, Asian hair if that serves as a good reference. I like application after blow-drying my hair better than before. It's easier to gauge how much I need with my hair dry."
2,"Does a basic job, but not more than that","We had a little bit higher exception before making the purchase. But a little bit disappointed after using it. I am not saying it does not work. But for less amount of money, we can probably find something similar. It does lift the hair and make it easier to control, but did not make the hair feels comfortable. For this price, I definitely expecting to have more than the most basic benefits. Find something else or wait the price of this one go under $10"
1,Must be Fake,"I just received my thickening spray and I'm sure it is fake. It does not smell like the other (almost empty) bottle I purchased at my salon. My hair did not feel as good as it normally does, and it made my head itch. Buyer beware!!"
3,Worked at first,"This product did a good job on my flat and fine hair but after using it for about a week it weighed my hair down and made it look and feel greasy, didn't work for me and isn't worth the money"
2,Bring back the old formula!,"Thickening spray was my favorite of ALL my beauty products but now it is a waste of money. It was worth the high price before but not any more. It does not give the volume it did before and leaves my hair baby soft, as in limp and not full. I need to find a new thickening product. Very disappointing."
3,"For fine hair, there are better products out there.","I had high hopes for B&B Thickening Spray, that were soon dashed. This made my fine hair actually look stringy at the ends. So next application I used only at crown. My hair did not get the thickening look I was hoping for ( well, no more than any drugstore product costing $2). It also left an odd coating and feel on my hair."
1,rip off,"I think this product is a total waste of money. It does absolutly nothing for my hair. May as well spray water on it, no more effective than that!"
1,Terrible,"Upon purchasing this product, I'd hoped it would be equivilant to the product I normally purchase at the salon. I was horribly disappointed. It was nothing at all like the typical product, rather much more like water. The normal scent was not present, the product made my hair greasy and my head itched all day long. I would very much like to return this. It's not at all the same product that is purchased at the salon. I was sorely disappointed."
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT,"This is the most awful product I've ever tried and then to have paid so much money for it. It does not give volume to your hair, what it does it makes it greasy."
3,A very good product.,"This product is very good, but I didn't have the same result that I expected. I bought to use on the fringe of hair to give volume. But as my fringe is long, it weighs, and the product does not have the same effect."
4,Im not sure its,a Thickener but it definitely helps keep your hair in place.Its not gooey or sticky and like a nice light spray. Good for the day.
5,"Solution to managing thin, wispy hair!!","I don't have much time or patience in the morning to style my hair like the professionals but with just a few sprays and 5 minutes of blow drying, my short, thin, straight hair is frizz-free, more voluminous, and tamed (especially living in humid weather where frizz is a given). An added plus is that my hair is NOT waxy or sticky to the touch afterwards. My hair is not limp and has body throughout the day. Excellent product for those with thin hair and are tired of styling products that leave your hair feeling heavy."
2,New Formula Is No Good,"I have been using Bumble and Bumble Thickening Spray for YEARS and a bottle usually lasts me awhile, so between that and cycling it with other products I only recently had to reorder it. I noticed as soon as I received it that the name had changed to Thickening HAIRspray. Well, they seem to have added a styling element to it that makes it sticky, and I am forced to return it. The old formula did just that: it was a thickening spray, and made blowouts easier and with better results. The volumizing element was unparalleled! But the new formula adds a stickiness, like a non-aerosol hairspray would, and I can't get past it. Oh well, time to find a new volumizing spray..."
5,A Masterpiece,"This is one of those wonderful children's books that has a level of cleverness and humor that make it equally appealing to discerning adults. Highly recommended. Also check out ""Roberto the Insect Architect"" by the same author, for the same reasons."
4,Nice toy.,"I was very excited to find this hairstying/makeup head. One of my top reasons was that it looks like a little girl rather than a woman. The doll head does look very nice and the hair looks great (almost like real hair). It is easy to comb and the hair doesn't pull out. My only issue with this doll head is (the reason for only 4 stars), if you take the pony tail holder out and let all the hair hang down, she looks nearly bald on top of her head! I guess the company figured they could save money by skimping on the hair on top. It was a huge disapppointment for my daughter, but we just keep her hair pulled half up from now on. If it didn't have this problem, it would be absolutely perfect---what a shame."
3,"cute, but hair is not long enough","this is very cute, great quality and durability. unlike most doll heads, the hair is securely rooted and does not come out even with the toughest brushing or combing. the only bad thing about it is that the hair is not long enough to do things with. you can brush, put clips in, etc. but it's impossible to even put a ponytail in because it's so short and full. you can't tell from the picture."
3,"Probably the best hair style doll you are going to find, but.....","As I said, this is probably the best hair styling head you are going to find, however it irks me that they couldn't have made the body a little taller. It's hard to brush the hair because the head/neck/shoulders are so short.Also, for this price they really could have put more hair bows, ties, elastics, etc. in the box. It's hard to style hair if you don't have the accessories, you really cannot do much. After paying that amount of money, my daughter shouldn't have to be rooting around her own stuff to do her doll's hair. A storage compartment in her back to hold accessories might be nice too."
4,Corolle Hairstyling and Makeup Head,"My 8 year old daughter really enjoys this toy. She loves that she can wash the doll's hair. We were excited that we could apply makeup to the doll's face but it really doesn't stick to the face well. I am continuing to try to find makeup that won't stain the face but will be visible upon application. The hair is a little sparse on the crown of the head but it stays in well during brushing. I like that the doll looks like a girl and not a woman. Overall, I am satisfied with this product."
5,Pleased,"Like another reviewer, I purchased this head because it looks like a sweet little girl and not a glamour type head. It came with no directions, though, about how to clean the face (removing makeup). And it also has to be held some while styling hair but our six year old has quickly figured out how to style and hold down. This was definitely her favorite Christmas gift and I recommend it to others. I feel the quality is better than some of the other ""heads"" on the market."
4,The Forsyte Saga miniseries,"The miniseries was excellent, but it was supposed to have ""closed captions"" and it did not. We're in our 70s and our hearing is such that we understood what was being said only about 70% ot the time."
5,Forsythes --- FINALLY!!!,"I have waited for years to see this most beloved ""Masterpiece Theatre"" series appear on VHS or DVD. Finally, here it is -- the REAL Forsythes! I admit I cannot compare this to the more recent incarnation of Galsworthy's clan, only because I could not bring myself to watch it -- the impression of these earlier portrayals is too vivid in my mind and heart. Viewing this in my teens inspired me to read all the Galsworthy novels in the series, and I can say that the version presented here is faithful and true to that literary accomplishment. Eric Porter, Susan Hampshire, and Kenneth More (I fell in love with him here, I swear!) are unforgettable. Do yourself a favor -- purchase this set and indulge yourself in classy, glorious, enlightened entertainment!"
2,An acquired taste,"I was lured by the reviewsbut I found the series very dated and the characters hard to relate to after having fallen in love with the later version. It is quite comprehensive, tho."
4,pity ! no translation !,I am very surprised that in very elegant and technicaly perfect DVDI don't find any translation to a non-English language. Y. Remetz
3,Family Rating PG13,"Besides my interest in British movies from this era, I look for movies I will enjoy and I feel comfortable having on my shelf for my grandchildren to run across. Although the story was fascinating as it weaved relationships in and out of the lives of the characters, it appeared that infidelity was a way of life. I gave my series of The Forsyte Saga to a mature friend."
2,forget it,Tedious and seemingly long. The version starring Damian Lewis is much more entertaining. He is an awsome actor in everything he does.
4,Forsyte Saga,"Not that I have viewed the product yet, It was a Christams present for someone else, but, The product arrived is great time, in great shape, the service was good, and I had no problem with payment for the item. To say that I am completely satisfied, would be a slight understatment."
5,Outstanding actors and wonderful series,"I waited forever to buy this, I just finished watching it, it was outstanding, the cast were picked perfect for their parts, I wish TV today would be done so well, of course TV does not seem to do mini series as they used too.The first 30 min all the characters appear in a gathering, this may seem confusing at first but it will all fall into place and you will just love it."
5,Forsyte Saga Complete Series (1969),The series is able to accurately capture the essence and spirit of the multiple Galsworthy novels that comprise the Forsyte sage. I have read them all and am pleasantly surprised at how well the essentials are maintained in the 28 hours of the programTechnically the product is superb.
5,The Origin TV adaptation,"The Origin TV adaptation and arguably the better of the two available although I accept that to be subjective. For those who had Victorian grandparents, black and white movies would seem to re-capture that period. Maybe that was also true of those great British actors from the past. Eric Porter as Soames is of course the star, and as a character, John Galsworthy claimed that Soames gradually took over the three original books; it's wonderful when character creation is that good. The morality has of course lost its edge over the last 100 years but its worth recalling:Human Nature, under its changing pretensions and clothes, is and ever will be very much of a Forsyte, and might, after all, be a much worse animal.--from the Preface."
4,The Forsyte Saga,"The acting was first rate. The filming was in black and white, sometimes somewhat hazy but satisfactory. The story followed the book reasonably well. The set was worth the price."
5,The Forsyte Saga,"I was thrilled to have the chance to re-visit this series created by the BBC during my teenage years. The acting and costuming were every bit as memorable as I had remembered. It was also wonderful to see the leading lady, Nyree Dawn Porter, in this role again, as she is also a New Zealander by birth. The attention to detail was superb and my only regret is that it was not filmed in colour as it was just too early for that. However, I must add that after the first few minutes, that fact was inconsequential because of its brilliance."
3,101 Drum Circle Rhythms,"I am an absolute beginner when it comes to drumming, and this DVD wasn't very helpful for me. The hand movements are too fast. Also, I would have preferred that the angles be shot from the same view I'd have while playing a drum instead of the opposite. It is simply too confusing to watch the hand movements from the opposite direction. It definitely isn't a good teaching tool for someone who doesn't already know how to drum. This DVD seems like it would be helpful for someone who can just listen to the rhythms and pick them up. I think I might find this DVD useful in the future once I am able to learn the basics of drumming and that is why I rate it with a least a 3."
2,not easy for beginners,"This DVD has a large collection of nice rhythms with clear views of hand pattern and should be nice to drum along with after one learns the rhythm. Unfortunately it is not easy for beginners to pick up the rhythms, which is a shame. If he would start each rhythm in slow motion (say, half speed) for a few rounds before going into normal speed, that would make life so much easier for learning. It would also help to ""sing"" the rhythms in the beginning (e.g. ga-da-gung-dung or base-slap-tone type of thing). These are all simple techniques used in most drum videos. I hope he would adopt them in a future release. It would also be nice to have these rhythms written down in a simple notation for quick reference."
2,Not Up To Expectations,"I am a beginner and as such have several issues with this DVD. All with the way it was put together. There is only one view,frontal. An over the shoulder viewing angle would be easier to follow. Also, there is just one speed. So getting the hand movements is a challenge. Did use the DVD player controls to slow it down but can't hear the rhythm. The one thing I can't get the DVD player to do is to go to a particular selection. Its either watch each rhythm sequentially or hit fast forward and skip 5 at a time. The GO TO on the player doesn't get a response from the DVD. Was generous with a 2 star rating."
3,Just Recorded Drum Rhythms,"It is what it is, but I thought there would be at least an introduction. Got to be serious about learning the drum rhythms."
3,"Slightly Campy, Mildly Off-Beat, and Weirdly Funny","Although time has reduced this film's ""horror"" level to nil, DEVIL DOLL remains a reasonably entertaining little movie about an escaped convict bent upon revenge on those who framed him--and who uses the skills of his mad-doctor friend to miniturize normal humans to doll size, so they might act as agents of his revenge.The film's special effects hold up well enough, but the real pleasure of this film is in the performances of Lionel Barrymore as the escaped convict and Rafaela Ottiano as the mad-doctor, with Barrymore donning drag to escape police detection and Ottiano at her most memorably eccentric. Both have more fun than the law allows!"
5,Fabulous,This was an incredible movie! (If it's the one I'm thinking of) It left my with the covers over my head wondering what was going to happen next!
1,Not a good deal,"The price may be good, but when I soldered my first transistor, the conductors around the holes came off the board. I tried a second board (I bought 10 of them) and the same thing happened. Unless you want to solder pin-to-pin, I don't recommend this product. 2 stars.Edit: Looking at the INSANE price now, I'd definitely not recommend this (they were about 50 cents when I got them). For 7 bucks each, you may as well get an entire do-it-yourself perf-board kit and get professional results."
1,Just a single board ?!!!,This is an outrageous price for just a single board. It cost just a few dimes to manufacture in some 3rd world country.A BLATANT RIP-OFF !
4,All in a lighthouse,"This entire story takes place on a tiny island with a lighthouse. And yet it never seems confined. I have not seen this episode on TV, so it may have been different to watch as it never changed location, but when reading it things flowed very well. Once again the Doctor has to save the world, this time with the help of Leela. The story takes place in the early 1900's and the newly invented electric generator plays a central part.Don't expect a lot of character development, which is typical for these novelizations. Do expect lots of action. A quick fun read. Enjoy!"
2,"Indestructible, but hard to use","This is a cute cup with little pictures and french words. It feels sturdier than the average sippy cup, but the top is difficult to get on and off. Out of frustration, we now only use it as a two handled cup without the lid."
5,BEST DEATH METAL BAND EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Impaled kicks [rear]! Their lyrics are sick and the music is heavy. I'm looking forward to more Impaled cd's to come out. If you are a death metal fan, buy this cd. You WON'T be disappointed."
5,Impaled,"A brilliant new album from Impaled. In here the stereotypical growl of death metal is given so much variation, it adds interest to every track. The rhythms are carved out with extreme precision, making this album a brutal classic. Buy it!"
5,"Antonio Stradivari, His Life and Works by W. Hill","Well, this is not the first boook on Stradivari's Life and Works I have had, but somehow they have disappeared from my collection, mostly due to moving. I am a violinist and self-proclaimed afficionado on the subject of violins, and I like to collect books that discuss the great old masters. I am still trying to add to my collection, but many books on the subject are out of print and very expensive, As far as my order was concerned, it was expedited quickly and I got a brand new edition. By the way, the original edition of this book in hard cover is about $3500. So, this was a lot more economical, but I would love to have the original. Very pleased with my purchase and the many purchased I have made over the years."
3,Good Product,"I like this product. However, it does not allow you to name the folders. The model I purchased two years ago will do that. Also, the memory stick is a proprietary item. I wanted to use an off the shelf memory stick. The best part is the reliability of Amazon. The order arrived when they said it would."
1,No way to download Digital Voice Editor Software,"I bought the ICD-MX20 a week ago. I was surprised that Sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named ""Digital Voice Editor"". Sony Customer Service staff told me that if you lost the CD that came with the box, you had to buy a new one. Only patches of the software are available to download.This immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged. Sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services. Think twice before making your buying decision."
3,Sony icd-mx20,"product was better than expected. however, i was told that there would be software to convert the voice files to a file that can be used on the computer or by a transcriber. that wa not present and i had a difficult time finding one, i have not yet found a solution. so while the product is great, it leave out one important part which renders it only 3 stars."
1,"A disgrace to sony, here's why in point form","-small button size-recording time is crap when used with the best batteries-hold button, many bugs with-bugs; files often end corrupt in various ways, meaning you get f***ed over-software is crap, also it cant convert to mp3, o and did i mention you have to convert in general not true for all ic recorders, which others record directly in mp3 for example-mic is without noice reduction-device is the most fragile ic recorder ever-a consumer grade product, not a professional grade productGo with the following: ds-2200 made by olympus, it smokes this ic recorder by a mile, and its tough and goes for about the same price perhaps cheaper."
2,Device great but don't buy if you only have Macintosh,"The device is great, audio quality and features fine, but their proprietary audio format and lack of ANY Macintosh software that can read it is infuriating. Fortunately I use boot camp but it is a pain. Sony should give you the option to recording uncompressed WAV or AIF, and not just their lousy MSV format. I knew before the purchase that the software they provide was not Mac compatible, but didn't know that the audio could not be read by ANY Mac software. Sony, get your act together."
2,Unbelievably Difficult to Use,"Technical devices are usually easy for me to navigate. That is until I met the Sony ICD-MX20. It is unbelievable! I have now owned this device for 3 months, have made multiple efforts to read the incomprehensible instructions that came with the recorder, and am now looking for a replacement. It is hard to comment on all the great features every one comments upon when it is not possible to get to first base! This product is only for super techies. Normal people should look elsewhere."
1,Controls are very poorly designed.,"Don't buy this, the Navigation/control button in the center is extremely fragile and the device will be useless. The button operates like a joystick but also most of the functions of the device have to be manipulated through this tiny button. It is cumbersome to operate and not well made. I am very gentle with electronics (been building my own pc's for over 20 years) but I bought it online without ""test driving"" it. That button in the middle is going to break with mediocre usage and you'll end up like me a very disappointed customer. Trying to get it replaced is a nightmare and as a result I will never purchase anything from sony ever again. As of now it is sitting in my closet useless and sony refused to replace it with a new one. I will never accept a refurbished product as a replacement for a brand new defective item period. Sony refused to give me a new one. Go with another product."
3,Won't Sync with Naturally Speaking if You Have Vista,"The recorder itself is excellent. Just be aware, though, that a compatibility problem with Vista will prevent you from training a user profile for the recorder in Naturally Speaking 10:[...]There is a work-around for now. Hopefully, the problem will be resolved fully before long -- maybe just in time for a new round of problems under Windows 7. :)"
3,"South of the border,down Mexico Way!",What a gem comedy/drama this film is! The story concerns Margo hilariously portrayed by Margot Kidder arriving in Mexico to see ailing father whom soon dies not long after but not before telling her of a stolen treasure in a ghost-town buried years beore. Along the way Margo hitches up with Eugene played by Ted Danson performed wonderfully in the part. The two set off into adventure holding down jobs in small towns she a proffessional-stripper and he as bartender tests their romantic-relationship as on their weekends they search for the buried Treasure and conflict ensues as he wonders whether the Treasure was just the old man's delusion and she never giving-up the promise of her fathers buried fortune. In the end they may find the treasure or the greatest of them all love.
5,Wow,"I just recently finished the book, and right after i set it down beside me, i said ""Wow"". Before i continue to praise this book, there is one thing. Its outdated, a bit. The last week of the marines now, is the Crucible, not (i forget what it says in the book) and other things here and there. Other than that, this a a great book, great content, superb story, interviews, pictures, its the Michael Jordan of books."
4,Will bring it all home again,"I purchased this book, just to see how boot camp has changed over the years. It has, but it's still tough and it should be. Semper FiAnd My Mother Danced with Chesty Puller: Adventures of a Marine in the rear, to combat in Vietnam"
4,Good book but blinded by bias.,"Though I thoroughly enjoyed the book, I wished the author didn't spend so much time bashing the Army. As a former (and still at heart) Infantryman, I resent the broad brush painting of Army basic training. In the end, EVERY member of the armed forces does their job to put troops (be it Army infantry/armor or Marine infantry/armor) on the objective to take and hold ground. US Army Infantry OSUT -- One Station Unit Training -- at the Benning School for Boys (Ft. Benning) is nearly identical to US Marine training (save for the Marines calling the ground the ""deck"") and builds the same Esprit de Corps. Otherwise, good book."
5,Making the Corps,Book was received timely and in the condition advertised. I would use this supplier again.R. E. Collier
5,A very good preparation for a future USMC recruit.,"From the moment I began this book, I couldn't put it down. Gave such an inspiration for this future recruit. A definate read for anyone thinking of joining the military."
5,A well-written look at the Marines of the mid-1990's,"I enjoyed reading this book and the picture it gives of Marine Corps Boot Camp and Marine Corps culture and what makes it tick. I only wish the author would do an update, a ten-year later kind of work to see what happened to those Marines. That would be interesting. Reading this, it made me think there is a probabably a great need for the Marines far beyond their military role (""The US doessn't need a Marine Corps, it wants one!"") simply because the US would not be the same without one.I liked all the Marine Corps reading list references and the men who helped reshape the Marines in in the 1980's and 1990's."
3,good book,"Chapter nine appears as if it were written about the military in 1972, as it was exactly the same except perhaps we actually hated civilians, not merely despised them back then. Sadly when I think of Marines, I always think of an episode in 1969 when I watched 12 marines die by enemy machine gun fire because marines don't use artillery or gunships on ""only one bunker"". We silenced the bunker with the rockets from our gunship but we were not allowed to do it until 12 boys died crossing an open rice paddy trying to take it like real marines."
3,worth reading,"This book gave an interesting account of several Marine recruits' trials of boot camp. I thought this book started off great and then sputtered out in the end. Too much politically/military theory in the final chapters make this book come to a grinding halt. Otherwise, I would still recommend this to anybody interested in boot camp, Marines, or the military in general."
3,Three month review,"Look...Ricks attempted to give the Corps more respect yet what we all must understand is that he is/was a journalist and would not bite the hand that feeds him (the military allowing him to actual write a story about a sacred place) by divulging all that happens and all that these men see in MCRD training. With that in mind, it is a good outline for delayed entry recruits or the parents of Marines to gain a little understanding. I would though suggest to get a net overview of the next four years a Marine will face, learn from and be guided by when he becomes a civilian once again is the book by P. Chadz."
1,"T.E.Ricks used bar stool research for ""Making the Corps""","Just from excerpts, I know Ricks poorlyresearched his material. Quoting him, herefers to Marine recruits ""mopping floors"".Marines do not ""mop floors""; they ""swabdecks"".I think Ricks spent most of his time at thebar in the Bachelor Officers' Quarters withan occasional VIP tour of the enlisted men'sbarracks.The above is just one example of hissecond-hand research but suffices to convinceme the author is a poor observer of the realglory behind the making of a U.S. Marine."
2,Disappointing.,I expected another book about going through boot camp which this covered only slightly. Mostly it was a revealing picture of the main character and his thoughts. I would like to be more specific but I do not do well on book reviews. If you want to read about the Corps this is not the book.
3,"Beanstalk,timely for the ECO-System.","Hey this is a fun-filled fantasy film with THX Mastered Sound, An enjoyous-romp for the little one's and the grown-up's. Good production value's and music score nice acting turn's by veteran's David(American Werewolf in London)Naughton,Richard Moll(TVs Night Court) and zany wacky scientist played by Margot Kidder(Lois Lane of Superman,movies)least of all the child-actor known as Jack,after the Beanstalk,RECOMMENDED FAMILY VIEWING!"
4,Crutches,"I used the standard crutches from the hospital for about 2 weeks before getting these. These have a much better fit for the hand grips and the large underarm support doesn't slip out when I'm wearing my backpack like the others.If you're a larger person, like me, be prepared to replace the bolts for the handles. They way they setup them up with the washers between the crutches and handle put too much strain on the bolt and for me it broke after about 3 weeks.They are also louder than normal crutches. The spring shocks are good when you're moving out in the open, like crossing parking lots, but are a little annoying around the house at first.I haven't used the folding part too much, so I don't have a useful opinion on that.Overall the pluses outweigh the minuses by a lot."
1,not worth it,"the tarpeez is the worst item I ever bough.In 5 hours of driving at 65 miles per hour the tarp flapped it'sself to shreds.Almost as bad as the cheap blue tarps..I was very disapointed in it..Maybe at slower speeds it would have been fine.As far as putting in on the truck,it was easy...I would not recommend to anyone.."
2,Product Failed,"I liked the basic design. Followed all the instructions. The fabric is good. The bungee is good. The problem is the fabric cut the bungee. If there was some sort of protection for the bungee, such as a large smooth grommet, it would be great. I removed it before it completely failed and returned it for a refund."
5,This product is very good.,"We have been using this Tarpeez for several years. We are still using the original one we bought several years ago. Although it shows some wear, it has held up remarkably well. We've been wanting to get a second one, just to have it on hand since we rely on it so much. We've been looking for one for a couple of years, and were very happy when this supplier got one in stock. They shipped it very promptly, we got it quickly, and it was exactly what we ordered. Very good product and supplier."
1,Crap Quality,"This product is made of nylon, and tears very easy. The fitment of the clips are not great, as they do not hook on all types of tie downs. You have to hook them the the inside lip of the wheel well and bumper. I have a 6.5 ft bed and it did not cover all of it because it constantly wants to pull to one side or another. If you need something quick and temporary this is good, other than that its not worth it. Mine only lasted a couple of weeks."
4,Makita Cordless Drill Standards,Well I give it 4 stars for the following reasons: 1. Delivery on time 2. Very Light in weight but powerfull 3. I haven't used it much so that's why 4 and not 5.
3,good but could be better,"There is a wealth of information in this book for estimating for designers or decorators (often the big distinction between the two amounts to the amount of money and time spent on an education, not in practice!). My biggest complaint with this book is that it is not really set up as an easy quick reference. I can get quicker info on the internet."
3,the fabric and the fabrication,"Learn for yourself the secret formulas to determine how much material and what it will cost for that exotic carpet, exuberant wallpaper or snazzy fabric that would look as good on your windows as on your so-custom pillows. I always wanted to know and now I do know the basics of determining how to measure and what it means to do your own estimating for costs of goods and services in the design world.The text is straight-forward and thorough---but not completely without fault as I detected proofreading errors in spelling and some mathematical miscalculations. This is first and foremost a primer and introduction to the art of calculating carpet, wallpaper, upholstery and paint estimation."
4,a must have for Interior Designers,I bought this book for an Interior Design class and have kept it. It is a great book for giving estimates for all amounts of products you may need for any design product!
4,Tim Kazurinsky Makes This Moive,"Tim Kazurinsky demonstrates his range and makes this movie worth buying. I am going to see what other moives Tim has performed in and buy them too.JimVienna, VA"
3,D*#n Yankees,"As a lifelong student of America's Civil War, I turned to Reasoner's fictional series with interest because of its Confederate perspective. The ninth volume, Savannah, covers the months during which Sherman took the fight to Georgia and began the systematic shattering of the rebel army. My hope was that this book would be as compelling as Michael Shaara's The Killer Angels, but it lacks the sense of urgent immediacy in which Shaara so successfully plunged his readers. Reasoner's story, from both the military and the civilian angle, is accurate enough historically, and should be compelling. Unfortunately, his writing style, relying as it does upon stock phrases (e.g., ""it was all he could do"" or ""all he could think about was..."") and elementary vocabulary, falls flat even in the most exciting of settings. Similarly, most of his characters come across as a bit wooden. Recommended for young adult readers and those seeking an introduction to the war between the states."
4,Love it!,"I love this book. It's a great collection of contemporary writing. There are three prompts per genre and it doesn't include drama. I love the balance between the fiction, nonfiction, poetry and experimental writing. There is also a section of writing on writing. My students of Intro to Creative Writing love it. My only problem with the book is that it doesn't have any craft information. I have to provide all craft information to my students through lecture. I wish that this book had a small nuts and bolts section of important info about each genre. In my opinion, that's all it's missing."
3,3.5 Stars seems more accurate,"el-p has always been a personal favorite of mine going back to the rawkus days with end to end burners. fan-dam was so sick and in my opinion destroys this one. that said, his complex beat making and off kilter flow is still fun to listen to and if you have any doubts on making this purchase, fear not."
5,masterpiece,"i heard fantastic damage first from el-p, and it was great. but this is something else. every song has so much energy and el-p is well worth listening to. DeF jUx"
5,Absolutely Phenomenal,"This album is one of the finest works of art that I have ever laid my senses upon. I have been a fan of El-Producto since the co-flow days; and I must say that he has just now become my favorite emcee. Call it ""indie"", ""backpacker"", ""prog rap"" or whatever you want; when you sit down to listen to this album, you will inevitably come to the recognition that any silly little name you try to apply to it is absolutely inadaquate. Merely an attempt to describe something that just blew your mind.""They don't get my whole existence, an actual b-boy braniac that'l slap you out your mittens."" -El-P Smithereens"
5,Stepping it up,"I like underground/indie hip-hop, but I never really got the hang ofFantastic Damage. I was okay withHigh Water, and could imagine liking El-P, and now with this album, I do.I'm not going to do a a track-by-track, but I like nearly all of them. If you like indie hip-hop, this is a no-brainer. If you're not sure, this is not a bad introduction to the genre."
4,Really fun book,"This book gives you step-by-step instructions on how to make all kinds of whimsical sushi dishes. It's as much fun to look at the pictures as to actually make the recipes. However, it's best if you live near a Japanese grocery, as a lot of the ingredients probably aren't at your local supermarket."
5,Creative colorful tasty sushi ideas!,"Amazingly colorful and decorative sushi ideas that are fun for parties and family gatherings. Full color photos telling you how to make the seasoned sushi rice then how to create the fancy sushi rolls. There are ideas for almost every holiday that you can do for your family such as Santa Claus sushi. There are ideas for the different seasons spring, summer, winter, fall. Lots of cute ideas for kids such as the Panda-Maki. Well worth the money to buy this book I highly recommend it! :)"
4,Love my VZW Audiovox 6600,"Got mine 3 weeks ago. Love it. I am not a high call volume person, though. If I was, this device would not do it.PLUSSESEVDO internet is fast. (I can get to sites that are blocked by my employer network). Sync with desktop works fine. Enough storage, phone is okay. All MS outlook functions there. Free voice dialer from handango works okay.MINUSESPower must have extra battery and perform nightly charge.Phone numbers not recognized in any non-contact format.Slow MS-Bill Gates- tick tock wait for aps to come up"
1,Don't Do It,We purchased around 10 of these. All fail regularly. Not a durable or quality product regardless of the features - ESPECIALLY for the price.
3,Poor Battery Life on XV6600,"I'm returning my XV6600 today. As a PDA, it has plenty of nice features...Pocket PC is great, and the compatibility with Windows applications is nice. HOWEVER, as a primary phone, it leaves a lot to be desired. The battery life is awful. I charged it to full capacity, and less than 10 hours later, it was at 33% only from a few phone calls. I wish I would have read these reviews before making such a pricy purchase!"
2,The bane of my existence,"This phone it the bane of my existence. I urge anybody in the market for the xv6600 to please listen to my experiences and make your decision accordingly. I have created a list of minimum expectations of PDA's in general which anybody, regardless of the device they are looking for, should make sure their investment meets in order for it to bring the functionality and reliability you really do need. The rest of my review is available athttp://johnpatota.com/xv6600.htm"
3,Bluetooth?,"I'm looking to see if anyone has any possible advice or suggestions on a Bluetooth headset? I currently have tried the Motorola HS820 & Motorola HS850 (while the volume sounds perfect to whoever you are calling, you can't really hear anything on both of these). Do Not Buy Motorola Bluetooth Headsets for this phone! I have tried the Jabra 250 which gives you perfect sound due to the eargel being inserted in your ear. However, you almost have to keep the phone and the headset right in front of each other to prevent static. Can anyone help me? I was thinking of going with Plantronics or Sony Ericson. Any Advice or suggestions?"
1,junk paper,"This is absolutely no laser photo paper. Better quality on regular paper. I tried once, I tried twice, the same bad result."
2,prints blurry will not be able to use it,prints blurry will not be able to use the paper it was a waste of my money
5,Great color laser photo paper - check hp site for deals***,You have to use this paper for printing photos on your color laser printer. I tried the matte finish and it just doesn't look as nice (though it's really not too bad). Just got buy one get one with free next business day shipping on the hp website.
5,"Good Paper for Laser Color, Neg. Reviews Incorrect","Very good paper. Those who say it smears did not change their print properties to ""glossy presentation style"". The default paper is for regular plain paper. If you don't change this, the toner will smear from the printer wheels. If you change your print properties to glossy, no problems as the printer will heat and set the toner differently. All the best! BW"
5,Exactly what I was looking for,Couldn't find laser photo paper locally. This allows me to print glossy photos from my color laser that look as good as or maybe a little better than my photo-inkjet printer. Fast shipping too.
1,.Very bad news! Don;t try this paper,This paper in the HP CP1518 created the worst mess I have ever seen put out by a printer. I had to replace a $60 black cartrige. For a while I thought the printer was destroyed. I bought this printer with the intention of printing glossy photos. WRONG!!!
2,"Caveat for Xerox Phaser owners, did not work for me","In my case, this product would barely deserve 1 star, I just did not down rate it too much because I suspect it might have just been incompatible with my printer.I tried it on my Xerox Phaser 6130 (an, otherwise, superb printer).The paper is advertised as general use for laser printers but it definitely does not work with this line of Xerox printers.I run only two prints and in both occasions the toner detached from the paper, I got concerned that the printer might have been damaged. After running several blank sheets of plain paper all the leftover toner cleared from the paper path and the printer seems to be working fine.My recommendation, before you buy contact HP or your printer manufacturer or both and inquire about compatibility, that is the safest way to go."
2,Buy this book (for your poker buddies),"This book has a wealth of information on low stakes poker variations, but little on how to win. The rules are a little subjective for ""according to Hoyle"", especially if you've been playing a while. If you need something to spice up your low stakes game or are constantly being confused about the variations your partners are springing on you, this book is fine. But I would steer clear, and buy ""Thurs. Night Poker"" by Steiner instead. It will help your game infinitely more. ""The Rules of Neighborhood Poker"" is basic enough that I would give it as a gift to a poker buddy, knowing that it would add nothing to his game except his readiness to play."
1,Horrible...,"We bought this to keep around to settle our minor disputes over rules, and for most of the game information I guess it's not too bad. I mainly got it because I thought it was an ""official"" handbook, which it is anything but. But I would highly recommend that you don't waste your money on this one. Spend the extra cash and get something a little better. If you want to play poker that is, because what this guy talks about is NOT poker. Any game that doesn't involve 600 wild cards is, in his words, ""boring.""Plus, if you play cards like he says in his scenarios you might get the crap beat out of you. Almost all of the dialogue involves string betting...and a lot of the other ""etiquette"" rules are also a bit off. So if you want to know some of the basics and how to play improperly...go ahead and get this one."
4,"Terrific, relaxed version for serious amateurs","I bought this book as a resource and reference for some of my rule-challenging poker pals, but it turned out to be much more than that. The stories that Wolpin tells are laugh out loud funny, and he provides alot of basic information on the rules of Poker and variations on the game."
3,"Amateur-ish built, good for rare pictures","The HTML interface has a unmistakable homemade look, and the info could be better organized, but it is a valuable off-line source of rare computer photos, specially if you like old big iron like ENIAC, EDVAC, UNIVAC and so on. Most of the stuff can be obtained from the Internet with a bit of research, though. Not bad, but I bit disappointing."
3,Cute but small,Very cute graphics printed on front but overall size seems quite small for an adult. Would probably be better for a child.
1,Great movie. Disappointing Book.,"The movie is definitely a great addition to any film collection, the book not so much. I was hoping to read the story behind the movie, thinking it would be larger with expanded background, greater plot, additional motivation, etc... Not so. The book is basically the screenplay, a printed version of the movie with the same scenes, same characters, and same dialog. So what's the point? Buy or rent the movie, you won't be disappointed. The book is supurfluous. rdp"
5,This book wins my heart,The Hellion Bride is the second book in Bride Series. I love Ryder and Sophie and the joy of meeting other characters from The Sherbrooke Bride. I kept turning the pages to find out their secrets. Deceptive and abusive uncle Theo as well as murder scenes make the story more thrilling and a suspense. The Virgin Bride also comes in handy and she is an angel rather than a ghost for she always is encouraging and very nice. Sinjun pleasantly spices up the whole story. I can't wait any longer to read her own story The Heiress Bride.
3,"Second in the series, third best","Although Ryder Sherbrooke was by far the sexiest of the heros in the Bride trilogy, the story was not as good as Sherbrooke Bride and Heiress Bride. His arrogance with women is overshadowed by his love for children, so that was a nice mixture in a personality."
1,The worst book I've ever read,"I'm not going to offend the person with nickname ""Darling"". But I'm sorry for you, Darling, because you've probably had a little opportunity to read quite excellent books. Abundant porno scenes and discussion of physiological problems never can save the novel when the plot is thin and heroes are grotesque and caricatured. Indeed, terrible, violent uncle who abuses sweet and proud virgin-heroine and her poor little brother. Then He appears, he is not only the lover-hero but even Treasure, who is ready to make happy any female he met on his way!..(I can't stop laughing). No more than naivety...)"
3,Marital Rape?,"Having read this book, I do not know what everyone is talking about with the marital rape. Do not get me wrong, I thought some of the sex scenes were conducted with force. However, it seemed that the scenes were put in context with the wrongness of the act. He wanted his wife to learn how to feel pleasure with him, but he actually did feel remorse for any force he used. You want to read a Coulter book with real marital rape? Read Midsummer Magic, Rosehaven and Calypso Magic. And the ""heros in this book did not feel an ounce of remorce for what they did because, in their opinion, they were trying to teach their wives that is was their place to submit. Now those books have the real thing. This was a cute book, but I have come to the opinion that Coulter is not a talented writer. If you want to read a really good historical romance, read Christina Dodd's Treasure Of The Sun. I guarantee you will be converted."
4,No simpering miss here,"I liked Sophie. She was abused by an uncle that used her for his own gain and still had backbone. She had issues with trust, which is understandable, but no simpering miss here. Ryder has a huge heart but hides it with his rakish persona. He doesn't want anyone knowing the truth, not even his family. When they marry, Sophie learns his secret and I think that is one thing that brought her into trusting again. This is a story of betrayal, pain, and the love that comes to them both as they learn to trust."
2,Sherbrooke Bride outshines this one by a mile.,"I loved Sherbrooke Bride. I felt Ryder deserved an equally fascinating heroine and storyline. Instead the characters are flat, one dimensional drones. Sophie, the heroine is useless. The plot was thin and Coulter, obviously struggling for ideas, just fluffed most of the chapters with nonsense. I get the feeling she was in a rush to complete the trilogy and her heart and usual talent did not surface with this piece of writing. YUK. I'm generously giving her two stars because overall I enjoy this author. I couldn't wait for Hellion to end and had to struggle to finish it. Usually her pace is great and her novels are page turners. Disappointing."
1,Barbaric..........,"This is the second disturbing book I have read by Coulter. Her novels seem to be riddled with abuse; both mental and physical.If you're looking for a fairytale romance or any romance at all skip this book. This book was about an Englishman who goes to the Carribean to investigate ghosts/spirits haunting his brother's property. That storyline flatlines and instead Coulter focuses on this odd, completely disturbed, man-hating young lady that is forced to wed the Englishman for her own protection. That sounds heroic, but trust me it's not.There is absolutely nothing in this novel that makes you want to keep reading further."
3,What to say?,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I found it disturbing, not that I believed that the heroine was by any means 'raped', that is verging on the ridiculous, it was merely a painful first experience for her, no force whatsoever. What disturbs me is the fact that Sophie had an insane fear of men and the marital act.In the beginning, Sophie played her seductress role quite convincingly, she was vibrant, retortful, but suddenly after her 'rescue' she becamesa meek mouse type person, with absolutely no personality or 'fire' to speak of.While the story flowed smoothly, and the hero Ryder is quite captivating as the 'knight in shining armor', there wasn't any chemistry between the two characters. Their moods switched off and on like lamp switches. I also would really like to understand why Ms. Coulter finds it always necessary to have her heroines abused and always fearing the opposite sex.The story is good and it is interesting if you like Coulter's work. This is basically classic Coulter."
3,Ok for emergency,These are very light weight and not very sturdy. They will do in a pinch for example if your car breaks down in the rain they will be a welcome item. I recommend them for one time or limited use but that is it. Not bad for the price.
3,1 Poncho,"Careful. It is only 1 Poncho. Maybe I was intoxicated when I placed my order, but I was hoping for 3. Honestly, you'll get more bang for your buck getting a package of cheap disposable ones unless you are on an extended trip."
1,BAD VALUE!!!!,it was damaged when arrived. its basically a trash bag which cost 5 bucks. took forever to arrive too. WASTE!
3,Makes tub/shower VERY slippery!,"It's a very nice scrub, very invigorating and my feet felt great. But, the wonderful essential oils spread themselves all over the tub, and it was slippery for days, even after much scrubbing with cleanser! Just be aware to be careful after using it."
3,Back in the day,"Well, since this movie was made back in the day, it was alright for that time, but now noone would think so. The actors did a good job, but there could have been more to the movie. After watching it, it felt just like another Saturday afternoon movie. If there were more drama and action and more to the story it probably would have made it to DVD. I love Michael Madsen and I think he is a cool actor so this is what prompted me to buy this movie."
4,Good,"I brought this because I saw a chinese medicine vedio saying rose hip will help reduce stress level. It tastes pretty neutrel, so don't need to be worried it will have a strange taste that might not fit everybody."
1,Subscription Customers Beware!,"Initial shipment with this tea was of good quality, but after that I got the tea with bad smell and taste. I checked an expiration date. It's been over 3 years already (June 12/2006). Amazon has returned my money but stated that they would not guarantee the quality of this product and would not replace it(???)."
5,Persuasion - a beautiful understatement,"This wonderful adaption shows what it is like to be different to those around you, and to be persuaded to take life in a direction you regret. Finally, true friendships, love and understanding burst through. Filming is on location in some cases, and beautifully - if understatedly - photographed, with some hand-held shots illustrating uncomfortable surroundings. Acting is excellent. The music is appropriate and not obtrusive."
4,True to the spirit of the book,"Out of the recent film adaptations of the Jane Austen's novellas, this one tops them all. It's not to be compared to BBC's Pride and Prejudice as that's not a film. But when compared to Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility, Gwenyth Paltrow's Emma and Francis O'Conner in Mansfield Park, this film adaptation of 'Persuasion' is my favourite.I found it difficult to accept the actress as Anne at first, butshe does grow on you. I found this film exquisite and true to the spirit of the novel. This version delivers in quality above all the rest."
1,Boring,"I tried my best to watch this movie, but was bored to pieces. Maybe it might have something good about it if I could have stayed awake to finish it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. People who give this good reviews must lead a very boring life. I really thought I would like it, but forget this one."
3,Difficult to understand,Persuasion is a beautifully filmed period movie. The british actors were at times difficult to understand. People whispered and then spoke loudly. It was sometimes hard to decipher the British accented dialogue. Worth watching for the costumes and scenery.
2,Not a very good movie to watch....,I haven't read the book but this movie is not very well presented. A very poor adaptation of the said movie with very lousy actors and actresses portraying their roles. Rent the movie for viewing. Not worth owning it.
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen.,"I love Jane Austen. I love period movies. Ciaran Hinds and Fiona Shaw are great actors. But none of this can save the wooden performances and terrible directing in this movie. The cast has no chemistry. The lines are delivered with all the life of a plank. The constant sloppy eating is hard to watch as are all the cast, with the cinematographer showing them in the most unattractive way possible. The score is entirely forgettable. 104 minutes of my life I will never get back."
2,Sorely disappointed,"This was one of the most boring and tedious videos I have ever seen. I agree with Leonard Maltin that the film ""demands patience."" The two lovers showed very little passion. Root had almost the same expression on her face throughout the whole story. The actors spent more time eating than talking. And there was an overall feeling of heaviness. The book is far better than the movie. The only good thing about the movie was the scenery, and so I give it 2 stars."
5,Watch with a tissue handy,"Perfect casting, costuming and sets. Looks expensive. Ciaran Hinds is so good in this. He looks like the perfect sea captain that the ladies would love. No overly handsome ""pretty boy"" could play this role. Amanda Root looks a little wild-eyed most of the movie but she plays her role with tenderness. I love that the star crossed lovers get another chance and the ending is beautiful."
5,Superb,"This one caught me by surprise. At first, I thought it was too slow, and I began to lose patience with it. But I continued watching, and was so excited with how the plot developed. If you're a fan of English 19th century social structure type of movies, this one will work for you. Even if you've not read Jane Austen's book, the movie tells the story very well."
3,Someone To 'Root' For!,"Being a Jane Austen novel (this edition brought to the screen courtesy the BBC), you know it's primarily a chick flick, a romance novel with old English spoken, very nicely photographed with nice period sets and scenery and some interesting women to view.What's different about this is the leading actress: Amanda Root, who plays ""Anne Elliot."" In America, this is not a lady whom we are familiar with, so she was a new ""face"" for me, as well. I liked her. I've heard criticism of her looks. You don't have to be glamorous to be accepted as a fine female actor. She was excellent in her role and just the looks on her face, particularly the sad looks, spoke more ""volumes"" than any dialog could manage."
5,Persuasion Review,This movie is exactly the version my mom loves. I ordered it for her birthday and she loved it! Thanks!! :-)
5,Jane Austen fan,The wife only watched this movie once and then switched back over to watching Pride and Prejudice. I'm sure she enjoyed it though and will soon go on a Persuasion kick and watch this movie repeatedly. It just hasn't happened yet.
4,An excellent movie!,"Persuasion is my favorite Austin book, and this movie does an excellent job of bringing the characters to life. Amanda Root does a persuasive job as Anne. My only complaint is how the infamous letter from Captian Wentworth (""You pierce my soul"") is read by both voices. I thought that detracted from the climax. But well worth repeated watchings anyway."
4,A film that improves with repeated viewings,"The first time I watched this film, I had trouble following the story and catching the words that were so often mumbled. However, when I reached the end, I immediately rewound the tape and watched the first half a second time in order to better appreciate the fine production and story that this is. Each time I watch it, it improves.This movie lead me to read the book. I am delighted that the movie contains so many direct quotes, and depicts the book's characters so well.This movie also lead me to become a Jane Austen fan. I have read nearly all of her published writings, read a few of her biographies, and watched all of the films. This one remains one of my favorite Jane Austen movies."
5,Persuasion (1995 version),"I just kept my video on while doing some desk chores beside the television, when I found myself coming to be involved in the movie on the screen. I put my deskwork aside and began seriously watching the very beautiful portrayal of things English of some 200 years ago.The heroine, played by Amanda Root, didn't appear so attractive in the beginning. I found her rather homely at first. By and by, however, she began to look attractive and even beautiful as the picture evolved.It is indeed as excellent a period picture as Sense and Sensibility of 1996."
4,Gentle and persuasive,"As the book Persuasion differs from the book P&P; so do the two films and this is no criticism: simply stating a fact. They differ because they concentrate on different characters. As Elizabeth is lively and energetic so is Anne gentle and charming. One is not better than the other: only different.Although I don't think Persuasion is as charismatic as P&P;, it is still very well done. Amanda Root represents Anne's qualities very charmingly and Ciarán Hinds is very masculine, but gentle at the same time.Concerning the other characters I imagined Elizabeth would be more attractive (externally!) as it is so often emphasized in the book and Mr Elliot would be more mature: the actor seemed to me a bit young to add real weight and interest to this character.Costumes, music, landcapes were also very well suited to the atmosphere of this film of great quality.I recommend it to JA and costume drama fans."
5,Just defending one of my favorite movies,"This ""review"" is coming from a person who doesn't usually write reviews, but I was flipping through the section for this movie and was struck by some extremely negative reactions.This movie is amazing... Amanda Root is amazing, her portrayal of Anne is touching, as her character is able to develop throughout the film. It is presented very well; characters are real, their various motivations human and real, which all add to make a colorful, beautiful movie.I am not recommending ""Persuasion"" to everyone: one must be extremely patient, as the plot ambles along at its own pace. However, for those who appreciate richness in story telling and charming characters, this movie is amazing. Enjoy!"
5,Superbly Done,"Simply well coordinated,perfectly casted,well acted,as dignified as the book.It`s a five stars all around. Job well done!!!"
2,Not up to standards,"While I absolutely love the book (I am a huge Jane Austen fan), and I love watching other movies based on her books, this book was just not up to standards. The acting is rather weak, as is the production, and it tends to be rather boring... I've watched it a total of 3 times, twice i didn't watch it all the way through. The characters are not well portrayed at all, and through the movie they seem way too weak and whimpy... I was rather disappointed with this as I don't believe there are any good productions of Persuasion."
5,Persuade yourself to finally stop renting it & buy the movie,"From Mr. Rochester to a professor in ""Circle of Friends,"" Ciaran Hinds finally gets a role that is truly spectacular! ""Persuasion"" is a wonderful movie that will not disappoint any Jane Austen aficionado. It is worthy of a space on your self next to A&E's ""Pride and Prejudice."""
1,Hard to watch...the actors were very homely,"Did anyone else find the movie hard to watch because the actors and actresses were exceedingly homely in this movie? A little bit of make-up would of been nice. Amanda Root is okay, but definitely needs some fine tuning for the big screen. For me personally, the unattractive actors detracted from the story.Also, hard to detect any feelings or chemistry between the two main characters. Besides looking at each other occasionally, and Amanda's character looking like a deer in headlights almost the whole time...very annoying..there was no chemistry on screen between the two. No established chemistry = bad, dull movie.Anyway, not worth buying as I did, rent it, because at least then you won't be stuck with it. Sorry to be so harsh, but there it is."
1,YUK!,"I love Jane Austen... read her books over and over. Appreciate almost every attempt to portray her genius on film. But this dark, wimpy, portrayal is an insult. The perfect Anne Elliott of the novel smiles only twice in this entire film, the rest of the time walks around with a 'deer-in-the-headlights'-with- depression look- this is not the admired, strong, smart, persevering Anne it should have been... the novel makes you want to copy Anne- this film makes you want to run! Yuk! The old BBC version is so much closer to the real story, and the characters perfect. This version is not worth borrowing for free from a friend!"
1,Boring,I watched the earlier version of this movie and was not too pleased with it. Now I have watched this version on DVD and find the actors and progression of the movie to be even duller. Anne looks all the way through as though she were a bewildered child who had just left an orphanage. I loved Emma and Sense & Sensibility and was sorely disappointed in this one.
4,"Starts slow, then grows on you","I watched this movie before I read Jane Austen's ""Persuasion"". When I first watched it, it seemed extremely slow -- nothing was happening! Towards the ending things got better, but I wasn't that impressed.Then I bought the book and read it. From a strict movie entertainment level from the first viewing, I would give this film 3 stars. However, from its capturing of the essense of the book, it deserves 5 stars. Upon first watching it, I was confused by Amanda Root, who isn't that attractive but gets the handsome Captain Wentworth at the end. However, I see that this reflects the book, where Anne has lost her bloom and is thus not as beautiful as she once was, but the strength of character and true love between the two wins out.The other reviewers here were right -- this movie gets better and better upon watching it multiple times. It's a very quiet movie in a way, but full of gentle nuances that are really quite powerful once you get into that mindset."
4,Good adaptation of Jane Austen novel,"I thought it was a good retelling of Jane Austen book. Movie did not have detail or emotion of book, but Austen fans should still enjoy."
4,Great movie,"If you are a Jane Austen fan, this movie is a must-have for your collection. Great storyline. The dvd arrived on time and in good condition."
4,Persuasion...DVD,Video works fine - BUT arrived in busted box. Was in a padded brown mailing envelope. Please take not that for the future.
4,Very much a movie of manners,"Very Regency - very Austen but oh, does it grow on you. I am delighted with it each time that I see it - Ann's father's sneers have to be the best that ever made it onto film! Yes, it is slow. Yes, you have to pay attention to it. The charm is in the details of the expressions and tones of voices. Still - I had 10 convicted male felons watch it without moving from their seats until the the very end last Tuesday - and it generated a very lively discussion on propriety, the British Navy and how women's lives have changed. That isn't something too many movies do!"
2,Difficult to follow,"The first time I saw this film I really struggled to follow all the characters. So, I watched it a second time. The beginning seems dark, and poor Anne is depicted as so meek and lonely with her sisters such jerks. Of course, her sisters were jerks. I really did not like the casting of Frederick Wentworth at all. He seemed too old and too weathered to play any sort of romantic lead. I just could not get into the romance between Anne and Frederick. So, I read the book because a friend told me it was such a wonderful story. I enjoyed the book, so decided to watch this film again. But, alas, it still seems too gloomy and not very romantic at all. I am surprised that so many enjoyed this version."
5,A gorgeous film,"Even though I've read all of Austen's novels and knew what was going to happen, this film kept me engrossed. The actors truly became the characters of Austen's facinating novel. I found myself actually disliking Anne's family and rooting for Ann and Wentworth to overcome all the obstacles to their romance. This film is well worth owning."
3,"An unfortunately lackluster, spiritless production","Persuasion is by no means Jane Austen's most interesting book, but does it have to be so deadly dull? Amanda Root does her best with what she's given to work with, but she generally comes across as a ""poor little match girl"" type with an annoying hang-dog expression. We never get a glimpse of what could provoke Capt. Wentworth's passion. Her sister Elizabeth is nothing more than a charicature, though the potrayal of her sister Mary is quite good. The movie is too short to develop any of the secondary stories, so that certain plot lines and characters are just stuck into the main story and go nowhere."
3,Not Persuaded by the film,"Glad I read the book before watching the film. There were scenes from the book that could have been included to make the film story line flow better. The actors/actresses were not as believable and didn't seem to fit the descriptions in the book as well. This adaptation of ""Persuasion"" was not as good as Ang Lee's ""Sense and Sensibility"" (with Emma Thompson) nor Andrew Davies' ""Pride and Prejudice"" (with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle).If you're not keen on owning this DVD, I'd borrow it from the local library, a friend, or NetFlix before spending money to buy it."
2,Hard to get into.,"I love Jane Austen's works, and Persuasion, for me, comes next in line after Pride and Prejudice. I think the story is more gentle and you really see a transformation in Anne. The movie, however, I just didn't like. The characters weren't portrayed well and I thought the movie was boring. Anne in the movie had pretty much the same look on her face the whole movie which drove me nuts. The guy who played Capt. Wentworth i thought was too angry most of the time. I really couldn't enjoy this film because I couldn't get over the bad acting. I'd love to see Persuasion redone with hopefully a better result. My advice: read the book and skip the movie."
2,"Don't bother, wait for the next version!","I thought the lead woman did a terrible, wooden portrayal of Anne and was mis-cast for this part. It was the only time I really didn't want the hero to ""get the girl"", she wasnt' worth getting. Her young sailor was wonderful, but there was no evident love or sensual tension between them. It made the ending abrupt and unbelievable. It was also filmed very darkly, literally, not figuratively. But rather than being moody and setting period ambiance, many of the scenes were just dark - making the characters hard to see. This was annoying.I hope someone attempts this script again, only with a new lead woman, better lighting and with more visible tension between the leads to make their love story believable. This copy went to the Good Will."
1,Totally NOT worth the time,"Based on all the excellent reviews I bought this film... I love a good love story but this one is the worst I've ever seen. For one, the camera work is at times odd (jumping about, unsteady), the story is very slow to unfold, at first hard to follow and at times exceedingly boring, and honestly.. there isn't a single pleasant-to-look-at person in the whole cast! I hate to say such a thing, but it's sooo true! Don't waste your money and time on this film. If you happen to REALLY want to see it, borrow it from your library."
1,awful,I love to read Jane Austin books and watch movies based upon her novels. I found this adaptation of Persuasion to be extremely tedious. The acting and the directing was extremely poor.
1,I beg to differ,"Having enjoyed all of the other Jane Austen films on DVD I was surprised to find that this turns out to be a true dud. The director displays so little creative fire that he must have been selected by a BBC committee. The lead actors are supposed to convey the romantic tension of the book, yet they couldn't have been less inspiring in their roles. The odd thing is that Siskel & Ebert gave it two thumbs up, and they are usually reliable film critics. While the book is brilliant, I do not recommend this film production of Persuasion."
2,Dissuasion,"This is the only Jane Austen adaptation that I have seen which fails. The characters never engage one's interest, and the influence of Anne's friend is underplayed so much as to leave the viewer wondering why Austen titled her book ""Persuasion"". Primarily missing is the tension between characters and subtle interplay that make Austen's novels such page-turners. Austen is a master at showing the social complexity and background of the early 1800s which this movie mainly misses."
3,"Good, but I was hoping for more recent production",Great story. The main characters didn't have much chemistry. Poor casting. Or maybe editing of scenes or takes where you would get some hint they even know eachother.
4,Persuasion is quiet anticipation,This Jane Austin movie is a quiet film that builds with anticipation as the characters build to a moment when they can finally declare their love against the wishes of others.
5,Good movie from a Great book!,"It is not the greatest in terms of filming, but the acting is good and for what they could do, they did well. Of course, the book is excellent. Another rainy day movie fix!"
3,Need to watch again....,"I am not very impressed with this movie. I expected it to take my breath away and that just simply did not happen. I much, much prefer Pride and Prejudice and also Sense and Sensibility over Persuasion. Maybe I need to watch it again. Sometimes after another viewing it becomes better."
5,Jane Austen's Persuasion - Another BBC Gem,"The actors, scenery, screenplay, performance, etc. all combine to create a wonderful adaptaton of Jane Austen's Persuasion."
5,Be Patient,"This is a fantastic movie! However, if you are not accustomed to the accent the plot may be difficult to understand upon your first viewing. However, once you get used to it, it is a beautiful production of a great book. A book is almost always better than a movie (with the notable exceptions of BBC's Pride and Prejudice, and the Joy Luck Club) but this movie comes very close. It is true to the original, so if you are a high school or college student who has to read this for a class -- the movie will get you a B paper. I very strongly suggest that you read the book as well, even if you aren't a student. If you don't love the ending, please check your pulse."
5,Excellent version.,"Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds are very believable, as are the supporting players, especially Colin Redgrave as the stuffy, self-important father."
5,I am intoxicated by this movie.,"I am no great Austen fan, but my breath catches when I see Wentworth and Anne together. I generally despise Old English or Irish period pieces (I must have had a past life there that was painful), but I am truly transfixed by this video. I am not a fan of Hugh Grant, but the romantic element of Sense and Sensibility so appealed to me that I sought out other Austen videos - and I am touched to the core by the romance of Anne and Captain Wentworth. Sigh. Yes, I admit that I too wondered about the casting of Root (""will she ever SAY anything?!"") but she is wonderful. And another sigh for Hinds.....he is as desperately in love as any woman could hope."
1,How disappointing!,"Having very much enjoyed recent (and not so recent --- 1940's P&P;) film versions of my favorite Austen books (P&P;, S&S;, and Emma) I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, since Persuasion is probably my ""favoritest"" Austen of all. How disappointing! I have no quarrel with the casting or the costumes or the sets or the scenery; BUT it seems to me that anyone who hasn't read the book will have little or no idea where the title comes from. Lady Russell's persuasions eight years before the novel opens are only alluded to in passing, and those during the course of the movie itself seem more like intimidations.Rather they should have titled this particular film ""Family From Hell, after an idea of Jane Austen's"""
1,Pirated copy?,I bought a copy of this excellent movie from Amazon and was very disappointed with the quality. The top third of the screen was distorted in a manner that suggested a very dodgy pirated version. I feel ripped off its going to cost me more to retun it than its worth.Don't buy this product from Amazon.
3,not her best,"I love jane austen, but persuasion was not her best book and it didn't translate into the best movie. it is an all too common plot with actors you couldnt really believe. the leading man wasnt dashing and the leading woman offered no charm which was confusing when she was so highly prized.better as a rental.x"
1,disapointed,"Didn't like the version of Persuasion.It was boring. You could not feel what Anne and Frederick are going through after seeing each other after 8 years,no emotion or feeling and expression.The 2007 version is better.Its not exactly like the book,but a lot better and the Actors play the role fantastic."
1,if you have problems sleeping this is the movie for you!,"Ok, ME and my friend love to watch period pieces and for the past two weeks have been looking for new movies to buy. We saw this and thaught hey it is rated five stars, the same rateing as Pride and prejudice it must be great! well we were so wrong, we both allmoast fell asleep and , my poor friend spent 20 dollers on it! it is so dull, their is hardley any plot. just do not waste your money on it! but hey if you want to go on ebay my friend is selling hers!"
2,omg...................,"i love jane austen and i really enjoy period pieces. but the main character was the WORST actress i have ever seen in my life. she was boring, weird, ugly, and never changed her expression. i dont kno how anyone could love her. i could barely understand what they were saying. a terrible film. i hated it."
2,irritatingly sucky,"Poorly directed and thoroughly uninteresting. I am at a loss to explain why so many people have rated this film so highly: I personally got nothing out of it.The plot is convoluted and has many red herrings; the pace slogs in the middle; the main character is frigid and unreadable, and the climactic moment of passion is confusing and predictable."
2,Snoozer!,"Wow, I typically love movies based on Jane Austen books, but this was a *snoozer*! It moved so slowly, yet had *so* many characters, it was hard to figure out who was who till the movie was just about over. I asked my mother older mother to watch it with me, and she could barely sit through it. This on top of the fact that it was hard to believe that the great-looking and vivacious male love interest was ""all time"" in love with the mousie-looking and very uninteresting and quiet female primary character - I was so unimpressed with the movie that I cannot even remember their characters' names.Luckily I rented it from NetFlix before wasting my money on a DVD. If I hadn't, that DVD would've sat in it's box for the rest of my life. I love all versions of P&P;, and Emma, and S&S;, I even enjoyed the little play-on-P&P; mini-series ""Lost in Austen"", but, this movie?... was not good.I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because the acting, costuming and locations were nice."
4,Excellent,"A very good adaptation of the book, great performances by actors who can act, and wonderful sets. I don't need glossy, beautiful people to fill out these characters."
4,Persuasion,"A very good movie presentation of a Jane Austen book. Typical British casting with good character depictions. Lovely scenery. Very good representations of clothing styles and social class distinctions of the era - upper class snobbery and conniving, a put-upon underdog or rather ""undergirl"" has the viewer urging her to stand up for herself. Almost a ""Cinderella"" story line, and does have a great ending. Lovely way to spend an enjoyable indoor wintery afternoon."
4,Nice adaptation,"While a shortened version of the BBC version, it followed the book fairly well and the cast was wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed the video. Wonderful period movies.This one and others of Jane Austen actually had me reading more on the culture of the society for that period of time."
5,For True Romantics!,Jane Austin does it again and this faithful adaptation will be a joy to all of us true romantics!
3,Not as captivating as BBC/A&E's P&P,I had recently seen Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth before I purchased 'Persuasion' with Amanda Root and this may have been the problem. I fell in love with [P&P] the depth of the characters and attention paid to every detail including and especially the beautiful music. I was disappointed after watching 'Persuasion' and can't quite put my finger on why. You aren't left with the feeling of knowing the characters and it almost seems that it is over before it begins. Very slow and confusing in some parts. I admit I had to use the rewind button several times and use the subtitles. It's a good thing I knew the plot of the story before I began watching.
3,"Yes, faithful. Yes, dear in headlights.","It's difficult for a film to be completely faithful to the novel due to time constraints. Having the novel fresh in my mind, this film does a pretty good job of including the key parts, at the same time it is found a little wanting. Certainly not the best Austen adaptation I've seen. Characters are truly depicted. However, surely Anne Elliot could have had some facial expression other than deer-in headlights. If you're a Jane Austen fan and home sick for the afternoon, it's entertaining enough. But I wouldn't watch it multiple times as I would something like BBC Pride and Prejudice."
5,Loved this Movie,"I loved this movie I loved the actors who were in it and the way they portrayed the characters. I have seen a couple adaptations of the book ""Persuasion"" and I think this one for me is the best version. The only thing that made me sad was that it seemed to take so long in the movie for them to get together and then jump to sailing off into the sunset I would have liked to see a little more emphasis paid on after the engagement how people reacted and how her status in the family changed. I have watched it numerous times and always find something new every time I watch it. Great great movie wishing there was a sequel!!!!"
5,Wonderful adaptation,"I have seen both of the mainstream versions of Persuasion and while this version's male lead is less attractive than the other, the actress who plays Anne is marvelous. She perfectly exemplifies the transition that Anne undergoes through the course of the book. This movie is a very faithful adaptation of the novel, which makes it more worth purchasing than the alternative version."
5,Excellent as expected!,This is my favorite Jane Austen adaptation. It is quiet and meaningfully paced to enjoy the atmosphere of Austen's 18th Century England. As a huge anglophile I have seen Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds in several similar tv/movie productions. They are superb in these roles. The story is quite faithful to the book. The characters are true and lively to watch. I recommend to all romance / british drama lovers everywhere.
5,Romantic and Brilliant!,"Despite ""popular"" opinion, this is not by any means a boring movie! Don't believe what the skeptics tell you, that anything not based in our time period or starring major actors is junk! That is SUCH a lie! I think that the acting is very moving, the story is at once believable and beautiful, the cinematography is spectacular, and the ending is absolutely and completely romantic! I adore the leads! For any movie student, romantic, or even Jane Austen lover, this is a must-see! There is always something new to notice and understand with each viewing, so, it is NEVER boring!"
3,Good Attempt,"This version of Persuasion was generally faithful to Jane Austen's book. Good acting on the part of Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. However, some of the camera work was uneven and choppy. Amanda root is some what plain for the role of Anne and often looks tired and worn-out. The music is excellent, and fits perfectly to the mood. I commend the attempt, though with the past excellent BBC productions in mind (Pride and Prejudice) it is not up to par."
4,A very enjoyable and accurate film version of the book,"The actors and actresses are not beautiful or well known (at least not by American standards) but they all give wonderful portrayals of the characters Austen sets forth in her book. The cover of the original VHS box showed a much younger, beautiful couple who never appear in the film. I'm glad that the current DVD box has fixed that problem and shows Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds on the cover. The film story is very faithful to the book. I cringe at the way Anne's father and sister treat her and at how stupidly, selfish her sister Mary is - and I am supposed to feel this way. These actors and actresses do a great job. It is fun to see Anne blossom and become more self-assured (and prettier) as the movie progresses. Ciaran Hinds, if not a to-die-for hottie in the tradition of Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy, is quite dashing in that British Naval officer uniform."
3,nice,Not one of my favorites...but well done...I will be on the look out for more Amanda Root productions....keep them coming...
3,Deer caught in the headlights,"The movie was good but honestly Amanda Roots' expression throughout the movie until near the end was like a deer caught in the headlights, maybe better yet a bowl leakage expression."
5,Jane Eyre with Timothy Dalton,"I think this one of the best movies that I have ever seen! The acting was superb! It is a long movie, but when I finished the first video, I could hardly get the second one in fast enough. I just sat enrapt! I highly recommend."
2,Close to becomming a hohum effect!,"It was ok.But the leading man!I dont think so! Atleast not at first!He just was'nt handsome enough for my taste.I love the aspect of a handsome guy falling in love with a plain Jane. The leading lady was plain and ""awesome"" at the same time.Her personality;her action's and the look that eye's had steadily held on to;had made her thrillingly ""awesome""! But the leading man just could'nt reach her some sort of level.But the yearning and a sense of some saddness within his eyes'; I could'nt; muchless try to deny! His look's could'nt possibly win me over.But by me being a compassionate person; his eye's sure had won me over! Making him very handsome.And indeed; reaching her level!"
2,Simply Dreadful,"I'm wondering if all the people who gave this great reviews really watched this movie . . . it's long and draggy - it should have learned from the A&E Pride and Prejudice - that movie was 5 hours long, but it never lags. Rent Persuasion, don't buy it."
3,I should have read the book!,"I watched this moving about 11:00 at night, and I could barely keep my eyes open. The lead character started off dry and boring. Her personality started to come through towards the end, but it never quite moved me like""Pride and Prejudice""(the mini-series/ Knightly) It seemed like a forced romance. I never really saw the sparks. I think I'll read the book to capture Jane Austens true intent...because this could not have been it!!"
2,Profoundly Dull,"I really wanted to like this movie since I LOVE Jane Austen movies and books so much. Other people tell me those are boring, but if you understand the language and enjoy subtle wit and romance, they are very enjoyable. This movie however, was a complete disappointment. It was profoundly dull and boring in the extreme. There was next to no musical sountrack and the actors were exceptionally unattractive. Not just the main character who is said to have ""lost her bloom"". I was quite taken aback by the utter scariness of all of the actors in this film. I was all ready for an enjoyable Jane Austen ride into the past, but was supremely disappointed. The movie never picked up and hardly made sense at all. There was no interesting dialogue and you never really got into the characters or the story enough to feel for them. Very flat. Don't waste your time."
1,Terrible adaptation,"I read this book recently and found this movie to be a terrible adaptation of the book. As other reviewers said, Anne was too old and tired looking to represent the Anne of the book. While she had ""lost her bloom"" she seemed to get it back during the course of the story. She also displayed a subtle strength which I did not see in the character at all. Obviously the movie cannot go into the same depth as the book but I found at times they movie veered from the book too much changing the characters in ways that did not do the story justice. In the opera scene, Anne chases down Fredrich desparately..this did NOT happen in the book -she held her composure at all times. I am pretty forgiving of books to movies but this one was just plain poor. I terrible disappointment."
1,persuade me not to watch this,I thought this movie sounded really interesting. It was so slow moving and boring that I fell asleep on it several times and really couldn't tell you how it ended. I enjoy the English versions but this and the actors in it were one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
2,Persuasion,"It was an ok film. The story was decently acted, but I feel that the cast wasn't quite what it could have been. You could just tell that it wasn't up to par with the style and casting of other films about that time."
3,nothing special,"Just a regular clay mask. Dries fast. No miracles. i expected firming effect, but cannot see it. Actually,Nothing specialWon't recommend it"
2,GRANT 741 CHAIN WHEEL,"I ORDER A GRANT 741 CHAIN WHEEL, AND I RECEIVED IT ON TIME, BUT IT WAS THE WRONG SIZE, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 12'' WIDE THE I RECEIVED WAS 9 1/2'' WIDE. I'M VERY VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS. ASKING 4 MY MONEY BACK AND TRYING TO GET IT WOULD BE LIKE PULLING TEETH WITH MY HAND. MAYBE I CAN SALE IT TO A KID, TO PUT ON HIS BIKE OR SOMETHING, IF NOT MAYBE A PAWN SHOP.Grant 741 Chain Wheel"
3,"Looks good, not so great on hands","Looks good, a little small and a few of the welds were sharp and cut my hand a few times...had to file them down."
2,No difference,The product is supposed to create shine while creating the temporary effect of mending split ends. My hair is the same as when I first started using the Kerastase line. It doesn't give a great shine even when i iron my hair.
5,Beautiful switch plate,I love being able to introduce great works of art into a rooms decor with these switch plates. Art plate has a great selection of plate covers with a wonderful color palete. You will find 343 selections to choose from on amazon.I would highly recommend this product. Not only is it beautiful but is made very well.
3,Married/Unmarried,"Good movie, this disc has a bad spot in it. The seller sent me a new one and it also has a bad spot."
2,"Disc defective, film also disappointing","Another example of joyless perversity tut-tutted about in film...Gina Bellman good here, but she's usually good. Pity about most of the rest of it."
2,The noise is a serious defect.,"I have to agree with the other comments here. What good is a VCR if the sound it makes whenever a tape is in motion (playing, rewinding, or forwarding) interferes with the sound coming from your TV? Plug in this VCR, and you'll suddenly feel like you're living under humming phone wires."
2,Disappointed!,"When my 10 year old Panasonic VCR finally died, I went looking for another one. Having been extremely pleased with the quality of my old Panasonic VCR, I decided to puchase the same brand. Boy was I disappointed! The setup instructions were confusing, the buttons on the remote control are too small, and the unit is tooooo noisy!!!!! Needless to say, I returned the unit. I guess the old saying still stands, ""You get what you pay for""."
2,Disappointing deal!,"I purchased one unit last May and it had worked only a little more than 3 monthes. After that, it hasn't worked any more and the warranty for labour expired!"
5,Panasconic VCR,I was very pleased with my experience dealing with this vendor. All thesteps along the way were handling in an excellent manner. The VCR works great.
2,Poor quality,I bought this product last May. It worked for a little more than 3 monthes. The warranty for labour expired after it stopped working!
3,Entertaining film....but very glamorized,"Although an highly entertaining film it is not all entirely accurate. Darby was a seriously torchered soul and I know that's cliche but the man simply could not come to terms with his sexuality and often acted out in his performance what he could not express in real life. His story is sad and I think if someone actually sat him down and said who you are is important and its means something to me, rather not your persona he might of had a chance to continue on. It's tragic really, because his persona became bigger than himself and we see it today with public figures everyday."
1,Absolute Twaddle,"If you love The Germs, do yourself a favor and forgo this terrible piece of crap. If I could have given it less than one star, I would have."
3,"A great drill book with word initial, medial, and final IPA sounds","From a phonetic and speech pathology point of view, this tiny booklet is great and can be used as a beginning supplemental text for word drills employing the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), but it does not include phrases or sentences, which are crucial in developing intelligible American English. Moreover, for those beginning students of American English who are visual-kinesthetic-tactile learners, this book offers no pictures, word definitions, or articulation techniques. For those who want to practice intermediate and advanced conversational skills, choose another book. In addition, this text does not include the important suprasegmentals of speech such as intonation, rhythm and stress. Most importantly, this concise guide is a wire bound paperback which only measures 8.5 x 5.5 x 0.19 inches and is nestled within a plastic cassette holder holding the one cassette."
3,Format can be better,"The main problem is with the use of the cassettes -- with modern technology, can't it be released on CDs, which are much more convenient?"
1,Perfecting the sounds of American English,"I disagree with your sale, because this book was taken from any library. I don't understand how you are selling books from any library.The book named ""Perfecting the sounds of American English"" that you sold me belongs to Macomb County Library, Clinton Township, MI and its code is 421.5209S.I was trying to return this one, I couldn't do it.Norma Yepez"
3,Sega Master System Pro Wrestling,"The movies are cool and u get to continue if u loose BUT why fight the SAME team for 20 rounds, yep 20 freagin rounds b4 they fly away to fight the next team. That get's very repetitive and boring to fight the same team for 20 rounds. It killed the fun for me."
3,Christmas present,This product has nice sound but is not quite the quality I expected. You get what you pay for.
2,poor quality of reproduction,"I purchased this book after seeing several of the paintings in an exhibit at MOMA. The story is important, yet the poor quality of the reproductions greatly diminished the impact of this book."
3,mangled production quality,"In response to the previous review: The quality of the Persea edition is so poor that I suspect it's a production failure. Too much is mangled to be poor proofreading.As to the question of Connelly's undeserved fame. One possible answer is that George Orwell endlessly shilled for Connelly (they were schoolmates). The excellent 4-volume ""collected letters and journalism"" shows Orwell talking up Connelly starting in 1936 and not ending until soon before Orwell's death."
1,Too big.,Specs of what was delivered did not match specs in the product description. I needed something small for cocktail making.
3,I'm not that dumb,"I like the information from this author's books but I felt the book was being ""dumbed down"" by using the characters from ""The Simpsons"" to make his examples. This family does not watch the show. Quantum mechanics does not need to be dumbed down for it's readers."
2,part rehash part ramble,"Greene writes well, but like a number of science authors he covers much of the same ground here as his last book. When he isn't talking about superstring theory, he is presenting a general ramble of diverse topics---kind of like a physics 101 class-- that have been covered many times in the popular literature."
3,could you dumb it down a shade?,"For some reason this book contains dialog between fictional television characters. Complex concepts are explained as if they were an episode of the Simpson's. I don't think most people who read this type of book care to have physics related to television. Green repeats himself and treats the reader as if they are mentally handicapped. I enjoyed the book because I love the topic; however, I found it necessary to skip a few sections."
4,Brian Greene's The Fabric of the Cosmos,"I've read all of Brian Green's books. One thing I found, however, & I'm sure this is just me, is that I needed to read them twice to really understand his books. It was well worth it. His explanations are wonderful when he is talking about the evolution of the universe.Also, he doesn't talk down to the lay-reader who doesn't have a physics degree."
5,Great read,"This book explains the space-time fabric and everything related to it. The first 70-80 pages explain the history of physics, so if you're already familiar with it, you can skip along. Brian Greene uses many methods to explain very complicated topics, and at some points even admits that certain words (such as high/low entropy) still confuse him, which makes him seem more like a down-to-earth person. At some points certain explanations can get a little verbose, but it's better that he says too much than too little. This book allows anyone at a high-school to college reading level to delve into some of the most cutting edge topics in physics and quantum mechanics, without understanding all of the complicated mathematical formulas. He does however include most of the formulas in a notes section with an explanation of the formula, for the mathematically inclined."
5,Best cosmology and popular physics boot I've ever read!,"I've read many books on cosmology and popular physics, from writers such as Kaku, Hawking and others. None as good as this. Green has a real gift on writing easy to understand, clear, descriptive and imaginative books. Most highly recommended."
3,Good Ideas -- Execution is Wanting,"This book is OK. The concepts he tries to bring about are very complex, but very interesting, and definitely challenge our perception of reality. I just think that he lays the analogies on way too thick, such that they break down, and distract more than they are worth. Quantum entanglement is simply bizarre, and notions of multiple universes are mind-boggling. I definitely like hearing about how some of these possibilities may be discovered experimentally soon, which leaves some scientific hope, and makes me want to switch studies and pursue physics---unlike the author's mother (at least in this universe)."
2,Analogies for dummies,"Sorry i took this expression from another reviewer, but it's just the right description. The book is waaay too long. What a brick. I saw his documentary on the Elegant Cosmos, or something like that, and it was fun, so I decided to read the book. What a failure.It's just a jungle of words and similes that only make it more complicated to figure out what he's talking about instead of stating the real thing, which would have been more helpful. I read most of it, as much as I could. But I quit because I came to a point that I felt: So what about all this? What difference does it make? I can't see the implications. There's no synthezising, no summary. I don't know what to make of it. Why should I care about the fabric of the cosmos anyway? What about the implications?The author just seems to be pouring out his mind, conversing to himself while writing. No plan, no organization.Imagine space/time as a loaf of bread, says he. Come on!"
4,Very good but helpless in front the new unusual discoveries,"I liked the Elegant Universe and I enjoyed The Fabric of the Cosmos even more. Anyway this thought provoking book cannot answer the big puzzles that heap in my e-mail delivered from space exploration e-zines. It is hard to digest the mysterious intense stars formation in the early universe, the unanticipated location of the quasars in humble homes and the discovery of huge (about 80 times heavier than the sun) stars that orbit each other in just 3.7 days. These brain twisters can find surprisingly elegant clarification in the ""firework universe"", described by Eugene Savov in his book Theory of Interaction the Simplest Explanation of Everything. This book will make your day if you take some mental effort to understand how the texture of reality is laid bare in it."
4,Quanta in the sky with Diamonds,"Do you wonder why Higgs keeps misplacing his boson? Whether 3-D movies would look even neater in the 10 dimensions that some physicists claim exist? Are you curious as to why strings have theories? When someone says ""branes"", do you think of zombies?Perhaps Star Trek is more your speed. Can we time-travel to the Future? To the Past? Maybe build a Transporter? How `bout all those Parallel Universes we saw in that ST episode where a hundred different Enterprises were floating around due to a rift in the space-time continuum?All these questions are answered in Brian Greene's The Fabric of the Cosmos. It is a well-structured book, aimed at presenting Quantum Physics to the non-physicist, and masterfully accomplished without a single, boring equation. Unfortunately, it can only be recommended to people whose geek factor matches Sheldon's on the TV Show, The Big Bang Theory. Happily, I'm one of those.4 Stars."
5,FABRIC OF THE COSMOS,"This is a deep treatise on the topics of space, time and the structure of the universe. In light of some recent discoveries or should I say theories, it is a good primer to get up to speed on the theories and advancements of physics to the modern era. It's either a great book to put you to sleep, or one that allows you to visit and re-visit thoughts and ideas in a thought provoking format. Not for the faint of heart or casual observer. I was reading it on loan from a friend and was glad to find it on Amazon. The sevice in getting my own copy was nothing less than superb!"
5,The Fabric of the Cosmos,Very good description of a scientific subject. Brian Green is a magnificent writer down to earth with the reader who is not familiar with science.
1,Nothing New,"This book is a major bore. There is nothing new in it, just rehashed stuff. Frankly I was surprised, because this guy is supposedly a great scientist.I was really looking forward to something interesting if not totally new. But all he did was to give a boring report on what physics has accomplished over the years, stuff that we already know.I was looking for maybe some new concept such as his idea of why entanglement happens. There was nothing. Nada.All he could say about entanglement for instance was, well, that it shows us that cosmic space is more than what we might think it to be. Duh!I have an advice for the author. Next time, write a book if or when you get a real cool idea about something. I mean, I--a plain layman--could write this book. Everything in it could be found on wikipedia."
1,"Boring, New-Age Handwaving Coffee Table Book","Here is how Knopf prints money. They get a pseudo-physicist to rewrite his first book on philosophy, after he starred in a TV production centered about it. Long-winded and boring, the wordiness serves to obfuscate the concepts. Stick to Hawking's Brief History of Time or Einstein's Meaning of Relativity. This books adds nothing new, and has begun subtracting. If you're into entertainment and David Duchovney wanna-bes, watch the X-files."
2,ugh quantum physics...,This book its not that it was bad written. I am one of those wholl side with Einstein when it comes to ' is that the way God would do it with Science.' I just didnt feel right going into the Quantum nonsense... If everything was in some sense connected or intervened how could we be individualized? I believe eveything takes a name shape of itself. Quantum physics no matter how hard it strives will nor surpass the entities of God's creation.
4,Very readable and thorough - excellent!,"I enjoyed ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" and think that it gives am excellent non-mathematical overview of much of the new physics. (For a more thorough explanation I recommend Penrose's ""The Road to Reality."")Don't be misled into thinking that the book is `easy' though. The writing is excellent and readable but many of the concepts are counter-intuitive and, like math, one concept builds on another. For me a dozen or so pages at a time was just about enough to digest at a time. One thing I like about Greene's approach is how he sticks to the facts - there's not much `new physics/new age mumbo-jumbo' here. I also like how he ties the history of physics to current thought and explains how so many of the things that we're so sure about might not be so nailed down.Greene has a real gift as a science writer - this is an excellent and well written book that I highly recommend."
4,Angry as Hell,"I guess the reader from Washington DC just proved the recent pronouncment that Amazon reviewers are often masked competitors trying to demean their targets. To call Greene, a distinguished scientist-teacher, a pseudo physicist is ludicrous. This comment in toto is a sophomoric attempt to show off. No wonder it has been found to be decidedly non-helpful. When Greene makes the cutting edge of the almost inconceivable open to laymen who care to understand without having spent their lives in the active pursuit of the sciences he does us all a very great service. I must wonder if the commentator isn't a failed PhD student"
2,A Rehash of The Elagant Universe,"I was disappointed with this book. I enjoy popular physics writing and feel that Greene is one the best science writers around (as well as being a capable physicist in his own right).Greene's earlier work the Elegant Universe was a classic. This book, as others have noted, offers little new thought and appears to be a rehash of the author's previous work.Although not badly written it will probably only be of interest to readers new to this area. On a side note the audio tape is well done."
1,move along...,"I really regret undermining the hard work of others, but it is worth it to spare the frustrations of readers: this book is dead. I expected at least an interesting appraisal of the current view of cosmology, but it was redundant, and grossly over-simplified even for those of us who are not into applicable science or theoretical math. I never thought I would break into skimming, but I did, and it only got worse seeing that even that was not stimulating enough. It feels like a stoner's rant. The book could have been compressed into a small pamphlet, and I still would have felt the same way.1 star- for a pretty cover.On another note...If a person takes the scientific field as a whole then they will chase down countless dead ends. Rather appreciate your time by going to the illuminated minds. If you are hungry for cosmology, look up Walter Russell."
2,very basic and very wordy,"Of popular Physics books, this must be one of the most superficial. For anyone who already has an even vague idea that quantum mechanics pertains to the tiny, or that relativity has to do with combining the 3 dimensions of space with the one of time, this book will be way too basic. Even for other readers, I don't see what the long sequences of near repetitions of statements and examples does to elucidate. It is absolutely insulting in its implied estimate of its reader. I quit reading in disgust after 4 chapters, finally giving up hope that anything would be discussed in depth.I honestly believe all ideas in this book could be clearly expressed in a book one tenth its length.I'd recommend reading books by Timothy Ferris instead."
4,Who is Marge? Who is Scully?,"I liked the book. It covered a fair amount and it was readable and straightforward.HOWEVER, I have only ever watched ONE single episode of The Simpsons, I have only ever watched ONE single episode of the X-Files and I have only ever ONCE suffered through the boredom of a baseball game. Does this guy ever leave the USA? Is he assuming his audience is brain-dead americans?Marred an otherwise good read."
1,"As vacuous as the TV show, but a lot longer","This book begins with endless long-winded explanationsof modern physics based on analogies that don't explain muchbut do involve characters from the Simpsons. The later chapterson string theory are even more breathlessly gee-whiz andcontent-free than the author's TV show, but do go on and on.The author makes no attempt to distinguish between things for which there is scientific evidence and things which he thinks sound cool. He's clearly much more interested in the latter than the former."
3,"Too much theory, too little data","As a former researcher myself, I just couldn't deal with the layer upon layer of speculation - even though it is interesting speculation."
4,Physics for dummies,Brian Greene has done an outstanding job in this book explaining physics to the average person. He leaves out the formulas and equations and uses analogies to explain complex theories. He explains the following:1).Spacetime2).Worm holes3).How and why time flows4).Everthing Quantum5).The big bang6).All about String theory7).M-Theory8).Teleporters and time machinesIf you want a user friendly book on physics this is it. It is not an easy read but the effort is worth it if you are truly interested in the fabric of reality.
4,Greene's enthusiasm is contagious,"Greene did an excellent job with this book; he explained a plethora of deep-level physics concepts in ordinary language, without confusing his readers with high level math (though you can check the notes if that's your thing). I found some parts really intriguing and mind-blowing, others too repetitive and too focused on details. If this is one of your first physics reads, take your time. it isn't exactly your tuck-in-the-covers-right-before-sleep read, but some of the references to popular culture might give you a giggle.This book is readable for all ages, including 17-year-old high school students like myself."
4,A fun read for the Physics and Mathematically challenged,"Greene tells us the story of modern Cosmology and the Physics supporting it in an almost non-technical manner. Using a fun loving style and upbeat tone, Greene employs popular iconic characters from classic Americana to teach. Mulder and Scully, Bart and Lisa, Homer and Marge have never worked together so well. For those, who like me are Physics and Mathematically ignorant, this book will indeed be a fun and educating read. I found chapter four, dealing with the phenomona of Quantum Entanglement and the Non-Local nature of Quantum theory, especially enlightening. Greene's description of Inflationary Expansion in the Big Bang model of the beginning of the Universe was clear even to me. I look forward to reading Greene's other book ""The Elegant Universe"" to learn even more about Super-string and M-Theory. This book is worth reading."
2,Time will slow down,"Physics is a really exciting subject. This book does a fantastic job at destroying the excitement and turning an astounding and endlessly interesting subject into a tedium of slow and endlessly repetitive descriptions.Truly the greatest test for the theory of relativity; marvel at how time will apparently stand still while reading the same description for the umpteenth time.There are a few atoms of brilliantly written, clear and concise explanation hidden amongst a massive swirling cloud of high entropy drivel.Over and over...Did I mention it just keeps repeating itself?You get the idea..."
3,Not done yet...,"...but i have a quesiton and some comments. First, i've really been struggling with the ""Persistent Illusion of Past, Present and Future"" section (pages 132-139). I simply cannot grasp why when ""Chewie"" stands and walks away from Earth, his conception of ""now"" rotates into the past. Can anyone explain it?As for comments, the graphics are downright microscopic and the book does cover lots of the same ground as Elegant. Also, in his description of the ""two-slit"" experiment he completely neglected to say what makes it so weird: the fact that the particle interacts with itself and follows all possible paths in the universe on its way to the photo screen. I hope he gets back to that..."
3,Cashing in on the success of the Elegant Universe?,"The Elegant Universe is unquestionably brilliant. This book is a good reminder if you don't want to re-read the Elegant Universe but there's not all that much new here, perhaps because progress in string theory is slow."
3,good review for The Elegant Universe,"This is a good review aftering reading The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory. If you are new to Greene start with the Elegant Universe and then if you must go on to the The Fabric of the Cosmos"
2,Sleeper,"Some interesting and enlightening parts were eventually deadened by monotonous and uninpiring overly-scientific exposition in my audio-version. Yawn. Too heady and scientific for me. Give me Newtonian physics any day! Reality was much simpler then. Of course, alot of the time I am not sure this author, or anyone else for that matter, knows what they are talking about in attempting to describe, mathematically or otherwise, string or superstring theory. YUK!"
5,not just Elegant Universe for Dummies!,I don't know what to add that hasn't already been said!I own both his books and this isn't a rehash.I break this one out every few months to reread because it's that good!Buy it now!!
4,The NOVA special was better,"I bought thhs because of his 4-part special on Nova in late 2011. The physics is heavy going sometimes but he writes so well that this is somewhat alleviated. Still about 80-90% was over my head; wouldn't buy it if I had a do-over. I've ranted many a time about ""endnotes"" - 42 pages of them, but in this case justified. As he explains, they go into even heavier matters."
3,"Good for advanced, not beginners","This dictionary is thorough. A well-educated native-Persian-speaker tutoring me was amused to find the dictionary has words he doesn't even know. The book will be more useful for me when I'm further along in my study of Persian.My two main frustrations: 1) Pronunciation help is the exception. Most words show the Persian without any vowel markings, followed by (sometimes cryptic) English explanations/equivalents. Not useful in learning to speak, but fine for reading. 2) The print is so small that some of the letters blur and are difficult to distinguish. A couple have actually been rubbed in the production process so I can't figure them out without the help of a native speaker.Probably a good buy for a Persian speaker learning English. Less so for vice versa unless the English speaker is advanced."
3,"Old, not for beginners","Suleiman Haim published numerous Persian-English dictionaries from the 1930's to the 1950's. They were designed primarily for native speakers of Persian. This dictionary features a very small number of vowel signs in the Persian headwords, mainly to disambiguate words with the same consonants but different vowels. Its age, of course, limits the modernity of its vocabulary, and it definitely leans toward old-fashioned English renderings. This dictionary should be reasonably serviceable for an advanced student of Persian reading literature from the first half of the 20th century. For more recent literature, you should consider more recent dictionaries, such asThe Combined New Persian-English and English-Persian Dictionary. Steingass (A Comprehensive Persian English Dictionary Including the Arabic Words and Phrases To Be Met Within Persian Literature) is undoubtedly the most comprehensive for classical Persian literature."
4,Tape works!,Used tape to cover up a hole in the exhaust vent. Worked great and matched the color of the vent well. Holds up well to the elements.
3,"I love the older style, zippers on the sides, this newer style, not so much","The zipper in the middle replaced the zippers on the side. I can see how this is nice for warmth only, but it's difficult for baby to turn his/her head to look outside. If you can find the older style (last year), you'll be much happier. With zippers on the sides, you zip up as far as you want. You can put a hat on your baby so his/her ears stay warm. But the big bonus for us is that we zip off the entire top and use it for a cushion on his swing. Once we discovered that he didn't like sitting on hard surfaces, we began taking off the top and using it on a lot of hard seats."
2,Didn't care for,"I purchased this as a shower gift for a friend and was not at all impressed. I found the bundle me to be a much better value, it is not just a cover, it fits into the carrier/stroller, so you have fleece underneath and it zips up the sides so there is nothing around the face unless you need it to be. If you are looking for a something like this try the bundle me, I loved it for all 3 of my boys, still do!"
3,Probability theory from the scratch,It starts with very basic concepts of probability theory and covers a lot of topics in a very brief and up to the poit way. It does not go through much details. Beginners need to spend a lot of time on each page to understand what is going on.
1,Actually sucks knowledge from your brain,"I think perhaps that.... (The rest of this sentence is left to the reader). I know you were wondering why I used four dots instead of three but please trust me I will explain later. 'Think' is obviously used here instead of 'know'. One's intuition might suggest that know is a better word here but this is not the case! If you are feeling energetic then you could rearrange the letters in this review to produce a short collection of poetry.If you can read this review then by all means read this book. If you want to learn the theory of probability then don't. This book will confuse and baffle and ruin any knowledge you have. Maths is NOT hard, and it is not clever to make it seem hard. When people are writing books such as Kolmogorov's Intro. to Analysis and Oksendal's SDEs then no-one should be writing books like this."
1,A Total Waste of Time,"As I have mentioned above, do not under any circumstances read (or even worse buy) this book. The layout is abolutely terrible and does the book no favours whatsoever. As indicated by previous reviews most of the proofs are completely glossed over with little or no mathematical rigour in sight. The appendices for the selected chapters are pretty much void of any use, and I can't see why the contents of these appendices could not have been included in the chapters in the first place (not that it would of made much of a difference). Hardly anything is explained with much clarity here and I don't know about anyone else out there but I would consider a one line example not much help at all. Everything right down to the way the index is presented is substandard in this book and the authors ""attempts"" at humour constituted the proverbial last straw for me (I find the assumption that all mathematics students like Star Trek somewhat insulting). In short this book is ABSOLUTE RUBBISH."
5,Efficient learning method even for non-native english speakers,I am a german native speaker and i really appreciate learning vietnamese by the pimsleur method. The english speaker is easy to understand and the vietnamese phrases are repeated often enough. I learned english in school and a bit spanish and french but i never learned a language as fast as by the pimsleur method. I usually hear the CDs during I drive my car which enables me to use my time as efficiently as possible. I am currently in the midway of comprehensive level I and I am really satisfied to say my first vietnamese sentences which are understood by my vietnames friends. I have just to excerise more my pronunciation. ;-)
2,"Ok, but some mistakes... barely responsive customer service","I have purchased this item and the shorter version. During my studies I was told by several Vietnamese that some words and forms of address taught by Pimsleur were incorrect (and could be insulting). For instance, the word 'chi' should never be used to address a younger woman; you are calling her an old man. Although this thread runs through the course, most of it is OK... if you don't mind making the correct substitutions yourself. When customer service was contacted they said they would have a linguist 'get back to me'. Never happened."
2,Factual Errors,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. It contained some glaring factual errors. For instance, in the chapter called ""Funding Terror"" the author states that Muhammad al-Durrah, the father of a suicide bomber, was given money by the Saudis. A simple search online will show that Muhammad al-Durrah was a 12-year-old child who was unarmed when shot dead by Israeli Defense Force troops. He was unarmed and certainly NOT a suicide bomber!! His father's name was Jamal. So the author certainly needs to get his facts straight. Take anything in this book with a grain of salt!"
5,Dads have their scribe!,"You're going to start laughing as soon as you pick up ""Mack Daddy."" But you may be half-way through before you realize just how insightful and wise the author really is. Sure, it's funny. But it also contains some of the most important advice a man could ever receive: not about how to climb the corporate ladder or improve a golf score, but how to be a better father. What's more important than that? Anybody who knows an underappreciated dad should make his day by having him read this."
1,Wow - nice information...but lots of foul language!,"I bought this book for my brother, a first time dad. When it arrived, I thought I'd just skim thru it, but ended up reading quite a bit. I'm not a prude, but the amount of filthy talk in this book blew my mind. I felt it was totally unnecessary & hope the author doesn't speak like that in front of his children. I was too embarrassed to give it to my brother because I don't think he'd want such trash talk anywhere in his house. I couldn't believe that none of the reviews of this book mentioned the dirty words! Four letter ones & otherwise. The ""F"" bomb is dropped repeatedly.The information was funny and the author gave some great insight - I just wish there was a ""cleaner"" version for those who do not speak foul language."
5,Good Read For New Dads,"I enjoyed it. Fairly conservative and a hair self righteous. But that wasn't really a big deal. It's a good book with good information, definitely a good read for a new father."
5,A must have for caligraphers,"If you want to have a collection of some of the best calligraphic works in one book, this is the book for you!"
4,Tells about the exciting life of the great Baker,"""Jazz"" is very compelling, very vivid! It leaves nothing out and informs the reader of cetain aspects of Baker's life that maybe one did not know about. She contributed a lot to the Civil Rights movement and was considered to be ahead of her time.I,personally, recommend ""Jazz Cleopatra"" to all who was, is, and wants to be a fan of Josephine Baker!!"
3,Josephine,I always enjoy reading stories or literature about Josephine Baker. I have read many books and autobiographies about her and I learn from each one of them. This book only skims the personal life of Josephine and it over analyzes her successes and failures. The best book I read about Josephine was written by one of her adopted sons. She was a remarkable woman.
4,Practically Perfect Patchwork,"I borrowed this book from the library, and quickly decided I needed to find one to purchase. The tips that are included are invaluable, and she lets you know that it is normal for squares not to be perfect, and gives you tips on how to make them perfect. Very good reference for those of us just starting out."
3,"Mediocre poetry, Redundant illustrations","The best thing about this book was that it introduced me to Edward Lear. Everything else was so-so which here means lacked creativity and bored me. My favorite parts were the prose introduction, the explanations of the material for the poetry, and the timeline."
3,Error in tracks,"track 5 is not ""Una Extraña Sensación de Soledad"" it's ""Educación Anterior"" and it is not completed. it only has 0.47 seconds. Please correct error an deliver correction FREE. I aleady paid for this song."
1,useless,"it lasted about a week, hard to charge up when it was new. Basically, it lasted 2 charges, then it was done. Won't recharge anymore."
2,Customer Service Sucks,The unit is a GREAT kitchen tool. BUT customer service is blunt and poor --- although I live 200+ miles from a 'service center' they curtly demanded I call the center and deliver it to them. The unit stopped heating beyond 135F after a few uses and needs either a thermostat or better a new heating element. REDICULOUS. I will not purchase any DeLonghi product again after experiencing their customer service office.
3,Arrived Broken But Returned Without Hassle,"I ordered this as it seems to be the only fryer on the market that ISNT made in China! This baby is made in Italy, the quality seems good except I couldnt try it out as it arrived damaged in shipping (note Amazon to their credit is accepting the return without any hassles/problem). DeLonghi needs to re-think they way they put the thermostat housing into their box. Mine had 2 of the 4 tabs that hold it to the body broken off as during shipping it is hanging in the same position as it would be in use thus stressing the tabs. I'll most likely order another once Amazon gets them back in stock & provide a follow-up review."
4,Good comedy enhanced by music,"This movie is an excellent comedy about friendship and sex. Memorable moments to the sound of U2's cover of Patty Smith's ""Dancing Barefoot"" and General Public's ""I'll take you there"". Definetely worth watching it. Buy it on DVD if you really love it. Even if you don't like this movie you have to get the soundtrack CD.If you like fun triangles like this, try : Reality Bites"
3,Funny,"I hadn't seen this movie in a long time and it was nice to see it again.This movie will never be called one of the greatest of all time, at least not in my book, but still and oldie about 3 young college students thrown into a strange situation.Lara Flynn Boyle's charater comes off slightly annoying but I assume that's the whole point.Lots's of talk about sex, hence the name of the film, but never anything too extreme.Overall a funny movie and a good one to watch when you aren't looking for anything too serious and you just want to sit back and have a good laugh."
4,A Must-See,"Threesome is a must-see for college students or college-bound students. It's a hilarious portrayal of 3 students who turn a Housing Office mistake into a high point in their lives. There are plenty of laughs, and some thought-provoking narration. I own it myself."
3,Unnecessarily explicit,"Maybe enjoyable and well-made if viewed as a softcore flick, but basically I found it a trashy movie where young actors got naked in order to attract teenager audience. I felt sorry for Alexis Arquette."
2,Muddled,"An implausible pretext (girl-with-androgynous-name-mistaken-by- college-housing-computer-for-boy) and uninspired writing are salvaged only by occasionally winning performances from the attractive young cast. As an expression of Gay 90s liberation, though, the film is grossly unfair: the straight characters get to have intercourse, but the poor homosexual must settle for a fleeting caress of a Baldwin gluteus."
5,"Honest, thought-provoking",This is one of my favorite college movies. The script was sensitive and thoughtful. Andrew Fleming brought out some great performances in his three lead characters. By far one of the most under-rated movies around. This theme in particular needs to be explored by mainstream Hollywood more often. I was delighted that it was 2 guys and 1 girl.
1,mis represented,"this is probably a nice sub , but it stated that it would fit in my silverado . well maby if i set it in the seat , no where else ,, had to send it back !"
3,"good box, crap speaker","I bought this for the box and didn't expect much from the speaker but I thought it would last till i could buy something better. After 3 weeks it died (blown coil). I haven't bought the speaker i want yet so i replaced it with one I've had 5 years (fosgate P1 150W rms), it sounds louder deeper and handles much more power than the 500W pile. This speaker does NOT have a built in low pass filter, the reason for its low output is the low quality coil and the extreemly thick, stiff face(cone and rubber surround). The box is worth the sale price, consider the speaker a freeby and replace it soon.Also blowing a speaker can damage your amp so be carefull (I was lucky)."
1,do not buy,this product arrived broken do not buy it is not worth your time and money it is not worth either
3,Great Box Terrible Speaker,great bandpass box terrible speaker. Speaker failed in two days replaced with a Kicker Comp. Man what a better sound.
4,Good cheap sub for small cars and trucks.,i bought all 3 things i needed. The subwoofer is of decent quality. I major in electronics and know a little about subs. The subwoofer itself is good. The box needs some work. 1st of when you buy it take the damn plexi-glass off it blocks to much of the sound and auctually hits harder and louder without the glass. 2nd tighten all the screws on the subwoofer and think about getting longer one and add locktite even with the glass if you keep it. the sub max's out at 800 watts it says 500 but performs great at 800.
2,junk!!,seriously its JUNK.i plugged it in to my 480 watt amp 2 channel so it got 240 watts and the boxes back part flew off O.O.the sub is not good for low bass so this system is just for the looks.dont even waste your $45.get a nicer brand and spend a lil more but have some decent bass in your car.this is nothing
5,wonderful companion to Bradley class,"This book was everything that the 'what to expect when you are expecting' book was not, in other words - it's well written, comprehensive, and treats you like you have a brain. It's wonderfully informative and, while it is natural birth oriented, it still covers all the medicated and interventionist methods also. It was a nice additional read during our Bradley classes."
5,Helpful Resource,The Birth Partner was a great book for anyone that wants to learn more about being a partner in the birthing/delivery process. I was a complete novice and found it so helpful to prepare me for my role in being a birthing coach for my friends home birth.
4,Loved this book,I loved this book I read it cover to cover in less than 3 days I found it very informative and the highlighted pages would be very usefull in the labor and delivery room. I look forward to being able to use it during the actual delivery
3,Not all that,"This book was a waste of time for me and my partner. The same information was found in various other books I have on birth and parenting. Plus the book was a little dry cut. However, the information was well stated."
5,A must have for homebirths!,"This was the book we pulled out most often when planning our homebirth! I bought it for my husband, but I kept stealing it from him. Very valuable information. Highly recommended for homebirthing dads and doulas!"
5,"For pregnant women, fathers-to-be, family members & friends","Now in an updated and expanded second edition, Penny Simkin's The Birth Partner: Everything You Need To Know To Help A Woman Through Childbirth continues to be one of the most ""user friendly"" guides available for pregnant women, fathers-to-be, family members, friends and loved ones wanting to be of help to the expectant mother throughout the event of child birth. Here is are explained are the definitive and up-to-date techniques and devices for easing labor pain; epidural anesthesia and other medications; tests and treatments of the fetus and newborn; vaginal birth after cesarean; and more. If you or your loved one is preparing to give birth, you need to sit down and carefully read through Penny Simkin's The Birth Partner!"
4,A good buy!!!,"It is written to tell couples about a mid wife, but it actually helped me to better assist my wife during labor and delivery.It's a good buy to khow some of the things going on."
4,Pretty damn funny,Comes with a bonus DVD which makes this def. worth the money. Very funny commedian.
3,"Works, but is not your best option.","This clutch does what it is supposed to, but not nearly as well as others that are available. Especially if it is going on a mini bike or gokart. It slips like crazy under any small amount of torque. Get the hillard clutch instead.Hilliard Extreme-Duty Centrifugal Clutch - 3/4in. Bore, 12 Tooth, 35 Chain Size"
2,Don't be misled,"First the good. the intensity is as advertised- it's loud. The installation is relatively straightforward as well, and the compact size makes finding a mounting location simple.Now the bad. While the decibel level is high, the frequency of the horn blast sounds like an amplified honker you'd find on a 10 year old's huffy. There are 2 horns built into the unit- one at 530 Hz and one at 680 Hz. If you're looking for a relatively deep, low-sounding air horn this is not the one you want. I didn't expect a thunderous rumble from a compact unit like this, but the high tone was disappointing. After installation and hearing the sound produced, I wired the factory horn in as well just to offset the high, tinny tone of the air horn.So to summarize, if you're looking for a relatively loud horn with that distinct air horn warble, then the price and ease of installation make this worth while. If you're looking for the ""Big Rig BLAST,"" you're never going to get it out of a compact unit like this."
2,"Love Buffy, but...","I LOVE Buffy The Vampire Slayer, and Angel, ...but the Unseen Trilogy books were SO boring to me. I could hardly get through them. Better to not waste the time and money on this. Buy the Long Way Home graphic novel series instead."
3,Super Reader,"Take some shadowy unseen monsters, add in a young gang of vampire worshippers, two poltergeists in a family, some of the Russian mafia, some gangs into magic, a few bent cops, and nobody is quite sure where this is going. It all starts when a rich girl tells Buffy her dilettante brother is missing, and Cordelia runs into some stray girls who want to be vampires.At the end of the book, many monsters start appearing, and no-one knows why. A bit all over the place, this one."
2,Rather disappointing,"I guess I expected better from a Nancy Holder story. The chapters kept repeating the same information over and over with slow to little progression of the main story line. The characters I've grown to love, Buffy, Willow, and Angel, along with the ones I can do without, Riley and Tara, never really connect on an emotional level with each other or to me as the reader. I do like the interaction between Willow and fellow witch, Dona Pilar. I also enjoyed the Cordelia/Wesley story with the girls enamored of vampires and of wanting to become one themselves. I am ready to read book 2 and have high hopes that it will be more to my liking."
3,Interesting Idea,"When I first read this, I thought that perhaps this would be a story based upon the episode ""Invisible Girl"". Much to my delight, I was wrong. This is a good story that could be taken seriously if set away from the Buffyverse. I'm glad they've finally brought Tara and Anya into the books, I could do without Riley, though. I am anxiously awaiting the next book in this trilogy, and hope it doesn't turn out like ""Gatemasters"" did."
4,A Great Start,"Unseen, The Burning is the first book in a promising new Buffy the Vampire Slayer/Angel crossover trilogy. Nancy Holder and Jeff Mariotte have created interesting plots for both Buffy and Angel to pursue. Buffy is trying to help Willow's friend while Angel is responding to a summons by the powers that be. When all story lines lead to LA and the same informant, Angel and Buffy collide literally. The novel is set at the end of Buffy's fourth television season and the first season of Angel. The authors are careful to keep the relationships and conflicts intact. They include enough background so anyone could enjoy the book but not too much to bore a TV fan. The cliffhanger ending is frustrating but ripe with promise. Riley, Angel and Buffy forced to work together. Missing girls, gangs, shadow monsters and witchcraft all combine to convince the reader to preorder the next volume. I recommend the series highly"
1,Don't judge a book by its cover,"If you are buying this book because you believe it is a Buffy the Vampire Slayer/Angel crossover, save your money. The two supposed ""main characters"" move in separate storylines, as though the two authors took turns writing chapters. While the Angel sections are mildly diverting, and at least somewhat true to character, the book is ultimately little more than a paean to the ""deep,"" and according to the show's own eventual revelations, entirely imaginary love of Buffy Summers for Riley Finn.From the time I first read about it, I really looked forward to the issuance of this book. It is now residing in my garbage can, one of only two books I have thrown out in my life."
3,"Slow-Paced, But A Good Read","This is the first book of the Unseen trilogy, and I found it to be a little slow-paced. Still, the book makes for a good weekend read, especially if you're a Buffy fan! All your favorites from the TV shows are here, including Spike and Anya, and they remain true to their TV selves. There are many subplots to juggle, including Buffy and Willow helping a friend in Sunnydale find her lost brother, and Angel working diligently in L.A. to help free a man framed for murder. Actually, the subplot that I enjoyed the most was Cordelia's--she finds a group of teenage runaways who worship vampires and learns that they may have found a vampire who will turn them. Again, I found this book to be a little slow-paced, but it was still fun to read. Worth checking out if you love Buffy!"
1,a remarkable musical event,this is the worst thing i have heard in 58 years.the cd has no redeeming value.i have nailed the cd to my listening room wall.it's quite an achievement to be the worst of anything.
3,Watch out for highlighting,"I needed this book for a class, and it arrived in time and in very good condition as promised by the seller. The seller mentioned that it was slightly highlighted, but neglected to say that the highlighting was blue. The dark blue was distracting for me, and made it more difficult to read the pages.I would definitely use this seller again. They ship on time and offer great prices."
4,sticker fun for Caillou fans,"This book is based on an episode of the popular PBS series, the one in which Caillou's family goes to an amusement park. The story is a little longer than a kiddie book, and is suitable for preschool children or younger ones who've seen the episode. Pages are slick so kids can place the 24 reusable stickers."
4,Eddie Still Rocks,Saw Eddie and the Cruisers I years ago. Just got Part II. Eddie Lives and still rocks. Finally got the denouement of the Eddie Wilson story. Good wrap-up with more good music. Go Cruisers! Thanks Amazon.com!
4,One Movie,"Eddie and the Cruisers is a great film, great music, super performances. Eddie Lives is the opposite. The crazy thing is, the b-story of the movie, newly found recordings of Eddie and some mystery players, should have been in the first movie as it was in the original novel as the recordings Eddie One fans know as 'Season In Hell' If Eddie Two was never made, life would have gone on. The fact that Eddie Two was made just goes to show that people actually had a fondness for the first film and a litle bit of care should have been apply when doing a sequel."
1,missing,"when i received the dvd only Eddie and the Cruisers was in the case, not Eddie and the Cruisers II"
5,Arrived On Time,Arrived on Time and my Dad loved these movies and I bought them on DVD for him and he was happy that I got them for him and I will defently buy from amazon again.
3,5 start for E&TC I and 0 stars for EL,"I loved the first movie and can easily give it 5 stars - It is a ""cult classic"" and one of the best ""Prism"" (Now defunct Philly area cable service) movies of all-time but Eddie Lives (which I hadn't seen prior to buying the DVD) is one of (if not THE) worst movies I have ever had the displeasure of watching - I got 2/3 through EL before finally give up for my own sanity - I can watch bad movies but EL was unwatchable and like I said I LOVE E&TC - Sorry EL fans, the music and acting was bad - Maybe they spent all the budget getting Michael Pare to do the sequel - He looks like DiNiro in EL next to the people off the street they got to act in the movie - EL is so painful that only the solace I gain from writing how bad it was makes me feel any cleaner after watching it - Eddie may live but a part of my soul died from watching that garbage - Thanks for indulging me - BTW it is worth the price of the movie for E&TC, just for god's sake don't flip the disc over!"
1,Be warned!!!,"Be Warned, this is not 2 discs, it is 1 dual sided disc. The description clearly states 2 discs, not 1. I was really dissatisfied with that.Actors: Michael Pare, Tom BerengerFormat: Color, Dolby, DVD, Subtitled, Widescreen, NTSCLanguage: EnglishSubtitles: Spanish, EnglishRegion: Region 1 (U.S. and Canada only. Read more about DVD formats.)Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1Number of discs: 2Rated: PG (Parental Guidance Suggested)Studio: MGM (Video & DVD)DVD Release Date: June 10, 2008"
5,odd but wonderful,"Odd but wonderful movie, especially if you love rock music and its early years, and if you have ever loved a small local band"
5,Eddie and the Cruisers 1983 / Eddie and the Cruisers II,I found this very enjoyable when I first rented Eddie and the Cruiser II. So I decided I just had to have my own copy so I could watch it whenever I wanted a rock n roll fix.It is a great movie for anyone who likes the 60s vibe.
3,This aint what we been waitin for,"Well we already know eddie 1 & 2 are underated by the critics and we love these two movies. That being said , we waited for this american release for a long time and it is disappointing, the audio (others dont agree) but sounds great on my system . The video is sharp & bright on both. however the 2 movies are on a single flipper disc and no insert inside of any kind. (hence the low price) but the most dissappointing thing is played side by side with the canadian release of eddie lives 2, its apparant you dont get to see more of the picture , the widescreen screen version actually shows less on top & bottom and the sides are same, so in my opion this was a cheap release and not what the eddie fans have been waiting for :("
2,Problem with the sound on the second movie!!!!,"I just bought the Eddie and the Cruisers /Eddie and the Cruisers 2 combo dvd and there is a problem with the sound on the second movie. There is no bottom end on it, it sounds like it was all filtered out. This has to be a mistake in authoring. I will bet MGM is gong to fix this. The films look ok, but the look out for the sound on side two!"
5,Just as I remembered...,"We loved the original when it first came out in the 80's. Tom Beringer, Ellen Barkin, Michael Pare and Joe Pantoliano are just a few of the still familiar faces from this little movie. It's campy, clean and John Cafferty wrote a soundtrack that is just as enjoyable to listen to today. We had an ""Eddie and the Cruisers Night"" when we received the discs and watching the 2 movies back to back was fun! Of course, because 3 of the main characters from the original were absent, there were the obvious flaws in the editing of one storyline to the second, but that was fun too. It's good nostalgia if you are into that.If you have a big plasma screen that fills half your wall, it is not HD and my not translate well - but I am not sure. My old 36"" RCA Tube TV still works great (and if I need the big screen experience, I sit closer *wink*)and I have never tried viewing it on a plasma."
4,Part of a package,This was part of a 3-piece set. Daughter-in-law is a fan. She was excited to see so much in one package.
5,Eddie & the cruisers 2,Great music and a better than average story line with fair acting. The music makes it 5 star for me
4,slow and romantic,"This is a good set, but I think this CD is overrated. The tempo is a little slow and the performance is more ""romantic"", so it does not carry Ravel's coolness. Overall, good interpretation for those who like sweet, syrupy taste."
3,Brian Forst exaggerates greatly,"This Ravel 2-CD set is a good one, but don't take Brian Forst's word for it. He says that Alex Ross of The New Yorker turned him on to it, yet Forst's review is dated June 3 and The New Yorker issue with Ross's review is dated June 5. So Forst maybe had just a couple of days to buy the CD and evaluate it. I don't trust any review of a 2-CD set made so quickly.My advice is to closely look at other sources such as the Penguin Guide to Classical Music and The Record Shelf Guide to the Classical Repertoire (Jim Svejda) before making your decision. Both books take careful consideration of recordings and COMPARE them against competing recordings--not like Forst's review.Rosa La Luna"
2,Crank and Crank for Very little light,"I ordered two of these, one for home emergencies and one for a Christmas gift. Once they arrived I opened the one for home use and cranked the handle for 2 minutes as stated on the package (on the website it says 1 minute crank for 20 minutes of light), on the package it states that cranking for that long will give you 8-12 minutes of light from the flashlight. It only stayed lit for 1.5 minutes, which is a far cry from what is advertised. The other unit seemed to work properly but I decided that a 50% success ratio was not good enough for me to give one of them as a gift. So they are being returned. Other than the one defective unit the product itself is ok, light was just ok (from the one that worked). The radio worked fine, I could pick up a couple local stations (decent for emergencies). Not sure what the durability of these units would be, they were made of the cheap plastic that most of these type unit are made from. Purchase at your own risk."
1,Does not fit 2005 Toyota Tacoma!,Pads do not fit vehicle stated in description...waste of time and MY money...I had to buy pads during the install at a brake shop which were considerably more expensive...not happy.
3,Promising concept - mediocre execution,"The jacket summary for this book suggests an interesting concept for exploration, namely the reasons that some scientific theories remain in obscurity for generations, only to be subsequently 'rediscovered' and validated. After reading this book, I'm still waiting for a thorough treatment of this phenomenon. The book is a collection of five essays that are not thematically connected as well as I would expect. Several of the essays largely consists of anecdotes and personal observations, not any sort of philosophical development or historical overview. Oliver Sacks' closing essay, ""Scotoma: Forgetting and Neglect in Science"", is by far the best and could well serve as the basis for a more complete treatment. Too bad I couldn't find this article on the New York Review of Books Web site since it would save buying the book."
4,'Buried Alive',"HIS DOUBLE LIFE is based on the Arnold Bennett play, ""Buried Alive."" It's the story of Priam Farrel, a reclusive artist who assumes the identity of his deceased valet rather than travel from America to Britain to accept a knightship. When he meets his alias's penpal girlfriend, Farrel falls in love and wants to marry her. That's when the dead valet's family arrives unexpectedly....This is one of only two ""talkies"" Lillian Gish appeared in during the 1930s. When ""His Double Life"" was remade in 1943 as ""Holy Matrimony,"" this version was taken out of circulation.Lillian Gish also co-starred in D.W. Griffith's 1915 epicTHE BIRTH OF A NATION.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 viewer poll rating found at a film resource website.(6.4) His Double Life (1933) - Roland Young/Lillian Gish/Montagu Love/Lumsden Hare/Lucy Beaumont"
1,"Might have been worth watching when I used to get high,,, waste of time!","I'm all for low budget movies giving aspiring film makers a chance, but SOME talent must be present to succeed."
5,"Nutso, I a Fun Way","Phil is one of those movies goofy enought to be a crack-up. The odd array of characters and the characterizations keep the show rolling, it's one I gotta see again and probably routinely herefafter. Watch out for the Beaver!"
1,Beware! Two out of three of my Hoover machines broke in the first hours of use,"I own three Hoover cleaning machines. I wish I owned none.I own a SteamVac Carpet Cleaner, a Wind Tunnel Vac and a hard surface floor cleaning machine.The Wind Tunnel's belt broke after a few hours of use, requiring replacement. Hassle.The SteamVac Carpet Cleaner broke after about ten hours of use. More hassle and expense because the thing just went out of Warranty.Want service? Good luck. Take the machine to a service center and leave it with them for two weeks, then pay them for repairing a machine that should never have gotten out of the factory.Where is the convenience of owning your own carpet cleaning machine? It's gone.My experience? Hoover quality and customer service are terrible."
2,Great when it works...,"I have owned this steam vac for 5 years and am about to replace the watertank for the 3rd time because it is leaking again. The little spring breaks after just a few uses. I am one who treats all my appliances very gently and follow directions to a ""T"" so I know it is the machine. I will replace the tank again if I am able to and if it breaks again that is it. For the amount of $ these cost they should not break so easily."
2,works great but will break down... do not buy!!!,"This product works great it picks of most of water but the carpet cleaner will not last after 1 year of use. The main culprit is the plastic water tanks. I have owned my machine for 4 years and I replaced it 3 times. The good thing is that its parts are available everywhere.... which I not sure its a good or bad thing.... Maybe the Hoover knows of these flaws and its creating an aftermarket demand on parts... and believe me they are not cheap. Each water tank is $50 to $70 so with what I have already spent. I could of bought a new one. I also had to replace rusted parts inside the machine. In conclusion, its the best cleaner out there but its just cheaply made out of plastic that will crack in time and leak all over the place... which causes parts to rust inside the machine."
2,Buy Extra Water Tank!!!!!!!!!,I have owned Hoover products since 1970. This is the first piece of junk I've ever gotten from them. The clean water tank is worthless. It leaks everywhere. I have 4 dogs. I NEED my rug cleaner just to get doggy body odor out of the rugs. The water tank spews enough water from its leaks to make you think a dog has pizzled on the rugs and floors. Needless to say... you can't get a replacement part because they STAY OUT OF STOCK!!!!!!!!!
1,nothing but problems,"I was able to use this cleaner once before it broke. After one use, the spinning brush unit had to be professionally replaced. After second use, the plastic around the clean water tank seal broke spilling water everywhere. I've spent more money and wasted time on this thing than ever envisioned. Next time...I'll be hiring a professional to come do my whole house for portion of the price."
2,Full Of Breaks,"The Incredible Bongo Band is probably not a band most people have heard of, but one of their songs, ""Apache"" is one of the most sampled songs in hip-hop especially by old school acts of the 80's. Run-DMC, LL Cool J, Nas, The Geto Boys, The Ultramagnetic MC's, Grandmaster Flash, KRS-One, Kool Moe Dee and countless others have used the drum break from the song (The Sugarhill Gang had a minor hit with ""Apache Rap""). The group wasn't really a group at all, but a studio concoction of session players who were quickly assembled in 1972 to round out a soundtrack album (the less than memorable The Thing With Two Heads) with two tracks. Those two tracks, ""Bongo Rock"" & ""Bongolia"", led to the full-length album Bongo Rock and the follow-up Return Of The Incredible Bongo Band. If you are a fan of 70's style funk music, then this is an album for you, but mostly it is only notable for the breaks some of the songs provided."
1,Extremely Disappointed!!,"It arrived used - dents, scratches, chips, scuffs, and all. This one fell through the cracks. It took a while to track down the customer service number to call to ensure that I would not be charged return shipping. Overall, it was for the best because I was not impressed with the quality of the balls or storage bag. I opted for a refund and took a chance on a different set."
2,lame carry bag,"I actually returned the item. Description called for a ""molded carry case"" but the set came with this very flimsy vinyl bag that was already ripped open from a mis-sewn seam. I was amazed it got send out with the top of bag open like that. The actually set looked nice, though but I didn't want to have to go and find/buy a small bag to accomodate it."
2,Bag Strap Breaks,"I ordered this set for my husband for Christmas. When we put the balls into the bag, the shoulder strap literally broke off! I have emailed them asking for a new bag several times - with absolutely no response!! Poor customer service! Would not order from this vendor again!"
4,"Looked like a nice set, but...","Looked like a quality bocce ball set. Too bad Amazon didn't pack it better in the box. The plastic storage case took a beating during shipping arriving with broken latches and hinges. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift, so we tried to exchange it but it was no longer in stock. We accepted a refund on the item. Amazon was pleasant to work with for this return. If the product arrived in good condition, I don't think the case's latches would have held up for more than one season anyway."
2,BROKEN/CRACKED ON ARRIVAL,"With delivery, One of the bocce balls has a large crack/indentation which is damaged before use. Additionally the bag which contains the set has a broken/ripped zipper.Not what you would expect for a mid range priced product. Immediately on it's way back to Amazon.Damaged before use goes along with what other posters have commented on. Just not good quality! I took a chance hoping for a decent product but now I would recommend avoiding!"
1,This product has very poor quality,"I've had a set from another manufacturer for 12 years. I decided to get another set for the cabin, but the very first time we used the set 2 balls broke wide open. We were just playing on a course that had a few spots of river rock and we were not tossing the balls out of control. We've played the same course with the old set with damage what so ever."
3,OK read but some parts ridiculous,"I read it to the end and I did enjoy it. Although, I thought several parts were really foolish and just highly unlikely. It just seemed they would throw some love and sex in there to keep it interesting (but really out of place). The ending? PLEASE - I don't think so. They just went to far over the edge with that one. And the gorgeous cop that just happened to make lots of money and went back to being a cop? LOL"
2,Below Average.,"Have to wonder whether these reviews (""keeps getting better"") are on the level. Overlong and most trifling of whodunits. Not romantic, not racy, no courtroom, no surprises, Juvenile reading level."
5,Christiane Heggan pens another winner!,"There's just something about the lead characters in Moment of Truth that I find very appealing. I would love to see this duo become a series in Ms. Heggan's capable hands. There's plenty of suspense to keep any mystery reader happy, and the romance between Kate and Mitch will appeal to those looking for a great romantic suspense. I highly recommend this book."
1,who will read this edition?,"This is only the only story in a very slim edition, accompanied with outrageously gargantuan chapter numbers and first-letter-of-sentence characters at the beginning of every chapter. The typesetting is quite ugly, but the story is classic and holds the attention. One can find the story elsewhere: in the Penguin Classics and Dover editions with other fine Algernon oddities. This book is overpriced, as is the The Wendigo, by the same publisher. For its price, you should have more to read, in a better layout."
4,Lovecraft fans will love this one,"An excellent longer short story! Almost a novella. I've read that Lovecraft considered this his favorite short story, and it's no wonder why. Blackwood's tale here has a very Lovecraftian feel to it, and I'm not surprised it had a major influence upon Lovecraft the writer. Published in 1907, modern readers might find this tale a bit slow, as I did at first, but it does get going in an eerie fashion that is quite superb. Truly glad I read this one."
2,Fine for beginning foodies but not for educational purposes,"While comprehensive, this is too broad, too general and very stereotypical. Each 'cultural' group represented in the United States has the same diet as their fellows, it seems. It can also be very bland: since coming to the U.S., X group's consumption of 'junk' food, milk, and such, has increased.There are also some serious mistakes. Scotch is the alcoholic drink while Scottish refers to the people. Yet, the authors insist on calling a particular people the ""Scotch Irish"" (a group not recognized in Europe).Should you want very general information, without consulting specialist sources, this might be adequate for your purposes, but if it is to be used in, say, a course introducing topics of food and culture, this is not the book to use."
3,PC Controller,"I can't complain about it, but the lateral control did leave me wanting. The USB plugin works and most games except it."
5,Entsol Spray Review,"This product is easy to use, no mixing or pouring, therefore I use it more often than the netty pot way of nasal cleansing."
5,Great Product!,"This is a very effective saline spray. I have a lot of sinus problems and this is the only product that really clears the congestion, possibly because of the delivery system."
3,Overpriced and better subsitutes now,"While Entsol is a good product, it got expensive. I ordered it because it does work well to irrigate and clean stubborn sinuses, like mine, when I'm sick. The day after I ordered it, I discovered another product as good for less than half the $$!! Isn't that the way it goes? I'm not sure I can mention the other product, but it doesn't come across the ocean to get here, if you catch my drift. Since it does what it's supposed to but $$, I gave it 3 stars. Try finding American products at local pharmacies first, though."
4,hagerty spray,"Now this spray helps me sleep an wake up without a headache .Try it for yourself,it works.Get a bottle."
2,Not very good,"What a disappointing book. There's nothing new here at all, and it's a chore to get through this book even though it's awfully short. There are also a number of factual errors. Don't waste your money."
2,Not complete....Not necessarily Martial Arts based...DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"Bought this book with the idea that maybe it contain methods, ideas, or techniques to improve martial ability, but it turned out to be a basic cardio, resistance training primer. It has a lot of holes in its presentation and really needs some intense updating to discuss how to design, evaluate and adapt a workout program. The majority of this book is a how-to guide on doing exercises. Whoopy!!!! You can go to any internet site and get that info.This book needs more discussion on how to actually do and design workouts; not learn exercise forms. Besides, the only useful part of the book is that is does a very brief evaluation of the kids of training a martial artist would/should do for their style, but again too broad and no useful take away info.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!"
1,Old school work out book,"This book is dated. It's old and out of date information about working out is not helpful. Based on the cover it appears to be just the ticket for a martial artist wanting to build strength, but the reality is that this book is a blast from the past. After reading it I found that I had been transported to the 70s and that I would also have to purchase a complete universal gym as well as some odd medicine balls and Gawd knows what else. I do not feel it is useful book."
2,Never once does the author suggest you READ to your CHILD (m,"Never once does the author suggest you read TO your CHILD - that is what I didn't like about this book. I bought the whole series, hook, line and sinker, the kits, the 'bits of knowledge' the dot cards - all of it. It dawned on me very slowly while reading this book that Doman didn't talk about reading TO your child at all.My daughter is five years old and reads at a 6th grade level, and we did not use this program. Doman never once mentions the library, books on tape or any 'great books' you can read together. His own that come with the kits for your child to 'read' are terrible, poorly illustrated and stilted because of the controlled vocabulary.Don't waste you money on this book. Buy some great kid's books instead and read, read, read TO your child."
4,A taste of rain: a love poem collection,"...And This Too Shall Pass ~ A Poetic Gallery ~When I started reading my book, I was thinking to myself ""oh another poem book. BUT, it was more then that, I nearly saw life flashing before my eyes. Mrs. Guyette thank you for saying things that most are thinking and just don't know how to express themselves. I look forward to reading your next book.Awaiting Margie"

5,"Darling planner, one problem...","LOVE this planner, got it last Christmas from another bad-girl. I absolutely agree with everyone about the stickers, to-do & to-don't lists, and especially the fact that one can write in the week. I am having a problem though, I've run out of my weekly sheets! Does anyone know where I can get anymore? Currently I am scouring the web for planner re-fills. I'll check back on the site, thanks! :)"
3,"I laughed, I laughed some more!",It was good while it lasted. A fun little planner for the wild rebellious young woman in your life. I recommend it.
4,great planner,"This is a really cute planner, it's very girly but it doesn't have a lot of room for appointments! Other than that it does have a lot of writing room for notes and other things."
2,Walter Murphy - Selections From Valentino Library Vol # 6090 Destroyed,"I do not own this but just heard the samples, and I gotta say I was laughing my a** off and saddened at the same time.First, this is nothing more than some never released great works from Walter Murphy with some clown talking over it - give credit where credit is due mr. ""Kimbo"" (whatever a Kimbo is). 90% of the cuts were taken from Valentino Library Vol #6090 (recorded late 1975).Second, this is obviously a horrable needle drop from an old record (listen to the samples - clicks and all with a lackluster stylus).Third, it is in mono, not even stereo.The only reason I think this even deserves 2 stars is because it includes the original Murphy cuts un-tampered with under their REAL titles following this goofy sounding kids record..hence, giving it some commercial exposure (even though in mono from a bad needle drop).I'm adding proper search tags to this listing for the benefit of W. Murphy and his fans."
3,A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE FLU PANDEMIC,"THIS BOOK IS A EXCELLENT HALF HOUR READ OF WHAT HAPPENED IN 1918,IT OPENED UP ALOT OF THOUGHT FOR ME ABOUT THE CAUSE AND CONDITIONS OF THE PANDEMIC. IT IS A GOOD FIRST READ IF YOU KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE PANDEMIC"
4,Well-conceived work,"First two reviewers are right-on. If you liked this and can find it, I highly recommend Britt's ""Helen's Gift"" - I think it's an earlier work. Though in some ways it's not so polished, it is a very fascinating & entertaining story based upon the DB Cooper hijacking. Some would (jokingly?) say the story parallels too well, and that Britt was Cooper."
5,Great book for those preparing to charter,"I obtained copy by emailing my order to books@mind.net This is a great book for those wishing to take a sailing charter with or without crew. I ordered copies for all my friends and ""crew""."
5,Best book on vacation sailing,This is an outstanding guide for the novice sailor giving great tips on chartering a boat for the adventure of a lifetime. I wish the publishers would reissue this book. I've been trying to find copies for friends for some time.
5,It Works Perfectly!,"I purchased the driver side mirror and installed in ten minutes, perfect! Well Done! Must buy the passenger side now to match them!"
2,You get what you paid for!,"I bought it a couple of months ago after reading all the good reviews. My expectation was probably too high for the price. Just so so sound quality that you can get from auto speakers. Again, not terribly bad considering money, but if you want nice home theater quality, I recommend investing a little bit more and go to other speaker sets."
3,"OK, but...","For many years I have lived with Mary-Louise Boehnm's recording of this work on Vox. But the orchestral contribution was just there, and with a concerto like this, it is very important. So many times the orchestra has the most important material while the pianist is accompanying. This recording has much better sound, and the orchestra is more audible, but the conductor needs to move things along a little bit more. It just seems to need a little more movement in order to make this performance effective. It is beautiful, but there is more to this concerto that that. I heartily recommend Alan Feinberg's recording of this on Naxos. That recording is the one we have all been waiting for. Maybe as I get older I will appreciate the Polk performance more, but it is Feinberg's that I will return to most often."
4,about what i expected,"The case is nicely sewn. I personally would prefer the lid to be a little bit more snug, but I realize there's a compromise for usability and it can't be TOO tight. I'd recommend getting it if you need something like this."
5,Just Right for the Church Pot luck Dinner,"This item is just the ticket to prepare, pack, protect, and portage that famous dish everyone will be asking the recipe for at your next pot luck dinner. The hot/cold packs keep the contents hot or cold for several hours saving standing in line for the oven/microwave/refridgerator. An excellent value. An exceptional convenience."
5,bought several,I bought 3 of these since it was such a great price. I've used one as a gift and will probably gift the third eventually. I've used mine several times and couldn't be happier with it. It makes bringing food for potlucks (or keeping food warm or cold at parties) so much easier.
1,Example of a good horrible book!!!!,"Lot of good theories, i wouldn't casll it a book of ""strategies"" though, the BIGGEST turn off is the sample-code, it only ships with .aspx page, no code-behind!!!!!!!!!!! It's all in-line coding (tradition ASP style) and you can not debug anything since there is no solution!!!! If you let IDE handle code-behind, it doesn't behave as expected :( I can not tell you HOW FRUSTRATING it is not to be able to ""run"" the code, all you can do is make a virtual directory, point it to the folder where you downloaded examples and then ""look"" the code by entering urls manually!!!! That is it!! It's REALLY annoying and i could've given negative rating but 1 was the lowest so....anyways, i would not buy anything like this, i got this for free from microsoft seminar (No wonder it's free!! ;-) lolz)Save your time and money for something better :)"
5,Chant-tootsie!,"I think I've always liked the idea of Piaf better than the actuality. Here I risk Francophile wrath, but she seemed a little too mannered in her anguish and diffidence. Claire Gignac is a different story. Out Piaf-ing Piaf in ""Hymne a l'amour,"" she mixes smoldering intensity with an entirely believable passion as she surveys a range of love songs that spans many centuries. From a spare setting (her own) of lyrics by Arthurian balladeer Chretien de Troyes to a modern, Leo Ferre take on a Beaudelaire lyric, it's a brilliantly chosen program that's rendered amidst a jazz/cabaret combo with shades of the old Reinhardt-Grappelli collaborations. These performances don't just draw you in -- they engulf you, going straight to the heart. Gignac's voice is husky and very expressive, with a kind of ""oh, honey, you don't want to know"" quality to the storytelling that lurks behind these songs. Open yourself up to this recording and it'll pack a ""Winterreise""-like punch."
4,Gripping Storytelling,"Many reviewers complain that this story parts from reality, which certainly is the case, but then what is the reality of a drug addicted bounty hunter?All criticism aside regarding fact vs. fiction, this film is both refreshing and gripping in its storytelling. The gritty editing, use of color and music and non-linear plot all work together to make this a solid film. Lots of fine acting too!"
2,"Style trumps substance, and logic loses","I usually like Tony Scott's films, but in this case he got so carried away with style that he forgot he was telling a story with characters. What's happening? Who cares? It's like a 128-minute music video without logic, motivation, or a narrative. The actors do their best, but they're swamped by the toss-everything-up-in-the-air-and-play-it-as-it-lands editing style. An absolute mess of a film."
2,If you like that kind of thing...,"If you (like me) really enjoyed Tony Scotts movie before this, ""Man on Fire""You might expect this to be another gritty violent believable tale worthy of an evening's investment...You would do better to ask yourself what was every Mickey Rourke movie you ever saw like?This is a very cheesy, very violent ""Terentinoesque"" kind of film with stilted performances, terrible dialogue, and mostly unbelievable story line which is odd, since it is a story with some basis in fact. Go figure.If you are a teenage boy with some issues... you might enjoy this movie; if not I'd give it a pass."
1,what a mess,Gave me a headache and after watching all that I could stand I fast forwarded through the rest. What a mess of what could have been a great life story.
1,Big time disappointment,"I'm a big fan of off beat unconventional movies with lots of action and twisting plotlines but was totaly disappointed by this movie. Don't waste your money! If you're really interested, go rent it; but for gods sake don't buy this movie! With the cast, money and story potential this movie started with somebody really dropped the ball to end up with this end result."
2,It started off ok....but then what happened?,"A female bounty hunter movie is a very cool idea. The movie draws you in immediately, than slowly lets you down with a scrambled story line, and very slow spots in between. You will start off saying ""this looks like it is going to be cool"" then you will slowly sink in or chair trying to fight off sleep. Acting was good, picture and sound quality was goodVerdict: If your looking for a vigilante type of movie, than I would go with something like ""The Crow"" or ""The Punisher"" This movie misses the mark by a long shot. Way off base!"
2,I wanted to like it...,"Keira Knightley with guns and a bad ass attitude. This should be a no brainer. But I turned it off in the middle, when I'm watching Queen Latifah!? Queen Latifah?! I mean, I want to see Keira and her posse, not get bogged down in the drivle of this script and the connection of a million random characters. I wanted to like it. But I wanted to see Keira Knightley kick some ass and then strike a pose."
5,Domino (movie),I had bought this movie used at Fat Cats in Boone and it played almost half of it so I to get another copy. I love amazon because movie prices they're reasonable and you can ALWAYS find what you want.
1,Could Not Stand It,"This might have been a good movie, but I gave up after 15-20 minutes because the editing and filming style so detracted from the story that I couldn't pay attention to it. I loved the idea of the story of Domino and Keira playing her, of course, but it was all shake and shadow and weird lighting and quick cuts and, after a while, it wasn't worth the pain.Unless you like this kind of filming and editing, I wouldn't bother with it. Most likely, the director thought he was being keen and cutting edge, but there comes a time when the process gets in the way of the storytelling...and this is one of those times."
4,Not bad,Just watch it dont pay attention to all the reviews its a good movie fast paced good music and interesting.
4,Entertaining,"This is a crazy, entertaining mess of a movie. It has drugs, guns, violence, sex, all kinds of exciting stuff. It is, however, almost impossible to keep track of the chaotic plot which bounces around in time and characters, so you kind of have to just sit back and enjoy the action. Definitely aimed at a mature audience. Still once of my favorites, definitely recommend if you're bored."
4,Regional Differences,"I had purchased this as a DVD in Asia years ago.I liked it enough to buy it again as a Blu-ray, so that tells you a lot about the movie right there.Funny thing was (for me), that the dialog is somewhat different all throughout the movie, noticeably if you have watched another edit of the film about 6 times. There is a good chance this will apply to precisely no other people buying this movie, and really it did not detract from the film at all, nor does it change the plot/ending, just made it an odd thing for me to watch, i wanted to get another TV with the DVD hooked up and compare them side by side.....It is a good film with a really superb cast, it action packed and guns and kick'in ass... and she's very hot... and it's cheap, so worst case if you hate it, give it to your enemy!"
1,scratched disc,at first i was really upset because when i recieved my movie it was all scratched up but once i watched it the lovie worked fine and played all the way through without any skips
1,What A Wonderful Opportunity...LOST/WASTED,"I don't want to denigrate Tony Scott as a terrific and talented guy, but DOMINO is probably one of the 10 worst big-budget films I've seen in a long, long time. The story of Bounty Hunter, Domino Harvey, is a very interesting story. Just achingly full of potential for an excellent writer,director, and EDITOR(s) to make a fantastic movie from.Some years ago, HBOFilms did a movie based on the life and times of theUSA's first supermodel,Gia Carangi. Angelina Jolie played the lead role in this movie ( the title was GIA ). What a GREAT movie. Genres aside, I do believe that Domino Harvey's story--""rich English girl becomes topnotch bounty hunter""--had this potential. It's too bad it couldn't have been done this way!!!"
4,Looking for acceptance in wrong places,"I have stumbled across this movie by accident and decided to watch it because of the stars featured in it: Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken to name a few. It is a story of the young woman lost upon untimely death of her father. Craving love, acceptance and trying to make her own way in the real world, Domino opts to become a bounty hunter - the least likely place for a girl with her background. It is an ultimate rebellion effort towards her mother, people she is surrounded with day in and day out and her attempt for self-acceptance by acting out tough. I did not know that Ms. Domino Harvey has died of an overdose in 2005 until I researched her a bit more, after learning that movie is based on the real person and real events. This young lady definitely lived her life on her own terms - this world was just too small for her."
5,Awesome with great acting!,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I love Keira and Mickey, and they crazy directing is so good. I watched it twice in a row it was so good!"
1,Pathetic,"I was very interested in list of actors that participated in this film, I always like to see Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken, Kyrie Sedgewick, Lucy Liu, Delroy Lindo etc. etc...... That said, I was unable to watch this travesty to the end.....BOOH"
2,A movie that tries to be too many things at one time!,"This movie doesn't do it for me. The main problem is that too many genres are involved in this DVD. At times it seems like the producers are trying to mix action, thriller, and gangster movie scenes into this movie, which give the viewer the idea that this movie can't make up its mind about what it really wants to be! Also the story seemed to be too contrived for my taste, and was thus not convincing, especially with a female bounty hunter playing the protagonist."
1,Horrible,Not even worth watching for free. Terrible. Horrible. Very Bad. Should never have been made. Waste of time. Crap. Trash. Couldn't even finish it.
2,Not a clue what this was meant to be about,"This was recommended by a friend, and I do love anything that Keira Knightley does - but this film is awful.The idea, and story idea, sounded great - a female bounty hunter, that is based on a true story.Yet, apart from a very good performance by Keira, this film is a let down from start to finish. The constant chop chop of the film makes it feel as though you have taken something. The film is boring, unbelievable and tediously overdone."
3,"Lock, Loaded, and LOADED","Hardcore gritty action packed film with more twists and turns than expected. It was a fun movie to watch but not one I would watch again. The movie doesn't really make it from point A to point B, it just circulates between the two. In my opinion it misses the mark completely, but it was fun to watch in the process. My Suggestion: Rent it, don't buy it."
2,Crazy,"This movie is incredibly bad - so bad, it's almost good. I only bought the DVD because of Keira Knightley, and she doesn't disappoint. She's one of the most beautiful women on earth and she certainly looks her best in the movie. Her lap dance scene is breathtaking. She doesn't even remotely resemble the real Domino Harvey though. Mickey Rourke gives a very believable, gritty performance, but Christopher Walken is just plain nuts.Anyone who loves a rocking shoot-em-up action film won't be disappointed, just be warned that it's pretty far out there and you'll need to put reality on hold for the 128 minutes of this movie."
1,One of the Worst Movies of 2005,Domino was one of the single worst movies of 2005. It was also the subject of a bait and switch advertising campaign. This movie was billed as a based on real life adventure movie about a fashion model who bebame a bounty hunter. Domino is anything but that.Domino is an exercise in Hollywood indulgence in death and violence and being as sick and disgusting as possible while avoiding the NC-17 rating. It was utterly vile and features what may well be the single most violent dismemberment scene ever committed to film.Moviegoers should boycott all future flicks made by any of the people involved with this movie. The people who made this wretched excuse for a motion picture are nothing but vile scum who would be involved in any movie project just for the money and for no other consideration but the money.
2,Waste of Blu-Ray,"The director felt that to make a good movie you tint it yellow and green, sometimes make the shots dimly lit with a sort of strob like effect, don't stay on a single shot for more than 3.5 nano-seconds, and use a clever dialog consisting mostly of the same four letter word over and over again. It just did not work for me. I never made it to the end."
2,The DOMINO has FALLEN!,"If this film had not claimed it was based ""on a true story...sort of"" right at the opening, I would have thought it's faily entertaining.It became a bad joke when one person had his whole right arm shot off by one of Domino fellow bounty hunters. Yet, he's still able to shout loudly to his mother asking her to give the hunters the money! There are quite a few nonsense scenes like that.There is a lot of shooting and action. If you're watching it for facts, you'll be disappointed. If you want entertainment, it will help a little bit. Overall, it's disappointing."
4,"starts off fast, and slows down just enough for you to catch your breath","first of all-AWESOME SOUND COMING OUT OF THIS THING, I live in an apartment and I had the bass down all the way and it was still pretty loud. I always have problems with movies being too quiet during the dialog scenes and also when nothing is really happening. Don't worry about adjusting the volume on this, because I heard every word that was said without adjusting my sound and it wasn't too loud for the neighbors either.Overall this movie is very stylish, but just when you think that there gonna over do it, they tone it down just enough to get a nice flow, and the movie comes together real nice by the end of it. Also the chinegro and japanic scene was the funniest thing that I have seen in a movie of all time.Keira Knightley is naked in this, it's only a second or so, but well worthit. Enjoy, very good movie."
1,THE worst film of Tony Scott's career.,Domino has to be one of the DUMBEST films to come out in 2005. The lapdance scene alone was so ridiculously stupid to the point where you're laughing out loud. After the first 30 minutes I watched the rest of it in 2x fas forward mode. Didn't iss a thing. Asinine.
4,A Wonderful New China!,"This book is a ""dilly of a book"", and I couldn't believe how much I had missed China. Ms. Albert cannot write these books fast enough for my taste. This is a great China Bayles book. In it China is trying to find the killer of a local business lady who runs a pickle factory. As she delves deeper into the past, she finds more suspects and motives for murder than she knows what to do with. In the book we see some of our favourites-Ruby, Janice, McQuaid, but we also see China, and that's what makes this series. Reading this book is like catching up with some old friends. There's also some fabulous recipes in the book."
3,Local gossip,"Mixed in with this gossipy account of life in a small town, a friend's pregnant daughter shows up at a woman's door looking for a place to stay, the woman's husband decides on a career change to become a private investigator, a local festival is rained out, and a woman's body turns up - apparently murdered.It's OK if you like this type novel. I found myself skimming past some of the gossip to try to get on with the story. So, three stars, but not outstanding.There are some recipes mixed into the book here and there as a bonus, and you learn a lot about pickles."
5,Great vitamins!,"These vitamins are a nice addition to my daily nutritional regimen. They are very gently on the stomach, which is a great plus compared to a lot of other brands out there. Since starting these, I feel more energetic, and have noticed a nice overall difference in how I feel. I will continue to use these!"
4,6 tablets,"The actual content, minerals and vitamins are great, but having to take 6 tablets to constitute 1 serving is not really convenient."
1,Dangerous!,"I purchased this toy for a friend's dog a while back. The dog loved it, he played with it non-stop (quack! quack!). When he finally destroyed it though we were shocked. Inside of this toy in addition to the stuffing we found a rubber band and parts of a plastic bag. My friend was fortunate enough to get the toy away from the dog before he could consume these items. We did complain to the manufacturer who said they'd look into it, but I would still be wary of this toy.I think this would be a great toy for a dog that loves it's toys, but doesn't rip them to shreds! There is no guarantee that what you find inside will be safe!"
5,Santa Baby,"This CD was requested by our Granddaughter, mainly for the song, ""Santa Baby."" Our Granddaughter ended up falling in love with all the songs on this CD."
5,the best,"I've been using this product for over two years and it works great. Unlike any other lip balm this stuff last and last in the little tin. It doesn't melt or leak. I keep in my pocket and have never had a problem with melting. I live in the Wasatch Mountains and it can get dry, windy, and cold. I bought the big size by mistake and use the smaller size to carry with me. This product is worth the extra dollars"
1,buy the real thing from olympus,"I tried this from 47th street direct - somehow I thought it broke my body and I went into a panic. I switched to the factory lens and matched the focal length then did an MTF comparison between the two with a 5.4 degree diagonal 10% - 90% brightness transition. The MTF curves were proof that the lens was truly junk. Often MTF values at F/8 dropped to 30. Wide open the MTF dropped to 18 and was a wavy line. Having evaluated it I returned it and stayed with OLY's lens, which all things considered isn't that bad. Don't bother with this one - you'll wonder why things are not working. Perhaps the more expensive sigmas are worth it"
5,Better than Zuiko 14-42mm,"I've been using the Zuiko 14-42mm for over 3 years now on my Olympus evolt e-300 , and the Sigma 18-50mm lens is far better. I have just recently got it and have used it many times. It's now become my favorite lens.The Auto Focus is far faster, the Manual Focus is very smooth. It's easy to switch from one another with a click of the button. The images are clearer and the focusing is amazing on it for selective focusing. Fits good in the hand and everything turns and moves smooth.The price is amazing.Only problem I see, is it feels delicate compared to the Zuiko and the shipping was not 2-3 days like I order, more like 8 but it's all good.-Matt"
2,"It was nice, but just okay",i didn't get into this game like others. It seems way outdated and not up to todays standards in any department. I would rather have bought something else
5,A phenomenal experience,"I am writing this quick review having finished this game for the first time after having been a long-time fan of the series. It has easily become my favorite RPG series of all time, even above that of Final Fantasy.If you enjoy a good story, you will get an amazing one. The gameplay is fun, and the graphics are gorgeous. While the second game is lacking in several departments, this installment is more breathtaking than the first two combined and totals to be an unforgettable series, and one worth keeping in anyone's permanent game library. I only hope that someday in the future the trilogy is expanded upon, as it is the most complex universe with the most complex characters and story you would ever find-- and a most enjoyable one.The bottom line: play it! It's more than worth its cost. I do recommend playing the first two games of the series first, however, or else many things will be extremely confusing."
5,Sony PS2 game,"When I saw this particular ad, I did not realize that they had made a third installment of the game. So I immediately ordered it for my collection. The seller shipped it out quickly. It arrived to my location in excellent shape. I would purchase again from this seller. Excellent job!!!"
5,Best Game of the Best RPG Series,"This third, final, and best episode of the Xenosaga series, marks the high point in RPG production by successfully interweaving the crucial elements of RPGs; storytelling, character development, music, animation, and action. Foreshadowing is used throughout the series to connect to the struggle of the heroine, a young scientist named Shion. Side-narratives flesh out the backgrounds of the supporting cast unlike any other RPG I have encountered. This game has the most richly-detailed story spanning events thousands of years in the past to the present, but the heart of the game is in the development of Shion as a protagonist and the philosophical themes flawlessly incorporated into the plot and emotionally enhanced by outstanding music, voice-acting and cut-scenes. I look forward to encountering an RPG series that can rival Xenosaga in terms of artistic achievement but I suspect that will not be for a long time."
5,NOT A TOY! This is an excellent Halloween prop!,"First, I'm not sure what product A. Serra was writing a review for, but their review in no way describes this product. I purchased this product from PartyMagic through Amazon.com. It is the product shown in the picture provided by the seller, although mine has a different angle for the head. I am including a photo of the item I purchased. This item has the detail you'd expect for a low price Halloween prop, and would be a great addition for anyone with a zombie theme for their graveyard. I would not recommend keeping outside for extended periods of time though, as the outfit is made of real cloth which may get ruined by rain."
2,Disappointed,"Had high hopes for this prop, it could've been better, but when whoever packed it used a box too small and just shoved it in there. So when I finally received it, needless to say it was all crippled up. To sad"
3,Interesting and nice but not amazing,"An interesting opera from a master composer. regrettably, the audio is disappointing. A recording done in 2006 shouldn't be so flat as this one. The singers are not exceptional but good enough. Corbelli is a very good Sancho and brings lot's of life to the performance.Still, it is the only DVD recording I know of and a good way to know this opera."
5,"Very helpful and informative. Take heed, your health matters","Every person who cares enough about health and longevity needs to read and heed. Take charge of what goes into your body and gain better health and longer, more energetic life. This is especially true for parents who have an opportunity AND a responsibility to provide the best teaching and good health for their children."
4,"Classic Schoolhouse, but better.","I watched this DVD because I am absolutely obsessed with Schoolhouse Rock, and politics, so it only seemed fair to give it a shot.It gives some of the great classics, such as ""I'm just a bill"" and the ""I'm gonna send your vote to college""The graphics are restored, and the sound is as well, so it looks and sounds great.The only thing I was disappointed in was the 2 ""surprise"" endings. They weren't amazing. Like 20 seconds, and nothing too spectacular.Of course the DVD comes with a few things, like an election tracking kit, which, seeing how the election isn't until Tuesday, I haven't used yet. Looks cool though. Lots of stickers. =]Overall, worth the money. Especially since it includes the classics."
4,"Gimmick? Yeah, but...","I should have a sucker tattoo on my forehead. Schoolhouse rock completionists should buy this DVD. Otherwise, stay away. The menus are cute, and arranged strangely. Some of these segments fit nicely, but some don't at all. If, however, you're interested in a new perspective on an old set - you're not getting much here. I'm a little upset about the price - under $10 could've pushed this further, but I did but all of the VHS sets around $10. I figured that I was already in this thing above $50 anyways, so another $15...The new song is cute, and clocks in at about 60 seconds. It does fit nicely in with all of the other pieces of the pie. (Know how busy prepositions, the money segments, and even Mr. Morton kinda don't quite fit?) This harkens back to that late 70's feel...As for the surprise ending? I don't wanna spoil it, but they're NEARLY identical.Worth it for the completionist, not so much for anyone else..."
3,Nice Read,"This was well done, with the exception of overly long paragraphs of introspection by both of the main characters. This made them seem whiney. Also, the noun ""quirk"" used as a verb was annoying. It was a good story with a great plot, though. It was also edited well, with a minimum of errors. For me, this is important to the enjoyment of any story."
4,Thought provoking,A good read with the right amount of suspense and intrigue to keep one up till the wee hours of morning.
5,Nice way to pass a rainy day,"Combined my love of great food, renovations, & a dream of running a B&B. Looking forward to reading the sequel!"
4,Page-turner,"It took me a chapter or so to get into this book, but I was hooked as soon as Lance met Rese. Though the characters frustrated me at times, they behaved as so many do in life, withholding important truths from each other. The story was engrossing and the characters were complex enough to keep me reading well into the night, and then coming back the next night for more."
3,"Started out good, but dragged on.","I was excited about this book when I first started reading it. It was mysterious, and little romance mixed in, and since it takes place in Sonoma, there are lots of references to wine and food. Then the book sort of lost me about halfway through. The mystery portion got put on the back burner, and the relationship stuff took the front seat. The characters eventually became predictable and annoying. Then there was a whole Jesus/religion thing thrown in that really didn't seem to fit well in the book. I felt like I was being taught a lesson on faith. It ends abruptly with no real conclusion, and I do not plan to read the sequels. I barely wanted to finish this book."
3,Life is but an art.,It is an art to be able to keep secrets. That is how the book flows. I don't like secrets.
3,Disappointing!,"This book started out really good but as the story continued it became very repetative and I found myself skimming quite a bit. The ""mystery"" so far is quite weak and I really hope that the other two books will redeem the story for me."
2,Not what I expected ...,"I have loved other books by this author, but this one was much too repetitious and long. While the story itself was interesting, because of the repetitive nature of the book, I skipped a lot of the descriptive narrative."
1,For Catholics only,"I would not recommend reading this unless you are a devout Catholic. Though it was fairly well written, I am not Catholic and had to skip over many parts."
2,Stealth preaching,"I felt a little blind sided by the Christian aspect of this book. I loved how it started. The Italian heritage really hit home. The meals sounded delicious. Then it started. A little at first, and then what I felt was way over the top so as to be unbelievable. It actually made me feel like I was being taken advantage of. Like the hook was in, and now I'm expected to finish it to see what happens - while the author preaches to me right up until the end. I skipped ahead just to see how it ended. Actually made me wonder about the free books on Amazon."
4,Another Great Read,"I have read Freefall and loved it. When Secrets came out I had to read it too. I was not disappointed. I loved the story and the characters. They were genuine. The mystery is just icing on the cake. Christian fiction can be done well, okay, and way off. This author is not preachy but allows the lives of her characters to make the point. I like that! I will be adding this author to a list of favorites."
5,I am Jewish but do not mind Christian,"So I just bought the book. I only care about well written prose, a good plot and great characters. Looking forward tp reading this book."
1,Evangelism is a cheap plot device,"I find it totally tawdry and when an Evangelistic author uses ""God"" as a plot device. I really despise cheap tricks like that."
3,This is a Christian novel,I almost purchased this novel. The plot sounds interesting but I am glad I read the reviews or I would not have known that this is a Christian novel. It would be helpful if that were mentioned in the Book Description since many of us do not wish to read religious novels. Since I was unable to post without giving it a rating I went for the middle ground.
2,Boring!,Story is disjointed and takes way too long to tell. The suffering of the main character wears you down and 'Mr. Goody Two Shoes' can't do enough to get her on track. I put it down 3/4 of the way - I couldn't take anymore.
1,Confused,"First, I am pretty easy to please when it comes to reading. I just appreciate the ""time out"" it allows me from the day to day. That said, this book is a waste of time. Nothing happens or progresses past the first half of the book. I read this on my Kindle (it was a free download). It was at about 50% through that 90% of the book became about religion, the bible and converting non-believers. At 80% through, I decided to read the last two chapters - I NEVER do this. I'm so glad I did. I did not need anything in between to get from where I was to the end. This book is definitely more about ""spreading the Word"" than it is about any sort of story. I'm utterly confused at all the positive reviews."
3,secrets,To much religion in this book for my liking.This was a good story with some mystery and a little romance built in.
2,A good story,"this was an interesting story line with dynamic characters you can relate to. What turned me off, though, was the constant talk about the bible and how god is in control of your life. It really took away from the story and ruined the moment every time."
4,Secrets is intriguing.,I found this to be a good book. It had some mystery. I go wrapped up in the characters and enjoyed reading about characters and their faith. Good read.
4,Interesting story line,This book has a nice story to it. It keeps ones interest in all the way through. Will be reading the next one in this series soon.
5,One of my favorites,"I couldn't put this book down. It was free to me so i thought i'd give it a try. The story line is mysterious and intriguing, never slow, the characters are diverse and the faith base is just strong enough, not over the top, not preachy. I just bought #2 in the series and so far so good, can't wait to really get into it."
5,A Great Christian Romance Mystery,This is the first book I have read by Kristen Heitzmann and I definitely plan on reading the Michelli Family Series Book #2! it is one of the best books I have read and couldn't wait to read every night. Normally I do not have a problem with word meanings but there were a few in this book. The constant volatile relationship between Lance and Rese got tiring. But the descriptions of the gourmet dishes he prepared made me hungry along with other descriptions such as the Bed and Breakfast made me want to stay there and want to see the Sonoma area. Thank you Ms. Heitzmann for this wonderful book! I enjoyed it so much.
5,A favorite,"I've read the hard copy of this book several times, so I was delighted to be able to get it for my Kindle, also. I should warn you, if you read this book, you will definitely want to read the other two books in the series, too, so you may as well get all three right away! I love the character development in this book as well as the others; the characters are well-rounded and multidimensional, and both Lance and Reese break various stereotypes for their genders, so it creates some interesting dynamics throughout the story."
4,Good Read,Not done reading this yet but so far so good. The author did a great job developing the characters and the story line is cohesive.
1,Religious tripe,"The plot would have been acceptable if it wasn't full of irrelevant religious content that detracted from the story and annoyed me no end. Amazon should add another category ""religious crank reading"" to warn readers. Lucky I didn't pay for it as it really wasn't worth the download!"
1,Secrets (The Michelli Family Series book #1),"I READ A FEW CHAPTERS & DELETED THE BOOK, JUST COULDN'T GET INTO IT. NOT THE TYPE OF MYSTERY I LIKE."
2,TOO LONG,I have always loved this author but this book was just too long.The plot and characters are very likable but the story lags in the middle and the last 100 pages I had to force myself to read.I would have really loved had it been 100-150 pages shorter.
5,Secrets,A great story of learning to trust God! I Loved it. I Can't wait to continue the series.Will recommend it to my friends.
5,My Favourite Book,"Secrets is my absolute favourite book. Something about the two main characters of Rese and Lance keep making me pick it up again. My family laughs at the fact that every time I dust my book shelf and my fingers go by it, I have no control. I find myself rereading it once again. The story is interesting, sure, but it is the characters that keep bringing me back. Give it a try, there is a good chance you will enjoy it. I found it refreshing the first time I read it and the 16 people I have lent it to all agreed. Most bought their own copy soon after returning mine. The two sequels (or one sequel and a half, I suppose) are worth it as well."
4,"Stubborn, stubborn woman","After reading the whole series, which I did, and I did enjoy it, my only real complaint is that Rese is so ridiculously difficult. I understand her strength and what she has dealt with it but I don't think there is a woman alive who would take as long as she did to come around. OR, maybe there should have been more stress on the timing of the story, a resistance because they haven't known eachother long, which is also true. But she seems so wishy-washy. It's irritating for someone to be so wishy-washy for TWO AND A HALF BOOKS while the love interest is so completely lovable. Give the man some REASON to like her because she just isn't likable! If I hadn't read the end of the last book before getting into the second, I might have given up."
4,Looking to read the next book,This was a okay book; left a few things hanging so I'm looking forward to reading the next in the series. Was more down to earth - realistic - in the character's interactions with each other than most of the books I've read.
5,Great receipes,A lot of good food programmed in the book. It is always a good read when it shows God's love. I hope the next book will have Resa seeking the Lord. Hard to put this book down
2,"Good premise, distracting editing","In reading ""Secrets"", I was excited as the reviews looked good, and the premise was promising. I am not a stickler for grammar, but the grammar and formatting in this book were very distracting to me. There were symbols instead of letters (not constantly, but enough to be very distracting), and frequently there were sentences that would stop in the middle of the line and continue a line down (like that)! Very frustrating, and it really interrupts the rhythm of reading.I loved the premise of this book and I wanted to like it! I think the characters are fun and lovable, in a beautiful setting, and the story grabs you right away. I am so disappointed! I do not think I can handle reading the second book if it is like the first.All in all I cannot recommend this book, and I really wanted to. :(Maybe the editing and formatting will get all straightened out! That would be lovely!"
5,A Great Read....,Couldn't put it down. The characters draw you into their world immediatlely. Lance's cooking is true art...makes you wish you were there to join them in the meals. It has intrigue and mystery...I enjoyed it immensely.
5,Excellent read,I really like the way Kristen Heitzman writes! Can hardly stop reading once I get started. Can't wait to read the next book in this series!
4,Secrets,It was good to have the male lead a believer in God instead of it always being the female. Looking foreward to Book #2.
5,Great story.,Loved the whole thing. I love a good mystery! This was shifting nicely finding the trouble maker. Good ending for all.
5,THIS IS A MUST READ,I LOVED THIS BOOK!!! Not just a typical Christian romance. It has suspence mystery and love story. Can't wait to read her next book
3,Secrets,Enjoyed learning about the secrets of the Michelli family.Looking forward to second installment.Liked the idea of strong families and faith based families.
3,It was an easy read.,I did get frustrated with the main characters never being able to express themselves--no real communication between them. At times you felt like they needed to be told to just say what was on their minds.
4,Slow read occasionally,"I would read more from this author but some parts are hard to follow when she jumps from story to story but they do end up coming together to form a complete picture. Who doesn't love a feel good, heart warming story."
2,Impressed,I enjoyed this book. I was in the mood for something light and it was an easy read. The characters were very real.
5,Left me wanting more!,"This is a beautiful story, beautifully written, about the struggle between two worlds of faith in which we each need to find the wisdom to ask questions, find the truth and more importantly, have the courage to live accordingly.The old world style of writing took a couple chapters to get used to but once I did, the chapters flowed and all I wanted to do was be left alone to read this book from start to finish. I slowed down toward the final chapters as I did not want the book to end. I was left wanting more and wish there was a companion book that picks up where this left off. While I had an inclination to the book's ending, I tightly clung to Gwynneve's humble, yet larger-than-life spirit. I will keep this book and read it again as I found it inspiring."
3,Definitely fiction.,"I liked it as a story--even as an alternate universe story, but not as an historical novel. It tries to squeeze the values and world-view of modern-day neopagan feminism into 4th century Ireland.The character also misunderstands Augustine's writings.I liked the plot and the characters, though. It's a good read if it's not taken as seriously as it's meant to be taken."
5,Don't hide your pagan roots,"This book was one of few that I literally couldn't put down. I was interested when looking at the cover, and even more compelled to read it once I saw the title. How can a book touch on both natural pagan ideals and forced christianity at the same time without turning a reader off. Well this one is now on my top 5 books to read! A must for every pagan to explain how it was so easy for the Celts to accept an alien religion. While showing you how quickly that religion twisted and fell upon them, suffocating every natural ideal they held dear. It is also a good wake up call for christians who deny that they still feel their DEEP pagan roots. The ending is MOST surprising, and not only left me in tears, but also applauding the strength of the main character in the face of adversity. Filled with such truth, and brutality, I'm sure you won't put it down either. Let your pagan blood flow free and follow it!"
4,Unexpected Pleasure,"I began the story of Gwynneve with little expectation of what the story may hold. I honestly picked it up at the book store because I have been to Ireland and the photo of the clochan caught my eye. I was thrilled to find the story quite captivating. Although the first couple of pages didn't thrill me, I am delighted that I pressed on. The author writes in a simple style, however, the simplicity of the language holds the beauty of the story. In her simple, small view of the world around her, Gwynneve recites the story of her simple life...a woman raised pagen...trained as a druid and scribe...""converted"" to a Christianity. She experiences life and death, love and loss, and stuggles as the world around her changes. The end of the story is so moving, I actually read the last paragraph twice. I was outraged and saddened. Then I sat back and contemplated who were the truly God-less ones in her tale...the pagans or the Christians???"
1,Historically problematic,"Just the number of times y, w, or v show up in proper names is proof that Gaelic language and culture did not have a stong influence on this book. Gwynneve is simply not an Irish name.RE:""Gwynneve is born into a world suspended between paganism and Christianity: Ireland circa 500 C.E. While the rest of Europe was well on its way toward Christianity, at this time Ireland remained much closer to its pagan traditions""Yes it was a world suspended between paganism and Christianity, but it was Ireland which was well on its way toward Christianity, something large swaths of northern Europe would not be doing for a while yet.Good romantic fantasy? Maybe. Good historical novel? No."
2,Take this off your reading list,"I saw this book on a number of lists which made me think I would like this novel. I had a business trip and plenty of boring time in a lonely hotel room. I just could not get into this book. It's written from the perspective of nun in Ireland in the Dark Ages who grew up pagan but becomes a Christian nun. The perspective of the writing makes this book unique, but I couldn't stand reading it."
3,"V. interesting, but slightly stilted","This novel is not very fast paced, although it is well-written. It is written as a journal, and therefore it makes sense that the narrative is slightly stilted. It comes across almost like a stream of consciousness. A fantastic insight into Ireland at the time that Christianity was becoming the dominant religion. A great historical novel."
3,Beautiful but Gruesome,"Kate Horsley's novel is beautifully written but not for the faint of heart. I had to put it down several times because the descriptions of horrible things that had happened to people and animals were sickening to me. It is probably a sign that her writing drew me in so much that I could not just ""read past"" the tragedies but took them to heart.I would recommend to anyone who just wants to read lyrical, poetic, beautiful fiction that you not become so enchanted with the beauty that you let your guard down because there is a lot of ugliness to follow."
2,Not very well done,"First, let me say that I am amazed at the people that don't understand that when a book says 'a novel' on the front that means fiction. Gwynneve was/is not real and the translator's intro is fake--merely a literary device. This is an historically weak, vague book and the random Gaelic thrown in for perspicuity instead makes it awkward and disjointed. There is no history or research evident and the story is meandering and a bit boring. TryYear of Wonders: A Novel of the Plague,Royal Road to Fotheringhay: The Story of Mary, Queen of Scots,Pope Joan: A Novel,The AlienistorThe Josephine Bonaparte Collection: The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B., Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe, and The Last Great Dance on Earth,Dissolution (Matthew Shardlake Mysteries)orMistress of the Art of Deathfor some better historical fiction."
5,Poetic and incredibly moving.,"""Confessions"" is written in a style that transports the Reader to another age. It isn't often that we get to see the ""Dark Ages"" through the eyes of a woman instead of through the exploits of men in battle. The joys, sorrows, loves, and anguish of the main character are displayed before us, and we cannot help but fall in love with her."
1,Dont buy this Toaster!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The timer mechanism started giving us problems within a few months of purchase. After just over a year it completely stopped working. I just noticed today that Amazon actually resells the timer switches for $23. Thats proof to me of how often this toaster breaks on paople.This toaster was good looking but the quality was awful. We just tossed ours in tha garbage.
1,Disappointing,"I bought two of these at a warehouse clearance (a catalog store for chefs). Therefore I can't return them. The first one didn't work out of the box. The second one quit working within the first 4 hours after being out of the box. Besides not working, they are noisy. Now I have two pieces of junk that I thought would be great, because of the brand name."
1,Poor product!!!,We purchased this DeLonghi toaster oven and both the toaster and oven functions stopped working right after the one year warranty expired. We barely used this product. When it was working the timer was very loud and it was slow. The coating on the broiler pan chipped off shortly after we bought it. When contacting customer service we were told that there were no replacement parts available for our model and there was nothing we could do and nothing they would do for us. My $20 toastmaster lasted more than 15 years! This is the last time I buy a toaster based on appearance! From reading the other reviews on here it looks like this is a common problem with this model and I cannot believe that the company has done nothing to remedy this problem!
5,It's a Keeper !,Characters you won't forget and a story line to tug at your heart. Don't miss this one.
3,A great comedy of the old west,"As far as westerns or comedies go this film is not that great, but as a western comedy this film is absolutely fabulous. It is not dramatic nor is it historical, but funny it is. I watched ""Riders in the Storm"" expecting to see a bunch of gunfighters and saloons in the old west, which is what one would might expect just glancing at the cover, but this movie is far from it. This is a hilarious movie about a few people who set off on a rescue mission in the old west. Your teenage children will never stop laughing as they watch ""Riders in the Storm"" again, and again, and again. For a good laugh, purchase your copy today."
3,*Not* the Gospel according to J.P. Ryan,"Just to make it *absolutely* clear, this was written by a priest from somewhere in the Republic Of Ireland, and not somebody with the same name from Maryland, USA.It is possible that someone may be concurrently interested in the works of both authors; but perhaps not very likely."
3,Johnny Cash,I bought this CD for my 80+ years old Dad and he like the CD and will sing along with the songs.
4,Good but not great...,"I loved the performance by Johnny but it was some of the other acts that were luke warm. Over all a good view, but if you have more DVD's of Johnny, you probably have seen the songs he sings in this version."
5,Johnny Cash/San Quentin,I liked this a little better than Folsom Prison. But both are excellent choices.
5,Johnny Cash was a rebel,"This was Johnny Cash's second live album. Like his first one, this one was recorded in a prison. This is one of the great live albums of county music. Johnny holds the captive audience in the palm of his hand from first note to last. All the songs here are great, but some of the highlights are ""San Quentin"" (two versions), ""Wanted Man"" and the smash hit ""A Boy Named Sue"". This is a great album, and anyone who is intersted in Johnny Cash needs to hear it."
2,"A beautiful presentation, but","It wasn't much help beyond some technicalities of brush work and some reproductions of the artist's work. Okay for a pretty intro. and some history. If your goal is to reproduce someone else's paintings, this book does that; but I want to create my own so Chinese Brush Painting: A Beginner's Guide by Pauline Cherrett, actually gives directions: on how to care for your tools, how to compose your own paintings, how to make your paintings vibrant with energy and spirit, with enough ""what not to do's"" to be truly a useful beginners guide. I don't understand the 5 star ratings on this book. As to technical brush work; Chinese Calligraphy Made Easy: A Structured Course In Creating Beautiful Brush Lettering by Rebecca Yue; gives wonderful step by step directions for brush work that transfers to painting everything else."
3,Chinese PaintingTechniques...and Love is in the Earth: Laying of stones...,"I want to know where is my two (2) books that I bought last month, in 01/07/2008:1 - Chinese PaintingTechniques for exquesite watercolors2 - Love is in the Earth: Laying of stones (Crystals and New Age)"
5,Pure Energy,"Lian Zehn's work is pure energy and he explains his process very well in this book. It is full of color and animation, though the presentations are still photographs. The artist will want to get some spray bottles and get out and splash color on paper."
1,Covers a test that is no longer being offered by Praxis. . .,This book mostly covers the Core Battery which is a test that is no longer being offered by the Praxis Series. I bought the newer 2000 edition and was disgusted to find the small print about the Core Battery no longer being offered by Praxis in 1999. How can they say it is the the most up-to-date book when it covers an obselete test? You do not need this book if you are planning to take any Praxis tests after 1999!
1,A great disappointment,"This book was absolutely horrible. The book deceives you into beleiving it has every PRAXIS test on it, when it only has the Core Battery and vague specialty area tests which were not specific to the area of the Praxis I needed help with. It is 700 pages of predominantly Core Battery Tests which did not help me because I am not taking Core Battery tests. If I could, I would give it zero stars. I felt like I lost my money."
4,Dream On...,"Have you ever had one of those weird dreams that you can't quite explain to people? Jesse Reklaw can help.This book is a compilation of the internet comic strip ""Slow Wave"" in which people write in to tell Jesse about their strange and goofy dreams. He in turn creates a comic strip from those dreams and posts it for everyone to see.Jesse is a visionary as well as a talented cartoonist. He seems to be able to capture the mood and feeling of even the most bizarre dreams. I should know too, the apartment chicken on the cover is one of mine.I highly recommend this book for cartoon fans and anybody who is into general weirdness. These aren't all funny cartoons - after all, some dreams can be quite frightening - but they do make you think."
5,Dream On!,This is a wonderfully witty and sly book. Reklaw captures the absurdity of real-life dreams in his text and drawings. The book appeals to readers on multiple levels -- the humor is remarkable but it also offers a window to the psyche. This seeminly simple book is a very sophisticated tour of the subconscious mind. Absolutely fascinating!
4,"A Chi Kung primer, theory and exercises for the beginner","Chi energy, the universal energy that permeates the universe, can be accessed for health, physical energy, and spiritual energy by anyone willing to regularly perform a few simple exercises. This is the basis for the book ""Chi Kung for Beginners"". Chi Kung is the Chinese science of how to access and use this energy. Instead of lacking physical and mental energy you will learn to access boundless energy almost effortlessly. Besides the details of several specific techniques, the book also has an appendix that covers the most important figures in the history of Chi Kung as well as various theoretical foundations. For the beginner to Chi Kung this provides a sound basic understanding without a lot of fluff or diversions to other unrelated topics that is common in so many books of this type. ""Chi Kung for Beginners"" is a recommended read."
3,Could Be Better,"This was the first book published on Analysis Services 2005. It was obviously rushed to press. At first I started making notes of all the grammatical errors, but then found so many I gave up and quit.The technical content if very good. If you are doing a lot of Analysis Services work then you will definitely want this book. At the same time, you will want to pick up some of the other texts as they're released over the coming months. For one, the coverage of MDX syntax in this book is quite poor. You are also not going to find the ""whys"" of dimension modeling covered here or a set of recommended best practices.Also, the book starts with a sample database and data warehouse and builds upon those samples throughout the book. If you are not looking for the kind of book where you type in the examples in each section, then this one may not be for you."
4,Enclyclopedic Knowledge Of MSAS,"This is an impressive book. Amazing in both its breadth and depth of coverage. If you are working with MSAS, this book will be an invaluable reference.While this book presents a general overview of OLAP and data mining concepts, I think a beginner may want to pick up an addtional book solely dedicated to general OLAP concepts. Also, this book does not provide detailed coverage of MDX.My only complaint would be that the book is sometimes overwhelming. I believe this is due more to the subject matter than Teo's presentation.However, if you are interested in OLAP/Data Mining as it relates to MSAS there is no better book in my opinion. Also of note, Teo covers more than simply using the MSAS thru its GUI. He discusses and gives examples of developing clients to programmatically interact with MSAS. Nice intro and coverage of XMLA also.Highly recommended."
4,"good, but not great","I have 3 SSAS 2005 books in my office, and they are all good but not great. None of them cover everything I need, nor tips on how to handle problems SSAS isn't designed to solve (work-arounds).Not enough help with MDX in this book, considering writing MDX is half the battle of learning to get the most out of SSAS."
3,grammar games and activities,"My dear friends , even though I'm getting to know the book , I've just used a couple of activities so far, I wish that I've been given a more detailed information about the book before I had bought it, such as , a few examples of the type of activities the book contained, nevertheless I must say that I'm quite happy with my purchase for it provides a good set of exercises to practice grammar structures which are always complicated for esl studentsthank you"
1,Kicking myself,Ordered this on accident as it looks exactly like their au fraiche version except for color. I foolishly opened it because usually when a company designs a fragrance line there is a theme in the scents. These two are vastly different and should have been designed with different bottles. This one has a strong cardamom and baby powder stink. It punches you in the nose like Axe body sprays. And it lasts and lasts. I cleared the first two pumps in the bathroom sink and even after cleaning it I could still smell it. So at least it's a good value in that only one pump will work. This scent makes me think more Night At The Roxbury than a luxury brand such as Versace.
4,Striking Back: The Trigeminal Neuralgia Handbook (Unabridged,"Excellent book for someone who has never gone thru the pain of Trigeminal Neuralgia. However it should be read/studied along with someone who has had the experience of TN. There are comments in the book about trying different cures that could be very detrimental to a person looking for a long term cure. The best cure is the Microvascular Decompression (Janetta procedure). Any other suggested procedure (Gamma Knife, acupuncture, radio beams, injections, etc.) will cause the patient to be turned away by a neuro-surgeon because the surgeon will not operate on someone elses failures or mistakes. Read with care!!I am a twenty year survivor with a Microvascular Decompression procedure. If you wish to contact me for more information, I would be more than willing to take the time to listen and comment where I can.Jack Flannigan [...]"
4,"TN, an overview and a specific view","This book is excellent in its overview of TN and treatments, therapies and surgeries.My book, A Pained Life, is resourced in this book however the trigeminal neuralgia association has called it ""unapproved"". They have refused to state why specifically. Some have suggested it is because I suffered severe disfigurement from an MVD, a surgery that is nicknamed ""The Jannetta Procedure"" after the man who helped to perfect it and who is on the medical advisory board.[...]Both these books have been recommended for TN patients for their general information and for a personal look inside the life of a TN sufferer."
5,Help is available,"After a very long and harsh battle with TN, I have overcome the atypical category of face pain. This book must be available and should circulate. The information will help you find ways to combat this terrible disorder. If you are having problems contact the TN association at www.tna.org for more information. Even if you have to leave the State you live in-the adventures and research are worth it. Find, read, and pass this book around!!!!"
5,Latter Day Saints and Sinners,"After reading Brigham's Day, I am certain of two things. John Gates is a fine writer and a great story teller. The characters are well drawn, and Gates uses them to great effect in drawing the reader into the shadowed secrets of the Morman experience. I hope to meet Brigham Bybee again,and soon."
4,Another Holocaust,"The author takes us on an incredible journey with the slave Ama from her life in her own village, through several captivities and to her life in South America. What is fascinating to me about this novel is that it looks at the Middle Passage through the eyes of one woman. While Ama is a fictional character, and we don't know what happed specifically to an individual slave the book makes the reader think, really think about what could happen about the march to the sea, and the perilous middle passage. Worth reading!"
3,Ama God...this is a good read,"Ama is a book aimed at dispelling the racist myths that have infiltrated our Modern Society (the period from 1500 to present). It focuses on the humanity of the individual slave, rather than slavery as a whole.Slave life becomes more real to the audience, and beyond that, very emotionally gripping. See Ama get raped and all the ones she loves killed. Every aspect of her life is so transient and depressingly fleeting.I gave it a 3 because some of the writing is very silly and cliche, and a little longwinded, but it's definately a good read. It pegs right into the historical fiction category and contrary to the title, focuses a lot of energy and time in intra-African slave trading. This is an aspect many ignore when approaching the topic of slave trade from a US vantage.This book will sensitize people to the plights of long ago, that Herbstein suggests contine today, as he says the story does not end..."
4,Accurate account,"I read this book while I was travelling in Ghana. The terminology used by the author mirrored what I was hearing while I was there. While I did not visit Elmina, I went to the Cape Coast Castle and the information provided by the tour guide could have come straight from this book."
5,Knockout,"This recording is a true classic. I had (still have) the original vinyl (Grieg and Dvorak only) and I played all the grooves off it. I was delighted to get the CD, and to find that there had been added a wonderful rendition of the Tchaikovsky Serenade for Strings. These come from the days of the old UK Argo label, for which the Nev and the ASMF did such sterling work.Put simply, the music is great, the recording superb and chamber orchestra playing simply doesn't come any better than this. The ASMF was famous for the bounce and, for want of a better word, sparkle of its recordings and live performances. This one bounces and sparkles like no other. You simply HAVE to have this."
5,"Helps joints, mobility","I have been using Glucosamine and Chondroitin for years and this stuff really works! Much better than all the NSAIDS and over the counter medicines which do nothing to address the probem, just the symptoms. You do have to use it for a while, however, for it to really work."
3,I'm trying this product for 1 year.,"During my Dr. visit for shoulder joint pain and viewing the x-rays of how much cartilage I've lost in these joints, I decided to try and rebuild my cartilage with this product and MSM. Next years x-rays will either confirm or deny whether it actually works."
5,Bath Time Fun!,"My Four year old loves this dolly. It has a nice smell and dries quickly. My only complaint is underneath the cute clothes is a ""clothlike"" white fabric and attacted are the vinyl/plastic (whatever dolls are made of)skin colored arms and legs, why they didn't make the fabric part colored like a bathing suit is a mystery to me. It just looks alittle weird ""naked"". Bottom line is my daughter doesn't seem to care and loves it."
4,Ok doll,"not what i was expecting it seems there isnt enough plastic pellets to fill out the doll, so it doesnt sit up very well, but it is the perfect size and my daughter loves to bath with it, so it does serve it's purpose."
2,"great doll, but not for the bath!!","The inside of the doll's head was covered in mold within 3 months. We hung it to dry and drained the head everytime it was in the bath as instructed, but it did not matter. I wrote the company and they did send us a replacement doll (not the exact one we had), but I will not put this one in the bath. My toddler loves this doll, but I would recommend choosing a different one not meant for the bath."
3,Tub Splash Guard,"It worked to stop the leaking from the shower. The fit is not real good, had to use silicon to get it to fit to the wall."
5,Hot Vintage Hentai,"If you're looking for a hentai DVD with a lot of nudity, sex, bondage and rape. This movie is for you.This was the first anime-hentai I've seen several years ago. It's as hot now as it was then. Six beautiful girls on a sea voyage gets apprehended by pirates. The pirates take charge and dock the boat on a deserted island. The girls manage to escape, but the pirates capture the girls one at a time and have their way with them by means of bondage, rape and torture. In the end, the girls get their revenge.This movie is definitely not for children."
3,Greatest Hits?,"For most MxPx fans out there this was nothing new, except for the 3 (yes count them 3, My Mistake, Running away, The Broken Bones) new songs on there. I was upset we didnt see Responsibility, Lifetime Enlightenment, and some of their other ""hits"". I am little sick of hearing Punk Rock Show on like all their albums. This is a good song but it gets old after a while. I am hoping for maybe a fan based greatest hits collection for their next one if they do another one. I would only recommend this for people who are just starting to listen to MxPx, if you own some of the big ones like Ever Passing Moment, Life in General and Let it Happen, you arent missing much."
4,Best of that's not Best of,"Ten years of music and you get 19 songs for a greatest hits? I liked the new Punk Rawk Show. It's a decent song list, with their most popular Chick Magnet and just awesome Want Ad, but a fan like me could ask ""Where's 'I'm Ok, You're Ok"" or 'Cristalena', or 'Southbound', or 'The Next Big Thing' or even their single from EPM 'Responsibility'""? If you're looking for greatest hits, this is for you. If you're looking for BEST OF, this isn't what you're looking for. I took a poll around my area and the majority of people said that there should be at least 22 songs for 10 years worth. This doesn't beat Life in General or Slowly Going... but it's worth a buy."
5,The best of album ALMOST perfectly done!!!!!,"This album is awesome as anything by mxpx is. The new songs 'My Mistake' and 'Running Away' are really awesome and are now 2 of my many favorites by them. The re-recording of 'Punk Rawk Show' is just stellar. It blows the original away! The remixed versions of 'Tommorows Another Day', and 'Let It Happen' are very awesome. Although it isn't a new song 'Broken Bones' is new to me and let me tell you, it's a very catchy sing along song. The only thing I can say I was disappointed in was the fact that they didn't put in certain songs I was hoping for like 'Under Lock and Key', 'I'm OK You're OK', and 'Party at my house'. Those 3 are favorites and are classics of the 'buffalo' and should have been on this album. That's the only complaint I have. If you like mxpx and want to hear their best stuff including the most recent material go and grab this one folks!!"
3,"Great Band, Mediocre CD","To be frank, MxPx took songs that were already great, and instead of just re-recording them, made them sound poppy and contrived. If you're looking to be bored, get this CD. If you want to listen to good MxPx music, listen to ""Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo""."
5,THE BEST!!!,"This is MxPx's best Cd ever! You have to buy this Cd, it is worth it! Any REAL punk will buy this CD. This is a great CD were every track rocks! You have to get this CD, you'll get hooked to it. You'll listen to it alot more than you listen to Life in General or Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo! Buy this now, it's Awesome!!!"
3,skip most songs,"this cd is okay.but it sounds too poppy like blink 182.if you want a more heavier christian punk check out mxpx's pokinatcha. it is much more hardcore.but if you like poppy punk then this is for you.the good ones are punk rawk show, lifestory, pokinatcha punx(pxpx), gsf, and middlename the rest are not too good. either try pokinatcha or let it happen from mxpx. the rest are not worth it."
2,Choose Lonely Planet,"While Fodor's name is a truly reputable one, I would not suggest that this guide book be your only source of information. I went with a friend of the summer and found it to be a wonderful time to go. The book suggests not to go during the so called ""rainy season,"" but it was beautiful then. We never missed a day do to rain. The book also tells its reader that the country is easy to travel by bus---rent a car if you have less than 2 weeks. There is too much to see. If you are looking for the most accurate and up to date information on Costa Rica choose Lonely Plant."
2,Date sugar,I just didn't use up this product. The sugar came as a solid hunk and I had to grate it in order to use it. Made a sticky mess all over my kitchen counter. Came four packs to the package and I still have three.
1,Beware!!!,"This is weak. Do we need a bad cover of ""Get Together""? The liner notes state that this is better than Grand Funk. Sorry!There should also be no mention of Uriah Heep concerning this cd. They are nothing like that band. I'm listening to Lucifer right now and I'm ready to go to sleep."
4,movie,very good movie - good quality of actors - good script - I really loved it and will recommend it
2,Dull and Disappointing,"One type of movie I strongly dislike is one where the characters in the story are missing. All I can see in this type of movie are actors working in front of a camera to a script. I did not buy any of the actors in Polisse as cops. They are merely nice looking people doing an acting gig.I felt no engagement with the cop-characters, and, generally, felt manipulated by the stories, with the exception of the young rape victim giving birth. That was quite moving.I have no idea about the motivation for the action of the final scene. My only thought while watching it was ""good rittance.""A more interesting movie would examine why each of these cops has chosen to work in this particular branch of police work."
2,Vapid,"""Cute"" is a generous descriptor for shallow ""Filthy Rich."" I liken it to a a funny Saturday Night Live sketch that's stretched into a painful feature-length film. Instead, pick up Bridget Jones' Diary or Getting Over It by Anna Maxted."
1,Filthy Rich,"The other reviews on this book were funnier than the book. ""Cripplingly Funny"", ""better than Bridget Jones Diary"" -- what is happening to people's sharp wit? An ""easy reader"" by a woman with no real sense of humor. No imagination was put into this book at all. This book is a total waste of money."
2,elementary school reading,I thought this book looked fun but I was really let down. It feels like people magazine or a book you'd read for elementary school. I know it sounds harsh but I couldn't even make myself finish this book. Read something else.
1,Unoriginal and boring,"If you have ever watched ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" (and who hasn't?), there is nothing original about this book. The author's characters are predictable and boring. The game show host in this book is a carbon copy of Regis, down to his wardrobe and morning TV show gig. Even the game show setting is exactly the same. Though you like the main character at first, she quickly becomes boring and tiresome, and the new ""mystery"" man is far fetched and contrived. It's sad, because the story could have been fun if only it had a little more depth and originality. Unless you're related to the author and are trying to help her income, I wouldn't bother with this one."
4,Amusing Story,"Filthy Rich is an amusing story--one that is perhaps getting a bit dated already because of the vagaries of network television. Our heroine and narrator, Marcie Lee Mallowitz is dumped on live, national television by her fiance after she gives him the incorrect answer in a Who Wants To Be Millionaire-type game show. The dumping is so spectacular that it catches the national imagination--Marcie becomes an instant celebrity a la Darva Conger and others like her. People Magazine and their ilk come running, pursuing her at every turn. This is an amusing novel and because of it's unique story line (as compared to your standard romantic comedy), it is not absolutely predictable. A fun little read--perfect for a two hour plane ride."
3,"Hilarious, fun read","What a fun read. No, it's not deep and literary, but that's not what I wanted to read.""Filthy Rich"" is a great escape read. We've all thought about what it would be like to have our 15 minutes of fame. Lots of us have wondered what it would be like to be sought after by the media. In ""Filthy Rich,"" we go along for the ride with the heroine as it happens to her. And it's a hoot!"
3,cute,"I found this book to be *cute*.The entire book occurs over like 1 week...I found the similarities between the TV show in the book, ""Filty Rich"" and ""Who wants to be a Millionaire"" very, very similiar...especially the ""Regis"" character.Still - it was a cute read. A couple of LOL moments."
1,Didn't do it for me,"Maybe the story was too contrived, but I found myself skipping big chunks of it and not missing anything. I thought the premise was wonderful, but the delivery fell way short of being entertaining. I would never recommend this to anyone."
1,TRITE,"This book lacks ANY clever jokes or storyline. I agree with the ""elementary school reading"" comment. I bought this because of the Bridget Jones reference-well Helen Fiedling should be offended if anyone uses her name in reviewing this book. The jokes are very lame-and immature. I couldn't even finish it.don't waste your money."
5,A funny and topical saga of our celebrity-obsessed culture,"I confess I was skeptical when I picked up this debut novel by New York Times Editorial Board member Dorothy Samuels at the urging of my girlfriend, who found it amazingly funny. But now that I've finished reading and laughing through Filthy Rich, my one complaint is it wasn't longer. I wanted to prolong the fun.Moreover, this entertaining book cannot be dismissed as just another guilty pleasure or example of shallow chicks-lit. The dead-on depiction of America's nutty celebrity fixation and increasingly crass TV culture makes Filthy Rich light-hearted social commentary that should appeal to anyone who pays attention to the news and social trends, and has a good sense of humor.I have to hand it to my girlfriend: She has very good taste."
3,French verbs up your sleeve!,"For a study aid this is adequate, and it does not claim to be more than a study aid anyway. So, not actually to learn the verbs, but to refresh your memory, that's what it may be suitable for. Now, who will need it? As a teacher, it is not what I would recommend, but my pupils may like it. There will be times when they may feel it is useful, hidden in their pocket or up their sleeve!"
1,Why do people love this book??,"I don't get it. My three-and-a-half-year-old son doesn't like it. It lacks the sweetness and focus of ""Corduroy"" or ""The Snowy Day."" It changes scene too often (and not in a good way, like Harold and the Purple Crayon). And the characters are unkind to each other until the very end. I bought this book based on good reviews, but without having read it myself. My mistake. I think this is not a great book for little kids to read, and I won't read it again with my son. Very disappointing."
4,An interesting preschool read,"I ordered several books on CD for my 4 year old grandson to listen to in the car. He seems to like ""Lyle, Lyle Crocodile"" and sometimes requests it. From my perspective, though, it is not nearly as engaging as some other books on tape. The story is read by the author, who is not an actor, and the reading is rather dry."
5,Wonderful book!,I received this book when I was a little girl...way back when it was written. My original copy is much loved and I wanted to continue to be able to share it with my children and grandchildren. I am so glad it is still in print. Wonderful story - wonderful message.
2,"Book good, CD terrible",We love the Eric Carle series and use his CDs often; unfortunately this book is nowhere near as entertaining. Very monotone reading.
5,He's adorable!,How can you not like Lyle? My granddaughter has several of the Lyle books and thinks this one is great!
2,Cheap hooks break with seller ignoring messages,"We bought this and like the dolphin art. Typical oak finish, give it an 7 out of 10 for the finish.When putting this up a coat hook broke off. They are made of the cheapest die cast metal.So we do not even have it on the wall and it is broken.The seller was basically unresponsive to our request for a replacement hook and has ignoredour messages.Now we have to go to the hardware store and find a set of hooks that will fit the mirror.We cannot recommend this product or the seller. Buy at your own risk."
3,Review of Sony ICD-MX20VTP,"I bought this device to record daily notes which it does very well. No problems with recording quality and the supplied Sony Digital Editor Software works fine. Problems I ran into initally was getting used to manipulating the small buttons,they're just too small. It says you can hit the stop button and if you don't change folders, resume in the same message. This is not true, and you must hit pause to continue. The provided Dragon software is not current as Version 9 is out. Transcription from a microphone is very good after training, from the recorder its awful. Overall I am pleased with this product. I recommend a memory stick upgrade and upgrading to Dragon version 9. By the way if you have problems using Dragon, Sony will tell you to call Nuance, and Nuance will tell you to call Sony. Once you put your mind to it you can figure it out without them."
4,Pretty easy to use just wish it had an off switch,I got this product for my mom to use in her private counseling practice to make CD's for her clients. Figuring out how to convert the file to a format that will play on a CD took a little while but once you figure out that it needs to be a .wav file it's very easy to actually convert the file and burn it to a CD. The button to navigate the menu is kind of small and not necessarily intuitive. Overall however the product has good sound and recording quality is generally easy to use and I am confident that my mom will be able to use it with ease.
5,Voice recorder - top of the line!,"The Sony ICD-MX20VTP Digital Voice Recorder has been great. It's easy to set up the computer, and transfer my work notes to print. Great investment!!"
5,Great whisk,Well designed whisk that works nicely and has had no problems going through the dishwasher.
4,strudy but heavy,"I feel like this is a heavy duty whisk. I'm not quite used to the weight of it yet, espeically when making custards, my hand gets super tired."
3,Just too small,"While the pictures are wonderful, for an aging dinosaur like myself they are just too small. It is very hard to see the pictures!Would have given it 10 stars if it was just a larger book. Some of the flowers are only one inch high, much too small for me to appreciate the detail.Where can we find this in an 8.5 x 11 version?"
5,O'Keeffe has a unique way of capturing the beauty of flowers,O'Keeffe can magnify the beauty of flowers magically in her paintings. Her perception allows the everyday art lover to escape into God's garden and visualize the serenity found in heaven.
2,Too Small,Book is way too small to truly appreciate the beauty of O'Keefe's pictures. I was disappointed but will use it as a handy guide to find larger works.
4,One Hundred Flowers,Love this book -Georgia O 'Keefe is always an inspiration. Unfortunately the cover was torn on arrival and after waiting a month for the shipment it was not worth the hassle to return. Instead of giving this book for a gift I kept for myself. I guess that is the good part . Jo in CO
5,Georgia O'Keeffe:100 Flowers,"The book was in great condition. No tearing, no writing on pages. Plastic on outside of cover. Very well maintained. Very happy with product. Will do business with this supplier again. Thank You very much."
1,No satisfaction,"I purchased this book to replace a copy that was stolen from the local library using my daughter's stolen library card. The price was $75, so I assumed it was a hardback, which is what the library wanted. When it came, it was a paperback with the original price marked on the back cover:$8.95. The library would not accept it and I had to pay them the replacement cost they listed: $105. I contacted the seller and he indicated that he would accept a return but not for the full price. I emailed him to ask how much he would refund and I have not heard from him since. It has been more than three months, and I am out $180. Nothing in the seller's info indicated that this was a paperback or that no refund would be given."
1,Not Received Yet,I have not received this book yet. I don't know why......Why did I have to rate this item with one star in order to send this review. That star in #2 is invalid.
2,Fast Speeds and Tight Ensemble Are Suffocated by Awful Recording Quality. Blame The Engineers!,"This is one of the better performances in the Abbado-Berlin Philharmonic run through of Beethoven Symphonies. I'm talking about the 7th symphony, the 8th is pretty lousy.You get clear playing, fast speeds, even some thrilling timpani here and there but everything is for nothing because this whole cycle suffers from a very low level recording quality, it is far too distant to make much of an impact. If you know the 7th symphony, you know it can make quite an impact. The finale under Abbado is taken extremely fast, even faster than Karajan and Karajan was the fastest around! Because of Abbado's manic speed, the rhythmic articulation suffers and it feels like it's smoothed over and feels like soup, instead of fire and lighting. There needs to be more contrast! You would be better off looking somewhere else for a great 7th, you would be even better off just passing on this Abbado cycle altogether."
3,A little disappointed,My family pioneered the Western Kentucky area. If I had known that none of my families were mentioned I would not have purchased it. I felt it was limited to a specific group of people. The title is misleading. The book itself was very well done. And it looks good on my library shelf. Just can't tell a book by it's cover.
4,Good Source of Genealogy Info,"The ""Kentucky Pioneers and Their Ancestors"" book is an excellent resource for tracking down some family connections in Kentucky. The migration through Kentucky was constantly changing the makeup of the population which makes tracing some families difficult.This book is very helpful in my genealogy research."
1,Overpriced JUNK,"It is NOT a smoker, it is simply an overpriced charcoal grill for making steaks and hamburgers. There is no way to control the air effectively, so in the end, you have an uncontrollable fire, and the grill has VERY limited uses. The only fire control you have is the ability to raise or lower the fire. Too bad you cannot control the temperature/air which is critical for smoking. For the price, you would be much better off with so many other grills. Forget low and slow with this grill. not possible."
3,Too much money for too little content,"A great deal of this dvd deals in choosing a driving horse and the different disciplines of miniature horse driving. While interesting enough, I purchased this to learn how to train my mini to drive and so it was not that helpful. It has some good information and does show how to harness your horse, but not much to get you started training. I was disappointed, since I felt for the large price tag, I should have received much more content and length of video. The content is only about 20 minutes. This is first in a series and gives you very little information on how to acutally train your horse. You will need to purchase the next dvds in the series, which at $40 a pop, is way too expensive in relation to product received, in my opinion, and I will not be purchasing them. If you are planning on competing with your miniature horse and money is not a problem, then this series would be a good product to buy."
3,could be even better,"This book has great examples, is clear and well organized. The thing that I find falls short with books relating to VBA libraries, is that there isn't a nice little short reference containing the relevant classes, objects, syntax, and examples to call the library functions and methods. If the authors were to include this very helpful aid, I'd rate this book a 5 in a heartbeat."
1,What a Waste!,"This is one of the worst computer software instruction books that I have ever attempted to read. For starters, the writing (and over all book lay out) is unclear and unnecessarily complicated -- and not reader friendly. After each chapter, I just got more and more confused and bewildered. The lay out of the pages and chapters, for example, are not designed with clarity and reader ease in mind. There is just way too much text crammed onto every page. In short, I bought this book to help me understand more about Visual Basics and Excel and, in both cases, the book failed me and instead just deliverd a lot of frustration and wasted time."
2,Just for Beginner,"A very good book for beginner. Just for beginner!!If you are not beginner, don't waste your money.If you are not office clerk, I don't suggest it."
2,Unfortunate Quality,"The board arrived on time and in good condition. The board it self is of terrible quality. It is warped be 4mm+ and half of the Copper-clad laminates were off by 1mm-2mm. I have given this two stars because it is functional, but terrible quality."
4,A nice reminder of the Fine Young Cannibals,"Overall I am enjoying the CD. Nothing outstanding that I want to listen to over and over again, but I always enjoyed listening to Roland Gift's unique voice from the FYC and this is letting me enjoy it again. On the other hand, nothing particularly bad, just mostly vanilla."
4,Europe's Gift,Too bad Gift disappeared so completely from the scene in the United States. This is a very good album with Gift's characteristic voice carrying a lot of feeling for the material. Very enjoyable.
4,Raquella,I learned so much about the many wars that the Jewish people endured before and after they beame a state. A very interesting true story about a nurse serving during those times.
4,Raquela,"Provides an on the ground, everyday account of the founding and growth of Israel into a nation by someone who lived it."
5,Raquella by Ruth Gruber- a special book,Raquela by Ruth Gruber is the best ruth gruber i've read. a must read for any womananother mother of Israel
3,Raquela,"Good story. Good history lesson. Lacked a real story teller to really hook a reader. Should be read after ""terror out of Zion""."
5,Such a great book!,I absolutely love reading biographies of real people. The story of Raquela's life was an inspiration! It also helped fill in the gaps concerning the history of Israel becoming a nation. I WILL definitely read this book more than once!
5,A wonderful read.,"A beautifully written historical and biographical story.The book is a history of the fight for the State of Israel and one woman's story in that fight and in the founding days of Hadassah, the Womens Zionist Organization.Ruth Gruber knows how to get the reader engaged with facts that keep you wanting more."
5,Raquela: A Woman of Israel,Raquela: A Woman of Israel is the best book I read this year. It's a book of the history of how Israel became a state. The struggle of the Jews during and after World War II. Also the determination of Raquela to serve her country as a nurse and to help women to deliver babies as a mid-wife.I couldn't put this book down. It was fantastic.
5,Loved it!,Great story that brings history to life. Learned a lot about Israel becoming a nation under seemingly unsurmountable circumstances. The personal aspect draws you in immediately.
5,raquela,this book had me hooked from page one.. I couldn't put it down and there were parts of the book that had me in tears along with the characters involved with the story.This was some spectacular woman.
3,1/2 way there,"the travel charger stopped working after about 3 days but the rest works great, and teh car charger is fine so far, and the phone holder is awesome"
5,Wonderful!,"This Travis Tritt CD has GREAT songs on it, and the singing is just fabulous. This CD is definitely worth purchasing, just like all of Travis Tritt's CD's. What a talent!!!!"
1,"Unless you have wiring skills, pass on this item.","12V Magnetic Trailer Light KitI have to agree with everything Reg Great Lakes said. I ignored his advice, and bought a product that, as factory wired, will not work on any car or truck known to man. The wiring is just plain idiotic. If you understand trailer wiring, they can be rewired to work correctly in about 5 minutes. If you don't, don't buy this product. It took two of us, neither of whom are great electricians, about 4 hours to figure out the correct wiring and to get them working. Since these inexpensive magnetic lights are sold by dozens of companies, It would be my guess that they all come from the same factory in China and are all wired incorrectly. If you aren't mechanically and electrically inclined, buy some other type of portable trailer lights."
3,worst menu system ever,"As another reviewer said, this has a truly horrible menu system. You need to wait through long introductions. You can't just move the pointer in some of the menus--you need to wait for the annoying smitten to move to the option you want, and then press select before he moves to the next one. Moreover, I have never figured out how to play the other movie after playing one. I can go back to the menu, but not the disk menu, only the menu for that movie. The only way to play the other movie that I have found is turn off the DVD player and turn it back on (more time wasted).The content is fine and the mastering is good."
1,glorified fan,"Unless the coolest you will ever want the room is 61 degrees, do not buy this product. Its internal thermostat has a low setting of only 61, and that is not the kind of ""cold"" many seek when buying a unit. Sure, 61 beats 95 on a hot July day, but I think we all want the option of making a room truly cool, like while we sleep. Most nights one is better off with a window fan rather that this piece of expensive crap."
1,It worked for a bit...,It legitimately worked for 3 months and again after winter for 2 more months. It now works only as a fan. It no longer cools anything and essentially blows in the hot air from the outside. I would not recommend this product mostly because it really couldn't cool cool a small family room below 71 degrees. Just too pricey (even when It doesn't break...).DO NOT BUY!
5,A Customer,"Everyone who works with or has ever come in contact with a child molester(s) could benefit from reading this book. Take it from an adult survivor who has gone through and come out the other side -- what Leberg says about the molester is true! They are very skilled at what they do - they are wired differently - children are their 'drug' of choice, and they will do anything in their power to get and keep what they want and need."
3,Interesting but a bit dumb,"I picked up this book durring a recent trip to San Semion thinking it would be fun to hear all the wild and crazy things that happened in the castle. Well I got that partly, but I enjoyed it more for it's portrayal of early Hollywood. Hearing stories like Davies and Clarke Gable ditching the debut of Gone With The Wind (it was too long) to make prank calls are too good to pass up.On the surface, Davies seems to have a terrific life of parties, fashion, socialites and more than enough money to spare. But then you realize that she didn't particularly like making movies, hobknobbing with world leaders or going places that Mr. Hearst did. She was just a slightly ditzy girl wanting to romp and have a good time. I felt sorry for most of the time and it got a bit depressing. But it's her free spirited nature that makes to book as enjoyable as it is. Although,I must admit to putting it down to read something a bit more substantial a few times."
4,An interesting read regardless of the what really happened.,"This is the sort of autobiography that you have to take at face value, not as a faithful and reliable historical document. A woman like Marion Davies with a life like hers comes along a handful of times each century. So, however she tells her story, however faithful she is or isn't to the truth of what happened during her extraordinary life is largely beside the point. What you will learn in this book is her version of the times she had and that, in itself, makes this book a worthwhile read. Will you learn the absolute truth? No. Will you gain an insight to what it was like to share your life with the most powerful man of his generation? Yes."
5,the underdog,although not all of her films were master pieces films likeshowpeoplenot so dumbthe patsyoperator 13going hollywoodpage miss gloryand little old new york are must sees :)since she is the one tellingthe story its very interesting to see point of view of the things that where going on around her at the time.her and hearst had a wonderful life just reading about her parties makes you want to jump back in time and join in :)
2,Time could have been better spent,"A flimsy, repetitive and disjointed book that manages to mildly entertain at first, before the ennui sets in. It's a series of vignettes rather than a narrative, and whilst I don't think Marion herself would have made any grand claims for it, the editors (whose presence is constantly felt) seem to be trying to elevate Marion Davies to a level of literary and historical importance that just isn't justified."
1,Extremely boring!,I REITERATE---EXTREMELY BORING BOOK. I GAVE UP READING IT AFTER 30 PAGES. IT IS DRIVEL!
2,What a waste,"This book was worthwhile only in the sense that it provided an opportunity to learn just how shallow and spoiled Marion Davies was. Her life apparently consisted of endless parties, trips to Europe (with her complaining all the while), and playing viscious pranks on her so called friends. Her fascination with Hitler, hatred of Irish and Southernors didn't help.This book was pretty depressing, but it did make me realize how lucky I am to not have anything to do with people like that!"
1,Seriously disappointed and mad,"I bought these for my new truck. What a joke, I only got one. Appearantly they are not sold in pairs! Who the heck buy's one back floor matt? What a rip off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,A trend trading program for commodity spreads,"This is basically a Donchian type trend trading program applied to commodity spreads. Trading this system with a portfolio of diversified commodity spreads will make profits, but with frequent whipsaw trading while waiting for the eventual profitable trend.Information on seasonal spreads, how to select spreads and money management is skimpy or lacking.Beginners will need more information than is provided in this book, and advanced spread traders probably don't need this system."
2,SURBURAN MADNESS,This film was ok but not what I thought it would be. At least I know that now by having watched it.
1,Worst TV movie ever,"This has to be one of the worst made-for-TV movies I've ever seen. The acting is fierce bad, the story is confusing and hardly tells the REAL story involved -- that of a woman so infuriated by jealousy that she runs down her cheating hubby in the car park of a hotel, caught on video by the PI that she hired to trail him. I remember when this all happened, and I couldn't believe what a poor job this movie did of re-telling it. It's more about the PI and her problems it seems. Buyers beware. Download it from the internet and watch it before paying good money for it. It's total RUBBISH."
4,"Great sound, not too many accessories","This keyboard is a fantastic keyboard if you're going to quality sound. I use it for composing music and have it hooked up to my computer. The speaker system is fantastic, but it doesn't come with a stand, doesn't have reverberation settings, and doesn't have a diskette drive (although it does have the location for one). The keys are a bit tight, but most of the instrument sounds are realistic. It also does not include a stand or sustain pedal. If you're looking for something for composition purposes, this is a great deal. If you're looking for something to have around to learn to play the keyboard, look for something a bit cheaper and possibly even smaller. This doesn't transport easily."
3,Nothing special,"I must say that these performances were something of a disappointment for me.A bit underplayed,i think.There is,to put it simply,not enough energy and vitality in them.I suppose that health problems of Maestro Abbado at that particular moment have something to do with this.Anyway,these versions are certainly not a substitute for a war-time recordings of great Wilhelm Furtwangler."
3,Episodes aren't as good as earlier DVDs,"My son (and myself) both love the George series on PBS and the DVDs, but it really seems like the episodes are getting less enjoyable in the more recent releases.I think the earlier ones were much better (and cheaper since they're out longer). I only really liked one episode on this one (the Igloo building one) and didn't care for any of the others. Maybee kids still like them all, but for the parents who sit through them or just like watching them on their own occasionaly, I think the older ones are best. And only get this if your a completionist and need to have every release."
2,"I've read good vamp books & I can only say ""huh"" about this","I tried really hard to get into this book, and I am an avid reader of several different genres. Typically when I read a book I like, I pick up everything I can find from the author...after reading this my first thought was...ok - well thank goodness that's over...I can honestly say that I have absolutely no intention of buying any more of Strieber's books."
2,why can't some things stay gold?,"I loved the Hunger, frankly I thought it was one of the most innovative and fleshed out vamp books to come out in the last thirty years (and believe me I know-I've read nearly everything on the subject) and I have to say this was a horrible and completely unnecessary book. The Last Vampire was bad enough, but this? Strieber's writing and attention to detail and plausibility have taken a steady decline. While Miriam was introduced as lonely and alien, and I will say this for the record, one of the only thoroughly believable ancient characters in vampire literature, she had become more and more ineffectual and trite as the ""series"" has progressed. I really thought the first book stood perfectly well on its own, the vampiric society left a lot to the imagination. Sigh. It's readable and you may even like it, but if it was up to me I'd say read the first and pretend like there weren't even two more."
3,"Not consistent with the first book, but not all together bad.","I do not understand how an author can seem to write a sequel and not consult the story line that was written in the first. Pretty inconsistent that her father was able to come back from his death in the first book to die again in the sequel. My recommendation would be to read this as if you had never read The Hunger, it will make it a lot more palatable."
4,still some life left in vampire saga,"I enjoyed this novel a lot more than other vampire novels, chiefly because Strieber is such a good writer. This novel may not be terribly original, but it has some of the most vivid writing I have ever read, especially in the descriptions of Lilith's attempts to deal with the modern world; not only that, it doesn;t rely on gore to deliver the thrills, though it does have its horrific moments. On the minus side, it is, like I've said, not terribly original, there is some pointless name-dropping, and there is a glaring mistake in chapter 10 in which a woman throws her empty gun away, but then still has it two pages later. An A for effort, but a B (at best) for results."
3,mediocre engineering,"I have since ""Mrs. Brown"", ""Leaning on a Lamp"", and ""Henry the VIIIth"" been a huge fan of Peter Noone and Herman's Hermits. I remember going to a movie which was mostly a loosely connected string of their songs featuring ""She's a Must to Avoid"". The recording quality of this is quite poor, and I know they have been recorded very well on other discs. Can't wholehardedly recommend."
1,An Artist Fanaticizes over Tibetan Art,"Although containing some excellent detail reproductions of Tibetan paintings, Fischle simply is being enthusiastic and lacks fundamental knowledge of the subject matter that he pretends to explain."
5,This Stuff Is Fantastic!,Since recieving this (and also theTick TwisterI have removed two dog ticks. The liquid smells like very strong citronella. It must stun the ticks; neither backed out on their own but were easily twisted out intact using the Twister. I highly recommend!
4,Good product for the price,This is a good item for the price. It holds 8 bottles of wine and has a small footprint (although it is deeper than I expected). The fridge keeps ithe set temperature fairly well. I have noticed some fluctuation when putting new bottles in that are room temp. It stabilizes though once it brings everything down to temperature.I would advise potential buyers to ensure there is enough clearance between the back and a wall so the fan can get proper ventilation. Also remember to clean the filter periodically.
1,Do not was your money,"To keep short and simple: I bought this wine cooler on May 10th; it stop working on the 2nd of July.The cooler is so cheap (just see how much it cost here on Amazon) that it is not even worth complaining. If you want to save your money and time, do **not** buy this cooler."
2,Not much for your money,I didn't look that carefully at the CD. My fault but it only has 4 tracks on the CD. I thought it was a regular CD. For the money - it's not a great deal.
2,just okay,"This book is a mediocre recipe book for bread. They show pictures of breads that were obviously done on the dough cycle and baked in the oven, but they don't give instructions on how to bake your breads in the oven. There are also a lot of hard to find ingredients in the recipes. I searched every health food store in town looking for the ingredients to one of the recipes, without success.I found more useful recipes on the Fleischmann yeast website than I did in this book."
1,No thank you!,"The recipes that I tried never worked out. The ratios were way off, sometimes leaving a watery mess. The altitude was not a factor, as I have needed no adjustments at 5200 feet."
2,Big Disappointment,"I bought this book thinking that the bread recipes looked interesting and delicious. Well, they're interesting alright. Interesting messes!! Did this author actually test ANY of these recipes? The liquid to dry proportionas are all off. Don't waste any time or expense on this book."
2,logo caps do not stay on,"These license plate frames are attractive, but unusable. The snap on logo caps do not stay on. Also the frame is too wide on the bottom and covers up the stickers on license plates."
4,another great ingmar Bergman film.,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.""Smiles of a Summer Night"" known in Sweden as ""Sommarnattens leende"" is one of Bergman's early films and one of the more well known ones.The film takes place in Sweden around the turn of the century, and is about 8 people and their aristocratic life.The film was of Bergman's first films to be internationally recognized and remains popular to this day. I particularly enjoyed several scenes and enjoyed the scenery around the end of the film.The DVD has some fine special features also.There is the original theatrical trailer, an introduction to the film presented by Ingmar Bergman at a miniture theater he owns on the Swedish island of Frö, and a conversation between Peter Cowie and Jörn Donner.This film is a must for Bergman fans."
3,Wickedly Clever,"skewering of rich Europeans in the late 1800's. Most have and/or will cheat on their spouses. For these rich, adultery seemed such a common occurence that elaborate schemes had to be invented just to keep them from being bored. Apparently the first world war later jarred many aristocrats out of this openly contemptuous, miserable, and decadent lifestyle."
4,A very good comedy,"This movie reminded me of a Shakespeare comedy in the insightand complexity of the motivations. We have the lawyerwho robs the cradle,his son, the actress and count and countesswith the servants as comedy relief showing wisecomments.As a period play of a time that bridges ancientand modern Sweden, this play shows a wonderfulinsight into the love and sexual lives of the upper class.I really liked this."
3,Say what?,"The English subtitles do not work, despite repeated efforts. It is a good thing the Blue Ray came with a booklet explaining the plot."
1,Smiles of a Summer Night,"This is a silly comedy. It is more suited for a Broadway show and was, by Bergman's own admission, the result of the pressure from the businessmen at Svensk Filmindustri. Absolute waste."
2,Only presents one opinion,"I am a Yemeni Jew who was born and raised in the U.S. After my granparents left Yemen for Israel, they realized that they had made a huge mistake. In Israel, they were subjected to even more racism and bigotry than they had been in Yemen. Babies born to Yemeni Jews in Israel were sold to adoption agencies abroad. This book, although well writen, gives the reader the wrong idea. That is that Yemen was a terrible place for Jews, and that Israel was an escape from bigotry and racism. I would not recommend this book."
5,Mystical...Peaceful...Divine!,"This is a must have cd for any Snatam Kaur admirer, or for anyone who loves beautiful spiritual music. Excellent sound quality, beautiful exotic indian instruments and mystical atsmosphere, and angelic vocals from the kundalini goddess, Snatam Kaur.Snatam Kaur is one of the greatest and most inspirational singers on the planet. I would like to see her divine music break into the mainstream one day, so that her music will enlighten and bring joy to so many questioning and yearning souls, and open their hearts to universal love and peace.Namaste!"
3,if only,"I adore Snatam Kaurs music. She has a voice that transcends and heals. I was very disappointed in this particular piece because she added a male background singer, whose voice is like an off key synthesizer. Every time he starts singing, it throws off the entire sound, and I have ended up just saving the couple tracks that he doesn't sing on.I would be so happy if she doesn't do this again"
3,"Not the best, but has interesting moments...","Mainly seems to be setting things up for the finale. Had some moments I found intriguing, and some interesting perspective on Buffy/Angel during the time of Buffy/Riley, but its nowhere near up to the level of the Christopher Golden/Nancy Holder collaborations."
2,"Love Buffy, but...","I LOVE Buffy The Vampire Slayer, and Angel...but these books were SO boring to me. I could hardly get through them."
3,Ok...but..,"the next book, the Long Way Home was better. I didn't buy The Burning, but I don't think I missed much. This book just wasn't very interesting to me. The Long Way Home wasn't even that great, but it was better than this book. It's missing something that I can't quite put my finger on."
2,Complete waste of money!!!!!!!,"The only reason im giving this book 2 stars is because of buffy good looks and willow""s magic powers but apart from that this story is bull theres too much talking and stuff going on and theres practicaly no action i thought buffy slayed demons but this is in about 5 places at once and its really confusing safe your money and get the best buffy book Tales Of The Slayer"
4,The Whole Truth,"It takes a keen and courageous observer to lay bare the hypocracy of the sole world superpower, and to do so with enough irony and humor to keep a twinkle in a reader's eye. Ben Nicholson is such a writer, and this book gives hope that not everyone is being made subservient to a conservative agenda. In fact, the importance of this book is that it really takes no specific political stance, because really it is outlining a broad critique of quite fundamental American stupidities - not reserved to either Republicans or Democrats.This book is important because its extreme suppositions and speculations are only implausible within a momentary context - America shows again and again it's ability to go beyond, (for good and for evil), everything we can imagine at this present moment.But mostly, this is just a good read, building momentum and constructing linkages and scenarios that would make Raymond Roussel proud - had he ever written a political novel."
1,Ben Nicholson Who Needs Him?,"This incredibly interesting man, who owns the single largest collection of bread clips in the world, was my professor. Please I hope you recognized my sarcasm for such outrageous excuse for an educator. I remember Nicholson's lecture on Ash Wednesday of 2003, where he showed an image of a sculptor creating a statue of Jesus and happened to be ""working on"" our Lord's genitals. If you want to read a book by this atheistic ignoramus, then be my guest. As for me, I would sleep better if he was fired from his over-paying job at The Illinois Institute of Technology, knowing he no longer has the power to warp the minds of young architects. And Benny, if you hate this country so much, then take your cardigans and stained teeth back to Britain."
3,A book of mixed quality,"The author is not a very gripping writer of history, but when writing about his own experiences and his neighborhood in the present, he does a great job. It is a big task for someone who's not a professional historian to really work himself into different areas of European history, and Karmel is not equal to the task, falling back on numerous generalizations, particularly about the older periods he discusses. Read his description of the neighborhood in the modern period and skip the rest."
2,Language Barriers...aarrgh,Just got this book actually and has never spoken a lick of french. I bought it because I plan on doing an over nighter in Paris and figured it would be great to know at least a few basic words....but guess what I don't think I am getting it...LOL Otherwise it is a great reference guide. Small enough to carry around and not that bulky.
5,"By the end of it, you're in Heaven!","In a nutshell, this recording demonstrates the greatness of Grabiel Faure. It also happens to demonstrate the sensetive genious of Herreweghe. The sound is beautiful. The choruses are beautiful. The pace is perfect. By the time you hear the 7th track you'll really be in Paradisium!"
3,"Does the job, but could be better",I remember a toy like this from my childhood. That toy was better (and nowhere to be found). The animals are rather poorly designed (my kids with developmental disabilities can't always tell what they are supposed to be). And the Old Lady's shoes keep falling off. I love it because it's a great music-based activity - good for social and language development; it provides some motivation to stay engaged in a group activity. Could be better quality and design.
5,Hysterically Funny!,"She's hysterically funny and durable with wonderful creatures! Mine wasn't sewn inside her tummy which I had to rectify -- and she didn't come with underpants (a mistake?)... But, all in all, a fantastic purchase!"
3,"Cute, but not durable","I bought this toy on the recommendation of a friend for my 2-year-old granddaughter. While it is very cute, used together with the song (book), there were 2 immediate problems with it: (1) the arms (in one piece, which circles the body) came off immediately, before we played with it; (2) there is no fly among the animals! There is, however, a little goat, which does not appear in the song. We can sew on the arms and create a fly, but why?? The price has gone down since I bought the product in December, but I still question its value."
1,disappointed!!,Why oh Why doesn't she come with a FLY?? the whole point of the story. This item didn't come with several of the animals from the book. It's also NOT as cute as the picture. I still like the idea of the toy and I'm keeping it but would NEVER buy this item again or recommend it!!!However Amazon is amazing and sent out a replacement quick with delivery scheduled before Chirstmas.
3,CD of the song that goes with doll,I did not receive the CD that goes with the doll. What's the point in the doll without the song?
2,"Okay, but too fluffy-bunny","This book has good intentions but obviously is trying to appeal to young teens that know next to nothing about the Craft. The spells are what really put me off, because even though the author considers herself a learned witch, she lists hexes and potions with titles like ""for finding your soul mate"". The simplistic spells aren't thought through and could have disastrous results. Not a good first book for young wiccans."
2,Not worth it,"I have to agree with one of the other posters. I cannot understand all of the positive reviews. While the insights into the era were interesting, the story wandered here and there. The references to celebrities seemed like so much name-dropping and did little to forward the plot. Speaking of which - what was the plot? Events occur with little insight into why the characters acted as they did. The ending was very unsatisfying and left many questions unanswered - except by that time I didn't care. Maybe it was the Kindle version, but there were often no separations between different story lines so that it skipped from one event to another without warning the reader of the change in characters and situations, making it difficult to follow at times."
2,sloppy work,"bedtime for bonzo, starring ronald reagan and a monkey was not released until 1951, but reagan had already been in lots of other movies that could have been used, like ""knute rockne, all american."" also: jen goes to dc on a train, arrives at union station but then they drive in from the airport! if these details are wrong, what else is? p.s. the book does not flow very well, very jumpy and then a sudden dead ending."
1,Just don't understand why everyone loved it.,"I just finished ""Stage Door Canteen"" by Maggie Davis and I can't understand why it got such great reviews. I found the characters flat and uninteresting. The story follows three women as they work at the famed Stage Door Canteen in New York City during the war and the men that they meet.Besides not liking the characters at time I felt that I was getting a Broadway history lesson about the show Oklahoma! I really love books set in World War 2, but I found impossible to like ""Stage Door Canteen"""
4,Asus P5NSLI,Not such a strong showing from Asus on this product. Serial ATA drive fail to load under Windows 7 RC1. IDE drive running stable. The chipset now overheating when multitasking. No more NVidia chipset on Intel socket boards for me
2,A-Z of Nothing?,"This book was written in the U.K. and I found the writing is slanted toward information not pertaining as much to breeds in the U.S. The book was filled with grammatical and typographical errors, and it is out-of-date for anyone ordering in the year 2000 or later. The A-Z descriptions were trite, and I was unable to find many things I was looking for, such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease and other current diagnoses. Sadly, this book was of no help to me."
4,Family Reading for New Dog Owners,"We were contemplating dog adoption. We filled out papers, purchased food and dog items. Once we were at the counter, we learned that the dog had some form of skin irritation and it had to go to the VET before we could adopt. WOW! This made us think we really needed to learn more about dog illnesses. We got the book! The reference that refers to female dogs (Bxtch) had to be explained to our young son's. Therefore, the book doesn't seem to be for everyone. Although, it is very informative."
1,Mom of a Girl Finally,"I bought this rug to use in my daughters room, but decided I did not really need a rug. I was going to use it as a wall hanging and upon hanging it up I noticed that it is flamable!!! I thought OH MY, how can they make and sell an item for a babys room that does not meet flamability standards. I rolled it back up and took it back to the store immediatly. I gave it one star because you have to give it something."
2,OK,"The book ""The Teacher who couldn't read"" , started to slow all to the mid. but as I read along I couldn't put it down."
3,A Rare Sean Shaver Book,"This is probably the rarest of Sean Shavers books. It is not his best either content wise or photo wise. Many of the photos are blurry or look like they were re-touched and look like paintings. I believe this is the first one that he wrote and it shows. That said, the photos are rare and good. He tells a lot of stories about how he got started and how he took some of the pictures. It's pretty funny to hear how he talks about keeping his techniques secret from other wannabe photographers. Petty maybe but nontheless entertaining. Sean's last book called Elvis In Focus is essentially a re-write of this book with better quality. The fact that this book has some different photos and different stories makes it worth finding. A word of caution- the last time I got an e-mail from Sean he said that he had only 2 copies of this book left and if I wanted to know the price I had to ask him. As with all of his books, it is hard to find and expensive."
4,Bought for my granddaughters,"I bought this after looking at the doll beds of other companies and being disappointed with their quality. My granddaughter (age 2 1/2) loved it from the moment she saw it. Yes, it would be nice if it folded up, but then I'd worry about her little fingers. It's just the right size for her stuffed creatures and her baby doll. I highly recommend it."
5,doll crib,"We bought this crib for our grandaughter, for Christmas. My husband put it together. Instructions were in the box but were not needed. It assembled quickly and easily and it is just adorable. Very happy with it."
4,Good doll bed,"My daughter got this doll bed from Santa, and she really likes it, especially because it is similar to her baby sister's pack and play. It seems very durable. I just wish is was a couple inches longer because her baby doll's head and feel touch the ends. However, overall, we are happy with it. It is very cute, and was very easy to put together."
5,Corolle Mon Premier Doll Bed,It is really a great product. My daughter loves it. Durable and fits perfect in any place. She actually was able to fit up to 6 of her babies.
4,Great purchase,"Very pretty and useful toy, big enough to accommodate more than a baby. Would have been even nicer to have a mattress, we made one out of a baby pillow."
3,wrong parts,"While putting this toy together for my granddaughter on Christmas eve, we found they had sent the wrong stabelizing parts and my husband had to make new ones. Will not order from them again."
1,Peter's review,"I recently had to read this book for college. It is probably the worst book that I have ever read. It is so boring all of the stories usually feature a character sitting around not doing anything. There are hardly any events, this book is so slow and boring. I started reading it in June and finished in September and the book is only 197 pages. This was a great waste of my summer. I hate this book."
3,Timeless classic,As always Louisa May Alcott gives us very enjoyable reading. As always a book that calls for more than one reading.
2,Cheap! As in quality,"Very thin and flimsy, with very poor shape. Hardly any bowl. Could have gotten a whole set for the same price. Guess I'll keep looking."
5,My favorite spoon,I use an enamel coated cast iron pan to make rice about every other day and I bought this spoon for that. Now I use it for everything. It is light but more importantly it does not seem to absorb liquid despite the fact that it does not seem to be coated with anything. It is a perfect medium sized and shaped spoon. I think I am sold on bamboo cooking utensils because I also bought a bamboo stir fry spatula from Joyce Chen and that is now my other go to utensil. They have a tighter thinner edge than regular wood spoons can be made to and I like the difference.
3,Chipped after first use.,"Disappointed with this spoon. Has a really nice finish, grip, and feel, but the tip of the spoon chipped after the first use. The chip is not significant, but it seems that it should have lasted a little longer before this common wear occurs."
3,Works fine,I'm certainly not an expert on these utensils. I purchased a number of these in different sizes. Was smaller than it appears in photos. Very light weight. Seems to hold up in dishwasher. Overall not overly impressed though it gets the job done. Might purchase again.
4,Good quality,"I like cooking with bamboo spoons. I bought this Joyce Chen bamboo spoon to replace my 20+ yr old bamboo spoon, which I use always. This Joyce Chen spoon is the right size, but the handle is a bit too wide for me to say it's perfect. But, I'm sure I'll get use to it. It does seem to be of good quality though."
3,Health Promotion Programs,The book is easy to read and it was in great condition. The arrival time came perfectly in time. Thanks!
1,Umm,I would love to give this shipper a good review but there's no way of contacting them about my book!There's no contact information?
5,Excelent Transaction!,Package was received in a timely manner. Product arrived as described. Will do business with again.
5,ALICE COOPER'S BEST WORK EVER,It's Great!!! Makes me feel 20 years younger every time I listen to it.
3,Alice Cooper Stage,"My favorite releases of Alice Cooper are Flush The Fashion, Zipper Catches Skin, Dragontown, and Brutal Planet, but this one has some good songs and is great for my collection."
3,INTERESTING,"Coop has three of his best songs of all time on here.From The Inside,Serious and How Ya Gonna See Me Now but the rest of the album flops."
5,Absolutely awesome!,"I'm so excited to find this album. I've looked in stores but they don't have the good taste to carry it. I first heard this record as a teenager. My friend & I listened to it over & over. The album cover was sooooooooo cool. It opened and the inside was an insane asylum with Alice huddled in a corner, the back showed everyone escaping. This album is very memorable and different from anything you have ever heard. A must have for anyone who likes metal/hard rock."
5,Awesome album,"I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Bernie Taupin, longtime collaborator with Elton John, was heavily involved on this album. Buy it!"
4,ALICE FALLS DOWN ON THE FLOOR- AGAIN AND AGAIN AND....,"Yep. You can really feel the emotions this man was going through! It is sad that some folks have to practically destroy themselves in order to bring out the best in their creativity (a la Syd Barrett). This album has the absolute best soft Cooper there is. Because it it real. A man whose persona was a fake, a fabrication of the imagination, a rock'n'roll spectacle, Vince Fournier bares his soul from the inside. The only thiing preventing the big 5 star rating is some of the rocker songs, like Beverly Hills, which are crummy. This album would have hit me like 2 tons of bricks instead of 1 if ALL the songs were sad and sincere enough to make me feel like I was crazy. I just skip the filler parts. FROM THE INSIDE IS BIG TIME UNDERRATED. This makes GOES TO HELL sound like total garbage. Highly recommended. I found an original promo sealed LP a few months back for 2 bucks at a flea market in Jefferson Parish, LA. Don't give up looking!"
2,A Vince Furnier Record,"I hate this record. Why? It should have been recorded under the name Vince Furnier. It's the point where Alice loses his ferocity and sex appeal (never genuinely regained). The character Alice died from alcohol abuse after ""Lace and Whiskey."" ""From The Inside"" is a decent, honest sounding collection of tunes done commercial 70's style. He could've broken away from the character ""Alice"" and became something more than the parody of Alice he was destined to become. If you're determined to lie to yourself and think that this album is something to buy, then listen to ""Quiet Room"" and ""Nurse Rozetta."" Atleast those two are great. A star for each."
1,very misleading,"i was told that this cd was new and paid the price for anew one,but instead received a used repackaged copy,thanks alot amazon for once again deceiving the general public"
1,The embarrassment continues,"This album completes Alice's ""Embarrassment Trilogy"" which also includes ""Goes To Hell"" and ""Lace & Whiskey"". Outside of the song ""From the Inside"" this is Alice at an all-time low. Be forewarned!"
5,From the inside CD,I couldn't find this CD anywhere. I was shocked when I found it on amazon!! It was brand new to. Great price and fast shipping. It just doesn't get any better than that!!
5,Answers questions before you can ask.,"This is a wondrous work. I don't usually go in for stuff that is ""channelled"" for obvious reasons, but this book will leave you shaken with words from a 3,000 plus year old entity that are eerily applicable to modern times. For answers to questions about why civilization evolves the way it does and the hidden patterns inherent in every age, this book is unbelievably on target and thoroughly readable! I loved it!"
5,"A ""Must Have"" Book",This book is a complete book for understanding the Ancient Mysteries and more. Every time you read this book you will take away what you are needing at the time. I recommend this book highly to anyone that is in search of the ancient mystery teachings. It helps you understand YOUR evolution as well as the world's as a whole.
1,Don't waste your time or money,"When I bought this book, I thought it would provide me with some insight into an ancient spiritual path. Instead it provided yet another 'channeled entity' with not much more to share than a bunch of rehashed bits of common sense and 'wisdom.' Dull reading and predictable. Don't waste your time or money!"
3,Not too shabby,"These two books (this one & Wayward Moon the sequel) are a couple days' pleasant diversion. The SF world is central to the mysteries and how they are solved. The mysteries are well imagined and quite logical. The characters are...well, mostly believable. The aliens are more believable.But this series despite it's high-tech, metaphysical future remains a pale reflection of the author's other SF mystery series. Denise Vitola (the author's real name) has a series of five books about a ""werewolf"" in a decidedly lower-tech (and more believable) future. Ty really isn't a werewolf, but you'll have to read those superior books to find out why.All that said, if you have finished those five books, these two are not a bad follow up...they just read like an author's first attempt when held up against the others."
2,copper-toned jar,"This jar is quite beautiful, but not practical. I was worried about actually putting cookies inside as it does not look like something made for holding food. So I use it for wrapped snacks like crackers and small packages of treats. The bottom, unfortunately, had several small defects and when my counterspace was wet the copper leaked rust colored stains on to my countertop (which I was able to remove); I coated the entire bottom of the jar with clear nail polish and have had no recurrence of the problem. So, it looks great, but not used for what I had intended, putting cookies in it."
5,Terriffic resource!,"I've used by copy over and over for years-- its for children but I use it myself. This is a giant oversized book gives an excellent visual overview of Jewish history, beginning approximately 5,000 years before the birth of Christ and ending with the present time. A time line summarizes the text and places Jewish history in the context of general world history. Includes 300 photographs, maps, charts, and drawings."
3,"Good album, not much like their later work.","Other reviewers are right, almost completely different direction from the later works. This album is good, reminds me of Shellac and Rapeman a little. Not that it's a bad thing. The keyboards and 60's influence set it apart from the bands I just mentioned."
1,This is not hot hot heat,"just wanted to tell you people that this is a horrible cd and it is stupid to buy this. Babies crying sound more melodic than this scratchy, loud, irritatting summation of ugly sounds. Also an important note, HOT HOT HEAT is the best band ever so do not make any assumtions on the band based on this cd. The band on this cd is lacking the guitars and the vocalist that is part of present day hot hot heat. I strongly suggest either Knock, Knock, Knock or Make up the breakdown both by HOT HOT HEAT however stay far away from and be very afraid of this cd!"
1,This is music?,"If this is considered good music then hell, everyone should get some friends with instruments, think of some lyrics, and just start playing and yelling in the microphone... because that's exactly what Hot Hot Heat did. Don't get me wrong, I think they are an awesome band, but this album just sucks.. no its worse, I would rather listen to 98 degrees then this. Hopefully there new CD won't be anything like this garbage."
2,Nice try,"Mr. Harr's ambitious novel of the Benedict Arnold story is a good attempt at best. Readers of historical fiction will not particularly enjoy this book as it's narrative is rather clumsy and the voices of it's characters are niether believable or consistant. The characters are in fact two dimensional and never really come alive. A dry recounting of events with made up dialogue and meetings to string things together, this book in no way remotely approaches the grace and scholarship of a Kenneth Roberts or O'Brian as historical fiction. The research is also somewhat suspect in a few areas."
4,Nice Little Piece of Historical Fiction,"Ok so maybe little is the wrong word to use, at 522 pages it is a weighty book. But ""Dark Eagle"" does an admiral job of being light and easy reading, and yet still staying true to it historical roots. I would compare the writing done by John Ensor Harr in this book to ""Winter Soldiers"" by Richard Ketchum. You will be left with the sense of the gray area that history includes, and the feeling that all sides of the American Revolution have been fairly represented. If I have one complaint it is that Mr. Harr choose to treat Benedict Arnold's life as being over when he switched sides, which is not the case. Benedict Arnold was a very busy and complicated man, and should been known for far more that just being a turn coat who happened to get caught."
2,Disappointment,I have read and thoroughly enjoyed the experience of the book I AM THAT.However the dvd contained very poor visuals and repeats the same materialagain and again. Actually this may be very well for study of the concepts (or non-concepts). But my final feeling was one of disappointment. The only reason I did not return it is I thought it might prove helpful to watch when unwilling to read the book. Also it can be used to explain the teachers' concepts to beginners. However be assured this dvd will never replace the book.
3,"Useful, but fell short of expectations","This man was obviously very inspirational to many, including Wolinsky who produced the video. I found the video to be highly repetitive, and much of the footage fell short of communicating his charisma."
1,Skip the DVD - read the book,This dvd has very very very little to do with the wisdom of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj. Stephen Wolinsky is marketing his own unenlightened thoughts. This is not the real thing! All this dvd did for me was show me where Wolinsky's practice stopped and his own ego-gratification took off into the land of spiritual materialism. Stick to the silence Wolinsky and let the words of the genuine masters do the teaching. Who ever gave you the permission to sell a master's name as your own?
5,The Absolute,"This is a unique and all too scarce spiritual presentation on video. Stephen Wolinsky delivers a vivid account of his remarkable experiences within the presence of a great enlightened teacher in modern times. Nisargadatta spoke from and about The Absolute. He did this from his own realizations and did not quote from other sources, nor was he a scholar, but an ordinary family man. Stephen leads an excellent guided meditation early in the program and later defines many Sanskrit terms with articulation and even clarifies the statements of the Master. One can begin to sense the state of the ineffable awareness which is that the substrate of all form and non-form is pure conciousness. To better put this in context the viewer should have some familiarity with Advaita. I recommend firstly to see the VHS/DVD ""Awaken to the Eternal"" featuring N. Maharaj. Also the three books edited by Jean Dunn, one of which is ""Prior to Conciousness"". Very well done. Enjoy.\"
4,Pam's Paradise Ranch,"I read this book as a young person, more than 40 years ago (I'm now 51), andI loved it! I would like to read it again (perhaps it worthy of 5 stars...)"
5,Very moving and hauntingly beautiful,I bought this CD after hearing Arvel play at a powwow. The Badger Boogie made me just want to get up and dance. Then the Dolphin Dances took me to another place where through the music I could almost see the dolphins swimming and dancing. A really great purchase!!
4,HILARIOUS & OUCH!,"If I am going to sum the movie up, it will be in 2 words --- Hilarious & OUCH! 2 thumbs up to Brendan Fraser aka George who was ssssoooo hilarious. However, he is somewhat typecasted into these silly comedy roles but I've seen him act in With Honors, & I'd say he's GREAT! Ouch, becaue George, despite the long years he has spent in the jungle, still has not mastered the art of swinging from one vine to another, & often bump head-on to trees. Really a big OUCH!Oh, before I forget,I love that smart talking ape! Such a shame, George did not take after the ape's agility :-)"
5,LOVE this movie.,We received this product very quickly and it was in good quality. The movie is hilarious as well! I love everything about this product.
5,URSULA WAS WONDERFUL!,The performance by Leslie Mann as URSULA was perfect. URSULA makes buying the video worthwhile.
5,Geroge of the Jungle,The recurring theme of the human raised by animals of the jungle. George of the Jungle is a comic striation of that. Funny and enjoyable.
5,Quick,"My experience was great, I purchased this DVD on Dec 21 and recieved it Dec 22. Definately recommend!!!!"
5,George of the Jungle,This movie is funny. Brendan Frasier has that way of playiing the fool and bringing cartoon characters to life. Ape is a hoot as the voice of reason.
2,George of the Jungle,"I liked this movie when it first came out, but after watching it again I thought it was just plain silly. I gave it to a relative who likes it, so someone is enjoying it. I guess I've matured beyond the silliness."
4,Lyle!!!,"Thomas Haden Church is AWESOME as Lyle Van de Groot!He's so sexy! I'd take a shower with him under the big expensive waterfall set anytime!Oh, if Ursula doesn't want him, I'll gladly take him. Somebody has to love a nice, funny, evil man."
3,George of The Jungle,"Another Christmas gift for my grandson, as per his request. Again, he must have enjoyed it in the movie theater or wouldn't have asked for it...."
3,Great supporting cast,"This movie is pretty funny. In fact, most of the funniest parts are from George's intelligent gorilla friend or the safari guides. Good fun."
3,OK,"I donno, I didn' like this that much, and I really didn't think it had many funny parts at all, but it wasn't too bad."
1,Completely wretched,The only reason I watched this movie is because I think that Brendan Fraser is a good actor. But upon seeing it I saw just how awful a movie can get. There is not one funny part in the movie. It is totally moronic and unfunny.
1,What a Pathetic Film!,"This film was a total waste of time. I almost walked out of the movie theater since the film seemed to go on forever. The humor, if you can call it that, was hard to endure. Brendan Fraser was ridiculous, he has NO acting ability. Good looks can not compensate for intelligence. The rest of the cast only made things worse. Don't waste your time or money on this video- it's dreadful!"
4,"Fun Movie, Poor DVD Package","A friend gave my kids this movie--I didn't buy it because the idea of a live-action GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE seemed silly to me. Fortunately for my family, this movie is silly in a good way, gleefully silly, with lots of physical comedy, puns, in-jokes, and high ridiculousness. This movie has good-natured fun. The casting of Fraser and Mann as George and Ursula is inspired, and Cleese as the voice of Ape works wonders. Movies that elicit joyful instead of derisive laughter deserve our attention, so unless you're sensitive about the requisite animal excrement jokes (the easiest way to avoid a ""G"" rating), watch this movie with your kids. Then watch it with your buddies. It might even be a good date movie.The DVD package, however, offers another example of Disney's charging premium prices for few extras. Unfortunately, the disc is also pan-and-scan instead of widescreen. If you already own the videotape, you might as well wait and hope that Disney upgrades the DVD package."
5,About the DVD... Widescreen or pan-and-scan?,"This film is only available in full screen but you are not missing anything because the widescreen version is the same 4:3 picture cropped for 1.77:1. How do I know this? Because I actually invested a lot of money for a rare ""widescreen"" laserdisc of this film on eBay only to find out that the ""widescreen"" image was really a cropped version of the (original) 4:3 version. Disney's favourite aspect ratio is 1.66:1, which means that films are filmed in 4:3 and then hard matted down to 1.66:1 for theatrical release and then to 1.77:1 for DVD. It would have been nice to have the added resolution of an ""enhanced for widescreen"" 1.77:1 DVD since I own a widescreen TV, but at least now I know the film is full screen and NOT pan-and-scan. And this format shows a lot more Brendan Fraser, if you know what I mean...:-)"
5,Goofy fun,"So what if this movie was goofy..that was the point! This quirky comedy ranks high on my recommended list..its just too good to pass up! Besides, who can pass up the hunky Brandon in a loincloth...certainly not I! :-)"
2,Not a whole set,"I thought I was purchasing the whole Spring 07 set, although considering the price, that may have been silly thinking. Anyways, only one bottle came and it is an off white color, which is not something I really want on my nails... Essie is great polish! It dries quickly and goes on well, plus I love the applicator brush, for some reason it just feels better than others. I'm not happy with this particular color but I will buy more Essie products in the future."
4,On Not Being Able to Paint,"""Ultimately this books calls into question the separation of self from other, of feelings from things, and the distance between inner and outer worlds, and explores art's unique ability to transcend these divisions."" -- John Houck on Marion Milner's ""On Not Being Able to Paint""Read the full review on the Art Book Review:[...]"
2,A nice mini mouse but after a couple of months It doesn't work,"It's a very nice and portable mouse, when I bout this mouse, I did for two things,the brand (GE) and price. but after a couple of months always happen that windows show me a message ""a USB device it doesn't work properly"" and after that mesage the mouse was freeze"". Now I Need to buy other one, but never a GE mouse."
1,---------------J--U--N--K---------------------------------------------,The spring loaded retractor seems to randomly SNAP the mouse right out of your hand at the most inopportune moments....and then the whole thing just stops working after a few months - certainly less than a year.Save your money.
4,Very Handy,I love having a mouse to use with my laptop away from home. If I use only the touchpad my elbow hurts a lot - so I use the mouse a lot. And I'm surprised at how little wire I unroll to use it. I don't like wireless mice because I tend to lose them. This is small and convenient. The only drawback is that occasionally I have a hard time getting the wire to automatically roll up.
2,Defective after just two months,"The mouse is comfortable and smooth but after just two months, I press the mouse once and it doubles things up--moving a web page back twice or on a calculator, typing the number ""1"" twice. It also won't enable me to take copy and delete it properly. Very irritating and very useless now."
1,Hard on the ears,"I bought these field recordings due to the Laswell connection.I found this cd hard to listen to.You get sounds with people talking in the background, some native music, some vocals,percussion and drones .Alot was unlistenable noise as if on a bus in a forign land and OZ recorded the sounds.Reminds me of the soundtrack to a National Geographic movie."
2,Yoga for Physical Looks and Health,"This is a women's book for self-study of Yoga for natural cosmetic improvement and general health. The emphasis is on delaying aging and bettering looks. The authors have provided the basics of Yoga with emphasis on breathing. The asanas are described well. There is a black and white photo for almost every asana. Beginning breathing techniques are included. Lifestyle with discipline, body-shaping, body building, and natural child birth are all addressed. There is a Table of beautifying and therapeutic asanas, and Sanskrit names for asanas at the end of the book.The authors were well-known in Australia and had success with their program in the 1960s. This book is all about using Yoga for better looks, health, better outlook on life. Yoga is not treated here as a spiritual science, even though the authors do make the statement in the beginning chapter that `mind and spirit are equally involved'."
5,Excellent text,"I had the very fortunate opportunity to take Dr. Moyle's ichthyology class at UC Davis. We used this book as our text. The book was very helpful, and well explained. Moyle and Cech go into a great amount of detail in this text, and yet convey it in a straightforward and understandable way."
5,Pretty Solid,"The authors did a great job with diagrams, fish anatomy, and physiological descriptions. Probably the most interesting section of this book is the ecology. Though some sections were more scientific than others and hard to keep focus at times, I still highly recommend this book to students or beginners."
3,"Difficult to read, but packed with information","For someone who just got through Biology 1 and 2, I get bogged down with the technical language used in this book (that cannot be found in the index). Once I get past that aspect, it is filled with in-depth information. As a visual learner, I feel that this book could use some more pictures. This would be a great book if you plan on going into aquatic Biology as a major or for graduate school, but the average student could lose focus and interest quickly."
5,IT'S ALL ABOUT THE TRIPLE SIX,"Thriple 6 does it again. DJ PAUL is the tightest rapper in the game right now, plus he lays down the tracks like only someone from the M-Town Can. Buy It!"
5,The Ultimate Album,"DJ Paul and Juicy J are own top of their game with this album. You ain't know. If you love that down south flava, where the bass can be heard a block away from your ride,Then get this here album. On da real, you'll really like this one. The beats are unique, and the chorus on the tracks are catchy. This is an album to ride to, get crunk on, and to get the party hype. I haven't got da movie yet, but I'm going to check that out too."
4,DJ Paul and Juicy J Do it Again!!,"From ""Tear Da Club Up"" to ""Slob on My Knob"" to ""Sippin on Syrup"" DJ Paul and Juicy J (Da Checkwriters for Hypnotize Minds) have gotten us used to some classic beats and production. They have done it again and again producing marks like Skinny Pimp and real G's like Project Pat and La Chat. They don't disappoint on the ""Choices"" Soundtrack. The beats are wicked--like you would expect from the Triple Six. With guests like Ludacris, Project Pat, La Chat, and T-Rock, Three Six Mafia takes it to a new level. This CD will make you bob your head and chant to the lyrics. I used to front on Three Six Mafia until I started to really listen to their work. I never had given them a chance. Now Three Six and their affiliates are all I listen to. Don't you make the same mistake I made in the past. Go buy everything you can get your hands on that has DJ Paul and Juicy J as the producers. You can't go wrong. They run the rap game!"
5,Triple 6 has done it AGAIN,"Three 6 has once again made a classic album, and if u love their tight beats and ill lyrics, than u should definently get this album cause it is off da hizzoook!! I can't wait till their new album, ""Da Unbreakables"" comes out in DEC., hopefully itll be as good as this one, because ""choices"" is right up their wit 66-61, and the best songs are, nah, all of them! Get IT"
1,REALLY... not a Region 1 DVD,"I wish I had bothered to read the earlier review (written last Sept) before ordering this DVD. This is a Region 2 DVD playable in the UK but not in the US. This is the first time ever I've been unhappy with Amazon: (1) They persist in advertising this as a Region 1 DVD even though a reviewer posted this problem last September. (2) I keep getting inappropriate computer-generated answers to my queries telling me how to find this DVD on their website and explaining about DVD regions. When a human being finally responded, he wrote to say that Amazon is sending me a ""replacement"" but I have feeling that this will be a duplicate Region 2. If this turns out to be a Region 1 DVD, I will write to retract this review. In the meantime, buyer beware!"
1,This is not a region one DVD,"I purchased this DVD based on the encoding being region one, but it is not. It is truly an import, and can not be played on standard US DVD players. I am keeping the DVD since I plan on buying a multi-regional player in the future. I'm sure the performance is great, but don't purchase this if it won't play in your player."
5,Cute and durable,"This is really cute--bright colors and well made. My daughter is pretty rough on toys, and this has lasted a year and still looks good."
3,Production simply short-changed Burton,"This CD is a must for the diehard collector, given that it isa singular effort, but falls far short of demonstrating theskills of the talented Burton. Once can't help but believe that it was hastily produced in someone's spare time with little regard for quality and marketability. If you really want an appreciation for Burton's guitar mastership, just listen to various Elvis and/or Rick Nelson songs where Burton plays leadguitar with skill and panache. This CD is quite disappointing in comparison."
2,Keep Lookin',"This album is VERY DATED! He is an excellent guitarist, a legend, but this release doesn't capture his abilities as other recordings have. The story is that Elvis Presley didn't show up for a recording session. However, they had the players and the session time already booked, so they had Burton make this album instead. He had no preparation time.If you are an all-out Burton fan then maybe this belongs in your collection. (But only as a curiosity). Otherwise, keep lookin!"
1,guitar sounds of james burton,"Im sorry James after being a hugh fan from Rick Nelson days <and a musio still playing in rock band> I found this album a disappointment not only was the recording a little flat in its overall sound but the playing very un uninspireing, almost like James was not playing from the heart a bit like when some musio,s back artist,s reading charts that they are not familiar with it also has that 70,s plastickey sound ,,so sorry James not your best."
2,Just Terrible!!,James Burton is a great guitar player. When he is playing behind someone else. This album is just just too cheesy. A waste of money.
5,An excellent introduction to Cultural Studies,This makes an excellent introductory text for students of Cultural Studies. It's ideal for a 100 or 200-level college course.
2,An enumeration of games.,There is a little explenation of the Najdorf in the introduction. After that there is not a single line of comment in the given games. And in these days in in which you can download all the games to your computer I don't see the advantage of a book like this. A small advantage of this book that it contains a lot of games.
5,Good Movie,"Action movie, full of great paradoxes that you will love ! Also Ricardo Darin'sgreat executed character will leave you enjoying every minute of it !. I ordered2 other movies with him, great actor in great films !"
3,Dark side of the human existance in a light-hearted Hollywoodesque fashion,"""Nine Queens"" (from the Spanish, Nueve Reinas), is a movie thatdeals with the dark side of the human existance, told in a waythat is quite the opposite, in a light-hearted, entertaining,Hollywoodesque fashion.Having seen a few of these pictures running in a similar vein,this picture doesn't take itself too seriously, and for thatvery reason, suceeds in carrying the suspense, and drama untilthe very end, that itself, is incredibly surprising.The viewer mustn't make the error of judging the movie by thefirst 3 minutes as it will obviously be underestimated.Although obviously morally reprehensible and dispicable, in itsneutral treatment of grifting as an occupation, meaning theprotagonists playing in the movie, neither the story would workor the entertainment value be present, had the behavior been atarget of moral judgment and of social critique.The unspoken underlying reality is obviously understood, Amovie is a movie."
3,nine queend,the movie was ok.. i just bought beacuse my boyfriend wanted itbut the movie case came broken
3,Who is conning who?,"Nine Queens is a pretty good Argentinean movie full of cons and twists that you are never really sure who is cunning who. Two con men partner to carry out a con that will get them a lot of money: selling a counterfeit copy of the Nine Queens Stamps. Along the way to carry their con they have to deal with conning each other, staying sharp, theft of the nine queens, people that want money to stay quiet and a sister that a bit bitter about an inheritance she was supposed to get and never received. Too bad they really need her help to carry out the con. The movie keeps you interested in what is going on and very concentrated trying to figure out who is cunning who. The movie has tons of twists, turns and cons that keep on coming to the very end."
4,Nine Queens,I really liked the movie. It kept your attention throughout. It also had many surprises to keep you entertained.
4,"Perfect For Cats, Too!","My cat loves to ride in the car and hates being in the carrier. She likes to look around. With this car seat, she can stay in my sight, still be able to look around at all the cars outside, and be close to her Mommy (which is better than her trying to sit on my lap) The only problem is that it fits a little bit weird over racerback seats. Bucket seats would probably be better. Overall, though, I'm glad I bought this product, despite the hilarious comments from my friends."
1,Not making any sense,"This is not a Christian teaching book, if it was written by some atheist I will give the book five stars, but to be written by some one proclaiming himself a priest and Christian I should give it zero star if I have this choice.The identity of the author is not clear, his ideas does not make any sense with the reality, There is a big difference between Love and sex but the author ignored this fact to deceive people with no religion or to the people who don't have a real background about Christianity, the Christianity never been anti women actually there are too many Christians praise Virgin Mary more than any body else, this is false teaching. The Christianity is against any kind of sex outside marriage including homosexuality so what is his point?, this is false teaching, and not representing Christianity at any level, again his identity is not clear the same as the serpent who deceived Eve with the familiar story we all know, if I compare I don't see much difference."
4,Living in Sin?: A Bishop Rethinks Human Sexuality,Very insightful. The author has a great way of connecting common sense to life. Bishop Spong enables one to see the Bible from a historical perspective and bring new light to the scriptures.
2,passionate but shallow,"Here's something, that you should read if you want to get an idea of what the liberal Christianity is saying on sexuality. However, I would not recommend to take it seriously. It is short on facts and Biblical interpretation, long on caricature, and tainted too much with the obvious bias of the author. There are better books on the subject."
1,An atheistic view of sexuality,"Spong may indeed be a member of the cloth, but if you want to know how an atheist views sexuality, read this book. I found his approach dishonest and his judgment poor. Why pretend to be something you're not (as Spong does when he pretends to represent the Christian view)? There are certainly far better books about human sexuality to be found on the market. Skip this one."
2,Horrible entry into the Tomie franchise,"I am one of those few who genuinely like the Tomie franchise, and I was sorely disappointed by this film. The lead actress, Hisako Shirata, is quite good... but the script and HD video look kill the film. They try so hard to explain what Tomie is, that the dread, fear and suspense is gone. The gore is there, sure... but without a good story, who cares? Also, the CGI effects are, as usual, bad.I suppose the people who found the first Tomie slow, confusing and boring might enjoy this, but everyone else, beware. Get the Tomie box-set (with the best 3 films in it) instead."
2,Dropping Off (a Cliff),"I liked the Tomie additions that I had seen - until i ran into this one. I do not want to waste a lot of time on it because i don't think you should say too much on the negative side. Instead, it should be noted that the problems are visual, that the sound is bad, that the story is not really there, and that this does not fit into the Tomie additions. I thought the acting was good enough - hence the addition of a star - BUT that I would not have bothered getting this had I known what I was walking into.It is sad to see Ito's creation here but do not take it out on all the Tomie movies. Some of them are rather good and this is more like an exception than the thing you expect."
2,Probably the worst Tomie Film yet!,This film is one of two Tomie movies that came out following the first five movies. It was done all wrong and the back of the box pretty much sums the entire movie. It starts out good but then you can lose interest really quick. Also the actress that plays Tomie wasn't all that pretty either and supposedly all men fall for her because shes drop dead beautiful. The conclusion was really predictable and this film is too short. I wouldn't recommend this movie at all. Get Tomie The Beginning which as a lot better than this one.
5,Great addition to the storybook,"Just like the other ASL storybooks! I was pleased to see the signing was going along with the pages in the book. I didn't know what to expect it would be like but quite pleased with the format. They zoom into a page in the book, added a small bit of animation to the page & then the signer is super-imposed onto the screen. The book is being narrated at the same time. My 25 year old niece with Downs Syndrome lived it! We both loved Manny Rodriguez (one of the signers)!"
3,Goodnight Moon - classic story brought to DVD,"My daughter is now 23 months old, and hardly a night has gone by when we have not read Goodnight Moon. It is a part of our daily routine. When I found a version on DVD with sign language, I jumped at the chance to get it.We have watched it a couple of times now. My daughter is enjoying it very much. The only thing that keeps me from rating it 5-star is that the sign language interpreter never smiles. In fact, her face is almost sour looking. As an adult I find that distracting. All-in-all though, still a good purchase."
3,The Last One,"It's Maynard Ferguson's last CD...so that makes it special all by itself. Certainly the Boss continued to amaze all right up to the end. And much has been made of his ""resurgence"" in recent months with the new horn and all.But candidly, this recording was too late. The band is not the top line it could have been.Patrick Hession does a great job on lead trumpet and plays some wild notes in the Hit Medley covering the Boss's old parts. Stockton Helbing is a fine and gifted drummer who has matured nicely as part of the band over the years, graduating to music director this go round.But otherwise, not the greatest performance turned in.Still, a worthwhile buy because it was the final new recording of one of the all time great impact trumpeters."
4,CD,"It was a good CD, but took way to long to get it, according to what I paid to get it here on time."
3,LOT'S OF GOOD INFO.,"GOOD BOOK WITH A NICE LAY OUT FOR WORKING,WITH LOT'S OF INFO ON HOW TO DO THE WORK AND WHERE TO TAKE IT TO GET THE WORK DONE(IF IT'S MORE THAN YOUR ABILITIES WILL ALOW YOU TO TRY)READ IT FRONT TO BACK FIRST NIGHT I GOT IT."
2,Do not buy this pool!,"This is the most frustrating piece of equipment I own! Unless you have a professionally leveled piece of land it will not set up right. Last year it took me 4 fills before I finally gave up and said ""good enough"" even though on one side there was still about 8 inches of wall when I lifted up the ring. If you don't guide the filling every step of the way it will go up slanted, /__/ ,and not straight up. This year the ring has holes in every place it was folded for winter storage in my finished basement. I've found 7 of the holes, but the ring is still leaking so there must be more. I'll be buying a different pool for next year!"
1,Need a completely level lawn,"This will be the 4th weekend we have tried to get this pool up. As other reviewers stated unless your lawn is completely level you will have problems. Our lawn was about 8"" off. We filled in with sand,surrounded by boards, raked, used a level, used string, did everything we were supposed to. When we filled we could tell it was a little off. My daughter got in, water started going over the off side and then it was like a tidal wave and washed sand away. This was going to be my mother's day dream present and it has turned into my worst nightmare."
5,MASTERPIECE!!!,Literally!!!Brilliant!!!Pasolini is beyond reproach!!!!Go watch yer Hollywood super sound pictures for technical perfection!!!For heart and soul on the screen this is among the best!!
1,Beware of the unworthy DVD,"Beware, and read the details carefully. This DVD is only in dubbed English, which destroys the originality of the film. Quite unforgivable. Don't buy this."
1,Not Secure,"Although well constructed this carrier has a serious design flaw.The top tabs by the carrier handle do not fold back and lock down.It is very easy for the tabs to slip out and have the carrier open.This almost happened in the parking lot when I took my cat to the Vet.The top had already slipped down in transit, fortunately I yanked it up in time.The only way to make this carrier secure is to duct tape it."
5,Just what I,"I used this to wrap a Christmas gift but found it would be very useful for it's intended use, too. Easy to assemble."
1,Filmsy!,My male cat tore thruogh it immediately. I did not have a spare so I had to use sturdy duct tape as a temporary remedy.Cute decorations but unless you are carrying a small placid mouse I can not recomend this product.
2,my cat ripped it to shreds,"my cat ripped the bottom of this to shreds. I almost lost him in the street on the way to the vet. If you do need a temporary carrior and buy this one, make sure to secure it with strong tape! I guess all these cardboard carriers are prone to some damage.. lol"
1,Not a cat carrier!,"It may be big enough for a cat but it will not contain them. I bought three to get some outdoor strays fixed not wanting to invest in the more expensive plastic carriers. On the twenty min drive to the vet two of the three had escaped they're carrier. The air holes are large enough for their paws giving them hope of escape. So they chew, and tear at them untill their head fits through & once that happens its only minutes untill the rest of their body is out. The one that made it to the vet in this carrier escaped on the way home by getting her claws in the top & pulling down untill the sides released and voila she was out without damaging the box or consuming cardboard. I ended up purchasing plastic carriers & wish I would have saved the cost & shipping of these useless things. Unless you own a declawed, stupid, fat cat & only want them contained for 15 min or less I wouldnt waste the money."
4,Norpro,It is a very good pot. But too small for two portions of spagetti. Enough for two portions of short pasta.
3,What happened to Elsa?,"In the previous book of the series Elsa was a very likeable character; independent, caring and trying to do her best with her orphaned brother. But in this book she became a sanctimonious, social climbing, money hungry snob.Her goal was to marry a rich, powerful, socially respected man. Rafe was one of the good guys and understood what was important in life. It's a mystery why he was attracted to her.I was really looking forward to this book and was very disappointed."
2,Bland & Disappointing,"I love the other Mannheim Steamroller Christmas albums, but this one falls short. For those looking for the energy and enthusiasm one normally associates with Mannheim's albums, you will seek in vain. There are some nice numbers on this album, but even those are not at all distinctive. This album isn't quite as bad as elevator music, but you'll be asleep long before the concluding Auld Land Syne."
5,Best Mannheim Steamroller in Years,"This is the best Mannheim Steamroller Christmas CD to be released in the last few years and I have them all. My whole family agrees, even my 3 teenagers who are musicians and big fans of Mannheim Steamroller. This CD was a great addition to our Christmas Music collection!"
2,"Got me going, but it did not capture the magic for me...","I LOVE Chip Davis and all of his Fresh Aire and Christmas stuff, and I was SO excited about getting this one...and lets just say that I was left a bit limp after this one, after so many truly heartwarming and moving experiences that I personally felt with a lot of MS's material. So, I pop the ole 'brown' CD in, that has so many well-orchestrated numbers, and xmas is back...SO, tell me Chip, was this less-than-extraordinaire effort worth it???? I mean, really, your stuff has touched me from so many ways that I cannot count...and the magic that you create with your music is way beyond this xmas wank...so what is next mate??"
2,Not up to par,"I own all of the previous Mannheim Steamroller Christmas albums, and I have greatly enjoyed them. However, this one just doesn't cut it. Each of the previous albums has had at least one standout song, and apparently the ""Hallelujah Chorus"" was supposed to fit that bill on this album. But that's one of the most exciting pieces ever written, and the blah new-age arrangement here just ruins it. The piece from Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker is similarly much better in its original form. Chip Davis has succeeded in the past by taking familiar Christmas tunes and rearranging them in new and exciting ways, but there aren't any tracks on this album that fit that category."
2,Christmas Extraordinaire ~ Mannheim Steamroller,"Christmas Extraordinaire is an insipidly arranged and performed package of Christmas standards. It looked very promising, with rennaissance instruments (lute, crumhorns, harpsichord), but its saccharine production and arrangements leave me on the cool side of lukewarm. On the plus side, the collection is in memory of the producer's father."
2,Not quite up to previous efforts,"It seems there are always a few good tracks on every SteamrollerCD. This one is no exception. The rest is mediocre at best. Maybe they're getting old, maybe they have run out of things to say. I wasn't impressed by the musicianship or the artistic endeavor."
2,Disappointing-Not Up to Mannheim Steamroller's Standard,"I really enjoyed the first three Mannheim Steamroller Christmas CDs, but this one left me feeling cheated.First of all, there isn't much music on this CD. If this had been a reissue of a phonograph LP, I might have accepted this, but CDs can hold a lot more music than this.Second, what was there was very thin and bland. Where the previous CDs had been imaginative this one was just...there. After it ran through its short playlist, I felt no great need to hear it again.Unless you feel the need to own the complete Mannheim Steamroller catalog, there is no need to buy this CD. And you won't miss it either."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!,"This was a complete waste of money!!I absolutely loved the 1st three CDs. I did not think I needed to listen to this one, but I sure wish I had. It sounded like they made this CD with no thought put into it. It gave me the impression that he wanted to make some quick cash for the holidays.I probably will not buy anymore.From now on I will be buying Trans Siberian Orchestra."
5,Another Triumph for Chip Davis and Mannheim Steamroller!,"This is the Fourth offical Christmas Album by Chip Davis andMannheim Steamroller, and I think it is the best sounding of thebunch. The only problem I have with their albums is that theyare over too soon! I think the reason that Chip decided to askJohnny Mathis to sing on this album is that like a lot of folksChip probably grew up listening to Mr. Mathis singing carol andsongs on his Christmas Albums and wanted to pay a little homageto him. Which is alright by me. Keep up the good work Chip andMannheim Steamroller!! Happy Holidays!"
2,Christmas Extraordinaire,I am a fan of Mannheim Steamroller and had high expectations for this CD. This is not quite as good as their older Christmas Cd's. It is ok but far from what it could have been.
1,I Just Don't Get It....,"I have heard music by Mannheim Steamroller, and I have heard many, many people sing praises for their music. I just don't get the big deal. To me, their stuff is horrible. It sounds like a 5-year old was handed a synthesizer, and was told ""Play some Christmas songs."" I don't understand all the people who love this music, but obviously, MS is hugely successful--so SOMEONE is buying their stuff. Are people so musically lacking that THIS is what they think ""good"" music is? If so, I am very sad for those people."
1,Christmas?!?,"First of all it ain't representing Christmas at all.So it shouldn't have this ""title"", it's totally inapropriate.There's nothing interesting in those songs, I don't know this performer and I mean I'll keep my money for something worthwhile to listen this December.Come one there will be a lot of better Christmas CDs coming soon, believe me.Don't throw your dough away, keep it and buy something greatest in late November or in early December.Just my opinion.See ya and Have a nice day!"
3,"Great CD, but mediocre for Mannheim","I always am eager to pick up the new Mannheim Steamroller album and love to listen to all of them at Christmas, so i was very excited when i heard the album was coming out. It has a collection of 12 great Christmas songs, including ""Aude Lang Syne"". But when i listened to it, i was half disappointed. This CD is alot softer that all of their other efforts, which is a bad thing, at least for me. I loved all the upbeat songs at the beginning of their 1995 effort, and this one is just lacking in that. I guess if you want upbeat phenomenal orchestrated arrangements, you should go with the Trans Siberian Orchestra. It seems like they didnt put as much effort into this album the other albums. There simply isnt enough instrumentation. It is still a good Christmas album, but falls short of expectations."
3,Mediocre,Excellent start with Hallelujah chorus and then fizzled after that with a few intermittent high points. I just did not like this particular package of songs. Too much new age sound toward the end. Wish I would have read the other reviews before purchase.
4,Wonderful Christmas tunes from Mannheim Steamroller,"This was a pleasure to listen to again!It makes nice background yule-tyde music for the winter solitice holiday celebration.The birth of Jesus also represents the growing length of sunlight and rebirth of life.Also smartly included are Johnny Mathis (O Tannenbaum),University of Michigan Men's Glee Club,Soli Deo Gloria Cantorum Women's Choir, Almeda Berkey directing.They should continue to stick with Christmas standard classics and stay away from the Halloween tunes.This wintertime CD from Mannheim Steamroller is extraordinaire indeed!"
5,Extraordinary!,"Some people say this isn't a good album, but this work was crafted entirely on fan requests, myself among them. I was one of the many who suggested Chip Davis, head composer and drummer, do an interpretation of ""Away In A Manger"", and I think he succeeded, along with all of the other modernized classics Chip has composed. I listen to Steamroller's version of Tchaikovsky's ""Dance Of The Sugarplum Faeries"" year-round! It's that good! Chip's interpretation of ""Silver Bells"" truly embodies the modern spirit of Christmas. Although Chip has done ""Auld Lang Syne"" before(in his solo ""Impressions"" album), his Christmas spin is magnificent. And his version of Handel's ""Hallelujah"" chorus was very well done. I'd say try this album yourself. You'll be glad you did."
5,cd,i love this cd. it came sooner than expected. i would order again. thanks you so much whoever you are.
4,Turn Down the Bass,"Follow-ups are never,ever quite as good as the lst. But this CD rates right up there with the lst album. But, you'd best turn down your BASS setting, BEFORE you play it! Track #1 goes right thru your shoes. Marty"
2,Hard to listen to,"I am a Mannheim Steamroller lover - but was very disappointed with this CD. I listened to it once and thought ""geez, this isn't very good."" Then I thought that maybe I should listen to it again and beieve me, it didn't get any better the second time. I am sorry that I bought it - and will not listen to it again. Will keep listening to the older CD's. I think that Hark the Herald Angels Sing is their all time best song. Perhaps they should stop making Christmas albums or put a little more thought into them."
1,Boring,"I couldn't believe this was Mannheim Steamroller! It sounds like it is a soundtrack to a Christmas movie, just background music for something more important happening. Johnny Mathis and what sounds like the Weather Monks??? I was hugely disappointed having expected a ""certain"" sound but this does not deliver, in fact it sounds generic. The only reason we have it is because my husband collects Christmas music. What a waste of money."
2,Surprisingly boring,"I like Mannheim Steamroller's other Christmas albums. So, I kind of got carried away and bought this one without listening to it ahead of time. That was a mistake. I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews, as it's remarkably boring. The tunes all sound sort of similar as most feature either bells or a generic synthesizer. The layered complexity that made their other albums gems is missing. The melodies are so broken apart as to be almost unrecognizable, which for a Christmas album is not a good thing. I recommend skipping this one altogether and getting one of their better albums (e.g. Christmas in the Aire)."
2,It really stinks!!,I was really disappointed in this cd. It is very clear he is using his name to sell this one! I saw it in the store and I said wow all new music on this one. But I decided to wait until it went on sale before I purchased it. I expected upbeat music through the whole cd. Instead it was really BORING!!! His first song on this cd is upbeat but the rest are really baaaaaaaadddddd!!!!!! I suggest that you listen to someone elses before wasting your time or money on this one. It was a great disappointment. He really let me down this time.
5,Mannheim Steamroller Christmas Extraordinaire is uplifting,Loved the cd! Very upbeat! Great gift for a music lover!
1,"Not very reliable, poor warranty","We started having problems with this monitor 6 months after purchasing it. The picture would blank out for no reason and the sound would stop. Attempts to contact Princeton for help failed. They would not answer email or phone calls. After a year the monitor stopped working altogether. We've since been able to contact Princeton, but they refuse to honor the warranty!"
3,Daphne's ancestors,"Daphne du Maurier wrote this novel as a fictionalized history of her own forebears. As best I can tell, the famous author is a descendant of Robert Busson, who added the ""du Maurier"" to the end of his name as part of his aristocratic pretensions. The Bussons were a two generation family of glass blowers in France, who were master craftsmen, but no aristocrats. Simply stated, Robert was a gambler, a risk taker who threw everything into his quest for prestige. He spent time in prison because of bad debts, emigrated to England to escape his creditors, and abandoned his children from two marriages. When the side he supported failed, he merely turned his coat. All of this took place in the era of the French Revolution, and while the book contains scenes of local riots and insurrections, of starvation and murder, The Glassblowers lacks the tension so characteristic of Rebecca and some of her other fine works."
3,Not as wide as photo,"The pan wasn't as wide as the photos. I have another Tfal and I uploaded the comparison. The new one has 40% smaller cooking area and is 30% taller. Not what I expected, not good for 2 eggs as I had hoped.Photo is misleading, wait for my images to get approved.I haven't cooked with it yet."
2,it died,we liked the item while it lasted but it didn't for very long. we don't have kids playing with it. it's just my husband using it. it quit after about a month...
5,Zaptastic!,"Oh man. I love these things! We live in a buggy place--right next door to a wetland (you can read about it here if you want: [...] ), which is a nice way of saying 'swamp.' We spray down with repellent, have an outdoor zapper, use outdoor fogger. Still flying bitey things! When we are sitting around outdoors, everyone gets a Racquet Zapper (we bought 3). They make getting attacked by swarm-ey infestatious biting yuck bugs fun! Make a game of it!"
1,Another reason why I'm poor,I bought the zapper and AA batteries at Walmart. Sigh... I'm so disappointed. Flies want to land on the edges of it or other areas that wont kill them. Then I tried swinging it around like you do a tennis racket and it makes the flies fly away. I probably got more laughs from my family than bugs killed. Yes another ploy to take poor people's money without them realizing. :(
1,did not work,The product did not work. the light lit up as if it had power but did nothing to any sort of insect
3,saving Winston,received movie in a timely fashion. Movie was ok have seen better ones. Was wrapped well and would do business with again
1,Not worth the time,"I don't think this movie deserves even one star, but I'm going to go ahead and give it one for effort. We watch a lot of faith-based films, many of which are distributed by PureFlix, and we've liked most of them. However, we stopped this movie after only 20 minutes due to extreme boredom. The dialogue is very slow and seems forced. The acting is rigid and many of the actors, even adults, look like they're performing in a high school play. The background noise is distracting--it sounds like it's being filmed on the shore of an ocean with waves crashing in and seagulls playing. It seriously detracts from the quiet country setting of the movie. The soundtrack is nothing but annoying piano music, if I recall correctly. Don't waste your money buying this film--check it out from your library instead!"
2,Two stars for photography and music.,"I read the reviews on this film and agree with the ones who stated it was a good story, but dialogue fell flat. It seems like a pattern with some christian based films. A great story becomes mediocre when dialogue is not good and the characters not too believable. I too felt the aunt seemed depressed and gee, who would want to be like her? The horse seemed more like a prop to insert when needed. I enjoy family films as much as anyone, but can't really recommend this one unless you don't mind a sketchy story. I give it two stars. One for the photography, and one for the beautiful music."
3,overall not bad,It arrived in perfect condition and shipped fast. You can tell the movie is a lower budget film but it has a good message! It was good for it's price.
1,Great Potential,"I thought this movie had great potential. However, the dialog was blatantly inauthentic and lacked any emotion. The plot was unreal and the acting was horrible. The horse was not even abandoned. Lady in movie ""The family just signed over the horse today for placement."" All in all, the movie is verrrry slow. I would not recommend it even if you love horses."
2,We didn't like it!,"To quote my seven year old grand daughter who loves the chincoteague ponies and has enjoyed the book series - ""It was all about trying to force the ponies into a trailer"".My review: It was someone's home movie and not a very good one."
2,Not your average crime profiler,"I bought this book thinking I would gain some insight into what makes criminals kill and how I could profile my next door neighbor.Instead, I got some drivel about ancestry and the Darwinian theory of evolution on the brain and how it's prewired from prehistoric times.I found it confusing and redundant. Most of the book was written in the style of a clinical psychologists thesis, not for the average true crime or non-fiction enthusiast.Read at your own discretion, but don't say I didn't tell you so."
2,"Not Very Interesting, Not Well-Written","The author seems to assume that because of his own murderous ideas, that everyone else is the same as himself.He starts off with a terrible assumption, and expands upon it endlessly."
4,What Am I Getting Myself Into?,"Understand what this little book is and its significance. Barthes begins with a short story by Balzac and then plays with its interpretation. He ""rereads"" the story using different treatments. His goal: to show that there is no Author who gives an Absolute Meaning to the text -- that it's the reader who provides his/her own meaning to it. The Author is dead, long live the Reader. You may or may not get this concept, but trust me, it's a significant shift in literary theory. I've taken the time to write all this in hopes you don't read it the way I did the first time, wondering ""What in heck is this?"""
4,Old school review,"This is an album that will take you back. If you are a big fan, you'll enjoy this. Babyface and LA Reid did a great job with this."
5,Kerastase. Hairdressers love it!,It's the greatest for curly hair. Keeps them soft and wavy. You don't have a lot of the shampoo for maximum results.
3,Good product but.....,"Karastase has always been my best brand of shampoo but It didn't come with a pump at the top. Which is really stupid, how am I gonna use the shampoo without having the pump???"
4,"Excellent shampoo for thin, wavy hair",I am over age 50 and not apt to swoon just because a shampoo lathers well and smells nice. This shampoo really brings out my wavy hair and leaves it very manageable. It cleans well but isn't high in detergents so it doesn't harm my color-treated hair. I like this brand a lot.
5,Queen Bee Supply rocks!,I received excellent customer service from the company that I purchased the shampoo from- excellent quality shampoo that retains moisture in curly hair without weighing it down. Pairs great with their Oleo Intense Curl Conditioner.
1,Bottle came with lot #'s and NOT FOR RESALE burned off,"I bought a product that I expected to be a retail item, not something that someone had taken a soldering iron to..there were two deep burns on the bottle where the lot number and a 'not for resale' marking had been partially removed by using a sharp, hot, tool to burn partially through the plastic, but the markings were still legible.I somehow think that this compromises the integrity of the bottle itself.When I returned it because I considered BURNS on the plastic bottle as as defect, Amazon refunded me less than half of what I paid."
3,Not for me,"This was recommended to me by my hairdresser. He used it on me in the salon. I happen to have dream hair, long, thick, wavy, a lot of it. I just live in the desert and need hydration. After using this product ONE time at home, I could not believe the amount of hair loss I was having... in the shower, on my brush, throughout the day. It freaked me out. This went on for one week. I didn't immediately think it was the shampoo since this didn't happen at the salon and I used it twice at home. Once I discontinued using it, the hair loss stopped, thank goodness. I'm aware that it's great for others, just not for me."
5,Encyclopedia of Film...kinda,"Great introduction to some of the greatest films,documentaries,etc ever produced on DVD, bar none. Not all will appeal to one viewer but the collection represents an interesting cross section of film from around the world as well as providing wonderful extras in the process. If there's a title you're not interested in, sell it or giveit as a gift . Please STL, bleflambeur@hotmail.com. Cheers."
3,no robocop!?!,"I was about to order this set but then I found out it did not include robocop.. I was FURIOUS!!! screw that, what a rip off."
5,What a collection!,"I review (and own) a lot of Criterion DVDs, and I personally feel that most Criterion discs are of better quality (in terms of the movie, extras, scholarly content, etc.) than the discs from more mainstream companies. Look over the titles in this MEGA-HUGE collection, and you'll find many of the greatest films ever made.Still, $5K is a waaay-outta here price for most consumers except crazy film buffs (like me) who are also extremely wealthy (not me, sigh). And of course, your postal delivery person won't be too happy at you for ordering this and breaking his/her back. But, the value ($17.7 per disc, 282 in all, or $20.7 per title, 241 in all) is quite good for Criterion discs.If you have cash to burn, this is a solid value. Keep the films you like and auction off the few you don't."
3,"Cool yes, but wait...","There's no arguing that this is a great collection, but by the end of 2005 HD-DVD will be on the scene. I am an avid film buff and have many Criterion releases, but ultimately I want everything in HD format.All the studios recognize this, and will ultimately re-package and re-sell every title in HD (I don't think the timing of George Lucas releasing the original Star Wars Trilogy on DVD now was an accident).To drop 5K now seems a bit premature. Plus, many films in this collection are old film to tape transfers meant for laserdisc so were mastered to D2 (a composite format.)"
4,Good Fun,"Spoiler Alert! The good guys win!I enjoyed this book even if it had touches of deja vu about it. It reminded me very much of the ""Destroyermen"" series I've been reading recently but, instead of US sailors read a US Civil War regiment; instead of Furry Meerkats, read Mediaeval Russians; instead of bloodcurdling all-devouring lizzards read man-eating ten-foot aliens armed with bows and arrows and roaming like a Mongol hoard.The Americans unselfishly fight for freedom and inspire the Russian peasants. They rapidly industrialise the land and fight a battle to end all battles. Stirring derring-do tales of heroism and self-sacrifice... If only real people - especially Americans - were like that... but it's fiction."
4,A rousing adventure,"The whole concept here is pretty wack, but once you accept the premise, you're in for a pretty rousing action-adventure novel with some fun scenes, good battle action, and a pretty exciting climax. This one's not going to win the Nobel prize for literature, but it will keep you entertained and it will make you want to read the rest of the series."
4,"4.5 Stars Good, Fun Reading","An interesting concept. I read this book in four days. I immediately went out and acquired the second and third books in the series. Similar to an alternate history, but on another planet with a unique ruling class/civilization. It will be interesting to see if their history is uncovered to show what brought them to the state that they are in.Although not entirely believable, It is a good action book. Plenty of battle sequences. Lots of detail on strategy and movement. Hardly any wishy washy content at all."
2,Minority View (The Lost Regiment on Gilligan's Island),"Sorry, I guess I don't see what others saw in this book to rate it so highly.It just went on and on, cycling through the same basic story line. I can't even imagine how boring future episodes will be.It was really quite fortunate that there were so many members of the regiment who had such specific and valuable skills. Perhaps future adventures will introduce the farm boy who has dabbled in brain surgery on his cow and now has to do it to the Colonel."
3,"Good Story, But Overrated & Predictable .....","I am by no means a dedicated reader, but I have found myself polishing off about 2 books a week for the last month. So, having read 6 consecutive David Gemmell novels, I thought to give myself a change of pace by reading this highly rated book.What a disappointment. Yes the story idea is very good, but the character degvelopment left much to be desired. Dozens of pages go on & on with the sole purpose of showing the writer's knowledge of 1860's history & Civil War facts. Nothing was added to the story by this; and it was very boring (I could care less how a grain mill worked in 1865). I will not give away the ending, but anyone with even a little imagination could see it coming 2/3 of the way thru the book. If you are a Civil War fan, you most likely will enjoy the book with many of it's historical facts & technical details."
1,Absolute PIece of Junk,The plastic cap flew off the first time I started my weed eater. It is just a square head bolt pressed into a plastic knob. There is not anything to hold it together. Absolutely not a replacement part as described. Best advice I can give is to look elsewhere and don't loose your money.
1,Poor,"This new bump head busted after only a couple uses. Not sure if it's the overall design being poor or what, but I wasn't vey happy with it."
5,Tremendous talent.,Something about Eric Matthew's music is very therapeutic. I own his entire catalog and never get tired of listening to his music. Great singing from a great artist!
4,Detailed Maritime Narrative but lacking emotion,"Perhaps because this was my first novel by Patrick O'Brian and it was written after many earlier novels with the same characters I may be have missed some detail about the two main characters, Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, which reading earlier works may have revealed. I found both characters to be rather sterile. However, as a maritime historical novel, O'Brian's command of meticulous sailing detail was hugely impressive. Furthermore his knowledge of what was known about the flora and fauna circa 1800 was worth reading this novel alone for. (It is not surprising that O'Brian has written a biography of Sir Joseph Banks). Particularly interesting was his account of life in Botany Bay at this time. I also found O'Brian's references to the Irish Question very interesting. Overall I enjoyed the historical detail in this novel rather than the characters in it. I for one would be quite happy had the male water mole (platypus) been more deadly!"
5,love these books,"I love all the Patrick O'Brian novels, the whole series, what is it 23 books? They are great adventure, fabulous characters, based on real historic naval battles. I really like how they portray male friendships as loyal and kind, in the midst of scary battles and espionage in the era of Napoleon. My only complaint is that O'Brian died before finishing the series..."
5,"Action packed, entertaining continuation!","Circumstances surrounding the 'Nutmeg' - her creation, her voyage, her meeting with the 'Surprise' and all of the small stories around it are wonderful. Sad conditions in the Australia colony (the eastern coast) makes me relieved that my family settled the west and the south. Fascinating and entertaining peek at history."
3,O'Brian fan,Great service as always. Books are attractive and seem well constructed but the printing and editing leaves something to be desired.
4,Why are you reading this series??,"Did you ever listen to Tim Pigott-Smith do these in the audiobook format? I cannot read these ever again as he elevates the experience of these lusty sea-ditties to new heights! He brings them alive with a fabulous array of dialects, voices, genders, etc. From Aubrey's gusty command voice to Maturin's Irish whine to Killick's gutter-snipe cockney it's a whirlwind of adventure on the high seas. And..if you need to know... the Nutmeg is a risen-from-the-ocean-floor Dutch merchantman that's fitted out with enough firepower to attempt to take on (through devious Aubrey machinations) a French Man-o-War and there's a reunion with the Surprise!! Keep em' coming and sail the blue with Mr. Smith every time! ""Bare-away"", Mr Killick, ""Bare-away""."
3,Reproduction Of Original,"First I would like to say that I think ""Coup d' Etat"" is one of the Plasmatics best albums. Now for the bad news. There are several reproductions out there and the CD I bought was a Caroline Label and for some reason before they put this on the market they did not bother to listen to it first. They left out track 5, which is ""No Class"" and repeated the 4th track ""Lightning Breaks"", which is a great song, but does not deserve to be repeated. Wendy's cover of Motorhead's ""No Class"" is a great song and deserves to be heard. The track ""Uniformed Guards"" is totally missing from this reproduction too. The lesson here is to purchase Plasmatics merchandise released by ""Plasmatics Media"" then you are gauranteed to get an authentic high quality reproduction. Always Check Album/CD Label before purchasing. I recommend this album as a must for fans, just not a reproduction by Caroline Studio."
3,Oh no! It's NOT a PUNK album!,"Just a counterpoint to the people opposing change in the name of punk rock: while this album is certainly not Beyond The Valley of 1984, it's pretty far from junk. So it's metal. It's well-composed, political metal. There are a few duds, but for the most part, the Plasmatics rock and Wendy O screams her guts out no matter what the tempo."
3,Mediocre,"I read this book simply because it was set in Gulfport, MS. It didn't hold my interest too well, but then again I'm not a marine enthusiast. The author was very knowledgeable about marine issues, and I learned a few new words or terms. The minute the killer's character was introduced in the book, I knew immediately that was the killer. The premise for the solution was completely improbable and not believable. However, the author developed the characters fairly well."
3,Some people die quick.,"I enjoyed the descriptions of the boats and the island, but some of the sea descriptions were like filler in a good story."
3,Some people die quick,"Reasonable story, a bit unlikely, stunningly bad writing - averaged about one absolute howler per two pages, must have been edited by a third grader!"
4,some people die quick,Some people die quick more people would rate stuff if all this was not REQUIRED. I hate being told what to do
4,Good book,"I enjoyed this book, but I did not like it as well as book one. (Blood on the Vine) I'm not quite sure why, maybe because the crime that Jay Leicester was initially hired to investigate was so horrific, (I found it almost unbelievable), and the motive for the crime did not seem adequate to explain all the subsequent happenings. There are several murders in this book, and they are described with more detail than I like.However, the author writes very well, and mostly keeps the story moving, although there were a few times that it seemed bogged down with details, but I still managed to finish it in a day and a half. The main characters were well developed and believable.I think that the fact that I liked book one better, really is about personal preference and that many readers will enjoy this book just as much as the first book in the series.The book was nicely formatted and easy to read on my Kindle."
2,Where is the 'why?' David?,"As I plodded through this story that seemed to go nowhere I was struck by the question why? why is all this stuff happening? I was looking for why a character has a dead soul which inhabits him from time to time, or why anything in this book happened other than to move the story along. I got to the end and I felt like I had just read a bunch of words, with no real meaning behind it. Having enjoyed works by Feist, Tolkien, Pratchett, Goodkind, Jordan and others, this was far below their best or even worst efforts. This opinion is of this work only, and is the only work of Drake's I have read so maybe his other works are better. That is not for me to judge, but my opinion of this book is what I have written."
3,An un-engrossing offering,"Although Drake fills the last 450 pages of this work with good action and magic sequences, the book itself is generally uninteresting and does not capture the reader. Jordan's Eye of the World showed the wonders of Randland, both current and ancient, and intimated a sense of palpable evil. Tolkien conveys a more spiritual shadow. In both works, the evil is there and felt -- not some nebulous concept discussed in the natterings of an ancient sorcerer without any real manifestations of it -- the Hooded One (and his machinations) is neither seen nor ""felt."" For these reasons, I won't buy the series."
2,Bout' Average,"I guess the book is OK. It is not one of the greatest fantasy novels I have read but I am choking it down. I think that the 2 page chapters and the constant switching back and forth between characters on seperate islands gets a little old. I mean, the hermit and Sharina are running for their lives from a bunch a bugs...switch to a sheepherder chating with his family...switch to Sharina running into a building...switch to herding sheep...switch back and forth and so on....AAARG!. Can't he just write to a nice transition point before changing the thought? Anyways, as far as the book goes...If you already bought it then read it, Otherwise find your entertainment elsewhere."
2,Who're they kidding?,"When I pick up a book and see such stellar reviews from outstanding authors quoted on the cover, my expectations become quite high. Can I get my money back? Not only is this book hugely disapointing and cheesy, I'm going to have to read another, and another, and maybe another, just to get the full story (or not!). This is another chaotic fantasy with no rules, boring characters, and pages full of mellow-drama. Not to mention totally unoriginal. This is the kind of stuff that gives fantasy a bad name. Where are the Bloodguard when you need them?"
1,I did not enjoying this book.,"I had just finished ""A Crown of Thorns"" by Robert Jordan when I picked up this book. How unfortunate they cannot compare. Mr. Drake bounces back and forth between characters too much. I found I was unable to develop any interest in them or what they were doing because suddenly that chapter would end and we would be off to another character. The story line develped way to slow and just didn't pull me in. The characters changed in ways that were not clear. I'm going to go back and read my ""Wheel of Time"" series again or maybe ""LOTR""."
4,Not Jordan or Eddings but almost !,"I certainly enjoyed reading this book and the sequel very much. The further along I read, the better the story seemed to get. I would not rate the story up with the best I've read, but I would put it on the tier just below. I am glad I didn't miss the chance to read this book. I would highly recommend reading this novel."
1,Crap!,"Don't buy this book! It's crap!!! Poor writing, and confusing terms that are very different from those used to fantasy. Imagine, his 'lich' is nothing more than a common zombie. His 'demons' are just something like giants or goblins. Every mage in the book is described as powerful, but ignorant in their use of power. People grouped together for no apparent motive. Boring!!!"
2,Stimluates the mind but not any empathy,"For the most part, I agree with previous comments made on the characters being pathetically flat. Liane seems to have absolutely no purpose but to meander about. The main point I have to make is that no one is the slightest bit curious. Garric takes anything and everything Tenoctris says as the simple fact and never questions. Magic seems to be convenient to plot. There are no rules and no consistancy. One moment Tenoctris can't do a thing without some type of twig, next thing we know she is taking Garric to another dimension without having to chant as previously required. These could all be accepted if someone would simply question. Does Garric, some sort of scholar as a child, hold absolutely no curiosity? Furthermore, it seems that Mr Drake wrote the last twenty pages, and then wrote backwards to get his charcter there. I understand Mr Drake is an excellent Sci-Fi author, but I believe his concepts of fantasy do need sharpening."
1,How many primary characters? Doesn't hold interest!!,"These are the first David Drake books that I've attempted to read. I've read Tolkien, Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, and George R.R. Martin but Drake's Lord of the Isles shouldn't even be categorized with these others. He lacks the ability to really involve us in the story with excitement and anticipation. I found there were too many characters introduced too quickly. I trudged my way to page 200 because by then I thought my interest would be peaked, but to no avail. I have no problem giving his books a one star. If you want a good read try Jordan, Goodkind, or Martin...Ben in Nova Scotia"
5,Great,Great start to captivating story. Each character is well thought out and written with their own flaws that show that sometimes teamwork and working for a common goal is the best path.
4,"Good entertainment, could use more depth...","I truly enjoyed this detailed fantasy series. Drake has painstakingly created a world; however, this world has no innate originality - I won't remember the map and the peoples afterwards. Morever, the constant changes between ""planes"" are confusing. Which plane is which? Are some of the characters on the *same* plane? The threat of evil is not as all-encompassing as the evil latent in some fantasy worlds, and the characters seem to glide through their tasks with the greatest of ease. Demons are conquered, kingdoms are captured, traps are avoided, which is all well and good for some iced cake reading. On the upside, though the characters and their tasks are not very complex, they're fun to root for. To sum it up, this is a very enjoyable book, but I wouldn't buy it."
2,Poor book,"Not really much to say in favor of the book. The book skips around too much for my likng with the 2-4 page chapters. Contrary to the quotes on the cover, their is very little character devolepment and the magic system is like what you would find in a pre-teen book. In 625 pages, the book goes half the length of better, smaller books I have read. Not much of a vocabulary. Also the battles usually take only a page to describe and go through, if even that much. There is a very detached point of view throughout the entire book. Unless you are desperate, don't waste your money on this book."
2,Not So Good; Sluggish,"I found this one quite sluggish. The first quarter of the book moved along sort of so-so, but the middle is a stall and now that I am in the last 60 pages, I find myself forcably trying to stay focused. It seems to run on and I'm looking for the direction the author is going in. Not a very good read folks. Stick with the greats; Eddings, Brooks, Goodkind, Harrison, Jordon, Elliott, Martin...--these authors have outstanding worlds soooo worth the explore!!"
2,*shudder*,"Wow. This is the book I would have written back in high school. Hyperbolic, shallow, all the characters painfully one-dimensional. I kept hoping Drake would settle into something better, and stop using the inane analogies over and over. I mean, if I had a dime for every time he compared something to ""back in Barca's Hamlet"", I'd have enough to go buy a better written novel. For kicks I actually read the sequel to see if it was an improvement. Nope. In fact, I think once he'd run out of introducing us to and attempting to develop the characters, all that was left was to have them deal with one predictable and clichéed scenario after another. It wasn't until I finished both and moved onto Robin Hobb's excellent ""Assassin"" series that I realized how painful these two Drake books were.Maybe he's an acquired taste, but I gave him two books to try and win me over and all I got was a sigh of relief once I'd finished."
2,Flat characters,"I picked up this book, a hardcover, in the bargain bin for four bucks or so. The map inside the cover was interesting. An archipelago world, hmmm, possibility of lots of naval action here, I thought. I have to say that I have not finished the book. I can state that the storyline and historical background had fantastic possibilities in my mind. But the flat characters just aren't able to pull it off. They seem dull, lacking emotion, and just don't seem to be developed in a way that they could have been. I found that I had no sense of identifying with them. It seemed like I could care less what happened to them. Whether that changes in the later stages of the book, I don't know, but it was such drudgery getting there that I had to stop. I don't like posting a bad review, but this is my opinion and can be taken or left."
2,"So So book, but if you miss it, don't lose any sleep.",I have to admit that I was pretty disappointed with Lord Of The Isles. It took a long time to get anywhere and it seemed very light on the details. It felt like reading a summary of another book with most of the details left out. The author seems to jump around alot and never really fleshed out the current scene before leaving it. I would recommend skipping this one.
3,Fantasy Fan,"Unfortunately this book has one important element missing, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. Although the plot is interesting enough, Drake tells us nothing about his characters. They question nothing that they observe around them. Each character is like a brick wall with no emotions or feelings. Drake makes it near to impossible to relate to the characters.Besides for its one major flaw, Lord of the Isles has an interesting an magic packed plot. It is obvious that lots of work went into creating a complex magical system.All in all i recommend toughing out the first boring chaperts. Then by the end of the book if you aren't interested give up."
2,Not so interesting,"The characters are not well developed, and the writing style is often unclear, making me re-read to understand what he was trying to say. The whole story is loosely knitted together, so it reads more like a series of short stories based on the few characters. On the whole, I was very disappointed, especially after so many praises heaped on this book on the cover!"
5,Epic hero's in a not quite epic setting..still a great read!,"Tired of spineless hero's whining ""why me?"" or worried about actually using some of the ""awesome powers"" they control because they're afraid to hurt somebody. Then come read a really good book filled with real hero's. Strong Male and Female characters stride through the story with clearly understood purpose and ability lending the needed suspension of disbelief necessary to propel the book to near epic status. I definitely enjoyed this book, it had an Andre Nortonesque quality that I haven't seen done well in quite some time. Bravo to David Drake!"
1,Wouldn't finish this book if I was stranded on an isle...,"This is the second worst book I have ever read in my life, and has won a place on my not-finished-and-never-will-shelf. The chapters are too short, and the story jumps back and forth like a rabbit with borderline tourettes. The characters (Garric especially) are 1-dimensional, and so lame I wish I could've just reached into the page and slapped them silly. This book belongs in the feather-weight category alongside Jone's 'The Baker's Boy'. Editors if you are reading this, PLEASE, PLEASE stop publishing this tripe. Think of our depleting rainforests."
4,Not Epic . . . but entertaining,"It could be epic, though it needs a little work. There aren't too many books out there, though, that are as engaging and entertaining as King of the Isles. Interesting main characters, tight plot, detailed setting, fast pace. I couldn't put it down and I'm now reading Queen of Demons. I just hope the Robert Jordan syndrome doesn't affect Drake and we get 10 more books with nothing resolved. He is published by Tor, afterall."
2,This book is disjointed and ultimately annoying.,"Many subjects were just brushed over. For example, the sister is plucked out of the home and life she's known for 18 or so years, and nobody bats an eye! Her brother never even sits on a log and thinks ""Wow! this is weird"", and she never even flinches when everything she has believed about her life is turned upside down. Also, the overall story always felt sketched, but never filled out - I don't mean it needed more words, just some better focus. It was a letdown after all of the praise printed on the cover. Even the action was boring because most of the time it came from nowhere, with no build up."
4,A story with the potential of an epic.,"While not as rich and engrossing as other fantasy worlds, David Eddings has done an impressive job creating and filling something entirely new. The story does start slowly, and at times I had to force myself to keep turning the pages, but eventually I found myself totally absorbed by the material and characters. Lord of the Isles is a good read. Not great, but eventually worth the time. I'm looking forward to the sequel."
1,"When your brain says ""That's it, I'm outta here."".....","Let me preface this by saying that I REALLY don't like fantasy stories where thousands of years pass, and the land stays basically the same (i.e. the horrible Redemption of Althalus). So what do I find in the first few chapters of this book? We find the wizardress Tenoctris awakened after hundreds of years in some sort of magic-hibernation adrift at sea. Is she upset when she awakens? NO! Is she angered? NO! Does she feel anything at all? NO! Does it take her a long time to acclimate herself to her new time? NO! After shouting ""FEEL SOMETHING....ANYTHING..."" out loud, and throwing the book across the room, I decided I wasn't going to be reading the rest of the trilogy."
5,References to Jordan,"Hehe, not much of a review really, but I thought it was really funny that it had such similarities to Wheel of Time, since from what I cotton Drake and most of the Baen guys abhor Jordan, think his writing is just drivel (I'll admit, I don't need to know QUITE so much about the ins and outs of hundreds of miles of eventless marching :D). In Ringo's ""Princess of Wands"" a thinly disguised version of Drake sells his soul to (a) devil and kills a whole con festival full of fans because he's P*ssed off that WOT sells so well when his own fantasy (presumably this series) only goes over moderately. It's actually quite funny. I wouldn't think he'd want any similarities to ole Robert."
5,nobody noticed the cat,I have read this story over and over and will continue to do so and I am 80 years old. I like most of Anne McCaffrey's books and I rate this one of her best.
4,Mag-niffy-cent!,"A feline lover's dream! Of course no one noticed the cat, unless Niffy wished to be noticed! Ah the hero here is a daring one, and quite brave for any creature, on four paws or two feet. Yes the fluffy one is the centerpiece and weaves her way through the book showing up at crucial moments to steal the show. McCaffery injects her story with all the essence of the feline, who acts and feels like a real, live breathing cat, a special one of course, but many authors attempt to bring character to an animal but somehow it becomes just a shadow of what one really is, a lack of understanding perhaps, but McCaffery understands the nuances and quirks of feline culture and therefore makes this a delightful read for those that love fantasy and cats. The ending is also perfect justice and while this is just a short little book, that should have been more, it was great while it lasted."
3,early Anne,I liked this book. It was imaginative and kept my interest. I could never figure out if it was a historical setting or a futuristic setting. I finally decided that was one of the things I liked about it.
3,good read for younger readers,"Obviously written early in her career and aimed at younger readers. It has a good plot, is easy to read and if you like cats, princes and some humour then try this. I enjoyed it even if i am much much older than the target market"
3,Just OK,"I am a huge Anne McCaffrey fan but this book was a little disappointing for me. It was a cute story, no doubt about that, but it seemed more like something a child would write. It was too short, seemed to drag in parts and had a very predictable happy ending. It's not worth 6 bucks. If you can get it for 50 cents or a dollar then buy it because it is a cute story and a fun premise."
3,lodwalney,"Ok, but really a novella rather than a novel. Could be a good present for kids to help get them into reading."
4,"An entertaining, quick read.","I was at first doubtful when I received this as a gift. But took it along to read on a flight and throughly enjoyed the book. McCaffery again shows her versatility of subject matter, writing another great short story."
4,good little book,"I love everything by this author, and this was no exception. I was a little disappointed with the story about the twins, however. It was a great story, but felt a bit 'knocked out'. It could have been fleshed out much more than it was with the rich detail Ms. McCaffrey is so well known for. Still, I enjoyed the book and stories and still would buy it. The detail in the illustrations are great. It's a good 'gift book.'"
5,Leann meets a past star and learns a shocking secret.,Leann Rimes and Tom Carter write a fascinating novel which is sure to please anyone who reads it.
4,a bit confusing/boring but great!,"holiday in your heart has the perfect title for what it's about. this books really touches your heart, but it can be a little confusing at the end, and the beginning is a bit boring. but stick around for the whole books and you'll definitely be rewarded!"
5,Capo,my 12yo is able to attach this capo alone. Her other capo which claps on would take both of us.
2,Where's the beef?,I found this book - a few interesting bits heavily padded with material intended to provide color but which failed to engage my interest - to be the literary equivalent of a hamburger sandwich that is long of bun and short of beef.
2,I'm sure the author could have done better,"While I don't doubt the author's credentials as a special forces operator and small arms expert, it seems to me that he has taken too many fictional liberties in an attempt to make the book more readable. In the book he tells one (not quite believeable) story of how he killed the nazi war criminal Ortgies, while on the tv documentary about his exploits a completely different version is told. This could have been a major exposé in the tradition of ""Spycatcher"" and ""By Way of Deception"", but unfortunately the book is written like a cheap spy novel. However, if the author had found a good ghost writer, I'm sure the book would have been an international bestseller like the two above mentioned books."
4,Amazing portrait of life in the Ming court,"I had to read a number of works on late imperial China for a project, and this was by far the most enjoyable, and one of the most illuminating. A group portrait of life in the court of the Wanli emperor, it provides an indelible image of reformers struggling, always in vain, against a tottering, corrupt political bureaucracy that thwarted them at every turn. Huang made me feel like I was peering over the courtiers' shoulders as the imperial system, which had lasted for so many centuries, finally collapsed.The only reason not to give it five stars is that, in organizing each chapter around a single person, Huang necessarily crossed the same ground a number of times, which made the book seem, here and there, a bit repetitious. But this is a fine piece of work, always interesting and often enthralling. I've never read another book like it."
2,I slogged through half of this book and,"then I decided I didn't want to go on any longer. Page after page about political shenanigans. That might have been okay, but the book doesn't even tell you much about what life in China was like at that time. The behavior of the government officials during that time at that place were pretty much like what goes on today in governments or any bureaucracy for that matter. If anything, the book shows that it's pretty much the same story no matter where or when. What a stifling position it was to be an emperor at that time - a life of obligatory ritual after ritual. At any rate, my main criticism is that I feel I learned precious little about China, much less the China of the Ming dynasty."
5,Norpro KRONA 1.5 Quart Vented Sauce Pan,"I purchased this pan because of the great reviews.After receiving it I couldn't agree more, it's a very nice pan and lid.Perfect."
3,Not for induction,"Seems like it would be a very useful pot, but will not work with an induction cooktop."
5,easy pour spouts,This pan is lightweight but durable. I love that it has two spouts for easy pouring as well as for left or right handed users. The handle also stays cool to the touch.
5,1.5 Quart Stainless Sauce Pan,"I absolutely love this little sauce pan! Over the years I have 'gone through' several of these size pans with varying degrees of satisfaction, but this pan is my favorite so far. It is so easy to hold and cleans up beautifully--haven't had any problem with food burning or sticking, either. I definitely would recommend this sauce pan."
2,Just not very good Jerky,"I was not pleased with the taste of this jerky. It was nothing more than another cheap, dry, ultra tough, and poor tasting jerky that isn't even very spicy. It's also loaded with MSG if that's a concern for you. I bought a whole box and wound up throwing away the last two packages since they sat around opened for so long as we just couldn't force ourselves to eat anymore of it. This just isn't good jerky."
3,Vick's review for Amazon.,"I like to watch the person singing, rather than listening to the artist on the CD The DVD was done in good taste. It showed alot of action with Elvis singing. A picture is worth a thousands words. I loved the DVD"
3,younger audience,"I'm a big fan of the .hack franchise, and this book (along with the ""Legend of the Twilight"" series) were among my least favorite, perhaps because they targeted a much younger audience. Big fans will still want it because it includes a description of ""The One Sin,"" an event frequently referred to elsewhere in the series; and if you're younger, it's not a bad starting point to get into the franchise.Casual fans might want to skip this, though, and go straight for the second ""AI Buster"" book, which is a collection of short stories. (This is a single long story.)Note that this is NOT manga, it is a text story."
4,One year later...,"So one year later and this backpack has certainly held up. Rolls great, seams & stitching have held together just fine. The only thing is, the retractable handle gets stuck ever so often. Great product!"
4,Adequate and sturdy,"I am very happy with this purchase. It has plenty of space and compartments, and seems sturdier than products costing 1.5x to 2x in brick and mortar stores (Office Depot etc)"
4,OK for now...but!,"The product arrived on time. It is exactly what my middle school son wanted and needed for school. He has a very small locker at school so his last back pack was extremely heavy with all his books needed for each class. This roller/back pack has been a blessing for him...but, after only one week one of the screws in the handle came loose and would not tighten, I had to super glue it to stay tight...not sure what else may break over time so my review at this time is 4 stars and could change with time. If the screw holds and nothing else breaks during the year it will be well worth the $26 spent and deserving of 5 stars...we'll see!"
1,ebags customer service is NOT GOOD,"We have purchased this bag from Ebags, the maker is CalPak.The 1st month our child used the backpack, it got broken. I did ask for a replacement and both companies did not agree on which one had to replace it.That happened in March, I have sent the photos.....ebags says that we are out of warranty, CalPak says to send a piece of the bag with a 14 $ check so they can reimburse us a $25 bag.Since we do not feel we are been treated fairly we are going to write negative reviews on both amazon and yelp.We have even offered to purchase a more expensive, $80 bag, so ebags had to ONLY give us the credit towards the new purchase. Did not do the work for them. We ended up loosing the bag and the $25 we paid for it!If you want to be selling your products online, speed up your processes and CUSTOMER is ALWAYS RIGHT!"
1,Beware - poor quality product with no manufacturer support,"This bag was for my 9 year old son to use during his 3rd grade school year. After two months, the bottle holder broke. One month later, the full lower bottom support broke off. A couple of weeks later the zipper gave up. One month before his school year was over, the handle broke off. I contacted the manufacturer and after providing photos of all side and broken items, they decided it was not covered by the warranty. Make your call and decide if this product is for you...... it is defiantly the worst backpack I ever purchased."
3,Just barely making it through the school year,"It's a trade-off between price and quality...I am hoping this makes it through one school year. The screw that holds the handle to the bag came loose in the first two months of use and had to be retightened each day until we came up with a permanent fix for it. Now the base where the wheels are is starting to loosen. So, quality is a con. The pro side of it is it is a good size bag, able to hold a large 2"" zippered binder holder and a small one inch binder, a large 4x8 lunchbag, a large textbook and a hardcover library book in the main compartment. In the side mesh pouch we can pop an umbrella and in the front pockets there is room for a snack, a paperback and a few other small things (when the main bag is full of the other items I have mentioned.) Bottom line is I love the price, the size and the convenience of wheels, but the quality is questionable."
1,Poor Quality: Lasted only 3 months,"Do not buy this bag. It is a waste of money and will fall apart shortly after purchase. Warranty? Go look it up.. they make it more of a hassle than it is worth. You need to call, drive to the post office to mail it to them, pay them 10 dollars ""processing"" fee, and then you must spend a ton of time to argue with them on the phone. They know they can make money selling a poor quality product. Most people will not make them replace it.NEVER BUY A CALPAK"
1,Poor quality backpack disintegrated after 3 months of use,"We ordered backpack on August 11, 2011 to be used by my 7th-grader son. He started using it in the beginning of September and after only three months of use the backpack is in full disrepair: the handle fell off, one of the straps ripped, so it is impossible to reattach it, the bottom plastic pieces disconnected, so the backpack is mostly unusable.I am very disappointed with the quality of this backpack and would like to receive my money back: the product is very poorly designed and and poor quality as well - my expectation for a backpack is to last at least a school year."
5,great for the price,"I bought this bag to help save my back from nursing school, lugging around a ton of books is starting to take its toll. This is a great bag, I can easily fit 5 texts books with some notebooks and supplies. I have only been using it for a few weeks,but it seems sturdy, plus it has a hard bottom, so it doesnt sag under the weight of the books. My only problem with that bag is that the color was a little brighter than I was expecting, so if you dont want a flamingo pink bag, maybe choose a different color"
2,Not worth the money!,"I bought this wheeled backpack for my 7th grader. Looked to be sturdy from pictures. After using it for just carrying his school books and folders, the handle broke within the first month! He has only used it for 2 months and I am now looking for a NEW backpack. This one fell apart! Literally! Guess $40 wasn't enough for a middle school backpack...."
1,Poor Warranty after 3 months of use,"I purchased the Awestruck backpack for my daughter. After only 3 months, the bottom wheel support cracked in half. I paid $26.99 and now CalPaks wants $14.95 to process my warranty claim !! The backpack has a 3 year warranty so what good is it if they will not replace the item for free. I submitted pictures of the backpack by email and then they wanted my to cut an 8"" x 11"" piece of material from the backpack to sent it in along with $14.95. Really??? You would be better off purchasing a different brand."
1,Already tearing,"I bought this product for my 2nd grader, the bag seems durable and rolls well, but the handle already jams and will not go all the way down. Also the mesh net holder on the outside for bottled water has already torn. He has used it about 6 weeks at school.Okay we are now in our last 2 months of the school year and I had to order a new backpack. The screw came out of one of the poles that connects to the handle. It falls down inside the pole, like over time the hole wears to big. I put it back like 5 times then finally threw the backpack in the trash! Such a waste of money!!"
4,nice backpack,My son has loved this backpack. We have had it about a month with no problems. Good backpack for the price. Wish the outside pocket were a little larger.
4,Very interesting,"This was most definitely a very informative DVD on the subject of burlesque. The women in it started out as knowing very little about this form of dancing, which ultimately is getting undressed in a very sophisticated manner as opposed to basic striptease, even though with striptease, sometimes this can apply also. The clothes are what make Burlesque fascinating and in this DVD, we see ordinary women changing from working attire to the most conderful costumes to perform in, and performing at the end of the DVD in a professional way. These women are from all walks of life, and have not done Burlesque before, therefore at the end of the DVD to see them doing so is quite a revelation."
4,Nothing but marvelous,"This film is a surprise jewel of a find: beautiful cinematography, music, performers. It's sexy and touching at the same time. It will appeal to every red-blooded, hetero man for the sheer sensuality of it all. It will reach women in places they didn't know existed or were afraid to acknowledge. It's real; it's intelligent; it's liberating; it's fun. Well written, directed, and edited. A marvelous date film."
4,"A rare book, lovingly and beautifully written.","This is one of those rare treasures that anyone who has ever studied piano will enjoy immensely. It is a quiet story of a sweet little old lady who teaches piano in a town in Arkansas, and the week of the Guild Auditions, when a tornado touches down and changes her life for the second time. Imbragulio is insightful and writes with love, clarity and delicious turns of phrase. You cannot but be touched by Miss Etta. I certainly was."
5,the best cook book i own!!!(and i have quite the collection),"Great cookbook, the begining starts with basic foods you may want to keep on hand which are cheap and easy to find. several really great recipes for sauce, and even a pizza crust with no yeast."
2,Sunbeam Bread Pan,"This product does NOT fit a Sunbeam Bread Maker, Model 5891. It is much too small, does not fit in the bread maker and does not use the paddle from the old bread pan. It may fit the Oster model 5891, but does not work on the Sunbeam."
1,Leaks grease on bread/dough,"Do not purchase this replacement pan as it will start leaking black grease on bread after using it for 6-8 months. I purchased this replacement pan about a year and a half ago. Six month or so of regular use (about twice a week) I noticed black grease getting mixed in with my dough. I threw that pan away thinking it was a fluke and probably a rare defective one and decided to purchase another pan. Sure enough about 6-8 months later same thing happened. This time when I took the dough out (for pizza), I noticed grease on the bottom of the dough and pan.Needless to say I will be throwing out the Oster bread-maker and will be purchasing something else soon.PS: I noticed that someone else has reviewed this item and mentioned the leakage problem."
1,Does not fit my model,"I purchased this bread pan because the information stated it fit my Oster model but it did not fit. My Oster bread machine is model 5838. While it is a good price for the replacement, by the time I pay return shipping, it only costs me money for their incorrect listing. We have all been waiting for fresh bread--now we wait longer---:(!"
3,Not too bad,"We are ordering this pan every 18 mounts. The Oster machine (from Sunbeam)is just good, but the pan last only 18 mounts. Average using - 3 times of week. It start leaking from the seal. Also they make it thinner and thinner, and the Teflon cover start to peal off after the 3-rd mount beside we are very careful whit it.The last one that we ordered still missing. I guess the USPS did not do good job. So at this time no pan no money!!! UPDATE - I have received refund."
1,"May be a great pan for one model, but not for mine","Be forewarned: when I ordered this in April 2011, Seneca River Trading's product information on Amazon stated that it fits seven different bread machine models, including mine (5833). This is just plain inaccurate and misleading. Alas, within five minutes of attempting to fit it into my machine, a part broke off that renders it unusable. Today in looking at Seneca River's website I was surprised to see there that this pan works with model #5891, not seven different models! Time will tell how the return goes, but I hope and trust they'll be gracious about it since it is their mistake in posting inaccurate information on Amazon."
1,Bread Pab,"Nice pan, but it is NOT compatible with my machine... as was stated in the description. But I sent it back and received a credit card refund... so all was not lost."
4,Good product,The bread pan is identical to the original and it fits and functions very good. I would recommend this product.
1,Didn't fit,"Even tho' we looked up the bread maker and found the part #, it did not fit. We ended up buying an Oster bread maker from Bed Bath and Beyond."
1,WRONG - NOT FOR 5891 SUNBEAM,Sunbeam bread machine model number 5891: although it claims to be the correct pan it is NOT. It doesn't even fit into the bread machine. It cost $7.90 to return the pan. I wish Amazon would fix the incorrect information on the website so that others don't have the same problem.I agree with many other reviews.
4,Very Good Replacement,"This pan was a very good replacement for my 10+ year old breadmaker. The only reason I did not give it a full 5 stars is because we had to bend the metal clips slightly on our breadmaker to make the pan seat properly. Once we did that, it is a good fit and has already baked several loaves of bread. The Teflon coating is very good-the loaf just falls right out clean!"
5,Great book,"I want to thank Mr. Monastirsky for a great book. Both me and my husband read it.I have most of the digestive issues that Mr. Monastyrsky describes in his book.And I have had them since I was 13 years old and I am 25 now. I just started following his diet about 4 month ago and see great results.And before that I have tried almost everything out there for heartburn, ulcers, constipation .... And all I could get out of the doctors is:""We don't know why you are in pain, go see a surgeon "". But none of them has mentioned what I should eat or recommended the proper diet. Everybody kept saying drink 8 glasses of water and take fiber. Well, I am sorry that does not work. So far the only thing that helps is following Mr. Monastyrsky advice.I highly recommend everybody who has digestive issues read his book !Thank you"
2,Read carefully under doctor's supervision,"Please note that the author also markets his own line of foods/supplements. That should always put you on guard. It contains some very opinionated viewpoints. I had the opposite experience from this book. I suffered from Diverticulitis (with infections) for seven years. I continued to experience problems until I added more fiber to my diet, specifically 1 tsp. powdered psyllium once per day. Once I added fiber, my diverticulitis flare-ups stopped. So I caution readers to please discuss the findings of this book with their doctor."
2,Inaccurate and contraditory,"I purchased the kindle addition of this book based on the tumbs up review posted on the WAPF website and curiosity.I have to say that it was a highly disapointing purchase. I'm not all of the way through it yet but I've read enough to write this review. His (Atkins Goes to South Beach) chapter is terrible. My own research plus personal experience has taught me enough to know that his calculations (what it takes to lose fat) are completely (oviously) inaccurate. You don't need a ""no carb"", low protein, low fat diet to lose fat.That isn't the only strike against this book.His comment that bacteria cannot survive the acidity of the human stomach would render probiotic therapy useless, which it is not.This is just the tip of the misinfomation iceberg, in this book. Don't waste your money."
1,Confusing mess of information,"I was okay with the theory in this book for the first few chapters but as this book went along I began to wonder what the author thought any of us should eat. Fiber and carbs were obviously bad but then the author went on to criticize every other diet out there with no clear explanation as to what was wrong with them. I suppose we can eat air. I have no idea if this book gets on a coherent thought. I stopped reading after the first few chapters.This book also continues the myth that Dr. Atkins of the ""Atkins Diet Plan"" died of a heartattack. He did not. He slipped on ice and the resulting head injury was fatal. His alleged weight gain was due to the steriods he was given to reduce brain swelling. Don't believe me but do look up the facts. No diet should be denigrated because the author of it happens to die. No matter what any of us eat or in what ratio, we will all die eventually."
3,Helpful explanations but tries to sell product,"After some ""issues,"" I found this book's explanations helpful. However, I kept waiting to get to the part about what supplements would be helpful, but the entire book simply led to the website where the author is trying to sell his supplement/products. Frustrating to say the least. I had already bought the book; I should at least be able to either buy those or buy what I want locally. I do now understand the role of fiber and water in proper digestion which is important in my life at least."
3,A question,"I just read the Kindle version of the book.How many grams of fiber are ok to have daily if I am not to aim upwards of 30 grams?I'm 47 and never ate much fiber to begin with but recently I have started eating more (approx 20 grams daily). Am I doing myself harm by this? Surely people have been eating all the fruits and vegetables for thousands of years, no?"
4,Fiber Menace Refuted The Conventional Wisdom,"This book contradicted the ""conventional wisdom"" about fiber and water-intake that I had been living under for more than 20 years. The science was laid out in terms that an educated layman could easily grasp, and the refutation of ""conventional wisdom"" was set forth in a way that was logically inescapable.I am a hard guy to persuade, but I took the findings of Mr. Monastyrky to heart, and changed my fiber and water intake as he recommended, and within a day or two, my body was functioning better than it had in 20 years.It was like trying to run a race with lead shoes, and discoverying again what it was like to run, when you got rid of them.Mr. Monastyrsky's recommendations and reasons will in time replace the misinformation and misdiagnosis about fiber and its supposed benefits that have caused us so much grief. Readers of this book will congratulate themselves that they were years ahead of the curve."
2,A little over the top,"This author presents an extreme opinion that is, at the least, without balance in his presentation. There are issues that are food for thought-- good ideas-- but his lopsided approach is not for me."
2,Fiber Menace,"The author is proposing a low fiber diet to help all digestive disorders.However,he did not provide enough evidence to convince me that the low fiber diet is a healthy way to live."
3,Comfortable and stylish,"I found these shoes true to size and width. They are very comfortable for loafers, and have proven to remain comfortable even during those long 12-14 hour days walking on concrete floors. These shoes look great with jeans or casual wear. The one point that left me less than satisfied with my purchase is the durability of the leather. I expected something slightly more rugged and durable. rather I found that after only a couple weeks of wear, the color of the toes have already started to fade."
4,"astrology, the star connection",I bought this book for my son. He is very interested in Kabbalah and astrology. He says it is a very good book. He enjoyed it very much.
2,Not High Quality,"After receiving the Sony U655, I was so disappointed with its range and sound quality I obtained a Motorola 280 to compare. I didn't know if the poor quality was the Sony or all FRS 2-way radios. The Sony transmission was broken-up even at close range. The Motorola was nice and clear. I need a radio that I can use while paddling in my kayak, so hands free is important. I visited the Sony web site and called their customer service to try to obtain information on any hands free accessory. Sony has a separate mic and ear plug, but it is not voice activated. The Motorola has Voice Activation capabilities. I will be returning the Sony tomorrow. Sony does not appear to be seriously in the FRS 2-way radio business at the present time."
4,Exact what I needed,"This rack is exactly what you need if you have an apartment with limited space and a fairly high ceiling. I put my two mountain bikes on it, and haven't experienced any problems at all. And it's super easy to assemble. It might appear to be flimsy compared to other more expensive brands, but it does what it's supposed to do. Good product."
4,Easy to Assemble and works as advertised,The product arrived as advertised. Assembled easily and performs the function as intended. I need more space in our garage and the only way to go was up. I fits perfectly between the garage doors.
3,Satisfied customer...,"Once installed it held bikes okay, but a little flimsy. I like the system because it doesn't have to lean against wall."
2,"Nice, but it conked out after 2 months","I got it for a very cheap price after looking online. It worked quite well, according to its descriptions and many of the reviews, but only for a couple months. Then it conked out -- the light is always flashing no matter what, and it makes no sound when the mailbox is opened. It seems that the reliability across units varies quite a bit."
4,I Always Know When the Box is Full,"Sometimes you buy something and use it and think, ""wow, why didn't I get one of these before?"" I honestly put this little device in my top ten purchases list. It's so simple but makes my life easier because I don't have to guess when the mail has come. I was concerned because the unit has to transmit through shrubs and trees at an angle to where the receiver is located in my house, but it works every time. My only complaint is that the double sided tape used to attach it to the mailbox came unstuck in the heat of summer. I've since rigged up a cradle and epoxied it to my mailbox, but I wonder if there is a better double-sided tape that can stand up to the heat."
5,I love the show and this book!,"I love the Design on a Dime show, but I've been annoyed when I can't get enough detailed information as I watch the show. This book solves that problem for me. Instead of just repeating what's been on TV, the book digs in and pulls out more ideas than I was able to see when their video cameras panned the rooms. It's so good to be able to stop and look carefully at every angle of a room makeover in this book. The book also includes detailed how-to-do-it information that I can't get on the show. Great book. I love it. Thank you HGTV!"
2,Not very useful and poorly put together,"This book was not at all what I expected. I have NO desire to use burlap as a window treatment. In additon, the photography is very poor. The colors are washed out and the windows are just bright white. I would not have bought this book if I could have seen it before hand. I do not recommend this book."
2,Another disappointment,"This book was just as bad as their other book - 6 Steps to Design on a Dime. The cover on this one looked so elegant that I thought I would love it. This one has some extremely ridiculous projects. I mean really - very juvenile. There is nothing ""high style"" about floor pillow made from old pants. Plaid pants at that! Aack!I can see why these are no longer in print."
2,Pretty disappointing,"I am a big fan of the tv show so I was expecting more from this book than it delivered. There are some helpful hints, but I would have really liked a lot more examples from the show and inspirational room pictures."
1,"DATED, DATED, DATED!!!!",I so regret for not checking the date of this one! I don't even think it's worth giving away. Didn't like ANYTHING in this book ;(
4,Decent decorating book,"I've looked at many, many home decorating books lately. This is the only book where the basic house and furniture looks like the mix-matched hand-me-down stuff I have. Going on a shopping trip to France for antique furniture is just not an option for me. I appreciated the everyday practical approach to design and decorating. Some of the designs are not my style but I found a lot of inspiration. I do wish the book was a little more detailed in the before and after pictures."
3,A few useful ideas,"After watching the show, I eagerly grabbed the book. Flipping past the designers' bios, I gazed in dismay at the uninspiring photos. Somehow the rooms look less on paper. Less high style, less creative, less appealing...Maybe seeing the dismal ""before"" room on TV, and watching the team transform it, grabs the viewer. On paper, it is too static with the views too limited to excite.Still there are some useful do-it-yourself projects such as making a padded storage cube. The room arranging kit, consisting of graph paper and some furniture shapes to cut out and arrange is pretty ho-hum."
5,Messmer Forest Fruit Tea,"Delicious. I first had this tea in Italy. The inn was so nice, they game me a dozen bags to bring home with me. I haven't been able to find it since. I ration what I have because it's such a treat. It really is like drinking a mug of hot berries."
3,Beyond the Mat Ringside Special Edition,"This DVD is the same as the rest of the Beyond the Mat DVD's. I thought this was going to be a new Beyond the Mat with different scenes in the movie. If you already have any of the Beyond the Mat movies, do not buy this one. I hope they make a NEW Beyond the Mat that has different scenes. I think that Beyond the Mat movies are awesome, but I get tired of seeing the same thing in everyone of them.Thanks."
4,One Good Documentary,"This is great movie for any wrestling fan. It is mostly based on the older generation of wrestlers and the turns the business has taken. It mostly follows the careers of Terry Funk, Mick Foley, and Jake The Snake Roberts. It really has nothing to do with the new wrestling generation, there is virtually nothing on Triple H, The Rock, or Stone Cold Steve Austin, except for a few cameos, so if you were thinking of buying this movie to see any of todays stars, i don't recommend it, but this movie is for the truly hardcore wrestling fans."
4,Everything you always wanted to know and more.,"A very moving documentary on the subject of wrestling. Actually a very good one to watch ESPICALLY for the non-wrestling fan. I am a huge fan and almost cried during the Jake ""The Snake"" segments. Overall make sure you see it one way or another."
3,Beyond the Mat,Very insightful to the lives of wrestlers and their families. I would recomend it to wrestling and MMA fans.
4,A GREAT EXPLANATION OF THE UPS AND DOWNS OF THE BUSINESS,"THIS DOCUMENTARY FOCUSES ON TERRY FUNK, AN OVER 50 YEAR OLD WRESTLER WITH HEALTH PROBLEMS THAT CONTIUNES TO WRESTLE IN SPITE OF WHAT HIS DOCTORS TELL HIM. AND IT FOCUSES ON FORMER WWE WRESTLER JAKE ''THE SNAKE'' ROBERTS, WHO IS NOW ANOTHER OLD WRESTLER HIMSELF WHOSE DOWNFALL WAS CAUSED BY A REAL SERIOUS COCAINE HABIT. AND LASTLY, ON MICK FOLEY, WHO GOT HURT ALL THE TIME AND WANTS TO QUIT TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH HIS FAMILY. THIS IS A REAL GOOD DOCUMENTARY THAT TELLS WHAT NORMALLY HAPPENS TO A WRESTLER ONCE HE GETS PAST HIS PRIME. THIS IS THE REALIST WRESTLING DOCUMENTARY EVER MADE. AND I WILL BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND ANOTHER DOCUMENTARY THAT'S BETTER THAN THIS. WE COULD REALLY USE A SEQUEL! ALL WRESTLING FANS, GET THIS NOW!!!!!"
5,A great film,"Beyond The Mat is a brilliant exploration into the lives of proffesional wrestlers. From in front of the camera and thousands of screaming fans to behind the scenes, this documentary follows wrestlers such as Terry Funk, Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts, Mick Foley, and New Jack. This is a fascinating look into what goes on within the wrestlers families and backstage. Also recommended: Bret Hart, Wrestling With Shadows. Both are must-haves for any wrestling fans video collection."
5,The best movie I have ever seen!,"If you like wrestling, I mean really like wrestling, this is the greatest movie that you could ever see. Mankind gives an intimate look into the private life of a family coping with the violent reality of the mat life. Terry Funk gives his daughter away at her wedding and goes to the doctor who can't believe that Terry can still walk. New Jack tries his hand at acting in Hollywood and becomes a close friend of the director of the movie. Jake the snake smokes crack and meets his father and daughter for the first time in years. This movie picks up where the show leaves off and details every aspect of the world of pro wrestling."
5,Great insight! Get this now and be entertained.,"Beyond the Mat was an awsome movie! There was great and very interesting insight into how the lives of pro wrestlers are affected by the sport. By mixing great facts and off beat humor this film is entertaining for wrestling fans and non-wrestling fans as well. The way that the life of Jake the snake Roberts is shown is very intreaging. This film lets the viewer see how the wrestlers' families are affected by the violence in the matches (Mick Foley, with his wife and kids). The movie shows the hardships of wrestlers who are not in WWF and wcw. Beyond the Mat enables you to see a behind the scenes look of their favorite wrestlers without ruining their in ring personalitys too much. This DVD should be great with the extra features."
5,"""The Real World "" W.W.F. style.","I have been a fan of wrestling and the WWF since the early eighties and in all that time, in all those years of hero worship; I never once stoped to consider ""Who are these men, realy?"" If you ever wanted to know, this is the DVD for you. You will NEVER look at wrestling the same. The comentaries are all good, but my favorite is Mick Folies,his is both touching and funny. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE A FAN OF PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING TO APPRICATE THIS MOVIE!This graphic drama is not for the faint of heart, but I beleave even people who are not fans will be moved by Jake Roberts amitted battle with several addictions and Mick Foilies strugle to balance family and his profession. I will be haunted by images from this film forever."
2,Should Say Pictures of 50 Years of Jewelry,This is a nicely presented collection but that is all it is--it is sadly lacking if you are looking for a book that gives you information. There's a decent glossary at the end but basically it's just photo groupings of someone's jewelry collection. (Good news for me is the copy I bought is basically unused but I only paid a few dollars for it as used). If you want to learn about fashion jewelry there are better books.
2,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed I spent the money on this book. All the price references are in the back, which means taking more time to find them when doing research. I rarely use it."
1,spot welds,"I bought this as a gift for my husband. The second time he used it the spot welds on the handle broke dropping a very hot lid.It should have been everything that he wanted. But, instead it is a safety hazard."
2,"Just one good song ""Ca Plane Pour Moi""","See that cover with that annoying looking man decked out in red all over the place? Whatever you would expect from such a cover is how this sounds. This is silly, silly euro trash pop music.However, ""Ca Plane Pou Moi"" is a fantastic song! I don't know if it is great because it is, in fact, a high quality song or if it just invokes fun nostalgia from the early 80's.Either way, just get the mp3 for this sterotypical sounding , reved up, very new wave sounding tune, hyper-kinetically sung in French"
3,"not a rocker, not very entertaining. Just a seat.",This rocker never rocks. My boy is 4 months old and only has started using it now. Still has a hard time rocking it on his own. I have to do it for him and that is not why i got this item. He used to hate it as its very boring. I have seen better rockers. I would not spend $50 on this item.
4,Wonderful rocker,"I love this rocker so much that it is the item I always buy for baby showers. We have the older model that doesn't fold, which is why I bought this one. It really has lived up to the name of infant to toddler rocker. We gave it another name, poop chair. For many months as soon as my daughter's little baby bottom hit this thing she would poop. Have no idea what magical properties created that but it does lead to the one draw back. It is hard to clean. I ran it through the washing machine and line dried it but it is still not that easy. Other than that we still love it 22 months later!"
2,so so,"I got this as a gift at my baby shower ( bought from my baby registry)My 2 month old son seems to like the vibration feature.It's not his fav chair though, he prefers the swing. He stays in this chair for 5 minutes max before he yells to get out.The music in this is POOR, VERY VERY POOR!!!! It sounds like cheap crap and I am disappointed cause I had really expected more.It is the same quality that you will hear from a musical card when you open it. I think they were trying to play twinkle twinkle little star but the notes were off in some areas.The rainforest swing on the other hand sounds very good.I will NOT recommend, sorry."
1,DANGER!!!!!,My son is fairly active and when I sat him in this chair he reached forward to his feet. If I had not been close he would have crashed onto his head. I called fischer=price and they blew me off. If anyone's kid gets hurt because of this VERY dangerous product I will be happy to testify!
1,"Very dissapointed, you cannot rock that thing at all and more...","Like I said in my title, rocking movement is extremely limited. I have one of these wire bouncers and they're way better than this. The other thing is the attachment with toys. Who ever designed that, didn't have the slightest idea what he/she was doing. To take that thing off requires a substantial amount of force, but you have to be careful and not to brake that snapping plastic. Now, when you take this thing finally off and when you put it back on, it makes very loud noise snapping in place, that it scares the babe."
5,"The Baby loves it, so do we.","It is a great invention. We love the vibrating motor which rocks and calms the little one down. It is durable, light in weight and gives you a free hand without having the baby crying."
5,Great Rocker!!,"My 6 months old son loves this rocker! The adjustable reclining positions are great as well as attached musical toys. It's sturdy and well-made. Overall, it's a great rocker--I recommend it."
4,This really helps...,"On the up side, Got this for my three month old and was really pleased with the vibrant colors. Also my son loves the vibrations and enjoys sitting in it just staring at the brilliantly colored dangling toys. He is now reaching for them, so it definitely aids his development. I can actually place him in this and do short chores around the house because it keeps him occupied.On the down side, I wish there were more than one tune for him to listen to when he pulls on the musical toy. Also, the tune is a bit too short. What would also be great for his age is if the rocker could rock on its own without any effort from baby, since my son is so small i have to sit with him and rock him for comfort. I guess when he is older he should be able to rock on his own. Otherwise, i'm happy with my buy."
3,Rocker is fine but didn't help me,"I bought the rocker specifically to help my 8 month old daughter nap in the daytime. She's not much of a napper, so when she napped at a friends house in the previous version of the rocker I immediately wanted to get one.The rocker is very nice, and I don't think it will tip like the previous version is reported to do, but my daughter also doesn't sleep in it. So much for magic solutions. But she will sit in it for a little while and play with the toys, so it's not a total loss."
3,too much of a good thing ?,"While the blending of orange blossom and jasmine is luscious, this fragrance is a bit heavy for me. Perhaps I erred in buying the eau de parfum and should have purchased the eau de toilette. I've read that about three-fourths of eau de parfum is lost after several hours. That's not been my experience with Carolina Herrera. In fact, the aroma is still in the crook of my elbows until I wash it off, and it's as if I had just applied it. For many that may be a major attribute.However, my preference is for a much lighter scent - sort of a ""barely there."" While this fragrance is lovely, I wouldn't recommend wearing it to a concert or any place where you'll be in close quarters with others who may not want to enjoy your wonderful aroma.If your plans are for an evening in some secluded spot with a special someone - enjoy!"
2,Carolina Herrera,I bought this for my wife. She has been using this brand for about 20 years. We were excited to get this at such a great price. The very first time she used it she asked me what I thought. There is something different about it. I don't know if it is a knock off or maybe it wasn't stored properly. It could be real old - who knows but there is something different about it. We both noticed it. Now if you have never used this you should be plenty happy with it as you don't have anything to go by. The difference is so slight that I'm sure many people would not notice.
3,"not what I ordered, but Amazon was very helpful :)","I was so excited when UPS delivered my package today! I thought $47.14 was a great price for a CAROLINA HERRERA For Women By CAROLINA HERRERA Eau de Parfum Spray in 3.4 oz size, as posted in Amazon. I just opened the box and it is NOT Eau de PARFUM, but Eau de TOILETTE! Geesh! I was so disappointed!!! Eau de toilette dissipates much faster; Eau de Parfum stays on your skin much longer. Needless to say, I must return :(In going through the return process, I contacted Amazon Chat, and the lady was very helpful - for which I rate Amazon 5 STARS!"
4,Nice Normal Smelling Perfume,"To me this perfume smells strongly of baby powder, with just a hint of flowers. It's a pretty good perfume. Once applied it smells quite nice. But there is nothing particularly unique or different about the fragrance. But that's okay - it doesn't have too. It it's normal, everyday scent. I would definitely recommend it."
1,Please replace the product,yo recibi un correo en donde mi courrier dice que la colonia llego rota y que los contacten para el cambio del producto. Adicionalmente me enviaron un correo desde miami soportando lo que estoy indicando.
3,a little too quiet,"I purchased this item to provide a relaxing environment in a waiting room. The videos, taken of different American sunrises, appear to have been shot with a fixed camera, over several minutes to capture the emerging dawn. At the beginning of the shots, it's rather dark, and in many of those, there is no wildlife movement, or they are so far away that it is like watching a still photograph for minutes. Only natural sounds are recorded, which at times are very quiet; in a busy room it is not very readily heard. The DVD is as advertised, (nice sunrises, nature sounds) just not quite what I was looking for."
2,Make sure you intend to get an HD DVD!,"This is the now-defunct HD format of DVD, if I am not mistaken--don't buy it if you expect it to play like a regular DVD. You have to have an HD player, and those are dinosaurs now. I got taken that way and I wish the listing was more clear."
5,A before-breakfast treat,"This is a set of 3 DVDs, each with 3 high-quality, relaxing 52 minute videos. Each video is of one general location (but with several different views of that location) starting before sunrise and continuing until the day has gotten started.The locations are widely varied, such as near the ocean, in Yellowstone national park, the New England countryside, and several coastal areas. City views? Forget it. These videos are all very much out in nature. Not the view out your own windows, or even from the windows of a vacation cabin.Sometimes the videos include wildlife. Always lots of relaxing natural sounds too. These are great peaceful videos for those of us who rise later in the morning and don't get out away from town often enough. There are occasional small and unnecessary subtitles to help you figure out what is happening. They do not detract from these very nice videos."
4,Sunrise Earth DVD,"This DVD set has three DVD's and nine episodes of Sunrise Earth in various locations in the United States. The picture is excellent considering this is a standard definition DVD. It's probably the best standard definition DVD I have ever seen. The content is very good too.The reason I give this only four stars is some of the programs have very annoying parts which detract from the enjoyment. For instance, the ""Vermont Balloons"" episode is a beautiful looking and sounding episode, until you are close-up and hear the blast of the heated air going into the balloon. Also there are two other episode with scenic water views and nature sounds, until a boat rolls by. I think they should have edited out those parts and kept it to just nature.Nevertheless, I still recommend this product."
3,Enjoyable,"First, you will obviously not have the same sharp HD Quality you currently enjoy watching this series on the HD Channel on your TV. Regardless, it is still fun to relax and enjoy the scenery of each locale. I mostly watch these while stretching or doing yoga in my living room. The funny thing was I had a really hard time watching them during the evening. After all they are ""sunrises"". I would have enjoyed more global sunrises like many that I have watched on the TV series. As the title says ""American Sunrises"" so you don't get to witness more exotic locations which I have readily enjoyed since I travel very little. I hope they come out with a more exotic location series (more even than the ""Beach Sunrise"" series currently available contains)."
5,Relaxing & beautiful !,"This is what I remmember seeing on Animal Planet several years ago very, very early in tha morning. Don't expect music or a commentary. It is all nature sounds of the actual sites. So relaxing. A mini vacation when you can't get away."
2,Origami Hearts,In the interest of including numerous projects the author seems to have chosen to take shortcuts in the direction department. The photos are beautiful but the diagrams are terribly confusing to a novice. It would make a great coffetable book as long as no one asks if you have completed any of the projects unless you are already an expert folder. Better detailed diagrams with written instructions would make this a much better book.
3,Not bad for the price,"This isn't a great pot, but for the price, it isn't horrible, either. On the good side, it has nice handles on the sides and lid. It has a good thick heavy bottom that heats evenly. On the bad, the lid does not fit well, there are large gaps between it and the sides of the pot, and the supposed ""straining"" feature is rudimentary at best. If you are looking for an everyday ""beat-it-up and not worry about it"" pot, then this one is for you."
2,Krona 3 Qt Pot,"One thing that isn't noted in the product information is that the pot is MADE IN CHINA. Had I known I would not have purchased it, and will not purchase any further cookware by NORPRO USA."
3,Fact or Fiction?,"That's what's examined here. There is evidence a real life grail Jesus drank from in The Last Supper survived history, I bought one online. My ancestor's built Stonehenge, it's still there. A Druid is simply a priest of a specific denomination. Knights in metal plate armour are shown here, even though it was little protection against even a single might as well be wooden sword or sharp dagger, let alone a spear or horse lance even in a joust. So the knights got a reputation for being brave wearing plate armour to defend their kings. Full plate armour with helmets and shields appeared in Europe about the year 400 A.D., and much the same recipe is used to make today's metal armour, though it is much better right here right now in plain clothes."
5,outstanding romance from a favorite author,"Suzanne is my kind of gal! She can ride and shoot like a man, while still retaining her finishing-school polish. I liked her for her absolute devotion to her friend, an Arapaho, and her commitment to that friendship. She meets her match in Black Jack Sloan, an outlaw out for revenge. Realistic battle action paired with heartwarming romance make this the perfect winter read."
5,The Most Wonderful Tea,I received this tea in a house-warming basket and it is wonderful. I could (and have) drink it all day. I was so glad to find it on amazon but I think next time I will go straight through eurogrocer and save a couple of bucks. But it is worth it!
5,"""STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN""","This is WW11's most creative propaganda film. The combination of performance, heartfelt romantic plot, interesting characters, and beautiful film style make this a piece that will stay revelent for years to come."
5,Magical,The beautiful images from this movie has haunted my thoughts ever since I saw it some 20 years ago. I have been searching for this movie ever since then. Re-release this movie soon!
5,Heavenly Goring!!!,"David Niven (Peter Carter) and Kim Hunter (June) are excellent as the newly met wartime couple struggling to preserve their love against the ""law of the universe"", the law of heaven. But is the conflict real or all in Peter's mind? Should he be dead???Although the script itself is witty, poignant, and expertly crafted, in my opinion a great deal of the charm of this movie comes from Marius Goring's supporting role as ""Conductor 71"". Just over the top enough to keep the movie buoyant, the character is a terrific balance to the seriousness of the subject and the setting. He brings a sense of timeless romance to the story. If you have the opportunity, buy a copy of the limited print book of the movie, which subtexts a great deal of the story."
5,"Please, please! release this film.","I saw this film more than 30 years ago on television and it has stayed in my memory more than many films I saw just last year. What a gem! I have also seen the Warren Beatty remake, and it is good, but does not compare to the original. Please release this film on video. I know it would be a success. David Niven has zillions of fans (well deserved) is always a classy guy, and never more so than in this masterpiece. I loved it!"
1,Beware [REGION 2] It won't work on your player if you're in USA,I suppose the product is ok if you have a player that is required in order to play Region 2 DVD's. I'm disappointed that I can't see the movie and that Amazon does not warn you of this in their description.
5,"Haunting...Can affect your concept of ""heaven.""",This movie has enchanted me for 45 yrs. I want it in my possession to play over and over. Please let it go....!!!
4,Good Soundtrack marred by bonus track,"This was one of my first cassettes as a child, so nostalgia got the better of me. Listening to the bits of dialog interspersed throughout this soundtrack put a smile on my face!This Stephen Marcussen remaster sounds quite good, but I deduct one star from what should be a five star review because of the bonus track, a 1991 ""remix"" that doesn't flow with the rest of this title."
4,Almost Awesome Soundtrack...,Actual movie clips along with the music throughout the CD. It is like listening to the movie broken down to about a half hour. Different variations of Flash's Theme keep it from being overly repetitive and increases the intensity of the song each time. Only thing that keeps this from a 5 star review to me is the final track remix is absolutely terrible. Really a shame it was even included. Enjoy the rest though. Must have if you like the movie.
2,Not really essential to a collection,"I love Queen, but I could have done without this album. It's just a collection of recordings for the ""Flash Gordon"" movie (which is great,by the way, if you like cheesy over the top early 80's sci-fi). I love the theme song, but a lot of this is very synth-based and filler, and could have been done a lot better. I think that Queen should have stayed away from this one. Still though, the larger-than-life musical style of Queen fits if you actually watch the movie. Otherwise, don't bother with this one."
2,Absolute bottom rung of Queen's career...,"Queen has reached an all-time low with the CD Flash Gordon. Of course, there are many people who didn't like Hot Space (Queen's 1980s disco music), but this album is so far afield of their previous work that it didn't even sound like them in the remotest. I would not buy this album unless you are a strong supporter (like me) of Queen's work or a collector."
2,on a loop,"Warning! This CD is for die-hard Queen fans only. I bought this cd for my uncle's birthday, he is the aforementioned die-hard fan, and he loves the cd. But as I listened to it I couldn't help thinking that the CD player was on the 'repeat track' setting. Almost every song has is either the main theme remixed or the main theme hidden among dialogue. Why not a one star rating? Well, I just couldn't do that to Queen."
1,Not very good,"Even though I am a big Queen fan, I must say that this is album is total waste of money unless you want to collect everything queen ever made. With the exception of the opening song, 'Flashes Theme', the CD sucks. I am not disappointed in Queen, I understand that every musical group has their share of ups and downs; this album is a small blemish on the otherwise brillant and incredible history of an awesome band."
2,Queen? Are we sure?,"Now Queen has a good sound, but this soundtrack doesn't show that at all. In fact there is only one song on this album, the theme to Flash Gordon, which is played 18 times on this album and the song isn't that complex, so it grows old real fast. The only difference between songs is that there is movie clips laid down over the music. It is almost like the movie has been put on cd. And the music doesn't sound like Queen, it has this wacky electronic sound to it. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the Flash Gordon remix (the Final track) isn't that bad, in fact it is sort of funny. Whoever mix it seemed like they had fun doing it. Besides that I would suggest staying away from this soundtrack, if you want a good Queen soundtrack, pick up the Highlander soundtrack!!"
4,If you don't like this you SUCK!,"Some people don't like Queen or the Flash Gordon movie. I love both,this soundtrack definately brings back the whole experience of watching this picture in the the theater when I was""younger"". And execpt for one annoying track tagged on at the end. This is an excellent soundtrack. Buy it and listen to it on a Saturday afternoon."
3,Flashing Synthesizers Throughout the Mix,"With two numbers geared to FM radio play - Flash's Theme and its reprise, The Hero - the remaining 16 numbers on this February 1981 release were synthesizer-laden instrumentals with snippets of movie dialogue in the mix.The single - Flash, which is titled Flash's Theme on the album - stalled at #42 on the Billboard single's chart, with the soundtrack achieving a tepid gold sales status while peaking at #23 on the album chart.A platform for a superstar band that could afford to step outside the realm of heavy rotation on the radio and the familiar terrain of its classic sound, the soundtrack is interesting, but hardly an essential piece of Queen's amazing discography."
2,Find it all pretty satisfactory...,"This is probably a mistake reviewing this record, but I am something of a completist so here it goes. `Flash Gordon' is a movie soundtrack, nothing more and nothing less and not particularly memorable. ""Flash's Theme"" is great for this record and ""The Hero"" is the best song and surprisingly heavy as compared with the rest of the album which is heavily syth laden. The movie can be enjoyable is watched in the right frame of mind, which is to enjoy it as a live action comic book with all the cheesiness that this implies. Only for fans of the film or for Queen fans who have to have it all (like me) but others stay away."
4,Fun for Queen fans,"If you're not a Queen fan, don't start with this album. If your're looking for goofy fun and a great album to drive to you could do worse. I would like to call your attention to to one track and other than the title song, the only other song with lyrics. The Hero is a hard driving metal extravaganza. One of Queen's hardest songs and often overlooked because it's on a sound track. But like Highlander, who of us doesn't get a few goosebumps when the credits roll and we see ""Music by QUEEN"" Enjoy being a kid again."
3,Interesting...,"This isn't really the type of album I would put on to listen to attentively -- it's more like something I'd put on while I work or do something else. The album follows the movie and most of the tracks contain dialog from it. If you're a huge Queen fan, get it, but if you're a new fan or a casual fan, I'd skip this one, at least until you've gotten some of their other albums."
5,"See the movie, THEN buy the CD","There are a lot of people that put down this record, but if you have seen the movie, you know differently. Regardless of whether or not you cared for the movie, you have to admit this music goes along PERFECTLY with it, which is what a soundtrack is supposed to acomplish. I can still remember watching this movie as a kid and being wowed by those synths and power chords. It is a musical journey from start to finish, and a great album from one of the greatest bands ever. Rent or buy the movie, and then you'll want this too."
2,"If I Wanted Dialogue Over The Music, I'd Watch The Movie","Don't get me wrong, I like when soundtracks/scores include memorable dialogue on them, but it should be separated from the music. I bought this expecting to hear the music from the film, but the dialogue is actually played OVER the music!!!! It is like watching the movie with a blindfold on!!!!Maybe one day, Queen will release a music-only soundtrack."
5,Samsung 170mp,"I upgraded from a flat screen 17 inch CRT to the 170 mp, and now it's a better world, at least for a computer user. The screen is big, bright, and very easy on the eyes.Pros are: Easy set up, even the slightly awkwark connections on the back; tons of available desk space now; easy to use with the TV and the PIP; very sharp picture and wide viewing angles; the speakers are pretty good; easy to motor around in the on screen menus; and the styling is impressive.Cons are: The full screen TV is just a touch grainy, and I can't adjust it out (this may be my cable connection though); the remote IR has a very narrow projection cone, it has to be aimed almost directly at the IR sensor on the monitor, but this is easy to get used to; it's a bit pricey but then you're getting much more than a monitor, with built in TV (and PIP), and inputs for all kinds of stuff.All in all, if you're looking for a multifunction 17 inch TFT, this is the one."
2,Not a very good TV alternative,"Got this for a college dorm room.Unpacked it and hooked it up to my cable system. I immediately noticed that when you looked at a moving image, it would be blurry until the image stopped. Say for instance a person was walking accross the screen, the person would be slightly blurred while he/she was in motion. When the person stopped moving, the image would be much better.Brought it back."
4,recommendation,"I like this product because I have other Samsung product that performs very well, and moreso because it has both NTSC and PALsystems meaning I can use this everywhere."
4,Blurred text at 1024x768?,"I would say this LCD monitor is not the one with the coolest look. The silver plastic even looks a little [flimsy] when you look closer. But no other monitor at the same price range beats its functionalities: a high-quality monitor and a full-functional TV at the same time. It has every input method you need: A/V, S-video, RF, and of course PC. The only complaint I have is when set to lower resolutions like 1024x768, the text looks blurred. As soon as I changed the resolution to the highest one - 1280x1024 - it became crystal clear. However the fonts are a little too fine at this resolution. Is this a problem with all LCD monitors? Can anyone give me an answer?"
4,Mickey & Minnie's Sweetheart Stories,This Mickey and Minnie movie was very cute and my daughter's loved it!!
2,Mickey Mayhem,My two year old daughter adores Mickey Mouse and friends so I bought her this DVD for Valentine's Day. Its a compilation of old Mickey Mouse cartoons which I found to be very disappointing given the amount of violence. I don't think this is suitable for kids especially young children. Disappointing to say the least...fine for the Mickey Classic Collectors!
4,Spend Valentine's Day with Mickey and Minnie,A great addition to your Disney DVD Collection! It will proably feature most of the the Valentine Mickey and Minnie Valentine's Episodes from the past videos. Its worth it!
2,"*Ack!* or, Brains & Gravity","""He didn't run or shout, but then that would have been hard with only half a face left, the eye on the remainder of his face hanging uselessly down his cheek. The rock hit him on the left side of the head, ..., and as his exposed brains quivered, ready to obey gravity, the snow melted into every orifice, ..."" 500 pages of stuff like this? I figured life was too short to inflict more than the first 80 pages of this novel on myself. You'd be much better off re-reading The Collected Ghost Stories of M. R. James for the 86th time. Another author confusing ""scary"" with ""disgusting"", the only frightening thing about ""The Trickster"" is the author's photograph on the back cover."
