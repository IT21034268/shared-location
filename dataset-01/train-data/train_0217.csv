3,The Wedding Date,I read it after watching the movie. They were very close in proximity.It was good reading for a rainy day. Good for relaxing and some laughs.
1,Irritating and Silly,"I'm surprised that this book has gotten so many stars so far. I thought it was terrible. The main character of the book, Sophy, was so irritating. She's a bitter and angry person which I found absolutely annoying. I'm surprised Josh found her remotely interesting. The story in the end was a bit over the top, too unrealistic and stupid. Another thing that bothered me were the acronyms that the author used. They were too unclear and not easy to understand. It was a waste of time reading this book. I'm surprised I even made it to the end."
3,Better to see the movie,"As an English as second language reader, this book is simple and easy to read. Elisabeth Young really presents a simple, enjoyable and can not wait to the end book.I have seen the movie, and I think contain between movie and book are not the same. However, both have own attention point.I bought the book because I have seen the movie earlier.For me, I still prefer the movie. Maybe if I read the book first, my opinion can be different."
2,what a tangled web we weave.......,"well, i was pretty disappointed for the first 300 pages or so. then, i couldn't put the book down. it was very slow at first with a very wordy dialogue. however, when i got through about 3/4's of the book, it picked up like a whirlwind and proved to be a lot of fun and worth trudging through til the end.sophy started with a simple ""fib"" to keep her mum happy.....and then it spiraled out of control. she couldn't stop the charade and it finally stopped her. it was a bit much with all of the sidestepping she and josh did throughout(for a LONG time). i was happy with the last 1/4 of the plot. the ending made it fun.her sister, belinda, had a great twist. and......blood is thicker than water.don't let the slow, wordy beginning stop you from finishing this read."
4,Fluff,"A good book, recommendable for a lazy summer day. I couldn't put it down - if only to find out what the next plot twist would be. At times its a little much, but as it is a entertainment only type book it does its job quite well."
2,More Bridget Jones than Debra Messing,"The book was okay, but I really loved the movie. There are major differences in the book that completely change the tone. First of all, she's British and more closely resembles Bridget Jones than her movie counterpart. You see a lot more of her friends in the novel.Also, she seems thoroghly preoccupied with her weight. She is not described to look anything like Debra Messing, but rather an overweight ""squishy"" girl, which is completely fine, but it is not fun to read abotu her obsessing about her weight while downing a box of chocolate cigarettes.The writer is British, I believe, so it has more of the British slang, which at first is a little confusing. It's not Thackeray, mind you, but don't expect any American tones.Their relationship is more drawn out, which is fun to read.Still, what I remember most was how we envision all the characters (Domonic included) as a little chunky. They aren't size 0 models, we get it! Now get over it!"
4,Fun,"I had to write in response to the reveiwer of 2002 who found the book tiresome. Not true! Yes, the plot is simple and perhaps even overdone, but you don't read the back and think you're getting anything super original.If you're looking for a fun summer read, pick up this book! Sophy is a great character...self-effacing and lovable."
5,Highly recommended,"Although this isn't a book that will really make you think, it is very intertaining and funny. If you like authors such as Jane Green, I think you would like this too. A cute book, read it in less than a day :)"
4,Very funny!,While the book was somewhat difficult to get into initially- I found myself unable to put it down half way through. Young's description of Sophy's mother is absolutely perfect and is as clear and real as listening to my own mother over the phone. The ending was unexpected- yet she seemed to gloss over the details a bit. There was some real potential for certain events mentioned earlier in the book (i.e. Maggie's married daughter's marital issues) to progress into a more complex story line- this never happened to my dismay... I would have to say A Promising Man was more gripping- but the mother made this book come alive. Definately worth a read.
5,Better than the movie,"I read this long before it was thought to be a movie - so sight unseen (the movie that is), a great read and seriously funny! MUST READ FIRST and hopefully, you and I won't be disappointed by the movie as I know it can't get the entire point across!"
5,"A wonderful, fun read",I love all Elizabeth Young's books and this was no exception. A previous review clearly doesn't agree with the majority and asks 'what is a part?'. A prat is a stupid person - which pretty much speaks for itself! It is a shame if you don't enjoy books written in English - in the UK we often have to put up with books written in 'American' with phrases we don't understand. It doesn't detract from the enjoyment of a fun and well-written book. I hope disappointing reviews and problems over language differences do not put anyone else off reading what is a really good read.
4,"Ask for Trouble, this book is great!","Ask for this one by name! It's a witty romp of a tale revolving around the main character, Sophy. Sophy's a 30year old singleton who makes up a boyfriend to please her mother. Her foibles and wacky antics from that point on will keep you captivated til the last page. One lie leads to another in a domino effect and after a while even Sophy can't keep track of her lies. This tale is a quick, predictable read, but it's enjoyable. It's the perfect 'vacation/going to the beach' book."
4,Lauging out lout,"I read this book in just under two days ... it was just that good. What woman pushing 30 wouldn't get her mother off her back by inventing the perfect man?I laughed out loud at this book several times ... even when I wasn't alone in the room. The chemistery that develops between Sophy and Josh is so good, you can't help but fall in and hope for more even after reading the last page. If Elizabeth Young ever sees this, please write another book soon. Three is not enough."
2,Just Okay,"I purchased this book after seeing that it received some great reviews from other Amazon customers. Basically, I did not enjoy the book very much. I found the main character, Sophy, to be annoying. She appeared to be sloppy, bitchy and the constant mention of her ""wobbly bits"" made me sick to my stomach. The escort/love interest charcter Josh/Dominic was very underdeveloped, as was the ""best friend"" character of Alix.The book was very slow until the last few chapters when it finally got interesting. I spent a lazy weekend in my apt reading this book. It was a quick read, but I got the feeling that at any point I could just toss it aside and not give a crap about what happened to any of the characters."
2,Very Very Disappointing,"Okay, I had high hopes for this book because almost all the reviews were totally glowing. But this is one of my least favorite books. For me, this was a book that I had to hurry up and read because I wanted it to be over. The book was terribly dissapointing to me because it committed the worst book sin of all...I hated the main character. I did not like her at all. I didn't think she deserved to be happy, and I was actually disappointed with the happy ending. I don't see how anyone could love this book so much, I think the main character is a total witch, and I wasn't pulling for her at all, which totally ruins a book no matter how good it may otherwise be, not that this book has anything else going for it. Having said that, please dont waste your time with this awful book. I seriously did not like the book and I can't be the only one...so please take a chance on another book, just don't waste your time with this one."
3,The Trouble with This Novel,"Sophy Metcalfe's mother has a 1950's mentality; she wants Sophy to marry. Without building on the relationship between mother and daughter, Ms. Young, the author, weaves her story.Sophy finds Josh Carmichael aka ""Dominic"" from an escort service. To appease her mother, she passes him off as her beloved. What unfolds is all too predictable. This might not have been a dreadful book if it wasn't so reminiscent of Bridgette Jones' Diary. Bridgette had a weight problem; Sophy has a weight problem. Bridgette craves cigarettes (""fags""); Sophy craves cigarettes (""fags""). Bridgette is jilted by her former lover; Sophy is jilted by her former lover.What is missing is originality and prose so witty, we can't stop laughing. If you're looking for a refreshingly comical novel, this isn't it. Re-read either of the two Bridgette novels or try Susan Elizabeth Phillips for a true romantic comedy extravaganza."
4,Pretty Woman - in reverse,"I am so glad I ignored the bad reviews. The writing is witty, the families totally dysfunctional, the girls pleasingly flawed and the men appropriately 2-dimensional. All a great backdrop for a silly reverse-Pretty Woman kind of story. Sophy needs a gigolo to keep a lie going -- but she (sigh) falls for him! Can it be that he's really NOT what he seems? Will she learn to stop being so controlling so she can get a REAL man (who can tell HER what to do, for a change)? Will she ever be the perfect daughter her mother has guilted her into pretending to be? You get the picture...at first, though I laughed at the witty comments, I kept saying ""yeah, right"" in my head and almost put it down. After a while, though, as the plot thickened and the back-stabbing, bitchy one-upmanship began, it had me hooked. I did not stop til the last word. All I can say is -- thank God men aren't like this!"
3,Straight from the Bridget Jones factory...,"A silly premise, a silly heroine and a predictable outcome. Nevertheless, I devoured this is one sitting. Vacuous books by British authors are so much better than those by American authors; I'm not sure if it's because British colloquialisms are so much more clever than American ones, or perhaps the heroines in their books are more likeable and easier to relate to. Whatever the reason, it would be diffucult to dislike this book as long as you're not expecting a classic work of literature and are just looking for some rainy-day escapism."
5,Made into a Movie,"This book was made into the movie ""The Wedding Date"" with Debra Messing as the delightfully sarcastic Sophy who has to produce a charming, successful, ideal boyfriend to show up with at the wedding of Sophy's ""perfect"" sister Belinda."
1,THE WEDDING DATE,I WANTED TO ORDER THE SOUNDTRACK FOR THIS MOVIE BUT I COULD NOT LOCATE IT. PLEASE ADVISE IF AVAILABLE. I CANNOT EXPLAIN AN EXPERIENCE SINCE I COULD NOT LOCATE IT.
2,Disappointed,I was expecting so much more from this movie. Was looking forward to a good and morally based movie but by the end of the movie I wasn't sure what I had just watched. Very disappointed!
2,Maybe I'm missing something,"I was looking forward to viewing this movie. We watched it on Easter Sunday as a treat. I kept waiting for the meat of the story to kick in but was disappointed. The story was too chopped up for my taste with little opportunity for the characters to truly develop and draw you into their stories. I think the basis for a good moral story is there but just didn't flow. It felt like I was watching a ""Cliff's notes"" version of the play."
5,Perfect Gift,"Our pastor has been preparing for a trip to Cameroon. When I gave him this book, he was very impressed with the content--so impressed we decided it was the perfect gift to take to the head of the missions board in Africa."
3,"Just good, not great...","The Africa Bible Commentary is an attempt to provide a particularly Afro-centered commentary on the whole Bible by over 70 scholars. It is a very interesting book, in parts. Issues such as AIDS, poverty, slavery, polygamy, etc. are covered from a Christian perspective that opens a window into some of the specific concerns and convictions of African Christians. The weakness of the book is that it is fairly lightweight in the exegetical treatment of the text itself. I did not find it a very useful guide in interpretation; but it did provide some interesting perspective on various social and ethical issues facing Christianity today. All in all, the commentary did not live up to its reviews and advertisments."
5,HOTTEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD!!!,"I actually bought this calendar at her concert in August and the moment I saw it, I knew I had to get it! Mariah is just so amazingly gorgeous and by each flip of the page, she takes my breath away! This calendar makes me look forward to the 2004 year!"
4,My Big Sister is so Bossy Review,"This book was about a girl named Effie and her troubles with her sister. I really enjoyed this book. I can relate to Effie's bad experiences with her sister and I can relate to her being very sad when her grandpa died. I think that The author could have done a little better when she was describing everything and could have made some of the characters a little more lively. I really liked how the author made Maxey sound really rude at first, but then she gradually got nicer and eventually was very nice to her sister. I think that this book was geared to all fifth, sixth, and seventh grade girls. Overall I really liked this book and I recommend it to all girls!"
3,Not for a fourth-grader.,"To begin with, I do like this book. I don't think I would if I were an actual fourth-grader, though. It's just a bit too complex, and I don't think most fourth-graders are as observant as Effie is. Hence, it's not believable that the narrator is really a ten-year-old.I also know that every time I laughed, I laughed at Effie the stupid ten-year-old and not with her. The tone of the book encouraged me to. Not good, considering this book is aimed at fellow ten-year-olds.Finally, the ending feels incomplete. Maybe if the author added something about the older sister's bossiness, but as it is, the title and the beginning has nothing to do with the overall content of the book. Yeah, so Maxey is bossy and it all started with a pack of lies. So what? Not very conclusive."
1,Waste of time and money,"I agree with bibliophile. Most of the 'free' things were catalogs. Here's a sampling of the 'free' stuff. L.L Bean Catalogs, pamplets on raising puppies and kittens from Purina, a free copy of 'Sheer Facts About Hoisery', a Lane Bryant catalog, Lilian Vernon and Harriet Carter catalogs, a free photo or greeting from the president. And the list goes on and on. What do these things have to to with seniors? There are about 100 pages in the back where they talk about free prescription programs and some State sponsored programs for seniors. That might be the only redeeming thing in this book. I returned it to Amazon. I only gave it one star because Amazon doesn't allow zero."
1,A disappointment,"Most of the items in this book were not specifically focused on deals for seniors. I got the feeling that the same contents could have several different covers and be marketed to other niches. In addition, so many of the free things were ""free catalogs"" or ""free recipes""...anyone can get that information off of the Internet without buying a book!"
3,Walking Dead,"Walking Dead was really the only reason why I bought this CD. Z Trip did a great job on the music and Chester's vocals were well performed; however, I did find some other tracks I found decently crafted after giving the album a listen. ""Furious"", ""3rd Gear"", and ""Revolution"" turned out to be some good tracks. I just didn't like how Z-Trip relied on other artists on this album. I wanted to hear more Z-Trip and less lyrics. For the tracks he did create on his own, it's worth a listen. 3/5."
4,Z-Trip brings the 'fun' Turntable-ism,"This mix is well done and a lot of fun. It skirts a lot of styles and moods, but at is core its still a TurnTable-ism album.side note: Eric ""MeLLowJive"" obviously listened to one track and assumed the whole album was like that... I guess he'd never heard of Z-Trip before and didn't do any research, but this album is all about TURNTABLE-ism and mixing disparate (big word, I know... look it up) styles. Think DJ Shadow, DJ Krush, ColdCut, etc..."
2,Crap,Only good song on this album is walking dead and that is one of two that you can't download through amazon by its self.
3,"Old school hip-hop fans, get it...","Good alternative to the otherwise crap top 50 ""rap"" out there on the radio. However, it lacks two key features that I found z-trip's other work, heavy beats & mash-ups."
2,downshifting...,"This great underground master DJ deservedly gets a release on a major record label... but there are too many rappers, not enough personality in the production, and obvious restraint in the sampling (surely the result of copyright clearance issues.) Compared to Z-Trip's amazing and audacious Uneasy Listening with DJ-P and Live at the Future Primitive with Radar, this is just a bore... yawn..."
2,It's an album,"Shifting Gears is Z-trip's first full production album, and because of that, I am not disappointed. However the score of 2 comes from the fact that this isn't really my thing musically. For some great really hiphop orientated sets check out 'Live in LA' or 'Future Primitive' with Z and Radar."
1,Not what you would expect,"If you thought this cd might be good because you heard Walking Dead on the radio, you are going to be disappointed. This cd isn't the industrial, alternative new rock I thought it would be. Walking Dead reminded me of something dark, like the movie Underworld or Queen of the Damned and those soundtracks had some good songs. Unfortunately, like the song Everything Changes says, what a waste of time and my mind. The rap is pathetic, singing about nothing important. If you like ""B Boys"" and turntables and a cameo from Chester to get rock credit, you will like this. They try to sound educated and important on Shock and Awe, but it is all rehashed shots at Pres. Bush and Iraq, which we all already know, and this cd is not going to bring down the whitehouse. NOT A ROCK ALBUM!!! NOT A GOOD RAP ALBUM!!"
1,Do not buy these!,"I loved the look of these shoes, they were super comfortable and cute....until they fell apart! I haven't even had them for a week, the weaving has come undone in three spots and the sole is coming off of one of them. I'm disgusted that I spent $80 on these. I bought a similar pair from Bass 2 years ago for less money and they're still in perfect condition after a lot of use. I haven't worn these a lot and I don't beat them up when I do wear them. Don't buy these shoes, they're not even worth 10 bucks, spend your money elsewhere."
5,My daily shoe,"I have been wearing this shoe for years. I have it in red, black and navy. I'm replacing the navy pair while online. I have a narrow heel and this shoe fits perfectly. I try other shoes and my heel slips in and out as I walk but not in the Trotters Liz. This shoe goes perfectly with casual skirts, pants, jeans or just about any outfit that a flat shoe works with. I wear this shoe daily and it's a main staple in my wardrobe. It's comfortable, the woven leather breathes in hot weather. Great shoe."
3,too narrow,"Was really shocked when this shoe arrived and could not get it on. Rechecked the size. Yes, medium width, correct size. Measured sole and upper. The sole is the same as my other medium width shoes, at the widest point, but narrower along the rest of the length and most of all, the upper was an inch and a half narrower at the wide part of the foot. Have since been able to stretch it out enough to wear it for brief periods. It will be a good shoe if it can stretch a bit more in the toes. The design is otherwise good, attractive and well made. Loved the fact that the sole was thicker than similar shoes and has a little tread. (Could still use a little more tread.)"
4,great shoe...but,"I love this shoe and have purchased in the past. True to size and extremely comfortable. First time I wore them was for an all-day flight and evening appointment...they felt like ""broken-in shoes"" and are wonderful. HOWEVER, I do not feel the PEWTER color is correctly represented in this shoe. I think pewter should be more of a dull silver shade. These shoes are definitely more GOLD leaning towards bronze."
2,Run small,I have 4 pairs of trotters shoes all 8 1/2. I could not even get my heel into the left shoe. Now I have to waste time and money to send back and get a new pair. I also ordered wider...I think Trotter shoes in general have been running smaller than a few years ago.
2,Great fit but wrong color,"I have 3 pair of these shoes and love them. I have a very narrow heel and do not have a problem with my heel coming out of the Liz shoe. I was looking for a grey/pewter color shoe, so was excited to see it was available in this style. I was extremely disappointed when I received it . The color of the shoe looks gold, not remotely pewter. I hope Trotter's will make a grey shoe in the future. I am returning this pair."
1,Trotters Navy Shoe,"I have ordered Trotters shoes directly from the manufacturer, and this was the first time I ordered this shoe from Amazon. The price was cheaper, but the shoe is disappointing and I'm wondering if indeed it is a true Trotter shoe. The leather is not soft, and the shoe makes noise when I walk. I will not buy Trotters through Amazon again."
3,good shoe but not of high quality,My usual size 7.5M runs a little bit wider. the leather is not of good quality because the front part is already broken
2,not-ters,"bought these for work. cant really even wear them to work because they are so uncomfortable. I cant get too mad because I'm the one who didnt realize they were 'narrows'. make sure you dont buy narrows (N) if you dont have narrow feet!! but the worst part is i literally wore them around the HOUSE once and the soles already looked worn! So pretty much I was stuck with them. Also the natural color is awful. I will certainly have to try to put some darker polish on them or something. The old brown ones I have look so much more classy. These just look weird. Should have sent them back when I saw the color but had to try to 'make it work'....ugh, big mistake. Now I'm out of 50$ and STILL dont have work shoes! lol"
2,where did they get these shoes???,"I can not lie..I was rather disappointed in this order.First of all I get the shoes on time which was awesome..but when I opened the shipping box..I found this old shop worn box that looked like it had been in a store since the 70's...the leather on the shoes were scratched on the back..and they smelled funny!! I wanted to return them asap but my daughter being the diligent little housekeeper she is..threw the box away!!! I have always been pleased with my purchases from Amamzon..but this order was not one of them...wont deter me from ordering again but ""just saying"".."
1,very uncomfortable,"Despite the fact that the shoes were labeled ""wide"", they were extremely tight at the toes. I had to send them back."
3,perfect but a little too narrow,had to send back to get wider size...ususally wear a med but need a wide in this...gorgeous shoe for a flat!
1,Tight!,This shoe is extremely tight in the toe area. Had to return them. I won't buy this type of shoe again.
5,Great Shoe. Great Price,"Trotter's are one of the best shoes out there for folks like me with narrow feet. I am so thankful they continue to give good quality, good value footwear to those of us who can't just walk into a store and buy any shoe. Thanks!!"
5,Classic Trotters,The Sizing was perfect. It's a classic shoe and very comfortable and stylish. I might buy it in another color.
2,No!,"The good- well price $19 (ivory color) for a leather shoes that have a light color insoles in each and every color of that model is always a plus (won't color your feet).The bad- well they do run narrow. Also the side of the shoe seems to run a bit high and did hurt bone on my ankle plus these are very stiff!Knowing that leather shoes do have ability to get bigger with time, these seem to be rather firm (double layer of leather- first woven, second inside), so if you hope that you might walk them off, it might not be as easy as normally is with other shoes."
1,Trotters,"Didn't get what I ordered. Instead of Liz loafer, I got black patent and they looked like clown shoes when I put them on. Way too big."
3,Buy Dreams in the Pleasure Garden,This is nice but I think Dreams in the Pleasure Garden(a compilation of secular works by Machaut) and Messe de Nostre Dame (his famous mass) are a bit more interesting musically.
5,Willow Weep for Me - sweet melancholy,"Wes Montgomery's thumbed octave strumming adds original surprises to the good range of upbeat and downbeat selections found on this ablum. Hard to find in stores, grab it while you can in any form you can find it - import or domestic. I've sampled a few other Montgomery albums (my other favorite being The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery) but this has the best mood. The last three tunes are devine! His lilting, slow vibrato phrasing in tunes like ""Oh! You Crazy Moon"" and ""Misty"" make this a winning selection for those who like a little blue in their jazz. And the impeccable up-tempo ""Four on Six"" may just be one of the best works of this early jazz master."
3,Wes With Horns,"Wes plays well on this cd, but I didn't like the horns that Verve dubbed in after the fact. You can also get this and the rest of ""Smokin' at the Haf Note"" on ""Impressions: The Verve Jazz Sides."" I tried that one too but didn't like the orchestrated stuff there either. All I really wanted was to hear Wes do Impressions (I love that song). So I ended up getting the ""Complete Live in Paris"" cd. That is a great cd, and it has Impressions on it, so I'm happy."
5,Still the calming voice of reason....,"I just purchased the revised version of my favorite childcare book from when I had my other kids (ages 6 and 9). Dr. Brazelton is still my favorite for his comprehensive, authoritative, yet non-judgmental, realistic advice. He has a tremendous understanding of the needs of children, in a way adults typically can't understand. In addition to addressing each stage of development in ""Touchpoints"", the section on special situations is extremely helpful!!!! I have loved every book he's ever written (Infants and Mothers is my other favorite) and find his advice invaluable and in the best interest of the child! He is a true child advocate and has the most calming voice to listen to...."
3,Not for reference.,"I bought several baby books when I had my first child. This was the one I used the least. Perhaps if I wanted to learn about development, it may be more helpful. I'm in the healthcare profession, and know the basics. I was looking for a quick reference for troubleshooting purposes, and this was not that book."
4,Excellent,"This book is very well organized, both in contents and in chronology. I really enjoyed the writing style, in which the issues are covered by example, rather than a more aggressive ""do this, don't do that"" approach."
4,Touchpoints: a must read for new parents and parents to be,"very clearly written, simple layout by developmental stages, good info. This book was recommended by a friend as the only book that I'd need on childhood development."
5,Fantastic parenting book,"I love this book- very useful for parents. It goes over many normal behaviors of your child's developmental stage, which really helps validate your experiences and gives you great tactics for handling challenges. Also, it really empowers you as a parent to participate in your child's health."
2,Not at all what I expected,"I did not know much about this book before I purchased it, but I expected it to be about my baby's development just like it says on the cover. Instead this book seems to be mostly about how Dr. Brazelton interacts with parents and what he does when babies come for a checkup. Instead of focusing on babies, it goes on about how he tricks fathers into thinking babies recognize their voices or how mothers who come to his office look bedraggled because they are spending too much time dressing their babies in impractical outfits. He even seems to mock new parents for being so careful with their babies. There is useful information in this book, but if you aren't looking for a book that tells you how to be a pediatrician, you might want to keep looking."
2,Not what I was looking for,"It's a fine book, but I was looking for something that would tell me more about my baby's development and how to meet him at his level and less about how great the author is."
2,well documented,I found Professor Butz Book solidly documented but the conclusions lacking. He certainly showed up the bias of the Nuremburg trial and the pictures from the British War Museum certainly supported his case on the Typhus epidemic. I have written articles on the subject and interviewed both victims and jailers and I believe that the real truth will be lost somewhere in between. Butz at least has the courage to express his opinion.
1,Conspiracy Theorists Will Love It,"I just returned from the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., where I had the sad privilege to view thousands of pieces of what historians call ""prime source material""--film footage, letters, Nazi publications, and other physical evidence. Conclusion: Butz is an articulate idiot. Over the past 20 years I have enjoyed debunking a variety of popular conspiracy theories, from the ""Hollow Earth"" to 9/11. I have noticed that all such theories have certain common features, as do the people whose mindsets are susceptible to them. This one will be no different. Like other promulgators of myths, Butz will gather an appreciative audience of those who are predisposed to believe him."
1,Hoax of the Twentieth Century,"Never mind that this anti-Semite makes money on the deliberately contrived and cruel nonsense in this book; what nobody seems to add is that he can't write either! Yes, use this book as an example of how NOT to reason or how NOT to write for beginners!"
1,What is he talking about?,"I agree with many of the reviews on this book. This guy 'Butz' should concerntrate on his area of expertise, which is engineering science NOT HISTORY! I think that if you are going to write a book, at least know what you are talking about. I don't understand how he could possibly be a professor at a university..."
1,A bad book,"A thoroughly discredited book, this work is built on faulty logic, poor use of evidence,and a thin veneer (and only that) of scholarly rigor. If I ever teach a grad class onHolocaust denial/misrepresentation, this would be a book that I would use to demonstrateto my students how some can look scholarly to pursue mendacious ends."
1,"Profoundly ignorant ""professor""","It is impossible to understand how so deeply ignorant person, who never read any documents or documentary boors including ""Nuremberg Trial"", can hold a professor position with any American university. Definitely, something wrong with American education system."
1,Denying the best documented series of events,"Denying the best documented series of events in modern European history continues as an industry of lies, falsifications, and sheer chicanery. Masquerading as serious scholarship, the work of these feverish and unscrupulous men remains one of the ugliest blights in our intellectual landscape. Butz's book is an early effort. Why is it being reissued at this time? What can be gained except a defense/exoneration of Nazi Germany and a vicious antsemitic continuation of that same regime? For shame. First amendment rights aside, no respectable publishing house would go near this stinker."
1,99 cents indeed,"What is it about academics crossing disciplines that seems to cause them to become completely certain and completely wrong? Just awful in the same way ""Chariots of the Gods"" is awful. This kind of stuff is not what our brains are for. The world is what it is, in beautiful and terrible ways. Learn about it or don't, but just making stuff up is peeing in the pool."
2,Not Accurate,"I was very disappointed in the movie and stopped watching it midway. This is not an accurate account of St. Rita's life, I would recommend reading on her.At one point in the movie, I thought it was going to get trashy because on her wedding night, there was lots of kissing, sensuality, and then finally they walk off in the other part of the bedroom. This could have been left out of the movie, it did not need to show this, or all the times Paolo has to take his shirt off, and they could have left out the word [...]. This is suppose to be a movie on a saints life.It's already hard finding good family and catholic movies to watch but I'm not going to let me child watch False information that proclaims to be TRUTH. This includes other religious movies."
2,this is NOT saint rita,"The film is beautiful, historical setting is excellent... but.. where is she, Santa Rita that we know? 12 yo girl forced to marry, where is her inner life and what about the receiving of stigmata which was not a small deal and the miracles of her entry to the convent... I would appreciate a film, which would focus more on her work of christian love, not clashing of the swords. I wanted to see the light of this advanced soul, shining of barbarian customs of medieval italy... I did not find it."
4,very long movie-3hrs 20 min-very good though-too long,"I enjoyed the movie-you can tell its foreign made-many scenes would have been cut out as not needed-if American made. It was good,though way too long. It has 2 parts."
5,esta preciosa,"Vivo en mexico, compre la pelicula porque me la habían recomendado, me ayudo mucho saber que tenia subtitulos en español. La hemos visto varias veces en familia, es una pelicula de la que se puede sacar mucho provecho, tanto para el enriquecimiento personal, como para el familiar ya que a través de ella podemos por decirlo asi, tocar el amor humano con las manos. Definitivamente, la actuación me parece maravillosa, me gusta escucharla en su idioma original porque puedo apreciarla mucho mas."
5,THE ITALIANS DO IT RIGHT!,"THE ACTING IS SUPERB. THE COSTUMES PUT YOU IN ANOTHER TIME. THE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS OF THE ACTORS MAKE YOU FEEL THEIR EMOTIONS. IT HAS ROMANCE, BETRAYEL, ACTION, SUSPENSE, SORROW AND IN THE END IT LEAVES YOU WITH A SENSE OF THE GOODNESS OF MAN AND INSPIRES YOU TO NEVER GIVE UP NO MATTER HOW BAD THINGS GET. PEOPLE DO CHANGE FOR THE BETTER. IT DOES NOT HAVE NUDITY. IT HAS NO GRATUITOUS VIOLENCE."
1,IT's not true,Too bad I cannot give zero stars... read the booklet that comes with the movie and you will see that it is all made up!! I could not believe it! The movie makers should go to confession for that:)
2,"Good acting, but the story is changed","I was disappointed to find that they made this movie into a love story, portraying Rita as a woman who always wanted to get married and not join a religious order. There is even one part in the movie where she says something about religious life not being for her because she wants a family. And yet, this is what catholic.org says of her life:""She was born in Roccaporena, near Spoleto, Italy, in 1381, and expressed from an early age the desire to become a nun. Her elderly parents insisted that she be married at the age of twelve to a man described in accounts of her life as cruel and harsh. She spent eighteen extremely unhappy years, had two sons, and was finally widowed when her husband was killed in a brawl""Nevertheless, she is portrayed as falling madly in love with Paolo and working very hard to get approval to marry him. Not a good portrayal of what she went through in her life's desires and marriage, in my opinion."
5,Gift,"This DVD made an excellent gift. It was extremely well packaged and easy to wrap and give. The recipient seemed to enjoy receiving it, and I hope she will share it with me after she watches it."
4,Great Movie!,"It increased my devotion & love for St. Rita. Long movie, but very good. She was so humble!Everybody should watch this movie! I want to see more movies like that!"
5,GREAT DEAL!!,"We just bought this toy for our 3 year old son, and it is great!He hasn't officially been able to play with it yet (b/c it's a Christmas present), but my husband and I couldn't resist. It's made of a neutral, wood color, so it matches anywhere in your home and it's not wobbly like so many other easels we looked at. Also, the chalk board is a REAL chalkboard, not plastic like the one on the Little Tikes easel. The only downside that I found was that there was only one supply tray, but that's not a big deal. As for the screws that stick out, they are tiny and not even close to my son's height(maybe his height at 6 mo)so there's no danger of him losing an eye on it. Overall, it's a GREAT buy for the money...especially since it's on sale this week!"
1,I am disappointed.,My son got this as a gift and we were both excited about it. It was easy to assemble and I couldn't wait to do lessons with him on it. The dry erase board worked well and cleaned well with the wipe off markers. What disappointed me was that the chalk board would not accept the chalk. I used 3 different types of chalk. Then in 2 days the screws that held the paper feeder bar were popping out. I did contact PJ KIDS customer service and they are looking into my problem with this item. It could be that I got the defected one out of the bunch. But I can sure tell you it wasn't fun!
4,Very Durable,I bought this for my sister about 4 years ago and it still looks good. She still plays with it at age 10.I think the quality of the blackboard is better than the other easels made by known companies. I would definitely buy this again and recommend it to others.
2,Beginners book to what you can find in the night sky,"This chatty book is a great introduction to what you can see from your backyard at night. The author doesn't go into much detail as he discusses each object (the planets and a few of the more prominent deep-sky galaxies and nebulas.) There are a few sidebars that give interesting historical trivia. A great book to interest someone in astronomy or an arm-chair astronomer, but not a good book to use while actually looking at the stars. The b&w photos is the book are a waste of ink given that they are so dark. And, the star chart included is really nothing more than a constellation chart. Few stars are included and no deep sky objects. A nice chart for the wall, but not a good reference."
2,Do not recommend this textbook,"The examples do not show steps specifically, it expect you can apply math concepts you haven't used in years. Only half of the problems have answer keys, and some of the answer keys are wrong. When I had pre-calc last year, many students got confused with the wrong answer key. Even my math teacher has admit that there is an error on the answer key."
5,Outstanding book with lots of useful solutions and tips!,This book is an outstanding reference for all sorts of Windows tricks. I have utilized many recommendations in it with much success including using a batch file to clear the Documents menu as well as streamlining the dial-up networking process. I recommend this book as a definite must have desktop reference for all windows users beginner to advanced.
1,Don't waste your money.,This book is for people who want to feel good about running Linux. This is just the rehash of the Internet on to paper along with Anti-Microsoft bandwagon chanting.
5,A must see movie for anyone interested in Japanese history,A fast paced movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The action is fast and the scenery is beautiful. Haruki Kadokawa does an outstanding job keeping the story real.
5,"The battle of Kawanakajima 1553,1554,1555,1556,and 1563.","Battle scenes filmed in Canada,story revolves around two 'Daimyo'(warlord) Nagao Kagetora (later known as Uesugi Kagetora,Uesugi Terutora,and finally Uesugi Kenshin) who fights another 'Daimyo' Takeda Harunobu (later known as Takeda Shingen). Uesugi Kenshin (Born 1530 - Died 1578),and Takeda Shingen(Born 1521 - Died 1573). Great historical film on late 16th century Japan."
5,Where can I get the DVD?,"If you liked The Last Samurai, this movies makes Cruise's movies look like a grade school play. I've been looking for the DVD for over 6 years with no success. You cannot find a better war movie, even drama than this one, simply the best ever."
1,Title does NOT match description! Call Global Pets FIRST!,"The title is for Caribbean Crunch, but the description is for Instant Nuts for Alfredo. Ingredients are not for Instant Nuts for Alfredo, but seem to be for Caribbean Crunch. So which you'll get if you order, I do not know."
3,Classic poem,"Doesn't grab us very well, though it is a good description of the *original* fairies (before they were disneyfied).As noted, the poem concerns the theft and death of a young girl. She's shown waking up on the endpage, but really, it's clear that she's intended to have died. Read before you buy."
5,Great Clipper,"A great clipper for pets. I have two Yorkies and this clipper gives me the cordless flexibility to get the job done fast (they don't hold still too long). Very professional quality, not like the ""cheaper"" models -- very sturdy."
2,Doesn't hold a charge.,"My clipper is about a year old, and a full charge now lasts less than 10 minutes. Unlike an earlier cordless clipper I have had, which allowed me to change batteries, this one does not. While the charge holds, it works very well, but a cordless clipper that only lasts 5 minutes or so is basically useless."
4,Could Use a Solid Bottom,"I like the product very much, but have added a 3/8"" plywood bottom cut to 12"" diameter to prevent the legs from wearing through the foam."
4,Solid Bag,"I dig this little buddy. As a lot of reviewers have mentioned the bottom is a little light and I was worried about the three legs of the dutch oven busting through. I found that a 12"" pizza pan works great. I throw the coals and dutch oven on the pizza pan for cooking and then it sits in the bottom of the tote bag to protect the bottom. Works great. 4 stars for not throwing a couple pouches on there for storage."
3,"Great product, needs a hard bottom.","I just measured, cut, and added a 2 layer plywood bottom, the upper layer drilled to accommodate the legs of the dutch oven.Great for keeping soot off of everything in your cookbox. Protects the costly investment as well."
4,worth it,"I'm so glad we bought the tote bag, it makes it so much easier to store and to take the dutch oven places. I was a little disappointed that the lid lifter and lid stand don't fit into the tote bag w/ the oven so I can transport and store the whole thing together, but, I guess you can't have everything."
3,It's just okay.,I bought this to carry my Lodge Logic 5-Quart Double Dutch Oven and Casserole with Skillet Cover. It is too large for this oven but it still does the job. It is made of light weight material and I am worried about it's longevity but time will tell. So far so good.
3,Not very substantial for $23,"There's not a whole lot to this tote bag. It'll do the job and hold up. But with padding only for the bottom, I don't see why this is $23."
4,Pretty good so far,The is a pretty good product so far. I of course use it to store my dutch oven but i store it in my camper and it's held up to the road also i like the fact it's a little bit bigger than the dutch oven. With the extra room i store the cast-iron trivet in the bottom of the bag and the lid lifter on top.
2,not sturdy,"This diaper bag was perfect, so I thought, because I am a Precious Moments collector. I received the bag and used it for a short while before it ripped at the pockets. The cheap plastic lining ripped very easily. I would not recommend it, especially for the price!"
2,A Verdi Disappointment,"The notes mention that Verdi chose the least worst story available to get this one out in a hurry. The other choices must have been terrible. Has some good performances, but it is not one that I would watch over and over like La Traviata"
5,"Excelent singers, wanderful mise en scene","An unknown Verdí, funny, romántic, great músic. Helps You to understand how Rossinis influence was useful but overpassed. The production id beutiful and elegant. Singers havre Excelent voces and at the same time are great actors, with humor and intellligence. A wanderful experience."
5,"Great buy, sturdy table, and nice looking","I love this changing table. When assembled correctly it is very sturdy and safe. My son is now 14 months old, and I still use it (with a steady hand on him though!). I had considered buying a more expensive changing tower, but now from experience I know I don't want to be reaching in doors and drawers to get what I need, it is handier in this open unit. I would reccomend this table to anyone. I don't see anything cheap about it, if you use it for what it is intended, (diaper storage, supplies, blankets, etc.), it is perfect."
5,Good changing table for realistic price!,We purchased this table to go with the White Jenny Lind crib we bought. Table was very easy to put together and is extremly sturdy. Having two children I couldn't possibly see the point in spending $150 or more for a changing table that you can really only use for the first year depending on the size of your child. We've been using ours now for 4 months and I have no complaints.
5,Perfect!,"My husband and I purchased the matching crib after we received this table for a shower gift...we thought we were going to use it as a spare in our room since we have a 1 1/2 story house. After assembling this peice, we loved it enough to keep in the nursery (and avoided buying a more expensive peice).Quality and craftsmanship are great...we are very pleased!"
1,Don't try to put this together during the summer!,"When we took our pieces out of the box, we noticed that two of the three boards were warped. Now, we live in Ma. It's not that hot up here, around 85 degrees today. Three of us tried to slide the boards into the slots they were supposed to go into. I'm sure that once you can get it together it's great for space, but don't try to put it together if it's warm out!"
1,Horrible! Horrible,"I was so prepared to love this. We bought the crib a few months ago... received this for a shower gift and were sorely disappointed. When I opened the package, screws and parts fell out. Nothing was bagged. Additionally, there were NO instructions. The changing table is NOT made by the same company that the crib is. The lack of quality in the materials is glaring once the package is opened. Secondly, I received 2 of the same ends. Hard to explain, but basically its like having 2 left shoes. I could have put this together, but holes would have been exposed to the outside, being unslightly. I did finally, _almost_ get this together, without instructions, just to have a wood piece pull apart and splinter, damaging the wood beyond repair. Needless to say, I returned this. I didn't bother getting a changing table! Hope you have better luck!"
1,"NEEDLESS TO SAY , WE WILL NOT BE BUYING THIS BRAND IN ANYTHING ANYMORE!!!!!!","This product is built just like its matching crib ,awful!!!! Most of the wood is cracked already,the shelves are falling apart.Right from the second that we got it home, and started putting it together,we noticed the wood near the holes were cracked!!! Its hitting the garbage tonight!!We will not be buying Jenny Lind ,Delta products ever again."
2,A Nice Table if you could assemble it,"The finish and design are nice, but it was impossible to assemble the shelves. The grooves to insert the wood into were machined too narrow. After returning the item to Toys-R-Us, the manager informed me that he had seen 3 of these come back for the same reason. He said he had even tried to help someone else assemble it with a hammer and sand paper with no luck! Maybe they got a bad batch? I'd stay away anyhow."
3,Okay table,We got this changing table as a gift for our baby shower. I'm disappointed that the shelves just kind of rest on the sides and do not fit into any grooves as is does in the front and the back. To me it looks kind of cheap that way. It appears to be pretty sturdy though which I guess is most important.
4,Good table for price and practicality. . .,"This table is very cute and sturdy once it's put together. . .but very tricky to actually put together. The directions are just okay, and it takes 2 people to put this one together properly. I would recommend it, however, if you want a practical table for a reasonable price that looks nice."
5,Worth the money!,I bought this changing table at a used baby store because I recieved the crib as a hand me down. Even being used this changing table is great. There are no problems. It's very sturdy and durable for the price. I have the shelves loaded up with alot of things and no problems at all. The shelves are made of a type of posterboard wood but they are sturdy. The pad that came with it is very thin and cheap so I purchased a better one. But this changing table is definitely worth the moderate price.
2,"Price Okay, but quality poor","I bought this item along with the Jenny Lind bed. The bed is very good for the price. The changing table was difficult to put together (some of the screws would not tighten). The weight limit on the size of the baby is not good too. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for.... I would suggest paying a little more and get a better quality table."
4,A Good Deal!!,"I bought this at a second hand store (...). It looks just like the one in the picture and was built pretty sturdy. I hadn't intended to use it; just wanted to fill an empty space in the nursery with something common. The minute I put it in the nursery I knew I had to test it out, and it was a good find! I probably wouldn't have paid (...)for it simply b/c I didn't buy it to use it. But, now, I intend on using it, and recommend it to others as a wonderful open style dressing table. It's sturdy, pretty, comes with a pad, has a belt for baby attached, has a lot of baby room on the table, and has lot's of storage space underneath. It also looks good with most cribs, if you're afraid of mismatching."
1,A Weighty Problem,"This dressing table is advertised for babies age 0-3 years. The shelves are made of a thin composite rather than wood. When you open the box and read the directions for assembly you will find in large letters ""Maximum Weight 20 lbs"". This weight restriction means that most one year olds will be too heavy for the table. I suggest buying something stronger that you can use for a longer time."
3,How long will it last?,"I have a four month baby, and while the table works now, I'm wondering how much longer it's going to last. The shelves are reinforced cardboard, not very strong. Yes there is lots of shelf space for all of the diapers and supplies that you get. I'm afraid that it's going to wear out before our first baby is out of diapers and I'm going to have to buy a new table if we decide to have another baby. I might as well have splurged...on one nice table that will last forever as opposed to two cheaper tables. The paint is flaking from me just rubbing up against it. It doesn't look the best and it's only four months old."
1,Very disappointed.,"Others seem to have had a much better experience with this item, and we can't understand why. When assembling the table, it quickly became clear that it was poorly made and the components were badly engineered. For example, one of the bars would not accept the screw that the manufacturer provided for it - the screw would not bite. The dowels were not well sanded and seemed as if they could cause splinters. We decided it wasn't worth continuing the assembly and returned it. Also note, the shelves are made of a very thin composite wood and are flimsy. This thing is overpriced and unsafe."
2,It's Not the Best,I bought this item because it matches the crib I got. When I first put it together I actually cracked the wood a little...my baby is three months old and the shelves fell apart about three weeks ago...if they were made of a stronger material I would rate this product high because it was very useful before the shelves fell apart..now I am starting to get a little worried..if the shelves fell apart then maybe the actually changing part would also..I am glad it has the cross bars but I don't think I will be using the table much longer..and I will not be saving it ..it will be going in the garbage. It also was horrible to put together.
5,A Great changing table that holds up!,"We bought this changing table from someone who bought it new five years ago, and I must say that it is in great condition! The previous owner used it with two kids, and after we gave it a quick paint job, it looks brand new! It is still very sturdy and we have no problems with the shelves warping or not being strong at all. We did have to tigten the screws, but no complaints about that because who knows if the previous owner ever did. And it is a very pretty changing table! We highly recommend it!"
1,I hate this table,"When setting up the table, it became clear that this is a poorly made item. The changing table bed and shelves are plaster board, and the directions for assembly are confusing. But more importantly, the company sent us the wrong crossbar - it did not even fit the set nor looked like the other 3 crossbars. When I called the customer service line the next day (during weekday business hours), a recording told me to leave my name and address and description of the problem. There was no way to get in touch with any real person there! This greatly frustrated me. I immediately went online to Amazon to return this item."
2,"Main frame is sturdy,shevles are terrible!","This changing table went into the trash after my baby @ 8 months crawled onto the lower shelf. The shelf gave way. The shelf had previously bowed with weight over 10 lbs(baskets w/supplies and diapers). So, you basically can't store anything on the shelves!Most children aren't potty trained until 2 1/2...buy a good quality changing table. This product is not of good quality.FYI-Top and frame are very stable."
1,Terrible Quality,"I thought that this was a cute, old fashioned changing table when I purchased this product. The reason this changing table is inexpensive is becaue it is CHEAP and poorly made. Unfortunately when putting it together several of the pieces cracked and split. We had to order new pieces. When the replacement pieces came they were different from the original ones and required different hardware. The hardware was not sent with the new pieces so we had to go out and buy what we needed from a hardware store. When it was finally completed it was not very sturdy so I am going out to look for a new changing table. This was a very poor purchasing decision. I reccommend spending a little more and getting something that won't fall apart!"
2,Not a great table,"This was given to us as a gift. We put it on the registry because it matched the crib we bought. The crib was so easy to put together that I did it myself, however, it took me and my husband to put this together and it was still difficult! We had such a hard time trying to keep the shelves in place while we put the sides on and if we tightened the screws too tight(which didn't seem tight enough)then the wood cracked. I think the hardest part was putting on the rounded top piece. I was certain it wasn't going to fit and I'm still surprised we finally got it on there. The table was also chipped a little in some spots when we got it out of the package. All-in-all this table is definitely not worth the money that was paid and I hope we can get some good use out of it."
4,Funny!,"I saw this book in a book store in Chicago, but it was too expensive. Yay Amazon for being reasonable. I love all animals and am completely against any and all cruelty, BUT this is hilarious! It is just art! Thats one thing people have to remember. Dont take it as a literal ""How to"" book! Its simply funny! Its a very entertaining coffee table book!"
2,Clipped Wings,"I'll start this by saying that I loved Riley's Bunny Suicides. Jones' Canceled Flight on the other hand comes across as wanting. The humour is forced and the art, while well done, doesn't seem to complement the ideas. Hopefully someone out there can come up with better pigeonicide work. I'm giving two stars because there were some good moments in the books like method #12."
1,Appauling! It deserves less than zero stars.,"I have a very healthy sense of humor but there is just nothing funny about this book. It is not warped or jadedly comical, it is downright disgusting. The author obviously has no talent for him to concentrate his wasted energy on penning a book on animal torture and cruelty. This book is dispicable and disturbing with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I can't believe it was even published - and yet by a company which publishes ""real"" books on art and photography. Shame on them, too. Save your money and your time - avoid this book. You'll thank me for it."
1,"Pigeons are beautiful, peaceful birds.","Shame on the author! People are brainwashed by what authorities and pest controllers say about pigeons such as diseases and calling them rats with wings. Not very nice!Although I have never read the book, I am turned off by its review contents. Pigeons are beautiful birds (just like doves) and have a right to exist on this planet earth. Doesn't the author realize that pigeons brings life to otherwise a bleak urban landscape? They provide tranquility for us city dwellar who want to escape the rat race of the big city once in a while."
5,great book,"this is one of the great books available the sport of boxing.whether you are a casual fan,or the true afficionado this book is a must.filled with great photos,great bios,and recaps of some of the greatest bouts ever fought.one of the best things about this book is that the info is right there for you to compare the modern day ""pound for pound"" best and compare them with the best of all time.the sad part is that you will also see that boxing has degenerated to the point where a ""champion""is rarely what would be a champion by the standards of the days gone by."
4,Entertaining and facinating piece of sports history.,"The book was very good. I did however miss some names that definetley should have been there like Jess Willard, Tim Witherspoon, Ken Norton, Kevin Kelley and Ray Mercer."
5,Wonderful and Worthwhile,"If you wish you liked this Mozart opera better, or if you always loved this opera and appreciate new insights , this is a dvd to watch. The voices are splendid . (Paul Groves, a marvelous tenor from Louisiana proves that Opera is still a part of that states great musical heritage).Colorful perfection in the costumes and sets creates absolutely stunning visuals."
2,These Spring rolls are made with a weird tasting sauce!,"I guess I was looking for steak and cheese spring rolls but these did not have any cheese flavoring. Instead, they applied this awful sauce that ruined the whole roll. Don't get me wrong, the meat was tender and delicious but as a complete package....goodness that sauce ruined the whole taste experience. I won't be buying this particular product ever again but you may like the taste of this sauce so....give it a try once, like I did!"
2,Way too biased,"I am currently taking a grad school course of Sports Ethics and we are using this book as a text. Coakley begins each chapter well using differnt socialogcal schools of thought as a basis for defining the each issue that is presented chapter by chapter. However, the second half of each chapter turns into his own personal treatise on what is wrong with sports in today's society. Although I do commend Coakley on having the guts to let his view be known, I don't feel for a book that is used as a text he presents the argument equally well on each subject."
4,Sociology in Sports,"This book was in decent condition and arrived in a timely mannner. I would order from this seller again. For a two dollar book, I was very pleased."
5,UNIQUE,A unique(only) record(disk) - Elisabeth Verlooy is the most beautiful voice(vote) which I have was able to listen to there and Lucia's air(sight) is immense - never a version is the also perfect and similar for all this merveillieux compact disc - Christian (France)
3,Good choice for novices,"After stumbling acorss Cradle of Filth, I became a metal fanatic. I bought this CD because I wanted learn about the different bands, and I was not disappointed. While many of the songs didn't do it for me, there were several tracks that are among my favorites today, especially Hecate Enthroned's ""Spell of the Winter Forest"". They are now one of my favorite bands, as well as Emperor (""Thus Spake..."" is excellent), Lord Belial, Diabolical Masquerade, Enslaved and Old Man's Child. If you already know about these bands then this CD is not for you. But if you are just starting out I do recommend the entire Blackend series."
2,Missing in Action,"The book did not give you tips on the special missions or much on car setup. The only thing of use was the car and prize check off list, but there is no information on Peugeot's Cars anywhere in the book."
5,Very WELL Done,"It is a shame no one is going to hear this cd....It's really Good. Like her 1994 Cd ""Well"", Sagal has a most interesting group of songs that well worth the price of the cd. Shame well quality music goes unheard, Britany tops the charts........"
5,Peggy Bundy...who knew she could sing!!,"Wow...I always associated Katey Sagal with Peggy Bundy, and even when she's out of character, just seeing her name makes me think, ""Peggy Bundy,"" which probably isn't the best image to portray. Anyhow, Peggy Bundy...which is the ultimate symbol of the achievement of feminism, is a heroic character based on her refusal to cooperate and submit to the demands of her husband.Since I always believed that Katey Sagal was Peggy Bundy, I didn't know that she could do anything other than act silly (which is definitely a talent). Anyhow, this CD sounds very good...I would say that she's right up there with some of the leading singers of today (e.g. Carrie Underwood, Faith Hill, etc.) and the music is a cross between popular and country, which creates almost a country-rock feel (very nice). An enjoyable CD, easy listening, and a good addition to your collection."
2,Reality Check,"I always laugh when I see a mediocre CD/album-release (such as this) that gets all 5 stars from ""reviewers"". Boston, Thriller, Eagle's greatest hits, Best of Billy Joel, etc. are 5 star releases. Unless you are a hard-core Katey Sagal music fan, I would recommend that you listen to clips before you buy. Don't get me wrong, Ms. Sagal puts her heart and soul into every song, its just that she is a good (but not great) singer and her music suffers from so-so writing. I think Katey Sagal would have more success if she recorded some classic pop/rock songs."
1,Broke after 3 uses,It no longer allows me to select a size for each slice of cheese. It is also hard to remove cheese from device since it clenches onto the very end of it.
2,Difficult to use- buy somthing different,"I bought this cheese slicer because I like very thinly sliced cheese to eat on crackers. Often I'm attempting to cut fairly soft cheese such as an inexpensive medium cheddar. The people who have already rated this for hard cheeses say that it crumbles the end of every slice, and mention it might work better on soft cheese - WELL - it doesn't. Basically the cheddar sticks to the flat surface of the slicer as you try to slice and makes it very difficult. It also breaks off large chunks at the end of every slice (thicker than the width you're slicing). I highly recommend a cheese knife like this one instead - I used one at a friend's home and its AMAZING: Kuchenprofi Parma Cheese Knife in 18/10 Stainless Steel (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000C8T6U/ref=ox_sc_act_title_8?ie=UTF8&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER)"
2,Almost worthless. A little slicing then just breaks the cheese.,"We had an adjustible wire slicer for a long time that just wore out. First we tried another adjustible wire, which did not work - the wire kept coming loose. So we tried this Zyliss, thinking its different design would work. But this slicer just slices for 3 quarters of the way and then breaks the rest of the cheese off in chunks. Dialing the blade does nothing to change the performance. I'm disappointed and am going to look for another wire type slicer."
1,Might work for the softest cheeses...,"This slicer was terrible when trying to slice a block of colby-jack cheese. Setting it between the thinnest and thickest setting resulted in virtually no difference in the thickness of the slice, and either way you can only get one slice of cheese before the cutting area becomes clogged (it doesn't really ""cut"", it kind of drags along the cheese like a wood plane. You end up with a kind of curl of cheese). I even tried it a second time to be sure, but after two attempts, it went back to the store."
2,Save your money...,"For the price, you are much better off with an adjustable wire slicer. Even the thickest setting is so thin that the slice is paper thin. Forget that grilled cheese sandwich, unless you start early! Even medium-bodied cheeses, like Pinconning, break as you slice through. Not just the lag at the end break, either. Big chunks out of the edge of the brick. Fairly useless, waste of money."
2,Crumbles the end of every slice,"Like some of the other reviews here, I found that it slices okay until you get to the end of your block of cheese, then it crumbles and breaks off chunks. And then it's not easy to get the chunks out of the blade. The variations in slicing thickness is a nice idea, but I don't care too much about that, I just want something that cuts thin slices of cheese smoothly, without tearing up my block of cheese."
2,For the true fan,"This album is worth getting only if you are a true fan,like myself. The best song is ""The look of love"". other than that it's a just a collectable. I just wish i could get ""dindi""on c.d."
4,One of the best.....,"Originally, I purchased this album in the early 70's and I have been searching for it on CD for years. Willie Bobo's rendition of ""Yellow Days"" is true to form. His remakes of this Guy's in love and the look of love capture the latin flair. I rate him right under Jobim the master himself!!!"
5,"As always, a terrific read","Previously published as two separate novels, so not new.Have just re-read them, and am very pleased to report they are as terrific as I remember them."
5,Cordelia is my hero,"I loved this book from the first time I read it to the tenth time I re-read it over the years. Cordelia comes alive in Bujold's hands. While the events might be too much to make believeable in most authors hands, here you cheer for Cordelia. From the matter of fact treatment of sexual knowledge to the practical use of future technology, Cordelia's refreshing views on the world of Barrayar shine as a light for our times as well. There is plenty of action, and the book moves rapidly along, so you wish immediatly to go get more Bujold when the plot is concluded. Enjoy!"
2,Don't bother reading,This book may have won a Hugo award but that doesn't mean its good. This book is actually a romance novel.
1,"Reprint of ""Shards of Honor"" & ""Barrayar """,This is a reprint of two books I have read. I will probabaly return it.
2,Practically nauseating,"I was so fooled by all the reviews of this author. Come on Hugo and Nebula award voters! This is terrible! This is not science fiction, well its half right, it is fiction but it has no science. This a romantic fiction story disguised by a few lazer guns. Mind you, these guns are rarely used. I figured they gave this writer those awards simply because a woman writing (or attempting) a science fiction story is a rare beast. She writes smarmy interactions and does her best to pose characters with flaws but even their flaws are endearing.Yuk!"
5,Terrific intro to this author and the Vorkosigan series,"It has been many years since I was a serious SciFi reader and this series is just the way to make the jump back into space. Cordelia is a wonderful, brave, intelligent and insightful character and the author has drawn her really well. I enjoyed every moment of these 2 books and look forward to the adventures of Cordelia and Aral's son Miles Vorkosigan. This is one really good writer giving you a look at humanity from several viewpoints."
3,Good space opera,"Definitely not hard sci-fi a la Vernor Vinge or even Larry Niven, but still a good space opera. It's a refreshing change to have strong women in science fiction novels, and Cordelia qualifies as an exceptionally strong and sympathetic protagonist.Bujold also confronts the issues of rape and torture that inhabit war's dark underbelly. She does so indirectly and without resorting to graphic scenes of voyeuristic torture, but it is nice to see these issues dealt with soberly rather than ignored as they are in many of the sci-fi and fantasy novels I've read.One downside of reading too much anthropology is that I get annoyed when sci-fi shows and novels reduce all the civilizations of an entire planet to a few simple characteristics (Klingons are warlike, Vulcans are logical, Endor is a ""forest"" moon that evidently doesn't have any other ecosystems, etc). This novel is guilty of this, although Barrayar, the civilization that the reader gets the closest look at, is fairly interesting."
5,"Character-driven, Well-written SciFi","What a concept! What I personally look for in books is a character-driven plot, combined with the author's ability to string words together in a comprehensible, yet elegant way. And Bujold *definitely* fulfills these requirements. Her language is accessible to just about everyone, and her characters are well fleshed out and three dimensional.It is really easy to love this book, because it's really easy to love the characters. Cordelia is the epitome of a genre strong woman (imagine a scifi version of Mercedes Lackey/Tanya Huff/Laurell K Hamilton heroines), and Aral makes a wonderful counterpoint in this story.Despite my rather strong inclinations towards fantasy rather than scifi, this book hooked me in, and continues to keep a firm hold on me. One of those books you start reading, and before you know it, it's 5am and you have to get up in two hours for work. *sigh*.Definitely a keeper!"
1,Crappy copy,"This is my favorite book. It was surprise to find this is a size LARGE paperback. okay.. no problem, though unexpected. A few pages are torn and the condition of it is downright shoddy. I'm disappointed and can't wait to find a nicer copy for my collection. Bumm-er."
2,More romance than sci-fi,Not impressed. It's a quick read and I would not recommend it to hard sci-fi or space opera fans because it lacks high tech imagery and multiple plot lines. It is a wholesome love story between two heroic characters who must fight the odds to be together.
2,"Perhaps a good novella, but definitely not sci-fi","This book was a disappointment. Billed as a sci-fi, the reader is immediately fooled into expecting some swashbuckling futuristic action in the first few pages. This quickly falls apart, however, as the book finds its own in talking about character relationships on a planet that resembles present-day Earth in every way. Prepare for endless pages on horseback riding, formal events, romance, balls, feminism, and a wedding. Dozens of pages are devoted to each topic.And the book does well with its stride. Characters have some depth to them, the world presented feels real enough. The storyline is consistent and well-presented. Were this billed as a present-day (or even knights or fantasy) story, it would have been a hit with its target audience. As it stands here, ""Cordelia's Honor"" just doesn't cut it as science fiction."
1,Tell me how you're really feeling!,"OMG - Barrayar is literally the worst book I've ever read. Halfway through Shards of Honor, I suspected the author was a woman. Halfway through Barrayar, I was convinced the author was a sexist man writing what he thought would be a woman's perspective. I mean, if I were to write a book mocking the 'stereotypical woman,' I would basically write Barrayar. The protagonist sits in a house all day long every day and really only gets involved in the exciting events of the outside world by going from room to room asking the actual participants how they are feeling. When not playing therapist, she spends her time waxing maternal, playing matchmaker, and noticing her husband's flashing eyes. I'm not making this up.I'm on book 7 of the Vorkosigan Saga. It has its ups and its downs, this is definitely a down. Unfortunately, it's basically required reading for the next book."
2,Where is the Sci Fi?,"Bujold has a strong following among sci fi readers for good writing and Cordelia's Honor demonstrates why. The writing is strong, the characters, if sometimes more carictures than characters are distinctive.Unfortunately, the sci fi is missing. Yes, there is a gloss of other worlds, disruptor rays and stunners and faster-than-light travel, but these elements are incidental to both books. Take them away, put Barrayar and Beta on two continents on opposite sides of the world (or, rename them Sparta and Athens) and you can write the same book.Classify this work as a political thriller with a sci fi gloss. Worth a solid 3 stars for the writing, but only 1-2 stars as a work of sci fi."
1,"Defective product, do not buy","I brought this product and it broke after using it only a few times. When it broke in half, there wasn't even a drink in the cup holder. Another mommy who was with me informed me that her cup holder broke in the exact same spot after only using it a couple of times. I contacted the company only to inform that this is a discountinued item. If the company does not even stand behind their product, there is no reason for a consumer to buy it. If I could give it 0 out of 5 stars, I would."
1,Spilled drink!,"This seems like a great idea for strollers without cupholder. However, after using it a few times, the clip came apart and of course the drink and cup fell. My husband was with me and managed to put it force the clip portion back together, but I'm not going to trust it! Looking for my receipt so I can return it to store!"
4,Brian Micheal Bendis at his best,"this starts off a pretty great book and ends a great book. we first see spider-man in the first issue and he brings humor to the story, then we see daredevil who brings a real seriousness to the story while characterizing Wolverine at the same time. The last 3 issues are the best and when i see Jean's new character i immediately fall in love with her because she no longer looks ugly. As always the art from David Finch is amazing. To understand the ending of the book you HAVE to read the next volume New Mutants."
5,Ultimate x men still great.,Ultimate x men continues to deliver great story with original ideas. The Ultimate X men idea was a great one. Uncanny X men and other Marvel titles have run for so long it is hard for younger new readers to pick it up. They often fill lost and left out. With the Ultimate titles there is now a place to go. In Ultimate X men they recreate some of the best characters in the X men franchise and finds new ways to tell their stories. WARNING the Ultimate titles do NOT follow traditional marvel story lines. But to me that's what makes it so great. I highly recommend to anyone to pick up the Ultimate X men series.
3,Fair but could have been much better,"it was a fair story story though from the cover i expected more daredevil than the little we seen, he never even gets to do more than throw his stick a couple of times, spidey kind of leaves before the end of the story too.at least for once bendis didn't skip the action, in fact it's pretty much nothing but action from the third page where wolvie gets blasted.spidey is played a little too dumb here i think, yeah i know he's a rookie but DD or wolvie are having to get him out of harms way a lot and he does not listen well.fair read and I have skipped the rest of the ultimate x-men since i don't care a bit about them after having read the first 26 issues and dropping the book, seeing them coem in near the end showed me why, oh well i still have the trades coming out of the older claremont x-men to fall back on :"
5,The Machine,"This is a metal-bound (tin and galvanized steel) book that was published by the Museum of Modern Art of New York in 1968. It's mostly about how the mechanical age of machinery has affected our view of the world and how many artists have responded to modern life with machines. While I purchased a mint condition version of this edition it might be just as appropriate to find a dented and rusted version, depicting the eventuality of all decomposing things. It's a wonderful forty year old look at our modern age and has a ""futurama"" feel to its contents and will give art lovers an enjoyable look back at many pieces of mid-century, Modern Art that we still cherish today (Alexander Calder mobiles, for example)"
1,shower of blood,Horrible. I couldn't understand any of it' the acting was terrible! Just another skin flick. I wouldn't recommend to anyone.
5,Visually inspiring.,"This book is a culmination of all that makes us part of the earth. The beauty that The American Indian sees is one of pure refinement and Mother Nature content. This book recently inspired a twelve-year old to paint, in an expression of renaissance art, for a history project at Malibu. High School. The picture is Crooked River, Maine (photographed by Willard Clay)."
4,St. john Bosco: mission to love,This is a great portrait of a man and saint. The story of John Bosco and his life shows how he was inspired to work with the poor and needy of Turin in the 1800's. This movie is a great way to tell his story.
5,Touched,This is not what I expected...I didn't expect to get touched the way I did when I watched it on EWTN today (11/3/2007). I'm buying it right away so I can show everyone else...absolutely beautiful movie... a tear jerker for sure.
2,steer clear of this one; not worth your money,"This was the first UDK training video I purchased and so far it is the only one that has truly disappointed me. The Gnomon Workshop and the free videos on UDK's web site are orders of magnitude better.The main problem I have with it is that 90% of it covers basic brush and mesh setup: turn this, move that, scale this, and rotate that. After about ten minutes a beginner gets the idea and wishes to learn more about the rest of the features of UDK but that never happens.The following are either touched upon extremely briefly or not covered at all: scripting and Kismet, cinematics and Matinee, fractured static meshes, crowds, fluid surfaces, terrain, geometry mode, particle effects, physics, sound, lighting and materials, creating game UI, the UDK UI with all of the above (buttons, menus, shortcuts etc).Even if it was free you would still just be wasting your time with it."
2,Disappointing,"Since the title is ""7 Simple Steps"" I thought the book would offer a clear, specific program for getting organized. Instead, it's more of a general advice book for overall self-improvement. The first chapter, for example, is about losing weight and getting in shape, and the advice is frustratingly familiar. Eat lowfat foods, exercise every day, etc. etc. There's not much in this book that the average reader of women's magazine won't already know."
5,Great Collection,Excellent collection of songs. I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes traditional rock and roll. My only regret is I never saw Dave perform when he was on the tour.
2,Not for me.,"I am writing this of course from my perspective and taste. I don't like to advise people on what to buy and what not to buy. The next person may love this cd, but I didn't. I am a classic rock and rockabilly fan and thought I would like it. Dave's sound is hollow and ordinary. I tried listening to it several times and it didn't help. The material is just not that good and neither is the delivery."
3,You can do better than this odd lot,"Dave Edmunds was a fine songwriter and a capable interpreter of rockabilly classics, but this hodgepodge really doesn't do him justice. A single-disc best-of assortment is easy to assemble from The Dave Edmund Anthology (which I recommend), but beyond his excellent original hits (about half of this album), most people will have little interest in listening to lackluster covers, movie tracks, and Christmas music."
3,"A weird, luke-warm collection","Dave Edmunds is a great player who had a number of strong cuts, but like an earlier reviewer said, you're better served by assembling your own disc from the Dave Edmunds Anthology. My big wish would be for every cut that Dave Edmunds self-produced to be re-engineered. I find most of his vocal parts mixed way, way too nasal. For all that, at the same time, I find it impossible to stop shakin', movin' & groovin' to his late 70's-mid 80's work, and I think I'm going to dig out my Rockpile bootleg as soon as I'm done here."
5,An Excellent introduction to Heidgger's thinking about Technology,"This is an essential series of lectures to understand the importance of science and specifically of Leibniz's principle of sufficient reason in Heidegger's later thought. It provides the basis for any inquiry into technology which, in Heidegger's thought, is the latest development of scientific metaphysics. It is also the basis for recent studies of law like Roger Berkowitz's The Gift of Science: Leibniz and the Modern Legal Tradition."
5,The great philosophy.,"The book entitled ""Psychoneuroimmunopathology and Daseinsanalysis"" is to be published and to be available in Amazon.com. The studies in the book was referred his philosophy. I felt he is the greatest philosophist."
5,Fun toy,"It is really fun because you can get a kid and take care of it till it grows up, then you go onto the next generation. It is also really cool because you can take it on car rides and different places.It has a pause button so it wont get sick or die while you have to leave it. It is pretty durable because i have dropped it on the floor alot and its still in good condition the only thing is the screen scratches pretty easily."
4,Learning to take care of an electronic baby that grows into an adult.,"We have fun playing with our electronic toy that teaches us responsibility in taking care of an electronic pet from a baby into an adult. If you don't take care of it, it will die. You have to reset the game to start over again, but you never know if it is going to be a girl or a boy the next time around. This Tamagotchi can connect with other Tamagotchi's and give them give gifts (good or bad). If it gives a bad one, you have to give it time out. I recommend this toy to anyone over the age of 7. They will have a good time in takening care of this toy."
2,"Nice, but not strong",The harness was great for the first day. I had left it on my 6 month old puppy the following day only to find she had chewed straight through the strap that goes under the belly from the neck to the waist. The material needs to be made of a stronger fiber which cannot be so easily destroyed by the teeth of a teething and curious puppy. I had to throw the entire harness away as it would not longer stay straight on her body. What a waste!
5,Love this harness!,"We have a Lupine leash which we love, and bought this harness when our puppy got big enough for it. We love it - it's stylish, fits well, and goes through the wash and comes out looking like new. It seems to be very comfortable on our dog, and we like that we're not pulling her neck when we take her out. We have one in the butterfly pattern as well, but this sea glass pattern is our absolute favorite. Lupine products are guaranteed for life, and we know people who have sent them back after years of use and had no problems getting a replacement."
1,No hardware and have not heard from the vendor....,"The mirror is nice quality. I would have given this a much better rating (at least 4 stars). However, I was surprised it did not come with hardware to hang the mirror. I contacted the vendor to see if it should have come with hardware -- but, I have received no response. So between no hardware & the unresponsive vendor, I give this a low rating. I will update review accordingly if I hear back from the vendor."
3,"It could be better, could be worse...I guess","Well, I guess I'm not too suprised buy the quality, but gee whiz the prints used here are pretty banged up...Other than that complaint, you'll get what the product advertises. I've always had a fondness for this type of thing so I guess I might be a little more forgiving than the product deserves. At any rate this product delivers on it's promise of dancing buxom beauties.Oh, wait, I do have another complaint; the music is totally awful. I dont know why they didnt use something a little more burlesque, but you can always mute it..."
4,surrender in silk,i enjoy anything from Ms.Mallory. I feel that i become part of the story. There are real life issues that she writes about.
5,Classic,This is one of our books that I will keep forever. It is one of our favorites. No matter how old my girls get they still love to read this one.
5,Great bedtime story,"We all love this bedtime story and I haven't tired of reading it after a year or more. My son and daughter, both 4, recently started asking for it again after a short break. They love to guess ""who will be next"" to go to sleep in the big feather bed. A great gift for any young child."
5,A must have good night book,"This book was given to our family as a present and immediately became a favorite. The mother bear tells each of her cubs a story in rhyme as each goes to bed. Each story is tailored for the personality of each bear and sends them off to dreamland with happy thoughts. I like how it shows my daughter all the types of fun adventures she can have as she dreams. Not too long, but has some substance. This book is one of my favorite to read to her and a good choice for birthday presents."
3,Good for 1 bedtime read by a 3 year old boy,"My son paid attention and it was a good bedtime read. But, he didnt want to hear it again a few days later."
2,Sibling rivaltry between sisters or . . . ?,"This book preports to give the ""real"" biography of Roseanne Barr, and it is colorful indeed. Still, one wonders about the author's (her sister, Geraldine's) credibility since much of the text is presented in a negative light that highlights Barr's faults. The passages on Barr's accusations of childhood sexual abuse are intriguing and raise skepticism; but overall, the book has a whiney, defensive tone coming from a sister who was suprisingly and, in her view, unjustly fired as Barr's agent/promoter. More info about the development and execution of the popular ""Roseanne"" television show would have been interesting. In my opinion, the writing in this book is much too padded and reads a bit like a gossip tabloid."
3,Roseanne Barr's Sister,I have read a lot of books trying to figure out the comedic genius of Roseanne Barr and this one did not assist me in my goal. It was well-written but lacked that certain something that you feel when you are being told the truth. I also read Roseanne Barr's book and felt the same way. My suspicion is that the two of them wrote Roseanne's act together UNLIKE each of them taking full credit in their books.
1,Not Worth Your Time,"If you were to total all the interesting parts of this book, you'd come up with about thirty pages. Mostly, it chronicles how Roseanne Barr went off her rocker when she got involved with Tom Arnold and then, with the aid of false memory syndrome, betrayed her family. If you have a lot of patience and don't mind reading the same thing over and over couched in different (yet still unlyrical) language, then it might entertain you just for the dirt it gives on a major celebrity."
4,"Invaluable portrait of ""self will run riot""","This book is an invaluable portrait of Roseanne and her family, and how her family coped with Roseanne's sexual abuse allegations against her father in the early 1990s. It is also, primarily, the story of sisters, who worked together to create a successful business (Roseanne's career) and how the relationship came apart when Roseanne became a household name. On one level the book is not without its flaws: it is overwritten and at times repetitive. However, these flaws are balanced by the author's mostly successful attempts to present all sides of the story in straight-forward prose. Geraldine Barr is as candid discussing her own shortcomings -- and those of her family -- as she is in discussing Roseanne's and, as a result, the book emerges as a cut above the average tell-all memoir. That the Barr family seemed to become a closer unit in the wake of Roseanne's abuse allegations is the real story here."
5,It's been said she knocks 'em dead...,"It's worth the full price of the entire album just to hear her sing ""Sweet Georgia Brown."" No one else can ever sing it like her, they should have retired the song after she recorded it. Plus the arrangement is fantastic.I also love that wig she's wearing on the cover."
3,on Einhard's The Life of Charlemagne,"I read the book through in one sitting. It was, actually, not particularly well written, as though the writer were not overly familiar with and skilled in his craft. I viewed it as a small insight, from a seemingly personal level into the life of an historical figure about whom I really did not know very much. From that increase in my knowledge, I give it a 3-star rating. But for that increase in my knowledge, the rating would have been lower."
5,Rocky Horror Fans Must Have!,I have been a dedicated RHPS fan for years and didn't realize what I DIDN'T know about the history! Awesome. Thanks!
3,Nonsense questions,"Has questions in it not pertaining to Rocky at all.Also has quite a few questions that are WRONG, such as:What was Tim Curry's character's name in Clue?It was Wadsworth though they do not even give that as a choice and instead they say it is ""Little Nell"".What??!!Considering how much a shelled out for this game you think they could actually do their research."
5,Pretty cool,"It was awesome by the way do not pause it too much, it stunts the growth of your tamagotchi"
5,Info on this toy,"I recieved This exact tama, With my own money,,ok January 4th it was in stock in Amazon, at 9:00 am in my time, Then at 12:00,,,,,IT WAS OUT OF STOCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was good That i could order it..I CANT WAIT TO GET IT!!! It took me about 2 weeks to find one in stock..Its mostly luck to order/find one v2.. Good luck!"
1,ok....,"this toy was horrible, a babyish toy and i think only 5 year-olds will have fun with this. it was so irritating and i couldn't find the intructions and their a ripe-off and it wastes your money and it really doesn't teach you anything. i don't like it and i am only a third grader. i hope this will open up your minds up to the truth."
5,"Gripping, thought-provoking novels!!",Both are incredible stories that hold you until the very end!! They also convince you of the power of the Lord and truely convict you to pray!!!
5,"Great book, but dont turn it into your guide!","I was totally hooked when reading this book, and it was very entertaining endeed. Even though the spiritual warfare around us daily, and the power of prayer is very real, I sure hope people dont take this book as total spiritual truth and total theological correctness. REMEMBER-- This book is a FICTION novel BASED on real spiritual facts! Do not let it confuse you in some of the details... The real guide for our lives and what you should base your beliefs in is the Holy Bible! Keep christian fiction books for what they are made for: entertainment!"
5,Awesome. A must read,"This book was awesome and it is a must read for anybody wanting a deeper understanding of the Spirit realm. It is fiction but that doesnt matter, the writer did a wonderful job capturing the realities of Spiritual warfare."
3,Good fiction... horrid theology,"I enjoyed the book but as a Christian who cares about thebible, I was shocked by the theology of this book. It has almostnothing to do with the bible, yet people seem to take it seriously. I strongly caution Christians (especially new ones) when reading this book. I also encourage non-Christians to lean what real theologians believe."
2,Spiritual Hollywood,"It's a little too unrealistic for me. Satan and his demons were once angels in heaven. Why does the auther deplict them as dragons of folklore and hollywood monsters? The Bible says ""Satan comes disguised as a messenger of light"" and to ""test the spirits"" so deplicting demons as monsters turned my pages closed. This would make a good ""Hollywood Horror Film"". If your into that stuff, enjoy this book."
1,What hogwash!,"Is this guy nuts? I didn't know that Christians believed in yellow-eyed, sulfur-spewing demons! And how in the world could he depict proponents of Universal Love to be the bad guys! This is the first book that I will throw away. I won't even donate it to a thrift shop lest some poor soul will waste money on it- even at 25 cents."
5,Great purchase,"I love these books! It's great having them in one edition, and hardback at that. This was a great purchase."
5,"Unseen warfare, the battle for souls","These books were a revelation at the time they were written. Many christians ""woke up"" to how serious this battle really is. Unfortunately, like everything else, the fire died, and christians became slothful, lazy, and lost the fire. We forgot that before these books were even wrote, the holy scriptures talked about the unseen war thousands of years ago. These books were a serious wake up call to a sleeping church. Peretti, was inspired I believe to write these books. He was anointed by the Holy Spirit to give us a shot in the arm. These books did just that, at the time. Now, at this present time, in this present darkness, we are faced with a horrifying tragedy at New York City. Sadly, it took that display of raw, satanic, destruction, to unite the White House, the people of America, and the churches. To me that is REALLY sad. God bless him for writing these books, thankyou Frank, there hasn't been books like those since."
5,fascinating and a Real Education about Spiritual Warfare,"These two books a compelling page-turners, but also teach the reader a lot about demonic warfare and how to fight in the Heavenly battle. I read them both in a matter of days."
5,Awesome,"On time, and worth it! A whole new way to see conflict, and if you don't believe in spiritual things now..........you will."
4,A quick reference of Beble Scriptures.,"This book is filled with Bible Scriptures for every situation or trial that you maybe facing. I have found it helpful in my prayer life, praying for my own needs and other people."
5,Great book,"I love this book, Joyce Meyer is a wonderful writter and speaker. She is a true Christian and I love her encouragement. She helps resolve issues of everyday life and helps to teach me solutions through God's Word."
4,Quick reference,This is a nice pocket reference of God's word applied to circumstances. Nice to have with you.
5,The Best Book for Success & Happiness,"I've used this book over and over again, have shared it with others, and have bought several for friends and acquaintances because they tried to take mine. I highly recommend it. It has helped me through so much...and I've come out on top!"
5,So User Friendly!!!!,This is one of my favorite books! My first copy was a gift. I purchased an extra so I am never without in case my hubby takes one on the road with him! We LOVE Joyce Meyer!!! This book is so easy. You can access scripture you need immediately since it is separated by catagory! Enjoy!
4,Excellent reference for those on the go,"I think this is a really good book for those who don't necessary have alot of time to sit down and read the word. You can pick one scripture and focus on it all day. It's really compact so you can put it in your pocketbook or bookbag or whatever and read it on the train or bus on your way to work. The only thing I don't like about this book is, she uses more than one type of Bible. I think she needs to stick to the (King James Version), I know it might be difficult for some people to understand, but it's the version that has not been changed."
5,Joyce Did All The Work,"This is a very handy little book, it has a great deal of scripture that will help you to stay focused on God's plan for your life. Joyce Meyer is my favorite teacher, she goes above and beyond to help us all."
5,Armed with power!,This is a very present help in time of trouble and an excellent book to have so you can eat the Word for daily strength and reinforcement. I bought this book for several of my family members and friends. The Word is powerful!
4,Coby TFT Portable DVD Player,"I found this item most rewarding when I placed the DVD of pictures from the Grandchildren into the player. I found the quality of the pictures very good. Later I flew to Maine and PEI Canada on vacation. The movies I played while on the flight helped the time fly as well. The weight of the player, the battery life before charging was 4 hours plus, and the ease of using the player was great. The sound varies with the quality of the DVD but was excellent when used with the TV system. I would recommend this to anyone feeling queasy with electronics as it is a DVD Player for Dummies."
2,"Product may be good if it works, but customer service horrible!","I ordered this from Amazon in July and when we took our first trip with it a couple of weeks later, were very disappointed to find out that the unit did not hold a charge (even though we were careful to charge it properly the first time). We tried several more times to discharge and recharge it, but the unit was defective. I called Amazon, who told us to return it to Coby and thats where the real problems started. We returned it in August and still have not received a repaired unit in return. Every time I contact Coby they are very disorganized and unhelpful. I could not recommend any Coby product based on my experience with their customer service (or lack thereof). I gave the unit two stars because it seemed like if it had worked it may have been great. The size and screen quality were great, but a portable unit made for traveling needs to be able to hold a charge more than 10 minutes."
2,Coby TF-DVD7333 panned by the critics,"We sent this DVD player back. The controls were unreliable, the player kept freezing."
2,"Great to begin with, but didn't last","The grandchildren loved this when I first got it, and so did I as it kept them happy in the car, but after only limited use it started skipping and stopping. I'd actually had it for over a year, but hadn't used it much as there weren't all that many opportunities so I was very disappointed to discover on a long car trip when I really needed it that it wasn't interested in playing the many movies we brought along for entertainment. It would play parts of the movies, or perhaps the special features, but apparently, the read head had lost its ability to operate smoothly all the way through the disk. Unfortunately, the warranty period was past, so I was out of luck. I'll be more careful in making my next choice."
2,Dissapointed,"When this first arrived, I was so excited. Great quality, nice looking at an excellent price. However, I think the great price in this case, isn't worth it. After watching just 2 DVD's, the player stopped working.I am sending it to customer service for repair; hopefully the service will be better than the overall quality."
2,Great for two months,"I purchased this about 2.5 months ago. When I first got it all was great, I enjoyed taking it to the laundry room, kitchen, bedroom. But after about 2 months any DVD I put in would get stuck at some point. I thought it might be because some were library DVDs but they were fine on our Sony DVD player, same with the DVDs that we own. Now we can't seem to be able to play any DVDs on it without it stopping at some point."
4,Dragging,I really love reading her books but I just finished reading Season of Storms last evening and I felt that the book seemed to drag all the way through and she was not really enthusiastic about writing this book except to add pages instead of plot. Not enough depth to it unlike her other books!
4,You can't go wrong with Susanna Kearsley,"I read this book while I had a bad cold and needed a good, comforting read to carry me over. Season of Storms was just the kind of book that got me through that. The historical element of this book is not as strong as in, say Mariana or Sophia's Secret, and the ""mystery"" that takes place in the past is a little predictable, but the modern-day story more than made up for that. There's a mystery and some ghosts in the modern-day story, and I really enjoyed the suspense and the hint of something supernatural that seems to haunt the second Celia. The characters of this book are also well-formed and fully realized, although the second Celia seemed a lot older than her twenty-two years sometimes.I was also fully able to appreciate the setting of this novel, too--I went to Italy in 2004, and one of the places I visited was Lake Garda and the town of Sirmione. Both are just as beautiful in real life as they're described in this novel."
2,Well . . .,"Although I am a big fan of Ms. Kearsley and her books, this one just didn't grab me the way the others have. I plowed through it anyway, simply because I wanted to give the book a chance. When I had finally finished it, I was happy because the chore was done! Kearsley's other books are much better, especially her first, ""Marianna""."
5,Well worth it,"Man...it was great to see Amos. There is so much practical advice contained within this DVD, that any serious player must consider it for their reference library. Amos goes beyond the licks and into the theory of what he does. He pulls no punches and lays it all on the line. He even demonstrates how to string your guitar to eliminate the stretching that would otherwise occur with the deep bends he demos. Thoroughly informative."
2,"Cool idea, but BORING","I love games that let me control superheroes, but the game play here is just boring, and the storyline is weak. There is no real strategy or skill to the fighting other than wailing around on the buttons until the bad guys die. You would think that the make-up of your team would have some sort of impact on the outcome, but the only real reason I could see for picking particular characters was to live out your own fantasy of having superpowers.I wouldn't waste the money. They should have thrown this in for free."
2,Picture reviews made it look alot more cooler then it really is,"players are so tiny, not what i expected. its cool that u can be a lot of different super heros, but I like when its just one player on the screen showing his powers, not 3 superheros on a tiny screen trying to finish a board going through a ton of villians.my opinion.."
2,kids game,The graphics weren't really that great. Reminded me of PS1. This game is more for little children.
2,"The game itself is good, the game on this system is not.","I played this on my friend's 360 and then on my own Playstation 3. (I confess that I'm a Playstation fan -- bought the PS1, PS2, and now the PS3.)The frame rate and color depth on the PS3 version are pretty depressing in comparison to the 360 version. Sure, it's a simple little game; jump around and hack and slash or use your specials. It's a mindless sort of fun. Simple. But you'd think they could do more with a $600 system and such a ""simple"" game. It's not like it's using photo-realistic graphics or anything, and yet... I feel like I'm using a really slow computer to play a really graphically enhanced game. Needless to say, I feel very let down. The game itself is good, the game on this system is not.At least I still have Fight Night..."
3,A game between games!,"I couldn't have said it better myself! This game is lame, I cant stand the camera angles. I ordered it because I knew I wouldnt get the game I wanted to play the same day I got the PS3. I wouldn't recommend spending $60 on it, but if you have nothing else to play, it was fun!"
1,"Without Dr. Doom playable, this game sucks.","This game was an amazing game until xbox 360 got Dr. Doom as a playable character. The greatest hero in the marvel universe should be playable on all systems. Other characters are ok, but the ps3 bump over the ps2 version is mainly graphics. colossus' grab moves are amusing but who the hell cares about moon knight? If people want to play as batman they should buy a DC game rather than settle for the cheeesy marvel knock off version. Overall the game is very fun and I will modify my review to 5 stars the game would otherwise deserve if they come out with Dr. Doom as a playable."
5,Siaxis tilt functions can be turned off,"You can turn off the Sixaxis tilt functions off in the menu options. So, instead of all that tilting junk, you just hit ""triangle, circle, etc."" when prompted.Concerning the game itself. You control four superheroes. One yourself and the other 3 will autofight. You can switch between the four at anytime. Marvel Alliance is a good game. It is like an RPG with superheroes you can level, add add items to, and change outfits (each giving different bonuses).This game is great. Although with Marvel Alliance 2 about to come out, this game's price is about to plummet just like all predecessors of sequels. So, I wouldn't pay too much for it, anything under $20 is okay, because that is where it will wind up."
4,Addictive Button Masher,"I picked this up used for $15 and so far I'm enjoying it more then the X-Men Legends games. There's a lot of variety in the levels, enemies, and combos you string together so the button mashing doesn't get old. Graphics look great in 1080p on my 42"" LCD. Though on some levels I experience a lag in the frame rate. Also there's absolutely no one playing online anymore. But it's still a good game for under $20. Especially if you're into marvel comics."
2,Sub-par,"Neat graphics, fun at first but the battles and fights are all really repetitive. Alot of different characters to play as. Fun but not alot of replay value."
3,"Lots of characters, but no lots of fun.","This game would have been cool on Sega Genesis, but the aimless wandering and pushing buttons until the bad guy is dead got old real fast. Graphics are pretty cool, nothing amazing though. I had trouble picking out Iceman from some of the bad guys, they looked too similar. The save markers are too far apart, if you get pretty far in the level and have to stop you are screwed and forced to play all of that boring level again. I played this game a few times and couldn't take it anymore so I returned it to the video store early. Just rent it, don't bother buying it."
3,Button mashers rejoyce!,"*Sigh* Someday comic-book fans will get a well-thought-out and well-controlled video game, until then, Marvel Ultimate Alliance will have to do. Good selection of playable characters, but abyssmal writing (some of the things these characters say are REAL groaners), choppy camera, and button-mashing controls ruin the fun."
5,Superheroes Assemble!,This is one awesome game where some of everyone's favorite Marvel superheroes come together to save the day! This one is probably my personal all time favorite Marvel game. I recommend it.
2,Save your money!!,"Getting this book is no longer important anymore. With the technology of the internet, the comic book collector can now surf the internet and check out comic book sites for current prices of old comics. With the latest of the stupid CDGing where you have to put comics into a sealable plastic shell so you can't take it out to read.............."
2,"Slow, Safe and Boring","This book was a huge let down. I have been a long time fan who eagerly awaits any JD Robb title. I think this book is the worst in the series so far. There isn't any suspense in this book at all. Nothing was exciting, surprising or unpredictable. In my opinion, the best thing that can be said about this book is that it does provide some background information on Eve and serves as a transitionary story that will lead to hopefully better releases in the future!"
2,boring,"Nora's last three ""In Death"" books have been a disappoint to me. They lack excitement and the spark seems to have gone out.They've got ""no juice"". I hope she isn't getting bored with the series. Hopefully, ""Born..."" will have some of the old chemistry going for it."
4,Decent Read,MY first J.D. Robb book and I found it started out very strong and quick paced. Slowed quite a bit two thirds of the way and the ending was predictable.
2,Soap Opera,"This is the first Nora Roberts book I have read and will probably be the last. There are too many better researched, talented writers of fiction than this writer available. She doesn't hold a candle to Nicholas Sparks, Sue Monk Kidd and Nicholas Evans. She let you know who murdered the victim half way through the book. I just find it more of a ""sex"" read with a little fluff of a plot."
3,All much the same...spoilers included,"I've enjoyed reading this series in the past, particularly the earlier novels, as I found the tension between Roarke and Eve exciting and some of the murders intriguing. However, this entry seems to be particularly formulaic. The villain is a rip-off of at least three other characters in the previous book, someone who appears innocent but in fact is not; Eve's back story is developed to new, Dickensian levels to the point that credulity is stretched; and there's just no reason for the continued bickering between the two main characters. I wouldn't bother with this book unless you are a rabid fan or there's really nothing else at the airport bookstore."
3,Missing Friends,"I enjoyed this book as I do all of J.D. Robb's books. In fact I have given them all 5 stars. However in this book I miss the interaction between Eve and her work mates and friends. Too much wallowing in her own problems and not enough good old fashion police work. There was only the one murder of Eve's foster mother and I really didn't care much about it. Also there were not enough suspects. I figured out ""who done it"" because there was no one else!!! Still it was Eve and Rourke so I will read it again as I do all J.D's books."
2,Worst of series...,"A very disappointing read-laborious, predictable, no interesting plot or characterization. The supporting characters that make Eve such an interesting person and the books such fascinating reads were missing--for a book set during Christmas, this lack was even more apparent. I am a huge fan of this series, and this book was the first that felt like a huge waste of my money. I will wait for the paperback version of the next In Death offering."
2,Sucks,"Eve Dallas is a cop in the future, chasing drug dealers, killer and being a badge heavy bitch in general. Her foster mother shows up and tries to get money out of Eve's rich husband and ends up dead.I hated this book, the characters are all unlikeable and the story drags."
3,Ho-Hum in Death,"Don't get me wrong--I started out a HUGE ""In-Death"" fan. But it seems Nora has lost the edge with this series. Most of the orginal side plots have been worked out--and the loss of Eve's more neurotic behaviors tied to those was what I found enjoyable. It seems like I keep buying these books just to get a few more fragments into Eve's/Roarke's histories--and those are meted out stigily every 3rd book or so. I knew right after the murder ""whodunnit"" and then read 200 pgs of fairly lackluster situations before getting my gold star. Perhaps I have just grown out of the place where I identified with this series, but I can still joyfully reread many of the earlier books."
4,Not so much a mystery but great insight into Eve's evolution as a character,"As a mystery Memory was not her greatest book. I read these books less for the mystery plot but more for the character developement and interactions. I think when you read a ""series"" involving the same characters they become as important as or more important than the actual plot. Eve Dallas has come a long way since Naked in Death. The books are a bit repetitive about her past abuse, etc. but show her evolving personally - she is developing more insight into her interactions and feeling for people around her. A softer side of Eve Dallas showed in this book."
4,"Moving, enjoyable, pain and the recover there from.","This book deals with much of the hidden, hinted at childhood of Eve Dallas. It is a tale of pain and growth and of memories for the good Lieutenant.Roarke and Eve's relationship has its ups, downs and rocky patches and yet its almost as interesting as the mystery. I found the mystery to be a wee bit on the weak side. A little predictable... But not bad at all on the whole.An enjoyable read."
1,J.D. Robb paperbacks,The In Death series is fabulous but the quality of the paperbacks recently has been awful. The pages start falling out during the first read of the book!
4,memory in death in Christmas time,"This was an interesting story blending Eve's past when she was a foster child, blackmail, Christmas celebration, and Eve's work troubles.What I considered interesting was the revelation of Eve's past as a foster child and how CPS failed to help a child in trouble and placed the child with Trudy, who was more of a professional money-collector than professional-mom for foster children.However, fitting to Christmas spirit, everything turns out well for Eve and Roarke, for Peabody and McNabb and all the other important and less important characters in this book. Also, it shows that even if you have had a horrible childhood and have bad memories, you can still turn out to be a good citizen and have a great life when you're grown up."
3,"Original concept, meandering novel.","""Not of this time, Not of this Place"" by Yehudah Amichai is an original novel, which is its only strength. I was captivated nor really feeling anything for Joel, who basically pulls a ""Sliding Doors"" thirty years before the movie. The novel follows a divergence where Joel either stay in Jersusalem and falls in love with an American, or goes back to Germany to revisit old wounds. Joel talks of revenge but only finds sad memory. The love story between Joel and Patricia seems totally unreal."
5,Verve Remix,This is the third time I have puchased this particular CD and HIGHLY recommend it. It takes the classic jazz stylings of the most popular artists in their day and blends it with todays house/dance music. The combination is soulful and catchy. You won't be disappointed!
5,The women LOVE it!,"Look, I don't write reviews...ever! However, I need to get my point across to the men who need a GREAT CD to hit play when it comes the time! I'm, well, someone who likes to impress... Cars, music, food...and slow play! This CD does the trick, believe me! Buy it guys, you will get compliments from which ever girl you have joining you for the night!"
3,great concept - mixed results,"I enjoy this album, more for the mixers and the new product they've created. But don't buy this looking for new twists on the original material because in many cases, the original stuff is all but obliterated. The thought of taking a song such as Strange Fruit and a singer such as Billie Holiday and re-mixing this stuff to a drum bass melange is sort of follhardy to begin with. Her strentgh as a singer was her incredible phrasing and plaintive emotion - all of which is wrung out of this mix. But that's ok as long as you know that going in. Nina Simone fairs better and Summertime remains evocative. It's very cool and bright background music - something to make and eat dinner to. The unmixed version though, is a knock-out sampler of mostly the great female singers on the verve roster. Some of that stuff can bring you to your knees in awe. Get them both and use appropriately."
5,Just the Right Mix!!,"This CD is the definition of what ""jazztronica"" or whatever else it's called should be. This disc should appeal to fans of electronic music, as well as jazz traditionalists. Virtually every track makes you perk up your ears and bob your head along to the music. Tracks of note include ""How Long Has This Been Going On"" and the funkfest of Willie Bobo's ""Spanish Grease."" Kudos also to Verve for selling the ""Verve Unmixed"" CD at such a low price, encouraging people unfamiliar with the originals to get educated."
4,Balance,"It seems that there are three types of people who purchased this CD.1. The Jazz fanatic who ends up hating it because the work is not in tack or the artist vocals where rewroked.2. The uneducated ""Techno"" (Its a genre of edm not a generalization of edm folks) fan who doesn't get or appreciate the beauty of the classic jazz tracks.3. The heads who get jazz and understand the mantra like qualities of EDM.The remixes on this album are mostly fantastic, some are creative and dont hold to a pop format which makes them more uncomfortable than the standard ""song""If you are someone who read Kerouac in high school or university, dug nina and ella and monk and davis and mingus and then discovered the New Jazz (EDM and IDM) then buy this CD. If you are in either of the 2 catagories of uneducated techno fan or old school jazz purist you may have to open you mind to get the beauty of this piece."
2,Worst of the series,"I have all three of the ""Verve Remixed"" CDs. This one is the worst. On this CD, I just cannot see the point of mangling these old recordings. I found no compelling rhythms at all.By contrast, the #2 and #3 CDs in the series are great. I find this puzzling. Usually, sequels suck. In this case, the musicheads at Verve seem to have improved their game with practice. I respect them for that. Now I'll just start up Remixed #3 and bliss out for a while."
4,Wow.,"A definitely well-thought-out, planned project. Remixing some of jazz's greatest voices and tracks has been done before, but this one has been done with a mind and ear for the lounge crowd, so it's very chilled out with spots of funky happenings. if you're into chill-out or the funky house stuff, you have to get it. The Billie Holiday tracks soar, and a lot of it really seems like destiny fulfilled (Nina Simone could come out with these tracks and sell millions all over again).The logical extension of not only similarly rooted styles of music (jazz/chill-out), but of technology; sampling that works in favor of the music. A great record to mess with jazz heads with, though they'll dig it as much as you anyway."
4,Brilliant,"This is what Thievery Corp should have done with their Verve album, but it is good to know they are on it. The weakest track is Strange Fruit. For such a powerful and hauting song, the production should have been better and more fittin for the song. Otherwise definitely a worthy purchase."
3,Spotty but moments of brilliance,"This book shows quite clearly exactly what Chapman's role in Python was: to show up late, do very little work, but contribute one or two outrageously out-there ideas to really stir things up. The Our Show For Ringo Starr script (too bad this was never produced!) reads much more like Douglas Adams than Python, but with occasional bizarre Chapmanisms to keep things interesting (and completely absurd.) The rest of the book echoes things that Chapman has worked on before, and even includes a few lines lifted directly from Python sketches. All that said, however, the book was a bracing, inspiring read -- a refreshing blast of insanity that makes for great (easy) (...) browsing."
1,A TOTAL disappointment!,"This book is a total disappointment. There is a photo of Fredericksburg identified as Gettysburg. There are scores of other errors. There are no significant new finds. I have seen all of the historic photos in other places. The photoreproduction is decidedly poor in most places. Again, a total disappoitment!"
3,The photo angles are poor.,"I have visited the Gettysburg battlefield on numerous occaisions. Everytime that I'm there I bring with me many, many photographs from Brady, Gardner etc. As a result, after hours and hours of exploration, I've been able to recreate 'then and now' photos that are far more accurate than what this book offers. The 'now' photos in this book are not lined up accurately with the 'then' photos. Sure, it is the same area, but with a little extra effort they certainly could have recreated the angles that Brady, Gardner, etc. had shot from. Yet, while the photos are definatley disappointing, this book still provides a wealth of information about the Battlefield. I'm sure that any novice will enjoy this book. If you really want to see what it looks like now, however, you will need to go there for yourself, or explore more specific works."
1,Beware the Maps!,"Other reviews have targeted the dubious nature of thephotographic images and their attribution in this work. Theprospective reader also needs to beware the maps in thiscreation. For example, the 3-D map of the area of Pickett'sCharge on July 3rd shows the ""Copse of Trees"" severalhundred feet south of its actual position; it is shown as being south of Hall's, Harrow's, and even Stannard's brigades, instead of in its actual position. Let the buyerbeware!"
4,Well researched interesting biography,Excellent book for anyone who is interested in a woman of Revolutionary War times who is mentioned in student history books and for whom there has been very little research previously published. I found Youngs discussion of how he arrived at his conclusions very interesting and I am not a history major. For someone who is not interested in that type of detail it would be easy to skim those sections and just find out about her life. It would also give people who have previously read other books or articles about Deborah Samson an opportunity to evaluate the accuracy of that material. I also would not be surprised if some of those who think they are not interested in historical research methods might find after reading the book they are more interested than they thought.
4,Financial Planning for Stunt Pilots,"Die Broke is an extremely seductive book. Stephen Pollan's idea is that you'd be a fool to save your money for a rainy day. He says spend it now, which is contrary to what evey other personal finance expert advises. Take a round-the-world cruise, buy that new Mercedes, or better yet, lease it. This advice goes against the grain, and I found myself fascinated by such an original approach. It's tempting to adopt his methods and live for the present, but my advice is listen to the book, but don't take it too seriously."
4,Good Christian Mystery,"Overall, it was a very good mystery, and I was completely wrong in my suspicions as to who was responsible for Jack Brandon's murder. On the other hand, I didn't feel like the perpetrator was cast correctly. His motive just didn't seem as great as some of the other characters in the story."
3,Interesting Book,"I purchased this book for a class our pastor is teaching. I have to say that it certainly is an ""eye-opener"". We are only on the 4th chapter (one chapter a week) and already many of my beliefs have been challenged. I suggest that you have an open mind when you read this and no matter what decisions you make about whether the Bible is the divine word of God, just remember that man has always been just a man and God is Supreme. As men search to understand the mind of God, they will always fall short because God is unfathomable. Read this prayerfully asking God to reveal only truth to you and not one man's idea of truth."
3,Childrens Book,I did not realize this was a childrens book; so it was of no use to me. It was a mistaken purchase; no reflection on the book itself.
4,Vegetarian restaurants.,Good book to have as well as take on a trip. It was a gift to my daughter and she loved it.
4,Veggie Family On The Move,"This book is very helpful in planning our move across the country. With three hungry children, you can't be driving around looking for a place that serves vegetarian meals."
4,Difficult dog,I got this because my dog doesn't like groomers. Its really easy to handle and does a great job cutting. You'll need to get instructions on how to cut a dog but this is way better than the clippers you get at the store and worth the money. Splurg and get the gards too!
5,The best folk metal since Fintroll,"If Black Metal and Power Metal were to ever have a child (gods forbid save this exception) it would be Ensiferum.Ensiferum uses the melodies and choral arrangements without sacrificing the thrash and black elements.Nothing is more evident than in their new album Victory Songs. With tracks such as the Wanderer and Victory Songs we see the professional and creative side of folk metal. With Ahti and Raised by the Sword we see the more hard-hitting skills that Ensiferum still possess.The album is an awesome listen and I personally can listen to it all the way through without ever getting bored. Whether you are looking for original muscianiship or creative lyrics or both, consider this a perfect buy."
3,Needs Improvement,"Incase anyone was wondering, this is the first full length release from Ensiferum that doesnt feature the creative genius/guitar god known as Jari. The new guy Petri, is from Norther, you know, the Children of Bodom cover band. While he does an average job of handling the vocals and guitar, Ensiferum is not (or were not) an average band. Not only that, but Jaris absence is clearer then day. The music doesnt use folk as well as Jari did, nor are there the freshness and uniqueness that made Ensiferum fun to listen to.Oh well, Wintersun is by far a more godly outfit. Check them out instead."
2,Not nearly as good as 'Raiders' or 'Last Crusade',Watch this movie if you want to pass an afternoon with a bland movie. Kate Capshaw is a great actress but her character was very annoying. Karen Black's strong female lead in 'Raiders' is by far the better of the female leads from the trilogy.
5,Awesome action/adventure.,"I'm a little surprised by some of the bashing this movie receives. Yes, it does have a weaker story than either Raiders or The Last Crusade, but it does have the most action in the series, particularly the thrill-packed finale, one of the best extended action sequences ever put on film. The action scenes here are a bit more polished than in Raiders of the Lost Ark and there's more humor, and even a kid sidekick, which might annoy some. Overall, probably the least of the series, but even at that, it's still the third best pure action film of the 80's (behind you know what two other films)."
4,Lucasfilm and DVD,Does anyone know why George Lucas and Lucasfilm have yet to release the Indiana Jones or the first Star Wars trilogy on to DVD yet?
2,? Was the director asleep?,"Indiana Jones 1 and 3 are the ones you need to pay attention to, not this pieace of garbage. The story line is weak and both of the supporting charcters are annoying. I wish I could say something kinder but I cannot."
3,Is this India?,Fun movie for the not so serious... But the movie is teaching a lot of Asian Indians a new (non-existant) version of their own history. Feels like an India from another planet. Chilled monkey brains and live snakes! Where did they get that piece of history from?
3,Would have been better without the screaming blond.,"Harrison Ford as usual, was great. The screaming companion was irritating and made the whole movie hard to watch."
3,asdfghjk,"This is the sequel. if yu have kids under nine, don't let them watch it. the only good scean is the mine car chase. it's just to grose. OK we have an evil wierdo living under a paless. its a place where you get your heart ripped out and drink blood."
2,"bad plot, too unrealistic","I am not going to give away the plot in this movie. I hate it when people do that to me, so I will not tortue you that way. Anyway, I thought the plot was relatively bad. Bad compared to other movies, awful compared to Raiders and Last Crusade. I liked the music, special effects could have been better. Next: realistic or not?IT WAS UTTERLY UNREALISTIC!How could putting a torch to someone's chest take them out of an evil trance? How could a mine car going very quickly jump from one track onto another and somehow land perfectly? How could a group of archers manage to fire hundreds of arrows at a target and somehow miss every shot by about two inches?Anyway, it was not good enough to be a film even comparable to the other two Indiana Jones movies. With how bad it was and how good the other two are, I wonder why they even bothered to make it."
1,TEMPLE OF DOOM or DANTE'S INFERNO?,"Ever read Dante's Inferno? Well, this is what this movie reminds me of. A dark, red-hued hell with all sorts of devilish characters. Like Leonard Maltin said, it'll give you a headache. The storyline is DIRT compared to RAIDERS. The acting isn't so great, either. And really, who cares about three stupid rocks in the middle east? I don't know if there even is such a thing as three sacred rocks in middle eastern culture, but it would be nice if Indiana went after an artifact that's a little better known to us. Which is why I think the series went with the Holy Grail theme in the last movie, LAST CRUSADE. All in all, this is a very dark, depressing movie, with few parts that are really worth your time, or your money."
3,Good movie bad Villian,It was a great movie. The villian was very week. He wasn't believable.I thought the woman Cpashaw did a good job and so did Harrison Ford. I own this in widescreen. Dan Aykroyd has a cameo appearance.Directed by Steven Speilberg. Written by George Lucas. Cast: Dan Aykroyd.Harrison Ford.Kate Capshaw.Rick Moranis.
1,I used to love life...,I gave this movie a one star review only because there was not a zero star option. I once loved life. After seeing this thing I now hate life. This can't even be called a movie. I now know what it must be like to be consumed by The Nothing. I would actually prefer such a fate rather than watch this movie again.
2,whos the editor of this movie,"the movie starts out pretty cheesy, as when jones throws a spear and it flies like it got shot out of a cannon. a plane flies into the mountain and the mountain is unscaved. a raft as a safety device...c'mon, my butt hurts when i fall off the couch. next is the natives that can speak better english than the little chinese kid short round. i can go on...guns reappearing in indys hand after they fall fly off a cliff, water from a 1000 gallon bucket fills up a lava filled cave. mining carts flying like a plane. alligators that eat clothing. people having their gun jammed and cant shoot it, but still makes a bang sound. people running like bears. rubber swords and pick axes used for fighting. bad guys falling through trap doors designed for when western guys in cowboy hats attack them. but if youre looking for a laugh, rent this...i liked it."
1,Awful,Raiders was great. LC was great. Temple is flat out terrible. Just a ridiculous and poorly done movie.
1,Racist,"I saw this when it came out (I was a young adult.) As someone from a hindu family (I am an atheist), I was revolted by the overt insulting nature of this film towards Indians and Hindus.In the first movie, they treated the whole story behind the arc with respect. Not so with Hinduism.Utter drivel."
4,Temple of Doom most fun Indy movie!,"""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" lights my proverbial fire! Kate Capshaw is the most entertaining of Indy's heroines, and that little funny boy from ""Goonies"" is hysterical as Short Long, the tag-along sidekick of the archeoligist. The opening sequence is fun, as is the plane ride, err, plane jump, and the final run-away cart ride. If only that was the Indiana Jones ride at Disneyland! ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is not as good as ""The Last Crusade"", but its my favorite of all three."
5,Indiana Jones and the Temple of ICK!,"The ""Indiana Jones"" trilogy will endure for a long time--everyone adores cliffhangers and romance, and these three films have plenty of both. Of the three, the middle film, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, is by far the ickiest: the assortment of bugs, monkey brains, millipedes, burning bodies, and unique open-heart surgeries are visually more stunning than tangles of snakes and melting Nazis. But, like the other two, TEMPLE OF DOOM is loaded with action, great pacing, and on-the-money performances."
2,A bit too much...,"Well well well. If it isn't the most contriversal Jones film of the trilogy. I have to say, this film was a bit too much. To this day I'm surprised this movie didn't get an ""R"" rating. Although this film is the reason why there is a PG-13. The biggest flaw with this movie is that it doesn't give us a chance to breathe. It could have been a lot better if only it weren't so violoent and dark. Spielburg said himself that this was his least favorite of the Raiders films. Lucas also agreed that it was a bit too dark for it's own good. They wanted to make a different movie from Raiders of the Lost Ark and I guess this was just a little too different. Not the worst move ever made, but the least of the series."
4,I thought it was exiting,This video was exiting in the temple of doom and when they were eating leaches froma snakes inside at a feast.The set was wonderful.It also had very funny action sequences.The only problem was that some parts got a bit boring.
3,"Too Dark,Too Violent,and Too Pointless!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","By far,The temple of Doom is the weakest in the trilogy of Indiana Jones.It focuses too much on action that there is hardly any room for character development or,more importanly,plot.Overall,watch it if you liked yhe first film.Otherwise,skip it and watch the third film instead. Note:there are two things to note: one,this film is set before Raiders of the Lost Ark,making this a prequel and two:if you have children younger than thirteen,DON'T let them watch this one.This has very graphic violence.The PG rating is a joke!!!!!!!!"
2,A disappointment,"After Raiders... I found this episode dark and sinister with little to redeem it. The actors struck me as very one dimensional and not all that entertaining, even Ford. The special effects were well done as one would expect from a film of this type. I do not find myself wanting to run out and see this again on video, unlike the other Indiana Jones films. I'm not sure what Mr. Lucas was aiming for with this film but he missed me."
5,One of the best movies ever...,"With non-stop ridiculous action sequences, funny acting, and interesting humor, this movie doesn't know when to quit."
5,TEMPLE OF DOOM,"ONE OF THE BEST ACTION FILMS I HAVE SEEN.KATE CAPSHAW IS GREAT!I THINK HARRISON AND KATE HAVE GOOD CHEMISTRY TOGETHER WITH SENSE OF HUMOR TO ADD ALOT OF FUN WITH THIS EXCITING MOVIE. ""A MUST TO SEE"""
4,An action classic!,"This one is my favorite of the trilogy. It is often criticized for being more violent than Raiders & Crusade which I think is unfair. The other two films have people getting run over, blown up, diced by airplane propellors, melted, etc. Granted the chilled monkey brains are a bit much, but the beautiful locations kind of make up for this, and I think the mine-car chase on the tracks is one of the best action sequences of all time. It seems to have inspired a couple of computer animation videos."
4,Still first-rate entertainment!,"...I still love this movie. It's definitely more intense, and not good for kids five years or younger (listen to me, I'm talking like a parent!), but it's just as thrilling, maybe even more so! This time 'round, Indi, an annoying singer lady, and a kid named Shortround are off to save all the children of, and return some sacred stones to, a small Asian village. It's great stuff, and action-packed all the way! And I think it's cool how they made this a prequal to ""Lost Ark"". Somehow, Indi always succeeds to rescue his hat, as you see in one really cool scene."
2,Pimple of Doom,"If you want to believe, don't bother reading this.After much anticipation, I just finished viewing Temple of Doom and found it a dissapointment. Indy's 2-dimensional companions ""Willie"" and ""Shorty"" seemed to toggle between desparate comic diversion and self-serving audience identification. The main villian spouted exotic gibberish to some styrofoam god gave the term ""heart wrenching"" a new definition. The insects were slimy also. I'm sorry- it may be my 12"" TV or maybe I am in a cranky mood, but I found this movie to be a skeleton from the 80s best locked away."
1,"This is Hindu's ""Blood libel"" accusation by Christians","I wonder if Stephen Spielberg would have done ""Indian Jones and the Blood libel"" movieWhere Jews eat Matza balls made from little christian children blood.This is what Spielberg has done.Hindus for the most part...or atleast the religious Hindus are vegetarians for a reason. Even Dalai Lama and all the Buddhists while preaching ahimsa have no problem eating animal carcass. But the religious Hindus do not kill animals and yet this vile movie showcased them eating all kinds of stuff.The origins of such BS came from the Anglican Brits who made up the whole Thuggie story of Kali worshipers killing innocent people. The fact is, those thuggies were Muslims ...and not Hindus.. But it was convenient for the Brits to make up this story against Hindus to justify their tyranny in India."
2,Nazis...why couldn't it have been Nazis?,"Jones is back, grosser than ever, but not better than he was in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. Indy's new adventure is to find three rocks and keep his heart inside his chest cavity. Oh, yeah, don't eat too many of the bugs.TEMPLE OF DOOM misses the mark. It wanders away from what Indiana Jones should be doing, fighting Nazis and using his brain to piece together ancient puzzles and find buries treasure.The value here is that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas will learn what they did wrong for the next Indy adventure."
4,Need smaller sizes,"This is a very nice sweatshirt. I just wish it was offered in a size small, so minus one star for that reason. I understand these are men's sizes, but women like to wear sweatshirts too! And not girly pink ones with rhinestones, we want the real team colors! I washed it in hot water and shrunk it up a little but it's still a little big. But I love it anyway, very soft and warm. Go Sharks!!!"
1,poor quality,"I was looking foward to this product, although the content is very good the quality of the DVD is very bad, the sound is terrible and it freezes up at the end and I have not been able to play the entire DVD. I have tried it on three diffrent machines, so it is the quality of the DVD.I have not called amazon yet about the problem though."
3,Good information,"The production quality was very disapointing, however the information in the DVD was very good. The information contained in the DVD is worth putting up with the poor production quality."
5,Great!,"Son Loved It and can't keep it out of his backpack, LOL. Great reading for my 11 yr old son..."
5,Kingdom Hearts,"Great/entertaining book to read & collect! It is the third book of the 4 volumes of ""Kingdom Hearts"" & later on continues on to ""Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories"" then onto ""Kingdom Hearts 2"" This manga series is great to follow on if you've never played the Kingdom Hearts video games. The games are indeed better to play & understand the concept of the story line, but the mangas follow it very good missing only a few key parts. In all the story of Kingdom Hearts is awesome & is indeed a series to own."
1,Looks great but doesn't keep the dogs at bay.,"The gate looks great and is made of good quality wood, but my dog figured out how to push her way out in minutes."
3,"It's ok, not the sturdiest gate","This gate serves our purpose. It keeps our 2 small aging pugs from going upstairs. It does not keep our toddling grandchildren from knocking it over onto themselves. I know it's not meant to be a child safety gate, but it is actually very unsafe to have around kids. I would not recommend this gate to anyone with medium sized dogs, or dogs who have lots of energy. This gate can be knocked over easily. It does serve our purpose, and it looks attractive. I do think it is overpriced."
5,gate,We own three of these gates and they are perfect for our four small dogs. We can easily step over them to get from one room to another.We have two in our kitchen and we were able to adjust them so they fit perfectly to fit across our large kitchen entrance. We have had no problems with our dogs jumping over them.Very happy with our gates!
3,Richell USA small pet gate,"Bought this on Amazon after seeing it advertised for much more in some catalogs and like the gate, particularly the fact that you do not have to attach it to the walls. We only have cats so it works fine for us, note that some people with dogs find that most dogs can jump over the gate. One major disappointment on receipt was to find that this Richell USA gate is actually made in China, not in the USA. If this had been stated in the description, probably would not have purchased it."
5,terrific gates,"These gates are great because they're adjustable for whatever size opening you need to block; they're only 20"" high, so they're easy to step over AND they look great!I needed to prevent my puppies from attempting to climb stairs, but I did not want to scuff up my walls with the typical baby gate, nor did I want some plastic gate to detract from my decor - these gates fit the bill."
2,"Good looking, but not effective","This gate looks awesome and I love the fact that it is easily moveable and does not mar the walls. However, my little 15 lbs non-athletic pug was able to easily move this to the side and get through it. The pugs are not jumpers so they have not hurdled over it, but they can push it to the side and escape. I would not trust this gate when leaving them home alone. It would be fine if you are in the house and just need to keep the dogs secure for some reason or another. I would not recommend this gate unless you have a itty bitty dog that is not intent on getting out."
5,works great,"Works great for small dogs. A larger dog would probably not be deterred. Looks nice and doesn't mar the floor, walls, etc. I like it because I can move it out of the house when company comes."
4,"good quality, overpriced","this is a nice and sturdy little gate. very easy to assemble, but a little overpriced for what you get."
1,ng,this product is made very well it did cost like $90 however if you dont have the correct doorway it doesnt work...i returned it
1,freestanding pet gate failure,sorry i really wanted this gate to work well so i could get rid of what we're currently using. it's attractive enough but that is it. my 2 small dogs knocked it right over when they jumped up on it. they also can push the sides to get out that way too. we didnt like it at all. packed it up and sent it right back.
5,LOVE this gate!,This pet gate is quality. It not only is attractive but sturdy. My little Westie stays securely behind the gate and doesn't try to push it over as other flimsy gates I've purchased. It looks like a piece of furniture in a room.
2,"pretty, but doesn't work for my dog","I am upstairs at my computer right now. My dogs are gated in the kitchen with this item. As I am typing, my little 12 pound dog once again came racing upstairs to me after moving this gate to the side. It takes him a few minutes, but he can always move it. The bigger dog stays in because the opening is not big enough for him. It's a very pretty gate, and it's made well, but it doesn't keep my dog in. I see another customer's dog was also able to push it aside."
2,not worth the money,"This gate looks nicer than most and is easily portable but it is too short and awkward to fit in most of our door ways. Our dog (only 11 lbs) just jumped over the panel since it didn't fit flush against the stairs. Disappointing, but maybe we'll be able to use it for our child."
5,Great!,Used it for 6 months without ever having to fill it again! Sturdy and comfortable. Even kids jumping on it all the time didn't harm it.
2,"It's ok, you get what you pay for.","This was pretty cheap, so not too surprisingly for the price it's ok but no more than that. It's certainly firm and doesn't let any air out. The air lock on it is quite clever actually and very secure. The two problems it has are that the ridges are noticeable so it's not that flat. I put a thick blanket on it then it was fine, but I only realized this after one night. The other problem is that if the bottom is on a hard surface it squeaks a lot as soon as you move an inch. I then put my rug underneath it and that was fine. These fixes might not be available in a tent though. I'd probably spend a bit more next time, I only needed it for a week though and it did the job."
5,One of my favorite reference tools . . .,"I purchased the 1983 edition of this wonderful little reference when it first came out and have used it extensively over the last 19 years. I've rarely been disappointed in the accuracy of information, or the ease of use. As an 8th grade teacher, I find my students are constantly seeking answers. Often, the larger encyclopedia are too wordy and difficult for my students to comprehend on first reading. If I hand them my Columbia, they can get a pithy summary of their topic, which then enables them to understand the more in-depth entries.In addition to containing an amazing amount of information in a compact format, the illustrations are clear and informative, and the typeface is easy on the eyes.In short, this is a wonderful tool and I have been known to recommend its purchase to students and parents -- whether or not they already have a full set of encyclopedia at home."
4,Nice soccer shoe.,This shoe is comfortable to wear and play soccer for over an hour.Some can find the space at the tip too much but I don't mind it.
5,one of the best paper model books for aircraft!,"I happened across this book in a bookstore and could not resist buying it.To date, I have made the first three airplanes in the book and have loved it. The models are very detailed (for being made of paper) and look very nice. They even got my mom, of all people, interested in paper airplanes.I should mention that this is not a typical 'paper airplane' book. You do not simply take a sheet of paper and fold it in various ways then fly it. You have to cut out numerous pieces, form them to get the proper curves, glue them (carefully, so that the paper doesn't warp when it's drying), and THEN fly them. Even though that may sound challenging, the first few airplanes are enough to learn the skills necessary for the later (and more challenging) airplanes. And...THE PLANES FLY VERY NICELY when built with patience and care!!"
1,"Toothless ""satire""","A ""Jesus"" with a whiny Brooklyn accent arrives nude in New York City (a'la ""The Terminator"") and has trouble getting his message to today's youth. So he puts on a spandex superhero costume and fights Jim Morrison, Dracula, Hitler and a guy in a Richard Nixon rubber mask. Then he changes the commandments to encourage casual sex to gain converts.Let me state that I am far from religious and love a good satire, like ""Election"" or ""American Psycho"". This is too dumb and scatological to be satire. The video and audio (especially) are sub-porno quality. If you ARE deeply religious you may be offended, otherwise you will be very bored. Check out ""The Life of Brian"" for a religious satire with bite."
3,weird,"There is just no other word I can use to describe this film. While I like offbeat movies, this one takes the cake. The concept was ok but the idea of a whiney Christ put me off. Overall I did not like it. If you like offbeat Christ movies then I would suggest Jesus Christ Vampire Slayer, at least the Christ portrayed fights for justice not sulks and whines about how no-one likes him."
1,oops,I have had this plate on my car for 2 months. It has rusted and the red has faded to a pink. Would not recommend.
2,"The actual title is ""Jazzpar 91""","This CD-R may have its' own UPC. I do not know, yet I feelcertain it does not have the fidelity of the original albumentitled ""Jazzpar 91"" recorded in Copenhagen, Denmark andpressed in Japan by M&I; records. I know it isn't easy toalways find the original, much less afford the price. Still,to rename an album released by Storyville in 1991, then makeno mention of this while presenting the above CD-R made toorder simply doesn't set right with this jazz fan. I'm nota fan of Amazon's CD-R's, thus the two stars for ""I don'tlike it."" The original is a five star album."
1,only for decoration,"After long searching I thought Reed & Barton will provide quality in the infants silverware for the price it was asking.However after first use and first drop on the floor, the cup has not one, but FOUR holes in the engraving, and it's now useless.What a disappointment!"
1,poor service,I never reeived this shipment and I am in he process of placing a claim for the charges on my credit card
2,Complete Waste Of Time,"Review by Tyler Wagnon:Ehhh. These reissues bring back a lot of memories, but mostly of stuff I would like to forget. Things like middle school.Blindside were part of the explosion of heavy Christian bands in the mid to late 90's and were one of the few to have a bit of a nu-metal tinge to their sound. Needless to say, the sound on these albums are dated and honestly, Blindside are so far past any relevance in heavy music these days that these are really a waste of time and energy.There are a few decent tracks here and there, but most of the material is just... boring, completely lackluster, and the nu-etal edge is frankly horrible. Perhaps their major label signing had something to do with the reissues, but they are pretty much pointless."
3,"Pretty nice, but a little random.","Blindside's album's got some good songs, specifically Nerve, Superman, and Invert. But most of the CD seems a little random. A lot of their songs lack a sorta coherence. A lot of bands are loud and fast, yet keep a direct driving force. Blindside is a very good band, and has a lot of talent. But some of their songs seemed a bit to random and didn't have a lot of structure than I liked. If you don't mind random, get this CD. Or if you just like hard music and have some money to spend, this is a decent cd."
4,nice cd,"I haven't heard the whole cd, but what I have heard is pretty cool. I have been looking for some hardcore/metal like KoRn, but with Christian lyrics, and Blindside is just what I've been looking for. I cannot wait to get the cd."
5,Blindside Rules the Hard-Core World!!!!!,"Of all the Hardcore bands in the world, Blindside proves the greatest in my mind. Christian (lead vocals) and Simon (Guitar, backing vocals) can sing, not just scream. Their lyrics are meaningful, and their music is excellent. In short, Blindside has every good thing possible in a hard-core band, and then some. Blindside Rocks!"
1,"NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!","Ok; one of the most innovative current heavy acts in the mainstream today used to be finding their feet: this was then. Don't dwell on it. I got this cd expecting to be blown away, but instead I hear a wannabe early Incubus/Mr. Bungle/Slipknot audio-crap. Ugh. This band is good, but I don't reccomend you befile your ears with this pseudo-early band trying to sound like a mixture of the current acts of the time (some may include revolutionary Swedish brother band Refused). Don't bother with this unless you like Disturbed or some crap like that. Good band, but if I were them I'd take this album lock it up and throw away the key."
3,blindside,"I just want to note that this is not hardcore. It is more like MTV metal ala Korn, or Limp Bizkit. It isn't that it sounds bad, it's just not hard core. Anyone who typed in ""hardcore"" go look for Zao, Embodyment, Training for Utopia, Spitfire or Extol...you will not be dissappointed."
4,On the brink of greatness!!!!!!!,This band is gonna be big as soon as they find themselves and get a hand with song writing. I personaly am awed with the vocal range and bass licks. Wow!!!!!I wanted to hear them before I saw them. Now I have. I hope they don't dissapoint live....
5,great cd,"i thought this was a really good cd. invert, born, and one mind are the best songs on the whole cd i think. i think for anyone that likes music like this should definitely get this cd because it's real good :-)"
4,BLINDSIDE ROCKS THIS IS AWSOME,This CD is a masterpeice in the Christcore movment it rocks from start to finish it has a great message in it also they mix gritty hardcore in the vain of NIV and strongarm with mild hip-hop beats there is very little raping but alot of awsome vocals you need to get this CD if you don't have it already
3,"Interesting subject, poor writer","While Nicole Kidman is an interesting subject, and I love to read about her and watch her films, the writer of this book is infantile, and often makes you wonder if he has studied English at all. There are bizarre run-on sentences and wording that simply doesn't make sense. The style is choppy and uninteresting.You might like this book if you are just hoping to learn a little more on Kidman's life, but expect to overlook some major shortcomings in the writer."
2,nothing new,Same stuff you hear in the news. Doesn't tell you about why or how her marriage broke up or anything else really.
4,One for All Remote,"The remote was different in style, but not in function from the one listed on AMAZON.COM. That is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars for this product. It seems to be doing a nice job for what it was intended. If you need a less complicated remote (say for a senior, etc.), this is your answer. Perfect for those who get easily confused by multiple technology on one remote. Easily programmable."
5,One For All URC 1050 Universal Remote Control,"This is a super remote. Simple, does the job. It is not loaded with multi-purpose mumbo-jumbo."
5,pony trouble,"I think this is a classic example of brilliance on a low-budget. The real draw here is actress Irina Peligrad. NOt only is she a world class beauty in the same league as Megan Fox and Annalyne McCord, but she can act and steals this movie. If she ever moves up to A-list films, Fox and and McCord better watch out for the new kid in town.If you read this Irina, I think yer totally hot and awesome and wish you much happiness and success in life."
2,"Lacks depth, comes off boring","I concurr with the other reviewer that this film lacks depth. It certainly had potential to be a juicy psycholigical thriller, but instead this movie is dry as a bone. There were about 20 minutes of interesting scenes stretched out over 90 minutes. The film isn't much to look at either. I only give it two stars because the concept is fascinating, otherwise it is a one-star flick.Maybe the novel this book was based upon is worth reading?"
2,awful,He controls her the whole time. Very sad film. As I watched time flew in an instant. She never had power over herself until the very end.
1,Quick connect problems,"These are older models that apparently have a known design flaw where the quick connects don't seat well and leak. I bought 2 and they both have the problem. I've contacted Delta to get replacement parts because apparently they changed the design to address the problem a while ago. Recommend you don't buy this older, discontinued model."
1,Poor Printing,"Great Book, but the particular publication is terrible. Does not even mention the translation. The print is all but microscopic. Just a cheap computerjob with zero love or respect to the book contents."
1,Digital trickery,"What a disappointment - a translation from German without the translator's name, without any reference to the title in the original version. Notes at the end of the book do not have any references to the page they refer to... This book and the book my husband earlier purchased (same author, same title but different layout) signify a new era of digital trickery - quick publishing from digitally engineered content with no ownership for the quality and authorship. Who is being paid??"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A story about a doctor that has to deal with all sorts of aliens andother problems that makes a fateful choice, that he thinks is the rightthing to do. Others don't agree."
5,Time To Be Better Men,"This is not a long book, but it is extremely powerful. Tony once again uses the Bible (life's ultimate directional book) to show men what their duty is in this world. It shows us how to be better men in every aspect. It is one thing to be a man, but it is essential that you are a Godly man. Tony evaluates through the Bible how a man is supposed to be as husband and Christian. I suggest every MAN reads this book whether you are trying to find your way or not. We all need some improvements on becoming a better Godly man. Tony himself acknowledges sometimes he falls short and has to reassert himself. So let all us men read this book and become better Godly men. It is not just because you want to, but it is your duty as a Christian."
4,Fun for younger children (6-10),"This game is very fun for younger children. I am 14 and found it quite boring after awhile but for younger children these creatures are fascinating to them! My little sister who is 7 (perfect age for these) loves to take care of it and takes it wherever she goes. The beeping noises do get annoying to my mom, the sound can be turned off though but its not as fun. Also they require constant care. You have to check up on it on a regular basis. You can also get other colors and styles of games sytems to match your personality but what the tamagotchi looks like varies. Basicly its a new one every time!The durability is good but if you drop it i heard the screen cracks easily so its not good for small children. And the battery needs replacing but ours has lasted forever! A fun toy for little children in fact my little sister is hooked..."
4,Tamagotchi's are so COOL!,"Hi! I think this toy is REALLY awesome! Version 2 is so cool because the little systems come with pics on them. The lipstick one is especially good for girly-girls, like myself. I own this one. I also owned a dark metallalic pink system, wich was a v1. When the system died, I was really upset cause those batteries are REALLY hard to find. So, here I am wiht my V2. This is SO great and is really good for kids of all ages. Even adults! Lots of my camp counsolours own them. So get one today!"
5,The original fog lights for the BM...,"The only problem but it's my fault, is that it does not includes the cradle where you put this thing on... my bad.. :-(Everything else, it's the original, works great."
5,here is the missing guitar piece,"I too loved that beautiful piece for guitar that we heard a little over an hour into the movie. And it's not on the soundtrack CD! - So, for all those who'd like to have it, here is the full info on that piece:It's called ""The Cathedral"" by Augustin Barrios-Mangore. It's a three movement piece and the final one, ""Allegro Solemne"" was the one used in the movie. I think the version for solo guitar is a special arrangement, but I did find 2 CDs with the full guitar version on Amazon. There is also a version with orchestra. And beware, some CDs only have the first movement of that piece included on the CD!"
5,"Great Movie, Great CD...but where's Dave's True Story?","I LOVED the movie & the soundtrack, but was disappointed that the two tracks by brilliant band: Dave's True Story, ""Crazy Eyes"" and ""Sequined Mermaid Dress,"" didn't make the soundtrack. Both tunes added so much to the story. My solution...buy DTS' cd!"
2,This is NOT the soundtrack,"It's a very nice CD, but it's missing several songs from the film and has several songs not in the film. I felt totally cheated by what was missing. They shouldn't call it a soundtrack if it's not."
3,Rap Song,"The name of the rap song is ""MAD"" by Kurtis Mantronik from the CD ""I Sing The Body Electro""."
3,"Dinner Song - ""Sky's Blue""","After much searching I have concluded that the name of the dinner song ""Sky's Blue"" is a song called ""Lucky Dayz""...The artist's name is Adriana Evans and the song was featured on the 1997 ""Hoodlum"" soundtrack...Hope this helps!"
4,I have a question...,Does anyone know the name of the song that plays when all those guys are watching Jessica swing her hips down the hall? It's not on the CD (I don't think).
3,"About that ""special girlfriend"" song -- gotcha covered.","The name of the song is, ""When the Special Girlfriend"" --The artist is Mischa Spoliansky. The albumn is ""Ute Lemper - Berlin Cabaret Songs."" Whole album is good.--Stormy in Texas"
5,A must have,Purchased this as a gift for a friend who listened to my CD. It is by far the best feel good music on one CD. Old & New songs that just make you happy!
3,The Rap Song,Does anyone know the rap song and artist that plays when the two finally start to get it on. It is just after the restaurant scene where the two guys are babbling about two women together.
4,Thank you for the missing guitar piece info,"I enjoyed both the movie and the soundtrack but I too was disappointed the guitar piece was missing from the soundtrack.Thank you Markus for the information. I found Sharon Isbin to have a wonderful version of ""The Cathedral: Allegro Solemne"" by Augustin Barrios-Mangore, on two of her CDs."
1,self-serving garbage from Verve Records...,"What? You mean soundtrack albums are supposed to have something to do with a movie?? We're not gonna put Dave's True Story on the album just because their music was in the movie - we got more important things to worry about, like marketing our own catalog...Come on - we're trying to sell records here! So what if half the songs weren't in the movie?"
5,Wonderful cocktail party music!!!,"I bought this CD for the two Blossom Dearie tracks but came away loving Lyle Lovett's ""Gee Baby, Ain't I Good to You?"" Also, check out Dinah Washington's sexy ""Teach Me Tonight""!This compilation is a great introduction to some of the greatest female artists in the history of American music. (Okay, I'm only 26 but learning!) You will not go wrong buying this CD!"
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS EVER WRITTEN,"ARCHBISHOP SHEEN DOES A REMARKABLE JOB OF SHOWING THE READER HOW THE ONLY TRUE WAY TO ACHIVE ABSOLUTE FREEDOM AND ARRIVE AT BEING A TOTAL PERSON IS THROUGH THE HOLY SPIRIT AND THE GRACE OF GOD ALMIGHTY. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL WHO ARE HURTING BOTH SPIRITUALLY AND MENTALLY AND WANT TO FIND TRUE ""PEACE OF SOUL""."
5,A great teacher.,Fulton Sheen is one of the best authors in our lifetime. This is just one more great work produced by this very talented and inspired individual for anyone on a spiritual journey towards heaven. Find out how to have true peace of soul with the use of this excellent book. You will not regret it.
2,hard to read,I've read other Bishop Fulton's books but this one was hard to read and understand unless you had a PHD in Psychology
1,HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT YET,ORDERED THIS BACK AT THE BEGINNING OF FEBRUARY AND STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT. WHY IS IT TAKING AMAZON SO LONG TO GET IT IN. WOULD LIKE TO GET IT BEFORE I WENT ON VACATION.
2,Two for Billy,"The only reason why I gave this one two stars is because I love to see my man, Billy Zane, in his surpreme bastard roles. It's a real turn on. Other than that, I've seen better movies on the weather channel."
3,Only MST3K could make this one worth watching.,"There are a lot of ridiculous elements to this movie, but as a whole it's not campy enough to be entertaining by itself. There's Billy Zane's bizarre tirades: ""Commandment One Minus! Verily, the Lord sayeth..."" or something like that. And his almost self-parodying arrogance. And his 400-pound wife. And his comically redundant narration of what's happening on the screen. And the sign that misspells the Spanish word ""medicina."" And the horny female cop. Amusing at times, but pretty slow going--the longest 1:40 I've spent in a while. Probably more enjoyable if you don't try to follow the confusing, almost random ""plot."""
4,Intense and gritty film.,Dysfunctional characters well played by star actors. Billy Zane is excellent in this film. I can relate to the sometimes irrational logic of the lead actors' observations and actions. Dark humor and snappy lines. Would like to seek out the book it is based on and read it.
3,Tedium and Gratuity,This is rather tedious and not my taste at all. Period setting looks stylish but the actors struggle with a clumsy script and obtrusive direction+AMI-
5,Fit and Worked perfectly on my Palm TX.,"Right out of the box and into the car plug, it worked excellently, keeping my Palm TX balanced and recharged while using it. It works as advertised and recharges well, definitely an excellent product, bought it around 6 months ago and it is still keeping my Palm TX recharged well on the road today. It is Plug and Play, no fiddling with it necessary."
2,"Simple, Elegant and Wrong","Roberts' little fable pits a wholly benign free-trade against absolute protectionism and guess which one looks better. Based on the theories of David Ricardo, the fable assumes that every worker in the world is always treated fairly and every boss is kind and responsible. In The Choice there are no sweat shops and no corrupt CEOs. Fables like The Choice (or the ""free-market economy"" for that matter) are easy to believe because we want the world to be that simple. That's why the book is dangerous. The Choice has almost nothing to do with the real world, but it sounds good. The argument is so seamless that it appears almost unassailable. If you buy Roberts' version of Ricardo, however, you must accept Wal-Mart as the epitome of business virtue.Roberts may be a great guy, and he certainly writes well. Unfortunately, his book begins with a series of fallacious premises and works its way toward a conclusion that is simple, elegant, and horribly wrong."
5,Good book to follow Econ 101 macro/micro,"Required reading for my MBA program. A short but good story. Interesting. Read in one day.Recommend this book, along with ""naked economics: undressing the dismal science"" by Charles Wheelan and ""The Undercover Economist"" by Tim Harford. These books provide interesting reading to help supplement learning about economics. All three books are more interesting than economics textbooks filled with charts, graphs, curves, shifts, etc."
5,Insight without economic jargon,"This book clearly states the case for free trade without falling back on dense economic theory and technical jargon. Especially with the protests and controversy surrounding globalization and trade today, it is more important than ever for people to understand that free trade makes us all better off. In fact, there is no better way to improve the lot of two countries (and their overall welfare) that to reduce trade barriers between them and allow each to concentrate more energy and resources on their comparative strengths. The Choice delivers this message clearly and articulately in the context of a fun and simple story that even the most protectionist leaning person would have difficulty refuting."
2,Not what I had hoped,"I've had this cookbook for quite some time - looks like an older edition than is sold here. I had never really used it, but recently found some tasty recipes that I wanted to make. I have to say I was rather disappointed by the end result of all three recipes I made last week. They lacked real flavor and, on top of it all, were really labor intensive. Not meals you'd want to make after a workday. I feel that I find so many more interesting vegetarian recipes elsewhere."
3,Good but,"It's a nice book, but I felt it was too long. Overall though I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it."
2,Too mant grammer errors to read,"This book really dissapointed me. The binding is terrible. It is so hard to read because every other word practically is misspelled or words are stuck together so that they run into each other & you have to figure it out to understand the sentence. It got me so mad and frustraited because it was so constant, that I didnt even want to read anymore of it. It has several things that are interesting but so much that I was exspecting to look up that wasnt there. Mainly its about alot of people. I was looking more for myths I guess. Anyways, makes me too frustraited to even want to read more :("
5,Great reference book,This book has the thorough factual history of many famous mysteries. It is objective without being skeptical. Interestingand also detached.
3,"Thorough, Sometimes Repetitive, Sometimes Interesting","The Mammoth Encyclopedia of the Unsolved is certainly what it claims to be. It is indeed mammoth as it ranges from the paranormal to more historical mysteries. The authors', Colin Wilson and Damon Wilson, pet theories become abundantly clear as certain themes and concepts are repeated throughout the book, such as their ideas concerning poltergeists which are shoe-horned into far too many of the entries outside of the one for poltergeists. They also have an annoying lack of scepticsim concerning anything paranormal yet pull away the cobwebs from more historical occurences with great ease. Still this book will be a treat for anyone looking for a one volume compedium of weird things. You may roll your eyes at some of their conclusions but you still keep reading."
4,A great primer...,"...on weird and unexplained things. I like to think that I'm up on all my oddities and weird occurrences, but this had a few that I'd never heard of (Fulcanelli, Rennes-le-Chateau), and some others that had new information on them (Kaspar Hauser).However, this is by no means a definitive work. As another reviewer pointed out, some of the authors' information is a bit dated. Also, the authors tend to get a lot of their exercise jumping to conclusions based on very little evidence.It's an enjoyable book, definitely; I appreciated it immensely, and was glad I purchased it. However, it's not the be-all and end-all of unexplained mysteries."
4,It's Fascinating,"At first this feels like an ordinary ""book of wonders"" ... just another collection of wierd stuff and Fortean phenomena ... but after a while you start noticing common threads running through the articles as the Wilsons drift away from their research and expound an enticing occult / paranormal philosophy. Most of the stories in this book were ones I had read or heard about before, but this one really surprised me by exposing me to exciting new ideas. I wouldn't say I'm a believer, but it definitely changed my thinking. As an experience, this book is well worth your time."
2,the drawings are not as good as other books,"the drawings are not as good as other booksand the one I got has the different cover design, I prefer this one shown here than the one I received!!"
2,If you're going to rewrite the POH...,"for godsakes at least rewrite it well! The low-quality of the writing gets in the way of extracting any useful info from this book, and is downright confusing in many places. But what rips me more than anything else is that 95% of the material in this book is from your POH. The rest of it is inapplicable for US students or isn't particularly insightful. Spend some time with your POH and you'll get the official, updated info, straight from Robinson. The POH is well-written and 100% accurate."
4,Good add-on to the POH.,Good book that add some interesting points of view to what is already in the POH. Graphics and description are a good support in understanding the R22.Worht the investment.
5,How many stars can I put?,"This is one of the best books I ever read. Allow me to indroduce the characters.The Hatfords:Jake and Josh are 11-year-old twins. Josh is kinda nice, the quieter of the two, who loves to draw. Jake seems pretty heartless at first (at least if you're a girl), but when I read further into the book, he got better. Wally is 9. He's the one who narrates every other chapter. He's okay, I guess. 7-year-old Peter is the cutest of all the boys.The Malloys:Eddie is 11 and loves baseball. Beth is 10 and loves to read. 8-year-old Caroline is a budding actress, and trades narration with Wally.I think this a good book, even though I wish the girls would have won at the end."
5,Naylor best book ever!!,"Just when the Hatfords were expecting three boys to move into the house the river,where their best friends used to live , the Malloy girls arrive instead . Wally and his brothers decided to make them so misrable that they will want to move back to Ohio , but they havent counted on what the girls had on mind!From dead fish to dead bodies, floating cakes to floating heads, the pranks and tricks continue - First with the boys, then the girls - until someone is taken prisoner!"
5,"Good story, good book!","This book, along with its sequel The Girls Get Even, is hilarious and kept me laughing the whole time. It is well written and grabs the attention of the reader. The war between two families of girls and boys and the pranks they perform will put you in stitches! But if you get this book, you HAVE to get the sequel. They belong together, and continue the adventures and follies. A great book!"
1,Thought it was complete knee pad not a part,"I thought i was buying a complete set of knee pads but only got a replacement pad, No information on returning it lost my money."
1,knee guards,"returned items, was an accessory to something else, i did not have, not what i expected or wanted; information in ad, did not explain this"
1,I have purchased better,"I didn't find this book to be what I was looking for. I wanted something easy to read for a quick brush-up on basic grammar and punctuation skills. Instead I found quite a few technical terms that I don't know off the top of my head. It made the contents confusing and ultimately I put the book down after a few minutes. Not enjoyable or easy to read ( they do exist!). It's not to say the writers aren't knowledgeable, they are, but too much so. Try something else if you're looking to brush up on your skills."
1,So many other grammar books...Why this one? (Good question!),"This book lacks any content. When it does say something, it is brief. Don't buy this book: invest in Elements of Style or the NYT Style Book. This one is skimpy and cursory."
1,"Reference, not tutorial","This book may be a good, concise reference for a teacher. If you are trying to learn about grammar on your own, save your money: try """"Grammar Smart : A Guide to Perfect Usage (The Princeton Review)"""" instead."
3,I don't know what to say...,"First, I will admit that I have not purchased the book. I read the preview, and the book would appear to be the reference I was hoping to find. I am, however, put off by the number of sentences the author begins with ""and"" or ""but."" Is that part of the new English? I am hesitant to purchase this book in which I would hope to find the definitive answers I am seeking when I am immediately hit with this error in the author's writing."
5,Don't Hesitate,"I've had a chance to play my new Takamine G340 LH for a few days now, and I am ready to give a review. First, I am just getting back into playing guitar, so I wanted a basic dreadnought capable of a folksy campfire sound. I gambled on the Takamine, and I won! Honestly, it is beautifully designed and the sound is warm and very nice. I was very hesitant buying a guitar online without playing it or hearing it; also, there's relatively little written about this guitar. I rolled the dice at $199.00, and ladies and fellows, you should do the same. This is probably the best priced left-handed starter guitar you will find anywhere. The finish is stunning and the abalone is radiant. There is nothing bad to say about it. You may question yourself, saying, ""Maybe I should spend a little more and get a Yamaha or a Seagull,"" but don't hesitate. Trust in the Takamine. I promise I don't work for Takamine, just a happy picker..."
4,Good Book,"The book starts with an overview that spans over the basic essence and inception of advertising and slowly the author migrates into the concept of advertising and how it got matured over the time. These are illustrated by examples of advertisments released in few decades. The book targets on fundamnetal advertising principles which need to be understood like Knowledge of the consumers, products or markets. There is a breif stint with creative startegies that can be used to gather response to advertising. The author also touches media planning in significant detail. To some extent an attempt has been made to quantify the advertisng results.Overall an interesting reading as it provides sufficient insight to advertising as a subject and there are examples that help understanding betteer."
3,"The music is great, but....",Avoid the 1994 CD version of this album. There are vinyl ticks and surface noise on all the tracks. Not sure if later CD versions sound better or not.
3,"Great story, sloppy editing","This book was a real page-turner, a la Crichton. But it seems no one went back and proof-read it! Many errors, typos, and totally verkochte use of commas!"
5,Approved by a yoga teacher.,"I'm a yoga teacher, and I love these bolsters. I ordered both the round and rectangular bolsters for my home practice. They are both exactly what I wanted - the perfect size, dimensions, and firmness. Excellent price, too. I would definitely recommend them."
1,Don't bother...,"This is not one of those "" so bad, it's good "" movies. It's just plain bad.Even ardent Brooke Burke fans will find it disappointing.I actually threw this movie in the recycling bin rather than subject another viewer to this total waste of time."
3,OK,this is an interesting DVD. I don't think it is for every one. it can be a bit depressing. it does show a deserved out come for a bad situation.
4,An Era of Discontent,"The themes of coming of age, identity and ennui have never been so well intertwined for the feminine subject! While this tale is a snapshot of the 1960's era, the post-modern themes still read and feel as if the experiences were contemporary."
2,"Derivative and ambitious, ultimately unconvincing","I have not had the benefit of reading the author's husband's works, but will give reviewers who have the benefit of a doubt, that this book reflects the strengths and weaknesses of his work. This author starts out strong with Leo Gursky, whose voice remains the strongest in the work. However, this character is derivative, depending a lot on Saul Bellow and Isaac B. Singer, and ultimately descends into bathos. I had difficulty in following the (to my mind) excessively complex, blowsy plot, which I suspect reflects the current level of the writer's style, without her husband's influence. She attempts to keep fifteen balls in the air and drops a few. I felt that, having missed a couple of turns at the end, that p'rhaps I should go back a few hundred pages and Review. Maybe Diagram. I decided against it, feeling that I should reserve this sort of attention to War And Peace."
4,An excellent and intelligently crafted read,"The character development was intimate and genuine, providing an interesting collective pondering on the meaning of life and relationships. Both of the main characters are realistic in the saddest and happiest ways. I would recommend this book to anyone despite its tacky sounding title, because it is anything but."
2,Difficult to follow,"I found myself going back many times to reread parts, and try to figure out just what was going on. This book is part mystery, part love story. Interesting, but I needed to pay attention to much, and didn't get enough answers at the end. Great book club read, though, and the chat going on at the end of this section really helps a lot. Don't read too much of it prior to reading the book, but use it as a way to get questions resolved once you've finished."
4,Very good but not great,"Both the book's ethereal charm and its weakness spring from rapid shifts of character, continent, and time and the loose braiding of events. We don't stay in one place long. While I did not find the string of coincidences that drive the story believable and in mild confusion often went back to check on relationships and events, the main characters are so strong, ""real,"" and likeable, I found myself holding my breath as I read and willingly suspended my disbelief for the pleasure of the ride. An engaging, fast, and not overly ""deep"" read about the many facets of love."
2,by and when,When you read this book. By tomarrow. If you want to be in the crowd. Literate. Present.That is how this book is written. With little depth. By tricks and prepositions. And. The. One. Word. Sentence.Is theTone.Style.Great?Yes.But I would hardly call this aGood.Book.JustTricks. Of someone who is not. Too Clever. For me to see. Past.
1,not worth the time,"I gave it one star because I don't thing you can give a review NO stars.It was all over the place and very strange. I am a voracious reader, but this book wasn't woth the time to read it! or the money to buy it - even discounted on my Kindle!"
2,Confusing!,"Some parts of this book were great, but it was hard to get into and extremely confusing. I still don't know what happened to Bird, Alma Singer's mother, did Leo die on the bench? Did his son ever read the manuscript? Was Bruno real?? So many unanswered questions. This book was very disappointing."
3,A story within a story,"This is a rather strange book with several stories and a number of ""real"" and imaginary characters intertwined. Some of the sections would make good stand-alone short stories. Finally, in the last few pages, all of it comes together and makes sense.The book is is well written and keeps the reader interested. However, the actual (fictional) ""History of Love "" sections that are ""quoted"" are really quite silly and made me wonder whether the author couldn't have written something better for her characters to make such a fuss about."
3,Sweet but a little self-important,"The History of Love is a well-written quick read, and is a sweet story with very likeable characters, but it seemed like Krauss was aiming for something more revelatory than she actually achieved. I'm basing that largely on the title, which seems to be promising a lot. Maybe I'm being unfair.I didn't find some of the more experimental stuff (like the pages of alternating points of view in the last chapter) distracting. Personally, I think most of the experimental devices improved flow and economy. I can understand why you might come to a different conclusion though, particularly if you read her husband's book Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close and expected Krauss to employ the devices in the same ponderous way, which she didn't.I really like Krauss though. I'll have to pick up more of her work."
2,Labor of Love,"Nicole Krauss' The History of Love is ingenious and precocious -- ingenious for its plotting, precocious for its fluent, page-turning style. But it hardly shows much to us beyond its own spectacular surface. And this is odd and disappointing, because it appears to be structured to allow a glimpse into something deep and mysterious. That is, this isn't a novel of character development; if anything, the characters are fully formed by the time Krauss gets to them, and they are used to spin the plotty tale. There is poignancy in the stories, and Krauss should be credited for not leading us to a too easy epiphany at the end. But ultimately, sentiment gives way to sentimenality. Hoping to illuminate the sinuous paths of love and affection, Krauss reverts to a winking knowingness. I concur with James Woods who, writing in The London Review of Books, says this novel infantilizes its readers. One feels manipulated by the entire mechanism -- a fully achieved writerly machine."
3,Thoughts on History of Love,"Intriguing enough to keep me going, but sometimes infuriating. Some sections were truly moving (particular those involving Leo Gursky), others exasperating, particularly involving the youngsters. They were depicted as full of good intentions yet for them, apparently lying, stealing and destructively meddling in their mother's work was as easy as breathing and this didn't seem plausible in the context of the novel. I found it disappointing, yet at the same time with much to offer."
4,"Loved this, very bittersweet","Can't review it in depth without spoiling it. Just loved the Leo Gursky character....the story really resonates. Not a lot of surprises, but very well written. Read it, you'll be glad you did."
5,I love The History of Love,"Beautiful book. It made me laugh, it made me cry. I will read it multiple times over the course of my life."
1,Waste of time,"I'm an avid reader, but have never written a review. I felt compelled to do so for this book for the sake of other readers because it's one of the worst I've ever read. I'm sorry I even have to give it a 1-star rating. It's inconclusive, confusing, and wholly unsatisfying. I persevered, hoping it would come to something in the end, but it never did."
1,i forced myself to finish it because i bought the book....,"I agree with the previous reviewers who emphasize the difficult to follow, convoluted style. Since i bought the book i forced myself to finish it......i should have cut my losses and not have wasted my time on such a boring mess."
1,Not So Good,"I was hooked by Leo Gursky in the first chapter. Unfortunately, it went all downhill from there. But for the strength of Leo, I would not have continued reading. This book was a big disappointment."
2,Not Likeable,"None of the glowing reviews for this novel is accurate.I found it confusing and utterly frustrating. Just when you think it can't get worse it becomes ok. And just when it becomes ok it gets worse and you think you have nothing left to look forward to. Well let me tell you, the ending is just as baffling as the rest of the book.There are a very few pages that will endear you to them, but worry not, it lasts not long. If you're VERY bored this is an ok book. It will pass your time at times. But as for recommending it, it could have been soooooooooo much better.It's true most of it is written in so many styles it will leave you confused. But I'm no critic, make your own decision. I just know I will not look for more by this author."
5,Absorbing and touching,"What an interesting book! It had it all, an absorbing story, characters you cared about, humor, and emotion. I was hooked from the beginning and crying at the end!"
3,"""The History of Love""","Somewhat confusing to figure out who is who and how theyrelate to one another. Interesting characters. Thoughtful lookat aging alone. At times funny, but mostly sad and thoughtprovoking."
5,Magnificent and Beautiful,"This book as absolutly great. Its a novel that can appeal to many different people, not only women who enjoy a good romance on a rainy day. This book incorporates a number of different characters who all are all weaved together to show the beauty of love, lost and new, and the interconnectedness of the human race. I sincerely recommend this to those who would like a to read a fantastic book about love and family and hard times that try the soul."
4,"Intriguing, moving and profound","I found this impossible to put down; you fall in love with the characters, their stories and the writing itself. My only frustration was going from one character to another and sometimes losing the thread of the previous character's story. Not a book you can put down and get back to three days later; at least not for me."
1,I Hated Book!,"After reading a recommendation for this book, I decided to check it out. I found it confusing and annoyingly quirky. The characters were all isolated loners. Very depressing."
3,Frustrating and hard to believe,"I got bogged down in the middle of this novel. I liked Leo, but I wanted him to end his self-imposed loneliness and get on with his life. Alma Singer was a bit quirky, and the ending was a bit too neat. In the end, I wasn't sure what was really motivating Leo and Alma.This is not a bad book, but I don't particularly recommend it."
1,A disappointment,"Based on the reviews, I was looking forward to reading this book. I was hoping it was a classic on the scale of Henry Roth's ""Call It Sleep."" But it was not. The story was bland, and the characters were flat. It was not well written. What a disappointment!"
3,good but flawed,"I found this novel to be very cleverly engineered and there is an abundance of talent here, but a lot of the Jewish themes were not as deeply felt or truthful as some other lesser known and less ""trendy"" novels. Kraus is surely a writer of promising gifts but many of the events and people felt insincere and painted there for effect and ""laughs"" in this book. The drawing upon Saul Bellow and Bruno Shulz may have been righteous but I think it was more imitation, one-dimensional and self-conscious."
2,Good book club discussion,"This book was hard to follow. Half the people in my book club thought one of the girls was a boy (the way the author wrote character). I would not recommend this book to anyone but a book club read. The reason for the book club reading this book is that the we all missed or found things that others didn't catch. So, it was a very lively book club but we basically all agreed (12 women) that we would not have finished the book if it wasn't our book club book."
2,flawed but sometimes terrific,"This book reads like a short story that got expanded just to make it a book. The story of the old guy, Leo, is terrific in detail and longing and perspective. The rest reads like filler - clever filler, but still, the only voice I wanted to hear from was Leo's, and much of the rest is just irritating and so convoluted that it's hard to follow."
3,Found the book confusing.,"I had to ask someone else who read the book to explain all the different Almas. It was interesting but the characters--Alma, Bruno, Bird--were difficult to place in the different stories."
5,Super,very interesting book... I would definetly recommend this bookvery passionate and human good for all audiencesvery nice reading!
4,Amazing writer,"I loved the book and it's various pathways, but it was difficult and confusing at times to keep track of it all.The author has great talent, I laughed and I cried, and will probably reread it at some time."
3,"Beautiful prose, quirky structure, dreadfully sentimental ending...","The History of Love has much to recommend it--two marvelous main characters in Alma and Leo and minor characters who actually seem to be real rather than just support plot development. Bird and Bruno in particular are finely drawn and Krauss' injection of humor and pathos are beautifully paced.I was ready to love this book and recommend it to everyone I knew until the last fifty pages. An absurd confluence of ""happy"" coincidence and a major dose of sentimentality spoiled it for me. A shame really--could've been great."
5,Great Book Club Choice,"Other reviewers have said much in praise of Nicole Krauss's beautiful & sensitive History of Love, which was my book club's choice for June 2006. I can't top the superlatives, much as I'd like to, & won't bore readers by trying.The subtleties of Krauss's writing are what make the book such a wonder, & her mention of The Street of Crocodiles is not to be overlooked. As you read, before the fog of confusion that has not lifted for some reviewers engulfs you, google Bruno Schulz & read his story. It is almost certainly the impetus for Leo Gursky & The History of Love.Much to look forward to from young writers Nicole Krauss & talented husband Jonathan Safran Foer."
3,"Beautiful in spots, but confusing","Ultimately, this is a tale of the triumph of life over the alternative, no matter what the circumstances or how precarious the grip on living. The central character, Leo Gursky, is someone to treasure for his tenacity and prickly personality. But the book is organized using alternate narrators and it jumps around from person to person, place to place and past to present in a most confusing and off-putting way. Granted, it's an original way to tell a story, but I found that I lost the thread of the action when it moved away from Leo's tale. Eventually, the two stories intertwine but it takes too long and link between the parts is so tenuous that it's hard to keep the characters straight. Not recommended. My score would be 2.5 if fractions were available."
4,Poetic History,"Books rarely bring me to tears because of how beautifully written they are, but here is one for you to try. First: the language. Such voices in my head, I can't tell you. Second: the structure is gorgeous. I've often grown impatient with the common device of alternating between and among characters, but this time it works just perfectly.Finally, the truth. This writer knows people, evokes them with an unblinking eye for detail and tone. Rueful, strange, nearly blanketed with sadness at times, yet. So good.I didn't really expect to like this book much, but you know, the reviews were promising.And delivered."
2,An Annoying Disappointment,"This book was a disappointment. It was overwritten, self consciously mannered and just plain annoying. The picture of old people was revolting-- too much bathroom minutia. I didn't much like any of the characters -- who weren't believable in any case. I read the other reviews and can't understand the praise. Oh, well-- each to his own."
2,History of Confusion,"Who? What? When? Why? These questions plagued me throughout the book. Other reviews have called this book ""brilliant"" -- I think that is another way of saying ""I don't understand this book either."" Even the ending was tied up in a slip knot."
1,Readers love it or hate it.........no middle ground,"The History of Love was a selection for a book group. It clearly split this group down the middle. Readers either loved it or found it boring.This is the narration of a man's life through war, love, loss and enlightenment. He discovers that a story he wrote for the woman he loved has been published by a younger man many years later. As he searches to remain a visible presence in the world, the elderly locksmith seeks out the truths that seemingly lock themselves out of his reach.There is also a very young woman looking to obtain information on who she has been named for.The tale entertwines itself in a way that makes it nearly burdensome.The people that loved it, loved it a lot and defended it vigorously."
5,A Wonderful Book,"If you like good writing, you don't want to miss this book. I wasn't hooked by the first few pages, but thank G_d, I picked it up again before returning it to the library. I loved all of the characters, especially Alma. Krauss's story manages to be both mundane and yet magical. It was probably the best book I read this year."
5,The History of Love,"The History of Love is a beautifully written, imaginative, story. I enjoyed every moment of reading this book. I recommend it to students, professors, and the general public. Nicole Krauss is a genius of a writer. Enjoy"
3,"readable, intricate, moving (though with some flaws)","I didn't like Ms. Krauss's other book that much (Man Walks Into The Room), and I found myself half not enjoying History of Love either - despite its readability, nice writing, intricate plot, and deeply thought through characters.Part of it was a trivial hatred for a phrase the main character keeps using (""And yet."") which seemed to mean, ""Hey look, I just said/thought something meaningful and deep and beautiful."" Part of it was the overly precocious children characters who were mostly children, but sometimes unbelievably overly adult. Part of it was the book within a book conceit, which seemed just to say pretty things in pretty ways.But in the end, I was tremendously moved (I cried through the end and for ten minutes afterwards), and am still thinking about how it all came together, in that way life often does - unhappily, unresolved, and with just enough of the human essential: acknowledgement. Thank you, Ms. Krauss. I'll look forward to more."
4,Lovely!,"This was July's book club selection and I greatly enjoyed it! In continuation with our current WWII theme, this book is more about the layers and coincidences of life and relationships than about the war itself. Strange and beautiful, the unique style and perspective completely caught my attention. There was a definite storyteller-quality to the book - particularly from the sections from Leo's point of view. I think it would make a wonderful audiobook. Really, it was a beautiful and sad story, with all the pieces fitting almost perfectly together at the end. A good choice for book clubs, we had a lot of material to work with in our discussion."
4,Literary Success,"A clever interweaving of various stories about a manuscript and Jews in various conditions, the reader is made too aware of how clever the writer thinks she is. The characters are not fully real. Yet the acclaim she received is underestandable for the writing and devices are skillful, the complications challenging, and the book interesting."
2,The History of Love,I found this book very confusing. You have to reasly pay attention or you are totally lost. Sine if the characters do not make sense until the wnf
4,The history of my love for this book,"I loved this book. The language is beautiful; so many sentences I just had to stop after reading them and marvel at how perfectly profound it is. The contrast of the different characters is phenomenal, though a little confusing at some points since the plot unfolds only as you read on. Leo Gursky is perhaps one of my favorite characters in fiction to date."
5,different than anticipated,"I had to read this book for my bookclub and it was really really different than I thought when I read the jacket. It moves and it always seems to change and shift before it gets too dull. Its a strange read though, not sure i'd pick it up on my own."
1,Not a good piece of literature.,"I enjoy a wide range of literature. But, I am sorry, I did not think this book was worth my time. I got very frustrated with Krauss' writing (""And yet."", ""But.""), I did not find a real mystery or climax, and did not perceive any sense of closure for any of the characters.On the other hand, if you want to read a good book about a book, please accept my recommendation of ""The Shadow of the Wind"", a truly entertaining and beautifully written novel. This book received a lot of praise in Spain and the rest of Europe. Enjoy."
1,Couldn't finish it,"I tried and tried and tried, but I could not finish this book so I ended up giving it away. I wasn't interested in the characters and the story was just boring to me. I hate to start a book and never finish it, but this book bored me so much that I didn't care. Nothing about this book impressed me."
1,Overrated!,I did not like this book from the very beginning. I thought it was difficult to read and tough to follow. The characters were not likable. I made myself finish the book because I had hopes that it would get better. It did not. I was sorry I purchased this book.
3,A smart textbook with a few inaccuracies,"THE HISTORY OF LOVE provides a fairly thorough treatment of the much-discussed subject, though I suspect its origins fall on a date somewhat before that ascribed by Krauss and her fellow researchers. From my own study of the relevant primary documents, I would place love's origins near those of the cotton gin. Consider this, from the early letters of Beatrix Marypole: ""Today we have had to drag dear Eli in from the fields again, the poor sot. 'Tis true that this be a man who truly, truly loves cotton."""
1,I might have enjoyed it,"I like a good convoluted story. I like to figure out what's going on. I liked Leo and contemplating his loneliness. I don't like profanity. I could have really enjoyed this story without the profanity and a couple of uncomfortable scenes. I'm old-fashioned. If you are too, I'll save you the discomfort of reading this book."
3,The History of Love,I thought it started out strong and fell apart at the end. There were so many characters spanning years that this story was sometimes hard to follow. A good editor could have encouraged the author to tighten the story and bring all the threads together for a stronger ending.
4,"Good, Not Great",Alma and Leo are both fascinating characters and great narrators. The author seems to have complicated her plot a bit too much and it does require the reader to go back and forth in the book searching for clarity. The ending is ambiguous at best.
2,Didn't finish it.,"My sister recommended this book so I was eager to read it only to find that I was only interested in the present involving Leo. When the book switched, I lost interest and did a fast forward to Leo in the present again. I usually persevere with books and try to read the whole book but with this one, I felt like it was too much of a slog to finish it. i gave up and moved on to another book."
5,Too bad I can't give it 10 stars...,"You must read this book.I am a voracious reader. I am a bibliophile. I read and read and read, and I own many, many books. But, even before I finished this book, I knew it was going to be my new favorite work of fiction. Ever.This is a magical piece of work. It has some of the most beautiful writing I have ever read in my life. If you are a romantic, a lover of language, a poet, or simply a fellow reader...buy this book. Now."
2,"good story, but falls flat","I bought this book because of all the great reviews it received, but I am very disappointed with the story. The novel is very interesting the entire way through and I really expected it to build up to something big, but I felt the ending fell flat. The story is a puzzle, and the reader continues turning the pages to find out how all the pieces finally fit together, but then is left feeling unsatisfied. It seemed to me that the author focused on the complicated narrative structure rather than creating a meaningful story that touches the reader."
3,it had potential...,"I was recommended this book by a friend and had such high hopes for it. This book really had the potential to be a great novel. It had love. It had numerous stories that start out spaced far apart, but come together in the end. It has mystery and hope and all of that good-book-nonsense. I REALLY wanted to love it.Instead- I spent most of my time confused. I had to assume things in order to let myself mentally move on in the book. The ending did tie a few loose ends together (for which I am very grateful), but it still wasn't enough for me.I would only recommend this book if you can remember every small detail, every small hint, so that it can help you to understand it all in the end. This book can't be read in small chunks of time- I would say only three or four at most. It would be good for a rainy Sunday afternoon. Just pay attention to the details- they really do count in this book."
4,Interesting,"This is one of those books that when you finish reading it you're still thinking about it. It appears to leave a lot of questions, but most of the answers were in the book very subtly. The surface is simple to read though somewhat disjointed. However, with more depth the connections are very beautiful.Not a breezy summer read, but not particularly difficult either. I would recommend this to people who are looking for something that isn't too difficult, but still intellectually stimulating."
2,Incoherent Hodgepodge,"The book got off to a real good start. The old man named Leo was interesting -- fascinating in fact -- and I was enjoying reading about him when -- whammo! -- the book turned topsy-turvey and I couldn't figure out what was happening or who was who. As one of the other reviewers noted, I kept wondering when we were going to get back to Leo. Somehow or other we got sidetracked into reading about some other people who weren't at all interesting and about a book within a book whose relevance to anything else was mystifying. I guess this is literature, huh? Anyhow, the author can string words together real well and her tales about Leon were, as I said, fascinating. But around page 100 I got tired of trying to figure out this maze of a book and tossed it."
4,Loved and intrigued by this most complicated and puzzling book,The more our book club discussed this book the more intrigued we became. What a project this must have been for the author. We all came away in awe.
2,Once is more than enough,"I read this book for a book club. I have to say it was tough to get through. Like others have written, it was a bit confusing in spots, and very hard to keep track of the characters. I wasn't endeared to the main character very much, and the other main character, the girl, was a bit more intriguing at least. I just don't have a lot to say about it, I finished the book, said thank goodness after that and then I didn't think too much about it."
4,Very Interesting,This was a wonderful book but very complicated. I spent the first half of the book flipping back and forth trying to keep all the characters straight in my mind. Several times I was reading thinking it was from the perspective of one character only to find out that it was another character. It took me longer to read this book due to all the back tracking and re-reading I had to do. The second half of the book brings the story together and overall the plot is wonderful. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone without a disclaimer regarding the complicated story line. It is well worth the read but at times difficult to follow and confusing. I encourage anyone to push through to the end as it pulls everything together.
5,"Engrossing, Enriching, One Worth Reading Again and Again","Unable to walk away from the characters (who are so deeply made known...and so quickly), I finished this book within 24 hours of purchasing it. The gradually unveiling of ""the truth,"" the richness of the characters, the universality of the pain and joy...I was in suspense and awe throughout the entire novel. I will read this again immediately. Highly recommended."
3,A very unique book,"The author of this book is a great writer. And the book is totally different from all other books. When I started reading it I was LOVING it. The characters were awesome. She really does a nice job of making her characters quirky and interesting. But I started to get really confused and was like ""Who is this person?"" ""Where is this book going?"" I love a book that makes you put all the clues together and provoke some thought but this was just way too much. I tend to have a racy mind anyway so I guess I just couldn't follow it enough."
5,very moving and inspiring,"I found this book moving and inspiring on several levels.First as an author myself, I found the message about how a book can exert such an influence and be such a power for good and for life inspiring. Second, I admired the author's ability to get inside the skins of a 14-year-old girl and an 80-plus man with equal success.Third, it was a moving testament to the power of love.Fourth, she writes like an angel.Her success is totally deserved."
5,"Excellent choice, amazing book.","I could say many things about this book, but I won't... I believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and in this review I intend only to say what I personally thought of it. This is by far one of the most beautiful books i have ever read. The writing style changes with the different characters, the plot is never spoiled, the rhythm of the words is unique and strong, yet subtle and harmonious, everchanging, bending without breaking, stretching without failing.The one story is not one, but two, three... three perspectives, like three voices in a choir, singing now together, now alone, but never stranding for the harmony of the music.I loved it. And I am grateful to have been given it as a present."
2,Confusion Reigns,"Confusion was the overwhelming reaction to our book club's reading of A History of Love. As a result, our discussion was a series of explanations about who was who rather than the themes, characterization, etc. of the novel. One of the members felt it necessary to read the novel twice and took notes in order to make sense of the plot and the characters.On the positive side, several of the characters were engaging - namely, Leo, Alma and Bird. Leo's circumstances made us sympathetic to him as he fought to remain visible in the world. Alma and Bird's struggles to grow and mature as they were overwhelmed by their mother's grief were causes of sadness to us.We decided that the author was attempting to remind readers of the Holocaust so that we would ""never forget."" However, requiring readers to jump from Nazi Poland to New York City to Chile while keeping track of each character's relationship to Leo Gursky obscures the theme and lessens the impact of the story."
4,Poetic Prose,"This is one of the best novels I've read in a long time. The prose often approaches poetry as you follow the various threads of different storylines throughout the novel. Toward the end, the threads become a little harder to follow as they begin tangling a bit, but perhaps this is what the author intended. Life and love are like that, tangled and sad and wonderful.It's a wonderful book and I've already ordered Ms. Krauss's first novel, ""Man Walks Into A Room"" to read as well."
2,What a mess,"My book club chose this as our January selection. After discussing it with five other people, I have a better sense of what the author was trying to do, but the first reading was rather confusing.The author is not only trying to juggle the perspectives of the two main characters, she also tosses in the perspectives of some of the minor characters. This forces her to jump through space and time creating a rather incongruous mess. I am generally good at puzzles, but even I could not see how she was going to weave it all together at the end."
2,Beautiful language but disjointed,"Story lines were disjointed and hard to follow. They did not come together until the end. The language, however, was beautiful and poetic."
1,Waste of time,"My reading time is precious. I read a wide range of books by a wide variety of authors. I found this book terrible. I tried to ""get into"" the (creative?) mix of styles, disparate story lines, and quirky characters, but I just couldn't. When I got to the end, I was absolutely baffled. Not only was the book confusing, but when I actually step back and look at the plot, it is just NOT GOOD. There are so many good books out there! Honestly, I read this book based on the editorial reviews all over the front & back covers. I am not going to make that mistake again. I am so mad that I wasted my time reading this book."
5,Wonderful Wonderful and Magical,What a beautiful tale. The characters were so rich and poignant. One of my favorite books of the year. I love the style of the book and was sad when the story ended. Heartbreaking.
3,History of Love,"As I began the book, I didn't care about the characters, and some of the techniques that the author used bugged me. As I finished, I still didn't care much for the characters, or the book that much although it was a well written story. A few days passed and the realizations came through about the book: it's brilliant, I just didn't like it."
2,Maybe history isn't my subject...,"I am sincerely surprised by the amount of positive acclaim for this book. I love a book which has different chapters written from different character's view points but this was just too confusing until the very end when it finally begun to make sense but the ending definitely left something to be desired. And after it was all said and done, I felt like I had wasted my time. Just not an interesting story - pass on this one!"
4,"Bad title, Great book!","Don't let the title fool you. This is not a harlequin romance. Yet this is a romance. It's a human romance. The History of Love is the title of a piece of literary non-fiction nested into the story, of which the author offers parts of chapters throughout her novel. It is a beautiful book, one I wish I could read in its entirety, it so lovingly depicts the birth of feelings, the origin of communication, and the parallel story of a youth in love. Read this beautiful book that you wish would never end."
5,Haunting & Beautiful,"I have never submitted a review before but had to comment on how much I loved this book. The characters are so clearly yet succinctly drawn, they feel so real and are heartbreaking. It was the kind of cyclical book I enjoy where you read the last page and all is revealed yet you are questioning everything as you interpreted it & have to return through the pages to make sure it was as you imagined it to be...A beautiful book...read it!"
4,Captivating Story,"I really liked this book. At one point I got two of the characters mixed-up, which really confused me, but even with the mix-up I still really enjoyed the book, the story and the writing. The change of perspectives through the book kept it entertaining as well."
2,I know most reviews are glowing...,"For me this novel was all over the place. I am intelligent and can grasp different plot lines, narrative points, etc. I just felt the author did not bring these together in a cohesive fashion. I do appreciate some stylings of humor, however her approach on that level tires after a while. I won't spoil the ending, but I will say there wasn't much of one at all.I had to read this for a book club. Half of our members raved about the book - others felt as I did. It really was a mixed bag.The author is young, and I can see she has potential. I will read her next novel. I haven't ""written her off"" just yet..."
5,One of my all-time favorites!,"Be prepared for confusion; this book weaves in and around you until the end when all of the storylines come together. Be prepared too to live in the aging skin of Leo, the main character. Krauss is a beautiful writer; my book was filled with highlighted passages that I felt compelled to remember!"
3,hard to follow character development,"It took me two weeks to read as I was busy. Every time I picked up the book, I couldn't recall the characters. There are too many characters and the book bounces back from several past times to current times. Good story but you need to read it in few sittings."
3,Leo is the star of the book,"The first few chapters on Leo sucked me in. Suddenly the book switched gears and we were in the mind of a pre-teen/teenage girl. I started to get bored. Then it went to Leo and I was engrossed again. Then the girl and I was bored again. So it went on and off through the book. There were other POVs but Leo's was the most compelling and best written. Bird also, but he played a minor role. The plot of this story is actually good, but the execution was a bit messy with the time frame and again multiple POVs. Some people complained about the ending, but to me, the ending really saved the book. It was clever and beautiful and had a surprising twist I did not see coming."
2,This is a review for the audio version,"I stopped reading during the third disc (about 1/4 of the way through the book) for two reasons: 1) mainly because I had ZERO interest in what happened to the annoyingly precocious Alma and 2) the voice of the person who was reading about Alma was as irritating as fingers on a blackboard. The first section -- from Leo's quirky perspective -- was charming and endearing. That narration was performed by the always superb George Guidall. Once he became silent, the book lost its oomph. Two stars for that brief visit."
3,THE HISTORY OF LOVE,"I FOUND THE STORY VERY CONFUSING. THE STORY KEPT JUMPING FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER, ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER....TOO MUCH CONCENTRATION TRYING TO KEEP THE STORY STRAIGHT....."
3,Love lasts forever,I enjoyed the way this book was read. Three different people reading a characters views of the things happening. Giving you a perception of thoughts as each event unfolds. I find it made the book more interestingbecause it was an audio book. I recommend this audio book.
1,Thisbook is a stinker...,"This novel is a mess... an incoherent mess.90%percent of the book I am scratching my head wondering what in the heck is going on and then begging the author to BRING IT TOGETHER! I love a book with some suspense as far as the inner connectivity of characters but this was WAY over the top. Pure Torture with no resolution, no satisfactionOn a positive note I DID like the author's writing and flow of language, I DID like the characters, I DID like the stories within the chapters BUT she just never tied it together. Blame the editor."
1,boring,i looked forward to reading this book because it was one of amazons favorites. it was so disappointing and boring. the characters were dull and you never really cared about them.
3,Still streaks? Try another product.,"I was skeptical of the reviews that said that this was going to leave streaks on your stainless steel appliances. Not anymore. I think I bought this product because it was a little cheaper than what I normally buy. I buy the magic wipes. The magic wipes don't leave streaks (you have to read that you wipe with the grain of the steel), but these cerama wipes definitely do leave major streaks. I know another reviewer said wipe it with a dry paper towel in the end and I will try this. However I don't want to continually do this, because I would be wasting time trying to make it perfect. My hands also feel gross afterwards. Yeah I know I was going to wash them anyway, but it is the purpose of the review to let people know what you think. Anyway, I won't be buying these again, because I have found the product that I like better. I will be finishing them off, but won't be suggesting this to anyone else."
2,Doesn't seem to do much.,"I wouldn't buy these again. Firstly, I could not withdraw a sheet from the center of the roll without tearing the edge. I finally had to pull out the entire center which consisted of perhaps a third of all available sheets, then I couldn't reinsert those that I didn't need to use. I wrapped those in saran plastic wrap for later use. I also wrapped the entire container in saran wrap to keep the towelettes moist for later use. I really couldn't see any before and after difference."
3,Streaky til wiped again,"This is the first stainless steel cleaner I've bought, but I sure thought it'd work better than it did. It left streaks until I went back with a dry rag and wiped it hard...but after that it stayed looking nice for a few days (I have a 1 year old and a messy 4 year old). So I like it after all is said and done, but it's a lotta work."
4,stainless steel wipes by ceramabryte,I love these pop out wipes for a quick wipe and polish. great for a busy hectic day when we don't want or need extra minutes of work
2,Might want to consider another brand,"I've used other brands that out perform this one. Spend a few dollars more, it might be worth it. These leave streaks."
1,what a massive waste of words,I agree with reader wsmith@thgi.com from Chicago. The whole thing is just too illogical.I personally don't cotton to religions so THAT was a complete turnoff right off the top.I read his Children of the Night(5 stars)and so looked forward to his view of the universe. I was sadly disappointed.
2,It never really got going,Ugghhh!!! I read the whole thing. I really thought it had the possibility of getting really really good soon but it never did. As the book ended I was upset that I had wasted so much time waiting for it to 'get good'. I was very surprised to see the great reviews here!
2,This won the Hugo?,"While chock-full of interesting ideas, the story drudges along through a morass of overly expressed adverbs and adjectives without any real benefit to the plotting. Not to mention, the story as a whole is really a compilation of six 30-page expositional short stories loosely tied together by an additional 100 pages of story set in the ""present"". The author also overly uses sex and descriptive references to human fluids in what feels like a contrived attempt to lend interest to the story. It was only through pure will that I made it through this book (and the fact that behind all the garbage, the background ideas are quite interesting). For those looking for an interesting jaunt through sci-fi check out some works by Orson Scott Card, David Brin, William Gibson, or Robert Heinlen. This book just isn't worth the time, IMHO."
2,A big disappointment,"The most important rule in Science Fiction for an author is to work the technology and sociology seemlessly into the story as quickly as possible so that the reader can understand everything as the book unfolds. Simmons does not do this. Instead, he writes a very confusing group of independent stories with confusing explanations of the structure of his world. And, as a final blow to the reader, he does not even finish the story. It is one thing to write a novel with the idea of a sequel (as Orson Scott Card does with his Ender series). It is quite another thing to drop the reader into the ""valley"" with his characters and not even offering some conclusion. Adding to this unfortunate ending is the fact that his characters are annoying and do not create a reason for the reader to care about them. I am reading the sequel only to find out what happens."
3,I love this book!,"Dan Simmons has written an exclent book. Although the book is confusing, he still describes the characters well. He uses suspense to let the reader enjoy the book. Simmons describes the characters so that the reader can image them as real people."
1,horror of a fevered mind,Perhaps I simply have never encountered this type of writing before - so dark and filled with unending images of disgust and horror. The writer is a compelling writer but I'm half way through the book and don't think I can take a moment more in such a hideous imagination. I hope some innocent and healing hand touches this fevered mind and lifts it into some kind of peace.
5,An amazing work of science fiction.,"A typical science fiction writer - at least a typical writer worth reading - uses and develops in detail a handful of key points, lest their story becomes gizmo gaga and mutates into the clichéd state of 'Star Trek'. Hyperion is convincing proof that Dan Simmons is NOT a typical writer... he passed that stage long ago.Hyperion is an incredible book. After the first three pages, in which Dan Simmons is a bit overwhelming, the story does something most scifi fails miserably at: running the gamut and fusing nearly every idea ever made great in science fiction into something unforgettable. The seven stories - the overriding plot and the six travelers' personal stories that explain the mysteries of the Hegemony - weave together into a work of art the quality of which is rarely approached within the genre. If the story didn't get better in the following books in the quadrilogy, I'd say that Dan Simmons had an unimaginably lucky break."
5,Best sci-fi book ever!,Dan Simmons take us into such a complex and fascinating world that you can't let his book go.The pilgrims' stories are masterpieces in themselves and the web-world scenario presented to us is described in such stunningly details that you would think he (Dan Simmons) had been there himself. Hyperion is a must to read.
3,For Hardcore Sci-Fi Readers,"It was out of pure curiosity that I read this book and it wasn't all bad. The charcters were wonderful and the plot intriguing, but at some points(like at one spot in ""The Soldier's Story"")I found it to be very violent. Normally I don't mind this, but one part of ""The Soldier's Story"" was excruciatingly hard to read. On the brighter side I found this to be a very well-written piece of work and anyone who is into Sci-Fi a lot should enjoy it."
5,This book rules!,"This is the first book in the greatest sci-fi series in the history of the world. If I had time, I would rather read this again and again than shaking hands with the president. And, I would rate this book as better than sinking the titanic, visiting the Oval Office, or supersizing the Big Mac. Thank you, Mister Simmons, for giving me a reason to live."
4,"Rich in detail, well written","This was a wonderful read, it was well thought out and so much went into the details. I found myself not wanting to put the book down as each individual's character was unfolded one at a time. The only criticism I have (and not really a negative) was that at first it was a little hard to follow the technical details, but I somehow think this made it a better sci-fi book. Ending the book with a cliffhanger was upsetting, but it only assured that I would be purchasing the Fall of Hyperion."
4,Simmons is in the upper echelon of Science Fiction writers,"Dan Simmons has produced an exceptional work in Hyperion. The book is a gem of ideas that was carried through by a writer who understands wordsmithing, storytelling and characterizations and how they all work together.Unfortunately for the reader, Mr. Simmons wasn't very successful getting the same power in his next few book about Hyperion and the extremely interesting characters."
5,"My favorite series of all time... aside from DUNE, of course","This series is so spectacular! I've read it 3 times & plan on reading it again soon. Definitely buy at least the first two books together, since they are the same storyline split right down the middle, it will frustrate you if you don't have the second book right at hand. The last two books were by far my favorites!"
5,A very easy read,"For me a good book is an easy read. That is not to say I like simple books, topic aside I like well written books and Dan Simmons has without a doubt written a very good book. The fact that this book has an average of 4.5 stars does not surprise me at all. You just have to read it to believe it :)"
5,Top-quality science fiction!,"Hyperion will absolutely blow you away.The thousands of worlds of the human Hegemony are slowly collapsing into decay, corruption, and war. It is against this dark setting that seven pilgrims--a diverse collection of people ranging from a sadistic ex-soldier to a two-hundred-year-old poet--set out on a journey to the mythical planet of Hyperion, seeking out the monstrous Shrike. Each carries a desperate hope and a terrible secret. One holds the fate of humanity in his hands.The book centers on the tales of the seven pilgrims, their hopes, their dreams, their fears, and the motives that drive them to risk almost certain death at the hands of the Shrike. The story is richly imagined and textured with deeply human intensity. It's dark, frightening, enlightening, humorous, and heart-breaking.And impossible to put down."
5,I love this book!,"How do I start? A great book, that forms the begnning of a series. In this book, a great picture is being reaveled to our eyes: A wonderful and fritning reality. I won't tell the story, but the stories of the six pilgrims are exciting and interesting in so many ways. Altough this book is actually just a prolog, the reality that it builds is something magnificent. I just hope that the following books won't let me down."
2,KINDLE Version Flawed,This review is only as to the Kindle version. Found the story amazing and engaging but the many mispellings in the Kindle version were a definite distraction. Hoping the next book in the series escapes this fate.
4,Very good indeed,"I agree to the positive feedback given until then. This book is very good and the darkness of it makes it very intricate and dense.I just regret one thing:There are many typing mistakes in the Kindle edition. It looks like it was scanned in low resolution and the l appear sometimes as i, the e as c, the G as C (the famous See of Crass!)...Otherwise, it is this kind of book which makes me enjoy every cent send for my Kindle!!!"
5,truely great work from a true sci-fi master,"i have been a fan of simmons for several years now and it is all due to the Hyperion Cantos. These four books and Orphans of the Helix are works that I truely believe, like the works of Lovecraft, Aurthur, and Asimov, to name a few, will stand the test of time. The characters are so well drawn out, and weaved so intricately into the story(even over the 300+ years it takes us through{700+if you factor in Orphans})that I've read the series through 6 times and undoubtedly when i do it again, I will find more that I have missed. It is a definate read. I have told everyone I know of the magic that is this story, and the master that is Simmons."
3,THREE and a half stars FOR BOTH BOOKS (its one story),"This is another SF story about far future events of cosmic scale, but it isn't child's story like special effect SF movies (think Star Wars). It consists of two books and for me they are one story that shouldn't be judged otherwise.First part, 'Hyperion' , is about seven travelers who tell their own tale and reason for their journey and second one, 'Fall of Hyperion' , is conclusion, with almost all whys and wheres explained (or at least writer tried to do it).Book is very nice but not great great. Last parts are difficult to follow and the end is somewhat pretentious.If you wanna top SF, try Phillip K. Dick's 'Man in High Castle' or 'Ubik', Clarke's 'Oddysey' , and there is much more stuff. This book is somewhat for specialized audience!"
3,Well written dissipointment,"Long story, but interesting development of individual stories. This book was handed to me by someone that could not finish the book due to boredom, it is slow. The ending, well there isn't one, so if you are one of those expecting any culmination to any issue developed in the book, read something else.It's a good story and it's well written if you are not a grammar Nazi but it leaves you flat and it is slow. It's highly over rated compared to classics like Dune, enders game, snow crash etc... but to each his own."
3,"Great science fiction, uninteresting characters","I have to say that the immense detail that Simmons goes into in this book is truly amazing. He manages to meld a whole futuristic universe together and make it seem like your actually there. However, by the end of this book, I was left feeling uninterested in anything that had passed. The short stories are intertwined rather well, but overall lead in no general direction whatsoever. While this lets you get a good idea of what each character is like, each story is very very anticlamactic. I had no want to read the next book in the series after finishing this, Ill take the book in for the experience It was, a decent read..."
5,This is it,"The last great sci-fi novel? Could be, I have never read anything approaching it since. I also recomend you pick up a book of greek and roman mythology. The series gets its character names from there."
4,Slow Reading Fun Book,"This is part of a two book series. The book is complex in story line, and plot. Sometimes I got lost in the characterization, but found it as the book move forward. This book was actually a great read."
3,Hyperion e-book,"I bought Hyperion as an e-book for my Kindle. Maybe I really am old-school and love to turn the pages because I felt the Kindle version was extremely short. The story of Hyperion was an interesting read, but I felt lacked the passion of Ilium & Olympos. Somehow it just fell short of continuing the excitement of the previous stories. The only thing I can think about is that Dan Simmons knew he needed to write the book; however-maybe he just wasn't feeling it with the heart and soul intent that he seemed to have poured into the Ilium. The Ilium is still one of my most favorite books I have ever read. I really enjoy Dan Simmons books and will continue to read them."
4,Simmons Should Have Never Abandoned SF,"I had the opportunity to meet Dan Simmons at a Writer's Workshop in Kansas in 1993. To my embarrasment, I was the only person in the group of 20 potential writrs who hadn't read Hyperion. When i got back home I bought the book and am ashamed to say I still didn't read it for another NINE YEARS!! Well, I have now and it is nothing short of brilliant! Combining the scope and majesty of Dune with the interpersonal relatings of Foundation, Simmons' most famous novel is a masterpiece of human drama, evolution and expansion into the next realm of reality. The only reason this book got 4 instead of 5 stars is because I now have to read Fall of Hyperion to get the rest of the story!"
4,Some nice ideas,"I agree with some of the other criticism of this novel - that the style appears to be very much in imitation of early Asimov and Clarke. That's not necessarily a bad thing, if that's the kind of Sci-Fi you like, and I do.What struck me most about this was the ideas presented. Some were fleshed out a little more than others, and I expect that some of those which were a little thin will be more fully explored in the sequel ""Fall of Hyperion"" (not read it yet, but it's on the list).There are enough characters that everyone should find at least one to relate to, perhaps not at first, but certainly after their personal tale is told.The ending was a little abrupt for my tastes. I had assumed that this was a standalone, but luckily I am already in possession of the sequel. There are sufficient unresolved issues to ensure that I'm looking forward to that."
5,The best sci fi series EVER begins with Hyperion,"Yes, I said it. The best. Then Frank Herbert 's Dune.The characters were fascinating, the scenes memorable. To this day I see them In Color in my mind's eye. Thepriest and the flaming, lighting trees, Kali, the Shrike, Sad King Billy - to name just a few :)Dan Simmons ' Hyperion Cantos begins with Hyperion. Even if your not particularly rabid about the genre, there'senough here to grab onto, and I for one am in Awe of this author.I hear that Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion are being squeezed into 1 movie treatment - on again off again. I wouldlove to see Ridley Scott, or Peter Jackson direct - but that will never happen.The Hyperion Cantos is recommended without reservation."
4,"Fantastic story, great writing, terrible Kindle edition","Dan Simmons is a fine writer and this story is amazing, as most of the other reviews detail. But the Kindle eBook is riddled with spelling errors, so much so that you can't tell what some words are supposed to be. Spectra should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such a low quality edition of a great writer's book."
2,No ending,"Book full of stories that deserve endings, yet when the time comes, it doesn't happen. Angry for wasting my time with it."
2,Trying too hard,"I picked up this book based on the suggestion of a friend and a lot of critics reviews calling this one of the best sci-fi novels.Well, I would not call it exactly a disappointment, but it was definitively not up to my expectations. The author seems to be trying too hard to define a future world, and is constantly forcibly drawing parallels between his future situations/devices/event with real life. The use of alternative language for ""every day"" things is sometimes inspired (e.g. ""entropic tides"", ""farcasters""), but most of the times they feel gimmicky and almost tacky (e.g. ""death wand""). The HYPERION universe and mythology is not as rich and nuanced as, for example, DUNE.The sub-stories, which are really the core of this book are entertaining in a pulp fiction way, but, IMO not significant (socially, or even within the context of HYPERION itself; see DECAMERON), or even memorable enough to make this book a must read."
5,Drew me into a new world,I was told by a colleague that this was an excellent story. I read the reviews and many stated that this was an excellent story. I still wasn't prepared for the reality of how well written this story actually was. I became completly emersed in this new world. The writing was sophisticated and created a depth of character that has been missing in many other books that I have read. Can't wait to read more.
4,"Enjoyable, not quite epic!","I've been on a sci-fi and fantasy reading binge over the last few months and Hyperion came highly recommended from a few friends. I enjoyed the book. The narrative style is interesting and I liked the way the reader is introduced to the elements of the Hyperion universe through the stories of the pilgrims. I disagree with reviewers who have problems with the descriptions of sex in the book. The author is tasteful. He does a good job of conveying the complexities of his characters. However, the book ended rather abruptly for my taste. The book could've benefited a lot more from building details of the universe in which it is set. I've ordered the Fall of Hyperion and can't wait to read how all of this ends."
3,fascinating story....,"Dan Simmons has written a fascinating story, and one that leaves me hanging in such a way that I want to keep reading the series. That being said, I found the settings more complicated than enriching, and many of the themes more simply sadistic than dramatically compelling. The Shrike is like a hunka-hunka burning saw that wants to embrace you...(ok). Dan Simmons is a little too stuck on pain and gore, but regardless it's still a damn good read, and I still want to know what happens next. He can spin quite a convincing world for you to wander in your mind's eye. I just like my sci-fi a little more Wagner and a little less Puccini."
2,100 Words or Less,"The detailed, unique universal construct makes this novel shine. Yet, all that luscious background cannot hide the weakness of the story. Or I suppose I should say ""stories.""This is Sci-fi Canterbury Tales. The entire novel reveals the history of the 7 characters chosen for this specific mission. The individual stories are good enough, but after the fourth, I found myself skimming. It's too unrelated. Too eclectic.And then comes the end ... rushed, abbreviated, truncated, and nonsensical. All this sound and fury leading to nothing. Huge disappointment. And in some ways, a waste of my time."
2,Yikes! The Shrike!,"After slogging through six or seven-hundred pages of a story with characters I didn't feel much sympathy for, I expected some kind of payoff and didn't get any. Just the promise of a six or seven-hundred page sequel with no promise of Shrike-like closure. Maybe I shouldn't judge the story from the standpoint of what I wanted out of it. But you know what? Life, as any Shrike will tell you, is way too short, my brothers and sisters. Leave Hyperion where it orbits - in the dusty recess at remote edge of the universe. You'll save a couple of light years of your time."
3,Be warned: non-english native language readers will have hard times,"This book is might be perfectly written for a NATIVE English speaking reader.For others: you have to open dictionary very frequently. I have read 50+ english books (Asimov, Orson Scott Card, Robin Hobb, George R.R. Martin, etc.) and this was the first when i had to look up words in a dictionary. Actually i have to use it 2-3 times per page (really frequently).Due to very slow/hard reading experience i gave up even before finishing the first story.So if your primary language is other than English, then consider choosing an another book or at least try a sample."
2,Boring!,"Hyperion is about a group of seven people on a pilgrimage to the creature called the Shrike on the world of Hyperion. During the trip each of these people tells his or her story to the group to better understand each other and to possibly help one of them survive the meeting with the Shrike. Sounds like a good premise for a story huh? Don't be fooled, the stories in Hyperion are long, boring, and drawn out and each story gets progressively worse as the book moves on. It's hard to relate or get attached to any of the characters and the environments leave much to be desired. Do yourself a favor and pass on Hyperion."
1,Unreadable crap...,"The story is a sequence of stories told by pilgrims on their way to a shrine, much like the Canterbury Tales. Except in this one, the characters are neither interesting or likeable. The time-traveling notions in play at the shrine and in some of the stories are silly and poorly thought out. Any attempt to wade through the morass of disconnected junk that makes up this novel is a complete waste of time."
1,Sullied talent,"Mr. Simmons writes well and his story is powerful. His characters are well developed and the book is definitely though provoking. Sadly, the profanity and explicit sexual content destroy any virtue this book had to offer. I cannot recommend this book to anyone."
1,Garbage!,"This book is a total disappointment. Really, just stay away from it and ignore all the glowing reviews. I have a hard time understanding how people could get fired up by such a drivel."
1,The true symbol for anit-climax,"This book had many clever ideas, and was a good vision of the future. However, this book had literally 0 plot. The entire story is a background of seven different characters, telling why they are on the planet Hyperion, and why they want to meet the mysterious creature the Shrike. The book climaxes to the night before the meeting of the shrike....and then simply ends. It was a pathetic end to a pointless book. If youre thinking about buying this book, think again"
1,Got about 6 pages into it. That was more than enough.,"Thankfully, I wasted only a very brief part of my life with this horribly pretentious book. I should have known right on the first page -- any sci-fi novel that starts off with a reference to an obscure piece of classical music is a deal breaker right there.From the get-go, there was too much of Simmons's overwrought style and self-indulgent jargon. I got about as far as this bit of prose-fapping:""If the fleet did construct a farcaster in time and the Hegemony committed the total resources of FORCE to defending a single, distant, colonial world of Hyperion, the Worldweb ran the terrible risk of suffering an Ouster attack on the elsewhere...Before I said ""WHAT?! The hell with this!"" And resisted the urge to farcast the book into the trash."
1,"If you liked it, you need a drool cup.","One of the worst books ever written. The sequel is another. Fluff for the easily impressed. If you are completely taken in by verbose drivel and pseudo-intellectualism, this book and it's sequels are for you. I would have rated it a ""1"", but the words were spelled correctly"
2,Hyperion hyperion hyperion,"This book is well written and fairly readable, but overall reading experience will be much less than the sum of the parts. The book is composed of pieces that knit nicely together, but the actual story does not work. Mostly this is because the ending is as well thought as ""then I woke up""I don't know why this book has won an award for anything.. Perhaps the author wants the reader to buy the rest of the story in an other book, but as for me.. I will leave Dan Simmons alone from now on."
3,"Just Ok, Not A Must Read","Skipping the fluff? This book is just Ok, not a must read for anyone who likes Sci-fi.It took a little while to get going because it's broken down into smaller stories so you can get a background on all of the major players, and that's OK. You actually can feel which ones are written earlier and which ones were written later, because they're a little more developed."
1,Interesting in parts...but a real struggle to finish,"Really a collection of short stories though they are all related to the central story. Ultimately I think it had a rather boring non-ending. Maybe the end was supposed to be this big twist/surprise but it fell kind of flat to me.Don't see how this has gotten such a great reviews, I won't be reading any of the sequels."
2,Disappointed,"This book is a collection of several stories of varying quality.Overall, I found the writing style to be too wordy. I would rather be entertained by ideas than an unusual use of words.While I did enjoy a couple of the stories, two others left me completely indifferent - if not annoyed at having to read them.The overall story was intriguing enough that it kept me reading to the end. A secondary benefit I was hoping for, was reading about one particularly annoying character's death. Unfortunately, the ending has let me down on both accounts. Not only did the annoying character survive, but there was also nothing even remotely resembling a conclusion.Two stars - for the two stories I enjoyed."
2,Boring,"I read almost the entire book before I realized I was BORED.. It had some nice ideas, but I just couldn't continue anymore. I'm suprised it has so many positive reviews on here."
4,Combined with 'Fall of Hyperion' simply excellent,"The Technocore is a complicated construct of AIs, the Shrike a powerful monster of metal, the Hegemony about to face war. Six pilgrims embark on a pilgrimage to save the known universe...The story just gets better as you read on. The characters are unique and intriguing. I hold this in my top five."
5,A great book - Canterbury tales revisited,"Not only is the story itself wonderful and addictive, but for those sci-fi fans out there, Simmons creates a wonderfully new and fresh perspective and vision (as the series progresses you will see exactly how large and complex this vision is). As well, I particularly enjoyed this book, with its series of tales told by fellow travellers - reminiscent on the Canterbury Tales of Chaucer, yet new and different. This book - this series is one of the great works of fiction to come along in a good while."
3,The Canterbury Tales with a Scifi twist.,"I originally read this book when it first came out and was on the bargin bin heap. Simmons weaves a masterful story, but and it is a big but. He has taking great classical English Literature and re-written it. This is simple a space age re-write of Chaucers the Canterbury Tales. If you enjoy Scifi read this book it will expose you to one of the Great Literary works in the English Language. The Canterbury Tales!"
4,Long and disconnected but interesting,"I'm writing this after reading the 2nd book also, so, looking back I can say that I enjoyed the characters here as well as the means of telling their stories. Taken by itself this was a good book."
4,Pretty intresting,"I like its' colorful metaphors, and the pacing is good. I like the comingeling of characters and the fact that one is a spy. 100 pages read out of about 320, and I still don;t know who that is."
5,Impressed,"Finished it over a month ago, and I've read three decent sci-fi books since... but I can't stop thinking about Hyperion."
3,An anti-climax to an otherwise engaging story.,"This book is mainly comprised of the tales told by each of the characters as they travel to the enigmatic planet of Hyperion, home of the fearsome Shrike, a god/demon who can manipulate time. Each of the tales is engrossing and very moving, however the larger tale of the pilgrimage to Hyperion in quest of the Shrike is unsatisfying because of the ambiguous non-ending which is an obvious ploy to get you to read the sequel. I believe that Hyperion should have had enough story to make it a stand alone novel, if that meant another 100 pages, then so be it. Because of the ending I deduct not one, but two stars since I feel it's a grave offense to the reader. Even so, I do recommend the novel for the original story and epic scale as well as the memorable characters."
4,Science fiction or science fantasy?,"An interesting, good read. I didn't find it predictable, or overly hokey. Simmons has a great imagination, a good sense of humor, and the ability to create believable characters. Warning: If you get 3/4 way through and decide you want to read the sequel, you better get it. Either that or get the Hyperion omnibus. This story leaves you with a real cliff-hanger.Most of this story consists of several characters explaining events of the past that lead them to their fate as pilgrims to Hyperion. It's kind of funny that long after the earth is dead, two people can identify a Yeats poem. I learned a lot about John Keats in this story too, the titles of the Hyperion quartet are taken from his poems. While all of this is quite odd, the character and plot development in this story is intriguing and enjoyable."
4,A brilliant prologue to Fall,"While I read this book I kept asking myself, when does the story start? Hyperion is the story of a group of pilgrims adventuring to the mystical Time Tombs. Every night another of them would tell the story of why they were there. This is a great premise, but not as a whole book. I found myself completely uninterested in the few smatterings of story between their tales. I found myself sometimes even skipping to the next persons story due to sheer boredom.While this book suffers as a standalone, it really shines as a 500 page proloque to Fall of Hyperion. Under normal situations I would have stopped with this series but a family member said that I should read Fall, even if just to understand. When read in succession, these two books have an amazing synergy that never ceases to amaze me. So if you plan to read this book, you'll want the other, so that you can dive into it ASAP."
4,"Great book, but the sequels drag a bit","Hyperion is a great book, but it is slightly flawed in that it leaves you hanging in a big way at the end. The sequels eventually tie up all the loose ends, but the series loses some momentum along the way. I still enjoyed reading the whole series, but Hyperion is the highlight of a long trip."
4,This book was really good,"This is one of the best books I have ever resd. It rivals the Ender's Game series and the Dune series for supremecy in the sci-fi realm. The only thing I dindn't like about this book was some of the stolen language, like Hegemon."
2,so-so,"D Simmons creates an interesting universe and the Canterbury Tales device works well. But the pretentious smugness of this book made it infuriating to read. Another reviewer had it spot-on when he said, ""the characters are present day Americans dressed up as denizens of the future"". There are just too, too many references to 19th and 20th century America to be believable. Shotguns, garden hoses...The Wizard of Oz? How would any of these characters know anything about such things?Maybe the Babylon 5 fans like such overwrought pap. I am astonished this won the Hugo award. The number of 5 star reviews here sadden me. Have they never read a decent book before? One in which the author doesn't club you over the head with his ""wealth of literary knowledge""?There was something good here, but it was smothered its own smugness."
2,Asimov reincarnate? Please.,"I inhale sci fi; the Foundation Series and Robot series are some of my favorite books of all time. Starship Troopers is another winner in my book. I read this tale with great anticipation--And found myself bewildered and let down.Confusingly told, badly written, poorly conceived- there's not a lot this book has going for it. As an outline, maybe; as a novel(ette), no way.Also one of the most anticlimactic books I've ever had the misfortune to delve into."
4,"Mostly gripping, with a few false notes","A mostly gripping story that's dragged down in a few places by politicaly correct storytelling.The PC stuff includes a military-commercial attack on an environmentally perfect world of people and dolphins. It also includes some female characters who seem forced. One of the major characters is supposed to be a female version of the private detective Sam Spade, only tougher. There's also tough- but-wise female leaders of the dolphin world and of the broader star systems. These characters are flat, at least compared to the surroundign action. Also, there's a throwaway reference to a male military character as a descendent of ""Palestinians."" The reference appears in a single paragraph and then disappears.In most stories with this kind of PC stuff, the silly politics sinks the art. This story is good enough to overcome it."
1,Pretentious twaddle,"I am astounded by the hysteria that surrounds this novel and its sequel. Quick frankly, I can't find a good thing about it. It is overwritten. It logically makes no sense whatsoever. John Keats, fine poet as he was, is hardly an apt figure for the ultimate savior of mankind. The science--ranging from tree ships to a super-Internet that be both (a) intelligent and (b) a transportation network (""It's a floor wax! It's a dessert topping!!"") is worse than embarressing. I literally forced myself though both volumes, with a ""this can't get any worse"" attitude--and it did. Be warned. If you like, say, the Charles Sheffield / Arthur Clarke / Isaac Asimov end of the spectrum, you will hate this. If you like fantasy and have no sense of logic, you might like it."
1,Ugh,"How does an author who cannot even write convincing dialog manage to win the Hugo? Don't ask me. The worst is the character Silenus, a crazy poet, who speaks like someone straight out of a B sci-fi movie. A couple of the stories are actually interesting but if you're into ""hard"" science fiction, don't even consider this book. Simmons is heavy on the speculative but low on scientific content. He should stick to writing horror."
2,not very original,"This book got such great reviews, I was expecting a lot more. All I got were rehashes of tired scifi storylines, a mix between not-so-scary lovecraft and star trek the original series with some graphic, violent sex thrown in. *shrug* I didn't care about anyone in the book enough to even finish the series - I had checked out a combined edition from the library. *yawn*"
2,The never ending story....,"I like Dan Simmons. ""Carrior Comfort"" is one of the best horror stories I have every read, so having seen so much praise for ""Hyperion"" I was eager to give it a try. I'll admit, I was one of the unaware that this was the first book of a two-part story, and that all this book covered was character backstory. This soured me on it to no end. I was expecting a story about what happens when the characters face the ultimate killing machine ""the Shrike"", not the long dull journey before hand. In the end, I wasn't moved enough to get the second book and would recommend getting ""Carrion Comfort"" instead."
3,Love/Hate relationship for Hyperion and me,"Five of the six stories are interesting (excepting the one by the poet, Martin Silenus - that was real junk); but overall the book spends way too much time describing scenery. It should be explaining the political and religious aspects that Simmons was trying (big emphasis on TRYING here...) to bring about. I had to skim sometimes up to 20 pages just out of boredom. Then the ending is a real ""hanger"" and answered nothing! Give me more stuff on the Shrike, the Ousters, and the AI's!!! Less crud about the color of people's anatomy and the sky and stuff. However, I did fully appreciate some of the very sexual/horrorific nature of this book. It was nice to see that aspect of humanity depicted in a sci-fi setting. I am undecided if I will read the next book. I think I will spend time on other authors first. I checked this book out at the library and recommend you do the same. Definately not worth paying for (you already pay enough with your time.)"
2,"What's all the hubbub, bub?","A couple of good yarns (the priest's tale is especially good), but otherwise nothing special. The stories are supposed to have a common thread that just isn't there. There is no ending. This is a rip-off. This book was obviously written with the intention of forcing you to buy the sequel. And from all I've heard, the next two books in the series are written in just the same way. Shine it on, big time"
3,Rich imagery -- but ultimately not gratifying,"I enjoyed this novel (at least until the end), and found that I had to finish it in a single sitting. But I won't read the rest in the series.On the good side:-Great opportunities for reader's visual imagination -Interesting nexus of science and religion -Varied stories - though they do tend to emphasize lossOn the bad side: -The book's ending. I'm really tired of books that can't tell a story in a volume. This book has no climax; essentially we're left with clues about what it's all been about. And, of course, we receive an invitation to read the next volume.I don't mind multi-volume epics, but I want gratification from each volume, not just a promise that there might be some in the next volume. I won't read the next volumes in the hope that they will deliver on that promise."
3,"and another, and another, and............................","Well written, with very good imagination and a good story line, however I grow tired with the age old formula of leaving readers ""hanging"". My frustration with this ""novel"", if you want to call it that, is that if you are writing these books with the intention of writing a sequel, at least create an arc in the story that can be finished, at the end. Basically, this is half of a novel. Spare us the attempt the grab us and slave us to your neverending story line. Even Rocky 1 through whatever had an individual story that was completed by the end of each movie. Maybe I am unjustly criticizing one author for something that has been widely practiced. As I said, I did enjoy the book, until the end. I will endeavor to read the next one, however, I see that there are a couple more in the ""series"" now, and if ""The Fall of Hyperion"" does not have some finality to it, then add another author to the ""Do Not Read"" list."
3,"Good book, bad ending","I really liked this book right up until the end. The worlds were interesting, the Shrike were interesting and creepy, he didn't give away their secret so I wanted to keep reading to find out more about them. I liked how he wove religion into the story throughout.What I didn't like was the ending. In fact, I was mad about it, to the point where I didn't want to read the next book. I expected something dramatic to happen, but it simply didn't fulfill my expectation. I am told that the later books will explain it, but I think it's important to give the reader SOMETHING, some reason why he/she went through 500 pages to the end."
4,"Some bad, some very good. Worth a read.","Hyperion is a book of somewhat uneven quality. The sentences have a short, irritating, grating feel sometimes. It's not the most polished of works.The story is in a somewhat unimaginative style where several pilgrims head off to Hyperion and get to hear each other's stories. There's a lot of fluff in Hyperion and the novel could have been cut down substantially.That said, some of the stories are very strange and powerful. The priest's story and that of the man with the child were very disturbing and left a strong impression. Those two alone make the book worth reading. The others were mixed, some ok, a couple very dull.Worth a read, but not a sci-fi great."
5,The most amazing piece of science fiction i ever read,A master pirce of science fiction. Anyone who likes sci-fi has to read this book.
5,One of the greats,"This book (and the successors in the series) manage the rare feat of being epic and intimate, combining aspects of hard SF, horror and fantasy. The plot and ideas are all stunning, the characters aren't bad, and Dan Simmons has a straightforward writing style that I like.It is certainly in the top 25 best SF stories I've ever read. Probably top 10. Maybe top 1."
5,Spectacular!!!,This ranks in the top 5 Sci Fi books I have ever read! A must for any serious reader of Sci Fi!!!
4,Hyperion,Hyperion is a powerful Science Fiction novel. Each of the pilgrims' stories are novels in themselves. Simmons take several great ideas and roles them into a great read. Only problem with this book is the constant sex scenes which kept it from getting a 10
3,Really needs an ending,"This is a well-written, but fairly gory book, good if you can follow all the story lines and can imagine your own ending. I've always lacked that skill, so it wasn't very satisfying for me."
5,Superb,"I have read all 4 books in the Hyperion series and they are by far some of the best books I have ever read. They keep you rigged from start to finish with continuous action and a gripping plot. Be sure to read Fall of Hyperion, Endymion, and Rise of Endymion if you like this book ;) ."
5,How does someone come up with this?,"I've traveled in the ""Fellowship"" books, and rode a worm in the Dune books. The Ender story is amazing, as I was there too, and I,ve seen the Ringworld from outside-in. These and other books can take us to places we would love to go. All of them great and well-loved, each universe a reality of the imagination. But as one reviewer put it ""this book (Hyperion) will make you feel something"", I couldn't have said it better. I may have wanted to try on a stillsuit, but Hyperion left me homesick. The Endymion books are PFG too. Very few people I've read have pulled off a 4-part story this well. For those of you who didn't like Hyperion, oh well your loss."
3,Poor electronic conversion,Well written story but the editing mistakes were very distracting. I assume this was due to conversion into electronic format.
5,Beautiful storytelling,"The book mirrors the basic plot and frame story structure of Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales. A widely disparate group of individuals are on a pilgrimage to a place which is gradually revealed as the focal point of impending doom. As the story unfolds, you learn more about each of the individuals' back-stories through a series of flashbacks. Each flashback is fascinating -- both because of the plot and because Dan Simmons excels at revealing a little bit more of the fascinating world. Strongly recommended."
4,Good read,"The book overall was good. The only thing I didn't like was graphic detail the author used to describe the sexual encounters. To me, they didn't really lend anything to the story and I just kind of bypassed them. Not that I am a prude (and not that there is anything wrong with being prude either!), but the details were bordering on pornographic and seemed out of place in the story."
5,Amazing,"I've been reading Amazon reviews for many years and have never chosen to contribute before. Hyperion, by Dan Simmmons, deserves a review. All at once mind-blowing, intimate, sad, reflective and essentially HUMAN makes this the best SF book I have ever read. I certainly never cried three quarters of the way through any other SF book before. This one is different - to all you non-Sci Fi fans, try this one - you may be surprised at just how makes you reflect upon what it means to be human."
5,Grand Sci Fi,With all of the detail and literary references Simmons comes close to being pretentious and self serving. He is saved by his obvious instinct to turn on the plot heat at just the right time. His sense of story allow him to be a bit pretentious and still escape those traps many other writers would have fallen into. This book could most easily be described as grand and ambitious and yet I ran through its pages like it was a comic. That is its brilliance.
5,not for a novice,"hyperion is an excellent book. the plot is very original, and intricate. the first book ofcourse does not answer any questions, but the sequel ties up all loose ends perfectly. if you are new to sci fi, this book is not for you. even a seasoned sci fi buff may need to read these books twice just to completely understand the plot. I think this would make a great movie or miniseries, espeacially the scenes with The Shrike in action. I highly reccomend this book."
5,Great Sci-fi,"Many of the less-than-flattering reviews of this book are centered around the ending (or lack there of). Certainly, not much is resolved in this book. But the six stories told by the main characters (blended with a ""current"" plot-line) are such superb sci-fi and such superb writing that it hardly matters that one needs to read another volume for some resolution. In fact I'm looking forward to it. This is one of the best sci-fi works I've ever read (in 30 years of reading sci-fi). Do yourself a favor... read this one."
2,bit of a let down,I had high hopes starting this one. I'm a fan of Gene Wolfe and Frank Herbert and this was recommended to me as being a work of similar character. I was expecting something with a bit more depth. Supposedly the second book wraps up the tale but... Meh.
5,Immense,"I can't believe I'm reading complaints about the first book being ""unfinished"".It's not meant to. We're talking about a serie.And those of you who think it ends with the Fall of Hyperion: you're wrong too. There are two more books, and if you cannot find out what they are, you don't deserve to read them.What can I add to all the reviews?The serie is a masterwork. It will be remembered.Not only it's awe-inspiring, it is deeply moving, too. I thought the Scholar's story was one of the most moving novels I had ever read. Parental love is so vividly depicted that.. man, I think it made me wish to have a daugther.Well, the end of the serie is even MORE moving.I emphatize these aspects because they're the ones I expected the least, from such books... the fact that is amazing, grand, daring, provoking science fiction almost becomes ""unsurprising"", as you progress through the pages...Sorry for my English anyway."
3,"Some great writing, but flawed","This book is great for its sub-plots. Each of the pilgrims' stories are great mini-dramas. Unfortunately, the book is obsessed with invoking the classic poetry of John Keats, which gets tiresome. The author also loves to throw in plot complications, to make the book feel denser I suppose. When these minor plot points are dropped and never resolved I feel like the author is trying to snow me instead of telling me a story."
2,I Spoke to Carsey Werner about this show!,I got a call from Paul Shrieber of Carsey Werner whose name I got from the review of season two. Mr. Shrieber called and nicely redirected me to Janet Bonnifer at 818-464-9618. She said that there are no plans for the other season to be released any time soon because of licensing issues regarding the songs used in some of the scenes. This is the reason why they have not be able to release it all these years. I have seen shows released with different music and/or songs than the original episodes because of the same reason. It was worth the try but I am no longer holding my breath for this. I will just have to get it from someone who has recorded them all from tv as I did before. The last set I got was flawed and I was unable to return it from Video MagicBox. I will try some other source.
4,Saved,I'd been looking for this in stores off and on in the month of December and even looked on some other sites that sell TV Series on DVD but A Different World was no where to be found. I was so happy to find it on Amazon. I loved the show when it was on and found another avid fan I wanted to give it to as a gift. Not only did I find it at a good price it arrived pre Christmas and I ordered it really late in December.
1,I only hope...,"That the powers that be don't hold back the other seasons based on the sales of Season 1. This is not a review of that season, most people here are honest enough to call a dog, a dog. So I won't go flogging a dead horse.The comments made hear are a strong enough indication to keep releasing the subsequent seasons of this great (except season 1...whoops, sorry!) show. (oh by the way, the form forces you to rate the dvd, I tried to leave it blank, so 1 star is being extremely generous on my part...that's becasue I'm a meanie!)So...bring 'em on!"
2,Can't Wait for seasons 2 and 3,"No Freddie! No Mr Gains! No Dr. War! No Kim! I use to love the Different World back in the late 1980s (watched every single episode - except that my mom wouldn't let me watch the attempted date rape episode from season 2 - episode 42, I finally watched that particular episode 6 years later on WB reruns). The main reason why I gave this dvd 2 stars is because Deniese butchered the season (she wasnt funny like she was on the Cosby Show). Jalessa was too uptight (she'll get funnier on season 2) and Whitley and Ron (not shown enough)was not that funny for this season, but will be hilarious by season 2. Not only this season was too weak and serious, but I also didnt buy this dvd because I was afraid of the editing scenes (like they did on the dvd releases of Cosby show and In Livin' Color - SHAME ON THEM!). Right now, I'll just hold my money until they release seasons 2 and 3 cuz they were the funniest seasons."
2,not very good,"Lisa Bonet was like watching wallpaper in this show. She had no charisma or charm at all. She was so much better in the Cosby show. She must have hated it when Jasmine Guy was in front of the camera, she acted rings around Lisa. Heck the actress who played Millie held my interest more than Lisa did. She should have stayed on the Cosby show. Good thing she got pregnant so the producers didn't have to fire her. There is no way this show would have lasted if she had stayed the star."
3,You Have To Start Somewhere,"I am so happy that A Different World will be released. Looking back, I remember rushing home to see this incredible show. Just as others have said, the 1st season was not all that great, but you have to start somewhere. It was an evolution from mediocre to great. You get a chance to see Dwayne evolve from geek to someone who was able to tame Whitley Gilbert (not an easy feat). We get to see Jada Pinkett before see was Jada Pinkett Smith. When Lisa Bonet left, no one was sure what direction the show would take, but it only gave the supporting cast a chance to shine... Thanks Lisa! I look forward to the release of the remaining seasons. Get ready for an amazing journey!"
1,Buyer Beware,"These 22 episodes are the edited, chopped and truncated syndicated version of Season 1 (my favorite season). Entire scenes from each show have been left out leaving horrible gaps in storylines, great jokes and episode conclusions. As someone who never missed a show during the 1987-88 season (after that, the series was overcrowded and kinda' ghetto)I know these freshman episodes featuring the gentle comic stylings of Lisa Bonet like the back of my hand and trust me, anyone who buys this pathetic package is being shortchanged. I await the day the full, original episodes are restored and released, because this is a shoddy bit of product. Stay Away."
2,Hold On,"This TV show was the impetus for me to research--and finally attend--a historically Black college. This show seemed to capture the seriousness, quirkiness, and joy of going away to a college that prided itself on helping students find their own identity. From Dwayne Wayne to Colonel Taylor, each character was authentic and real to me. They addressed so many touchy subjects: interracial dating, family pressures, grassroots activism, rape, colorism, minstreling, and everywhere in between. Though, like the others, I don't think this first season is indicative of the whole show, I have been waiting patiently for A Different World to come out on DVD and I believe that it was truly a beautiful experience. I hope they don't stop releasing this show on account of season one. It truly grows and matures, just like its audience."
4,Great bonus disc,"I bought the first season of A Different World dvd because I am a huge fan of this show! Even though the first season was my least favorite of all, I still enjoyed the dvd and especially the bonus disc. I absolutely love seeing bloopers of my favorite show and so that was a highlight! It looks like the cast had such a good time together. Ironically, none of the bloopers were from season 1, which was great b/c the rest of the seasons were so much better, but seeing the bloopers from later episodes made me really miss the show even more and wish that the rest of the seasons were available on dvd! I also like the behind the scenes documentary on the bonus disc too. It was cool to see some of the actors get together and reminisce about the show and they also included footage from rehearsals, which was nice to get a glimpse of. I just want to see more!!!! Please release seasons 2-6!!!!!!"
3,A show has to start some where,"I loved a different world, it was one of my favorite shows; but like many others have already stated, the first season wasn't the best. Lisa Bonet, who is great on the Crosby Show, just couldn't hold tight to a show of her own. The best change that happened was her leaving and letting Jasmine Guy & Kaheem Harrison take the spotlight; because it was these two, along with many others, that made the second season and beyond, a run home and watch, show. The first season wasn't really humorus but it's a good start to learn the 3 characters that would make ""A diiferent world"" the great sitcom it becomes. So I would buy it, just to start my collection"
5,THANK YOU! IT'S ABOUT TIME,"I'm cannot tell how pleased I am about the pending release of a wonderful educational show. The series was shot on the campus of my present school Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia. This was more than just a tv show. It taught life lessons as well as historical ones. This show along with the Cosby show introduced me and others to black history, art, music,literature, life and culture. The blacker the college the sweeter the knowledge."
3,ABOUT TIME,I only give this season 3 stars only because this wasn't my fav season. I loved A Different World from season 2 till the very last episode. But I will be getting this DVD just because this is one of my all time fav television show.
3,About Time,I'm a fan of the show but the second season all the way to the last was better. The whole Dwayne & Whitley saga kind of bought the show out and made it even better.
5,Memories,"I purchased this DVD for my husband (as a present) because he's crazy about this sitcom. However, I was a bit disappointed that the other seasons are not available. Nevertheless, he's happy with season one. The quality is perfect."
3,The Edited Version,"My favorite episode of Season 1 is ""Rudy and the Snow Queen"". I taped and watched it over and over as a kid. So I was excited to be able to see it again. Unfortunately, the episodes are edited and the scenes I loved most were cut out. Like when Rudy dances at The Pit, and when she tells Denise ""Hey is for horses Denise."" Oh well."
2,not happy,I have ordered Tresor perfume online before and been very happy with it. I decided to order a bottle recently. Price was way up from last time and to top it off you can hardly smell it. Not happy at all with my purchase. I will not order this again.
5,"Great island read, Love it","This is a really fun book to read. If you have any knowledge of Tortola, BVI you will not find a better more enjoyable book that has so many near facts that you now exactly who the author is talking about. I first pick up my copy at Soper Hole on Frenchman's Key West End BVI while sailing the area. I'm not a ""fast"" reader, slow in-fact. It was hard to put the book down while anchored off Yost Van Dyke and finished in two settings. I've introduced this book to friends and some local authors who all loved the book.I'm sure that initially Julian Putley was reluctant to enter the BVI after the book was published! Far too many high falootin people are very identifiable and were harpooned in fun in the book! Great Read!"
4,Essential BVI reading....,"So I'm sailing along the leeshore of Cooper Island with our Skipper from a Tradewinds charter and begin discussing the business opportunities available in the BVI's. He tells me that he's written a fictional book touching on the experiences of foreigners who have attempted to do just that. His name was Julian Putney and he just so happened to have a copy on hand. I read it almost non-stop and was immediately asking about the sequel. I'm told it's coming. If you're looking for a hilarious and insightful story about the modern day BVI's, read this book. He has also written the definitive ""Drinking Man's Guide to the BVI"", and a wonderfully rich historical short story, ""The Virgin's Treasure Isle""."
5,Beautiful Illustrations,"My children and I make a habit to read poetry several times a week. I thought the old fashioned wording of these poems would have distracted them to disinterest but that in not the case. They LOVE this book. I think part of the reason is the illustrations include children and are vibrant with colors. Though I thoroughly enjoy my Kindle, this needs to be read with the real hard-covered book in hand."
5,A Child's Garden of Verses,I was looking for the book Now We Are Six by A.A. Milne and ran across this one. It surprised me as I often mention it and think about reading it when I was a young girl in the 1950's. I still have my original copy given to me when I was six at Christmas by my parents.I loved it then and will read it to my grandchildren now. Great book! I am so glad it is still available for today's children (and their parents and grandparents) to enjoy.
2,Artist rather than writer focus.,I was distressed with how many of the poems from the original Garden of Verses had been eliminated. I was more interested in the writing and would have prefered all of the text from the original.
5,A Child's Garden of Verses,"The moment my first grandson was born, I could not wait until he was old enough for me to read this wonderful book to him. It's time! The book was given to me when I was 4 and I still can recite most of the poems from memory. The poems and stories of Robert Louis Stevenson are simply the best. If there is a child in your family.....A Child's Garden of Verses is a MUST!"
4,(At least as far as he is able),"A 1001 CBYMRBYGU.I'm obligated to read all of Stevenson's oeuvre. My school is named after this man.This book contains a variety of short poems for children written by RLS himself. The poems range from the proscriptive:""A child should always say what's trueAnd speak when he is spoken to,And behave mannerly at table;At least as far as he is able.""To:""The world is so full of a number of things,I'm sure we should all be as happy as kings."""
4,A Child's Garden of Verses,I used this book for a child case study and my child loved the poetry in this book. I would say that it is a must have.
4,ONLY ONE SOURCE FOR THIS BOOK,YOU CAN GET THIS BOOK ONLY FROM THE HOMETOWN BOOK STORE IN DAHLONEGA GA 706-864-7225. WE PAID TO HAVE IT REPRINTED AND BOUGHT THE ENTIRE PRINTING.
5,Worked for me!,"I used this my entire pregnancy and only got VERY slight stretch marks around my belly button and they have almost completely gone away by now. I swear by this product. It really worked for me. Just use it EVERY DAY! Oh, and I didn't have any itching at all."
4,so that's what lawyering is all about....or not,"I enjoyed this book.The first 90% sometimes ran a bit slow....the difficulties of being a ""first-year"", an ""associate"" or a ""partner"" in a law firm. It was interesting, and the story threads of the two cases kept me reading. These days, I sometimes do stop reading a book because I was not interested; that was not the case in this one. I wanted to read it through to the end to see where the characters were going, and how the cases would be resolved.I did think, however, that in the first 90% of the book, the author was setting a scene for his concluding chapters, and that the concluding chapters came too quickly. The story became relatively complete, but in its conclusion it felt like too much too fast...based on the previous chapters.I did like the book (Thank you Amazon, I think that comment is permissable in your reviews) and intend to read his next."
2,Cumbersome...........and wordy........,"Subject matter had potential, but it never seemed to flow smoothly. Finished book, but wish I had spent the time on another............."
4,Old virtues with modern sensibility,"This book can be a difficult reading unless the reader is situated in a similar milieu. Each thought described in each sentence displays a flash of brilliance but characters in the story blend into one another without much distinction. I'll have to heed Professor Kermit Roosevelt's notations paraphrased here by me as something like (1) succeeding is energizing, exhilarating and satisfying but success is empty and also (2) a society person is bound by tiny thread of custom and duty and so at minimum he risks being ridiculed by community if he aims and achieves wholesale reorganization of personal lives."
3,Glad I'm not a lawyer,"It was interesting and easy to read, but not so compelling I couldn't put in down. The romantic parts were chaste, too use an old-fashioned term. I have not recommended the book to anyone else."
2,Wordy,"Too wordy. A bad Steinbeck imitaion. Slow moving, usually I can read and understand at a fast pace, not able to really ""get into"" this novel. Would not recommend the book."
1,Will never make you an avid reader of legal thrillers,"I read them all. Grishim, Turrow, etc. Kermit has a good understanding of the legal process, as he should. There is so much legaleze, the characters go undeveloped. The plot is thin and never really grabs you. Some of the sub plots are so trivial, they go nowhere.Kermit, you have the talent. Now that you have written your book that first year law students could learn from, go write the next one for the rest of us."
5,not your run of the mill thriller,"Entertainment Weekly put this book on its ""Must List,"" praising its ""complex and believable characters."" The plot is interesting, but what's distinctive is the characters and the different views they have of the law. Well worth reading."
5,outstanding!,"Rebeccasreads highly recommends THE SHADOW OF THE LAW as a first class debut novel & a powerfully elegant read, offering a deep look into the workings of top American law firms. The two lives of a lawyer -- the personal & the professional are also craftily highlighted. However, because of the legalese, this book will probably be better enjoyed by readers well-versed in law, or have a passion for legal-fiction. Not your usual travel or vacation read -- THE SHADOW OF THE LAW is meant to be savored, relished & enjoyed."
4,legal mystery for lawyers,I tend to agree with parts of the one and five star reviews. The technical legal jargon can be overwhelming at times but not too much to take away from the intimate character portrayals. The plot lacks a little in the middle then picks up at the end. This novel is a good read but more legal philosophy than story. It's hard to tell if the author is writing for the layman or trying to impress the layman with his legal rhetoric. All in all it was a smart and in depth novel. I liked it.
3,Convoluted legal thriller,"Heard IN THE SHADOW OF THE LAW, a convolutedlegal thriller by Kermit Roosevelt that didn't really hold myinterest . . . it is about the lives of men and women ata prestigious law firm who tackle cases involving the deathpenalty and a class action involving a prominent biochemicalfirm . . . there didn't seem to be anything that I hadn't read before,though Roosevelt's writing did give me a feel that I was learningat least a little something about the legal profession . . . I did likethe narration by Craig Wasson, an underrated actor who youdon't see nearly enough on screen."
1,"Diamonds too small to see, Band too thin.","This ring I ordered because I loved their Jessica Simpson replica, however it is uncomparable. The main diamond is on the large size however, the diamonds all around the wedding band and engagement ring are so tiny you need a magnifying glass to see them. Additionally, the wedding band width is SO THIN, it is obvious that it is not real. The silver is also too shiny making it look cheap. I did not return the item, good enough for wearing around the kids. I would NOT go out of the house with this one... not worth it in my opinion. I was very disappointed."
2,Not worth the money,The ring turns your finger green which is quite embarrasing. The cz is loose in its setting and actually makes a small rattling noise. I tried never to get any water on the ring and it still looks dull and has lost it's sparkle after only two months. I know it was less than $50 but I have purchased other cz rings that hold sparkle and shine for years. This set should be priced at around $20
3,Oppression of the Distress,"The novel is a web of personal conflict by which the characters tried to resolve. However, as they tried to resolve their personal dilemmas, they ended up in a draw of string brought about by prejudice and racism that holds them throughout the Third Life of Grange Copeland."
4,A book that can play havoc with your emotions,"Even though I thoroughly enjoyed reading ""...Grange Copeland,"" I felt it was another version of ""The Color Purple"" minus the lesbian story-line. The male characters are harsh (much more so than the male characters in ""The Color Purple"") and relentless, but as in ""The Color Purple"" Ms. Walker tries to make the reader feel that they do have a ""human"" side. The female characters are strong-willed...as most of the female characters in ""...Purple"" were. What I enjoy most about Ms. Walker is she makes the reader feel so much a part of each character's life. The ending is somewhat a disappointment, i.e., comes too fast and too abrupt."
2,Quite a disappointment...,"I have heard that Alice Walker is an incredible writer, which may be true (it is forgivable, since this was her first novel), but I found The Third Life of Grange Copeland to be extremely disappointing. First of all, I expected more quality in it -- this read like a soap opera story. This is why I shy away from best-sellers, but I thought Walker might be different. I can see her strengths in writing, but I do not even feel as if a vivid portrait of anything was painted. The characters, the home, the reasons behind many of the abrupt actions were all left unanswered. After putting up with that plot throughout the book, I expected a decent ending (I stuck it out). However, the ending was the worst part, as it came suddenly and then the novel was over. I still plan on reading other books by Alice Walker, but I would not recommend this one to anyone demanding a good plot."
3,Not a happy book,"This is a beautifully written, eye-opening tale of life for poor blacks in the mid-twentieth-century South. I highly recommend it for lending perspective to the lives of oppressed people. However, it is an EXTREMELY DEPRESSING book, particularly for a white person who wishes her own race to be less horrible to others."
4,Great Novel,"This is a great read. I would recommend it for anyone that enjoys reading about racial challenges, suspense, romance, scandal, etc... Classic novel by this author."
2,"(1.5 stars) Sorry, Trane... even geniuses have their off days","I never thought Trane knew the meaning of the word ""sappy"": all of his ballads not found on this album were done in excellent taste. However, some of these ballads are done in horrible taste, such as the schlocky, made-for-Vegas ""Too Young to Go Steady""; a so-mellow-it-hurts ""I Wish I Knew"", a keyboard lounge piano solo to open ""What's New"", and the gratingly repetitive ""Say It (Over and Over and Over and Over and Over and Overandoverandoverandoverandover Again)"". He does do Sinatra's ""All or Nothing at All"" justice, giving it a slightly danceable rhythm and upping the tempo beyond ""crawl"" for a change. This is unimaginative, monotonous background music (I could've sworn that ""Nancy (With the Laughing Face)"" had the exact same melody as ""It's Easy to Remember"") to be avoided even by Coltrane junkies like me. And I know Coltrane deserves a high rating than a star and a half. If only this had never existed..."
4,Good quality for the money,"I think this is the product set that I just received as a gift. It's obviously not from Eden on Cape Cod but very similiar. It's a very delicate, simple set and looks very nice on. It seems to be of pretty decent quality too."
4,Good deal,"I bought this ring for my grandma's birthday. Its a good sized ring, but looked real nice on her ring finger. If your purchasing this for someone with smaller hands I would suggest their index or middle finger as the ring itself is quite large."
4,"""Does he ever go wrong?????""","Back again with another excellent, smooth-sounding Cd.With Will Downing, what you see is what you get, and that is a good thing. I own every album by him, and have never been dissatisfied by anything he has ever put out. Keep on doin' your thing Will. It always sounds good, and feels good to hear someone still doin ""Real Music"" for us ""real music lovers""."
4,Pretty Good,"I thought this cd was good, but not as good as All the Man You Need. There are no songs that really pull at my heart strings, yet Will's voice is so great, I would rate it 3.5 stars and 5.0 for his voice! See him live, it will be well worth it :-)"
4,Feel Good Music,"Will is by far my favorite artist so I may be a little partial but this CD is beautiful. It's classic Will but only better. My favorite songs are ""Maybe"" and ""Brooklyn Breezes"". Whatever aches or pains or stress you have when you put this CD on, it will surely be gone by the middle of the first song! Buy the CD and let the Doctor Downing soothe you."
5,Awesome CD,"I have always loved Will Downing from the first time I heard his remake of the Angel Bofill hit, ""I Try."" He really nailed it with this CD. I already have a couple of favorites and they are ""I Can't Help It"" and ""Maybe."" This man should be called the ""Remake King."""
5,Hot and Sexy,It drove girlfriend wild. She really loved it. Put it on right away. Perfect fit. She was very happy. Very nice looking and good quality.
2,The FIT & FABRIC! Disappointed...,"There's only one reason that made me not like this product, the way it fits at the waist area. I'm a size small in dresses for reference and I'm 5'1. It did not hug the waist area and the curve of my back. There was a big space that just goes straight up without hugging tight to your waist. I think its because of the fabric or maybe because i have a small waist and a big butt. My waist is 23inch and hips/butt 38inch. But i really think its the fabric. I have other fishnets and they all hug tightly without leaving a space. And I also had to stretch it length wise to fit correctly, so I'm not sure this will fit taller people."
3,Not as Pictured,"I mainly bought this item based on the picture on the website and the brief desciption included below it. It led me to believe that there were no attached screen walls and would be appropriate for the beach. This was not the case. I did not assemble it, but could see that there were indeed stiched in screen walls and seemed to be a floor as well. This would not be an appropriate tent for a sun shelter at the beach, but would be appropriate for a screened in cover. Quality seemed to be good, but website information was misleading. I was disappointed that I have to pay return shipping since apparently it was ""my mistake""."
5,film with a mistake,There is a mistake in the amazon's film information. The language is italian with english subtitles
5,So Glad I Got It,"Of coarse I have heard of St. Anthony, but I really didn't know who he was. I am VERY picky with what movies I watch. I will go to other sites and read reviews, and even check to see if EWTN sells it. While browsing movies for saints on Amazon, I took the risk and purchased it. First of all I didn't know it was subtitled, I guess I missed that in the summary. So be ready to read! But to get to the point... I am SO glad I got this movie. I highly recommend it. It is very inspiring and St. Anthony has been added to my list of favorite saints. Also good writing and good acting."
4,Entertaining and Inspiring,"This movie is entertaining as well as inspiring. It shows that St. Anthony's humanity drew him toward holiness. He wasn't shown as a plastic Saint, but someone who had doubts, pride, questions and a struggle like everyone else."
3,I bit short,"Very complete in the biographical aspects, but a bit short around his work as a Franciscan monk. I was left wanting more about his spiritual life. aa"
4,"It was very good and touched me spiritually,which is what I wanted.",This is for all Christians to see or anyone seeing how good some persons can be to others. Loved the miracles.
5,Outstanding!,I enjoyed this movie and find it to be an outstanding movie! Can't wait to share it with my family.
4,A good war story in space.,"Moscoe has a nice clean writing style that provides just the right level of detail to form his universe and the fighting situations. I enjoy a good sci-fi war story and the author provides it. The central characters are divided between a ground based marine fighting unit and a ship based ""naval"" unit, and the two story lines merge to climax a good tale."
3,"Seemed ""average"" to me.....","Good space battles between ships, but some of the physics involved seemed ""wrong"" to me. Maybe I shouldn't gripe about physics in a book involving FTL space flight, but when a ship accellerates at 3 gees for several days, it should have to decellerate at the same rate for the same time as well. Too often the ships just seem to come to a stop, or at least the author doesn't describe that several days of braking were involved. Minor gripe? Possibly, and I for one could have done without the sappy and cliche drama of Major Longknife and his wife as well. It's an okay book if you're just looking for some mindless entertainment, but thought-provoking, it is not."
5,Great Resource Guide for Parents,I think this little book is great for parents to use with their pre-verbal infant/toddler. It is small and compact enough to be carried around in their diaper bag plus it has signs that are meant for the vocabulary needs of young children.
5,Wonderful resource!,"I am a licensed sign language interpreter and baby sign language instructor - and this is by far the best resource I have seen for parents and caregivers that use sign language with their children.Finally a book that parents and caregivers can use with all the signs in one place! I especially love the memory aids to help remember the signs.I've ordered a ton for all my clients!Kristine AlarieExpressive Hands, LLC"
5,Wonderful Signing Book,"I love this dictionary!!! It has every word that I have wanted to look up for my signing baby boy. I bought the Sign With Your Baby book first and I needed more signs for my son. I found this book on Amazon.com and I love it. It has 500 signs(American Sign Language) in it just for babies and little kids. It has Mc Donalds, dinosaur, wagon and so many more signs. I can't say enough about this little book. I carry it around with me so when my son needs to know a sign like when he pointed to a bird in the Target parking lot, I pulled out the book and found the sign for bird. I was able to show him the sign right there when he needed it. I recommend this book to anyone that is signing with their child. It has reminders on almost every sign to help me remember how to sign the word. It is a great book to keep around even after the baby gets older and wants to learn sign language on their own. Elementary kids would love to have this book as a resource."
5,Highly recommended,"This book is great. The signs are totally useful for those with little kids, the illustrations are wonderful, and the tips to help you remember the signs are great!"
5,Exceeded Expectations,"This book is very clear and easy to use. It exceeded my expectations. The illustrations are clear, the words are simple. I just started 3 days ago and my 9 month old pays attention to my hand movements when I make the signs as if he understands. It is really fun to communicate to my son with sign language and it makes me feel good knowing there is more than one way to commuicate."
5,Wonderful book! Thrilled I bought it!,"I am thrilled that I chose this book and ordered it to teach my daughter sign language. The illustrations, descriptions, and reminders/tips are excellent for helping me learn them and then show them to my daughter. Plus that it is in alphabetical order, makes it really easy to find that one word that I am looking for. I would definitely recommend this book to any parent wanting to teacher their child signing."
5,Beautiful,"Thest Waterford flutes are absolutely beautiful. I know that some may think they are a little pricey, but its worth it. They make a great bride/groom flute glass for the wedding reception. Also, its a great remembrance of your day!They are so cute!"
5,Waterford flutes,I bought these for my daughter and son-in-law for use at their wedding reception. They are lovely and were a big hit!
3,Okay,"This product was okay, but I wasn't particularly pleased. One of the glasses was flawed. The price was great and essentially, I got what I paid for, but I won't consider buying this line again."
2,Made in China & not impressed with quality,"I didn't like these glasses at all. First of of all they're made in China says so right on the box. Secondly the pink box is cheesy. The first time I opened it the bottom part of the buckle fell off and hit the floor. I had to push the tabs back in. Then when I put the lid back down one corner ripped. I wasn't being rough either. When I was cleaning the glasses off with a tissue to see if I liked them better there was a chip in the glass at the top, I could feel with my fingernail. I also think they look quite cheap. I wanted to look at them before buying but I couldn't find them anywhere so I took a chance. I honestly don't even think they're worth the price, I could get a cheaper glass that looks more expensive and has better quality. I got them for a my best friends wedding but I'm too embarrassed to give them to her so I'm returning and getting something else."
5,"Beautiful Product, Great Service from Macy's","I recieved the flutes in a beautiful gift box. I opened the box just to look at them, before giving them as a gift. One flute was broken in two places on the stem. I was disappointed; but Macy's was great about recieving the return, at no cost to me."
2,Utterly out of Sympathy,"I read this book as a senior in highschool and I am not going to complain but ...When I began the Awakening, I expected to enjoy it. The opening description of the resort and Loisiana were wonderfully lush - beautiful simple language. But the book was really ruined for me because I could find absolutely no sympathy or even interest in the protagonist. In the end, I felt that she was rather selfish and petty. Her awakening to me wasn't much."
3,Self- absorbed~~~~!,"Chalk off another classic that I expected I might like much more than I actually did!Edna Pontellier came across like a woman who was totally ""self-absorbed"" more than an early 'feminist' in the truest sense.Her husband observes ""He thought it very discouraging that his wife, who was the sole object of his existence, evinced so little interest in things which concerned him, and valued so little his conversation.""She valued so little...even her children, that I couldn't find any sympathy for Ms Edna Pontellier or her longing for passion than eluded her because she didn't seem capable of giving of herself in truth to anyone.But the writing was rather engaging in places and so I gave it 3 stars instead of 2."
3,"Was it Oscar Wilde who wrote,","""the day a woman gets married is the day she dies""? Apparently so for Edna, Emma (Bovary), and Anna (Karenina), etc. --although it may take some time for them to realize it. Whether a great book or trash; whether male or female; or, whether feminist or not, is there a lesson here? Perhaps to make the best of the lives of those around us? Lets at least give Chopin that."
2,"DOES THIS REMIND YOU OF, SAY, FLAUBERT?","I am giving this novel such a low rating because of its blatant unoriginality. The similarities between Flaubert's Madame Bovary and Chopin's The Awakening is more than I can ignore. Take the plot, for instance. Married woman finds herself bored and dissatisfied with her station in life. Woman seeks man for satisfaction, enjoys herself guiltily for a while, then relationship ends. Woman becomes despondent for a while, realizes she will never become happy so ends it with suicide.It is this basic idea that haunts both Madame Bovary and The Awakening. There are a few trivialities that are different, but the plot of Chopin's is entirely unoriginal."
4,"Good point, no morals.","My 10th grade english teacher made me read this book this year, and in a way I thank him. I think The Awakening had a lot of good points to it. However, I didn't like the way Mrs. Pontellier went around flirting with any guy that walked her way. She could of kept the idea of being passionate a little more private. It was wrong to cheat on your husband back then and it still is. Some things never change. However, it was good that Chopin showed by the ending especially, how difficult it was to except and live with the idea that divorce was totaly not excepted. Over all I think Chopin wrote an excellent book, I just didn't like the idea that she was being so rude to her family, her husband, kids, and sister. That was wrong. Especially with what she did with the kids."
2,"Quick read, but not too pleasant","I think that this is a good book to have read to get a different perspective on feminism at the turn of the century, but it bothered me greatly while I was reading it. The main character, Edna, is SO selfish, childish, and self-absorbed that I can't see why the novel is so highly acclaimed as a piece of feminist literature. Perhaps it is because a woman takes the main role. Perhaps it is because of the sexual images that do not relate to men. I consider myself a feminist, but I had little respect for Edna or for this book."
2,Hated it! (See review for why it got two stars...),"Of all the femi-nazi literature that my teacher shoves down my throat, this was certainly the least tolerable. Devoid of any interesting subject matter, this book challenges the reader to make it through without expunging his most recent meal from his system. This book, however, has its pluses. If you need to strike up a conversation with someone of the female ilk, just toss this one out there...apparently women are born with a desire to read insipid and boring books such as this one, so you're sure to hit a home run. Happy reading!"
1,Chopin really was ahead of her time...,"Upon examination of this book, I agree that Chopin is a writer ahead of her time. She would be more apt to write in the 1990's where cheesy romance novels and Danielle Steele reign supreme. This book is horrid in every aspect of the word and could only be made worse if she mispelled several words including the title and made a plethora of grammatical errors. It is a bland plot mixed with bland character development that is built on a stupid premise that makes me feel stupider now that I have read the book. In fact, I think the CIA dropped these books on Russia to create a brain drain in the nation. In the words of the immortal Jay Sherman: ""It Stinks!"""
3,Mehh,"Compared to most of the books we have to read in AP Language, this book isn't so bad. Yes, it's a little dry at times, but once you get past the boring stuff, (the first 2/3) it starts to pick up."
4,The Awakening,"Kate Chopin's novel 'The Awakening' is a clear portrayal of a woman's sexual and spiritual awakening. Chopin shows the transofmation of Edna Ponterllier, a young wife and mother who-with tragic consequence-refuses to be caged by married and domestic life and claims for herself moral and erotic freedom. I very much enjoyed this book, because it intends to show that a twenty-eight year-old woman's desire to break herself free from societal confinements, with little experience, is possible."
1,Giving up on life,"I'm offended that people consider this book a feminist statment. It is not a statment, it is a pity party. The language and imagery of the book was decent enough.But Edna did not supply the book with the heroine it needed. She considered only herself, ironically accusing Robert of selfishness. In her ""awakening"" she was totally self-absorbed. If this book is meant to empower women what is it meant to drive then towards? Suicide? She gave up on life and love. If I could I would have given it 0 stars."
4,A few thoughts from a highschool senior...,"In this beautiful but sad story, the author succeeds in portraying in a tragically enchanting way the story of a child, thrust upon marriage not by love, but as an adventure. In time she awakens to the truth, she discovers new things, and new people that make her feel things she had never before felt. In a sense, it criticizes a society that does not allow for women to grow and mature, but treats them as goods. The style has a very agreeable rhythm, with very clear influences from naturalism. The environment is a beautifully rendered 19th century Louisiana and it certainly enhances the story,giving it a nice fancy atmosphere. I personally recommend this book to anyone if you're into romance novels, but I encourage all young women to read it since it will probably make you think twice before jumping into marriage, which in my humble opinion, is something that requires to be thought of much more than twice..."
4,Krista's book review,"The book ""The Awakening"" was pretty interesting. It kept my attention the whole time and I wanted to keep going to find out what happened next. The story line was amazing and I couldn't believe what happened at the end. I think it was cool how she wanted to be independent, but I think she became selfish and her affairs eventually took over her life. All in All, it was a good book and I suggest reading it."
3,Not outstanding.,"I read this book for an American literature course that dealt with books that had been banned or censored. While I can clearly see why this book fell into this category (it deals with the liberation of women from male-dominated society), I was not greatly impressed by it.While Chopin does a fair job of giving details of the thought processes of Edna, one does not become as enlightened or ""awakened"" as one would hope upon reading this book. The book's ending leads one to feel that there really is no awakening or escape for women from the traps of the rules imposed by the male-dominated society.Overall, I felt this book was not terrible, but certainly was not remarkable either."
2,I have read much worse stuff.,"I had to read this book in my Women's Writing Class. I can not say I enjoyed this. Edna does not really capture much sympathy or admiration. The pace of this is also quite sluggish. The supporting characters are not really memorable either. But at least Chopin had a good idea. She was trying to portray a woman who had everything, but could not be happy with the role of women in society. If you want to check this out, you must keep this in mind, or the book may seem meaningless. I did not really care for this, but I remember reading many books that were MUCH worse."
2,The Awakening,"Kate Chopin's writing is very detailed and some what mind boggling. You really need to be interested in the story in order to keep up with what the writer is saying. I found myself drifting from the book, chapter by chapter."
3,It Gets Better...,"The first time through this book for my Summer Reading, it was soooooooooooo boring - worse than the driver's ed manuel! However, after studying it in class, going through the backround, and exploring the characters - I like the book much more. I still think Edna's a pathetic character. Her situation is bad, but she didn't have to make the worst of it."
4,Beautifully written.,"This is one of those books that remind you what literature is about and how powerful it is. It is a terrible injustice to limit literature, such as this book, by catagorizing it into a certain type of ideology, or to attach moral judgement. If so, there wouldn't be any good literature left.(defenitely no Lolita) The awakening of one's soul and desire inspite of the external restraints, and the determination to bring changes in life, however tragic it may be, should speak to every human being. A Lovely book in all senses."
4,Strange but surprising experience,"As a teenage male I shuddered at the thought of having to read this book about female independence. I am happy to admit that The Awakening was much more than a feminist handbook. It was sensitive and thought-provoking, but it was also coldly realistic. This book will enlighten anyone who reads it, young or old, male or female"
3,About the book Awakening,"The book is well written and is a feminist classic but I would've recommend it. There are so many important, worthwhile books I hate to waste time on one that is so,so. As a feminist myself this book is just a rehash."
3,great cd,This was a great book. I enjoyed it and also purchased one as a gift for a friend. I would reccommend it.
2,Not a great read.,The Awakening did not hold my attention. It was a light read and the ending was predictable. Would not recommond for the serious reader.
2,Dispensable,"In this brief novel, Kate Chopin tries to depict the spiritual awakening of a privileged young woman. Unfortunately, the book doesn't make much sense. When Edna, the protagonist, casts away her public self to become her true self, we might suppose that her quality of life would improve. Instead she exercises poorer and poorer judgment, ultimately destroying herself. Edna is not a likeable or even an authentic character, and the supporting cast is almost as unattractive. In this novel, even New Orleans seems to have no attractions. The Awakening is not terrible; it just has little to offer."
1,What's so good about this book?,"This book has been called a masterpiece by many literary scholars, but I failed to see what's so good about it. The irony lies in the fact that it's difficult to stay awake during The Awakening."
3,Good for a nap,"I wouldn't have read this book without needing to for my class, but I wasn't completely disappointed. As a book that is influential in the women's movement of the early 1900s, it's not the worst. I really like the short stories by Kate Chopin, but the novel just doesn't seem to go anywhere. The awakening that the main character goes through is not as entertaining as it could have been. Also, it was very controversial during the time that it was written because of the affair that the main character has, but for today's standards it's not as shocking and therefore not as interesting."
2,Really disappointing ending,"This book has a lot of really strong points. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say that I thought Edna was a stronger character, but the ending was weak."
5,an interesting read,"I was forced to read this book in AP English my senior year, but I actually found it intriguing once I got into the plot and became familiar with the characters. What I really liked was how Chopin had every setting match the mood that the character felt; everything that surrounded the characters was symbolic of their emotions or what they were feeling, especially when it focused on Edna. Anyone could identify with her situation if they concentrate on the book with an open mind, and it is basically a look at the thoughts/emotions of a Creole woman who finds herself in an affair, but the book has many more elements to it that make it mean much more than a typical love & infidelity story. I would suggest reading it slowly and thinking about the reasons behind the characters' actions and dialogue, everything means something and this way the reader gets more out of the book. :)"
4,Classic Book,"While this book is a great classic book, it did not seem to be new when I got it. Other than that, the book is great!!!"
4,The Awakening,"The book came in just a few days, as promised, in great shape. My daughter is reading it for a school assignment, and while not exactly something she chose, we are happy we ordered it on Amazon!"
1,Some Heroine,"Woman marries man, woman cheats on man. Woman has children, woman abandons children. Woman kills herself. Man stays with children, and fulfils his commitments to family while financing woman's ""awakening."" I think we need to reexamine how the heroes and villains are in this book. One star."
1,The Awakening-put me to sleep,"What has long since its first printing been regarded as a rather risque oeuvre is hardly that today and whatsmore, not particularly well-written. Other than a few memorable quotes, ""...she was becoming herself and daily casting aside that fictitious self which we assume like a garment with which to appear before the world,"" and ""...life appeared to her like a grotesque pandemonium and humanity like worms stuggling blindly toward inevitable annihilation,"" the piece is quite staid. Awakenings, in general, should awaken others even vicariously-perhaps I am simply jaded?"
1,most boring book ever,The Awakening is the most boring book i have ever read. It Portrays the life of a spoiled and incompetent woman who cant even appreciate the lifestyle that she has. The only redeeming quality the book has is that she dies in the end of the book (i laughed hard when she swam out too far).
2,pretty useless,"The cajun setting thing was nice. Maybe if I was a woman I would feel empowered, angry, and/or moved by this. I don't know. And maybe it was much more powerful/original when it was first published. I don't know. But now I really don't care."
3,A women's battle with society in the 1800's.,To a woman in the nineties the actions of Mrs. Pontellier would not seem abnormal. But to the Creole society they were extremely unorthodox. We thought that this was a slow moving story with no excitment. In order to enjoy this book you would have to put yourself back into the mindset of a women in the 1800's.
4,Outstanding late 19th century novel.,"A brave piece of work written in the late 1800's. What makes this book outstanding is its theme and imagery. Chopin articulated very well a woman continue in the traditional gender role but at the same time develop a sense of who she is, i.e. outside of family, outside of husband, outside of children? Here, Edna could not and thus the story has a tragic ending (I should just say suicide since the ""utopianpessimist 4/28/99"" let the cat out of the bag already!!!). I agree with a previous reader that at first it seemed like a pathetic ending. On the other hand, one must look at the context of Edna's situation and the circumstances in her life. This book should be part of every woman's library"
3,Morally courageous; rhetorically--er--flaccid,While bold in its emancipatory theme--a theme I applaud--Chopin's novel left me groaning at times because of narrative strategies that seemed archaic or melodramatic to modern sensibilities. After reading The Awakening I immediately turned to a writer about whom I'm normally ambivalent: Hemingway. Had to cleanse the palate I'm afraid.
3,"A good book, but a confusing ending!!","I liked this book for the most part. I thought that the begining was a little bit slow but it picked up once you got into it. Another thing that i would like to comment about was the ending. I liked how it was left kind of open for people to interpret in their own way, but I thought that it was confusing. I would recommend this to other people but tell them to be ready to think."
3,love makes you go through alot!!!,"I liked the book The Awakening, by Kate Chopin. It showed how some women react when they can't find love or when they're not happy in the relationships that they are in. The book had many details in it regarding Edna's life and her different relationships. The book had a very ironic ending where she ended up drowning herself, that lets people know how some people value the company and love of other people and if they don't get that then they feel as if their life is over.I recommend this book to anyone who has the time to read it. It's very interesting and will make you turn emotional.I don't advise people who are in bad relationships to read the book fearing that they might make drastic turns as Edna did."
3,The Awakening...,"I had to write a report for honors english 11, so i bought this book.I had to compare Zora's ""Janie"" from Eyes are watching god, to Awakening's ""Edna""...It was an OK book, mainly because im a guy, and i dont normally get sapped into this kind of stuff.-------summarization of book:Woman gets tired of husband, seeks new men, finds love, or does she?-------"
2,A Short Slog with Uneven Characters,"This is not my favorite book. I get its importance to Western letters, but parts really drag (even though it is relatively short) and the character development is somewhat uneven."
1,Do not buy on CD,"I bought this book on CD--please don't make my mistake.It sounds as if it was taken from a well used taped version. Each CD starts out fine, but around the second chapter static begins. By the middle of each CD it becomes difficult to hear the words. By around the seventh or eighth chapter of each CD it becomes unintelligible. I was dissappointed to say the least. I may at a later date purchase the book so I can at least finish the story, but right now I'm just not interested."
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING,"This was by far THE WORST book I have ever been forced to read. I'm not one for required reading, but I have read some good books in my English classes, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" stands out as one of my favorites, but this book was utter torture!"
3,Decent book,The book isn't that great. It is a classic but I did not enjoy the plot behind it. It was quite obvious to guess the ending.
3,Feminism at Best,"Kate Chopin's ""The Awakening"" portray's strength and feminism at its greatest. The book shows the struggles of a woman trying to make it in a world set with standards. She finds it hard to grow and expand her happiness and destiny in life. After everything she puts her family through, she manages to think of the wellness of her soul and mind. She breaks off from her family, friends, and society enabling herself to feel completly free. Chopin challenges society's standards through an imprisoned woman in her own world. The struggles the character faces depicts strength and courage from influential people and standards. It shows a beautiful transition of servitude to tranquillity. ""The Awakening"", also, opened doors for feminsim and women's rights. It set a mental precedent into society's conscience. ""Awakening"" is one of the greatest works that inspires people to break away from imprisonment of society's principles."
5,Great Read,"Honestly when I 1st started reading this book, I really didn't want to read it. (I had choosen it off a list to read for school) However as I continued I was completely taken in by it. I highly recommend this book to anyone. Now I know why it is considered to be a classic."
1,Poorly written and very dated.,The story was interesting only as a piece of literary and cultural history.
1,Didn't love the book,"Got it for book club, didn't even end up finishing it - it was way too stuffy for my liking. I've never been a fan of considerably older works, however, and many of the other girls in my bookclub enjoyed it."
5,A story of passion,"The book was quite a shock at the time it was first published because it deals with women infidelity, which was a taboo subject at the time. I recommend it as an easy enjoyable read, especially for its subtle ironies."
2,Interesting premise- poorly written,"Obviously the premise of this novel is good, or else it would not be a classic. However, I believe that the same concept could have been better and more captivatingly written. In the books that I have read earlier this term for English (Light in August, Sun Also Rises, Scarlet Letter and Ethan Frome) you got lost in the characters and engulfed by the story. Yet in this book you always feel as if you are on the outside looking in and you never feel any comraderie with the characters and that makes it all the more difficult to feel Edna's plight and what drives her to the end that it does."
1,"An unbelievably whiny, obnoxious, and self-centered heroine","Although I am certain that some individuals would beg to differ, I found Chopin's The Awakening an exercise in masochism. I found the main character, Edna, did not elicit any sense of pity. The notion of societal pressures on an indivdual is certainly valid, but Chopin's dull (at least in my personal opnion)prose made the point too blatant, and Edna's so-called escape is a very poor resolution to such problems."
1,The WORST book ever!,"I have noticed that many say that females love this book and the females can relate to Edna and her feelings about love, marriage, and children. As a female, I wholeheartedly disagree. Edna is a spoiled and whiny character who after finally ""awakening"" takes an easy way out that should never even be considered. Though she is ""awakened"", she is ultimately a weak person and I hope that no female reads this book and ""awakens"" to be the type of person she is."
1,Rich 19thCentury Woman Abandons Family & Self,"Just because a woman doesn't like her position in a male-dominated, repressive society doesn't automatically make every way she rebels feminist. This character was pretty shallow and uncompelling, very much a spoiled brat. I can't believe it is hailed as some sort of early feminist landmark!"
5,A cutting edge novel for its time,"If you enjoy novels that address the social norms and conventions of a given time period, this is one you won't want to miss. I was first introduced to this book as a sophomore in college in my ""Women Writers of the 20th Century"" English class. Kate Chopin masterfully paints a picture of a woman desperately seeking more in her life; a woman who doesn't ""fit the mold"" of societal conventions at the turn of the 20th century. Chopin slowly builds Edna Pontellier bit by bit, painstakingly peeling away at the layers and the facades this woman has been taught to put on--and which her character throws off with fancy free and terrible heartache almost simultaneously. Edna is a flawed heroine, but perhaps that is why the reader becomes entranced with her. There is a little of Edna Pontellier in all of us--seeking the essence of life; seeking love and freedom."
1,Edna is totally selfish,"I really did NOT like the book. Edna really ticked me off. She is a total player. She sleeps with other guys, ignores her kids and sends them to their grandparents, ignores her sister's wedding, etc, etc, etc. Chopin must've been smoking some serious stuff when she wrote because it went totally against the values of the day, and Edna is looked upon as a totally selfish person who is only looking to benefit herself. This may be called feminism, but it is total crap for the fact that not all feminists are inconsiderate sluts. She portrays Leonce as being an inconsiderate person, but in fact he is more loving to her than she is to him. He gives her what she wants, does what she asks, but she does not do what he asks. She gives a wrong view of both men and women."
5,Incredible read,"Although Kate Chopin did not publish much in her lifetime, she made a strong impact. I especially loved Awaking. It hit a chord for several reasons. First, I was amazed to read something from 1899 with such a strong conviction toward women's rights, with such a realistic ending. Second, I think there are so many of us females today struggling with our own identities. I loved that the heroine broke from the norm and persued a life of her own (rather than living for her two children or the opinions of her husband). Third, I got a taste of an historical and diverse Louisiana. This is the story of Edna Pontellier and her journey toward self-awareness/discovery through one summer of freedom from her husband and children. I especially loved that she was flawed enough in the end to defy social/familial convention to commit the ulimate self-driven act."
3,interesting yet somewhat boring( Lewellyn's review),"The book wasn't at all what i expected it to be. I thought it was going to be more of a romantic book where the two couples were going to try to be together at any cost. But i was wrong. this book didn't really capture my attention. Only a portion of the book kept me awake and it was mostly in the middle. even though this book is not what i consider to be ""my book"", i would recommend that anyone should read it if they are interested in romantic drama."
3,"Not well done, but worth the read","The narrative style of this novel is quite astonishingly clumsy, and the novel's principal merits lie in what is portrayed, not the manner of portrayal. Chopin's characterization, symbolism, and themes are all a little too obvious to be effective. However, the imagery in the book is beautiful. The colours, especially, are very compelling, as are the tactile images-- when the heroine swims, the sea (which is a major and obvious symbol) ""enfolds"" her in an embrace which is almost sexual. All in all, a good read, although certainly not one of my favourite books."
3,Tale of a self-pitying housewife,"Ms. Chopin's language is lyrical and beautiful, but the story is rather weak. Why is it that we should feel so sorry for poor Mrs. Pentellier for having to keep up her beautiful house and take care of her children and conform to social roles, when Mr. Pentellier has his responsibilities too, and fulfills them, and is rewarded only by infidelity from his wife? And we are to applaud this?"
4,The Awakening,"In ""The Awakening"" by Kate Chopin, Edna lives in a society during the late eighteen hundreds and has her own role assigned to her by that society. Edna has a hard time sticking to her role, especially when she meets Robert; who becomes a good friend. Throughout the novel, Edna is attempting to find herself and who she really is, behind the role that society has placed on her.""The years that are gone seem like dreams-if one might go on sleeping and dreaming-but to wake up and find-oh! well! Perhaps it is better to wake up after all, even to suffer, rather than to remain a dupe to illusion all one's life.""This novel is a relatively short read and is slightly difficult. I really enjoyed the book and especially enjoyed the symbolism throughout; I would rate it a nine out of ten. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a proficient reader and enjoys novels that involve social issues."
2,hard to get into,This was just not my kind of book. I had to read it for my book club and I did not enjoy it. It was kind of boring. Perhaps when it was written this was a feminist book but today it is lame. Others in my club liked it.
1,textbook,"Needed to buy it foNeeded to buy it for a class, can't recommend it since it wasn't a purchase for fun, just out of necessity."
2,it was okay,"I didn't like the book because it showed how week Edna was and how she her lovers first in her life.The book was ironic to me because I didn't expect Edna to drown herself, especially over a male.I recommend this book to females who are interested in knowing how some women choose to handle their love life."
1,"Sure, literary merit but so boring!","This book surpasses even The Scarlett Letter in being dull! There is absolutely no action. The heroine is frustratingly naive and the ending is horribly disappointing! The premise of the novel has promise but the delivery lacks anything to involve the reader, leaving him bored and DYING for the end of this sub-par read."
3,I must admit..,"I must admit I found this book quite boring. I can't get past Kate Chopin's rather excessive writing style. I had to read this book for my American Literature class, so I am sure there is much merit to it, but ""zzzz"".It has an interesting idea overall though. The opression of women in the 1800s and how it destroyed some brilliant people; or maybe even kept them from becoming real people. While we were discussing this book in class, a classmate of mine said that Edna seemed to be copying the actions of those around her because she hadn't been able to develop her own personality. I think we all know how that is, sometimes. I think that idea would be interesting in a modern setting. Maybe a young person who grows up in the big city and is blank until he goes out into the country and finds his true passion for farming.This is probably an important book for those interested in feminism to study. I would like to study it but without all the lengthy prose."
4,THERE IS NO AWAKENING,"THE AWAKENING is well written and provides interesting insights into a woman undergoing a personality transformation. However, the title is misleading. There is no awakening, merely a woman emerging from one delusional perception of the world into another even detached from reality. All-in-all, a pessimistic book that is unlikely to inspire anyone going through a similar experience to rise above it.(Peter Payne, author of CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA BATTLES THE BEELZEBUBIAN BEASTS OF THE BIBLE)"
4,Joy of Life and Death,"""The Awakening"" by Kate Chopin is a great book. It deals with a woman who is confused about the way her life is going. She doesn't realize it but she is an extremely strong woman. She has to deal with the feelings she has for her husband and children and also for another man. She doesn't want to be tied down. She loves her family and regrets that she cannot give herself completely. A part of her awakening comes when she decides to swim in the ocean by herself. She has the feeling of pure joy and a certain amount of sensual pleasure as she swims farther and farther into the ocean. She begins to wonder why she had never done this before because it is a pleausre that is so enjoyable. In the end she gives herself back to the ocean. She returns to a place where she feels an unexplained joy of life and death."
4,A Riveting Tale!,"After reading The Awakening, a story of a woman breaking free from typical society, we concluded that the themes portrayed in this novel will continue to perpetuate themselves throughout time. Therefore, we recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading 19th century literature. In life, everyone lives through their own periods of ""awakenings"", and reading Chopin's novel can help to better understand them. What a riveting tale filled with both romance and suspense!"
5,"oh, you all didn't read it well enough!!!!!","this book is great. it holds so much knowledge to be learned, especially when read by a women! men may misunderstand it, but that's to be expected. if a woman dislikes this book, there must be something hanging over her head, telling her that it's not good to free yourself from what the town, state, country, culture, and world expect from a woman. edna does what's right for her, and no one understands her. sadly, this book will be relevant to the us for many years to come, but perhaps that time can be shortened if more people would read this book and undersatnd it for what it is! beauty!"
5,WHAT AN AMAZING WOMAN!,"I WAS FIRST INTRODUCED TO THIS BOOK AS A YOUNG CHILD. JONI HAS TRULY BEEN AN INSPIRATION TO ME. I AM NOW A 22 YEAR OLD WOMAN WHO HAS LIVED WITH CEREBRAL PALSY SINCE BIRTH. LIKE JONI, I TOO AM A BORN AGAIN CHRISTIAN AND I TRULY CANNOT IMAGINE (MY) LIFE WITHOUT THE LORD JESUS CHRIST IN IT. IN THIS MEMOIR, ONE TRULY SEES THE STRUGGLES, THE HEARTBREAKS, AND THE JOYS AND TRIUMPHS THAT THE LORD BRINGS THIS YOUNG LADY THROUGH. THIS IS A MUST READ FOR ANYONE-IN A CHAIR OR NOT, AND I TOO CAN SAY THAT I WOULD MUCH RATHER BE IN A CHAIR WITH THE LORD, THAN ON MY FEET WITHOUT HIM."
3,Children's book biography,"I bought this book for a friend who is now paralyzed from a pedestrian hit and run accident. Didn't realize it was an ""easy to read"" pre-teen appropriate book but she will enjoy reading it anyway and hopefuly be insprired to not give in to her depression.Also bought a book written by Joni that was wonderful about suffering and the sovereignty of God."
4,Introspective and enlightening.,"At 17, Joni (pronounced ""Johnny"") Earekson prays that God will turn her life around. The answer to her prayer took the form of a diving accident that left her paralyzed from the neck down. Non-Christians may find Joni's spiritual reflections tiresome or puzzling, but will still find inspiration in a young girl's transformation from suicidal despair to spiritual serenity. Illustrated with photos and reproductions of some of Joni's artwork, this is a worthwhile read, best suited for a summer day under a shade tree or a winter night beside a warm fire."
5,Uplifting,I bought this book for a handicapped girl in my Sunday school class. Her family is supportive of her but this was a boost she needed. She was taken with the courage and happiness of Joni.
4,Cannot Imagine What It Might Be LIke If..,She really brought home what her first reactions and experiences were as she described what she was feeleing (or not feeling) when she hit the bottom on that fateful dive into the water. From a less spritual belief to one that saved her day! I have since seen her on televsion and she is amazing. A great read for those who struggle with lessor issues.
4,love it,This is the perfect lampshade. It goes with the whole nursery theme. It fits on any lamp. You don't have to get the teddy bear lamp base.
1,Was shipped a car shade instead of the lamp shade,Still waiting to receive the correct products I ordered! Im sure I will love it because my nursery will be finished once I finally receive the lampshade I ordered.
1,This is a bad joke!,"This is absolutely a joke.Every thing on this disc is synthesized and it sounds like computer games from the 70's.If you are a classical music listener, stay away from this product.I am not just disappointed, I am angry!I want my money back!"
1,Not worth the stomach pain,"I picked this up at the grocery store thinking, oh this will make for a quick and cheap meal. That is was. As I ate it, I thought to myself this is pretty tasty considering it came right from the box. As the night went on, my stomach started to get very upset. It made me feel absolutely miserable. Stomach in knots, cramping, bloating, gas, diahrrea...you know, the works. Consider this a fair warning for anyone considering trying this product."
3,Little dissatisfied,"These are very good quality on construction and look. Love the metal - many times get plastic which breaks. However, have trouble sometimes with socket making connection. The socket material is very solid. I am not sure it is the lights. I find with bulbs these days - probably coming from other countries don't always make secure connections. It seems like the threads do line up or the bulb base may not be quite long enough. I have purchased many lights from House of Troy and they are really good quality. I have not contacted the company but I am sure their customer service would exchange but like I said it maybe the bulbs that are now made out of states"
2,Surprised at poor quality offered by Simmons product,"I received several of the Simmons covers to go along with the Simmons contour changing pad and have been very disappointed with the quality. All shrank after the first wash and seemed to have become smaller with each washing. This causes the corners of the pad to get pulled up when I put a new cover on it . The fabric is also harsher than others. I eventually purchased the Babies R Us brand of covers and found them to be excellent - extremely soft, durable, and correct fit even after multiple washings."
3,Great covers but they shrink!,"I have two of the Simmons covers and one of the Circo covers (from Target). The Simmons held up okay in the wash (no fraying) but really shrank. I washed and dried according to the directions but both are now really small - bending up the corners of my contoured changing pad. My Circo cover frayed and started to pull away from the elastic after one wash.I use these and throw a lap pad down where the baby's bottom is so I can just throw the lap pad in the wash, if there is an accidental diaper mishap while changing. I throw the cover in the wash every 3 days or so.Would be great if it did shrink so much after one wash."
3,Okay Cover,"The cover really is a nice way to make a changing pad look better in a room and it is softer on baby, but it can be a pain. I had been washing it in cold water and hanging it to dry to prevent shrinking, but I accidently put in the dryer once and it is hard to get on the pad now. The corners of the pad pull up now when the cover is on it. I have washed mine approximately 10 times or so and it already has strings coming out of it. The cover does make it nice when baby pees while changing her on the cover. If there is no cover the pee runs everywhere on the smooth pad, but with the cover it soaks it up and prevents it from running everywhere. I wish it were a little more durable, but overall - I am glad I have a cover."
2,"Soft, but....","Where are the changing table sheets that fit changing table pads?This one is very soft, but the sides of my changing table pad pucker up because it is not long enough. I have a standard size changing table and I didn't have a problem 9 years ago finding sheets for a similar changing table pad I had. I gave it 2 stars because it is so soft and plush, but it just doesn't fit right."
2,not very durable,"So, I pre-washed the cover, then washed it after it got dirty. It already started coming unraveled at the elastic border. Did I just end up with a lemon, or are they all made this poorly?"
1,Horrible Quality,"I bought one of these washed it and a huge hole appeared. The next day I exchanged it for another in a different color, washed it and again it frayed and had holes. They are terrible quality and will never last, unless maybe you want to handwash it and not dry it in a dryer."
5,Looks pretty in her room...,"I bought this changing pad cover to fit my Simmons contoured changing pad. We have had this cover (I have 2 of them, actually) for a full year now, and we have not experienced any problems with it at all. It shrinks a little in the dryer, but once you get it back on the changing pad, it stretches right back out to the right size and looks just fine. Bibs with velcro do stick to it, but they stick to socks and everything else, too, and I do not feel that this is a defect of the changing pad cover. These things just happen! (You can avoid this by washing bibs separately.) This cover looks nice in my daughter's room, I have the pink one and the sage one, and they go well with her bedding. We were satisfied with this product."
2,only okay...,"My wedding ring catches on the fabric almost every diaper change causing the terry cloth to snag and leaving me frustrated! Also, it shrunk quite a bit and fits really tightly, so putting it on takes some muscle."
1,Don't buy it!,"The cover does not come pre shrunk. So, it did fit the changing pad the first time I put it on. However, after the first wash, putting it on the table pad was the biggest joke. I would say it shrank by the size it needed to be. We purchased two, in white and pink, and they both turned out the same. I am very disappointed. The price I paid was too much for such poor quality. Almost $13.00 and they did not last one wash. The material did not maintain its original texture or nap."
3,it's okay,"I've used 2 blue covers for the last 16 months washing and drying. They definitely tightened up on the first wash compared to out of the package but haven't gotten much worse. I tried hanging to dry but it was the same and the terry wasn't as soft with air drying either. They are always tight going on and cause the corners of the whole pad to bend up but after 1 change or so they seem to stretch out and the pad lies flat again. Once my son's diapers got bigger and messier at around 1 year old it seems fruitless to put it on because they get soiled right away so I have resorted to only using it when guests come to ""pretty up"" the room and that way I can sanitize the pad. But I will probably buy them again for the new baby in girl colors since it is too cold for clothes changes without it and I haven't seen any better options out there."
2,Good as a back-up,This changing pad cover doesn't wash that well. The frabric starts to fray and shrinks which causes the changing pad to bow up on the sides. I would recommend an Ultra Plush Velboa changing pad cover. It washes well and doesn't shrink. It also always looks new; soft and fluffy.
4,Jaw Dropper Canon i450,"The awsome of this Printer its offers a extremely SHARP and Detail Image of pictures, compare with the Epson C series I think the Canon offer a much better rich and vivid color than the other competitor of his class. But nobody can bit this price.I only have one problem: The Color Ink Cartridge is more expensive than the Epson C series price is range from $5.00 to $6.00 more.Also The other concern that I have with this particular i450 Canon printer its only use two cartridges of ink combine a total of four color, one black and one with three color, well I don't know may be I am very selective and I like more quality of printing.And also the printer itself when its not operating and stay idle for a period of time the printer start make wired noise sound like a going to print something.A must have on this printer ""USB Cable, don't forget"" doesn't come with it.But overall I think it is a Good Value printer to get."
3,FAR FROM PERFECT,"The output quality is okay but: 1) the printing is very slow; 2) the black ink (original Canon) smudges more than any inkjet I've had before; 3) once you start printing there's no easy way to stop (like if you forgot to specify the number of pages on a very long document - happens to me all the time!); 4) The manual has the WRONG INSTRUCTIONS for Macintosh computers and 5) I'm having a lot of trouble getting replacement ink cartridges (they call them ""tanks"" though they're the size of your little finger!) - at this moment it seems every store in town (Montreal) is out of black ink."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON AS THEY WILL SCREW YOU,"donot buy at amazon and donot beleave anything they tell you as they will lie to you as they did to me , donot buy from sellers on amazon any amazon.com do not trust them"
2,Lifetime: 1 Year,"I really liked this printer while it lasted. It printed color beautifully, though I never did get a chance to test its photo printouts. I print occasionally. Maybe 10-20 pages/week. Unfortunately, after a year, the print head broke on its own. If they had a longer lasting printer similar to this, I would definitely get it."
1,Buy an Epson,"Bought mine in Nov.'04 - worked great until the print head went out in April'05. Now it's August only 4 months later and the print head as once again gone kaput. $80 bucks in 4 months, what a piece of crap. I do not recommend this printer to anyone, in fact I wish I had bought another Epson! Anyone with a limited income should steer clear of this shoddy printer."
3,Just one caveat,"I'm not going to write a full review because I've mostly used the printer for greyscale illustrator work and although I have no complaints I have no basis for praise.I would like to say one thing though:This printer eats ink faster (...). Not only is the consumption rapid, but the exchange frequency is higher. The ink cartridges are tiny, so you'll be replacing them often. If an HP Deskjet Cartridge lasts you a month, one of these will last a week. I went through two in one print job of 20 pages."
2,Dead after less than a year,"This was a great printer...Crisp clear graphics and text. But it just recently started printing ""foggy"" lots of fuzzy text. Then the black stopped printing altogether. The color printed fine but NO BLACK. Not exactly helpful for printing papers. Canon help desk was very quick getting back to me about the problem. Probably a bad print head, but it should be taken to a fixit shop to get checked out. Fixit shop wants $75 just to look at it, which is applied to the first hour of labor if we have it fixed. Print head runs about $45. I can buy a whole new one for that! I would by a Canon again but definately get the extended warranty.Buy the comparable ink from Carrot Ink.com. Cost alot less. Refilling doesn't not work with Canon. This was my 2nd Canon and refilling the cartridges didn't work with either."
3,Great print quality,"The print quality is outstanding. However, the noise is a bit more than annoying. I read the reviews about the noise and thought, a little squeaking could not be that bad. Well, it is this fingernails-on-the-chalkboard kind of sound that goes about thirty seconds longer than you think you can stand it. I recommend you go another way ..... Unless you're deaf."
2,Traditional Regency,"Some Paula Marshall's I enjoy, but not this one. I found the hero a little too arrogant and condescending for my personal tastes.From the back cover of the Mills&Boon paperback....DECEPTION AND DESIRE...The Earl of Devenish reluctantly returned to his ancestral home, Tresham Hall in Surrey. A cynical man, often deserving his nickname Devil, he didn't expect to be so powerfully drawn to his neighbour, Mrs Drusilla Faulkner. Quiet and demure in public, in private she showed a wit, and strength of will, to match his own. But her husband's untimely death was part of the puzzle he was investigating, and he couldn't be sure that she wasn't involved..."
2,High Performance Isapi/Nsapi Web Programming,"Decent coverage of ISAPI, but far too many code examples had errors in them that prevented them from compiling. Errors were corrected on the CD."
1,wouldn't recommend to adv. readers,the authers provide only standard examples from Microsoft and Netscape. The book is not organized as a reference. Authors failed to respond to a question regarding a specific topic.
5,The Best by far,"I first bought this album, on vinyl, in October 1986. I had been eagerly anticipating ""Scoundrel days"" ever since I had worn out ""Hunting High and Low"". I've read most of the reviews and they all seemed to have overlooked the track ""October"". This to me is one of the most heart-wrenching songs ever written about lonliness. Overall I have to say that this is a true musical masterpiece. There was something magic and unique about A-ha at this time, it was probably their freshness, their musical and vocal abilities. Morten's soaring vocals and Pal's creative music and lyric writing combined with awesome production make this album a must have if you truly want to complete your collection. Now I have had this album on CD for many years and it has kept all it's magic. By the way I am not a 12 year old as the title suggests, I am a 34 year old Male from southern Ireland."
4,Not as focused as the first collection....,"But still this has some great songs and is a highlight fromthe 1980's. I found ""Hunting High and Low"" more uniform butI do feel ""Scoundrel Days"" shows Aha taking more chances, much growth as a group, and Mortens incredible vocal range has no rivals. I agreewith a reviewer it was a sound in transition and not everything flowed together quite as well as the first one, but there is a quality here that transends the pop sheen and the media imageAha had taken on and it needed repeated listens to really feelthis music. Like the firstcollection I play this one quite a bid and it could use a remastering to bring out the little things from this highlyunderated group."
3,More control,"More artistic control over the shaping of this album is evident with the title track ""Scoundrel Days"" being a hint of the toll of their new found fame with previous album ""Hunting High & Low"". The boys had a lot of fun making this album demonstrated in the tracks ""I've Been Losing You"" and ""The Swing Of Things"" which contain the rawness their first album lacked. Last, but not least ""Manhattan Skyline"" is just a beautiful ballad, my personal favorite off the album. Unfortunately, a-ha will always be plagued by the success of ""Take On Me"", don't get me wrong, I love that song but they have made so much better. To hear a-ha at their best check out the album ""East Of The Sun & West Of The Moon""."
3,Scoundrel Days - disappointing 2nd album,"Hunting High And Low was full of pop gems, ranging from ""Take On Me"" to ""Love Is Reason"" and many others. It had a surprisingly addictive quality to it.Scoundrel Days, on the other hand, delves into somewhat darker territory, but many of the songs are merely filler. Cry Wolf and The Soft Rains Of April are the only stand-out tracks on the album, and even Cry Wolf is inferior to The Soft Rains of April.Stay On These Roads is their best effort yet (full of intoxicatingly atmospheric and addictive works of art), despite the hauntingly addictive ""I Call Your Name"" on the East of the Sun / West of the Moon CD.I eagerly await their new CD, Minor Earth/Major Sky. It's been a long time coming, though I'm sure today's rap/grunge/rock filled scene won't permit any hit singles from the CD in the US. That's a pity given A-Ha's generally fantastic songwriting ability."
5,The feeling this music creates stays with you all day...,"These guys know the potent relationship between music and the soul. Scoundrel Days creates a ""thoughtful"" headspace that stills your heart, makes your spirit breathe, sends you elsewhere and slows down time. The ""tones"" in which this band forms seems to soothe, inspire, and hits deep to the core of your soul. I think everyone who has a serious appreciation about the beauty of music should listen to A-ha. Your going to experience an awesome emotional energy that is irreplaceable to your heart. Buy their works, then you'll know what I mean. ""Stay On These Roads"" guys! Your music is needed. You're the best band that could ever be."
4,Good follow-up CD,Maybe Maybe was one of my favorites off this CD. I thought it was a good follow-up album to Hunting High and Low.
5,Very Passionate.............,"I finally got this album and boy am I glad. The titled song, ""Scoundrel Days"" left me breathless when I first heard it. The entire album is a hit and has passion and feelings that run through it. Morten Harket is just fantastic. No one has the voice and passion that this man has to offer. Its a must have for all A-HA and new-wave fans. It is A-HA's most passionate album to date."
4,"Hard to find fault here, great album","This is a masterpiece in pop. It scores high in almost every category, in this order: Melody, Production Values, Intangibles, Lyrics, and Musicianship. Only reason why the latter was lower, and only slightly, was the lack of guitar and a little too much electronica, which was typical of the day. There's really no bad songs on this album, a couple scored slightly lower than others, like 'Cry Wolf', and 'We're Looking For The Whales' mainly because of the average musicianship and thin sound comparatively speaking. 'I've Been Losing You' and 'The Swing Of Things' were then and still are 2 of a-ha's absolute best, the former scoring a perfect 5 out of 5. This and 'East Of The Sun...' are my 2 favorite a-ha albums, should be interesting to see how 'East..' does in my scoring, gonna be close. 'Scoundrel Days' rates 4.3 out of 5."
5,"underappreciated, wholesome Scandipop","Of all of a-Ha's albums, this has to be the most accomplished. No, the lyrics don't make much by sense, but after the playfulness of Hunting High and Low, this album is much tougher and musically more interesting. I'm not sure why I still listen to it over and over again 12 years after it's release, but it is definitely one of my faves. Best songs: 'The Swing of Things' and 'Cry Wolf'"
2,RFCs are more enjoyable.,"Everything is fine with its content. I just don't like its style. RFCs are more enjoyable to read than this book. The writer says that this chapter will give you something but you have to find it, no bullets, no balds, no italics, just a plain text. To sum up, I don't find it readable.Again I don't say anything about its content. This book gives you idea (nothing more) about Location Services for Wireless Web, but you should be ready to read 400 page plain text. Some may like this kind of books. If you want to enjoy while reading please think twice before buying."
5,one of the best purchase I've ever made,"In fact, I've got the printer (...) when it was in promotion. Cheap, but never seen any inkjet printer good as this one. I'm 100% satisfied with the picture quality. Simply the best value for the money."
2,boring,"Glori-Anne Gilbert is the only good thing in this movie, because of her beautiful appearance. But all in all Blood Sisters: Vamps 2, is a dull boring skin flick, with over the top performances."
2,I'm In This Movie!,"Wow, I thought this project had been shelved. It was filmed ages ago and I never heard of any kind of release or anything. Glad to see it finally made it out, even though it was a few years ago.I was an extra in the strip club scenes, but I have no idea how much you see me, if at all. A key point you might see me in is when one of the strippers kills some dude on stage and all the guys in the club scramble for the doors. I had the brilliant idea of slamming some guy to the ground to get him out of my way, making me the second to last guy out. Not sure if that bit made the cut, but if it did, that's me.I gotta say, I distinctly remember the filming was a bit on the, shall we say, ""lower than low budget"" side, and the acting, well, I'm not sure we can really call it that. It was fun, though.Just ordered it for about $3 bucks. Can't wait to see if I made it in."
3,Get it for Carl,"Although the artist isn't noted in the track listing on this page, ""BLUE SUEDE SHOES"" is by Carl Perkins backed by the Stray Cats(!) or at least Lee and Slim Jim. This version is killer - if you're a rockabilly fan of any degree this low album price is worth it for this little known recording.I'm a big Dave Edmunds fan - but the stuff on here is in his lame-o mid-80's vein, post DE7th."
4,A real winner!,Most books on trading show us how to MAKE successful trades. McMaster shows us how to BECOME successful traders.
3,Good advice,"A lot of basic concepts, cut your losses, be disciplined etc. Author compares traders to gamblers in chap. 1. Personnally I dont think both can be compared.Author recommands to trade via a broker over the phone (book written in 1999) where I strongly disagree. We're in the computers and internet era. Not in the wheel era. Trading via a stockbroker is obsolete and is a waste of time in the year 2000.Excellent book for the average trader, overall. Chap. 7 and 8 worth the price of the book. A great concept that needs to be read about the trader's inner ressources. The rest is known usual stuff.The conclusion of the book should be re-written. Author missed it totally.Overall, a fair book."
5,5 stars...,excellent product and very useful .. 100% recommended for those looking for a good product and the best is the good price
5,I could not put the book down.,"This was a wonderful book that guided me back to get in touch with God and the importance of his presence in our lives. The author made Jesus real to me. It did not covert me nor reafirm my religious affiliation but it certainly renewed my faith in the goodness in all of us. It did this without preaching, without adding guilt. It just left me with a belief that I, along with each person on earth, have an important role to play, even if only in the eyes of God. Read it and belive again. I purchased several copies of this book and have shared it with my best friends and others who need a new sense of direction in their lives."
5,The Josua Series is an Inspiration for Better Livin,The Joshua series is a blessing. Reading it helped me realize true peace. I highly recommend it to anyone that is seeking spiritual guidance.
4,Story tells the possibility.,"Few stories relay the message of the beauty of living a simple, giving life. The author's writing style allows for an easy read."
5,This book speaks to your soul.,The Joshua series is very inspirational. I can't think of a better gift for a loved one. It is compelling with its simplicity. I don't remember ever reading a novel that left me feeling so peaceful and full of hope.
1,Misleading,"Guaranteed not to leak? Yeah, that's why I fall asleep and a matress full of air and wake up on the ground with this huge plastic sheet that was once a Coleman matress."
5,Amazing work!,"The first record album I bought was Loretta Lynn's Greatest Hits when I was five years old. I have adored this woman's music all of my life. This is without question her best and most innovative album of her career. Jack White has produced her with obvious love and respect, and it shows. Come Grammy Award time, I am certain that Mrs. Lynn will be getting a trophy...at least one if not several. This album is an original, and it's true. She's not a country singing pop wannabe (are you reading, Shania?)--Loretta Lynn is the real deal. Congratulations, Mrs. Lynn...Doolittle must be very proud!"
5,INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was blown away!! Loretta is pushing 70, but you sure wouldn't know it by the sound of this album. At times, it really rocks!! ""Miss Leroy Brown"" is my favorite cut, but all the songs are pretty good and they were all written by Loretta herself. Jack White has done an outstanding job of showcaseing this country icon and if people who don't like country music will just sample the album, I'm sure she'll win some new fans. This album certainly proves that Loretta Lynn is STILL a force to be reckoned with. All Loretta Lynn fans should definately add this album to their collections. I am truly impressed."
4,Long time Loretta fans. Be warned!,"I bought this album with little knowledge about Jack White of White Stripes. I am 28 years old and have been a fan of Loretta Lynn since I fell in love with the Coal Miner's Daughter movie years ago. Let all long time Loretta fans know that this is not your Grandma's country music. I was even taken back by the edgier sound of the music in contrast to Loretta's voice we love so much. However, I like it because Loretta really belts out on this album and the songs are with lyrics and melodies that I would compare to her older songs. I recommend it if you're willing to embrace a little rock n' roll with Loretta!"
5,White is to Lynn as Rubin is to Cash,"This album accomplishes much the same thing the American Recordings did for Johnny Cash in 1994: it introduces a brilliant artist to a generation for whom the legend has eclipsed the meaning of the work which produced it. I knew her story, but now I finally understand why she is so beloved. Her lyrics are raw and tender, beautiful and hard. It is wonderful to discover an artist of this brillance and to know there is a huge body of work for me to explore."
5,"What a ""marriage""!","Loretta Lynn and Jack White,whoa!This album is superb,really country, but with a rock edge,thanks to the band ,made up of fine musicians from Jack's neck of the woods.It is so well recorded,Loretta sings like a dream.If you like music at all,you need to buy this record ,it will be one of the album of the year.Thanks to everyone involved in making it."
1,"Bad Writing, Bad Production, Bad Band","This is little more than a White Stripes record with Loretta Lynn singing. the playing is that of a garage band with no talent. If she wanted authenticity, she should have got musicians who actually knew how to play. the drums are weak, yet mixed way too high in the recordings, the lap guitar is feeble, the vocals are bizzare. Avoid this record if you love Loretta. If you love bad garage music, by all means pick this up immediately!!! I am desperately sorry I wasted my hard earned money on this crap."
1,the worst loretta cd ever!!!,"I DONT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH LORETTA'S HEAD WHEN SHE MADE THIS CD,THIS IS THE WORST IVE EVER HEARD HER SOUND!!! MY WIFE AND I WENT OUT THE DAY THIS CAME OUT, BECAUSE WE LOVE LORETTA WE BOUGHT THE CD!!!! PLEASE LORETTA STICK TO THE ORGINALS!!!"
2,Tin parts rock-a-twang?,"I don't know the work of the producer. I have always been an avid country, blues and gospel fan. Loretta still sounds great considering her age, however, most of the sample tracks provided for us to listen to sounded tinny. Some of it came close to what I consider heavy metal. Naw, TINNY is the word. There is too much hollow echoing sound. On one of the tracks she was talking and the tinny echoing prevented me from hearing what she was saying. I'd have to hear much more of the overall sound before I'd be willing to buy it."
1,"um, yeah, crap.","God, I have to listen to this horrible thing almost everyday at work. If she says have mercy one more time, I'm going to lose it. This is good music? What's everyone smoking. It's no more than muzak. Reinforced stereotypes of an already cliche genre. I've heard every riff a thousand times, every lyric a hundred more. Oh I know lets throw one of those hip new musicians into the mix that all the kids are talking about. Everytime I hear the name Jack White I want to vomit. Meg couldn't play drums to save her life, and to think I used laugh at them when they played little venues that at the most garnered five people. Just goes to show you that pop culture is a wasteland, and the public still has no taste."
1,"Give it up, Please.","This CD stinks. Loretta is too old to keep doing this. The tracks sound tired. I wouldn't recommend buying this album. Only Patsy Cline could pull off singing at such an age. Sorry to say, Loretta cant"
5,The best of both worlds classic Loretta with an updated feel,This CD is one of the best CDs I've bought in a loooooong time. Every single song is incredible. Loretta's gorgeous voice with Jack's backup brings an edgy grace to this great compilation. You'll be singin' along with every tune!
4,Van Lear Rose,"It was good to here Loretta writing music again. On the whole I liked the ablum. There was only one song that I was not partial too, it was Portland Oregon. But I did enjoy the rest of the music very much."
5,Beautiful and Riveting,"Loretta Lynn shines like never before. This album is nothing short of a masterpiece. EVERY song is beautifully written and beautifully sung. By far her best album EVER! I have only had this CD for one day, but have listened to it non-stop. The musical arrangements are amazing. Superb album!!!"
4,Something Different,"I bought this CD because I'm a big White Stripes fan. It's pretty cool. I've never really listend to Country music before, it's something different and new than what I'm used to. I like this CD, it's very good. Especially Loretta and Jack's duet. After listening to this I'm definately more open minded about checking out new styles of music."
5,Long Live the Queen!,"I was leary when I first bought this CD, because many times when something is universally praised it ends up being a disappointment. But when I heard the first few bars all my fears were put to rest. This music has such a great rock edge without losing the country sound. It takes Loretta in a new direction without making her sound foolish. I loved 'Portland, Oregon' and 'Story of My Life.' And 'Little Red Shoes' is a tremendous story. Very, very good."
5,Country fusion with a little snarl,"WOW! This album transcends all expectations I heard about it. The album sounds like it was recorded in an old kentucky coal mine, dirty and gritty, country roots at its finest. ""Portland Oregon"" is a fine example of the hard country fusion Jack has melted with the traveled voice of Loretta. They go back and forth about a crazy night in Portland with a pitcher of slow gin fizz. Another awesome track is Have mercy which sounds like Jack, Meg, and Loretta. This album will win many awards, mark my words!"
5,Great Album,"I have a few of Loretta Lynn's old songs via a compilation album I purchased and really like her voice and songs. I needed some music for a long plane flight so I decided to go ahead and try out this album. I have to say that I really like all the songs on Van Lear Rose. I keep catching myself humming the title track around the house. The songs and lyrics are well written, it's definitely a Loretta Lynn album, yet the sound is something different and new - it still has the country roots but there is a joyful rocking blues sound in this as well. I would recommend getting this Loretta Lynn album."
4,Nice effort from Loretta,"I bought this cd and was very pleased. The songs are very wellwritten and Loretta voice is as good as ever. The only complaintI have is that sometimes the music seems too loud and overcomesher beautiful voice. However, this is only true on a few numbers. The cd is well worth buying for the outstanking cuts: Family Tree, Miss Being Mrs., and Trouble On The Line. Enjoy!"
5,Lorettas best,This has got to be the best that Loretta has ever sounded..After all these years she just keeps getting better and better
3,"Good, but not great","I was hoping for a recording that would rival Johnny Cash's American Recordings and would make Loretta Lynn endure as another great artist whose work only got stronger as she aged. This is not it. Overall, I think the songwriting is weak. Loretta's voice is still really pleasing, but she lacks the conviction in her singing to really stir and move me. Still, it's an interesting collaboration and has some memorable moments. I think the most successful cut is Have Mercy."
1,Extemely Disappointed,"This cd was an extreme disappointment to me. I got through over half the cd and couldn't bear to listen any longer. The album cover was beautiful and led me to believe that I was going to hear some new, traditional country sounding Loretta Lynn music. The lyrics were ok, but the music was strange and even sometimes disturbing. If you miss the old style country music from the 50s and 60s don't buy this album."
1,Oof! What a disaster of a CD!,"I can't remember the last time I was this annoyed with a recording. If you love Loretta, aviod this recording. It is jsut plain junk!"
1,Not Loretta's best work.,"There are a couple of good songs in this collection, but this isn't Loretta's best work. In my opinion,it's her worst. The CD sounds like it's a practice session. The band does not sound professional."
2,Disappointed,"I was so disappointed in this CD. It was more rock than country. The music was dissonant, loud, and got on my nerves. I really like Loretta Lynn, but this is definately not one of her better efforts."
5,Jose Luis Rojas from Barquisimeto Venezuela I love this DVD,I really love this DvD because every thing in this dvd is great ann is what everybody is looking for. The scenes are beautyfull and the trama ia amazing.I am sure you are going to buy a great film for you and your family! the best thing ever made!
2,"Cute, but fictitious, dumbed down and disjointed","I was really disappointed in this. It was dumbed down and disjointed and quite frankly, it wasn't exactly accurate to the gospels. It was more of a ""what if"" from a fictitious perspective which makes it fiction, not a tool for evangelism like they claim. It was cute, but something just really bugs me about the scriptures not being portrayed accurately. Furthermore, it was boring to me, and I think that anything but a first grader would be bored too. But Jesus is NOT boring, so it must be the movie ;) Additionally, the actor sounded like Ringo Starr which was distracting to me, but he was a terrific actor in this film despite the the distracting accent."
3,video for older kids,"I bought this video to use in a third grade CCD class that I teach. When I previewed it, I was impressed with the effort that was put into the production of the film. But I did not show it to my class because some of the movie was too graphic for their age group. Also, some of the language would've been difficult for them to understand. I would recommend this video for the upper grades 5-6. The children narrating the movie are about that age. I wouldn't recommend it to use with younger children."
5,Yo Gabba Gabba Halloween DvD,My son is a Yo Gabba Gabba junkie and loves this DvD. It also saves us space on the DVR. Great product.
1,"Excellent introduction, poor kindle edition","This was the first chess book I had read (well over 35 years ago). When I browse through it I still see wonderful insights, things I could not understand then. Capablanca is one of the greatest players of the game, his writing is a good match to his play. You should be warned that this is not a very easy book, but it definitely repays study. I was delighted to see it as a kindle book.Unfortunately the kindle edition has no diagrams, which makes it totally useless. Besides the use of the outdated English notation in the text is difficult to follow."
5,Indispensable for Dutch Oven Cooking,"This table is a must if you want to try your hand at dutch oven cooking. We camped for two weeks, and the dutch oven meals were a huge hit! Without the table, though, it would have been cumbersome (on a fire, a grill, or on the ground). We put the D.O. table next to our picnic table or lounge chairs and were able to cook while being completely relaxed. Really fun."
3,"OK, but not worth $200","This is not a $200 table. The quality is only mediocre. Since the Lodge Dutch Ovens are so great, it was a disappointment. It is probably sturdy and stable enough to do the job, but I don't feel confident about it's durability. I'd recommend looking at one in a store before any purchase. Sloppy assembly."
5,Lodge A5-7Camp Dutch Oven Table,We found the product to be eveything we expected. It works wonderfully. Would buy again.
1,Poor quality control by Lodge,"This item arrived quickly from the seller. I have no problems with Amazon or the seller.The item arrived and I decided to assemble it before I took it on a campout. The wind shield that attaches to the cooking table was assembled incorrectly and it could not be attached to the table. Also one of the adjustable leg leveler screws in was stripped and could not be adjusted. I returned the product to Lodge.I received a replacement this past week, after not having it for two campouts, and upon taking it out of the box there were several bolts and nuts that fell out of the plastic wrapping. Only one of the legs was properly attached to the table. I was able to attach two of the other legs with the pieces that fell out of the packaging. I am still short 1 bolt to attach the 4th leg to the table. I am contacting Lodge again about the missing bolt."
4,Details on Kismet,"The book is well structured, and includes many photos and diagrams. I found it useful because I work exactly on the same topic. However, most of its content can be found elsewhere (in published articles). The accompanying CD-ROM includes very interesting videos, although I think they can also be found elsewhere. In summay, I definitely recommend this book, but only if you are really interested in the topic and/or in Kismet, and you want to know as many details as you can."
5,brilliant!,"Just as a diamond's facets make it shine, At the Bottom of the River is composed of disparate glimpses of brilliance. Short short stories in a unifying vein of carribean color, these pieces are mystical, sensual and poetic. The cadence of Kincaid's language takes hold of you-- you don't read this book so much as you surf it. . . you breathe it. . . you feel it resonate within you long after it's over."
1,"At the bottom of the River, a review by Dylan","At the Bottom of the river isn't, in my perspective, a very good book. I gave it one star. I gave it one star because there isn't really a plot, main character (at least with a name), and it is boring. The book is sort of written in a mix between the first person and third person perspectives. The book is hard to understand, especially with 2 two page long sentences! The book kind of seems like it is someone thinking, with no real reason. It skips from one place to another in one chapter. It is hard to get into the story, and since there is no plot, there is little suspense. All in all, it isn't a very good book, and I don't recommend it."
4,Good novel about a little known part of history,Belongs in the historical romance category but keeps it's history honest. I give the author an A for adding an afterward that explains deviations from fact and provides an outline of the broader historical picture. I found it readable and am glad I bought it.
5,A most poignant depiction of a single mother.,"This account of a woman struggling to find love and livlihood while in the throes of single motherhood is one of the most honest and moving portraits I've ever read. Mary Morris' talent in evoking both the absence of mother in the character, Ivy, as well as newly found rewards and challenges in her own new motherhood provides a story of both loss and redemption."
1,Don't buy,Junk I order 6 pen and only 1 out of 6 just work. This product I wouldn't advise for know 1 to buy
1,JUNK DONT BUY SUCKEY,I was really excited and when it got to my house I opened the package and I clicked the button and it didn't work. I opened the pen and I saw the batteries had the acid all over them and it didn't even work. PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,AWESOME.. but tricky,"once you figure out how to use this, it will do you wonders... ok so the trick on how to work it is you need to hold it down for a few seconds, if you just click it once, it wont work... i hope this review was helpful! good luck pranking!"
1,no good,A friend purchased a similar pen that worked both as a pen and had a pretty good shock. This pen's shock is almost not noticeable. New Batteries made no difference.
4,History Revisited,"Elizabeth Flynn is not a gifted writer, so this book makes for ""choppy"" reading. But, she is a powerful, passionate and dedicated woman; an example to young people of the 21st century. She spent time in jail and served for several years as head of the Communist Party in the United States. Yet, I would call her a great American.Reading her story makes one appreciate the progress of Labor in this country and how much we owe those of the early 20th century who put their lives on the line for human dignity."
3,Sent out wrong DVD version.,"I would like to buy this DVD version in Vietnamese so I could introduce others to buy and study more about communist's sins. Unfortunately, seller sent me a wrong version (English). I don't know what to do next"
5,More History is Revealed,"I was amazed at the new information revealed in this film. Also, the world must be reminded to how much evil the human being is capable of committing. On both accounts this film deserves the highest of ratings."
5,Enlightenment,"This DVD is a product from a person from Eastern Europe who has not joined in the ""close your eyes"" policy of Western European leftist intellectuals who always refused to realize the Soviet (criminal) system.Similar to the ""Black Book on Communism"" which resulted in an alarm cry of those leftist intellectuals in Europe because they feared to loose their beloved Soviet System and their dream of Socialism/Communism this DVD is high-lightening the truth about what really happened after the October revolution.....and what happened in the Eastern European states after Roosevelt (and Churchill)gave them away to Stalin after WW II following the Jalta accord!This DVD should be a compulsory part of history lessons in schools and universities.But I doubt it. Media, Historians and Politicians in Western Europe are not prepaired to come up with the truth.They are afraid that the crimes of the Nazis would be relativised and could look smaller in comparison."
5,"This CD is ""Worth The Money!""","When i first listened to this CD I had never liked jazz. But when I heard this I knew that if all jazz sounded like this I would really enjoy jazz. Even though not all jazz sounds like this I still love jazz, so as advice to all the jazz fanatics out there, buy this CD!"
4,"Outdated, but pertinent","While this one came out in the late 60s, the lessons work well for the market of today. It really is a high quality book. An interesting topic in the book covers the age of computers and what he forsaw as an interesting future for investors."
1,This Bedding [is nt good]!,I picked out this bedding because my husband is a sports nut. We received it as a shower gift. I am returning it to the store first thing tomorrow. It is of very poor quality. One set of ties on the bumper pads is sewn on at the wrong spot which makes it impossible to fit on the crib properly. I am very disappointed in this purchase.
1,Cute--But Didn't Match the Crib Set!,Did not match the bumper pad at all. Totally different stripes and the bears were different too.
5,Book of valuable insights,"Bishop Pillai has provided great understanding on many phrases and customs referred to in the Scriptures. To understand that writings of Biblical times had colloquilisms and references to ""had to have been there"" occurances helps open revelations to the actual meanings of several passages of God's word. I also recommend ""Orientalisms of the Bible"" by Dr. Pillai if you can find it. These books out of print has cost us all a valuable source of information."
3,"Interesting, but the tone gets tiresome","This is a good book for getting a better feel of the customs that can cause confusion in the Bible. It helped me to understand some difficult scripture by looking at it from another point of view. However, it got a little tiresome reading about how awful Americans are and how everything in India is better. It came off as condescending at times."
5,Free Drinks ForLadies With Nuts,"This sounds JUST like a book for me, but I gotta ask: Why the heck is it in the list of books for Kindle that come up under the search ""Free nonfiction"" when it costs $2.99?The examples are great, sounds like I'd snort milk, too, but a $2.9 book should not be part of the search yield for ""free nonfiction"" on a Kindle!"
3,Entertaining but overpriced,"This is a rather overpriced but entertaining collection of English phrases as mangled, sometimes quite suggestively (as in the title) by foreigners. Actually, there are a few examples of domestic screw-ups as well from information on the outside of a product (""Directions: use like regular soap.""). Other sources include signs, restaurant menus, movie subtitles, instructions, ads, brand names, advertising slogans, and a truly bizarre interview with Madonna (""Are you a bold hussy-woman who feasts on men who are tops?""). Great bathroom reading but a bit expensive at [price]for under 130 small pages."
2,Too much charge for shipping and return,This one charge too much shipping fee and you have no option to choose cheaper shipping.When I got two sets for my bathroom and found they didn't fit my current valve system even it's exactly same model from Moen so I decided to return. However I was charge 20% restocking fee even I didn't touch anything inside the boxes and return the wholething with orignial packages.
2,The pictures are very misleading,"There are two pictures side by side from the seller. The first picture looks like a zoom-in image of knobs and spray. Then the second one shows the completed suite of the faucet, giving me a feeling that this sale incudes all of these parts. In fact, the seller will only deliver you nothing more than two knobs and one spray. I just called amazon to request a return. Depending on the final return result, I will either down grade the rate to 1 star or upgrade to 3 start. The reason I call it ""misleading"" not ""cheating"" because later, once I got the package, I re-checked the website and found one sentence says ""valve 9000 not included"". I was overwhelmed by the ""convincing"" pictures."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,Have had three of these. One lasted four days. They all suffer from the same problem. The ballasts/starter bulbs go bad and the only functioning part of the unit is the electrical grid which constantly clogs up even on a good day.
2,Defective Bulbs.,"10 to 12 days after receiving original, one light bulb went defective. Replacement unit also had defective bulb that would not light up after 10-12 days. Requesting 2nd (and final) replacement to correct defective bulb. Both times defective bulbs were on the side opposite of the electric pulg in cord. If it worked properly, it would be a good product."
2,Horror comedy that just doesn't work,"Horror comedy is extremely hard to pull off, especially when the premise is bad actors being killed in campy ways. The Ridgeland Community Theater has fallen on hard times, and with good reason. The acting is terrible, the sets look like cardboard children's toys, and the production values are abysmal. But there are still actors who want to be a part of this little theater troupe, and one of them is killing off the cast.Opening Fright could have been ""Waiting for Guffman"" meets ""Friday the 13th,"" but there's just one problem--you can't tell where the intentional bad acting and special effects leave off and the real acting and effects begin. Sorry guys, but at $12, the price of admission is too high."
2,"May appeal to adults, but fails with the 4-5 year old set","In reading the other reviews written about this book, I was struck by how all three of them seem to be written from the perspective of an adult reader. To that extent, I agree with the reviews: the book is quite poignant, and does a beautiful job appealing to an adult's sense of the passage of time and loss. Yet, I believe that it fails in appealing to its target audience of 4-8 year olds. In reading this book to my 4 1/2 year old daughter, she almost immediately tuned out. I believe that the prose is too dense and the ideas overly sophisticated for your average pre-school to kindergarten aged child."
4,Pretty Good,"A very solid introduction to french; grammar and vocabulary usage are usually explained pretty clearly. There's not much more you could ask for. Autodidacts N.B. that the textbook itself contains very little guidance on pronunciation so you should either buy the workbook and cds as well, or find that information elsewhere."
5,Very Helpful!,The company who sold me the book was very helpful in refunding the money and was very kind about the process. I would buy from them again in the future!
3,Didn't fit,My vehicle is a Suburban. Application said it would fit Suburban and pickup. It may fit the pickkup trucks but it is a different story for a suburban. Fortunatly I had a good muffler man who could modify the tail pipe to get around the self leveling shock absorbers and the gas filler neck to get the job done. Once installed I really liked the outcome and it sounds great vs. the resonance of the prior mufler.
1,THIS BURNS ME UP!!!!!!,"This movie is not romantic at all! you think if the movie has romance in the title, that it would be romantic!! Well, it's not. The ending sucks! Most of the movie is LAME! They were all good actors, but if it had been a better script to begin with, it would have been a better movie. I could write a better movie than this! The ending is just so lazy and typical of shows these days! It's like the script writer said ""Oh, well, I'm tired of making this movie, let's just end it now!"" Stupid! at least write two or three more sentences for the movie to have a better ending! For heaven's sakes, at least end the movie with them kissing. it's not like there's going to be a sequel. like he couldn't be in a better movie? just go watch one of his old good movies and don't your waste your time on this."
1,Music????,"This is really not a criticism of the movie but one about the horrible music score. I would feel pity for anybody hearing this awful music in a movie theater. It seems like the ""composer"" had made a CD years ago and decided to just pop it into the film. It's terrible and adds nothing good to the movie."
5,The Tiramisu is the BEST I've ever tasted!,"My husband and I ended up buying a copy of this book for each other for Christmas. It was a good thing we had two copies in the house for a while because neither of us wanted to put it down. Tiramisu is my all-time favorite dessert and I have tried many recipes and variations--both at home and dining out. I made the Tiramisu in this book for a New Year's Eve party and it was BY FAR the most incredibly wonderful piece of tiramisu I have ever had. It was time consuming, but well worth the effort! The other recipes look equally wonderful and I can't wait to try them!"
2,cooking times are off,did anyone else find that her cooking times are all off? try the quick sour cream coffee cake or pumpkin creme brulee following her direction exactly and you will see. I am not a novice baker and am greatly disappointed with the results.
2,returned,"Another nice book by Gale Gand, but not the types of recipes I was looking for or would make. I returned the book."
2,Too complicated,While I was really interested in seeing this book. I tried some of the recipes in here and they were a bit too complicated for the everyday person. I love the idea of a lot of what is in here and I really wanted to love the book. There are a number of recipes in here I still have to try. I have to admit that I have only done about 3 so probably not enough to go on.
4,Nice Import for the price,"If you appreciate jazz compilations from countries outside the USA, then you want to add ""Life is Jazz"" to your collection. The project has several artist with unique styles. The JazzeOne chose `Squeezer' by Eric Le Lann and `Sunday Night' by Bibo as background music for ""Dantz on the Radio"" on the JazzeOne Production website. This CD adds a lot of variety and character that can be described as a cross between acid and beyond jazz. 'Roughneck' by Eddie Roberts puts you in the flavor of the bebop jazz error of the early 1960's. `Madame Mope' by Ozone Cocktail and 'Yunowhathislifeez' by Metropolitan Jazz Affair received satellite radio air play during 2006/2007 in the states and stands out as two jazz vocal sensations.All-in-all for a variety of Jazz to listen to on one CD, ""Life is Jazz"" is a good choice. If you are looking for an import that does not cost $$$ this is an excellent buy and Nice import. ~the JazzeOne"
2,What IS true kung fu?,"Mr. Hsu takes a lot of time describing false Kung Fu, but as mentioned in other reviews here, he only sometimes tells us what true Kung Fu is. Is it what he does and only what he does? How does he know what he does isn't fake? He tackles issues about mixing styles and such (that it is not for the serious practioner), but does he realize that's what people have done for centuries? No! Praying Mantis blends monkey and mantis moves, White Crane mixes birds with the ape,etc. I've looked a long time for a good non-instructional Kung Fu book(with in- depth history and philosophy), and this proves to be a disappointment. Kung fu is way too diverse to generalize into a certain ""way"" like other martial arts. Mr. Hsu attempts to do way too much in so few pages. A noble attempt, yes, but the many flavors of Kung Fu are best left exposed by the many practioners of it."
3,"Interesting Book, But Not What I was Looking For!","I understood when I bought the book that it was a compilation of Sifu Hsu's articles but I thought that the breadth of his articles would be more substantial. Like the other reviewer said, it stated a lot about what isn't Kung Fu, and not so much on what is. I wish he went deeper into principles instead of alluding to them. There were a few choice chapters, but it was funny that everything he refereced was to Chen Style Taiji/Tai Chi. I would have thought he'd reference some of his other styles he knew such as Mantis, Baji or even piqua. Some times he touched on Changquan or Long fist but that was it. I thought it would have been more beneficial if he referenced his other styles or just stuck to body mechanics."
4,"Tough to read, but worth it","I agree with several reviewers that this is a difficult read. Trying to make your way through Yorkshire can be painful and confusing at times. It reminded me of The Secret Garden in that way. Overall, the storyline is fascinating and delves into a part of history most of us never read about. Personally, I assumed it was the 1880s and was thrilled to discover a whole new era. It may be worth hearing on an audio book, depending on how they read it.Great story, tough to sort through."
3,It's Alright.,"It took me some time to actually get into this book... and somewhere about 3/4 the way I lost interest again and just scanned some of the pages. But it's a decent read... it was a free book at the time. I usually like historical fiction books, and it definately had it's interesting and humorous moments."
1,ughh......,"i tried, I really did...but had to quit!! I wanted so bad to be good caz of the other reviews!! Not worth the time."
2,Um...Well...,"So, I can typically put away a book of this size in less than two days. This one is MUCH different. While I appreciate the historical accuracy, the language is SO broken, it's almost impossible to understand. It makes the story VERY hard to follow. And Arabella thinking that ALL children were conceived through Devine intervention? NO woman was that dumb back then, and it makes it almost not worth reading at all. I bought all three books in this series because I love this time period and I love series, but it's almost too much as this point. I'm honestly considering selling them to make room for books that are easier to understand and that don't try so hard to write off the beaten path (formula romance novels for instance) that they stray off in so many other directions that the reader is lost time and again, yet keep the same stupid romance novel story line; stupid, stubborn virgin girl (arabella) and broodish mountain of a man (john)."
3,A personal connection,"I bought this book because of personal historical interest; it is a reprint of the original first ever crossword puzzle book, originally printed in 1924, and my father, at the age of 16, constructed one of the puzzles in the book."
3,Foarm Case for Vista HCx,"A high quality case that allows the use of the unit in-situ. Excellent fit and finish; unhindered access to all buttons and view of screen(protected by an included pre-cut 3M self-adhesive urethane screen protector - 2 x pcs). Unit has to be removed for access to the battery compartment and USB port; not an issue here. The fabric-lined semi-rigid case provides a better grip on the unit but offers little or no shock protection unlike a Gilsson case(which is a hit-or-miss in the fitting department). Excellent protection from scrapes and scratches. Little or no protection from water. Does not add much weight and size to an already small handheld GPS unit. The removable SS belt clip is secure and sturdy. More colours should be offered; orange, yellow, black, woodland camo and etc. Only concerned with the integrated hinge of the two halves which probably has a limited number of open/close cycles. No mention of product warranties. Satisfied overall."
4,Extrex GPS casing,Product arrived in an air sealed bag that prevents the case from being crushed during mail. Case is of good quality & fits like a glove and performs as it should.Would have liked other colors though. Generally a very good product!
5,Fantastic case!,"This case has several features that make it the best ever made for Etrex GPS. Even better than original cover Garmin:- Rough material that does not slip on the outside of the hand and of excellent quality- Prevents accidentally pushing buttons on the GPS- To be strong and rigid truly protects against falls- System of opening and closing genial- Beautiful, but this is subjective- I am 6 months and it seems that will last many yearsAs nothing is perfect, slightly increases the volume of the GPS, but as my Etrex Vista is small, anything that compromises the purchase.The Removable Metal Belt Clip for being very fair, is a bit difficult to put on the belt.Highly recommended!"
3,Nice product - to high a price,A good product. I would have purchased elsewhere if I had found a vendor that was cheaper. Fit and finish good.
5,CANON340,"THIS CANON 340 REPLACED AN HP1522 MULTIFUNCTION ALL-IN-ONE THAT WAS NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS FROM THE TIME I PURCHASED IT AT STAPLES, IT WAS PRONE TO JAMMING AND WITHIN 2 YEARS COMPLETELY FAILED. NOT ONLY WAS THE HP OVERPRICED, BUT THOSE MAIL IN REBATES THEY TOUT ARE A COMPLETE FRAUD. I WISH I HAD KNOW ABOUT THIS COPIER/PRINTER BEFORE I WASTED MY MONEY AT STAPLES, I'D HAVE SAVE A LOT OF GRIEF AND MONEY. IT'S A GREAT BUY FOR THE MONEY, AND I GOT 20 YEARS OF SERVICE FROM AN OLD CANON COPIER FROM THE 80s. THIS COPIER/PRINTER IS SO MUCH QUIETER AND SMOOTHER THAN THAT HP -- AND IT W-O-R-K-S BEAUTIFULLY!!!!"
5,Awesome,We are so pleased with this copier. We have always chosen Canon because we've had such good experiences with Canon. This is the best printer. We shopped on Amazon and found the best price. Yesterday our computer support person hooked up this copier to our two work computers and we no longer need the printer we were using with expensive ink cartridges. Note we only print in black ink at work. It has many wonderful features. Can't say enough about it.
5,copier,"Very prompt shipment, in excellent condition. Priced very competitively. I would purchase again from this source."
5,Great Product!!Great Price!!!,This is the best value that I found anywhere. Works better than expected. Very fast start up time. Easy to use.
1,Look elsewhere...,"Bought this scope on a whim as astronomy and the study of the stars has always been of interest to me since I was a kid. Set up was relatively easy, but once I looked through it...oh the disappointment. I was able to set up the viewfinder, but mount failed to keep objects within the finders field of view. And once you get something in the scope, the vibration and poor mount make it impossible to even focus without causing the scope to go into an irritating bout of shaking. I tried it for 4-5 nights in a row, and returned it. I went out and bought a cheap 10X50 set of binoculars and they work as well, without headache of this scope.On a good note, it looks nice. Too bad the functionality is utterly unreasonable."
5,Great start to a new album,"The Mission are back and here's their first single from their new album ""God Is A Bullet""If you thought they were stuck in the 80's heyday then think again - this single proves that this band still has what it takes to make great records and sounds very contemporary. This is definately not a goth sound - this is a band showing they can bring it.Long live The Mish!"
4,"Sounds like the Mish, without being dated.","For Mission fans, this is a decent bit of a new sound without losing the integrity of the sound we all fell in love with back in the 80's. A lot of us Mish fans sadly still become weary of anything new by the Mission after Masque... but this new album is quite delightful. You can hear the old production style, tied in with the music - and while it has a slightly (slightly) more updated feel --- there will be no doubt this is THE MISSION (UK)."
2,Not What I Was Looking For,"After my initial recovery from an RCL tear in my left thumb (7 weeks in a cast, 8 weeks in a removable hard splint, and 11 weeks of OT), I was looking for a brace that would support my thumb but allow movement of my wrist. I'm pretty active in exercise(swimming, yoga, Pilates, aerobics, water aerobics, weight training), so I needed something that I could wear while doing these activities. The CHAMPION Neoprene Wrist/Thumb Support did not have the support I was looking for. I wore it once during a water aerobics class and in order to get any support from this item I had to adjust the tightness to the point that my hand went numb. This product would be great if it had some support bars along the sides and top of the thumb."
4,wrist/thumb support,"Works wonderfully, is reasonably priced and easy to use. My only negative would be that you have to take it off to shower or do dishes, anything that would get it wet as it would take forever to dry."
2,"does not fit well, causes dumbness","Bought one for my wife when she was experiencing pain in wrist and thumb from holding our newborn. Measured her wrist to be about 5.9 inches in circumference, so it is within the range recommended for the small size. With the Velcro strap aligned properly, it was too loose and did not provide much wrist support at all. To get it tighter, we had to stick the velcro on the blue part of the wrap. However, wearing it tight like this to support the wrist caused thumb numbness after a few minutes, so she stopped using it."
4,Wilson A 1010 Blems,"I would recommend this product and they are great for hitting. they seem soft and you may want a higher quality ball for pitching purposes, but great for the price."
2,Too much $,"I am a big fan of BTNH, but I'm tired of spending so much money on bull. This dvd should be around $8. I'm not saying the DVD is bad, just expected more for $20+"
4,The King Of Pop.......,I like the DVD.....mostly for the Oprah part of it. I wanted to have this show of Micheal Jackson on DVD and it is pretty good quality....I have this one and volume 2 and I love both! A must for a true MJ fan!! XO L.O.V.E! :)
3,Loved the Content - wished the quality was better,"I only purchased Volume 1 - while I love the content, on some of the interviews, especially the one with the Japanese interviewer where MJ is giggling - the picture and sound quality were really poor. I did enjoy the interview with Oprah - the sound and quality were very good. If the quality of the picture and sound was better on some sessions of the DVD, so too would have been my rating because the content is 5 star."
5,I collect M.J. music and interviews..,I really enjoyed this video and wished there were more of M.J. out there. I will add this to my collection and watch for more. Thank You Amazon for fast delivery and great tracking.
2,You can find these on YouTube,I rented these DVDs. I was disappointed that someone is selling these interviews to make money. All of these interviews are on YouTube. Some of it is very poor video quality.
4,Oprah's Interview with Michael Jackson,"I am very glad to see the complete interview of Michael that Oprah did back in the 1980's. The interview that someone did at Michael's homehas too much background noise. The quality of the sound is poor. I was not pleased with the lack of divisions that DVD's come with that allow you to skip from oneinterview to the another without having to scroll through all of the tape to find what you want efficiently. That is too time consuming. I am glad that itincludes the interviews with Barbara Walters and Diane Sawyers. I will look for a better quality DVD of Michael's interviews, but I am glad to have this volume1."
3,poor quality,"The quality of the dvd is very poor, granted it was recorded in 1980,1990s but it could of been updated or better quality. I love Michael jackson so I watched it and kept it anyways."
1,Why So Secretive?,"I have reason to be suspicious of materials on Michael Jackson that give you NO review of it from the person who produced it! Why isn't there any synopsis of what the interviews are? It is an insult to me that the producer of this video chooses to not tell the potential customer anything about the product! I refuse to give money to people who don't seem to care enough about me as a Michael Jackson fan. It seems that you have something to hide....if this is NOT the case, then give a description of this video. Is that too much for the customer to ask?! I don't think so."
1,No description?????,"I have wasted money and time by purchasing pre-order items in the past. If you really want to see the very few interviews Michael Jackson agreed to doing (Oprah, Walters & Bashir) simply log onto You Tube. You'll save your money and it's not a waste of time."
3,Michael Jackson Interviews,"I bought the 4 individual DVD's, Interviews Vol. 1 & 2, Fan Camera Footage, and Press Conferences. All 4 of these DVD's are the same as what is in the Mega Box, which is half the price of these 4 DVD's. The only difference is that you don't get the postcards with the Mega Box. Some of the interviews are worth watching, but I suggest saving some money and buying the Mega Box instead of the 4 individual DVD's. If the write-up for the Mega Box had said that it was those same 4 DVD's, I wouldn't have purchased the individual ones AND the Mega Box. But I didn't know, so they got an extra $65 dollars from me that I shouldn't have had to spend. Oh, well. Live and learn!"
5,This is truly a great book,"My take on Sara Monday is very different from what I'm reading here. I believe that she loved life and indulged herself in its pleasures. At the same time she was a nurturing soul. Read it for yourself to decide about her character. Gulley Jimson is also a great character. The descriptions in this book are wonderful. She describes the sea as being like oven glass one day and the edges of knives another. It is so good that I didn't want it to end, and now I'm going to read the other two books in the trilogy."
5,Old Africa-brought to life,"It's a very real look at Old Africa. It shows the truth of man's bad luck, bad descisions, greed, and life filled with hard times. It shows nature in it's true self, not some Disney version of happy animals dancing around. This is an excellent book and should serve as a wake up call for the multitudes of Americans who believe the garbage that is spoon fed to them on their televisions. It may be well more than most readers can handle, because the truth is not sugar coated here."
3,The end of the big game - A book to protect today'swildlife,"Published in 1965, the book is the most famous book of Peter Beard. The book is shoking as most photos are pictures of dead animals, it is definitely not a book to look at before your safari. Black and white pictures are excellent. Sadly, the last pages are only photos of elephant's carcasses (too much?). The Beard's touch is a book full of old illustration, tiny pics, small and odd drawings and detailed texts - most of them taken from the British Museum. The book is about the Old Africa and text about Mt Kenya, the Man-eaters of Tsavo, Nairobi and Karen Blixen are not easy and you must have a knowledge of Kenyan history to understand them fully. This book is essential for any African collection as it has shocked and marked history."
2,package/wrapping of bad quality,"I thank you for sending me the above book .Unfortunately the cover was peeled off because the glue inside the envelope was directly in contact with the book cover. And before I opened the package I could see through a hole on top of the envelope that the book cover was damaged. Perhaps the book should have been seperately wrapped in plain paper, before being enclosed in the envelope.Thank you for your understanding."
1,Pictures of Dead Animals,"I thought this book would be a collection of pictures of endangered animals, but no. These are pictures of DEAD animals. And in various stages of decay. I was too grossed-out to read the text."
4,Works great for me,"sure it does have an assembly but its two tools in one, i use the steering wheel holder only, works great, actually it works better than the guys next to me who uses a snap on off the truck one, it is cheaper made but look at the price, like i said works great for me"
5,The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene,Interesting possibilities emerge in a reader's mind as one sees Mary Magdalene's interaction with Jesus and the apostles. This book examines all sides of the biblical stories and raises provoking thought of her role in the life of Jesus. The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene is done with careful research and it encourages thought and discussion.I consider the controversies here a challenge to the curious reader and ones to fire the imagination of the poorly informed. I give the book five stars.
2,Good......but hardly a breakthrough,"As one might expect, the scholarship of Jane Schaberg is of a very high standard. However, she takes far too much mileage from the supposition that the word ""Magdalene"" means from the modern Israeli town of Migdal. There is absolutely no evidence that Migdal, like Nazareth, existed during the early first century. Magdalene and Nazarene are no doubt important titles, but what they might actually mean is apparently of no concern to Schaberg. So she imposes onto the ancient Jews a westernized set of norms that don't threaten her presuppositions. The upshot is that the reader is no closer to understanding Mary Magdalene."
4,New perspective,"Having never given much thought to Mary Magdalene, a professor suggested this book. It read well and helped me view Mary Magdalene more positively. A stronger woman than I through."
1,Save your time and money...,"This book is not written well, it is not well researched, the writer has no experience in the subject she is trying to cover. She makes wild assertions without having the slightest clue of the ethos of the people she is trying to write about. She hasn't the slightest clue of what monasticism is, she has not concept of a sacramental understanding of Christianity, sacred space, Apostolic Tradition.This book fails in every way.Save your money and your time."
4,Old Belilevers,"The Times of London has a story on the Old Believers of Buryatia in the February 21, 2001 edition. If you have read this book, you will find the story interesting. I thought this was a great book, and gave me better understanding of the underlying causes of the dislike of America in the Eastern European countries today. In Lingua Franca magazine of March 2001 is the story of how Bulgarian Jews were saved in WWII."
1,Biased beyond belief,This book begins with the author feeling oppressed that she cannot get on to Mt. Athos. Athos like most monastic environments is segregated by gender. (I can't enter the clositer-enclosure of a convent of Carmelite nuns either). This diatribe aginst the Holy Mountain and its 1000 year old traditions signals the author's extreme bias against Orthodoxy Orthodoxy is seen as the source of all the evils and problems in Post-Soviet Eastern Europe. If you are looking to understand Orthodoxy avoid this book and read something by Seraphim Rose or Timothy Ware.
3,Life in a sleepy Kentucky county,"Memoir-like drama is perfectly readable and engaging but suffers somewhat from occasional dryness and an abrupt ending. There are also several disturbing instances of animal cruelty, undertaken by the bored young boys in the story. Ultimately, it's the colorful yet sensitive characterizations of the uncle and grandfather characters that make the book worth one's time.Those attracted to minimalist, lyrical prose will likely enjoy ""Nathan Coulter"" (the first entry in Wendell Berry's ""Port William"" series) more than those who prefer more descriptive, meaty reading experiences."
2,Georgie,"Not nearly as good as I wanted it to be - very slow moving with pedestrian content, and not much action. Maybe I was just not in the mood for what was offered."
4,Great Lion of God,Taylor Caldwell has always been one of my favorite authors. I had read this book many years ago and wanted to read it again. I am enjoying it very much.
2,Redundant and Tiresome,"I got through about 250 pages before I finally became discouraged. The constant preaching of the tone of the book is tiresome as if the feels that the reader will not see her point without constant preaching. I wanted to read about St. Paul, but I will look elsewhere.While I enjoy a good, long story, this book should be condensed by at least 50%. Obviously, it appealed to a number of reviewers, so I would suggest reading 100 pages. If you are not into the book, put it down. It does not get better and is not for you."
5,Quick and Easy,"Thanks to Amazon for the quick response to my whim for a re-read of that wonderful Taylor Caldwell volume from the '70s. Based on the life of the Apostle Paul, ""Great Lion of God"" was soon at my door. My order was filled right away; what a bargain I got! With so little effort, almost the snap of my fingers, and I'm enjoying my book just a few short days later!"
5,Get hooked on Taylor Caldwell,"This was the very first biographical novel I read by Taylor Caldwell. She can tell a story like no one else. After reading this book when it first came out in 1970, I couldn't wait to devour everything else she has written. Her forte seems to be novels based on the lives of historical people. Great Lion of God is about St. Paul, Dear and Glorious Physician about St. Luke, Pillar of iron about Cicero, another about Genghis Khan, etc. These are just the beginning for this prodigous writer. She says in the foreward of one of her famous novels that she had translated the original latin and greek herself at the Vatican and other sources. That impressed the hell out of me! She is a great storyteller. Pick up any of her books and you are in for a treat."
3,typical product not outstanding,"As usual the factory obviously never installed this product on an actual vehicle, had to do a custom install on my vehicle which took alot longer than if they got it right from the factory!"
4,Excellent for personal studies!,"I studied English literature in college as well as some upper level French, but this is my first serious endeavor to study French literature. I like the structure and organization of the book very much! There is plenty of cultural, historical, and literary context for each movement, as well as introductions to each author and suggestions for further study. Each poem has a page by page translation to help with vocabulary building, but no other critique offered on the poem itself.I like the book because it is well balanced but allows the reader to explore at his or her own pace. With plenty of information to read, but structure to skip over what you like, I think this book is well suited for those who would like to peruse it in their own leisure!"
5,They work,"I have tried to use ""compatible"" cartridges with my I-70 without success. The OEMs cost more but the work so I guess cost is relative.Items came on time and in good condition."
5,Thanks Amazon,Product & delivery met or exceeded the excellence I've found to be the norm at Amazon.Robert
4,Convenient,This has been a very useful product. It is small and compact and easy to carry with my mobile canon printer. It is great and very convenient especially when I have to be going from one place to another. Thank you.
2,Ink cartridge is small,Ink cartridge runs out fast. I wish they use a bigger cartrige for the printer.
3,expected a little bit more,"I have had my printer for about 1.5-2 months now.Although I know this is a printer designed for travellers, and hence not a workhorse, but I was rather expecting somewhat more from my printer cartridge. I honestly only print a few pages here and there, mainly airline receipts, small documents, etc...The 'warning your ink level is low' sign just came on, and I would have printed no more than 50 pages.That seems rather pricey in my book!"
3,Canon Black Ink Cartridge,"I thought the price was very good; however, I could not get the ink cartridge to work. It may have been old and/or dry. Again, I know from previous purchases that it was a good buy but it wasn't worth the postage for me to send back. Would I buy again.....probably."
4,Good Deal,I was happy with my purchase. It was much less expensive than purchasing at local retail stores. The only thing that prevented me from giving this 5-stars is that the ink cartridges came in individual packs and not in the original 2-pack Canon box that is shown on the page.
1,Ink Arrived Dry and Unusable,Both ink cartridges in this boxed package came dried up and unusable.I will now have to a) go to the local store to buy a new set of ink and b) try to return these dried ones to amazon.I suggest purchasing ink at your local Staples/OfficeDepot/OfficeMax where you can return the ink in person.
2,Not enough ink,The cartridge does not hold enough ink. It prints 50 pages maximum. That equates to $.24 / page of copy. WAAAAAY to expensive.FRS
5,Unique music from a terrific band,"Boyd Raeburn's band was one of the most innovative of its time, one in which swing, bebop and symphonic music were combined in a totally unique way. My only caveats are that tracks 13 and 16 are reversed ('Hip Boyd's' is actually 'Duck Waddle' and vice versa) and that the last four tracks are actually Johnny Richards recordings (Raeburn's last arranger) featuring Boyd's male vocalist, but since there are 26 tracks, that isn't so bad. Some of the music is absolutely transcendental, and most of the recording quality is excellent. I highly recommend this recording to anyone who would like to hear big-band swing stretch itself!"
4,Rip!,"I'm a sucker for humorous jazz vocals so this CD was worth the price just to get the studio version of ""Rip Van Winkle"" featuring Ginny Powell.As for the rest of the album - well these versions might not be quite as exciting as some live renditions of the same tunes, but the sound quality of these studio cuts makes this lp essential for Raeburn fans.Was there ever a white big band hipper than Raeburn's? Even Herman's Herd sounds almost square next to these guys. And Kenton? To quote Anita O'Day, ""Stanley wouldn't swing if you hung him with a rope!"""
5,Love the originality,"I seen The Cat Empire on David Letterman. I liked the song they sang, Sly, so I bought the CD.Their style is original, you can actually dance to it. It's a little jazzy, and a little big band era, some comedy, and much more.They have one other CD and I will be getting that one."
2,one hit wonder,"After seeing this band on a night show performing ""Sly"", I bought this CD. ""Sly"" is the only song on it that's really catchy in my opinion."
5,If you want a band the plays the same ole thing dont buy this!!,"I first heard this band on a free sample down load of ""Hello"" from Amazon and I could not figure it out. It was cool and jazzy and I could not put it in any specific catagory. All I knew is that I liked it.The I heard the Two Shoes CD. Well, I still can't place this band's music into any one category. They are all over the place, but that is what make then one of the best band I've heard in the last couple of years. From the cuban inspired ""sol y sombra"" to the dixie landish ""salt water"" they would make any party jump and any drive in the car a hot jumpin experience.I hear that they are all the rage down underBuy this CD!!!!"
5,When Let's Go Bowling jam with the Orishas,"This CD is so fresh, exciting and upbeat, I can't get enough of this band. I got to see them twice when I was living in Sydney, and both times didn't stop dancing the whole night. This is the most talented and energetic group of musicians I've heard in a long time. Each song on this CD is a gem from the sweet and sexy ""Lullaby"" to the fun, nostalgic ""Salt Water"". This album is a must have."
3,Prefer her Weather Warden series,"After devouring all three of Caine's Weather Warden series (if you haven't read them yet, go buy Ill Wind right now! Now!) I had high expectations for this book that weren't quite fulfilled. I'm not sure why--it was an interesting plot, interesting characters, etc. I just never really sympathized with any of them, except for one secondary character who happened to be in jail as a serial killer. Hmm. While this is definitely worth a read, and I'll check out the sequel, I can only give it three stars, because it just doesn't have the verve and hook that her other books do."
5,Really enjoyable new series by Ms. Caine.,"I am a fan of Rachel Caine's Weather Warden series and decided to check out this new series she has in the works by Harlequin/Bombshell. I found this first book to the series really enjoyable and could not put it down.First off, Caine has written some really interesting characters- Jazz, Lucia, Borden, Manny- all are different yet believable and work well in the context of the greater story.The plot setting was interesting as well, and I was intrigued by the Cross Society, the idea of Leads and Actors. The questions and suspense kept coming and by the end of the book you are left scratching your head over the mystery and where it is leading.All in all, a great story. This book is different from her Weather Warden series but just as well written and interesting. At best I would call this a paranormal mystery series in the works. So if you are a fan of Caine's, check this new series out and for the price it is a really good bargain!Great job, Ms. Caine!"
3,Confused,"A great book, Confusing, but still a great book. I love Rachel Caine and own a few of her books. How ever this book left me wondering what was going on. 1st thing that through me off a little bit was the level of ... for a lack of a better word right now... macho-ism was completely switch. I found Borden, sexy, but very Sissy, and Jazz tougher then nails. But opposites do attract, right? He kinda grows on you after awhile. Anyways The Plot and pace was another place I had some problem getting into it. there was a lot of setting up of the investigating business, and not too much action going on. There was a hint of romance. I was hoping it would go on a little more, but it ended. So my conclusion is maybe this is just a book to set up the series. The writing style was excellent. I have the 2nd book. Both provided for an honest review, so Stay tuned to see what the next book has in store. - Were Vamps Romance"
3,Easy to apply but my cat licks it,The gel is not very thick. Easy to apply especially when the hair is in the way. I could't tell if this stops the itch. My cat licks it right after I put it on. So I only used it once.
3,slowly works,"I have a cat who seems to keep getting fleas, I have bomb my house twice along with flea dips and baths. She has scratched and chewed at her skin so much she is missing hair and has several sores. I am trying this product along with others to cure the rash and skin issues. This seems to be helping and I don't see my cat licking it off. I just wish it would heal the skin faster."
2,defective,Delivery was prompt. The low pressure fitting was defective. (too Tight)I repaired it by removing the O ring and sanding out the ID. Works fine now.
2,Low side failed,I purchased this because my current AC hose's low pressure coupler began leaking. I replaced it with the one from this package. It worked for one day and then the next it started to leak. I was very disappointed in the low quality. I didn't try it in time to be able to return it. Buyer beware.
2,Not what I expected,"The book was written for beginning readers and I liked that aspect of the book. Scholastic usually doesn't let me down but it did in this case. The book discusses several ways of dealing with anger that are acceptable in some situations. However, most teachers and parents would agree that the coping strategies suggested aren't the best. I would have hoped that suggestions like, stomp your feet, would have been left out. Furthermore, one idea is to walk away (from a friend) and then on the next page is states to talk to a friend. Which is it? I feel that if young children read the book without discussing the story with an adult that they may come away with inappropriate strategies for dealing with anger."
3,Fuller past his prime?,"This C.D. has some great tunes, and Curtis's solos on Blues-ette, Capt. Kid and a few other sound like his usual swingin' self, but on most of the songs his articulation is nothing like the great stuff he did in the fifties. He almost sounds like Roswell Rudd at times. I would reccommend Blues-ette number 1 way before this album."
1,"Not reliable, be careful!","DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM QuickAutoHouse Co!!They have cheated on me by sending an used, defective and damaged product. Be carefull!! This is a totally unreliable seller, he has cheated on me by a deceitful clause in the sending policy.I repeat: Do Not BUY ANYTHING from this dishonest sellers!"
1,Old data,"Book is very thin and has outdated information. One example is the XM-21, referring to the M-21 rifle when it was experimental. That was back in the late 60's if I remember correctly. That will give you an idea about the text of the gear and tactics used in the book."
1,Counter Sniper Guide,"Get the Military and Police Sniper, or Sniper Training FM 23-10.The Counter Sniper guide it has 27 pages that are vauge."
3,Battery life,"I like the watch. It was exactly what I was looking for. The only problem was approx. 8 days after I received it, the battery went dead. I had to puchase a new one. No one should have to do that after buying a ""NEW"" watch!!"
4,An Unusal Story for Preschoolers and Aspiring Scientists,"In 1992, a crate of 29,000 rubber bathtub toys washed overboard off a ship bound from Hong Kong to Washington, USA. Hundreds of toys have since been found in coastlands around the world, shedding light on our understanding of how currents, winds and tides interact. This book traces the story of one bathtub toy from the time its crate boards the ship until it is found by a boy in Alaska. The story draws young readers in by personifying the toy as if it is experiencing its journey as a sentient creature. Caldecott Medal Winner David Wisniewski illustrates the story in cut-paper collage, skillfully rendering the dramatic power of the ocean without being too frightening. This is an unusual story that may not appeal to every reader, but for those who prefer ""real"" stories or who are interested in science, it's a sure winner. It's best suited for preschoolers and early elementary readers."
5,Love it!,"I can't think of anything negative to say about this cup. It is perfect. It keeps my drink cold, it's pretty, and it doesn't break when you drop it."
4,pretty good overview,"This movie was a pretty good over view of all the aspects of a dolphin. There were good details about some of the unique anatomical adaptations that dolphins have that make them so special. Lots and lots of videos, not the same stuff over and over which is wonderful."
5,Socks...,"The socks are great, they feel like you are floating in the air. Pricey though, but i think they were worth it."
3,Be careful size charts very,I ended up looking at the size chart and it was inaccurate to the actual size of sock I got.
4,Surprising,A typical horror book where the killer seems to point to different people at different times... very worth reading... totally unexpected ending...!
5,There Will Never Be Another You,This was an unexpectedly good book. Once I started it I couldn't put it down. I finished it in a couple of hours. It was a very real story with a strange twist. I thought about it a lot after I finished it. I am surprised it isn't on a best seller list. If Oprah was still doing her old book club it would be an Oprah pick for sure.
4,Carolyn See Classic,"A beautiful book and a heartfelt message to us from one of the most generous of writers. I gulped it down and I will go back and read it over again. You know, a lot of younger writers are full of surprises and twists. Their novels just scream, ""I am fantastic!"" But the novels of mature writers tend to settle down a little bit, they are more subtle, don't shout so much. But then they somehow change you on a submolecular level.Read everything Carolyn See has ever written, she is amazing."
1,There will never be another book as bad as this,"I guess I can't complain since I didn't actually spend money on this but borrowed it from the local library. I guess I'll never get my time back. The characters were not interesting and more annoying than anything, and the plot was absurd. It was some time ago when I read this, I do read a lot of books - I'm trying hard to push this one out of my mind. I don't know anything about the author's other books -she seems to be well recommended. I can't recommend this book though you might want to try it out for yourself based on some of the more positive reviews."
3,Not for Design Work,"The good new is that this is a fantastic printer for photos. Super quality.For layout and design, it just won't work. PDFs, for example WILL NOT print correctly on the page. Precise locations for elements will not print where specified.Canon's response is this situation is the printer as designed exclusively for photos. Well, that's obviously not the case given that its output options include Legal, ledger, envelope, etc. Many people buy a wide-format machine for more that simply photos and it would be nice if Canon related this limitation as part of its product description.Secondly, the printer will not print Custom Paper Sizes correctly in Mac OSX. Another MAJOR LIMITATION.If Canon would address these issues, it would be just an amazing machine...to bad.LC"
5,Awesome/Fast/Savings,"I have always been an HP fan for some reason... I probably thought they were best. Recently, I decided to purchase the Canon i9100 for long term cost savings (My cost of $15/color). Now that I have it... it prints beautiful camera images and it prints them FAST! I am very happy with it, no problems so far. I have been putting ILFORD paper through the printer with excellent results... plus it is wide carriage for enlargements up to 13""x19""...wow. I have no trouble recommending this printer...it wastes less consumables than other printers."
3,Epson user switches to Canon,"+: Wide format, fairly affordable (especially since the recent price drop), Print heads are less troublesome than on Epson models, ink tanks seem to last longer than with Epson printers (maybe because I am not cleaning them constantly), it's quiet, makes nice photos, and my favorite - print head assembly is replaceable!-: Annoying to customize settings in OS X.. actually, I haven't been able to choose a custom paper size yet, sometimes output is enlarged (I know - weird, right?), had problems with saving color settings, prints like crap on plain or non-inkjet art paper (Epson is better here)."
4,Almost Great,"This is a great printer, but no one, including Canon carries 13""x19"" card-stock paper. I bought this printer with idea that I'ld be able to print my own 13x19 colored signs (100 at a time) but alas, no paper is available."
2,"Great pictures, high cost ink, limited printer life","I have used the S9000 for three years, mainly to print 11x17 drawings. It has been a flawless printer, but today I purchase another brand. I am so mad I could spit!Apparently the Canon products have a spent ink container that cannot be self serviced. There isn't a sensor to indicate that it is filled, the printer just stops working after a given time period or set number of copies. I have tried the internet codes to reset the printer, but to no avail.The local Canon service center wants $100 to reset the codes. Add to the fact that a complete Canon ink refill is about $90 and this printer is too expensive to keep.Whatever marketing genius came up with this plan to get more money from their client base has lost my loyalty and business forever."
1,Junk,"I purchased the i9100 after my old hp died. I searched the webread reviews and everything looking for the best printer, not considering cost. I thought this was it, but not so, it was, in my opinion junk. MY old hp that cost 130 dollars printed circles around this thing. It must be just this one, I can't believe a 500 dollar printer prints like this. I'm returning this one and ordering a new one just to see if I got a bad one. I call tech support went through the stuff ......no good, tryed everything dumb and not so dumb blotchie and faded color not even useable let along state of the art."
5,Seinfeld,great starter to the great Seinfeld seasons. These first few episodes help viewers to understabnd the basic storey line.
1,A show about nothing... it lives up to it's expectations!,"Bluntly: when Seinfeld ended in 1998, it should have been left there, not dragged into the new millenium.My opinion, this show really has nothing to offer. The only interesting fact about this series is how the writers managed to make a refrence to Superman in every episode.I read on a website Seinfeld is now airing in syndication and will continue to air until at least 2011. Why bother?"
1,Greed and stupidity,"Greed and stupidity. Those are the 2 reasons Seinfeld hasn't made it to DVD. In the old days Movie execs were afraid of Video, now they make billions off them, much more than they make of the theatrical releases. TV execs are afraid that syndication deals will go bad if the DVD comes out. Think of the comercial bucks lost if we all have our own Seinfeld versions.Note: I would give this DVD a higher rating if it existed"
1,just record your favorites on DVD yourself :o),"Jon,Baboo is from Pakistan, not India.With all these complaints about personal Seinfeld tape recordings being unreliable, with inferior quality, and aging etc, why not just get a DVD set-top recorder already and record your favorites onto recordable DVD? Sounds like the reason why SeinDVDs aren't out yet are for the fact that everyone watches them on TV and the fanbase increases and increases worldwide....and it's still making money on the TV. If people really want DVD, stop watching them on the TV :) A whole season would be what....like $50 or more? Multiply that by 9 and you have $450. Add a inflation equal to the time it takes for all 9 seasons to be available and you have maybe $700+ cost. Invest that money in a set-top DVD recorder and record your own personal favorites like you would VCR. The commercials would be a nostaglic :O) Cause who really cares to watch all of the episodes. And remember this... SEINFELD will always be on the tube."
5,quick delivery; good product.,dvd delivered four business days after purchase even though i only specified for regular shipping. clearly a new product.
5,Incredible,"If you are a fan of Seinfeld (and let's face it, who isn't?) then you should consider purchasing this set."
5,IT'S NOT YOU IT'S US - says SONY,"I've been watching this show since I got off the boat in 1993. It's absolutely the best, no comparison! I want that DVD and I want it now! Otherwise I'll conclude that all of the Sony executives are sissies and should wear braziers!By the way: ""Friends"" suck (Typical Barbie&Bimbo; show) :)"
2,5 stars for the show 2 stars for the dvd package,"The case the dvds come in is flimsy and worthless and all the dvd cases look the exact same from the side so if you have multiple seasons you can't tell what disc is from what season and you just can't tell one disc from another by looking at the cases. Doesn't make me want to collect them at all, just makes me want to buy them to watch one time then sell."
5,GREAT BUY!,"There is no way you can like the later seasons of seinfeld and not like the first two seasons.I mean this is where it all began, you can see how each character develops from early on. I love all the episodes of seinfeld and friends, and I cant wait until the rest of seinfeld seasons are released. Definetly not the best quality picture but I think kramer is even funnier in these early seasons than in the later ones. Go out and get the first 3 seasons soon."
5,MUST BUY!,"ORDER ARRIVED ON TIME. EVERYTHING WAS IN ORIGINAL PACKAGING. THE PRICE WAS A STEAL. IF U LOVE SEINFELD LIKE I DO, THEN THIS IS A MUST BUY."
4,The evolution of one of the greatest shows on TV...,"It's been so long since I've watched the show's first or second seasons straight through that there were a few episodes that I had completely forgotten about (odd, considering I see at least an episode a day playing in syndication on 5 different channels), which was a nice surprise. You can really see the way the show evolved from a more traditional sitcom (though never cliche or obvious) to what it's known for--a show about nothing--which is also really interesting.The DVD set also has some really great extras, way better than what you get on most boxed sets. The commentaries are interesting and funny (especially the ones with Larry David), and I usually am not a huge fan. There are also ""notes about nothing"" which you can turn on or off like subtitles, which provide factoids about the show and each episode.This is really worth checking out--highly recommended!"
5,The Best sitcom around's start is still just as relevant,"Seinfeld is arguably the greatest sitcom of all time by making a bold decision in making a sitcom purely about everyday stuff like Soup Nazis or ""Friends With Privaleges"" deals. In the first and second seasons the show changed television by, instead of making a show about spys or other ridiculous non-beliveable subjects, made a show about the every day human life which is essentially ""Nothing""!!!! That is why seinfeld,whether about ridiculous food waits in chinese and other restuarants or about the sweet sweet taste of revenge, has still left a mark on television that can never be removed or copied, which is proof that Seinfeld, the smartest,cleverest,and possibly funniest, sitcom of all times is still just as relevant..."
5,Can't believe it!!,I can't believe that the Seinfeld series is not available on DVD. Festivus just wasn't complete with out it!! When it becomes available you will have a sure sale from me!
4,Great show!,"We watch episodes almost everyday! Very funny, entertaining and this show makes us laugh and smile. Can't wait to get season three."
5,love seinfeld!,great series and wonderful cast. order was sent fast and quality is good. will be ordering more stuff soon. satisfied
4,The greatest serie,"This is the best group of people I ever saw. As this serie is still one of the most popular in Latin America, it should come with subtitles in spanish."
1,What a lame show,"I heard many good things about seinfeld and one day I decided to watch it, but I couldn't sit through one episode, I kept hearing laughs and laughs over jokes or things that just didn't think were funny at all.I know there are many fans of this show out there, but if you ask me, Seinfeld is pure cr@p."
5,Legendary stuff...,I just saw the release date for the first season on an Australian DVD retail site...given as 15th November 2004 so if everything happens as it usually does maybe it will be released in the US before that.Great classic comedy...
5,Seinfeld Waiting,"After watching most of the shows, Seinfeld should be on video. I would love to buy it when it comes out. The show is so funny, why couldn't it be on DVD? All the other recent shows like Sex and the City and Buffy are already out and they were made after Seinfeld was over."
5,One of the best,"For some strange reason us folks in the Antipodes have been given the rare privilege of a release of these sets before the US. I haven't laughed so much in ages. This set is brilliant. Sure, they're still finding their feet in the first few episodes, but it is great from the outset. George, in particular, is hysterical. The added extras, bloopers, deleted scenes and the doco on the making of the series all make this set (which would've been great with just the episodes) outstanding value for even the most casual fan of the series. Don't hesitate - you won't regret it. If this doesn't make you laugh, you'd better get medical attention pronto!"
1,The Greatest Comedy has the worst commentary,"Jerry and Larry are so unprepared in their commentary on this DVD (OK I could only listen to their first one). After seeing so many great movie and TV commentaries (take any Buffy DVD season for example) how dissapointing it was to hear Jerry and Larry talk about ""nothing"". A big disappointment for all to the fans who have waited for this DVD release. My rating is on the commentary.... Seinfeld as a show is the greatest so buy the DVD sets."
5,Seinfeld - Seasons 1 & 2,My husband loves his DVD. They were in like new condition for a great price!
5,Seinfeld - Lovin' every minute of it,"If you're a Seinfeld fan you will love this set. Some of the features I've enjoyed are the Kramer entrance counter and the Jerry girlfriend counter along with the pop-up video-ish interesting facts about the show, stars etc. The best DVD tv series boxed set ever. Worth every cent."
2,Don't Forget the Special Features!!!,"I've been a fan since 1995 after I moved out to go to college, living on my own and looking for something to keep me company and I don't know how I would've ever survived! Let's keep the memories alive with DVD's OK? I really NEED those lessons I didn't learn in college about how to be the most annoying, biggest complainer and best griper around! And by the way I expect those DVD's to have an outtakes reel, commentaries, behind the scenes, a Seinfeld quiz to see which character is most like you, a day on the set of..."
4,"Sorry to spoil the party, but....","...I'm going to do a proper review not just a gush-piece about how great it is that the DVD is coming!First of all, I think these first series had a quiet charm about them. They were plausible, and the characters at least passably likeable. E.g in 'The Jacket', George and Jerry stuck by Elaine and didn't abandon her cranky dad...which you wouldn't have blamed them for doing. The early series also include Jerry's stand up routines, which I like!Now, some people prefer the later series, many of which omit the stand up routines, and show the main characters to be selfish, and mean. Each to their own but I prefer the earlier ones. You could empathinse more with the gang back then."
5,Jerry Seinfeld - my stress relief,"Being a Japanese college student in America, I didn'tunderstand American humor at first, however as time passedby and my language skill progressed, I was able to catchwhat was funny and what was not so funny.I had a chance to watch JERRY SEINFELD once and I wastotally hooked since then and since I've been back inJapan and whenever my job send me back to the States,I make sure to watch Jerry Seinfeld.That's been my #1 favorite show and I'VE BEEN WAITING FORTHE SHOW BECOMES A ""DVD"" so that I can enjoy it in Japan wheneverI want to. PLEASE MAKE A DVD ""JERRY SEINFELD"" ASAP!!!"
5,please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Seinfeld, a great show to watch a thousand times. So please put the episodes on DVD so millions of people can enjoy their favorite episodes of this great tv-show!"
4,Great Gift,My Dad was and still is an avid Seinfeld fan. I bought this for him at Christmas time for a gift and he was very pleased. Great for any fan of the show.
5,It s coming soon,"If you watch the beginning of 50 First Dates, they show add of Seinfeld on DVD. They will have a lot of extras on it and all they say it is being released soon. I have heard around the Christmas time frame."
5,Seinfeld - A MUST BUY on VHS or DVD,"If ever there was a show that should be released SEASON BY SEASON, SEINFELD is it!!!!What other show attracts 70 million viewers??and if it is released I guarantee 70 million people will buy it.This show would also be huge over here in UK as the BBC treated it like dirt.Release all 9 seasons now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Peerless PLA50UNLP,"Silver finish on product looks good. I don't believe the product is designed as well as it could be. It's difficult to rotate the arm in a horizontal plane when the TV is full extended away from the wall. Given the weight and cost of the product, I'm dissatisfied with its performance."
2,Didn't work for us,I bought this for my Mom's Cat who has a blocked tear duct. This didn't work as we had hoped.
3,Love the content but not the quality!,"Since I am a big Harry Potter Fan, I was very excited to get this product.The songs are very nice and I just love to play them. I also like how the booklooks like, especially the pictures of the movie that it has in it.I am not very satisfied with the quality though. The first time I opened it theglue at the back of the book started to come off although I was careful. The thinfoil the cover has on it also starts to come off already.Since it is the only way to get this really great sheet music, I still recommendgetting the book."
4,"James Webster, The New Grove Haydn","This is a concise, lucid, well written account of Haydn's life and career with a balanced assessment of his works and of his character. It contains a complete list of Haydn's works and a valuable bibliography for further reading and research. It is an excellent introduction to Haydn. Those wanting to learn more about Haydn's life and works will look elsewhere but will want this book for its listing of his works and its bibliography."
3,A Journey Of Personal Experience,Laurie's book helps people who are actively grieving to feel normal. It gives people permisssion to feel and draws them in as would a trusted friend and confidant. I know this by experience as I facilitate a grief support group and this has been their response.
4,Nice!,"Added much needed low end support for all those 5.25"" speakers in my Jeep Cherokee without taking up any cargo room."
3,IDENTICAL to A32!,"Felt ripped off, as this seems IDENTICAL to the A32 tip iGo sells for the Blackberry phone. Both use Mini-USB standard. NO NEED to carry both tips with you. And NO NEED to pay for TWO!Buy whichever is cheaper!"
1,"Caution, not the mini flat tip for the blackberry bold!!","F. I wish there was another review dealing with my blackberry. In fact, why the heck did blackberry/RIM change the shape of the tip!? I have useless tips and plugs everywhere, but only one adapter that I can actually use with this Bold. Actually, it's my company's fault for not allowing us to use our iphones and solving my final multi-gadget problem!"
5,it works on cat urine!,"We have a cat who had crystals in her urine and took to urinating on lots of different things, including our dirty clothes. The smell wouldn't come out of some of the clothes even after multiple washes in normal detergent so I bought this to try. I've done all of our laundry with it so that now the crystals are gone she won't smell the enzymes and continue to urinate on our dirty clothes. It's working great! I've been adding 1/3 cup of the solution to each load of laundry - without my normal detergent. At first I was just using the solution and the clothes smelled fine, but they were sort of... not as soft as I'm used to. So I've been using my Downy Ball and now they're perfect! I recommend this product to anyone with similar issues."
2,Pet stink remover,"Product didn't really work for me; it still smells :(. I used it on a futon but I don't think the product could get down into the fabric far enough. Not necessarily the products fault, but if you are going to use it on something with a lot of padding it may not be your panacea."
2,This didn't get out urine smell any more that any other shampoo,"For the amount I paid for the fluid ounces, I wouldn't bother. This doesn't get out urine smell more than any other carpet shampoo does. In fact the reason I wanted to try this was to get rid of urine smell, which still using vinegar/water/soap/peroxide (pick your combo) works better at doing anyhow. Just remember: NEVER use Ammonia to clean Carpets! haha"
4,Canon S35 Cartridge,"The cartrige installed easily and worked right away. However the printing is very light and can not be adjusted. This is OK for printed material, but maps and other graphic material are illegible."
3,Works well faxphone,"Works well in Faxphone L 170, like it is supposed to. But it is very expensive compared to after market brands. This were they get you when you buy a machine."
3,"Genuine cartridges are the only way to go, but they are silly expensive.","After having messed around with refill cartridges, it is clear that genuine toner is the only way to go. No more black powder messes, streaked documents, and empty cartridges after a few days.For what you get, HP toners are about half the price... so my review mostly criticizes the value."
2,CHARMS,BEAUTIFUL BRACELET WASN'T VERY STURDY. IT WAS A GIFT FOR MY 6YR OLD WHO DESTROYED IT IN 2WKS. CHARMS KEPT FALLING OFF.
3,not highly recommended,"First off, this is NOT a refracting telescope as the description says, it is a reflector (that is amazon's error, not meade's). Realize that with a reflector you must take care of your mirrors and keep them well collimated on a regular basis or your images will suffer. That's the downside of a reflector. My experience with this is that the autostar is very finnicky, right out of the box. I have owned 3 meade telescopes with the goto system and there has been problems in ALL 3 of them, including this one. The optics however are some of the best so... save your money and buy an instrument with larger aperture without the goto function...you'll be happy you did since finding your way around the sky with starmaps and a larger aperture to see the faint fuzzies is the best way to learn and you won't have to put up with the system failures that autostar gives you."
4,good and intersting,The book gives in what is truly a very short version of the French Revolution a succinct and witty account of the events. It also looks at a the long term: why it happened and how it effected French life. It is a very good introduction for a first year student or a nice way for the general reader to fill a very important gap in his/her education.
5,Great Little Read,"This was the most entertaining and informative, albeit short, description of the French Revolution. William Doyle did an excellent job- so much so that I am interested in reading some of his other offerings. :)"
3,Bad Math,"Coming from a math backgroung and trying to learn Actionscript, I have some serious reservations about the mathematical examples in this book. The authors seem to take the most convoluted longwinded routes to make thier points wherever math is involved, and thus cloud the point they are trying to make. Furthermore, they seem to use the old Flash 5 methodology for event handling instead of updating to the newer methodology that is more consistent with OOP. Otherwise, I am still reading this and some other Actionscript books looking for the right fit."
5,THIS GUY KNOWS HIS STUFF!!,"HOOORAY!! This book and all of Robert's books (and classes!!) are so valuable to any Flash Developer. Whether an artist and/or a coder, the reader will find the information to be clear, detailed and accurate. It's about time someone created such a great useful resource for us ""flashers""!! The examples and concepts covered are totally real-world applicable and help the reader conceptualize valuable building blocks of actionScript coding. Being primarily book and self taught one thing I really like is this book fills in the blanks... little details I never fully knew or understood. GREAT to keep on your desk for reference!!"
3,Lots of pieces,Bought this for a friend's 5yr old daughter. She needs help putting the pieces together. Great if your child loves puzzles.
