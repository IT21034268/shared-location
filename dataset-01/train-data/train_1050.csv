5,Fantastic!,Bought for a friend's birthday and she has not stopped thanking me for it. She loves the band and continues to be a Huge fan!
4,Brilliant,"There is something about this guy. The drugs...yeah, yeah, I know. Kate Moss...yeah, heard about her, too. The look? Doubt it. It's something else. His music just seems to work. It's raw, but catchy. It's rough, but delicate. It's real. And maybe that's just something that is hard to find in today's musical landscape."
5,"Nevermind the bullocks, here's the Babyshambles...","They just don't make rock stars like they used to. You know, the ones who'd get trashed, fight their own bandmates and do interviews completely coked out.Enter Pete Doherty, the former Libertines frontman made headlines for his nasty drug habit and the on again-off again relationship with Kate Moss. Doherty is the ultimate symbol of rock `n' roll excess.Fortunately for Doherty, things are looking up, his new band Babyshambles might just be the hottest thing in rock music right now. The band's debut effort, ""Down In Albion,"" mixes all the chaos and brass balls that made the Libertines so damn successful.Whether he's laid off the glass pipe or not remains to be seen. For now, we'll take Doherty the way he is, a bloody mess.- Bryan Maury"
4,DONT listen to Lewis Hingstons Review he's obviously a geek,"Yes you may have red that long analytical review of Lewis's and are put off buying this album. All i have to say is someone who writes about every aspect of every song is a wannabe journo who will never understand what babyshambles or the libertines are about. What he calls too many ""bum notes"" in the songs is part of what they stand for which is freedom with a song underneath. If you want to listen to perfect production f.uck off and listen to creed. But the rawness in the delivery is half the excitement, it sounds like they are playing in the room with you. And most importantly this album is full of interesting guitar work. Which geek boy Lewis wouldnt know about cause he has never been cool enough to play in a band the bitter little sod."
4,Shame the Libertines broke up,"There was so much energy presented in both Libertines albums.I only got a chance to listen to this album once and it usually takes me a few times to fully appreciate it, but all the songs were so slow, just no energy at all, no blazing guitars like the Libertines, no fast paced drum beats. All of those were evident best in the song ""The Saga"" on their self titled album."
2,Jesus!,"You people have no taste! Now, I love Peter as much as the next Libertines fan, but what's all this bollocks about 'freedom'? What is 'free' about drug addiction leading to, on average, poor music. Open your eyes: genius + heroin + crack cocaine = bad music. Now, OK, there are some good tracks, and occasionally glimpses of why we loved him. I for one refuse to give him money to buy drugs with, which, coupled with it being a mere shadow of Libertine glory, is why I will not be buying this album."
4,To the Edge of the World,"Mateo Macias de Avila must learn to survive on his own after his parents die of the plague in 1519. Fourteen year old Mateo can draw, read, sing and play a guitar. These talents help him once he is recruited as cabin boy, musician, and eventually ship artist on a voyage led by Magellan.I found this book suitable for older children and young adults. Though the reading level is 5th-8th grade, the material is often at an older level. I would lean towards grades 7-9 as the youngest readers for this book."
3,Makes my baby cry. Every. Single. Time.,"I bought this toy when my baby was about 6 months old thinking it would be a cute, fun, and unique puzzle. The problem is, playing the noises make her cry every single time. It never fails. Even now that she's 16 months, the sounds still make her cry. It's literally even gotten to the point where singing Old MacDonald to her makes her pout - this thing has ruined the song for her! Most of the time we keep the volume off and let her use it as just a puzzle, but the other problem is that she doesn't like puzzles. Oh well. When she was younger she enjoyed teething on the pieces at least."
1,Disappointment,This book really was a disappointment. The characters were weak and silly. If could not continue reading due to boredom.
1,Total trash,"I got this at the library as an audio book--10 discs. I quit at #4. What total trash this was, 3 discs of nothing but descriptions of sex acts. The premise that a 17 year old girl in the Victorian era would be taken to a brothel to ""educate"" her in the ways of the world is totally ludicrous to start with and it was just one sex act after another. I will never read anything by this author again. This was my first and last experience with her."
5,I Think everyone need's to judge for themselves,"Unlike our friend in Honolulu Hi, I have read everyone of Catherine Coulter's books. I can honestly say I have loved everyone of them. I have no idea what this person is talking about. Her stories are romantic yes, but they all hold a certain amount of excitment, intrigue, suspense and the out come is a very interesting book. I love the Bride series, as well as the Star and Song series. And most of all I would never judge a writer by one book. You might want to try her books that are more contemporary, like the Maze, the Edge, Etc."
2,"petty , ignorant heroine spoils book......","the other two reviewers have covered this books storyline so I just wanted to add my agreement on their reviews. The book's heroine-who is supposed to be a ""bluestocking"" or intelligent woman, ruins the story.What we have here is the reversal of the jerk hero, instead the heroine is one. Elizabeth is given a miracle opportunity of inheriting a fortune, but instead of behaving responsibly and intelligently, she wastes thousands on pounds on a revenge scheme against the hero's aunt. That was bad enough, but when she spends the entire book treating the hero-a perfectly nice guy-like a enemy just because of one offhand comment by said aunt, I just quit in disgust.The author does have some skill-I made it through three fouths of this book before I quit-so I will try another of her books. Though I wholeheartedly do NOT recommend this book.1.5 stars."
5,A Book Everyone Needs To Read,"This book is recomended for all ages. I think that this book teaches everyone a vauble lesson. Laughing and making fun of someone is not nice to do. but, some people do it anyway. It makes you think twice about your words and actions toward other people who are different than you. Nobody would like it if it happened to them. So i think that this is a great book that everyone needs to read. Everyone who does read this book will enjoy it a lot. So i hope you will read and enjoy this book Don't Laugh At Me!!!"
4,Don't Laugh at Me,"This book is an adaptation of a song which has become the anthem for Operation Respect, an educational program. The message of the book is that everyone is different and such differences should be respected. No one likes to be laughed at. This picture book is wonderful for teaching young children the values of respect and tolerance."
5,A must use in kindergarten on up!!!,I teach kindergarten and I am so happy I found this book and CD. It was recommended to me by my sister who is a school counselor. The many forms of bullying and making others feel bad about themselves is addressed in just a few wonderful words. The chorus is catchy and impossible to forget. My students (and their parents) were deeply moved by the illustrations of the book and the message the book conveyed. I have spoken to many of my colleagues who plan to use the book and CD in the higher grades as well.
4,Bully Book,The book helps children to understand the effects of poor decisions regarding friends. I use it in my third grade classroom. It opens discussion of feelings and behavior.
2,Not for Kindle,Putting sheet music like this on a Kindle is like putting a pin in a haystack. It's virtually impossible to read and use. Better to get it in real sheet music.
4,Model of GA Counties 1850 - 1885,"I read this book with great interest because my Clements Family, my 3rd & 2nd great grandfather and my Great Grandpa all lived in Greene County. I find this book very honest and revealing! I feel there are many such counties in Georgia that history are quite similar during the same period of time, 1850 -1885. I have read an older book published in 1930, ""The History of Wilkinson County"". I wonder why the point was made in that book the period 1840 to 1860 was the ""Golden Era of Wilkinson County."" The author explain that was due to the wealth of the county being the highest in history. After reading Jonathan M. Bryant book I understand. He explains the rise and fall of middle Georgia and why in great detail! It is an easy read if one does not get to bogged in the statistics. The author makes his main points well while the statistics documents the point being made. I highly reccomend this book."
4,Electronic Tango,Narcotango is a great CD...especially for slower paced Argentine Tango dancing. It is haunting and pulsating and allows one to dance in a creative and flowing way. At times the pieces kind of run together...lacking distinct individuality...but overall it is a great dance CD.
4,Close... but no cigar,"Worth having. Better than a lot of the dirge out there. It's a bit half-baked compared to Narcotango2 (a far superior album). In fact, it sounds a bit like a dry-run of Narcotango2. If you're new to the genre, go with Gotan."
4,Dixie Browning Romance,"(...)Okay, so maybe hiring a centerfold stud to remodel my home was crazy. But I, Marty Owens, practical bookstore owner, was a desperate woman, and contractor Cole Stevens was a man with muscles and strong hands and a seductive voice promising me he could get the job done fast. It made perfect sense for him to move in so he could work days and nights. But no logic can explain my wild fantasies about getting cozy with Cole in every room in the house - the bedroom, the shower, the kitchen.... Ladies, I'm in over my head with the man upstairs, but can I tempt him to repair his heart and build a home for us?Divas Who Dish - These three friends can dish it out, but can they take it?"
5,ok,"a fine way to learn french grammar through an interesting story, but you have to know some frenchit is a fine plot"
2,Sans intert,"I'm afraid that in spite of his (justified) distaste for the kind of deconstructionist, overanalytical grammarian like Mme Jargonos, Erika Orsenna has created a story that is almost as unlikeable in its own heavy-handedness. I was expecting to find a combination of depth and charm found in Le Petit Prince, whose author even makes a brief appearance in this story, but was disappointed by what just comes across as naive reflections about language. I would say that this book is more suited for kids, but at certain points throughout it is clear that Orsenna had adults in mind as well when writing it. But in the end it simply doesn't pan out."
1,La grammaire est une chanson DURE,"After i read this story, i did not find that I had truly received any messages from this novel. The plot was akward and there was no real point to the novel. I was dissapointed because I had heard such great things about this and it was terrible and i don't suggest you read the book becuase it does not achieve the potential that it has received from it's numerous positive articles. I don't know if you read the same book as me....."
5,Command in War,"Martin Van Creveld had chosen to use military history as the backbone to his thesis on Command and Conrol. The book not only deals with contemporary issues related to command, but traces the evolution of command and control alongside the development of warfare. This excellent analysis of specific battles is a good read for all who need to understand the fundamentals of command and control through storytelling."
5,Best book (I've read) on Command and Control,"Much has happened (e.g. Boyd's OODA methodology, etc) since this book was written, but I still think it's the best single book I'ved read on Command and Control. Much of what van Creveld talks about historically is supported by Boyd's OODA theory and similar models of decision-making.Highly recommended, and one of those books I've bought and given to others...dave"
3,Read if concerned for the evolution of command systems.,"Martin Van Creveld writes a thought provoking work which provides the framework for a critical analysis of command systems. This historical study of command provides insight into the evolution of modern problems, and suggests potential solutions for the inquisitive mind. Not just for the military professional, business professionals benefit from his suggestions on ""rightsizing"" and reorganization."
4,Decent Trainer,"Decent , portable Trainer, make sure u know the weight that your fingers can handle, overdoing it would just be disasterous"
4,Grip master,"This product does what it was designed for, works your individual hand at your own pace."
3,"Improvement in finger strength, but few problems","I bought this to help with parkour and other action sports, and I felt the improvement early on. The device itself, though, didn't last as long. The buttons started twisting the wrong way and the black wax grip kept falling off in my pocket. And my finger joints haven't felt the same after a few tries with it; maybe I'm doing something wrong, or you're not supposed to use it for prolonged sessions."
5,Great Product,Wow! This product is a great help to any person who plays a string instrument. I have used this many time to strengthen my fingers for guitar and bass playing. This is also a great way to calm yourself before a concert. I was very impressed with this product.
5,good little device,This is the tension that is best for most children and smaller adults. The grip is a little smaller than the old dyna-grip model that I used to have. This also makes a great fidget for sensory diets.
5,Surprisingly Good Quality,"For $10, I'm quite surprised at the build quality, which is very good. Nice rubber grip, smooth operation, no sideways motion of the plungers. I would expect it to last for quite a few cycles, though only time will tell. FYI, I'm 6'2"", 200lbs, don't work out, and 9 lbs seems light."
5,So good,This product really strengthened my fingers. I play the guitar and need strong finger to press on the strings to make beautiful sounds. Because of this grip i feel that my music abilities has been enhanced.
5,Top Notch,The Gripmaster is the perfect unit for hand and arm muscle exercise. Recently having surgery on my shoulder my physical therapist had me using one for weeks. After my time in PT I missed using it and order one for myself. The red one or medium tension allows for both the husband and wife to use the unit. Just sitting it close to the TV remote allows me or my wife to pick it up and start using it 3 or 4 times each week without thinking much about it. You will even start using it while walking around the house. It is amazing how your grip and hand strength will improve within a month. There are copy cats out there but Gripmaster is proven and used by professional clinics everywhere. It is worth the order and 5 stars.
5,Good Stuff,"I got the 7 pound (red) and 9 pound (black) gripmasters. They are good quality for the price, and they don't squeek, though, my red one has begun to click slightly. They are pretty useful grippers for finger strength, though I probably should have purchased a 11 pound or more model. I use these for general finger strength, and, as an artist, I find them useful for exercising a steady hand."
4,Very good and practical,I found the Gripmaster practical and very useful as advertised. I recommend the Gripmaster to anyone.
3,"Gimmick, buy the toughest tension you can and it probably still won't be tough enough.","Honestly. I just let 3 common females close the ""HEAVY TENSION"" and they did it easy, my 40+ year old mom can close it multiple times no problem and she is about below average strength, IT IS WAY TOO EASY, BUY THE TOUGHEST ONE FIRST IF YOU WANT ONE. I did have a long review wrote but its deleted since i got 3 non-exercising people, that is a girl and 2 old women to close it easily multiple times. Also its made of ""TOO MUCH PLASTIC"", although i am surprised that it did not fall apart, still i think it would be good for building endurance, so its a 6 out of 10, they tried, and i think they pretty much failed. I think ""Captains of Crush"" would be better for brute force strength, but i have not tried one yet."
5,Love It!,I bought the red/medium tension and it's a good beginner challenge for most. It looks like a little instrument of torturebut I love it. I am a 50 something woman who is an advanced-beginner guitar player and it's helping tremendously plus there is something about having hand and finger strength that makes all your everyday chores easier such as typing this recommendation. Also great for stress.
5,Great product,"I play guitar and always use these little guys to strenghten my forearms, hands, and wrist. DEFINITELY SUGGEST TO ALL"
3,soso,just so so. would be nice if not so uncomfortable on the fingers at the edge. but they do the job
5,Just out of rehab,I needed this to get my strength back in my left hand after surgery. It seems to be well made and I am almost where I need to be after just a few weeks
5,Works great and great results.,This product does the job. Have seen good results within days.The wife needed to gain hand strength to handle pistols.
3,Not very hard,"It works, but it doesn't produce the desired resistance. Not that it is super weak, just not as beneficial as one would hope."
2,Not cool,Get the heaviest one. I'm a scrawny kid and this was way too easy. I'm not struggling at all. meh
5,Get awesomely strong fingers!,"I bought this because I wanted to improve my typing speed, and it definitely works wonders. Both my speed and accuracy have improved, and I credit it to this hand grip. I use it everyday for about 15 minutes, and do high reps (200-300) as recommended. It comes with a little booklet of the different exercises you can do, and the Gripmaster website has training programs depending on your intention.My only real regret is that I bought the black heavy tension grip instead of the red medium tension grip, as I did find it difficult to close at first. Also, I wasn't able to crack my knuckles before but now I am, which is slightly worrying, and I now have calluses on my finger tips.Pros:-Works well-High build qualityCons:-Puts strain on joints-It's only really for athletes and professionals. Get the medium tension grip instead."
5,Great Hand Strength Developer,"I love this thing. It is small, and can fit in my pockets. I take it everywhere with me, and have been using it to strengthen my left hand as I use it less than my right. I have noticed a significant increase in the strength of my left hand as well as the increase in utilization of this hand as I increase its strength. Great for those people who do a lot of typing and computer related work as well."
4,Well made and useful,Nice hand exerciser for when I'm at my computer. I really like this as it allows me to pinpoint the truly weak fingers...you can see this when you squeeze it and see which finger(s) do/don't go down as far as the others (when you squeeze it naturally without thinking).
5,Good product,Beats the hell out of the hand strengtheners that you squeeze the handle and that's all. I am a guitarist and have used these for years to help sustain endurance. I guess there isn't that much else to say. It is what it is.
3,Good but miss leading title,"This product is great for the price. It's small, portable, and simple to use. It would have been nicer if there was a coating of rubber on the finger pieces for comfort. Be careful on the difficulty level though. I'm pretty fit so I figured Heavy tension would work well but it isn't very difficult. I know this may have just been my case but when I read ""Heavy Tension"" I expected a challenge. Nice product though."
5,Great strength builder....,Great strength builder....These are great while seating at a desk....builds strength and they make great stocking stuffers for men!~Inexpensive and worth every penny!~
5,Perfect for building guitar strength and coordination,"I have owned this product for about a week now, and it has basically become an extension of my body. I use it while walking, in lecture, while reading, everywhere. Not only is it fun to play around with, but I have noticed a significant improvement in my guitar skill. Not only do I strengthen my fingers on the go, but it is a great way to practice your coordination. I have been playing guitar for 6 years- I wish I had been using this product since the beginning. The key, I feel, is to get a lower tension (I got the light one, and I have a pretty strong grip) so that you build endurance and agility. Moreover, all this practice has given me more confidence on my axe. I highly recommend this product."
3,Too little resistance,This is well constructed and works well for strengthening individual fingers but if you've trained trip at all will be too low of a resistance.I've moved on to the captains of crush #1 gripper.
3,"Good for ""casual"" users.","My Gripmaster is about 4 or 5 months old and, at first, I liked it a lot. I use it all the time, especially in the car, and I think that this extensive use is the problem. It's starting to fall apart bit by bit. If you're hyper-active you might consider a simple racquet or tennis ball because these things (I bought a medium and heavy gripper) don't seem to stand up very well. The design is excellent but the quality, especially around the springs, leaves a lot to be desired. Sorry, I really wanted these things to last."
2,Light means extremely light,"Well made - but extremely light. May be good for physical therapy or a child, not for an adult. I bought all three and even the haviest is pretty light."
2,Light...,"I bought all three and they should be labled Light, Lighter and Lightest.Good for physical therapy, women or children.well made."
3,Not impressed - I prefer the regular wrist press,I decided to try this out since I was used to the 'wrist press' that you get for under $5 (btw - i also used the wrist press for my finger exercises). The gripmaster turned out to be nothing fancy and not as good as the regular wrist press. Initially - I thought is was because I got the 'medium' gripmaster - so like a fool - I ordered the 'heavy' one. It was no better- basically - I was unable to find anything revolutionary or new about the gripmaster that benefitted me. Back to the regular wrist presses - for my fingers and my wrists!
3,the hell did i buy,"i dont know why i bought this, for crazy huge forearms?! rarrrr!!! lol idk if this is really going to work well for you, i guess its a fine product."
1,Not comfortable at all on the fingers,"The grip master is comfortable on the palm of the hand, but not on the fingers or finger tips. The press downs are hard plastic and after a while your fingers are going to start to hurt if you dont have fat cushiony fingers, my fingers are hurting days after my first set. And no its not because I don't have the strength to do it, I have no problems pressing them down its just that they are not comfortable, they should've made the finger press downs the same as the palm grip, RUBBER!!! not hard plastic."
2,Not the same Gripmaster you might expect,"I have a Gripmaster that I bought probably 6 years ago, and it's solid and the movement is very smooth. I bought one of these new versions of the Gripmaster and it absolutely blows.First, the name/graphics label is not what is pictured. It says ""prohands.net"". Nice, sounds like a top-tier company [/sarcasm].Second, the action is not smooth at all. The springs between the palm and middle section stick constantly.I don't get how there are a bunch of different products called the ""Gripmaster"" and they are all slightly different versions of the same thing. I need to find the company that is making the version of the Gripmaster that is like my older one, because this new one sucks and is going back to Amazon."
2,Well made but too small,"This would be good for a child or a person with petite hands, but for my full-size man hand I could only get three fingers on it. If it were larger it would be just fine"
3,Gets the job done,"It's an ok hand exerciser. I bought it primarily to help with my guitar playing. It didnt make me a guitar god in 2 days but it did help me control my fingers a little bit more. I also use it if im headed somewhere and I need a quick warm-up before getting to a guitar. If you're a musican and you want to improve your finger strength, then this could help you. But don't expect to be a virtuoso over night.My second reason for the purchase was to help with my hand writting. I didn't see any improvement.But before you even give one squeeze, I suggest you READ THE MANUAL. And look at the grip master website for proper instructions. I keep hearing about people who say they royaly screwed up their wrist from this thing. When ever people ask to see it for a sec, they wrap their whole hand around it and squeeze it fast every second. This is not the proper way to handle this thing. You're not getting any work from it. You'd just be wasting your time."
4,Pretty nice,"If you want a stronger grip, this is your tool.I suggest buyers to go straight for the heavy tension ones; It may feel very heavy at first but you get used to it. If you get the light tension ones then you may think it's too easy, with the heavy ones you get more strength for your money.**The index finger and pinky finger will be the hardest to train so don't worry if you can't get it down."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I have mixed feelings about this product, I do not have big hands, but I find it too small/thin, which makes it uncomfortable, in addition, I think it breaks in too quick, I bought the black/heavy tension, first day it was great, hard to do 30-40 rep sets, by the third day, I could handle it without problems, I doubt I got strong so quick, it takes a few days, not literally 2 days!In any case, that is why I am not giving it a low or high rating, just in the middle, i recon it does somehow helps in strengthening your fingers and forearm."
4,Good stuff.,"Good item. Very well built. Feels solid. My only complaint is that on the pinky, it sits odd and digs in when you are squeezing. On the other fingers it sits on the meaty part between the knuckle bend and does not bother me. I don't know how they could design it so that the pinky squeezer sits off center so that you don't have this problem but this is why it gets 4 stars. Besides that, I definitely feel it working my forearms. I keep it in my car and it gives me a little something to do while driving."
3,Alright but a bit small.,"its a good product but i think its a bit small, I'm 17 yrs old and i have a hard time pressing it down cuz its small not because its hard."
4,Great for strengthening fingers,"I am a adult beginner learning the cello, and I must say that, this has been a great tool to carry in my handbag. I have used this coupled with the callus builder attachment. As I cannot carry the cello wherever I go, this enables me to strengthen my fingers on the go while travelling on public transport. This is turn makes my practice sessions on the cello are more efficient, as I focus more on the notes not trying to press down the string with all my might."
4,very good.,it is a very good product.In my free time i use this product for work pauses and it is very good for my fingers.
5,Good stress ball...,The normal stress balls just dont cut it. I use this as my stress ball and its great. Been stressed and squeezing it plenty and its holding up.NICE!! get it for you stress ball use.
1,Why does the link for the blue version (light tension) keep taking me to the black one?,"I am trying to purchase the light tension (5 lbs per finger) version of this product which comes in blue. However, the link keeps bringing up the black (heavy) version. Could your webmaster please fix this? Thank you."
5,Well designed and good price,"As others have reviewed, these prohands grippers are very good. I bought the heavy tension one after some deliberating and it is just right (decent for full grasp and tough on the individual finger exercises).Be sure to try out the various exercises in the booklet."
3,Not sure yet,I think it would work if I used it on a daily basis but it is still awkward for me. I would recommend buying two levels at the same time to be able to move up in difficulty. I do wish it came with some exersize recommendations.
1,Price went down immediately and an ok product,"The price went down more than two dollars as soon as next day of delivery. The product is well made, but I expected the tension to be stronger on this. Not worth the money for me at least."
1,better to have bought an exercise ball,"save your hard earned money and buy an exercise ball made for your hands, this item is over priced, and doesn't really work well. waste of money."
1,Buy it from Guitar Center Instead.,The black(Grey) padded hand portion is anemic on this model If you buy the Gripmaster from Guitar Center theirs is much more padded and easier to grip comfortably.
1,This item is a fail.,"I bought this hoping that it would increase my hand strength for palming a basketball and guitar. This thing hurts; not my fingers nor wrist, but my palm. It is a pretty bad pain and I got the thing in the mail less then 5 min ago. I have been squeezing it for about 3 min, and don't feel anything. It is also SO small that my fingers keep slipping off, which hurts also. This is a fail of an item. The only way I can use it is by putting my whole hand over the thing and squeezing it. Good idea, but I'm gonna return it and get the classing squeeze thing."
5,great stress relief,"I use it primarily when I'm on the road. If I travel abroad, I carry it in my laptop bag and use it on the plane and in the cars. I'm a control freak and it takes my mind off of not being the one driving or flying.Gives my hand a great work out. Strengthened my grip and fingers."
4,Good product,"They forgot to add one VERY important use of these things, and that's why these bad boys usually sell well. What would that be? Well, guitar(mainly for faster guitarists). So why? Well, so you can hit the frets harder, faster, and more accurately, which does sound better than normal.Anyway, this thing really does build quite a bit of muscle believe it or not.Now someone mentioned that their palm got sore, got mad about that, and gave it 1 star. Odds are that person will like it in a couple weeks. Them saying that means that they just got it. And yes, your palm does get sore a tiny bit, but yes, this also works the forearm... and quite well for that matter."
3,Medium?,"It's ok. Perhaps my fingers are a little stronger than I thought, as the Medium tension is pretty easy.it's a good product, well constructed and got here quick. If you're on the fence though, choose the higher tension."
3,Nice but...,"I'm a pretty big guy and normally wear xl in most brands but when i got my t- shirt i was kinda disappointed seeing that it fitted bigger than i wanted it to, almost a xxl but apart from that the quality and color was just what i wanted and expected."
4,Great book to read on a winter's night.,"Very facinating book...I really enjoy reading it during the winter time when it's snowy outside. I've learned a lot of things from this book,some what to do and some what NOT to do's. I met the author and enjoyed his presentation during the 30th anniversary a few years ago."
2,Only for the simple minded,"I hate to be so harsh in this review, but it is semi-obvious that the others who have written for this book are friends of the writer. If you have even the most basic experience, this book is not for you. If you have no background in the music biz what so ever, this books basic coverage of the topic might be for you. Why? It's like a McDonald's burger - WHERE'S THE BEEF?? She never touches on the important decision making processes or on the legalities of setting up a label (such as taxes, contracts, royalties, etc.). Skip this if you already have a clue, get it if you don't."
3,Not for experienced industry types,"This is a good primer for those with little to no experience of the music industry who are looking to get in or those looking for a basic reference guide. If you've spent any significant time in the industry already doing a marketing, promotion or A&R types jobs at a major or major independent label, this book offers very little new for you."
1,a beginners book,"if I see or hear the word D.J again IM going to blow up, IM kinda pissed, I wanted to know how much you get in radio royalties, and how much I can get for my products from distributors on an average or certain forinstances. This book is for a real beginner person who only knows how to press play on their CD player. I wanted to know more about copyrights and publishing, i wanted to hear someone's exact deals, kinda layman's sketch, not a pipe dreamers sketch, i dot think i really got a lot from this book, i hope i can find a better one some wareShawn"
3,helpful....,"I found this book to be a great deal of help in starting your label. It gives a lot of things people need to be aware of, as well as additional advice from individuals associated in the music industry. A lot of the book, however, covers areas that are just common sense, and at times I find Daylle's advice to not be in agreement with my own opinions. In fact, at certain points of the book I get the urge to find this woman and give her a good smacking."
4,Helpful Book...,"This was an informative book. The internet section was outdated. I'm going to get more material to read reguarding starting up a record label that's more current,but overall, this was a very helpful book."
4,A classic,This is one of the first books i actually read from cover to cover on the music industry. It was a great buy along with a couple of manuals I purchased from Musicbrains.net entitled the Indie label Kit.
3,Pretty good...,"I read it and would love to start my own label, but unfortunately, I won't be doing it anytime soon. Good advice, though."
3,Too many direct citations in the text makes difficult to read,"I could blame the author for two major things:1) inserting the huge citations from other people in each and very paragraph in the whole book! It makes the whole text very difficult to follow, why not to write the digested and formatted text and add references somewhere? It's clear, professional and how it must be. Especially, as the author claims herself ex-profession as teacher. And it's her ....th book/edition.2)she points out the your site should be well-done, you has to be easy-found on the internet, etc. But! Herself she is not using her own advices: it's impossible to find her record label, her production company site looks egm..., her own author site looks clumsy as well. Maybe I'm too critical, but in my opinion when you arrive to the dentist and see his rotten teeth he wont inhale confidence in you...Still, nothing venture nothing gain and I respect the author's step in show biz as I'm a woman and record label owner too."
2,Is this lady even in the music business?,"The other books she has written are about women and relationships. Nice for dealing with your girlfriend, but I want to sell records. Pass on this one."
2,Written like a book for children,"People who are interested in starting a record label would benefit from a book that presents them with many facts, details and intricacies about the music industry, the legal system as it pertains to music, etc.. This book is not it. The author does not interpret complex ideas, but makes subjective statements according to how things ""feel"" to her. While she touts being informed about the labyrinths of business as a great virtue, she wastes most of her time waxing inane about how one can ""do it!"" with the right attitude. Yes, there were some scattered facts about how to file for a business license and trademark a name, but nothing beyond what a simple internet search can provide. It reads too much like an elementary school book you would read when doing a report on what you want to be when you grow up."
2,A Leftist's View of the Molly Maguires,"Anthony Bimba's leftist political ideology takes precedence over historical accuracy in this ostensibly non-fiction account of the Molly Maguires. Mr. Bimba, a Lithuanian immigrant who wrote propaganda for the American Communist Party in the 1930s and 40s, used the Molly Maguire story as an opportunity to demonize capitalism and make heroes out of outlaw coal miners, many of whom were convicted of violent crimes and murders in the Pennsylvania coal fields in the 1870s. Ever eager to excuse the Molly Maguires' crimes, Bimba ignored much historical evidence of guilt and tried to justify the Mollies' criminality as a just cause in the struggle of labor. Today, Mr. Bimba's version of those events comes across as hopelessly biased and outdated. Other accounts both old and recent, such as the work of Dewees, Coleman, Broehl and Kenny, are less biased and more informative."
1,Whitewashing the Terrorists,"This book presents the Molly Maguires in a left-wing fairy tale. You won't often see such biased, one-sided fantasy passing itself off as history. This book perpetuates the myth that the Molly Maguire terror squad were just well-meaning choir boys trying to build support for a union. Somehow, in Bimba's version, all the murders and mayhem get left out.This book was written over 75 years ago when the anarchists and Communists still thought they had a chance to get a foot in the door through American labor unions. Times have changed and this kind of propaganda doesn't work any more. It's time to put this book out of its misery and let it go out of print."
5,Best ice tea!,This tea makes the best refreshing ice tea! My wife puts 4 bags of Constant Comment and 4 bags of regular orange pekoe in my ice tea pot. I beg her to make a pitcher for me daily!
4,Lovely,The earrings were absolutely lovely. Casual and elegant. I would recommend these to anyone. :)
5,Great Gift,"I had added these to my wishlist and forgotten about them when I received them as a gift. They are beautiful and came in a small bag tucked inside of a small box. It was a great presentation for a gift. I love wearing these with all types of outfits. They aren't too dressy to wear with jeans or to casual to wear to a formal event. I love the versatility of these earrings. The only thing that gets a little annoying is that the chain that dangles in the middle sometimes get wrapped around the larger swirly part. It doesn't hurt the earrings, but just looks a little silly if you don't fix it. I still give them 5 stars!"
2,kls2010,"I was a little disappointed as the picture showed a very dainty elegant earring but when I receive it, it did not look either elegant or dainty. The wires are very very thin and the chain with the ball is quite longer than shown which just makes it look less attractive.The balls have a tendency to get tangled in the wires with normal movement. I kept them but I wasn't thrilled with them. Haven't gotten any comments either."
4,Very good product!,Earrings look really pretty! The design is so unique! They would have been perfect if they were just a little bigger.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,Horrible!! These earrings are cheaply make & were broken when they arrived. The only correspondence I recieved with the earrings was a small receipt with an email address to email if you have problems. I emailed the company twice and never heard back. I ended up just throwing the earrings out and wasting my money.
2,Fooled Me,"I have to say I was very dissapointed in these earings. They are very pretty, however the hook of the earing is so cheap whatever comes in contact with it will bend it. It seems to be such a soft material that it Cannot hold its shape. The earings are useless to me now. I can""t even try to get them back into shape, thats how bad they are misshaped."
3,too dainty,"I really liked the earrings, but they are too dainty. The chain with the ball constantly gets tangled in the rest of the earring. Right now, they are knotted and I can't get them untied....."
2,Broke before I got to wear them.,"Beautiful, but way too dainty and fragile. One of them broke when I took it out of the packaging and I never got to wear these earrings."
3,so nice and okay,"I was disappointed by its size but are very beautiful and different ... The explanation of this article is poor and inadequate, its price is very good and excellent quality. I recommend it for a gift for people of taste subtle and delicate"
3,Richard Vission lets fans down with his Hilary mixes,"For Hilary's first huge Billboard Dance Chart club hit, the remixer of choice was electro house master Richard Vission, so I waited with baited breath to hear his remix--only to find that he basically created a DUB version that uses just the line ""do it with love"". His mix could have been SO hot if he had bothered to make a full vocal remix, but you don't get that here. This is about 6 minutes of awesome bassline with barely any vocal.His remix of ""Play With Fire"" is the EDIT, and it is pretty much a letdown as well, not at all a standout Vission mix. I expected so much more from this single."
2,A good attempt but not quite on the mark,"As an ex-mormon whose excommunication ended a marriage but began a new life, I agree with many of Judy's story lines. I believe her story to be fascinating and true in most aspects based on my own experiences. I thought however, that hr story was somewhat embellished with dramatizations to make the book seem more interesting, to sell more books and sell her lectures (that she gives around the country). I think anyone interested in Mormonism should read the BOM and contact Lighthouse Ministry which is anti moromon in text and make your own decision."
4,Finally... biography of the best tenor saxophonist,Great story of his life and his music. Appropriate title indeed of the best tenor sax ballad players ever. His Chelsea Bridge and Time After Time songs are greatest if you want to hear the Breathy Sound Ben Webster can make. Long live his legend!
2,The Artist's Way Morning Pages Journal,"The main disappointment was that 6 pages were ripped out from the front of the book. Although the rest of the book was intact, it was not what I expected."
1,This is a buyer only knows,I hated it. I know people who loved it though. I live a life where I wake up and exercise. I don't have 2 hours to wake right up and sit down and write. That would be hard with my being a mom of 3. I would have loved it if the author could understand the plight of the night owl. In the book she hammers it in though that you won't be doing the book right if you can't commit to the morning hours. I found myself putting it in the garage to get it out of my way because I never had the time to get into it and couldn't get into it. I bought the book and cassettes too... if you are not a morning person ... maybe just check out the regular book from the library and see how you feel. I really do firmly stand on some love some hate it's a book that only you will be able to know for sure if you would like it.
1,waste of time,"Either you write or you don't. There is no book that can tell you how to do it or unleash something that is inside you. I like the idea that anyone can write and I highly suggest everyone do it. But I can surmise the entire book in a few words and save you the religious babble. If you want to write or think you can write, then do it. Eventually you WILL get better, or you will turn to something else. If you think you can write then start writing and prove everyone else wrong. You don't need to spend the money to learn that if you want to write, than the best recourse is to write. No one is fooled into to thinking the first thing they write is good. It takes practice. And this is one of two things this book preaches. The other is religion, mostly Christianity."
2,Frustrating to write in!,"I have nothing against the idea of this journal, it's just frustrating to work with. As another reviewer mentioned, spiral-bound would have been a lot nicer. It is extremely difficult to write in due to the thickness and the binding. I am also left handed which never helps when trying to write in books. Instead, I bought myself a notebook that I love. It's much more pleasant to write in the morning, now. I'd save your money for something else that you would like."
5,Excellent program,"I do the Artist Way program every summer. It is a 12 week course that helps one get in touch with one's passion. I completely use the book and this year, I treated myself to the journal."
3,Morning Pages Journal,"The ""How to"" of Morning Pages, divided into 12 weekly sections and thoughtfully filled with exerpts from ""The Artist's Way."" The Artist is offered the perfect format for writing the Morning Pages at the beginning of their journey to recovery. Large pages, generously spaced lines and ""right on"" spiritual support for healing the artist child within."
4,Fun facts,Cute way to show children that penguin differ just as do people. Many adults could learn from this book. I will share with the children in my life.
2,Product review,"This book did not even ship with a book cover. I am a teacher and one of some of the things we review is the front cover, back over, author and illustrator. I was unable to do that with this book as the shipper did not even mail the book slip over with the book."
5,Binary Revolution,"Really gave me a better understanding and appreciation of computers. I was trapped from the beginning to the end. Product was ++++++++, reasonable and arrived on time!!!"
2,Grandma necklace,"Beautiful piece, had to search for it in the box, it did not appear to even be there. Wife wore it all of 12 days before the ring that attaches the pendant to the chain opened up and pendant fell off. If all you are going to do is look at it then it is worth the price, if the intention was to actually wear it, then put a safety chain around it too."
3,Janis is consistently good!!!,"Good cd. I love ""Joy"", my daughter is getting married and I think it would be perfect song to play at the wedding. I wish there were more songs like it on the cd. I've never been a fan of her ""folky"" songs. I miss the songs styles she had on ""Between the Lines"", ""Aftertones"" and ""Janis Ian"".There are some very dated lyrics on ""Danger,Danger"", I think she could have come up with better lyrics.This was my first purchase from Amazon.com. I don't think I'll ever buy a cd at a store again. I love the sound bites."
3,nice cd,I heard some of the songs played on Sirius. I bought the cd off her website. Some nice songs. Glad she's moved away from the chick songs.
3,all the same,"This book is alright. I did enjoy reading it somewhat even though the stories all seemed to be the same after a while. Although it paints a clear picture of Japanese-Americna struggles, most stories end with the predictable outcome. I did not like the ending of most of the stories. Furthermore, I am unhappy with the skewing of the plays ""And the Soul Shall Dance"" and ""The Music Lesson"" by the short stories similar to them. ""Shirley Temple Hotcha-cha"" is the best story in the book, offering a different end for Japanese-American women."
5,Awesome Ending to an Awesome Series!,I love Dragon Ball Z and definitely think that this is a must have for all Dragon Ball Z fans. The last season is much more exciting than previous ones and there is also less fluff. The story line can be confusing at times for first time viewers but I don't think that even that is discouraging.
2,missing booklet,Yes the show is awesome and I bought this set brand new but the booklet was missing. I do recommend the dvd set to all dragon ball z and anime lovers but be careful because you might not get the booklet.
5,Love dragon Ball Z!,"I'm a DBZ fanatic and these DVD sets make for the ultimate collection of the show. I have all 9 now and I would absolutely recommend them all to any avid DBZ fan. The video and audio quality are both excellent and, despite some ridiculous complaints, I love the new up scaled wide screen format. 5 Stars!"
5,It's Dragonball...,"The Marathon Feature almost eliminates the old argument of DBZ dragging on too long with nothing happening by eliminating the OP/ED and recaps. Scenes and dialogue are uncut with original Japanese audio. As with all anime purists, I cannot recommend the English audio in any scenario."
1,Missing item in the package,"We ordered Dragon Ball Z: Season Nine (Majin Buu Saga. We received the DVD in the package, There is supposoed to be a ""24_page Booklet with Episode Summaries and Character Descriptions"" shipped with DVD. However, the booklet was missing in the package. We are dissappointed with this situation. I request the booklet will be delivered to me soon and I would be informed how this happened."
1,Missing disc,I unwrapped season nine today and disc four wasn't in there. I bought the whole series as a gift and am extremely unhappy.
2,No episode guide,"Yes, I would like to inform that I got the DVD in time, but I have to say that once I opened the package I noticed that the DVD box didnt have the same plastic cover as the others, (which I found kinda weird)and it came to my surprise that the booklet or episode guide as you may call it was not found inside my DVD box. Who can I contact for this problem, I would like to have the episode guide if its not too much trouble. Im rating only 2 stars because of this, a reply would be most gladly aprecciated"
5,First fusion,This season was great too because you got to see thesayians at their full power with vegeta and goku fusiontrunks and goten fusion was good too. All z fightersplayed a part in beating buu and you also got to seevegeta finally admit goku is the best which was cool
5,"The ""Plain Speaking"" Edda","I facilitate a monthly bookclub where we compare various translations, stanza by stanza, of the Poetic Edda. The point is to notice the differences in translation and discuss what they might mean in order to more completely understand the verse.THIS is the book I refer to when I want to be sure what the heck a particular verse REALLY means! If I am confused or want to double-check that I've properly understood something, it's where I turn.When someone asks me which translation I would reccomend to beginning lore scholars, I usually suggest this one, because it is easy to understand. It might sacrifice flowery language, or not make the attempt to re-create the poetic rhythym of the original Old Norse that other translations do, but it is uncompromisingly direct.(I call it the ""No Bull"" translation.)"
2,Not what I expected,"This translation was not what I expected. I have read the Elder/Poetic Edda before, but the copy I had previously was electronic. I bought this translation so I could have a hard copy that was a new translation. What I wish I had known was the translator edited her translation based on what she thinks was added by Christian monks who transcribed the Edda. I have spent quite a bit of time studying the conversion of the Scandinavian people to Christianity and I know that was a problem, but I still would have liked to see it in its entirety and been able to judge for myself what was added and not added. I am currently looking for a better translation to add to my collection."
2,Boring...,This is sort of an idiot's eye view of the 6 Sigma process. I think it might be useful if you are trying to sell a six sigma program within your organization and your co-workers are like the characters featured in the Dilbert comic strip by Scott Adams. Especially the pointy haired boss.There are better resources to use in understanding the value of six sigma.
3,The big DUH,"This book is good enough at what it sets out to do, which is to define the major concepts and terms used by members of the Cult of Six Sigma. Spoiler alert: Six Sigma is process improvement using logic and data. (Well, duh!) Now you can save yourself nine bucks."
3,The Title Says It All,"While not the sort of book you want to spend an evening with, it is the sort of book for one to read, if one wants to help their company or organization stand above the competition. It takes the whole notion of quality in puts it in solid terms that can be analyzed.In perhaps the most simple to understand terms, the authors take the reader through the entire Six Sigma process and explain how the application of Six Sigma can improve the bottom line of a company as well as improve the performance of individuals in a company....with out leaving too much pizza sauce on you. Read the book to find out.All pizza sauce aside, there are several good examples through out the book about how service oriented businesses can and did apply Six Sigma, thus debunking the notion that Six Sigma is just for businesses that manufacture items."
4,Good basic introduction,We have used this book as a good basic introduction to Six Sigma.It doe a good job in vocabulary and fundamental concepts. We give this book to all employees starting six sigma or hike training programs.
5,This book is a classic,"For two recipes alone you need the book. The Baklava w/the extra almonds and the feta dressing which is outstanding. Most of the recipes I haven't used, the ones I have have come out very well."
5,Great Book,Great book and hard to find. Maybe out of print but it has all the old fashion authentic Greek food receipes.
5,As close as it gets,"As a non Greek married to a Greek, I received this book from my husband in 1971. He marked all the dishes that his mother cooked and I started to try to prepare them. Throughout the years I have used the book as guide and the compliments from my mother in law and Greek friends have been wonderful.I have tried other books however I keep coming back to this one. I have been told that I cook Greek food better than most Greeks. I purchased this book for my daughter and now she has become an excellent cook of Greek foods. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn to cook like a real Greek cook."
4,Loved it!,"Good read .. Kellen and her friend Lee are the like the friends we all want to have,if only to live vicariously through them. They are not twenty somethings either..they are mature women.. and smart ones. Kellen trained to be a doctor, chose another path.Once upon a time she lived on a lovely horse farm with her partner Bridget. Then bad decisionson Kellen's part ended that. But the love never ended.This is a murder mystery and most of the important parts are played by good, strong and lovingwomen. The inspector is a treat, I like him. I especially liked him when he showed up with Tir, anotherstrong smart female. Some might call her a b*tch, but she wouldn't mind that a bit.How satisfying to be the one to look for the one who did harm to loved ones.The ending came too quickly. A worthy read. A series of course. I look forward tobook #2. It is no Three Pines, but I sure wouldn't mind visiting..."
1,"Dire, turgid nonsense","Three years ago I had my wallet stolen in Las Vegas and had to drive my van into the desert to wait three weeks for new cards to come through from New York. After getting food and water I had only enough cash to buy one book. I took two hours to choose, and settled on Hen's Teeth because it was set in England and I thought I might get through the ordeal thinking of home. I have never made a worse decision in my life. An appalling, two-dimensional crawl through the most laughably implausible situations and the most idiotic stock characters (complete with dashing copper, mad scientist and wilting-flower lesbos). It made a difficult time for me incalculably worse. I will hold this 'book' in contempt forever."
5,great assortment at a good price,Great collections of classics with good recording quality. Good bargain. This is a good set of her best.I usually have at least a few I end up skipping over or leaving out of the playlist for an album. At most there is one on here I skip over sometimes.
4,Good memories!,I had forgotten just how good her voice is. This album brings back so many good memories. A very good deal!
3,Not the original mixes?,"These are great songs, but not the original radio mixes that I expected. What happened to the orchestral background harmonies? It seems to be all vocal and rhythm track/booming bass. I suppose some might enjoy that, but it feels like the music's half missing."
4,Good album but,"It's a great album that covers alot of ground, but where is ""God Don't Like Ugly""?? I think the makers of this album (and the previous ""Best Of"" album as well) sold Ms. Flack's work kind of shortI would still recommend getting this though."
3,Nicely remastered but could use more early material,"Really unfortunate that ""Jesse"", ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow"", and ""You've Got a Friend"" are left off of this. Could've done without the reprise of ""And So it Goes"" as well. The best I can say is this includes a few of her great hits from the 70's and the audio quality is nice, but I wish the guy who produced this compilation, Johnny ""D"" De Mairo, included more of her early material. Poorly designed graphics by Lisa Glines features back cover photo of Roberta Flack with a beard (!)"
2,Sound quality is a problem,I love many of Roberta's early hits and particularly remember the sound quality as being excellent. I am very disappointed in the sound quality of this CD. Would not recommend purchase.
1,Don't buy this CD!,"I love the songs on this CD but it was used, had so many scratches, skips, etc. I was afraid is was going to ruin my Bose."
1,Poor Sound Quality,"I purchased the mp3 of ""the first time ever I saw your face"". Unfortunately, poor sound quality, it has static, and skipped a few times throughout the song (similar to listening to some of my old LPs). I am very disappointed."
4,Excellent Book,Great Book....very informative for what i needed. This a must read for anyone that is intrested in learning courtroom practices for Intepreters
5,Great,This book is very user friendly and has a lot of great information. I am a nursing student and it is adding a lot to my clinical experience.
3,Phenomenal archive of Macy's parade,"When I ordered this book, I thought it was another one, which I'd seen in a Barnes and Noble bookstore some years ago. That one had pictures of a number of the ""hosts"" of the parade-like Jackie Gleason, etc. It was closer to a coffee table size. However, I was surprised when this one arrived. This has many more pictures than that book, and mainly of the balloons(which is really the best part). Plus it documents the history of the parade and its high points. This is, by far, the best thing I've ever found on the parade, in any form of media, whatsoever. I'll keep my eyes open for the other book, but this is the ONE to definitely get."
5,GREAT book to read while watching the parade,This is a great book that has the history of the parade and many photos of old Balloons and parade photos.Highly recommended.
3,HISTORY OF A GREAT EVENT,"My nephew marched in this year's parade in the ALL AMERICAN BAND. Purchased the book for him as a primer before he traveled to NY. Prior to giving it to him, I read it. Interesting fact sheet but not totally reader friendly. Not recommended for bed time reading."
4,Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade,"Great Book! The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that it did not arrive covered in plastic. Some of the glue from the envelope stuck to the book, causing part of the cover to tear off. This would not have happened if my purchase had been shrink wrapped. I needed the book for Thanksgiving and did not return it. The book is great. I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in the way it was shipped to me."
4,11 inch wok,"I use this 11 inch wok at home for one or two person servings instead of my 14 inch which is too large and heavy sometimes. The nonstick(inside) and the anodized(outside) finishes on the product look good and the non stick seems to work well(used it about a dozen times so far) with clean up being up to ""non-stick standards."" The unfolded handle has a tiny ""give"" to it where it joins the pan but doesn't affect the tossing action. Only took it car camping once but it's fairly lightweight so carrying it around in a pack shouldn't be an issue in many cases. The lid is perfectly functional as I only use this pan to stir fry/toss."
2,Mercenary detective,"This was my second Luke Starbuck novel and I don't think it was quite as good as ""Hangman's Creek."" Two issues stand out in the character. First, the practical aspect of swimming any distance at all in San Francisco Bay is unlikely due to hypothermia and currents. It is no accident that Alcatraz was built where it is.The other issue is the ""using"" of one of the females to her ultimate death. Luke seems to think that using anyone, even at their peril, is justified so long as he accomplishes his mission. His approach is mercenary and lacks some of the idealism many of us like to see in our western protagonists.It demeans Luke's character in my view.It is still a fair read and Braun remains one of my favorite contemporary western authors."
2,Big Mistake in Complete Idiot's Guide to British Royalty,"Enjoyable sleaze, but there is a big mistake in the House of Windsor Family Tree on page 284. A misplaced line of descent shows Queen Elizabeth and Ptrincess Margaret Rose, (and consequently, all of their descendants) as originating from the marriage of Edward VIII AND Wallis Simpson! Obviously, the line should be shown as coming from the marriage of George VI and Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. A simple typo, no doubt, but it changes the course of English history!"
4,Fun Book,"I bought this book for my wife who for some reason is afflicted with an intense interest in all things royal. I thought I would look though it becuase on this topic I could be called an idiot. Well, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the book. It is well laid out, it holds your attention and does a very good job in describing many items that I would normally glaze over. For the causal observer of the royals this is probably a very good guide. With that said, I have read in some of these other reviews that there are a few errors in the family trees of the book. That was not an important part of my enjoyment or use of the book, and speaking from experience (my wife's collection) if you are that into the royals there are many (many) books that detail family trees down to the family pets. Overall this is an enjoyable book to get the basics and I now can at least understand some of what my wife talks about on this topic."
5,13 centuries of happenings in less than how many pages?!?!?,What I spend four years of my lunch hour every Monday to Friday during high school reading all about the British rulers all comes down to one easy reading book. It's a good book for anyone interested in reading about the history of England and of course some good ol' gossips...
3,Frothy but readable,"The rather stupid marketing-inspired titles aside, this series is often above average in quality and usefulness. Buskin, however, is not an historian but a journalist who especially covered Princess Diana, as well as an author of pop biographies of subjects like Marilyn Monroe and John Lennon, so one might not expect much. His work, while generally accurate -- though he manages, through poor proofreading, to attribute the parentage of Elizabeth II to Edward VIII and Mrs. Warfield in the lineage chart at the back -- and reasonably well written, does tend to cuteness and witty asides. For the rank novice in matters royal, however, this is a servicable primer on the history, traditions, and scandals of 1,200 years of the monarchy in Britain."
4,Wrong publication year.,"The pub. year 2003, cited by Amazon, is wrong (I've submitted a correction). The dictionary was published first in hardcover in Germany in 1989. This unrevised paperback edition was issued for the U.S. market in 2005. If you can do without updates to the vocabulary reflecting changes for the last 15 or so years, it's still a fine dictionary. Otherwise, wait for the new edition which is actually in preparation, according to the publisher."
5,Informative and Interesting,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. While providing detailed information where necessary, it is understandable and useful to readers (like me) who have limited Civil War knowledge. In addition to the substantive factual information, the work provides a human reflection on some of the horrors of this War. For instance, the reference to the horrendous wounds and crude treatments were both educational and moving. I have never been to Gettysburg, however I hope to make a trip this year. I will certainly bring this book along with me as an aide."
1,Hebrews for everyone but me,Poor logic employed -- very disappointing commentary. I have loved & taught the Book of Hebrews for years; this is the worst commentary on it that I have found as of yet.
1,Lack of research,"I find the author to be clear and chatty, but totally out of touch with history or even today's religious world. He describes the ""confession"" of the first century Christians and compares it to the Roman Catholic and Anglican view of ""confession"". He does not relate it to the modern day reform tradition, where Confessions are part of the constitution oof the Presbyterian churches. The Westminster Confession, the Scots' Confession are just two.He has not examined the writings of the Talmud that were written at the time preceding, during and after Jesus time that better described how Jews believed. He makes up his own ideas and passes them off as fact. This was a book written to convince the early Christians that Jesus met the teachings of Scripture as the Messiah and the Son of God, but the Jews that the author described would not have understood the author, but they did understand Hebrews."
2,Not that good,"Not that impressed. Many reviewers have compared this to Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series but I beg to differ. Bike Week Blues is not even close. The humor is forced and the story is cluttered up with so many characters that it is difficult to relate to all that is going on. Constant references to the need for black cohosh for the women to deal with menopause were overdone. I also thought that chasing after Penny Sue's soulmate, Rich, with whom she had spent very little time was unrealistic. I had to force myself to complete this book. It was just not that good."
5,Amazing!,"I love this book. Extremely helpful for teachers who need to understand what is going on with the ""kids these days"""
5,Best book about recognizing demonic power,"Have not read many books about demons and I think after reading Lester Sumrall's that no other will come close to how good this one is. Everything he shares is from real life experience. I really appreciated the knowledge this book gave me, I am better prepared now."
5,"What the world calls mental problems, the bible calls it demon activity","Dr. Sumrall authored over a hundred books not to mention teaching materials for bible college. I have read most of them. This book is another gem in Sumrall's library. If we could all get a hold of this book and learn from Dr. Sumerall's vast experience with demon activity, possession ect, we would all be enlightened to the source and cause of the troubles of our minds, soul and body - we can become free from evil spirits and this book will point you in that direction of liberty in Christ"
4,Experience makes all the difference,"The truth is based on one thing- reality. If you have never traveled outside the U.S., have little or no discernment ability or are a skeptic as to what demons, fallen angels, demi-gods, ghosts etc are, this will be a hard book for you to swallow. Dr. Sumrall spent his life delivering people, only those of us who fight the devil and hear him, see him, can attest to what reality is. Sumrall left us a legacy of information, and if you apply it (and it is scriptural) you can win in life every single day. I highly reccommend this book to family and friends, it is better than the fluff some authors are putting out there today!"
5,Very easy to understand and informative.,"This book is great for those interested in this subject. Although it takes a mature Christian that has solid faith in order not to be turned off by such a deep and truthful view. I love this authors simplicity in writing about something that is not simplistic. This book was entertaining, informative and an overall good & quick read. I suggest you get it and check it out for yourself!"
5,Has the answers..,"This book is the answer book, next to the Bible. A great book to any age Christian. Be prepared to have your spirit encouraged and on fire for the Lord after you read about the great works God has done."
4,Essential Reading for those interested in human evolution,"I share the opinion of others that a bit of editing would have improved the readibility of this volume, it is nonetheless an exciting read. My background is not in anthropology nor paleontology, but I hated to put the book down. I would have appreciated better time-lines and maps (visuals are necessary in this sort of a book). The illustrations were excellent and I learned much that I did not previously know about the history of paleoanthropology, the methods of excavation and dating, and the process of making sense of the research."
2,Wrong title,"I think this should have been called ""How We CAME to Know What We Think We Know About Human Evolution"". It is more of a history of discoveries than discussion on conclusions based on those discoveries.This is my first read in paleoanthropology and I found it a bit difficult. In some cases, discussion on historical hypothesis were glossed over where I felt they could have been elaborated. Although Tattersall comes across as intelligent, I found it to be a slow read due to both vocabulary and flow. Overall, not recommended as a pleasure read."
2,Impossible to read!Paleoanthroplogy was never this dull!,It appears as if Ian has gone out of his way to make this book boring.The material in the book is superb but its presentation is rather poor.
1,This book is why many people don't like science,"I love reading Eldridge, Gould, McGowan... Their writing styles make science come alive. Tattersall, on the other hand, is impossibly dull. He is by far the worst science writer I have ever read, not because his information is incorrect but because his writing style is dryer than the lamest college textbook."
5,A fascinating history of ideas about human evolution.,"Too often we forget that what we believe today is heavily determined by what our predecessors thought. Nowhere is this more true than it is in the study of human evolution, as Ian Tattersall elegantly shows in this smooth-flowing and highly readable book. By blending an engaging account of the discovery of the human fossil record with the history of paleoanthropological analysis, the author shows how the variety of current interpretations arose, and offers an intriguing alternative of his own. If you want to understand where all the controversies that currently rage around the subject of human evolution originated, this lively and well-written book is the source for you."
5,Fascinating!!,"Informative, interesting, and contrary to what Anthony, ... said, a very enjoyable read. This book was recommended to me by one of my professors and was far beyond simply worthwhile; it was scientifically accurate and absolutely fascinating. Ian Tattersall's unique writing style is what makes it that way!!"
1,"Cloying, sophomoric, and flat","I very much enjoyed Lisa Scottoline's first few books, but when I sat down to read this one, from the first sentence I was profoundly disappointed. The style is almost cloyingly sophomoric, the characterizations are more suited to a comic book than a decent read, and Scottoline's attempts at clever similies fail far more often than they succeed (those are the good points, I'm not even going to bother with the plot). My only guess as to why she is writing in such a simple, one-dimensional style is that maybe her publisher or her agent promised her a TV contract if she wrote something silly with a bubbleheaded beauty as the protagonist. However, as different as the style of ""Courting Trouble"" is from some of her earlier novels, I found myself wondering if she had even written this one herself. I cry for the trees that were killed to make the paper for this book."
2,"IF THIS HAD BEEN IN PAPERBACK, IT WOULD HAVE FLOATED AWAY!!!","Bennie, Mary and Judy are back and Anne is the new kid attorney on the block. Anne is smart as a whip, but as flaky and insecure as only ""a wet behing the ears"" new attorney can seem to be. Her facade only serves to hide the inner turmoil with which she has lived all her life. This book certainly fits the category of light summer reading and, if you are a true Scottoline fan like me, you will certainly enjoy it."
1,Disappointing,"There were some many things in this book that were unbelievable that I almost put the book away.The author goes overboard with how beutiful the main chartacter,Anne Murphy is. It appears she may have stolen her love for shoes from Sara Jessica Parkers chartacter on Sex and The City. So happens they are both obsessed with same over priced brand of shoes and shoe poor.The relationship she develops with her associates was very irritating to me. AND her quotes for ""I Love Lucy"" were so lame. ""I have some ""splainen"" to do."" Yuk! I think the Author was trying to write Anne Murphy as a wacky Lucille Ball Chartacter.Although, the ending was surprising and tender it was ruined when the chartacter returned to her home to do her own ""clean up."" It was truly disgusting."
2,Staying Hidden,COURTING TROUBLE By Lisa ScottolineStaying HiddenNot up to her other books. It read like someone who was writing her first book would sound to me. Maybe I've read too many mysteries? She had a good plot but it was handled very young and amateurish. Didn't finish it.I'll give her two stars for the plot.
4,"A QUICK, FUN READ!!","This is a great novel brimming with typical Scottoline action and cutting-edge humor...; I love the books that revolve around Rosato & Associates, taking you into the head of each character. Where I disliked ""Murphy"" in ""The Vendetta Defense,"" seeing her through the eyes of Judy, I developed a true affection for her in this novel. The author takes you into the head of Anne Murphy, where you find that everything isn't as it appears to be; where she appears to be the epitome of physical perfection, the truth is she struggled with a congenital birth defect during her younger years. While grappling with a newfound affection for her coworkers and her boss, and discovering the value of true friendship among the same, Anne must track down the man who thinks that he actually killed her...before he truly succeeds.Scottoline fans won't be disappointed....!"
1,Product placement in books?,"I got heartily sick of reading brands names sprinkled throughout the book. I couldn't care less what brand of shoes etc the protagonist wears.Supremely boring book, in all, and I couldn't wait for it to be over. More fool me for sticking with it until the end.Mental note: don't read another Lisa Scottoline book. Life's too short."
1,Did not like it at all,"This is my first Lisa Scottoline and probably my last. I got very burned out on the word ""Kevin"". It was in almost every paragraph. And at the end where she goes out in the July 4th crowd with her gun to kill ""Kevin"" was unbelievable. Kill someone in a crowd of people when he probably had a gun too. Come on, how dangerous could that be?? Needless to say, I was very disappointed in the book."
2,disappointed,"I am a fan of Lisa Scottoline. However, this book was disappointing to me. I found that I really didn't care what happend to the lead character. I had just read ""Running From the Law"" right before this, also by Scottoline, and found the plot very similiar. I would not recommend this book. I would recommend ""Look Again"" and ""Daddy's Girl""."
2,Disappointing,"I've enjoyed this author before, but this book was just plain silly.There was no suspense, even when the ""surprise twist ending"" showed up -- because it wasn't any surprise. It was very ""Thelma and Louise"" rather than the murder/suspense novel I thought I was buying. Anne was totally shallow and unlikeable, and even the other Rosato & Associates ladies, who I'd enjoyed before, got on my nerves.And I'm glad to see by reading these reviews that I'm not the only one who got tired of the Mental Notes. Once is cute, twice is acceptable, three times in annoying, 500 times and you just want to reach out and throttle both the character and the author."
2,Predictable and formulaic,"A suspenseful and original mystery/thriller is always a great find. A predictable and formulaic novel of the aforementioned genre is a complete waste of time and money. Courting Trouble is the ladder.When her friend is found murdered, Anne Murphy realizes that her mysterious past has come back to haunt her. Someone's out to get her, which is why she has to maintain a low profile. But how could she do that when she's working on a highly publicized case?The overall story development is slow and misguided at times. Also, as previously mentioned, the novel follows a rather predictable formula. However, I will not rule this author's work out entirely. Perhaps in the future she will write a thriller that will set it apart from the rest..."
2,"""Will the real Lisa Scottoline please stand up""","No way can I believe Lisa Scottoline wrote this 'IRRITAING' (at best) story! Major Bummer going on here! I am normally a huge fan of this writer, but not with this one. The only reason I even attempted to finish the damn thing was because I paid good money for it. I am so disappointed. The only redeeming quality in this tragedy of errors was the cover of the book. (lol.)"
2,Underwhelming at Best!,"Very disappointing effort for Ms. Scottoline. This plot concept was extremely difficult to believe and the whodunit so very easy to figure out at the onset. I expect much more than what I received from this contrived tale. Get real - at least part of the time! Borrow it from your public library, but definitely a buyer beware sticker should be placed on this one."
3,It was good and good characters,It was good.... not as good as some of her other books.. too much description at times. Characters are well played.
2,pretty dumb...,"I don't like when authors interject a pun or witty comment, and this book is loaded with really dumb ""mental notes"" of the main character, much like a sitcom character forcing a bad joke for the laughtrack to respond with fake laughter. Anyway, the characters are likeable enough, but there was no suspense or cliffhangers to keep me hooked. I often had to read over and over b/c my mind would easily get distracted. I want to be absorbed into a book and it just never happened. Spoiler alert: The reader knows from the beginning who the bad guy is, and I kept waiting for a dramatical twist that never came. This is my 2nd Lisa Scottoline book and both were mediocre at best. I doubt I will try again as there are too many better options out there."
5,loved it,this book that i listened to on audio CD kept me awake and aching for more on my long trip to missouri!!! wonderful book!!! wish there were more think this!!
3,Stalker,"Anne Murphy is defending a man who is on trial for sexual harrasment. She goes to the Atlantic shore to relax and work on the case and asks a friend to house sit for her. While she is gone, the friend is murdered and she realizes that a stalker from her past has caught up with her and has committed this terrible crime. The rest of the book involves Anne trying to catch the stalker before he catches her. Having read several other Lisa Scottoline books, I am used to much more creative and involved plots than this one. The characters also make some pretty dramatic changes without much reason. For instance her colleagues, who have been cool and distant to her, suddenly become her best friends when they discover that she hasn't been murdered, as they had thought. Also her mother and her client display sudden character changes which just don't ring true. If you want to read a Lisa Scottoline book, don't start with this one or it may discourage you from reading the rest."
3,Oh the possibilities,"I am puzzled by this novel. We have a good character, a nice plot twist, a great setting...but. Anne Murphy, bright and beautiful young lawyer, recently moved to Philadelphia from the west coast is presumed victim of a homicide, and like Mark Twain, reports of her demise are premature. The plot revolves around an axis of her resurrected self and law firm partners attempting to bag the murderer. While this goes on, she learns a bit about the art of personal relationships. That's a valuable character twist. And there is a plot ""sting."" It's fun. Still, the author can be disappointing. The use of upscale brand labels in the first few chapters comes close to today's movies. And there is just a bit too much self doubt in the partners of her well educated, Philadelphia, female law firm's partners. I guess the disappointment is that Anne is almost a ""mensch."" Oh, well. I think this author might really have it. I'll read another one. But please no more attack of the brand names."
3,Average,"Although a fan of the first few books in Ms. Scottoline's series, I find this one formulaic and very predictable."
2,Scottoline is coasting downhill,"Although Scottoline has some good mysteries and thrillers to her credit, this book has little mystery to it, and few thrills. A very slight plot is stretched quite thin over too many pages. As for the characters, the newest member of the all-woman law firm has plenty of pluck, but little common sense (why doesn't she whip out her cell phone and call for backup all those times she spots her stalker?) Worse still, the other members of the firm appear to have dumbed down considerably from the previous books in the series. If this was any lighter, it would blow away in your hands."
3,Courting Three Stars,"Courting Trouble, by Lisa Scottoline, is a decent enough book. It offers several twists and turns and just enough suspense to keep one guessing and interested. I found the book enjoyable, but nothing to write home about. The plot reminded me of vintage Sidney Sheldon, which is not a bad thing; it is just not a new thing. I give this book a solid three (3) Stars."
3,interesting,"I have not read any of Scottoline's other novels, so I have nothing to compare it to. And many of the scenes that take place are highly unrealistic, which ordinarily would annoy me. There are other annoying quirks, such as the ""Mental Notes."" But I liked Anne Murphy, silliness and all. I read this in a day because it was fun and a diversion from most of the serious stuff I read for a living."
4,Entertaining read,"Though I found it hard to believe the heroine would deliberately put herself in so much danger to catch a killer, I loved the characters. The book moved along at a fast pace and reached a point where I couldn't put it down."
1,MENTAL NOTE: SOME LAWYERS MAKE LOUSY WRITERS,"MENTAL NOTE: SOME LAWYERS MAKE LOUSY WRITERS:Publishers Weekly said Scottoline's writing might be cloying to readers. You think? This is understatement. I am stunned that this writer won an Edgar. One assumes a writer wins the award for their WRITING ... but if the writing in this book is any indication, this particular ""author"" can't have won it for that reason. For what? NO clue. It is amateurish to the nth degree. The story is predictable, silly, and about as exciting as eating Pablum. I always defend mysteries to those who say, ""Oh I don't read mysteries."" There are so many really good writers out there doing real mysteries - well written, well plotted, strong character development etc. But in this case there is nothing to defend. It is everything I dislike in ""formula"" mystery. No real character development. Trite yet lacking in real humor. Gimmicky. Full of old old cliches. Full of fluff and no substance. Full of boring."
4,Bischoff keeps the sprit alive,"A friend let me read this book, it was one of the few books that I have read and had to go and buy a copy. Mr. Bischoff keeps true to the sprit of Philip K. Dick, but has done a story that stand on its own. I think and any person that enjoys the novels and short stories by Philip K. Dick will enjoy this book."
5,Drop in on a dying culture,"If you are interested in Gypsy music and dance this is an incredible look at the culture, sans boring narration blah blah. Because Mr. Gatlif had unprecedented access to these relatively unspoiled groups of performers, the viewer feels like a traveler on the Gypsy Trail, starting out in India,through Egypt, Turkey and through the Balkans, ending with a lively village Flamenco scene. I wish that they had continued into England and Ireland, but that is a minor quibble. Each scene goes directly into the performances, with so much feeling and joy. Not to be missed."
1,this film is fabulous but in the old Video cassette format,Didn't realize it was in the old VHS format as I was really hoping to find it in DVD format. It still made a great gift to someone who loves the film and is hoping to have a friend do the format transfer
4,About the film itself...,"I had seen this years ago and wanted to have it for future enjoyment -- such a feast of color, music, and dance. Such a testimony to the journey of the people from Rajasthan traveling towards Europe -- the gypsies, the Rom. These many years later, I realize the style/technique of the film is somewhat dated (not a big deal), and that these are actors, not real moments captured on the spot. Very minor disappointment. I still enjoy this film."
4,Haunting review of gypsy music,"Without roles or dialog, this is a film following gypsy music and life through several countruies. It is for families who like music and travel"
5,Great film,"The manouche sequence in France is worth the price of the film, especially if you're a Django fan."
3,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to watching this film which I had seen when it came out a few years ago. I enjoyed the music but gradually realized this was not the original. There were parts that I distinctly remembered, i.e., the scene with Django Reinhart and Steffen Grapelli performing, and in which they were identified in more detail. (Not even named in the copy I purchased.) Also, the various countries through which the caravans travelled were identified on screen. In short, I was not happy and I was sorry I wrote a review before I had viewed the CD. I tried to change it, as I tried to change my 3-star rating above to 2 stars today but apparently you don't allow that"
1,Don't be misguided by the positive reviews,"This is only a very VERY long music video. I expected more information on the life of gypsies.If you would like to know more about gypsies this is not the documentary to choose. There is no information about anything whatsoever, just singing and singing. There is no narrator and people hardly ever talk, so most of the time you have to guess where they are or what their problems are. The video is nice for the first 10 or 15 minutes and some short scenes, but mostly is just plain boring. The music is good, but if you expect something more than that, you'll be disappointed."
3,Great decor,These candles are perfect for the avid wine lovers who want to continue to hold onto that memorable empty bottle of wine.
1,NOT WORTH 2 CENTS,"Video totally useless I asked for my money back they told me I bought it, its mine. I've read many books on blackjackwhich had more information than this video."
4,A Good Tool for any Business or even Students.,"I have checked my University's library and find that there's very few book about this topic. I find Mr. Peoples' book full of experience and advices. I almost want to rate this book (paper back version) 10 marks, but I found the charts as well as the page layouts are sometimes just demonstrate the down sides of good presentations. Hope the next revised edition can look into this and use some more ""updated"" cliparts as well. the printing and paper used are also need improve.Brian Wong, Hong Kong."
1,"Not color-fast, heavy with dye","The information on the Amazon site for these rugs says they are ""Triple washed after dyeing to prevent color transfer"" and also ""Prairie rugs are machine washable in cold water."" I was surprised when the red one that I ordered arrived because I could smell the dye and could see that the material was very likely going to fade badly when washed.Hoping for a miracle of modern technology, I washed the rug in cold water with a mild detergent. I put a small piece of white cloth in the wash to see how color-fast the rug might be. The result: the washing water quickly became bright red, the white cloth is now bright pink, and the rug.... I got red dye on my hands when I took the rug out of the washer! My plan now is to throw the rug away because I think it would be dangerous to my wood floors to have a rug that leaks dye when it gets wet."
2,Prairie Rug,"The rug was not as pictured. There are tassles (not sure what else to call them)on each end that are not pictured. I would not have bought this rug if I knew this. Also, there was no return instuctions, making it difficult to return. So I cut of the tasssles and put the rug in a basement door way. A complete waste of money for me."
4,Classic fantasy!,"This book is really good. It was a nice blend of mythological animals, fantasy, simbolizm, and morals. If you like such fantasy books as redwall, the hobbit, Dune,etc. Then you'll love this book."
3,"Enjoyable reading, best for teenagers.","This is a well-done fantasy. The book's blurb compares it to ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Watership Down,"" and with those comparisons I would generally agree. I wasn't that enthused about it because I prefer fantasies (and myths) with human characters instead of animals and it suffers by comparison with Orson Scott Card's ""Worthing Chronicle,"" a human myth that I read immediately prior. The blurb also says ""Dun Cow"" should be of interest to all age groups. I think young adults would be most likely to appreciate its characters while not being taken aback by its fairly violent and scary parts."
2,Poor voice characterization,"The Audio version of this book isn't very good. The voice characterizations don't fit. I mean that the fox doesn't sound like what a fox should sound like, and the dog doesn't sound like what a dog should sound like. Most importantly, the crow should have sounded strong and regal. He is the lord of his lands and master of all that lived in the land. The voice is not suited at all. When the narrator speaks as a narrator, the story is OK. When he speaks as one of the characters, it doesn't fit."
4,Digital Camera Mini Tripod,Product works great. It arrived on time and in good condition. Seller lived up to all promises.
1,Don't buy it !,This book is very boring. I was very disappointed. If you try to learn this technics you won't have time to study.Maybe it just didin't work for me. There are better books out there on this subject.
5,Superb!!!,"An excellent mix of fantasy and history blend with your own imagination in this novel.It almost seemed as you were watching various aspects of history being written. (Some parts a little tongue in cheek, I believe).A very hard book to put down, and then, when you finish it, you have to re-read it. Too much to keep up with the first time.A sequel would be appreciated, but difficult to accomplish."
3,Whew!,The Anubis Gates delivers to those with the perseverance to see it through to the end...a story within a story within a story.
3,Whoever said this is science fiction?,Go back in time via some magical unexplained means and visit lots of ghouls and goblins. I thought it kinda dragged. I would have been less offended had it not been called 'science fiction'. Where was the science?
4,Fun time travel romp,"Fun time travel romp by Tim Powers. Mild mannered literature professor gets stranded in 1810 in London, and has adventures with evil Egyptian sorcerers, a murderous clown, gypsies and a werewolf named 'Dog-faced Joe'. The portions concerning Horrabin the clown and 'Dog faced Joe' were excellent. ** spoiler alert ** I thought the story was very good excepting the diversions to 1680's London and Egypt. The foray into Egypt, in particular felt 'undercooked'. Also the whole evil plot of destroying the British empire, in order to restore the ancient Egyptian gods, didn't make much sense to me. After all by 1810 Egypt had been Islamic for over a thousand years- if Anubis, Horus, Isis et al. could survive that, I'm sure they'd be ok with the British."
4,Powerful Tim(e) Travel,"Powers has written a different take on the ""if I went back in time and changed this, then ...."" I think his characters, and there are some strange ones, are what makes his take on this theme so good. You almost have to make notes to keep the various incarnations apart and know who is who and who isn't.The reason for only four stars is that I felt the ending was weaker than the rest of the book. All the convolutions that had taken up the first 300+ pages cried out for a more elegant finish. Even so, taken as a whole, it was a fun read."
5,Just buy it,"Ever since I read an interview where Tim Powers said he'd never create an invisible character who could see (because light wouldn't stop at his invisible eyes, thus never register on his optic nerve) I knew I had to read his books. I like the way his mind works. And I loved The Anubis Gates.If it's any indication of the popularity of his work; I've only once been able to get a used paperback from my favorite used bookseller. ""His books sell immediately,"" the store owner told me."
5,One of the best books I have ever read!,"I don't need to say much about this book except, ""You must buy and read this book!"" A fantastic and original story of fantasy, history, magic and action. For pure entertainment, this book is hard to beat. I had read almost all of Powers' books before reading this one, and this is the best he has produced. Since he is one of my favorite authors, I cannot praise it more highly than that."
3,If you're aware of the concept of a Predestination Paradox..,"then this book holds no surprises. or ""Nice, but don't believe the hyperbole.""An eccentric modern day gentleman (rich, old and dying) takes a select few on an experimental trip through time. However, almost from the outset of the story, the author drags the focus away from the main narrative to focus on minor and obscure things. You can practically see a big sign with ""Pay attention to this minor bit, it will become important later."" As a result, all of the so-called ""surprises"" in this book fell flat for me, as I felt they were telegraphed from the start of the book. Anyone even familar with the concept of travelling to the past because *you've always gone back* will likewise find no surprises. That said, the book is entertaining, if trite. There are far better books out there, but this is a diverting enough read, for about 5 hours."
2,Disappointing,"The Anubis Gates has very little to do with ancient Egypt, Anubis, but more about gates into time travel. After the first 100 pages things started to fall into place, but with this book, its hard to keep on track. Beware, the author constantly changes people, time and places, from beggars in England, Lord Bryon, a weird clown, sadistic torture and the ""yags"". I found the ending (last 50 pages without interest). Expecting a book about ancient Egypt, this was not it. It could have been written with much less confusion to circumstances to present a book about time travel."
3,High expectations may have ruined it for me.,"Having read Expiration Date and Earthquake Weather, I expected Anubis Gates to be as good as those two. I had also heard from a few different people that it was Powers' bets book. So perhaps that is why I wasn't as happy with it as his other books.The thing that initially turned me off about the book were the two groups of beggars in London. They seemed entirely unrealistic, and I had come to think of Powers as a writer that can do fantasy that is plausible in the real world. However, many aspects of this book seemed implausible to me.I did like his spin on time travel, however. Its nice to read a book featuring time travel that isn't all about going back and fixing things. That was a positive aspect.All in all I thought this was a decent book. I may have enjoyed it more if I didn't have such high expectations for it. If you've never read Powers, you'll probably enjoy it immensely, because it does have his characteristic depth and imagination."
1,Had To Struggle To Finish,"It is rare ever that I have not finished reading a book. I love to read and always have a book on hand- whether it's my Kindle or an author I collect. This book was really hard to get through. I have never read Tim Powers before and would be reluctant to read another of his books. The beginning of the story and the idea of the story was great and I was sucked in right away but then something happens and it was just too ""jumbly"" in the middle and several times I wanted to put it down. But in the spirit of ""giving it a chance"" to redeem itself- too little too late."
4,Great read - tons of awesome ideas!!,"My only real gripe with Anubis Gates was that Mr. Powers basically lost a couple of his most interesting characters for about 100 pages or so. Without going into spoilers, I really missed reading more about Jacky and the Clown. Sure, the last 20 or so pages were awesome and neatly wrapped things up (nice ending!), but it would have been nice to have spent more time with these characters. All in all, this was an amazing read. Loved the mysticism, the Egyptian historical stuff, the sorcery, the historical characters, the time-travel, the sci-fi!! Highly recommended."
3,"Good ending, but slow to get there","After all the hype, I picked up a copy of this book with great enthusiasm. I thought it was a good concept, but the plot was slow in unravelling and there was a mix of characters that was sometimes hard to follow. However, it does come together beautifully in the end."
5,"Move over, Indiana Jones, for Tim Power's THE ANUBIS GATES!","Tim Power's foremost work (I've read them all), THE ANUBIS GATES is a non-stop, entertaining thrill ride that is superbly crafted in a most difficult genre: period science fiction. Easily one of the ten best books I've ever read, THE ANUBIS GATES is a classic work of fiction for the ages - a MUST for any action-adventure library.Bravo!"
1,One of the dumbest sci fi books Iv'e ever read.,"Contrived situation. Stupid, cliff hangers with even stupider escapes. sophomoric references to history and folklore. What more could you ask...Have you heard if a literary device called a ""dio ex machina"". It means a stupid, unlikely plot twist to get out of a situation. How about a real honest to Betsy ""dio ex machina""here comes the spoiler...Our hero survived after being shot, stabbed, poisoned, beaten, and tortured to near death because he is saved by... THE GODS!!!Hooray!! He comes back, brand new, in one piece, and marries the the girl of his dreams!It totally amazes me how many five star ratings this piece of trash got."
4,Best fantasy treatment of time travel I've ever read,"Tim Powers managed to do what a number of other noted luminaries in scifi/fantasy have failed to do-- written a novel featuring time travel that wasn't annoying. I think that this is because he doesn't waste a lot of time worrying about the science of it, or the potential for paradox, he just enjoys the ride (and so does the reader).A failed biographer gets his chance of a lifetime and gets a lot more than he bargained for-- featuring avenging maidens, body-switching murderers, beggar lords, and Egyptian gods. Somewhat lighter than other Tim Powers books (I'm unlikely to reread, I fear) but still very entertaining and astonishingly well-written."
2,Highly overrated. Reader beware!,"I know this is a popular book and Tim Powers has many fans, but honestly, he is a mediocre at best, and horrendous at worst writer. His writing style is jumpy, his plotlines don't mesh well, his characters are one-dimensional, and his jokes aren't funny. While admittedly there are a few nice ideas buried in the story, especially the way he ties in Egyptian lore with strange magic, the book was a chore for me to read. I had to will myself just to finish it. I think I wouldn't have minded this book as much a five or ten years ago, before I read luminaries like Gene Wolf and G.R.R. Martin, but unfortunately for Tim Powers, his writing comes off as hackish."
2,Really uneven and not as good as the reviews make it out to be,"I was excited for about half of the book--interesting characters, unique plot twists, fun action sequences, original premise. Then it just went on and on as if the author was trying to make it as complicated as possible or didn't know how to end the thing (or both). The book is overwritten and should have been wrapped up about 100 pages earlier. This is nowhere near as good as the the reviews here lead you on to believe."
1,Garbage,"I am a sci-fi/fantasy junkie, and hated this book. The excessive number of unnecessary characters and subplots made it hard to follow, and Powers had to resort to dei ex machina several times to close them out. The middle third of the book read like a bad James Bond movie on steroids, with the principal character being chased by either 4 or 5 separate groups. The last 50 pages were pure looney-tunes. Good fantasy sets itself rules, and lives within them - this book did not."
3,the lord says its ok.,short and easy to say its ok.good action lots of blood a ok story but some great characters.the doctor and the 2 little girls are the best they are alittle dark and creepy just the way i like them.its 6 episode 25 min each so a watch in 1 sitting thing so alittle short to.its a good buy for $20 or 25 but its hard to say for anymore then that.SAY THE LORD! LOL
4,DPW,These episodes were very entertaining. I aggree with the review that says this story would be better with more episodes. Well maybe someone will do that someday. For now it is a good show of the Sci-fi/fantasy type and if that appeals to you than enjoy what there is of it.
4,good,This dvd played like new and I enjoyed the movie also. It was sent US mail and was rapped in packing tape which kept anyone from stealing the dvd. Thanks
5,Bosch Jam Saw,"If you install hardwood flooring or laminate flooring this saw is the best on the market. I have two other types but, this one is the best"
2,A Compromised Sheherazade,"Simply stated, this performance has been undermined by a recording team who has failed in its task. The louder the music gets, the more congested and shallow the sound becomes. Just when you would love to revel in the sound this marvelous orchestra can produce, you are confronted with the paradox of a great resonant acoustic collapsing before your very ears.This is deeply disappointing given the marvelous previous recordings of Scriabin, Stravinsky and Tchaikovsky.More satisfying recordings which capture marvelous performances and better sound would be Chicago/Reiner and Mehta/LAPO."
1,Pricing way out of line,"These can be purchased much, much cheaper- jbr17llc.com. The SKF race hub is $350, why in the world would someone pay this much for the standard hub when they could have the race hub for a few $$$$ more? And, no, you can not get the race hub from that source, they only sell the standard hubs."
2,Junk of money tips,"Listened audio tape edition of this book. Though the contents are somewhat helpful, the recording is all junk of money tips. I don't understand why the author needed to discuss Mutual fund, Neighborhood, Nursing Home, then Outsourcing (your business) followed by Pension plan in that order. Can Mutual fund and Pension plan be discussed in sequence?Each one of topic is not discussed in detail, so you better off read a book for particular topic you are interested. I would call this book ""Complete Book of Incomplete Money Tips""."
3,"Good info, just not right for the audio cassette format","I love Stephen Pollan's work. However, listening to the Complete Book of Money on cassette is like listeining to an encyclopedia on cassette. The book is written as a reference and the audio version is basically the author reading each entry in alphabetical order. I loved the intro where he reviews topics from other books as a primer for the info to follow.I'll buy the book and keep it on my shelf as a reference, but I don't know if I'll ever be able to finish all 4 cassettes.Buy the book- the info is great."
2,too much emphasis on a clinical stand point,"I have to wade through clinical explanations about why people do what they do. The verbage is such that its more like Im sitting in a class or a open forum led by a phychiatrist. It would be more user friendly to explain and give examples, maybe explain what they are trying to accomplish by negative behavior and how you can defuse it by using our behavior and reactions. That would have made it an easier read....but its laborious to me be talked to like Im a counselor or psychiatrist instead of an average joe."
5,When poetry meets progressive rock,"If you are curious about the blend of poetry and progressive rock, this is it. A beautiful historical performance of Fabizio de Andre (an icon among the Italian singer/songwriters of the 70's and 80's) together with Italy's most outstanding progressive rock groups - Premiata Forneria Marconi. This selection contains some of the most beautiful italian songs ever composed. PFM brings creativity in the musical arrangement of de Andre's touching lyrics. A true emotional experience. Never to be repeated. De Andre died in January 1999. He lives though through his creative legacy. This CD is a part of it. Make it yours."
3,I agree that kireviewer doesn't know music,"In Italy de Andre' is viewed as much as a poet as musician. Hence not understanding the words will be a major hindrance to any reviewer, let alone one as bad as kireviewer."
1,This product will not work correctly,On GM products this clamp kit will not work. It needs to redesigned or relabled. Don't waste your time or money.
3,"Great Concept, design could be better (fits F150's too)","I ordered this unit from Amazon with Prime and it showed up in two days. Great pricing compared to local dealers and no tax/freight! I installed this unit myself, The units comes with terrible directions, and many parts. Basically no-lip, medium-lip, and large-lip clamps to use based on your situation / truck bed. You will see what I mean when you order/install. Overall, the product worked, and it was great it came with multiple sizes to fit any install scenario. The directions could have been better, but the ultimate end product turned out very nice without having to drill holes in my truck.Also, as my title notes. This DOES fit a Ford F150 too."
5,Indigo's Star,"I love this book! I just found out that it is a series of four. I am going to read them all! The first book is Saffy's Angel, then Indigo's Star, then Permanent Rose, and then Caddy Ever After. I hope Hilary McKay writes more books about the Casson family!"
3,Indigo's Star,"I chose to read Indigo's Star. This is a realistic fiction book by Hilary Mckay. This book is about a boy named Indigo who lives in England. Indigo struggles with bullies and gangs in his school.Tom, a boy from America is also a main character in this book. He becomes friends with Indigo and helps him stand up against ""the gang"".one of the things I most liek about this book is Indigo's family. They are sweet caring people who never judge anyone.This is a good book that teaches alot of lessons. I think this book is for people from 4th to 6th grades."
3,"Heavy on Info, Light on Substance","I teach a U.S. History course for a local college and have utilized this textbook in conjunction with more substantive books that provide deeper assessment and critical analysis of historical events. While this text is good for a survey course, I would not recommend it for a history student who wants to delve into a more nuanced and robust analysis of U.S. History. The tone and pace is what one might expect from a textbook, laborious to read and monotone in prose. One nice aspect is the introduction of controversial topics throughout the text. While the book does not provide an expansive background of the more controversial topics, it does provide a satisfactory introduction that can lead to a more in-depth review from other sources of both primary and secondary nature."
3,"big, big, big , big, big","I am a high school student who just recieved this book for the year. The teacher claims that it is a college level text book, and after a few nights of reading, i agree with him. This stuff is really hard to read. It reads somewhat similarly to a primary source, very wordy with very long sentences. It is very hard to concentrate while reading, so it is vital to take notes while reading. My class and i agree that 10 pages takes about an hour with notes. And it is hard to take notes out too because it is difficult to pick out the most important information."
2,Perfect album to play when unwanted relatives are visiting!,"Or your grandparents! They'll love this too, send it to 'em. Because why send them a card, when you can send them into cardiac arrest?Actually, who COULDN'T love this?? With such heartwarming lyrics like:""I wish I had a c***I'd rub it in your faceI'd shove it in your mouthYou'd really like the tasteThen I'd STICK IT UP YOUR @$$,SHOVE IT UP YOUR @$$,RAM IT UP YOUR @$$!""Needless to say, this album can't be taken seriously. It's quite hilarious actually. Hilariously bad. You'll want to be completely alone when listening to this - or better yet - don't listen to it at all."
5,Best Green Tea - Ever!,"My first Bigelow tea was Plantation Mint. I absolutely love it and it was the tea that got the rest of my family drinking less soda and more tea. Green tea has many benefits, everybody pretty much knows this, but I always found them to be too bland, or grassy, or overflavored with other things - until I tried Bigelow's Green Tea with Lemon. It is perfect. Fresh, crisp, quenching. I prefer tea iced with a little splenda added, and this one and Plantation Mint are so delicious. I'm a convert. I can't imagine ever drinking another brand, and I've tried several."
2,Difficulties with Save cash on books,I never received the book. I do not even know if they canceled or not the order. They told me the book is lost and they do not have more copies available. Please consider it canceled and please reimburse my money because I will order the book from someone else since I need it ASAP.Thank youGloria
1,Had 2 and both stopped working within 6 months.,"Five years ago, purchased two Morning Industry locks (that still work to this day). Later, when we wanted to add keyless locks to the other outside doors, Morning Industry had re-designed the locks. We bought two and the unlock function on both doors began working sporatically, requiring more and more attempts to get the doors to unlock. Then, they simply wouldn't unlock the doors - all within 6 months. Keyless Entry Locks are not cheap and, if I had it to do over again, I would not invest the time and money for this keypad lock."
4,Good buy,"We purchased this doorknob/lock to replace our shotty garage door entrance lock. We immediately loved the new appearance in contrast to our old. The latch mechanism also closes very smoothly and with little force required, a huge difference compared to our old.The door lock has a neat feature to auto-lock 10 seconds after opening removing any doubt if we had locked the door. I believe you have the option of up to an 8 character key code. We don't even use a key for this door anymore, relying solely on the keypad. There is no signs of wear or the numbers fading yet after ~ 2 months of usage every day.The only complaint is the knob is sometimes difficult to turn, we haven't determined the cause yet but sometimes its buttery smooth to turn but every once in a while it takes a FIRM grip and twist(or quick jiggle) to get the knob to turn. Might be detrimental if you ever in the need to enter/exit quickly."
2,One fatal flaw,"This is almost a really neat item. I have had one on the door from my house to my garage for around 10 months. I love the convenience of not having to dig out a key to get into the house when I park my car. What is the fatal flaw? The door can be opened from the inside with the lock locked. Conventional door knobs do not let you turn the knob with the lock locked. You could argue that this is more secure as you won't forget to lock your door. I would argue that the 167th time that you step out into your garage for just a second and then have to enter the #$*ing combination to get back in because you forgot to unlock the door first, the idea of touchpad entry into your house loses almost all of its charm."
5,Simplify Life,I purchased this for my home office so I don't have to carry a key around the house but need to keep the kids out. I installed it within minutes with no problem. Directions were easy to follow. My office is now secure and my kids keep trying to break the code but haven't been able to. Great Product!!!
5,"Simple, no frills, to the point","This is the most straightforward presentation of nonduality that I have read. Uncomplicated, no wasted words, no frills. He says the same thing over and over again relentlessly with no wandering off the point. That's what I like about this book. The point is a simple one, and he presents it simply."
1,Bad,Unlike one of the two reviewers who give it five stars I read the whole book. I realise Bob is trying to put non duality philosophy into his own words. Unfortunately he just repeats the same words all the time even to questions that are not related. He avoids difficult/deep questions by waiting until another question is put. I finished the book then binned it.
2,The Doctor is Preferable,"Had high hopes for this, and was disappointed. Sounds more mainstream 60's British pop than psychedelic.Competent playing, average vocals, and forgettable melodies. An album for collectors of albums from the era, not for listeners."
4,Excellent,"Very cool power pop psych from the late 1960s.Apple a day are panio driven, with self-contained straight forward songs. Remember ""We Love You?"" by the Stones--it is that kind of volume spiked, shining keybord.For psych, this is pretty light. Not in a Lemmon Pipper's sense, but if you can picture the craft of Syd Barret with absolutely none of the acidisms, Apple A Day sounds like this. Still, it runs on rock and roll apple seeds.This may not keep the doctor away, but will put you in a hell of a good mood.(Wow. First time I have seen 2-0-1-0 in print. Looks odd.)"
4,Blue Cheer - 'New Improved! Blue Cheer' (Repertoire),"Originally released in 1969,as this was Blue Cheer's third album. Almost as good as their first two lp's,'Vincebus Eruptum' and 'Outsideinside' (see my reviews on both). Even though bassist/vocalist Dickie Peterson and drummer Paul Whaley are joined by two 'new' guitarists Randy Holden and Bruce Stephens,'New Improved!' is still a worthy pick.Tracks that impressed me the most were ""West Coast Child Of Sunshine""(a good psychedelic piece),""Aces 'N Eights"",their Dylan cover ""It Takes A Lot To Laugh,It Takes a Train To Cry"" and ""Honey Butter Lover"".Find a site that offers sound clips of this CD,then go from there."
4,"Not bad, but took some getting used to.","Not a bad CD at all, but it took some getting used to. I wasn't a huge fan, upon the first five or so spins, but afterwards the material began to grow on me. Not many of the tunes are instantly recallable, even then, but I'd say the CD is for fans of the band, for sure. If you are already into the group, you will recognize ""Icebergs"" and ""Peace of Mind"" from compilations. Others will find the slightly progressive material tough to listen to, due to the rough edges and cryptic musical and lyrical references. It is a worthwhile listen, though."
3,New Improved? It's more unorganized and bitter,"I found this to be a transitional Blue Cheer album. 1. It's more subtle, and unplugged, and 2. Leigh Stephens leaves the group. Yes he does contribute to most of the material for Side 1 of this album, but he leaves during the recording sessions. Dick Peterson the unofficial leader of the group brings in former bandmate Randy Holden from the Other Half. Holden brings the 2 strongest songs on this album in ""Peace Of Mind"" a song about a relationship mired in mistrust, and violence, and ""Fruits & Icebergs"". Holden would do this song on his solo album ""Population 2"". The rest is alright, but the power that Stephens generated on the first 2 albums was gone. Holden would be gone after this album, and Peterson would bring in Gary Yoder, and Bruce Kellogg into the group, and would go on for 3 more years before disbanding."
5,improved indeed!!,"This one really showed a tighter more refined sound..Leading in with that wha sound your hooked!.. A lot of more catchy but certainly not commercial tunes.. I wore out two origional albums, forgot about them,, recently got in the mood for the CD..As with the album nicely recorded for the time.. We grew up with acid rock but there certainly is room for this style again now.. Recommended for all us old hippies and those who want to explore this great style.."
3,"new , yes improved?",This lp is interesting in its obscurity. Cheer had lost the pier shattering feedback of Leigh Stephens . This is not a loud heavy blues lp. It has nice songs occasional guitar work. Its a B- or C effort unless you're stuck in the psychedelic era.
4,COLE SINGS,"Of great interest to any PORTER fan,because you actually can hear him sing 8 songs.Arguably,this is not the first cd you must choose to discover his music.I enjoyed hearing ANYTHING GOES from the voice of it's writer;this song,the title of one of PORTER's most famous show is often used in commercials.Among the highlights are THE PHYSICIAN,FIND ME A PRIMITIVE MAN and THE COCOTTE,not usually present in collections celebrating the composer.Should you buy it?If COLE PORTER is your favorite composer,yes.If not, you can let it go.If you've never heard his voice before,you could think like me,that he was born in a upper class manoir in ENGLAND.Of course,this is not the case because he was born in PERU,INDIANA.PORTER remains unique among the composers of his generation.His love of the FRENCH culture has always set him apart of his colleagues."
1,"I, Richard","This book stinks. I'm donating mine to the public library so that other readers, who feel compelled to read all of George's books, do not waste their hard earned money on this one. What was she thinking and what were her publishers thinking when this one went to press?"
1,Not today,"Five crime stories. I read the first. Damn, ain't no way to solve the thing until you read the last page, and I waded through all kinds of cardboard cutouts and cliches to get there. I quit reading."
1,What a disappointment!,"I was so excited when I saw that another Elizabeth George book had been published I wanted to read it right away - but what a disappointment it was! I was willing to give her plenty of leeway because I'd enjoyed all her other books so much. But some of the stories were not even well written, and none of them are up to her usual fine writing, characterization and plot development. I do hope she is at this moment working on a mystery novel that will make me forget that this one ever saw the light of day."
1,A sham.,"Elizabeth George wrote this collection of short stories (with the possible exception of one) in 1999. It was called The Evidence Exposed. If you buy this ""new"" book expecting new material from a really great writer, you will easily recognize the stories. I am horrified that she and her publisher would pull such a trick."
1,Really zero stars!,"I'm a former fan of George's but this is the worst book I've tried to read in years, in fact, I simply couldn't finish it. First time I've wanted to ask Amazon[.com] to refund my money! Should never have been published. Characters are one dimensional, plots are silly, no redeeming literary or entertainment qualities, a general waste of time, either author or publisher cashing in on what was a strong name in her genre."
1,A major disappointment,It has always been worth waiting a year for a George novel - One of my favorite authors. But this book of short stories - not a novel is very disappointing and the stories are not up to her usual fine writings.
1,Extremely disappointing,"What a pity! An author like Elizabeth George - specially after having written A TRAITOR TO MEMORY should not bow to editors and write just a plain, uninteresting book exclusively for commercial purposes.Other authors have done this and it has been very damaging for their reputation.This book is pure rubbish! By the way something some authors don't seem to grasp: a novel writer is DIFFERENT from a short stories writer and few brilliant ones can do both; the styles are definitely diverse, so each one should keep to their style."
2,give me a break,"Give me a break--or rather give Elizabeth George a break!! Yes, I Richard (don't know how to underline the title on e-mail) is somewhat disappointing to those EG groupies like myself who track and anticipate her newest novel with bloodhound-like (sorry) doggedness (I can't stop)--we're all complaining because this short story collection, which would have been heralded as clever, imaginative, timely (delicious in getting back at OJ Simpson!) if published by a new or au courant short story writer--is NOT what we were expecting. We only want approximately every two years an entirely new, convoluted plot, fascinating and familiar characterization, in depth research, and above all, that Anglophilic (is that a word??) Ambiance! Well, Elizabeth probably needed some time off and wanted a romp in the literary surf of southern CA before returning to those 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. days of writing, travels to England, etc. So just enjoy the stories for what they are--marvelously intriguing!"
3,Better than I expected!,"Unlike many of the readers, I found this book fun, ... These stories were mercifully short, and though the surprise endings might strike some readers as tacky, I thought they were fun. I confess I had to reread one story in part to understand the killer's motive, but despite that, there were more thrills here than I expected to find. George's introductions could have been shorter and more artful, but let's face it, she's not the mystery short story artist Ruth Rendell is, so that's not surprising.Lev Raphael ..."
4,Liked it,In general I am not fond of short stories. However Ms. George's stories have the appeal of her longer work and I would recommend this short collection.
1,A Powerful Disappointment,"Unlike her other books, this one seems to be an experiment that didn't work.I'm a diehard Elizabeth George fan. This particular book disappointed me in many ways. I could only complete one of the five stories, and can't recommend it to anyone.Will this stop me from buying her next novel? Not at all. She's a master in her field."
2,Disappointing,"As a great fan of Elizabeth George and her British mystery stories, I was very disappointed in these short stories. ... - the plots are weak and in one I failed to find a motive for the murder. I've only read 3 of the 5 stories - so maybe the next 2 will be better. Perhaps the short story is not her forte!"
4,Unusual,"This is quite unlike any book I've ever read. It is composed of 2 parts. The first is a rambling monologue from a decaying man (or is it woman or animal) named Molloy, in search of his mother. The second starts out as a detective named Moran in search of Molloy. In both stories nothing much happens involving any specific time or place, and the identities of all characters are in question. The only thing that really exists is the language, which turns out to not have much true meaning at all.Read this if you are looking for an unique style of writing to experience. Perhaps you will learn more about the nature of language and identity, or perhaps you will find it tedious and pointless, but all readers will agree it is experimental and unique."
5,Hawaiian Tropic Ozone Sunblock 70,I have purchased the above from Amazon before. I have used Hawaiiam Tropic Ozone Sublock 70 for 10 years. I am an outdoors person and am never without this product. I use it as a moisturizer and sunblock. I have very sensitive skin which has not burned or turned the slightest shade of pink since using this product. The fragrance is also delightful. Hawaiian Tropic Ozone Sunblock 70 is well worth the price.Lately it has been difficult to locate so I am grateful Amazon stocks it. Thank you Amazon and Hawaiian Tropic!
5,bueno,"As advertised and just what I needed. Be sure to check fit/application to your vehicle (AutoZone could not find the right part but thanks to the miracle of the internets and Amazon, I got the right parts). Easy to install and replaced a 20+ year old oem part."
4,Good Slim,"This is a later recording from the legendary pianist made for the German L & R label and now re-released on Evidence. The first nine songs are from a studio set feature Slim with a terrific band including Carey Bell on harmonica, Hubert Sumlin on guitar and Odie Payne on drums. These songs are the best on the CD as Slim and the band run through a set mixing slow blues with up-tempo songs, including several instrumentals. The last six songs are pulled from a series of live recordings that are decent but not spectacular.Overall, a fine showcase of this legend of blues and at the fairly good price it is worth the purchase."
3,Technology has moved on,The SIM card that goes in my current ATT phone is not compatible with this technology- therefore it is unusable.
2,Cell Phone Review,"This is exactly the phone I wanted, and was so happy to have found it. However, the #3 and #5 stick BAD!!! I did send email to seller, but no response. I am not very happy with the phone, and find it hard to believe that it was actually new if the number stick. Unfortunately all my number are 359 or 581 so difficult at best."
1,Do noy buy this,The cover is plastic.The signal reception is noty as good as it is mentioned in the reviews.I returned this item try another cell phone.
4,Great BASIC Phone,"I've had my 6010 for years. It just never breaks down, never locks up, never goes wierd. I've fallen back to it several times, once after my blackberry became quirky, and once with an international phone. Originally, I purchased a much more expensive spiffy phone with camera, bells and whistles. I brought it back to exchange for this phone failing to get a clear line. I live in a poor reception area. The sales person said the signal would be better and there would be less hassels. He was right. I can always depend on this little fellow. It doesn't look like much, but I am secure that my calls will happen when I want them to. This is a great back up, no headache phone."
3,simple and easy,the phone is great if you need a easy to do phone i just wish it was a little smaller to fit in my pants pocket better but its a good phone
5,"So, History really IS dead","I was overly suprised - and just a hint - the little preview clips you can find that make it look like it is a anime insert film, no, bad choice to post --- they are little (very little and few) story transitions for effect. I am even more impressed , that this was done on a budget -- the acting I felt was real and well done, the music score was outstanding, and the choice of film media and use of color filters made the entire film very rich and much depth for the eyes. Zombie make ups were also, just wonderful. Was not sure about a period piece zombie film but the move explained it and it was sensible and cohesive - so kudos to the writer(s)....the feeling you get during and after watching it -- is that you just traveled along with a man, that has found Hell come to earth and with it, brought all the demented and diseased souls of the dammned, to possess and wander about, in the bodies of the dead."
5,Exit Humanity Loved it!,"I really didn't expect this movie to be as good as it is.It really is beautifully done,with a lot of heart ,and still blood and guts .I really felt the lead actors pain and what he was going through.I also liked the different take on Zombies being this is happening during the Civil War era.The acting is very good,the locations beautiful.Definitely a must see for Zombie lovers."
1,Sloooooow,I like Zombie movies as much as the next person but this was painfully slooow. There is minimal to none in the zombie killing and Zombie attacks. The only thing good was the picture on the box.
5,Beyond the Zombie movies of today...,I was beyond impressed with this movie. The story along was well acted and well shot. This is a keeper for all history / horror watches.
2,Not bad seen a lot worse.,"Overall not a bad zombie movie, not a big budget but they did well with what they had. As far as zombie movies go, it worth the viewing as long as your not expecting a movie the caliber of Dawn of the Dead."
3,Pretty good overall,"Some of the acting and dialogue could have been better, but for a low budget zombie flick, this is much better than I had anticipated. The Civil War horrors meet a new kind of terror: zombies!"
3,Trailers looked great but just another so-so zombie move,Watched the Amazon Instant vid. The trailers really hooked me but I found the complete product to be pretty slow and the soundtrack was horrendous as I had to have the music irritateingly (is that a word?) loud just to barely hear the dialouge/narration. It was good enough to get through but I wouldn't add it to my collection unless I see it somewhere for a buck or two. Neat idea though.
3,little to long,"the story line is rich but it took to long to get any place, also we had to call customer care because charged me twice, but was fix right away."
4,I like it,"A low budget film,looks great,good music, an interesting take on the whole zombie genre.civil war meets Zombies. very enjoyable.Zombie films I watched recently and I strongly recommend.all different in style and story.JUAN of the Dead - I say the best Zombie film in 2012. I will watch it again soon with friends.Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies - The Asylum produced a really good Zombie film, I was surprised,its good."
2,EXIT SOME OF MY CASH,"I like small movies. Independent films. Quiet horror.When done well.This one almost - almost - fit the bill.There were decent make-up effects, some atmosphere, a novel placement for a zombie outbreak and even some good performances once we got past the over-wrought histrionics of the first chapter of the story. Sometimes less is more which would have been a good film editors suggestion, in this case.This isn't a really bad movie. With a little more effort, this could have been a special film. But, unless you're a friend of one of the individuals involved in this production, a die-hard zombie fan or feel 'Lizard Lick Towing' should be in the running for an Emmy and those darn ""Squatches are just too sneaky to ever let themselves get properly photographed, splashed like a deer on a bumper or leave tell-tale bone piles lying around, find yourself something else to watch.Sorry, didn't do it for me."
3,Movie,"I'm a huge horror fan. This had a complete storyline and dialogue which was pretty good. It wasn't much on the horror/gory side, so if you need the lighter end of horror this would work well. I enjoyed it, but if you are hard core this won't work for you."
1,Bloody Disgusting Selects?,"How did this flick get the ""Bloody Disgusting Selects"" insignia? What was ""bloody disgusting"" was the fact that this was the S-L-O-W-E-S-T zombie flick I've ever seen...I had to fast forward on a number of occasions. Every scene lasted three times longer than it should have. This could have been released as a 30-minute vignette...not 114 minutes. Don't get me wrong...it definitely had its high points but it was not a ""Bloody Disgusting"" zombie flick. This passes as PG for me. Deceptive trailers and advertising agitates me. ""Exit Humanity"" is definitely a film you may ""exit"" before it ends."
1,Awful,"This movie was just awful! Had potential but failed. Weak storyline, bad acting, and at points in the movie your watching a animated comic book."
4,king james large print bible,"I was very pleased with this Bible. It is large, but the type is so wonderful for those who struggle with small print. Makes reading and studying so easy. Would suggest this Bible for anybody needs the larger print."
5,King James Version indexed Super Giant Print,"I gave this Bible to our 95 years young friend for his Birthday. He wears glasses, but wan not able to read his bible that had regular print, but this Super Giant Print works GREAT for him. The bible is larger than most which makes it much easier for laying it on his lap while reading in his lift chair. We are very pleased with this Bible."
2,not leather bound,"I thought I had found the perfect gift. But what was shipped was not genuine leather bound. so I returned it for the genuine leather and got the exact same bible, labeled ""Black imitation leather indexed"". I see by the other reviews that this is supposed to be leather bound. Dissapointed but do not want to try a third time."
5,Good and Very Inexpensive,"This Bible is very inexpensive with truly giant print. It is not a small book, but it also isn't too big to carry with ease. The paper is very thin; yet, the print on one side doesn't interfere with reading the other. Those to whom I have given this Bible have found it so easy to read (after struggling with regular Bible print sizes). Since it is a regular King James Version (and not a 'New King James Version'), it still has the far more specific pronouns that are vital for properly understanding nearly all texts. Thee, thou, thine and thy are always singular in this version of the Bible, and ye, you and your are always plural. Bibles that don't use these archaic-sounding but easily learned pronouns give uncertain information in many thousands of texts.I highly recommend this particular Bible for its superior print."
5,Fantastic!!!,"Amazingly quick delivery. I ordered this item for my father as a surprise for Father's Day. In passing, he mentioned that he had had a hard time reading the small print from his current bible and trouble relocating scriptures, even with using a magnifying glass. My dad lives out of town, and couldn't wait to call me. He said that he loved it and couldn't wait to use it when participating in his bible study class! He said that he didn't even need to use his glasses to read it and loved the reference sections. Mom loved it too, was reading it while he was on the phone."
1,Not bonded leather as described,"This was the imitation leather bible, which can be purchased at Walmart or Kmart for $12.99. It was not the bonded leather which was described."
5,Giant Print King James Bible,The Bible is exactly what I wanted. It is well put together and is of a high standard. Thanks
2,wrong choice,Sorry I choose the wrong bible. After checking around and looking at some at my church I should have gotten Life Application Study Large Print KJV Tyndale. Is this one you have to offer? I didn't return it because I lost the paper work that came with the one I received so I started to use it. I can not rate it because I have now put it aside.
5,Angel Blessings: Cards of Sacred Guidance and Inspiration,I am grateful to Kimberly Marooney for sharing this Divine gift through herSelf.I am grateful to the Angels and their teachings here and hope that others will read these words and be encouraged to seek the wisdom contained in this oracle. It lovingly guides the small child self to the Divine Child Within.
5,Angel Blessings: Cards of Sacred Guidance and Inspiration,"I have other angel cards and have seen some of my friends sets but these are by far the best ones I've used. They are quite beautiful and instead of some obscure message, these cards show you a very clear path. These were truly inspired by Kimberly Marooney's angels."
5,Wonderful,"I have several decks of angel cards and this has quickly become the one I most use. I find the cards extremely accurate. The book and cards have helped me uncover things I needed to fix in my life. I would recommend this to anyone who wants an accurate angel reading, and help from the angels."
4,Still going 2 years later,"I don't normally do reviews, but I was recently thinking about this purchase and saw unfair reviews.I ordered it for my daughters August birthday party in 2010 and have used it for the next few years including just the other day in 2012, it still performs like a champ. For the few times I have used it, it takes about 40 minutes to set-up (with one other hand), and 20 minutes to take down and put away.Last party we sat 24 adults at 4 six person tables with 8 toddlers at two mini tables and everyone was comfortable.From other reviews I knew that it probably wouldn't work well in high winds so I have never tried. It has sat in the rain for a day or two and survived. Over the 2 years I have used it the only damage so far is a slight rip in the bag.As an affordable solution for bug and sun protection for a yearly family gathering in the yard, this is a solid purchase."
4,Fascinating and open-minded look at other faiths.,"Now it's probably unfair of me to rate and review this book, being that I do exactly read a lot of books about world religion. But I was taking the institue class and loved it. And while there are probably many a world religion book that goes into much great detail (how about deeply researching each faith separately?) this is an excellent introduction that goes over the basics of each major world faith. And always in a positive light. I liked the religions so much that I wasn't terribly fascinated by the LDS perspectives, but I suppose they were fairly nice to have around as they solidified the research. I had the most recent update of the book and I adored it. Even if you aren't LDS, this is a great research."
4,"great product, wrong color","The picture clearly shows yellow--and I got orange instead. With 5 people in my family, I was hoping to have 5 colors by ordering the set of 4 plus and an orange place setting. Now, 2 kids will have the same and probably fight. Also, only 1 mess kit bag came with the set of 4 place settings. All of the pieces will not fit in the single bag. Clearly, I am disappointed, but don't have time to return the set and get individual sets with bags in only the colors I needed."
2,Misled by advertisement,"I was under the impression that I was purchasing multiple balls. Only now have they changed the product description to state that it's only one ball. For the quality of the ball, the product is overpriced. Go to your local store and find a nerf ball instead."
2,It is a cheap foam ball that is overpriced,"I definitely would not recommend buying this ball (yes there is only one ball that you don't get to choose the color of). It is a cheap foam ball that costs much more than it is worth as it is just squishy foam with a thin rubberized layer over the top. So it is not durable, not water proof, and over priced. I would highly recommend purchasing something else."
1,No Bounce,FYI Before anyone else purchases. This ball does not bounce. It is made of foam and not good for a 17 month old. We needed a ball that bounced this size for the park. Seller needs to add this info to describtion.
4,Good mini basketball,"This is a small, foam basketfall so it might not be good for very young children since they could bite into it."
3,It did not last long,The product was not too sturdy and was damaged after a couple days of using it. Wish it was more sturdy.
1,product,"They advertised that they had the diamond product but didn't and just sent me another product w/out telling me. I got a full refund, however I was left with the product, They didn't want the items back...and I ordered SEVERAL bags."
5,Love it!,"I have a one year old daughter and I like to read Eric Carle's books for her. She loves it, as usual."
1,TINY!!!! Check the dimensions!,"Buyers, beware of the dimensions. This book is tiny. It is hardcover, but at a TINY 5""x4"" you cannot read this book to a whole classroom. Very disappointed when I received it to find out it was not full size. I love the story, though."
4,Eric Carle is a Master Author,Never read an Eric Carle book that I didn't like and think was perfect for a young reader. The colors are always bold and beautiful. His writing is simple and his stories engage the youngest of children. Buy this book and his others for your little reader.
1,"Don't buy this. If you did, return it. If you can't, recycle it.","We read books by the dozens with our preschooler. We've enjoyed many of Eric Carle's classic titles (The Very Hungry Caterpillar, Brown Bear) but this one is awful. It's highly inaccurate, from the empirical standpoint, and has nothing to do with how a seed germinates. Beyond that, it's horrendous. The other seeds suffer horrible deaths until only this one is left - it's more like Stephen King's The Long Walk than a preschooler book. 1984 is more cheerful.Carle has diluted his brand in a really awful fashion in recent years. Now he's jumped the shark."
3,Less than I expected,The story is cute and informative. Eric Carle's stories always are. But the tiny size of the book was unexepected.Too small for the second graders I bought it for. I would have preferred if the dimensions of the book were specified in the description of the product before i purchased it.
2,Mini book,"I ordered this book to read to my 2nd graders and I was a bit surprised when I saw that the book was only 4"" tall. A bit hard to read to a class when its a miniature book. Next time, make sure that the size is correct. The title being noted- MINI- like other sellers would have been helpful."
3,a very good movie,"Shiva is surprisingly a very good movie with good action and a very good story.I have never doubted that the Main Actor in this movie has very good potential in being a Big Actor one day, he has got the looks and most of all his acting is very good.Overall it is a very good movie, and don't judge the movie before you have seen it, I have and I loved it"
5,I Would Be Lost without It!!,"I have been using the Arrow Street Atlas' for years. I have NEVER been lost as long as I had one in the car. Whether for work or personal use, these maps are indespensable to anyone travelling in unfamiliar areas. I highly recommend them."
4,Psychedelic? I'll take it!,"This was one of the first lps I ever owned when I got it in 1968 as a 7th grader. I knew them because of the hit we Ain't Got Nothin' Yet, but when I saw the lp jacket I had to have it.Songs were shorter then than now, so Tobacco Road seemed like In-a-gadda-da-vida then, with 4 whole minutes of jammin' and yellin'. Their playing was superb, whether it was a tender ballad like Sometimes I Think About or rockers like Gotta Get Away.They showed so much more playing ability of that day than most other hit-makers, or bands who did stuff that passed for music. So why are moronic tunes like Wild Thing still getting more airplay than this little gem from the 60s? Despite the veiled reference to hallucenogenics on the front, you don't need no dope to enjoy this one."
5,"classic artifact from the era, 60s lovers need this one","i remember getting this during my big allmusicguide buying years, lol. being a lover of 60s, it was reviewed so well, i had to get it. this is great stuff. it's american garage psych, bluesy, and just wonderful to listen to. if you don't know the first track, it's a classic that would be on oldies stations when they were feeling daring. some of the stuff on here is just wonderful, sounds like a band that really liked playing together, had a great sound and captured it in the studio. if you love 60s, have either of the nuggets sets, or any of that stuff, then you'll probably really dig this."
5,Fantastic!,"For me, the sign of a good novel is one that I absolutely can't put down. Mr. Gleacher's book, an intriguing and funny look at what many go through in their confusing 20s, hooked me from the start. I love any book that willfully places the reader within its borders and I have no complaints with It's How You Play The Game. He is a charming, witty, and intelligent writer and I'll definitely pick up his next book as soon as it hits the shelves!"
4,Brilliant first effort,"I grabbed this book in the library based soley on its title and after reading the jacket synopsis, thought it sounded a bit like a male ""Bridget Jones"" and decided to give it a try. Am I glad I did! Jimmy Gleacher's debut novel is extremely well written with characters that are easy to relate to and identify in one's own life, a plot that isn't at all far fetched and a feel-good ending. A very engaging book that is difficult to put down and had me laughing out loud at certain parts. All in all, a brilliant first effort. I look forward to his future stories."
2,Great Book for the Year Written,"Good book, It is a great book for a beginner in the Child world. But I wouldn't recommend it to other parents"
2,Great Book for the Year Written,Good book but it doesn't follow behaviour based policies.It is a great book for a beginner in the SAFETY world. But I wouldn't recommend it to other safety professionals.
1,Never even got the cd!,"I put in a order for this cd,but never got it.How can I review it when I never got the music!"
4,Bawdy fun,"Lann is another of Thorne's lovely, bedhopping heroines. This time, the setting is a space fantasy: zap guns, space ships, and anatomically detailed robots. Our heroine is a dark haired super-spy in a lushly rejuvenated body. Her beat is the dark underside Altair-Main, which she prowls in her guise as dancer and performance artist of the intimate kind.The format resembles Thorne's Ghita: it centers on our top-heavy heroine, usually accompanied by her satyric greybeard, and grinning sidekick. The greybeard suffers a rejuvenation mishap and ends up as an aging lecher in a pre-adolescent body. The robotic sidekick is a specialist in unarmed combat - mostly because the arm keeps falling off.It's a amusing exploration of sexy end of the adventure/spy/babe genre. It stops short of being blatant porn, but sometimes goes well beyond believability of plot. If you have adult tastes and a sense of humor, there's a lot to like here.//wiredweird"
3,Early Chastain,"I'm a huge Chastain fan since the 80's. Seen them live back then, have all their albums. I was not familiar with Mystery of Illusion so when it became available on CD, I picked it up. I've put in on a few times and I just can't seem to get into it- it just doesn't grab me- maybe it's just the songs, maybe the production, I don't know. I LOVE Seventh of Never, Ruler of the Wasteland or Voice of the Cult- those three are awesome. So, if you're new to Chastain and want to be impressed, buy any or all of the three I just mentioned."
5,Basic PC Hardware Maintenance and Customization,"This book is more basic than the other hacks book. While the others cover offbeat issues around a topic this one offers straightforward solutions to every day problems. These including flashing your BIOS, adding more RAM or more power, dual booting and managing partitions. There are a few advanced topics thrown in, like overclocking and hacking startup performance.This distinction is relevant because I fear some buyers may not buy the book because the Hacks books are generally geared towards professionals. Not so in this case. I think this book is a practical purchase for anyone looking for DIY maintenance on a PC.If you are looking to build a new PC then be sure to check out O'Reilly's ""Building the Perfect PC""."
1,Overclocking CPU (Hack 21) at your own risk,"Overclocking CPU (Hack 21) is not as easy as adding more memory or upgrading the hard disk. If you have nothing to lose, you might think about overclocking the CPU. Manufacturers may not honor the warranty on an overclocked CPU. The modifications may also void the warranty on the motherboard and other components (such as video card & hard drives).To increase performance of your PC: I would first try to add more memory (Hack 30), and then try to replace the hard disk with a faster (& larger) one (Hack 58)."
1,BOOK WAS FALLING APART,"The book I ordered looked like it had already falled apart and was put back together. I thought well thats alright I'm recycling but as soon as I started using it, after a couple days the book fell apart! The book was put back together in the worst way."
1,boring,don't buy unless you wanna cry (of boredom) same subject for 15ish chapters over and over and over and over and over and over. Get it?
1,never received the item,"The seller was contacted, but gave no response. Seller kept the money and never sent the book."
4,TRULY EMERGENCY-CHANNELLED,"""Current Emergency Diagnosis and Treatment"" is an ideal reference text, which provides timely information for both inpatient and ambulatory monitors.This book is full of valuable advice on how to handle both trauma and non-trauma emergencies. It is versatile: with improved sections on paediatrics and cardiology.The ease with which one finds information in this book shows that its structure is truly emergency-channelled. It is an important text whose timely information would benefit both doctors and patients. But, I must add that its handling of chemical pathology fell short of my expectation."
4,A Catalogue of Timeless Classical Art,"This volume represents just a fragment of the art on display at the Greece and Rome exhibit in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York). But the selections (165 of them) are wisely chosen and the explanatory notes accompanying the photos are very illuminating. All in all, this catalogue of timeless classical art will be a wonderful souvenir for those who have been there and it will be a good gift for someone who has yet to witness this magnificent collection first-hand."
2,"worked for a little, starting to fail","bought these back in early november to replace my old worn out injectors and they worked great, but now these ones are already starting to die. same company i ordered my throttle position sensor and its dead too. My ecu gave me the check engine codes for both plus i can hear the extra gas dripping into my exhaust system. Now i have to go buy new ones. very disappointed."
1,Metal is way too soft to serve its purpose,"I bought this Ball joint tool in order to help me in changing my car's suspension but the metal it is built from is so soft that it did not serve any purpose and the fork bent right away and it was going to cut through the rubber seals around the ball joints that it was supposedly designed to protect. For tools like that, unless you are definitely certain about its quality and right size, it is better to purchase them from your local store so that you could exchange right away in case it is defective etc."
4,Commercial Quality Bench,"I purchased this bench through the manufacturers website for 299.00 with the power rack for 449.00 and $43 total shipping.The bench is commercial quality. It's weight capacity is great for even advanced lifters (600lb capacity). The bench I purchased does not fold up as seen in this picture and like I said I received mine directly form the manufacturer. The bench declines and inclines.The incline I do not personally like. I feel that the incline puts you too far backward under the bar and forces you to lower the bar to and from the bottom of your chest rather than the middle at the nipple line. Because of this it makes it hard to use for incline. For flat bench, this product is fantastic. It truly is commercial quality as is all of powertec's products.If you are looking for a home bench press with commercial quality I highly recommend this bench. However if you plan on working with the incline press I recommend searching for something different."
5,great set,"Put it together in about 30 mins and works great. Good for incline, decline and bench - the rear squat weight holder is a little awkward, but it works when needed. Would buy again, but would have gone to Dick's Sporting Goods first. Had the same set, PLUS the leg extension ($80 add-on) for $20 less total ...."
2,......,"... wow um this game, well how do i put this... oh yes sucked. I beat career mode in 4 hours. noting cool a huge let down. it copied fast and furious Tokyo Drift. cars were a real disappointment. the controls confused the heck out of me, and why on earth did they get rid of the look back control??? very poor quality"
2,Uugghh! : (,"All I have to say is Uugghh! This game is not what I imagined. If you want a NFS game, buy Most Wanted, not this one. This game didn't have much effort put into it. The graphics are horrible, and most every turn looks the same. The story is mediocre, but most everything else is Uugghh! :( NFS creators put hardly any effort into this one. Once again, get NFS: Most Wanted, or wait for the next version, NFS: Pro Street. This game is a waste of money. It is a pathetic effort by the game designers' part. I am extremely disappointed. I had expected better, way better."
5,kept me reading,"As a 6th year college senior, I've found ways over the years to skim around text books and still ace classes. I've read this text cover to cover, however. Ms. Claudia Cuddy's writing allows you to learn actively on your own. The copy is not a chore to read; once you get into a chapter, the text practically reads itself! Also, Ms. Cuddy's zest for the subject comes across with many tips and witty rhymes that literally make it difficult NOT to learn the material. The author's passion becomes contagious to the reader. Basically, a college student using this text will leave the course as an unstoppable publication designing machine- wielding the Quark program as a professional weapon of success."
3,Decent,"This is a good accompaniment to a hands-on confined space course. The only real way to learn the topic is frequent, thorough, professionally instructed, hands-on training. The book works well as a reference in this setting. It is simply not possible to learn the topic from this book alone. Good as a reference, but only applicable to those in a confined space course."
4,A great book!,This book was the first I have ever read by Linda Nichols. You will not regret buying this book. It kept my interest from the moment I picked it up. Definately a good read.
3,Entertaining version of classic comic strip,"Lighter in tone that the grim, conservative, but always gripping comic strip by Harold Gray on which it is based, this is Little Orphan Annie lite. For the real thing, buy the reprints from Fantagraphics or follow the original strip in Comics Revue magazine."
5,Kinda confused,"This is second order, second time box ripped open prior to receiving fromDHL forwarded to USPS, something not correct. Samples not in good shape."
5,Beautiful,These tea cups and saucers are a match to my dinnerware. They are the same fine quality and design. Lovely!
5,Excellent Book,"This is tops on my list of health advice. It is very difficult to follow this but, basically it espouses personal responsibility for one's health. That is so different than our current medical opinion in this time which puts the responsibility for our health on the medical profession. While I would not recommend ignoring certain health issues, I would recommend taking responsibility on day to day issues."
3,Irish folktales,"This book (which is actually ""The Wondersmith and His Son""), which is a collection of old Irish folk-tales about a man, known as the Gubbaun Saor, who could do wonderous things, and his daughter and adopted son, was a 1926 Newbery Honor book (i.e., a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best contribution to American children's literature."
3,Only if it is a DVD...,"If it is not for the sound quality (it's mono not stereo I suppose), I would rate it 5 stars. Actually I have the VHS video of this concert and I've been looking for the DVD or LD version of it for their far superior A/V qualities, but so far I didn't find either. One day I was just browsing in a CD shop and this CD caught my attention at once and I took it without hesitation. Well, it's exactly the copy of my VHS tape, just without the video part. When I was listening I could even view the visions in my brain (that funny gestures of Steve Howe and Carl Palmer). If it is a DVD I would give it 5 stars but it's a CD and the sound quality is ..... so I give it 3."
2,A Great Lost Opportunity!,"In 1983 the tension between Steve Howe and John Wetton, ended when the bassist was sacked from the band. He was replaced by Greg Lake(Still in Top Form!) to play a MTV's show for Japanese Television. This short lived incarnation of Asia: Howe,Wetton,Downes and Lake, played one gig only and short after Lake leave the band because ""it was too poppy for him"".This Tokyo's gig was released on Video as ""Asia in Asia "" , and here for the first time is release on CD format. Sadly the shine quality of the performance (Showing the versatility of Lake's voice to sing a Wetton's songs) is obscured by a poor quality recording adding the almost inexistent information in the record's booklet. It is a lost great opportunity to make a descent job on one of the most interesting piece of Asia's history."
3,Songs=great sound = fair,"I love the Stray Cats. I love Rockabilly. I hate it when you buy a CD which sounds like a guy in the audience is taping the concert with a hand-held recorder. About 3/4 of the way through, for some reason the sound really cleans up. I just wish the whole CD was as clean sounding as the end part. I'd give this CD 5 stars but the sound quality hurts my rating."
2,Am I missing something,The DVD that comes with this book is simply a slide show. Imagine my surprise I thought I would be able to view a movie of the information. I think it was misleading.
4,Opus Magnus,"When writting this book, Dr. Rouse put a lifetime of research and studies on the Indians of the Caribbean into one work.Since Rouse is considered the ""Dean of Caribbean Archaeology"", this book is a ""must have"" for anyone interested in the region and its native inhabitants.Very few people have worked for so long, in so many locations and with such dedication as Dr. Rouse."
4,Interesting and informative book on the Tainos,"Very interesting and informative book on Tainos. As a Puerto Rican, I was curious to know more about the Taino who inhabited the island before Columbus' arrival. It's obvious the author has spent much time thoroughly researching the issue on Tainos. However, although the title of the book leads one to believe the main focus is on the Taino themselves, a lot of the book is spent theorizing and hypothesizing about the Tainos' Caribbean ancestors and predecessors with explanations of pottery works and other items found in archeological digs. I was expecting something different, such as a more detailed account of day-to-day Taino social norms, culture and history. Some of that information is included in the book, but not as much as I would have liked, and I suspect not much is known about it anyway. Even so, it was still very interesting and am glad to include this book as an addition to my personal little library at home."
5,Didn't want it to end,"This book is great. Very informative and well written. I learned a great deal about my cultue, heritage and ancestry. It left me with a thirst for more."
3,Little pricey lens holder,"The product arrived on time. My new 70-300mm SOny Lens fit fine in this bag. A cool feature is the bottom of the bag is much larger than the radius of the lens. So there is enough room to keep the lens hood attached.Other than the bag should be a few bucks cheaper, it meets my needs."
2,Beautiful but unstable,"The stacking tables are very easy to assemble, real beautiful to look at and stack perfectly. However, they are not very stable because of only three legs. They really needed better support. Perhaps they should have eliminated the bottom shelf & added the fourth leg.This flaw is too serious to recommend thisd purchase."
4,Exciting Historical Fiction,Another great story by Martha. Best for late middle grade or early young adult. Martha's lyrical style and personal knowledge of the subject brings the story to life.
5,Madaleine L'Engle is now my favorite author.,"When I first read ""A Wrinkle in Time"", I was totally suprised. My friend had recommended this book to me. After I finshed, I realized I had to read ""A Wind in the Door"". Meg and her dear friend Calvin battlie a second time to save her little brother Charles Wallace. Whew! This book was great and I am looking forward to reading many more of her books!"
4,Sequel to A Wrinkle in Time with Charles-Wallace and Meg,"This book is the sequel to A Wrinkle in Time. Charles-Wallace is very ill. His mother, Dr. Murray is a noted biochemist and is desperately trying to research a new, mysterious disease and Charles-Wallace may have it.When Charles-Wallace announces ""There are dragons in your vegetable garden"" this is the start of a great adventure that is connected to Dr. Murray's research, Charles-Wallace's illness and of course, much more.This is a good tale about rebellion and the maturation process, and about the seductive powers of Evil. As usual, L'Engle mergers moral subjects into pure fantasy with her skilled writing and wonderful characters."
2,Only slightly better than the first.,"I just do not understand why everyone thinks these books are so great. I've now read the first two to my daughter, and while she liked the first one, her interest diminished in this second one. I thought that this one would be better than the first, because the first half of the book had a story that seemed to be developing really well. Then they started traveling through space and size and it stopped making sense. There's no explanation as to why Sporos must deepen, or why the teacher is teaching these particular humans, or why the echthroi do what they do. The only thing that's clear is that these particular humans must do something right away or the universe will collapse. Like the first book, there is very little character development and the plot is overly simplistic. Thankfully I've convinced my daughter to switch to the Chronicles of Narnia for our reading time, and I'm hoping she forgets this series so that I don't have to come back to it."
3,Not as good as the others,"Among the first three books of the Time Quartet, this one is the weakest. The plot is not as neat as those of the other two, and it got tiresome towards what was supposed to be the climax. Although Madeleine L'Engle does a characteristically good job of establishing atmosphere, she failed to hold my attention, starting with the unlikely and unexciting first trial where Meg Murry had to identify the real Mr. Jenkins from among three lookalikes. And while the themes are excellent, as always, the way they were translated into words, in this book, leaves much to be desired. The first few chapters are very interesting, but towards the end, the book is a disappointment."
2,"Foggy, semi-ethical sci-fi tale","I certainly would not recommend this book for children or young adults -- it's just too weird and I can't define any worthwhile message(s) that this book would convey to a young person (which appears to be the author's purpose).It's all about a girl who worries constantly about her sick brother and a talking snake (among other entities which appear later) comes along and sort of helps her through the crisis to make him well again. The tale gets a bit technical, which I feel takes away from the fantasy of what might have been an okay story.Sci-fi is supposed to be weird and surreal sometimes but I seized upon a distinct impression that L'Engle may have been puffing a little too much reefer when she wrote this one. I really suffered to finish this one, but I finally made it through to the end.See my listmania lists for superior choices."
3,A Great Sci-Fi Fantasy Novel,"The Wind In The Door is a great read for anyone who loves to read fantasy books with a touch of science. Madeline L'Engle has done it again, writing the second book in the Wrinkle In Time Series.In the story, Meg Murry(the main character) and her friend Calvin O'Keefe go on a journey to save Meg's younger brother(Charles Wallace)from a strange sickness, thought to be caused by Echthroi(evil beings)in Charles Wallace's mitochondria(energy cells). They travel through space to find answers, meeting a Cherubim(a creature with wings and many eyes)who follows and helps them on their journey.This book is a great book because it combines fantasy with reality. The descriptions of the scenes in the book are detailed, it is almost like the reader is the character.Reading The Wind In The Door will leave you searching for more."
3,I liked A Wrinkle in Time better,"A Wind in the Door just did not match the adventure and wording that A Wrinkle in Time did. The plot was that Meg (the main character), Charles Wallace(Meg's younger brother), and Calvin (Meg's ""close friend"") stumble onto a huge problem with the principal of the school and a ""drive of dragons"" and even the evil of absolute nothingness. Although I liked the plot and all, I had a hard time understanding it and picturing what was going on. I liked most of the characters and the lands they go to were interesting but I still think that if it was just a bit easier to read I would have enjoyed it more and sometimes having characters that are so smart makes me feel stupid."
4,A Wind in the Door is a Good Book,"A Wind in the Door is an intresting story featuring Meg and Charles Wallace who find dragons. They have a few problems with the main dragon, whose name is Prognoskes. He helps Meg and Charles Wallace throughout the story. Although the beginning is rough and slow, the story gets better every word. Mr. Jenkins, the principal, is a good addition especially when he has clones. The ending is interesting and odd. They argue about how the door got opened. It leaves a sensation of wanting more of it to read, more in the middle of your mind."
4,A Windy Adventure,"I must say, when I started reading this book, I wasn't expecting it to be good. I find that the rule where the second novel is not as good as the first is completely true. However, I was thoroughly impressed that Madeline L'Engle managed to provide interest. Both Meg and Charles Wallace have grown up a great deal and they are more responsible. Charles Wallace becomes sick and Meg and Calvin along on another adventure together. The story was slow at parts, but it moved along. People who do not like science whatsoever should not read this book. There was a bit too much mitochondria and farandolae for me."
4,amazingly imaginative journey through the micro-cosmos,"Meg's little genius brother, Charles Wallace, is having trouble fitting into first grade, and Meg is having trouble letting him grown into his own. She's also having trouble with Mr. Jenkins, her little brother's principal, who seems to have two evil twins. Meanwhile, Charles Wallace is turning more and more sickly. Meg, in a journey through the macro and micro cosmos, must discover her purpose as well as sort out her emotions and feelings. L'Engle's genius series deals with a brand new form of mythology, that of quantum physics. It's beautiful and wondrous. Grade: A"
1,Wasn't pleased....,"I have read all 4 books in the ""Time quartet"" and this, BY FAR, is the worst. I mean it isn't the most horrible garbage in the world, it just isn't much of a story. I can only say read it yourself before you make decision!"
1,Pretentious and fake - spiritual,"I really, really tried to like this book... but it has so many pretentious twists in the plot, made up concepts and faux spirituality, that it left me shaking with anger."
1,HATE IT,"HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO US MADELINE L'ENGLE!!!!wORST BOOK EVER, DON'T READ IT, THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY. DON'T LISTEN TO ANYTHING ANYONE ELSE SAYS! it's ugly and dumb"
1,better than Harry Potter,"mildly amusing. to many made up words. found the main characters unlikable, virulent, and egotistical. how did they get small enough to go into one of Charles Wallace's mitochondrion? yes they use the wrong tense throughout the whole book! basically a dud by a good writer."
5,Awesome even thirty-odd years later,"I re-read this as one of my sons is discovering L'Engle. It was just as unusual and involving as it was when I read them in fifth grade. Truly well-written YA fiction, with angst, an outsider protagonist, epic battle between good and evil... and written in the sixties!"
5,Amazing,It was amazing because I expected less than what I really got.Madeleine L'engle is a great author.The time quinet Series is a good series.
3,Somewhere between 'Fantastic Voyage' and 'Hair',"I guess I enjoyed this. I think. I really enjoyed, ""A Wrinkle In Time' and was excited about getting back to Meg, Calvin, and Charles. But this definitely echoed my previous sentiments, and actually magnified them, that these books feel so post Woodstock psychedlic fantasy trip. This time Meg and Calvin enter an alternative cosmos and actually attempt to save Charles life by going inside him with the help of some new friends, A passage involving Meg reads, ""She was being consumed by flame. She sensed a violent jolt to the cosmic rhythm, a distortion of wild disharmony-""An example like this makes me wonder how the intended young adult reader is grasping , this and it's deep concepts. I'm sure part of the success of the book(s) are that they work on many levels for both adults young and old, I just found this a bit esoteric even for hard core fantasy fans, let alone young people."
4,Love the writing but not my favorite L'Engle story.,"This book is well worth the read, especially if you are reading the quintet in order. My kids and I (7,8,9) enjoyed it as I read it aloud at bedtime! I absolutely love her writing and imagery!"
5,My favorite book,"I first read this book when I was a pre-teen. I'm now 27 and I can still say it is my favorite book. It treats the themes of good and evil brilliantly. I continue to go back to it, to help me make sense of the world. Yes, a children's book is that deep! Even though I enjoyed it when I was younger, I couldn't withdraw all the meaning that I do now. It has wonderful messages: to adapt and remain yourself; to love even those with faults; to find out what it is you were meant to do. Plus, we deal with the 3 main characters from Wrinkle and pick up some new ones along the way. Thank you, Madeleine L'Engle!"
2,I Feel As Though I Should Have Liked This Book More,"I've read this book twice. When I read this as a kid, I got very confused once Meg and everyone is inside Charles Wallace's body, but I don't remember much else of my reaction.Upon reading this as an adult, I enjoyed the book, but it wasn't all that this series was hailed to be. Out of the four books (A Wrinkle in Time, A Swiftly Tilting Planet, Many Waters, and A Wind in the Door), Many Waters is quite the best, and A Wind in the Door is the one I would least recommend."
3,A confusing but captivating piece,"This book was a bit more confusing, with the going inside Charles Wallace's body and kything and the ""dragon"" cherubim. I still enjoyed it, but she took a big risk with making this one a super spiruital deep one."
4,Does it live up to the legand?,"In this book, a year has past since a wrinkle in time happened. This book is about charles wallace being very sick. It's a little confusing at some points, but at others, it's amazing what the charicters can do.If you loved a wrinkle in time, you may not like this one as much. But it still lives up to the legand!"
4,Cool Book!,"A WIND IN THE DOOR is really good. The characters are great. My favorite character is Meg, a twelve year old girl. She has a dog named Fortinbras. This book really drives you into the story. For science fiction this is a good book. If you like science fiction with a twist of fantasy read this book!"
2,I can't download this book onto my Kindle even though I can download the other 3 in the series??!?,"I think this is an excellent book, as well as the series being great; however, after purchasing my new AmazonKindle, I discovered that I could download the ""A Wrinkle in Time"" series Volumes I, III and IV, but not Volume II - ""A Wind in the Door"". How does that make any sense at all? I am extremely frustrated about this."
2,"I enjoyed the book , but it was hard to understand.","I enjoyed this book called "" The Wind in the Door.""The book starts out in the twins'garden. The whole book is based on three people, Meg, Calvin and a cheribum. The conflict of this book is to save Charles Wallace. His sister tries to complete the two tasks before the faradolae stop deepening and singing the joyful song to the stars and the heavens. If the faradolae do not deepen and sing the joyful song, Charles will die. It is full of action , but hard to follow."
4,A rather confusing book.,This book shoud not be read lightly.It has thick detail yet very interesting plot.I had fun reading it.I think no one under nine shoud read this.
4,Fantasy at it's Height,"This book was very entertaining and exciting. The characters were obviously make believe but they were described so well and given so much human characteristics that you believed in them. You believed they were real. Also the adventures that they ahd were oviously not real but they were so not real they were enjoyable, and the author did an excelent job making them seem as real as they could be. All around this was an outstanding book."
5,another WWII book that is one of the Best!!,"I read a ton of WWII books and this is one of the best. My grandfather fought in the war and he was part of L-Company. I bought him a copy of this book and he couldn't put it down, and said it was totally accurate and that he remembered a lot of stuff. Don't wait on this book. Stop reading this review and go and buy this book."
4,Another very good war chronicle,"Mr. Khoury manages to describe the entire experience from training to coming home in a plain, down to earth fashion with just the facts and no embelishment. No glory, no baloney, just the facts. That said, you still can feel the heart that he put into it. Only someone who has been there and experienced the sometimes helpless feeling of the very real possibility of never going home again can describe it in this manner. You can't say it like that without having been a ""Dog Face"". Our combat veterans can't get enough recognition for what they have done for us. Those WW II vets may not look like much today, but back then they were real warriors defending our freedom. They still deserve an ""Atta Boy""."
3,Interesting account,Good read interesting account of one man's service to our country in world war two . Good to read a book about a lesser known unit.
5,A good read. Down to the foot soldier viewpoint,"Since I'm a big fan of WWII history books, this book was easy to choose. I thought it was well-written and interesting. The stories the author tells gives the reader a look at the life and times of an average WWII foot soldier in the US Army. And gives you a taste of what they experienced."
1,Another trite sales book,"Another run-of-the-mill sales book, lacking in depth and originality. Not even Todd's best effort, The Power to be Your Best was his best book."
1,Don't read books that are self serving - no trust here!,"Ok - a few nuggets - very few. What annoys me most are books that are written to promote the authors business. They're self serving and never provide a full ""how to"" guide.I'm curious - were the other reviewers relatives of the author?"
5,Holistic approach to successful selling,"I'm a fan of this book because it is one of the few that takes a well-rounded approach to selling and doesn't ignore the characteristics and values that are necessary in the individual who wants to be successful in sales. It's not just a book about how to close or how to influence or how to make your product appealing--while techniques are thoroughly discussed, the main premise of this book is that everything in sales is easier when you build ""high"" trust.I don't quite understand the two disappointed comments about the title not fitting the content. I think it's pretty straightforward. High Trust Selling is defined by Duncan as the combination of (1)becoming a trustworthy salesperson and (2)running a trustworthy sales business. The book is divided into two sections: the first seven chapters are about becoming a trustworthy salesperson and the final seven chapters are about building and running a trustworthy sales business. Makes perfect sense to me."
2,Trust & Value: key to modern selling,"I agree with Mr. Duncan that trust and value are important elements in today's skeptical business climate. I was eagerly awaiting to read his definition of high trust and how to establish value - neither of which I found in the book. Rather the first part is mainly ""pump you up"" motivation typical of motivational speakers and the second part outlines his four step approach to selling. Just saying it is high trust does not engender high trust. He begins the book saying money isn't everything, yet in all of the success stories that permeate the book, money is the top gauge of success. All of the success illustrations avoid naming companies, industries or products. The one saleswoman who reduced her client base from 60 to 12 clients and sold $80 million in one year was a little hard to believe. I was very disappointed."
2,Wasn't impressed,"Not as good as other work by this author. Ideas were not new, but a decent read nonetheless."
2,"Dressed up in ""high trust"" clothing","This book provides ideas that could help you sell more effectively, particularly if you are just beginning in sales. If you've read a lot of sales or management books, though, you will already be familiar with many of the ideas it presents.In my opinion, the book title is misleading. This book reads like it was originally named Fourteen Laws for Better Sales before the publisher decided to boost sales by renaming it. The author seems to feel that if he sprinkles the words ""high trust"" throughout the text, then that's what the book is about. It's really not.In High Trust Selling, Todd Duncan offers standard advice on selling dressed up in ""high trust"" clothes. But he does not really place the sales cycle in the context of the principles we advocate in the TrustBuild Program. If you need an introduction to selling or a review of basic principles, you might want to buy this book. Otherwise, there are better choices.Robert ReedPresidentTrustBuild"
3,The Hamptons from the view of a summer person.,"This is a real beach book. It is set on the beaches and villages of the East End of Long Island, mostly in the celebrity ridden Easthampton village. The protagonist is a descendent of the original settlers who thinks of himself as a local. He is really just a summer person who has contempt for the people who really live and work on the East End. The female character, Lady Dunraven is a one dimensional cartoon version of a woman as are many of the local people. The murder mystery, however is good and moves quickly. It is a pretty good choice for a beach read or to read on the Jitney on your way to The Hamptons."
2,FURTHER LANE ISN'T FAR ENOUGH AWAY FOR ME,"I grew up in New York and often spent summers in the Hamptons so I thought this would be a fun romp for me through my old stomping grounds with some moviestar names thrown about. Not only was this book tedious; it was DULL. It reminded me of Sander's McNally series but instead of Palm Beach, Florida as the setting, we have the Hamptons.....another place where old money or lack of old money rules. While Beecher Stowe and Alix Dunraven have some promise, the story didn't. I bought this book based on a People Magazine recommendation that it would be a ""good summer read."" It wasn't."
5,Fun anywhere,"This is a great product! Very well made, cute, and durable. Though my 4 year old hasn't quite mastered the rules of hopscotch, she loves setting up the mats and jumping on the numbers. She's learning her numbers and working on her balance at the same time. It's perfect indoor exercise for the winter months. We can't wait to take it outside in the spring!"
1,Find at local bookstore and make sure your model is covered,"I ordered and received it quickly only to find that not every model from 1963-2000 as the title implies is covered. I have a '99 Buick Century and wouldn't you know it, the CD only had up to 1998!"
1,Another bit of magical thinking,"I have suffered from depression for many years, and have done yoga on and off for that period. I have never had more than temporary relief of symptoms after yoga. Sure, if you want to do yoga for 8 hours a day, you might get more out of it. The author fails to realize that depression is a heterogenous condition, and as such, she offers false hope to some. It is interesting how various healing techniques become a 'religion' to those who find it helpful. I have been helped with nutrition and medication, but I'm not writing a book suggesting that others follow my path because I have found the way."
1,Misrepresented,"This book was misrepresented, neve once did they let known that this was a new age book. Also hard to read and you needed to be a professional to use there therory. They also stated you could not do this yourself, you need a professional to apply. Poor choice !"
1,the power to change comes from ones self - not in the heavens,I expected a more pure yoga approach to this most serious subject; depression. Some depression is caused by physical problems therefore I expected more YOGA positions; healing the body thus setting the stage to clear the mind. Finding the answers to problems of the mind is difficult enough without diverting the process in non reality based solutions.
1,More Poor Quality Blue Note Digital Transfers,Another terrible digital transfer from Blue Note totally ruins this classic album.Poor quality for such great music. These artists and their listeners deserve better!
2,beware,Bought this item a while aback and fell in love with it. Unfortunately it only lasted a month before the chain to the side fell out. It appeared as though it had rusted and broken off. For a beautiful watch it became more or less worthless even before I could show it off. Probably my most disappointing buy to date.
4,That's Entertainment!,"Looking for a good story with interesting characters and a fast moving plot? Check this one out. It's one of those that you can't put down, and are sory when it's over. Never heard of the author, but I hope he continues to write. I'm a fan. You will be, too!"
2,Not what I expected,"This book was not in great condition, did not have the book cover, the hard cover was worn and not in good shape and the book itself had stains on the pages"
2,Hard to follow - fragmented,This book is good only if you have a bible also. It references so much of the bible that it is difficult to interpret the pages. Also does not flow and is fragmented.
2,reprinted cd,we ordered a tracy lawerence cd when we received it was a bad reprint it was not listed as reprint and the cd's case was crushed
5,My son absolutely loves this,"From the images, this is a different packaging of Sing along read along. Only difference is that it doesn't comes with the booklets in sing along read along.Sing along read along was the first Leapfrog DVD I've gotten for my 2 years old son and he is obsessed with Leapfrog since then. He will say ""frog, frog"" daily and point to where the DVD is or trying to on the DVD player.This DVD is different from the other Leapfrog DVD. This contains short stories about Al, Og, Meg, Izzy, Gus and with quite a few short songs. Perfect for young children who is not interested in 30 stories with only two to three 3 mins songs."
2,Not the greatest.,I teach kindergarten and use Leap Frog videos frequently. This one is not one of my favorites. I would suggest any of the others before buying this one.
2,a very bad dvd transfer,This could have been a great B movie but it was let down by a very poor quality (sound and image) and i am rather upset about it so sometimes price can tell what you might expect from the product.MY ADVICE DON'T BUY IT UNTIL A GREAT COPY IS AVAILABLE.
1,Didn't like it.,I like the old movies but I did not like this one. I'm a fan of Vincent Price but not this movie.
3,"possibly, a vincent price fan only film","if your a vincent price fan i think you will enjoy this early film of his that has not been available in a studio quality release until now, its an early development of his evil, bad guy role with some interesting twists, {the only quality release is 20th centurys film noir release,thats the version you want to buy}, **** warning: all other releases by any other companys are so bad on quality they are unwatchable, i bought two versions from 2 other companys and had to throw the discs into the trash, thats how bad the visual and sound was. *** consider yourself warned !!!"
3,Not as Shock-ing as the title,"I guess the title loses a little something in the translation of time over 60 plus years. ""Shock"" really refers to the treatment that the metal patient undergoes in the story (rather than something that ""shocks"" the audience- which is what the title would infer today). Being a fan of Fox Film Noir, I kind of knew what I was getting into when I bought the DVD. I mainly bought this because I was curious about other films that Lynn Bari made (other than the musicals which I was familiar with including, ""Hello Frisco Hello"" and my favorite, ""Sun Valley Serenade""). Yes, this film is a bottom of the double feature bill sort of movie but enjoyable nonetheless. Vincent Price is not yet the ""Vincent Price"" we have come to know and love in the horror genre but entertaining and certainly charming in his Vincent Price sort of way. I bought this DVD on sale and I would recommend that you also buy it when it is on sale."
3,Stop starting series!,"I really wish DVD companies will stop starting series like Fox Film Noirand then abandon the concept midway.""Shock"" is a good addition to the series. But then Fox abruptly stopped it.Shame on you, Fox."
4,Pulp Noir,"I debated whether to give this film three or four stars. It doesn't to my mind qualify as noir more like pulp fiction. It's watchable but by no means classic. I give ""Shock"" the pass because of the superb performance by Vincent Price. Yes, his Dr. Cross commits some horrific things in the film. Essentially though he is a decent, albeit weak, man driven to these acts through events out of his control namely his comely head nurse(Lynn Bari). Don't expect the Price of the Grade Z horror films that he later churned out. This is a performance of great understatement and depth. I don't think that the film's primary setting, Price's sanitarium, was fully exploited for it's chill factor. What did get my spine tingling was it's portrayal of archaic psychotherapy namely the insuline shock treatments Price administers to the G.I.'s wife (Anabel Shaw) in his efforts to silence her."
4,A shock to the system,"Another one of the mid 1940's film noir examples. Vincent Price play the doctor with evil intent. After murdering his wife, he has the chance to do in the only witness to his crime. Will he or not? This is not a classic by any means, but Vincent Price is always fun to watch. This is a good example to watch from the period if you are unfamilar with it. It is also good if you are familar because this is not all that well known. Either way it is worth a watch."
2,Didn't last long,"We received this as a gift about 10 months ago. It worked beautifully until the plastic housing and piece of metal inside the head sheared off. It is a part that is not repairable so it is essentially trash. We have owned four different brands of this same style of ""rabbit ear"" wine pull and this had the shortest life span by far. Extremely disappointed!!"
5,Python,This snake was of excellent quality.The information they sent with the snake was enough to get kids to want to go and learn more.
1,Not delivered,"I would like to have read the book to write a review. Unfortunately it was never delivered, despite de pre-payment."
3,Some interesting interpretations,"Pros, I like how he discusses it sentence by sentence of the dream. Cons, I don't always agree with his views and think the book would be so much better if a panel of people discussed it instead of one. Just ok read. Not inspirational or thought provoking-except a few times."
3,Product for different model mac than in photo,"It's a really nice little keyboard protector, but in the image it's cleary on a 4g, pre-unibody PowerBook or MacBook pro. When I got it, it didn't fit my old keys... :("
1,Be forewarned.....,"I received this key guard yesterday and wanted to warn potential buyers so they would not make the same mistake as I did. The protector seems to fit over the keys fine but with excess space between the keyboard protector and the keys. The keys are barely visible because the material used is NOT clear. I cannot recommend this product, it is probably the worst key protector out their. Don't wast your money on this one, pay the extra cash and get something like the the one Apple sells at their store like the Moshi ClearGuard which I had on my last MacBook pro 17"" mid 2009 unibody. This one is going in the trash...!"
3,This item is not so bad!,"I ordered this cover, along with a cover from another carrier and this version is MUCH better than the other. Th item came in the expected time. It was clean (as the over looked possibly used). Also this one is a better fit to the keys as well. I do not think many of them will be the exact fit for under $20, however this product is a decent fit with just a small amount of air space. I would order this item again as long as the price does not exceed $2 if I could not afford the brand through MAC. However, when I am able to I plan to get the MAC version because I believe it may be closet to a perfect fit coming from their personal manufacturer choose. If you do not have the $25+tax for the MAC version, I would recommend this carrier."
4,It works! MacBook Pro keyboard protector,"I thought initially I would not like the feel of something between my fingers and the keyboard, but the silicone works well. Personally, I prefer the feel of silicone vs. the smooth keys. It even has the F & J key marked so your fingers can feel they are on the right key. It does keep crap out of your keyboard and it is easily cleaned by just running it under water."
3,I thought it was for early 2008 mac pros...,"Wrong size and wrong type, doesn't really fit the keyboard but still usable. Just need to get used to the fact that it doesn't quite fit, but it serves the purpose of protecting my computer from food and other elements. Would be 5 stars if it was the correct size for early 2008 macbook pro... oh well."
5,keyboard cover keeps things out of keyboard,"Just needed to keep crumbs and dust off my macbook pro keyboard, this does the job, and the laptop closes no prob, this doesnt get in the way at all.Now, I've heard that the fans are under the keyboard, so I take it off once in a while. (I also downloaded smc fan for my mac)It sometimes leaves its ""mark"" on my screen, which can just be wiped away."
1,Like Buying a $10 Plastic Bag,This product looked good when it was in its package. But then when i took it out and put it on my keyboard it soon became evident why this only cost $7 while competing brands sell this for over $20. The finishing of this product is horrible. Edges look like they were handcut with sizzors by a 10 year old as they are not even. Also this doesnt stick to the keyboard well. I would recommend spending a little more and getting somehting which will last longer.
3,Memo to Ramon Fonseca...,"I suggest that the Viet Minh soldier, not the German, was the best light infantyman in the20th century. This coming from someone that was with U.S. Marine infantry in VN in'68. Me."
5,Great book,Bought this book to replace one I had a while ago. I have read it quite a few times now and I still enjoy reading a no frills book about a messy conflict.
5,A new look at the SS,"This book provides a realistic view of the SS from their perspective. The noble SS viewed the concentration camp guards and Jew Hunters as swine. This book details how the true SS were the communist's worst nightmare and how they, in Indochina, were actually a friend of freedom. The SS division of the French Foreign Legion in Indochina really knew what it meant to fight a war with the goal of winning; they fought without the shackles of Political Correctness or absurd rules of engagement."
1,Poor quality re-print,"I last read this book about 35 years ago and really regretted losing my original copy. This particular re-print is extremely poor quality, almost like a bootleg, I was very disappointed."
5,Devil's Guard,"I loved this book. I don't believe as a christian that this is necessarily the right approach to win a war, but it is indisputable that you can win a war using Hans Josef Wagenmuellers methods."
5,Tactical SOP,As a former Green Beret (5th SFG) and Ranger (3rd RGR BN) I read this book and was amazed. It should be required reading fact or fiction for every light infantry or special ops soldier.
5,Very good... even if it was a '70s book.,Brutal reality of guerrilla warfare. An amazing look into a piece of history that may have indeed have happened. Thumbs up.
5,truely awesome,i agree totally with the first review.this book is simply the best of its kind. Once you start you will not put it down. They were hard men used to killing and the vietcong found out to their cost.i cannot stress enough the brilliance of this book.
2,Repetitive Romp,"I am intrigued that so many believe this to be nonfiction. It is incredibly campy and does not stand up to any real historical scrutiny. I concede that veterans of World War Two would have found themselves in the French Foreign Legion and I am confident that a few were from the Axis powers. And, yes, I believe there would be Waffen SS amongst them. But I have never heard of a full battalion raised for the fight in Indo China (Vietnam). The best part of this book were the first few chapters that dealt with the very last days of the WW2. The collapse of Nazi Germany continues to fascinate. When the action moves to Asia, it becomes repetitive and the author loses an opportunity to develop the characters. Instead it functions as an introductory primer to asymmetrical warfare (and a very brutal version of it). It reminded me of those Sven Hassel novels I read in the late 70's (with SS in the last name called out on the sensational covers).Interesting but strange overall."
3,unbelievable,fun to read book of Nazi's in Indochina after WWII. Is supposed to be a true story but does not come off as historical at all. Reads like fiction.
4,PECK IN AN ATYPICAL ROLE,"One of the earlier cynical Westerns that would go on to influence later films some say. Gregory Peck claimed the film was an attack on McCarthyism. Somewhat interesting camera angles as the director got his working start in Silent Films. Tale focuses on a man who is out to avenge the wrongs done to his wife by four men. Interesting enough twist at the end though not fully milked to its potential. Peck plays a more brutal, heroic role than usual. Based on a novel by Frank O'Rourke. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B; REVENGE FOCUSES: B minus to B; OVERALL GRADE: B; WHEN WATCHED: end of October (streamed)."
5,Great Western,This movie has so many great points and excellent moments it's hard to categorize them. The drama unfolds with great intensity and Gregory Peck holds the screen as you would expect.
4,One of the best Westerns in the old style,"Although production values have definitely gotten better, this 1958 western revenge story is still very tightly directed by any standards. I think it is one of Gregory Peck's best roles. It casts (a new) Lee Van Cleef and Stephen Boyd as villains; Boyd is chillingly psychopathic. Albert Salmi and Henry Silva (I remember him best as the dope fiend in Sharky's Machine) are ""good"" bad guys as well. The ending is terrific and packs as much of a whallop as I remembered."
1,interoperability,"Hmm, even one star does not do justice to this book. The first couple of chapters deal with .net and the other chapters deal with the fundamentals of j2ee. The coverage of each seems to be ok, but not to an extend that you can actually learn something from it. Just what i am saying, it is coverage for 2 times 6 or 7 chapters. E.g. the cover of the book mentions XML, in my opinion an integral part of j2ee. But hey, it is not mentioned in the J2EE section.Then finally this book seems to discuss interoperability, and guess what, it does not. The last chapter discusses a commercial tool (who ownes the shares?) which should help you out. But is that the only way, or only solution for interoperability ?In my case there is just nothing in the book that could help me out, so i gave it a one star"
1,The adjustment fastners are made of cheap delicate plastic,"As soon as I received the product I tried adjusting to fit my size. When adjusting the strap,the plastic fastener immediately broke. The products is not dependable for daily use. The basic construction of the product is just flimsy and poorly made and would probably have to be replaced within a short time of use. I would not recommend this product."
2,Bad choice,"Instructions unclear and once figured out, gun does NOT sta in holster without being snapped shut making it slow to withdraw.VERY bad choice on my part and did not live up to the mfg's discription."
2,String was not specified length,"I ordered the 56 inch string, but the one that came was only around 46 inches, luckily I was making a pvc bow so I cut off a few inches to make it fit"
1,not sized right,"i ordered a 50'' bow string from bear thru amazon 4 different times and got a 37''string each time don't thier employees read the forms,amazon tried to fix it and i got another 37'' bow stringi have never had a problem with amazon,in 10yrs til nowi am a prime member and shipping is free,but to get what i want for a $7.95 item i have to pay $6.95 for shipping some thing that fits in a reg. envelope.....something is wrong!!!"
1,Poor Review,High Energy Suet -Case of 12- High Energy Suet was damaged & competely melted when received.
5,BUY THIS ALBUM!!!,"I heard this album from a friend of mine named Slim Pick. I never heard of this rapper, but I gotta say that every single track is fire! This album is by far reaching the top of my list. I wish others out there knew of him and would give him a shot. Precise explodes w/ phat lyrics that will pierce your heart.I'm not sure what those other reviewsist are sayin about the 2 stars? Get Real - I've heard a lot of other albums that deserve 2 stars, THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM.IF YOUR STILL READING THIS - PLEASE, NO LIE, BUY THIS ALBUM!!!"
1,Very disappointed!,A hodge podge of cards - after the good ones were taken out - misleading that not current year. Waste of money.
5,Good movie!,"I haven't watched it yet, but I am sure it is great. I will forever miss seeing Bernie Mac living, but I will always get his movies and standup acts! RIP Mr. Mac! June."
5,A Very Nice Tribute,This is a nice tribute to a great comedic mind. It praises him as a comedian and devoted family man.
5,The best Christmas gift ever!!!,I bought this DVD for my husband and he loves it. Bernie Mac is one of his favorites. Great DVD.
2,comedy,"Too much vulgarity!! Was not as comical as I thought it would be, however I would have enjoyed it if it weren't for every other word ----."
3,Excellent Davis but nothing package,"It is surprising that this famous film, one of the best in the legacy of the great Bette Davis, has been issued on DVD in such a basic package. All the superlatives apply to Davis as the repressed Boston spinster, Paul Henried as her lover, Gladys Cooper as her autocratic mother and Claude Rains as her psychiatrist. The film is a superb Warner's production. Davis was vigilant on the set, directing the traffic with director Irving Rapper and ensuring that it was quality all the way. A minor criticism is that the transitions are often clumsy and sudden, causing a jarring shift in moods.While the print of the film presented here is perfect, it is disappointing that the only extra is the original trailer. Surely an expert commentary was warranted, particularly when they were made available on many lesser Davis vehicles. At least the DVD can be purchased sometimes at a bargain price."
5,Shopping Can Really Cheer A Girl Up,"The joys of retail therapy are taken to exhilarating heights in this beautifully crafted melodrama. This is such tremendous trash! It has it all: secret lovers that can never consummate their desire, freudian mother-blaming psychoanalysis, and a woman who has had the make-over of a life-time (those eyebrows really needed work!). From a sad spinster to a heroic heiress, Bette Davis is at her teary-eyed best. This absolutely stunning weepie proves that blowing smoking in someone's face can mean so much more that ""f*** off""."
4,NOW a Davis Fan,"I was never a Bette Davis fan. Seemed that any of her movies I tended catch on TV, or would see clips from in various biographical presentations, highlighted her many less-than-pleasant characters.Finally made myself watch Now, Voyager and enjoyed it tremendously.The story seemed to be a little muddled in parts - perhaps suffering from the book to film transition, but not distracting enough to make much difference.If you've left Bette alone because of her, ""edgier"" roles (to put it politely), don't be afraid of this movie. You won't be disappointed."
4,The moon and the stars all in one!,"""Now Voyager"" is the archetypal classic romance and women's picture - good soap opera raised to the power of ten - with its themes of emotional repression, doomed romance, the power of psychoanalysis and surrogacy. Davis and Henreid are perfect as Charlotte and Jerry who transform each others lives. Although very serious, film benefits from is humorous touches. For example, when Charlotte wants her identity to remain a secret, Jerry introduces her as Camille. 'Why?' asks Charlotte. 'Its the only French name I know besides Fifi' Henreid replies. The film is pure escapism so don't analyze its authenticity too closely. Just sit back and enjoy the wonderfully romantic music and performances by the stars who were at their peak."
5,Wonderful old movie,"This was a wonderful, elegant, old movie that I had not seen before. The perfect movie for a Saturday afternoon."
5,Atmospheric Soapy-Suds!,"Solid-gold Bette! One of my favorite movies. Davis and Henreid make the perfect 40s couple; his lighting of two cigarettes and handing one to her was shocking for the time and still erotic today. Claude Rains as the understanding therapist makes the perfect accompaniment to their romance.Movies like this just aren't made anymore. Today this would star Julia Roberts and Kevin Costner and end in a happy mush. A true woman like Bette Davis knows what it's like to love and sacrifice. A fitting summming up of this cinema classic is Davis' final line, ""Oh, Jerry. Don't let's ask for the moon. We have the stars!"""
5,Now Voyager - Bette at Her Best,"Bette made some terrific films.... this is my personal favorite along with ""Mr. Skeffington""... the ONLY criticism is the biographies of the cast ONLY work with Ms. Davis.. the others on the menu do not function.... still.. the plus side is the stunning transfer of the film to DVD. It is fresh and few flaws are visible on this version. I saw the new version of ""Sunset Blvd."" just after seeing this film, and though ""Voyager"" is 8 years older, it looks far cleaner and crisper than ""Sunset"" does. Bravo to the restoration crew here! The film itself, is of course, a masterpiece and well worth the purchase price. A true gem!"
5,"""Classic Bette""","""Now, Voyager"", released in 1942, may very well be one of the best films Bette Davis ever starred in. Critically and commercially successful, ""Now, Voyager"" garnered Davis with her sixth Oscar nomination as Best Actress playing Charlotte, a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown beacuse of her domineering old mother. Deciding to take a cruise on the advice of her doctor she finds love in the arms of a man who has his hands full coping with a rebellious daughter whom Charlotte is determined to help.Many have panned the film as being too campy, but the movie is well-written with beautiful cinematography and a music score all will remember.Films like these are not made any more!"
5,"Wonderful movie, but...","Wonderful movie, but didn't anyone want to strangle ""little Tina?"" I know child performances from that era date a bit, but she was just awful. Paul should have put her up for adoption and sailed away with Bette. Otherwise, one of the best."
5,"Attractive, Excellent","The pen writes with an even smoothness far better than I've come to expect from fountain pens at the higher end, where less attention is paid to writing with them than to making them beautiful. This is a very fine writing instrument as well as attractive to the eye. It is very slim which may not be to everyone's taste as it is to mine."
5,Great Backpacking Tent!,"I just took this tent on a three day backpack trip to above 12,000 ft. It was the perfect weight. It fit two people and two mid-sized dogs in it just fine. Nice and cozy! It faired very well against constant wind and rain. Bone dry inside! I would definately recommend this tent!"
5,small and funny,"I like to travel lite, this tend is perfect for that, you should be carefull with the instructions about the corners or you will get flooded, I love the exclamation symbol in the side of the tent."
4,Possibly the best tent for the money.,"I purchased this tent for the 2010 MS-150. It was a good thing I did. We had rain overnight and cold temps in the morning. Set up is easy with just two poles. There are short sleeves for the poles on one end and clips from the top to the other end. Super fast and easy to set up and tear down. The rain fly provided excellent coverage. That and the little vent on the end opposite the screen meant that I woke up Sunday morning dry as a bone. No rain, no condensation. Pay attention to the weather so you can set up and stake out the tent facing the right way. Do that, and you'll have no problems.My only complaint isn't about the tent by my local Eureka dealers. None of them carry any accessories - footprint, gear loft. So I had to use online retailers."
4,handy dandy,"Super easy to set up, even on your lonesome. Really appreciate the bathtub bottom. Stakes are worthless, but just grab some decent ones from any camping supply store. Great value, has served me well."
1,Horrible little tent,"I spent one of the most miserable nights of my life in this tent. My daughter and I were camping on Current River and got caught in a strong rainstorm. The pitiful little excuse for a rainfly that this tent comes with is almost criminally negligent on Eureka's part. Any tent that doesn't offer a full-coverage rainfly is begging to leak.Woke up with darn near an inch of water in the tent with us. Wet bags, wet clothes, wet us.I hope to never have the misfortune of spending another night in a Eureka tent. At least not this one.I got home and ordered a Columbia Hawk Ridge tent instead. It's made all the difference. Much superior in every single way.I can't recommend this tent, unless you're planning on camping indoors."
1,"I love tents,,but,","I love tents , but this is cheap and poorly made. Maybe for someone used to less quality and features."
4,"Not Mae's best script, but her best score","Like her nearest competitors the Marx brothers and W.C. Fields, Mae West worked best in films where the logic of the plot made the least sense (as in I'M NO ANGEL where she's a lion tamer who conquers New York's society lions). In this film version of one of her stage plays, the plot is pretty sensible, which acts to its detriment. Mae doesn't get nearly as great lines as she usually does, and there's all this creaking plot machinery to establish her moral position and that of her no-good boyfriends. Still, it has great sets and costumes, and you get to hear her really cut loose with some of the best honky-tonk songs she ever got to sing in her wonderful adenoidal way, including ""My Old Flame"" and ""Memphis Blues."" Her accompaniment is by Duke Ellington and his orchestra (you even get to see them with her in one scene), which should let you know how special this score is. And Mae is, of course, always Mae."
3,Working - Maybe,"More than the wrap, I like what the solution has done for my skin. I've been eating healthy and drinking plenty of water and I'm not sure if the slight results I'm seeing are from this or my diet. But, the cream has improved the texture of my skin - so even if the wrap isn't working, that's a benefit."
2,Seemed like a good idea,I have not noticed a difference and feel like I threw away money to wear an uncomfortable. I think I just need to go to the gym. (Look at fitness enthusiast who are well into their 40s; droopy chin?...nope...)
3,Lint and Pet Hair,"This mouse pad serves my basic needs, but it is very quickly collecting a lot of dirt, lint, and pet hair, which is difficult to remove. I am having trouble getting a compact mouse pad that doesn't have some basic flaw.The pad is nice and flat, and does not emit any odors, and it adheres wonderfully to my desk without actually gluing itself down. The surface is a padded black fabric, which drags on the mouse a little, and leads to the above mentioned problem."
4,Tracklist,"I like Keith Martin a lot. It's too bad his albums are usually so obscure and hard to find.Tracklist:1. Because Of You (Acoustic Version)2. Coming Home3. Whateva' You Need4. Love Of My Life5. Love Doesn't Care6. Silly Heart7. I'm Sorry8. Can We Go Back9. The Only One10. Can't Get Over You11. To You, Oh Lord12. I Can't Bear13. Because Of You (Original Version)14. The Closer I Get To You (ft Noah)15. Boyz II Men Medley (ft Jay R, Mark Laygo & Christian Puerto)Peace,D"
1,A bad idea,"We received this as a gift and it's just not a good product. The suggested age is 3-6 years and it's clearly not appropriate for this age group. The paint included is permanent (non-washable). The suggested crafts were extremely difficult or downright impossible for children. We are a family that welcomes messy and creative activities, but this was just horrible."
3,Problems with this book,"Mr. Shachtman has written an interesting book that explores a less well know part of the history of World War II, but I have a serious problem with the book. I don't know why, but the book has an unusually high number of factual errors. Two example: Antwerp is referred to as a Dutch port. (Page 292). In several places the author refers to the bandwidth of radars, but the context suggests that he means wavelength, something completely different.My problem is this: how much of the parts that I don't know about should I believe? It is regretable that Mr. Shachtman did not have proper prepublication editorial support. Without the doubts raised by the numerous error, I would give this book five stars."
1,Quit on the 3rd page,"I had purchased this book many years ago, but found time to open it just today. It stars with German V-weapons. I read on the 3rd page that the shells of the V-3 (Hochdruckpumpe) weighed 300 pounds. The figure seemed incorrect to me, because I knew of conventional naval gun shells which weighed more than ten times as much. (BL 18 inch Mk I naval gun). This gave me an urge to research about the book. So I checked the reviews here, and learned that errors are rampant in this book. I also searched the net and found that the author is not really an expert.So now the book is in my trashcan. It had been a waste of money, I didn't want it to be a waste of time as well."
3,Doesn't always work as intended,"We got this for Christmas. It doesn't work that well with larger feet. My child can answer the questions, but in trying to reach the correct picture inadvertantly steps on a space set for another picture. She doesn't actually step on the wrong picture itself. It is frustrating to be told you are wrong when you never answered the question. My child was so excited for this toy, but it has fallen by the wayside because of this problem. It would have been a better toy if it had more ""dead"" space between the pictures."
5,Kind of a space age look,The case has a space age look to it. But the bonus of a Rapid Car Charger and a Travel Charger is Fantastic. I have not used the travel charger yet but the car charger is great!!!! I can listen while it stays charged and then when I get where I'm going it is still fully charged!
1,The time of our lives,I love Il Divo but very disappointed with this CD. It's very short and a repeat of songs in previous releases.
1,When will they arrive?,I will be happy to review any of the three CDs that I ordered when and if I receive them! Robert E Yost
3,Disappointment,"Only four songs, which were okay, not worth the price of the album. I wish that online retailers or those who sell cd's online would list the songs on the albums. This is a bad rip off."
5,This Book is as big as Godzilla!,This book rocks and so does the game but I sure wish Space Godzilla and Biolantte were in the game but It does'nt matter!
5,Great indoor/outdoor thermometer!,Loved this indoor/outdoor thermometer. It works very well! And it's attractive. And it was a great price too!
1,lame lame lame,this will not play. what is wrong with it??is it my kindle or is it the show??paid $2 & we don't even get to watch this trash!!someone let me know if u have the same problem ....wanted to give it no stars..what's. the deal with that? ??
3,poor directions,"The fence instructions stated that the holes in the table needed to be drilled 15 1/4"" o.c. which indeed the table was pre drilled exactly this dimension. Problem was the slots in the fence were 15 1/16"" o.c. making it impossible to use without redrilling. the little plastic levelers for the router plate drove me nuts before I figured out how they could work, the instructions certainly did not give a clue to these or other parts, which I eventually figured out on my own. This aside, this table looks like it will give many years of excellent service."
3,good but not great,"I just bought this and I can alreay see the downsides of this table. It has an mdf table and it weighs as much as a twin barrel hitachi compressor. The legs take a little getting used to, to work with. I was trying to laminate a router table I was trying to build, and contact cement proved to be just a little to messy for me. So, I bought this. Save time and money. Just buy a router table, with legs. The fence on this looks okay. the good thing is that it is made of aluminium, the bad thing is that it is small, and I don't know if it could be customizable to a larger fence. But dont get me wrong, it is still decent and easy to work with."
4,Frustrating instructions,"Like the reviewer before, I found the instructions frustrating. The parts provided are different than the descriptions and illustration and I have four plastic spacers that are a total mystery. There are three separate documents - you need to digest them all to figure out how to assemble the table.The table itself looks good and should work well for my needs (assuming those mysterious uninstalled plastic spacers don't cause some kind of problem while I'm using it)."
5,Well finally Barry has back up,"I first came across Barry Fells books nealry ten years ago and always felt that he got a bad rap and his evidence was beyond doubt , its only PC thugs who bash him because no one wants to give any more light to white culture and want them to stay as Demons and monsters , all of this hatred stems from 15th century colonialism , but in light of the recent ties of Solutrean artifacts in Iberia and the Solotrean artifacts in North america , it is clearly evident Barry Fell was right all along , even when we find White Skeletal remains in north america thousands of years old we still have to be PC about it, Im so sick of that, evidence is evidence Fact is fact ,"
1,Whacky,"Fall for this stuff and I have a bridge I'd like to sell you. Fell is one of those strange archeologists who believes ancient civilizations came to America long before Columbus. He sees Druids in New England, Libyans in Arizona, and Celts everywhere. The evidence is very skimpy and Fell stretches it to what HE wants to believe. His style and approach to his subject are very academic--but only the better to fool ya. Just about everything Fell proposes has been disproved by reputable archeologists, but I guess, like P.T. Barnum, he believes there's a sucker born every minute. Don't fall for it."
4,Ancient Mysteries,"I first read Barry Fell's America B.C. many years ago as a teenager, and being lucky enough to live in Vermont, have visited various ancient sites here and in New Hampshire. Even if you are skeptical after reading this book, at least let it be a jumping off point to read and discover more about this intriguing subject. Another short, but wonderful book is ""New England's Ancient Mysteries"" by Robert Ellis Cahill. I picked this up at America's Stonehenge in Salem, NH and am anxious to visit some of the other sites outlined in this book. Also visit www.neara.org for more information on New England Antiquities. It truly is in your own backyard!!"
4,Very good on most points.,"Much of ttthe evidence is very believable, however Fell does go too far on some points. It would be nice if more research were put into this subject. While I feel that Fell goes a little too far on some points and seems to extreme in his acceptance of almost any claim to Old World visitation of America, I think it is wrong to deny the possiblity of any pre-columbian contact. His work on celtic colonization of New England seem partualarly convincing. The only glaring hole I can find is that if contact was as wide spread as he claims, why did the visitors and colonists bring no Old World crops or domestic animals to the Americas?"
2,Good basic idea carried too far.,"Fell starts out with a series of good ideas, but carries them to the region of absurdity rather quickly. Celts in New Hampshire - possibly. Phonicians in Iowa and Egyptians in Oklahoma - I don't think so. I read the book years ago and have looked into it recently. Fell's scholarship is typical of the type to avoid - looks good going in and then departs from sound methodology and critical analysis and jumps into the world of fantasy history so beloved by the marginally eduacated. Sorry"
4,As much if not more about west African religious practices as secret societies,"Written and researched in the 1920's this book is as much or more about the Pagan religions and folk customs of various west African tribes as it is about any secret societies that exist in those cultures. I always have to laugh when I read these books about ""secret"" societies whether it be about Freemasons or some tribal group in west Africa because just how secret are they if for one you even know that they exist, but for another most of the time all you have to do is dig up the right books and you can learn most of their so called ""secrets"" and this book has plenty of that although most of it is an overlap to the African Pagan religions and their rituals/beliefs. I would highly recomend this to the person researching African religion, not so much to the conspiracy researcher who might be drawn in by the title of the book."
2,copco cup,Cup is not very good. It seems to leak and drips when drinking. Very hard to use in the car while driving.
4,Great knee pads!,These knee pads work great. They fit very well and are actually comfortable. The hard plastic shell on the face looks like it will last a long time as well. I think its a real good buy.
1,Bait and Switch!!!!,"The picture they have with the listing is of a completly different pair of knee pads....I saw the picture and really wanted that set because I had a set of them and wore them out, they were the most comfortable I've ever had...SHAME ON YOU AMAZON, BAIT AND SWITCH....Oh yea i hate the set the sent,"
4,Good Book with Real-Life Samples of Successful Book Proposals,"Written by a respected literary agent and a published author, Bulletproof Book Proposals provides succinct, clear, to-the-point instructions for crafting a winning book proposal. Authors Brodowsky and Neuhaus break the process into 10 simple steps with exercises to help you accomplish each step effectively:* Defining your idea* Choosing a title* Crafting the opener* Defining your market* Analyzing the competition* Developing a platform* Selling yourself* Creating chapter outlines* Writing sample chapters* Packaging your proposalWhile there are numerous resources available that teach writers how to develop a compelling book proposal, what sets this book apart from the rest is the inclusion of 12 real-life book proposals that successfully landed book deals. Each proposal includes commentary from the author, editor, and agent on why the proposal sold - making Bulletproof Book Proposals an invaluable resource."
2,1970's jumble style movies,I love horror films and even bad ones.But these are hard movies to love. I can forgive most cheap horror moviesmade in europe from the 1970's for most of their failings. but these are part of the throw everything at you and it doesn't need to make sense at the end type of movie. This was related to the drug culture of the time which was into burning their brains with acid and thinking that they learned anything other than learning what a schizophrenic see's and thinks like! Both movies are low budget affairs and even the excellent actor richard conte can't save 'evil eye' from being a jumble of confusion. The other one is similiar too but it has some disturbing scenes of it's own. Still if you love bad horror then you may want these around; you won't enjoy them as much as many other bad horror films from that decade but at least you get two horror movies here.
3,An honest assesment of Milwaukee,This book is very academic and very Milwaukee-centric. If that's what you're looking for then it is great.
2,Not very helpful,"This book was a big disappointment. I was hoping for detailed instructions for the construction of a studio, and what I got was a refresher course in Acoustics 101. The book has a lot of theory which could be helpful to someone that doesn't already know about diffusion, absorbtion and reflection of sound waves. What it doesn't have is room dimensions, angles of walls, or decent illustrations. The illustration for a garage multi-track studio was literally a line drawing of a square with a bisecting line across the corner signifying what would be a disfunctional control room. If you're not ready to build a studio and want some good information on room modes and acoustics, this is a good enough book. If you want to apply these principles and actually build a studio, there are better instructions on several free websites."
3,"New edition, good!","I own a previous edition. I read it very carefully. The book is very useful, if we understand the word. I mean that if you want to build a Recording Studio, fast cheap and easy, read this book. There were serious incongruences in the previous edition I hope to find renewed in this one. For example, the cutoff frequency value, which in the Master Handbook of Acoustics is set to a certain value, in this book has another value! both books have been authored by Mr. Everest. I will try this new edition and more comments will come up. Anyway, buy the book. If you use the recommendations given by Mr. Everest, you will earn money."
2,Should be for construction engineer,"I thought it was going to cover the entire aspects of the recording studio including the suitable equipments, unfortunately it was just directed toward the construction. I'm not the construction engineer so why would I care too much on the details. I think basic theory on the construction is enough and more elaboration is needed for the furniture and equipment selection."
2,Half interesting...,"I thought the portions of the book dealing with makeup to be the most interesting. What some women put themselves through! I definitely saw some parallels to our society today. Yet when it came to the chapters about hair removal and clothing, I was bored senseless. Is it, however, fascinating to see how our definition of ""beauty"" has changed over the years. I especially like the old advertisements and pictures the author included. Not bad, but those not specifically interested in women's clothing styles of years past may be a bit bored in some sections."
1,Disappointed,"I read the whole book and I watched the movie with Rutger Hauer who is a very good actor, but both was not very satisfying.There is a much more compelling and unpredictable novel on the same topic by Irving Wallace, ""The 7th Secret"".Since it has been published in 1986, I was always wondering why it never has been filmed.I really can recommend reading ""The 7th Secret"". That's a fascinating story and it keeps you on the edge of your seat!"
4,Uber Fantastic,Great book. Imagine a film noir murder-mystery meets a crazy alt-world WWII period piece and you have FATHERLAND. Not groundbreaking and the ending wasn't as good as the beginning but solid read start to finish and definitely one of the best in this genre. Author did a great job of pulling back the layers of the onion of Nazi Germany and showing it as the huge bureaucratic beast that committed atrocities and not simply one-dimensional evil Hitler henchmen as it's often portrayed.
3,See above.,The Publisher's Weekly review pretty much nails it. I enjoyed reading it but was ultimately happy it was such a fast read.
5,"A great, quick read","Not much to add, except that I found the book haunting and engaging. Clearly a classic among alternate history novels."
4,Fatherland,"Fatherland puts the ""what if"" equation into reality, as did George Orwell's 1984. This book clearly makes the reader respect what we, as a socity, should learn what history is all about. Think God, this is only a novel. And, a very good one."
3,"hard to get started reading because of the words, but good",Book concept is good - had to read 25% before I really liked - would not have finished if not recommended by friend
3,Compelling narrative,"A compelling thriller, said amid the ""alternative history"" of a Hitler victory in World War II. Quite fascinating. My only disappointment is that the other did not fully develop the historical aspects, which might have been quite interesting."
3,"Well written, good read, thought provoking.",Evil wins if the sacrifice was for nothing. We should know
2,"An opportunity for an amazing book, lost","This book, presenting a detective story in a ""what if"" world had the potential to be one of the greatest books of the decade, in a terrifying world where Germany had won WWII. However, Harris' writing is not compelling and it is difficult to be drawn into the book. The plot itself is not that interesting and surprising. All in all, an opportunity for a great book, lost."
2,Disappointing.,Maybe I had high expectations with this book but this is just one more book.Boring and disappointing therefore I don`t recommend it.
4,"Good book, but not mind-blowing","Fatherland makes for a solid read, engaging from beginning to end, but it could have done so much more. I initially purchased this book more for the purposes of exploring alternative history than for the main plot. The plot turned out to be worthwhile, but I was disappointed by a lack of exploration of this society. I was especially curious about Kennedy's meeting; the book did not elaborate on that as much as I would have liked.The main plot is engaging, albeit somewhat cliched. A foreign journalist joins the protagonist? I've read that many times before. It's mostly the twists and turns that make this worthwhile. The end shocked me, although in hindsight I should have seen that coming. But I won't ruin it for those who haven't read the book."
4,Pretty good book although the ending was a disappointment,"For the most part, this book was excellent. The descriptions left me with an eerie image of what the world could have been like had Hitler won the war. Harris presents a great ""what if"" story that I had trouble putting down. I was very disappointed with the ending. Obviously, I won't go into too much depth about my reasons for this, because I don't want to ruin it for others. Still, I liked the book. Read it; maybe you'll like the ending more than I did."
5,Listened to cassette----most impressed.,"A great job done by WERNER KLEMPERER in his narration. Although fiction, author's description of Nazi deathcamps most descriptive. Book should be required reading in all schools."
3,good idea.....,Though makes you think what if....Harris is not as detailed oriented as Forsyth is..Would like to see how Forsyth would've written this...
3,"This is no ""what if Spiderman joined the Fantastic Four""","Fatherland was a good book, but it was not what I would classify an alternative history. It was basically a rewriting of Orwell's 1984 in an imaginary world that might have been. There were facinating nuggets of ""what-ifs"" peppered throughout the book, but that is not the focus. The focus is on the March, Charlie, and the mystery that they are trying to unravel."
2,Lacking in imagination,"The major disappointment with this book seems to be the failure of ""holocaust-denial"". It would have been much more interesting if the Holocaust hadn't developed & Hitler's war against Usury had been allowed proceeded as he intended; then the book could have explored what a world without Usury would be like. Would we have developed an atom-bomb all? (I think Hitler had rejected the idea as too barbaric.)"
3,honestly I didn't think too highly of it,"First of all I want you to know that this book is not that good of a book. It is more of a Hardy Boys Novel set in the land of where the ______ _______ ________.but other than that the book wasn't too good. You might as well just think of what would happen if the ____ ______ ______ and put in your own Law and Order commentary for the same book.well not bad for an attempt to see an alternate reality.Plus the book was really dark, depressing, and boring.But then Again I am born in america, I expect sex, gore, and violence 24/7."
1,Predictable,"I'd read a review of this book, and while the premise was interesting, it was predictible and boring. Just an updated remake of ""If the South Won The War."" only focussing on the Third Reich. Iasn't able to give it less than one star. One star is too much."
3,Overpraised,"Fatherland is overpraised as a work of alternate history, but is still a good yarn. I was disappointed largely because Harris seems less interested in his setting -- Berlin in 1964, under a 75-year-old Hitler and anticipating a visit by President Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. -- than in telling a detective story. If you like that sort of thing, you might enjoy this book but would be bored by what alternate history there is. If you're an alternate history fan, you'll be bored by the sleuthing. Harris does offer some entertaining visual descriptions of alternate Berlin, where Albert Speer's mammoth monuments and buildings have been constructed, but because of Harris's ambivalence about what kind of book this is, the result is the perfect novel for no one."
2,Disappointing audiocassette,"It almost doesn't seem fair to rate this audiocassette in the same pool with the book. I'm sure, after reading a sampling of the reviews, that the book is MUCH better. Something is lost in the translation and abridgement for audiocassette. Sure, the interesting premise is still there as is the big secret. But the page turning suspense is lost in the process. That's what I get for being cheap and checking it out of the library - right?"
5,Unveiling and fascinating,"Many compare ""Fatherland"" to 1984. This Comparaison is right and wrong. Right, because it's a novel of a depressing system in that you have to watch your words and deeds. And wrong- because it's so real. It's not only an utopia Harris describes. It's an option. It COULD have been like that. The book uncovers the German soul witohut hurting it. The Germans in the book are human beings- no nazi killer machines. There are evil characters and good ones. But above all there's the system that won the war it should have lost. I recommend this book to all Germans who say: ""I wouldn't have been a nazi"". I would have been one. That's what I know after reading ""Fatherland""."
5,Critical success and Popular,"I was unimpressed with the film, but one of life's rules is that the book is almost always better than the film. This book was dignified, fascinatingly horrible yet humane.The image of the Great Hall in Berlin is still burned into my brain and after reading a biography of Albert Speer was disturbed to find that the Hall and the Arch of victory would have been built had Hitler won.The murder mystery plot is occaisonally impenetrable but the details of Hitler's new society are always in the background, emerging in the narrative like some dread spectre.The ending was particularly brave. This book centred around one man's dignified struggle to find decency in a society with none.This book left me as cold as 1984. As Orwell said, it must never be allowed to happen."
5,Orwell meets Deighton,"Robert Harris has done something that I've been waiting to see for years: turn out a WWII political thriller that is as good as something that Frederick Forsyth or Tom Clancy could write. In the lines of Jack Higgins' ""The Eagle Has Landed"" and Len Deighton's infinitely better ""SS-GB"", Harris has surpassed both of them by throwing us into the nightmare world of a Nazi-dominated Europe. Even though it's probably more far-fetched than both ""Eagle"" and ""SS-GB"", Harris makes his atmosphere utterly believable and totally scary. This is something that Jack Higgins could never do, and Deighton has done only to a certain degree. This is a book you'll want to read over and over again."
5,A great novel,This is a great novel it is very well written by Robert Harris it is very scary and dark novel about how the world would be if Hitler and nazy Germany had won the war. I don't think that most of the things he wrote were really accurate but it was really exciting and after all this is a fiction novel is supposed to be made up. Harris should write more often he is a very talented writer from what I can see in this novel. This book was a page turner from end to finish.
2,Great Scenario-Author does nothing with it.,"The whole basis for this novel, that the Nazi's won the war and Hitler's 75th birthday celebration is coming combined with a detective story is a ""what if"" readers dream but the author sets up a great premise and does absolutely nothing with it. Oh, there's a murder, and there's a secret behind the murder, but I can't believe all the other reviewers of this novel were even a bit surprised by the ""secret"" revealed. The only reason that even a moron couldn't guess what the ""secret"" is would be that there would have to be something else in a book this hyped, wouldn't there? Sadly there isn't. Also, the author pretty much stole the idea from Len Deighton's absolutely superb novel SS-GB which he could be forgiven if it was any good. SS-GB is the real thing and has an actual ending to go with the premise. Fatherland is a very poor imitation."
5,Good things can come in 400 pg packages,"This book was amazing. I have never read such an interesting novel with the exact play on words that Dumas entertained me with. Although the novel was extremely long, half French and half Shakespere, I was still caught up in the energetic plot following D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos and Aramis! In the beginning of the novel, all D'Artagnan wants is to become a Musketeer. He proves himself worthy of being one of the king's guards (later a Musketeer) and becomes friends with the Musketeers and enemies with the Cardinal's guards. D'Artagnan gets into tons of trouble throughout the novel, and somehow manages to defeat all the evil surrounding him with his amazing intelligence and the help of friends!"
3,"Good plot, but can be long and confusing","d'Artagnan comes to new town and meets three new friends and a woman that he falls in love with. He is here to become a musketeer and defend the king.His new friends are Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, and the woman he loves is Constance Bonacieux. Constance is captured and he and his friends embark on a mission to save her and the king of France, who is about to be overthrown by the cardinal.Along the way, they meet many enemies, including Lady de Winter, who is a spy for the cardinal that is trying to assassinate the Duke of Buckingham. She is also out to kill d'Artagnan. To find out the exciting conclusion your going to have to read the book, because if I told you, you wouldn't want to buy it. I thought this plot, but it was very long, and sometimes very hard to understand."
2,lizzie berster,"This book is about the great adventures of three of the King's musketeers named Porthos, Athos,and Aramis, and their new found friend and a man trying to become a musketeer named d'Artagan. When d'Artagan arrives in France he is challanged to a duel against the other orignal musketeers. They decide not to duel but instead they fight against the cardinal's guards. After that they become the best of friends, and stick together through everything good and bad. I really didn't enjoy this book but I give it 2 stars because it had some good parts. There were some really boring parts that were bad. It was difficult to understand."
3,an okay book but don't go out of your way to read it,"I had to read this book for my English class this year and I really didn't care. The story is about a French man named D'Artagnan. D'Artagnan is the central character of the novel. He is young, brave, and ambitious. With his father's advice he goes to Paris to seek his fortune. While there in France he meets three other musketeers named Athos, Aramis and Porthos. Athos is the leader of the three. Aramis is also young and talks about leaving the musketeers to join the church. Porthos is loud and self-centered. This book is about their adventures in France and them trying to stop the Cardinal. This book was okay except for some of the word and it was also really long. The history of this book also didn't interest me that much. This book defiantly wasn't the greatest book I have ever read but it was okay. I recommend it if you have a lot of time on your hands or if you really love to read"
4,The three musketeers,"it's a very good book--an exciting classic, although on the purchase screen it says the reading level is for level 9-12. i am a high school student and find it a bit hard to understand myself, and certainly no one younger would be able to understand this book. anyway, it's great and i encourage people to read it. i was slightly disappointed to find out that some of the musketeers betray in various ways...ie. when d'artagnan has affairs strictly to get what he wants. that is my only complaint. otherwise it's good!"
3,The start of an epic adventure....,"For those trying to read The Musketeers Saga: I was thoroughly confused by the order of books. In the original French, there are only three (3) books - 1. The Three Musketeers 2. Twenty Years After and 3. Ten Years Later. That's it - no more. But when translated, most English editions split the behemoth Ten Years Later into a Trilogy (and some four - which make it all the more confusing!).So the reading list should be 1. The Three Musketeers 2. Twenty Years After and 3a. The Vicomte de Bragelonne 3b. Louise de la Valliere and 3c. The Man in the Iron Mask. Five books - that's the total series!I highly recommend the Oxford University Press': Oxford World's Classics editions - which has the complete unabridged and annotated versions of all of these books."
2,It's Abridged!,"Look, I love The Three Musketeers, absolutely love it. It's clever, adventurous, and laugh out loud hilarious. It is one of my all-time favorites, but this version is abridged. If you are going to go to all the trouble to read a book, why not read the whole thing? At the time I bought this book, I did not know it was abridged. When I began reading it, I realized little parts of the story were missing and I was not at all pleased. If you want Dumas, get unabridged. It may take a bit longer to finish, but it is very much worth it."
3,Note of Caution,"The Three Musketeers is one of the great adventure classics of all time. Be warned, however, that the Puffin Classics paperback is an abridged edition. You will get more wonderful detail in an unabridged edition."
3,Exciting But Repetitive,"This is an exciting book that unfortunately feels formulamatic at times. Maybe that is because it was produced as a serialized novel originally. It can have that ""find out what our heros are up to next issue"" feel.Overall it is fast paced, but long. I liked the action sequences and the author's creation of distinct personalities for his heros. While I had to read this over a long period of time, I found I enjoyed it most when I could put in a couple of hours at a time and fully submerge myself in the author's world. I would recommend picking this up for a vacation book or if you know you'll be able to keep at it night after night.The author uses a convincing historical and period backdrop for his tale. It feels real which aids the story. The romantic nature of his heros leads to a wonderful story of comradship and loyalty, good versus evil, etc. Many things to like, but I did not find it deserves quite as lofty a pedestal as most of these other reviewers do."
4,Great story line- a little too wordy,"I really liked this book. My favorite character was Milady, even though she was the vilaness. I thought she was very smart and a very good actress."
3,Expected more practical stuff from it,"I bought this book in hope to learn about the practical side of style management - how to calculate information coefficients and how to explain them, how to do single and multivariate regressions on the portfolio, etc. If that is what you want, get another book. Once you read it, come back and read this book, and it will give you a deeper understanding of the usage, history, theory behind it."
4,ANOTHER BLUES CLASSIC FROM MR. TAYLOR,"4 stars only because it isn't quite as good as RING THAT BELL. This is a bit more traditional ( as much as traditional is possible for MELVIN ) than RING THAT BELL, I therefore find it a bit less exciting. Where RING THAT BELL is an electric blues CD in the GARY MOORE mold, this is more lay back. It still reaches the same hights, just not as often. I don't think MELVIN TAYLOR could produce anything but outstanding CD's. He is bursting with so much talent as a vocalist and guitarist, that everyone of his CD's is a must have for BLUES fans. He sounds like a mix of the best of BUDDY GUY, a large dose of SRV and a pinch of GARY MOORE.I am just sad that I will never see him live."
2,"Informative, but...","As an avid reader about the problems, which have plagued the Balkans throughtout the 90s I found the book to be both informative from a personal narrative perspective, but tiresome from the repeated diatribes directed towards those who were not pro-Bosniac. While little argument can be made against the documented atrocities committed against the city of Sarajevo, no effort was made to look at the Bosnian-Muslim leadership and their role/complicity in the conflict. For anyone interested in the personal tragedies faced by those who lived in the city while under siege, it is a great story. Overall though, I thought the book was diminished by the often-repeated diatribes against just about anyone connected with the then-ongoing peace talks (Vance-Owen), or the UNPROFOR mission."
4,Realistic and objective portrayal of the Bosnian war,"I enjoyed reading ""The testimony of a Bosnian"" because it was not only a realistic portrayal of the Serb's aggression on Bosnia but was also very informative. I only did not agree on one statement, and that is the claim that, before the aggression, Bosnian Muslims, Catholics, and Orthodox citizens lived in tolerance and peace with each other. There have always been problems in this country and people have been treated unequally all the time because of their religious preference. Even now, after the war, there is hardly any improvement. Still, I would definitely recommend the book - great historic facts and easy to read and understand."
1,"Greatest Hits ""Album Versions"" - Kumbia Kings","I feel so ripped off. The CD contains CENSORED VERSIONS of songs. I don't want bleeps in the middle of a CD I purchased, as if I were listening to public radio. If I want that, I'll go to (bleeping) Walmart. Maybe, somewhere in the Amazon description, it was stated that that was the case, but I didn't see it. I will never buy another Kumbia Kings CD."
4,Does what it is supposed to do,I bought this album for my spouse to listen to while undergoing acupuncture and it puts her immediately into a deep meditative state. What more could you want?
2,Not as good as I'd hoped,"This book did not teach me nearly as much as I'd hoped. It gives a very superficial outline of a lot of topics, but somehow when I finished, I didn't feel like I'd learned anything."
2,Student,"While the book has a mildly intriguing plot, the writing is so bad that, even taking into account the brevity of the novel, it is difficult to sit through and read it. The characters are poorly developed and the writer rarely lets the reader think on their own. Everyting is distinctly pointed out. No style comes through in the author's words. It's almost as if you are reading a textbook. No matter your age, this book should be avoided. If you are a child look for any another WWII book and it will be a much more enjoyable and informative read, even if it's nonfiction."
2,Shame on GSI,I had a Lexan version of this for two years. Then I decided to purchase this one. BIG mistake!!! The Lexan 33oz. java press plunger piece kept breaking. So did the one for the GSI Glacier Stainless Steel Java Press. The only good thing is that I could easily call GSI for replacement parts at no charge even with the shipping.I honestly thought that the stainless steel version would have a fully stainless steel plunger. I'd say for GSI to take this design back to the drawing board.I would not recommend this to anyone until the plunger design is changed.
4,Great Press,We have had this press for over 5 years and still works perfectly. Great for camping or travel (can't trust cabins and hotels to always have coffee). It Has taken quite a beating and still holds up strong. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is that I wish the whole assembly was stainless. I think the plastic lid is a tad cheesy but for us 5 years strong with no broken parts. Would recommend it to anyone.
2,Nice concept - but flimsy plastic plunger filter didn't hold up,"The product worked very well for a couple of weeks, but I have had to send it back. The plastic filter on the end of the plunger is very flimsy. It works its way loose easily when rinsing, and a piece of the plastic cracked off underneath where the rod screws in. It is a real shame GSI hasn't seen fit to put a stronger filter in this otherwise very nice press."
3,"Great Coffee, but...","This French Press makes excellent coffee and it's great for camping, but the screen was damaged when it arrived. After a pleasant call to customer support, they sent a new screen."
3,GREAT COMPANY POOR PRODUCT,"I hate to have to write this because this has got to be one of the best customer service companies in America. If you want great customer service communication and support then this is the product for you. However, the plunger is horrible and the design may never work to standards. Nothing will replace the old fashion wire mesh plunger. The GSI plungers all allow grounds to escape around the plunger and find it's way into your cup. Love the company hate the product. sorry"
2,We returned this,"We returned to Amazon and got a full refund. Thank you Amazon. First it came plopped in a box, rolling around with absolutely no padding. Then the top was hard to get on (not sure if it was damaged in transit?). But overall for the price, this product is very flimsy construction and it wouldn't have lasted for more than a few uses."
4,no breaking this!,"Full proof from husband's clumsiness. Perfect. Does not really keep it hot for long, but, hey....there is the microwave, no?"
3,The Day I Died,"Thought this would be something else, not so much about the lessons he learned but about diing and heaven. Didn't finigh the book."
2,Too Religious,I feel this book had some interesting sections but was too religious for me. I did find some of the bible references to be interesting but i would not read this again.
1,Not What It Seems To Be,This is not really a book about a near death experience. It is more like a endless litany of this mans life experiences mixed with sermons. I didn't finish the entire book. The writing style was annoying as it was written like a verbal conversation. It was not what I expected and not what I wanted.
3,"The Day I Died, An Unforgettable Story.",The book was not what I expected. I expected more details of his efterdeath experiences.
4,i can relate,"I can relate to a lot of this book. We don't always know why things happen, bad things that is, and god doesn't always take away the pain. I guess part of me wanted to see the opposite. I felt somewhat disappointed in the end, but also encouraged ,that this man marches on and now cherishes every moment of life."
2,Not as advertised,This is not a book about life after death. Very disappointing. It is not about anything he saw. It repeated things over and over again. Would not recommend this book to anyone else.
2,Misleading Title,"The title implies that the book will be about his experience on the day he 'died' during the time he was dead, but it is actually about his life afterwards in recovery from a botched surgery. I loved his brilliant Conspiracy of Kindness, but this book's actual topic didn't interest me."
2,Did not finish reading it,I wanted to read about Sjogren's experience that he had. It just did not hold my attention. I was disappointed in it. I gave it to the thrift store.
2,Mistitled...,"Seems misleading to me... The story tells of the author's near death experience, which is not very deep at all, then uses the rest of the book to describe how it changed his life. Pretty thin in that way - similar to the limitations of ""90 minutes in Heaven."""
3,Easter Worship? Who was being worshipped?,"I was a little confused in reading this book, although I found it compelling on a number of levels. On the author's return to his church on Easter Sunday, who was being worshipped?"
5,Tragedy into blessings,God is always more awesome then we could ever imagine. Having suffered through some tragedy myself I can relate to God's amazing grace upon us. This book will bring you through tragedy and all that is good in life through Jesus Christ our savior.May God Bless You Always
5,Man you have to read this,"This book has been read with such eager enthusiasm in our house, it is a truly life changing book and will challenge your views on life, death and everything in between. I would say this is essential reading, especially if you have a fear of death (and thats almost all of you!)"
1,A dishonest title.,"The author doesn't discuss his ""near death experience,"" merely uses the book as an opportunity to air his very conservative views on euthenasia. I feel I wasted my money."
3,Good Book -- Misleading Title,"It seems to me that the subtitle of the book (Life After Death) would have been a better title than 'The Day I Died.' I was expecting Steve to share a lot more than he did about the 'afterlife.' Instead, he shares how he got on with life after coming back from being dead.Is the book good? Absolutely. Could it have been better? Yes, if it had actually talked more about what happened the day he died. In the book Steve tells us that he could share certain things but not others about the afterlife. However, he never seems to get around to things that most people who pick the book up initially really want to know about -- Life after death (not living an earthly life once you've been given a second chance)."
5,The sting of death,"I have read or listened to many accounts of the NDE phenomenon, and this account that Mr. Sjogren gives is one that is unlike any I have come across. I don't want to ruin any part of the story for potential readers, but I will say for those that wonder about the tunnel of light,or the question about loved ones on the other side, this read will give you so much more to think about.I was amazed by what Steve experienced. It wasn't the typical Near Death Experience, by any standard. I read it from start to finish without a break. I was held captive by the ordeal he endured. When it is said, ""well I guess his time was up"" will have an entirely new meaning to the reader. There are moments in this book where I was challenged to shift my paradigm, and other places where I was affirmed. I can reccomend to anyone that has questions about what happens when I die, READ THIS BOOK!! It is worth every moment you will spend reading and discovering just what waits for all of us."
2,Very Poor Sound Quality,"This CD is labeled as remastered, but if this is true then it is certainly the worst remastering job that I have ever heard. I bought this CD because I was looking for a decent Sarah Vaughan compilation that included the song ""The More I See You,"" which I had heard on another jazz compilation. I was delighted when I found this CD because it appeared to be exactly what I was looking for; however, when I received it and listened to the songs, I was put off by the amount of static and the ""far away"" sound of Sarah's voice, like she is singing through thick fog or at the bottom of a well. I realize that these are old songs and some amount of static is to be expected, but I've heard better remastering of older songs than what I heard on this CD. The sound quality is so poor as to be distracting. With so many Sarah Vaughan compilations out there, you'd be safe to pass on this one."
1,not same color as at manicurist,"I purchased three bottles. I had been using same color at my manicurist's shop. But when I brought it to her, the colors were different. The three I bought were darker than the color she carried, though both were O.P.I. and had the same name. I wrote to OPI to ask if they changed the color and they said no.This is an okay color but too dark for me. Don't know what the problem is, but I was very disappointed."
4,NO RESPONSE,"AFTER PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT FOR A GIFT, I FOUND IT TO BE TO SMALL. I HAVE E-MAILED THE COMPANY TO TRY AND EXCHANGE IT WITHOUT A RESPONSE IN 5 WEEKS."
3,Kind of disapointing...,"I've heard a few leaked tracks from this album, and I have to say I am disapointed. Daft Punk's new sound seems to be pretty boring and repetative.Hopefully what I've heard is not the finished product."
2,I'm a HUGE Robert Cray fan but ...,"... this CD was very disappointing. Way too mellow. Many of the songs were indistinguishable. I'd like to see Robert Cray return to the creative fire of his earlier blues works, away from the easy listenin' R&B sound. It worked on ""Sweet Potato Pie"", but his last 2 releases are too far down this road. Go back to hard driving blues with some edge - please!"
2,Shoulda Been Good,"Sondie said it well. Ever since going to Ryko, Mr. Cray has been releasing what sounds like out-takes to me. Very mellow and repetitive with no flare and nothing to make me remember these drones. I love Robert Cray's music and hurts to say that his last two releases (Take Your Shoes Off) have been major dissapointments; in fact, these jumped out of my rack and into the trade-em-in shop within a week - and this provided some insight; gee folks, if this is such a great cd, why can I buy it for three bucks in perfect shape and choose from several copies in the trade em in shop just a couple of weeks after this release? Ouch babe! If you don't have ""I Was Warned"", get it."
2,BORING,"I have several recordings by Robert Cray, and after hearing the first cut on the album, I was looking forward to hearing more. I was very disappointed. This was the most laidback and unemotional set of blues tunes I have ever heard. I hope his next cd is much better. This one did not move."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a huge Robert Cray fan, but this album was a big disappointment. There is a distinct lack of the fire and passion that is present in his other albums. There is very little soloing on Robert's part. Overall, it has a very pedestrian going-through-the-motions feel to it. I've listened to it four or five times, and it is just not in the same league with his previous albums. I can't recommend it. I would recommend his other albums, including Bad Influence, False Accusations, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, Strong Persuader, and Shame + A Sin."
2,Where has the old Cray band gone?,"This ones for you if you like a soft and over-produced sound. I want to like Cray's last 2 albums SO badly. But mostly, they are uninspiring. The whole Mephis-roots sound is interesting but the result is a muffled sound by producer Steve Jordan. I mean can he drown out Kevin Hayes' drums more. I think not. Listen to the rocking and original Sweet Potato Pie and Some Rainy Morning. Then listen to this bland drivel. Have I made myself clear."
5,his best yet,"shoulda been home is robert's best cd yet. a perfect follow up to take your shoes off. great songs, terrific vocals and amazing guitar. best tracks...anytime, help me forget, far away, already gone. pick up this disc and if you get a chance to see robert and his band this summer. run don't walk!"
2,Not in stated condition!,"This book was stated to be in GOOD condition. I received the book fast, which is great, but when I opened it I was not happy! The cover is bent and torn. The first couple pages are hanging on by threads and one is completely removed from the book! On top of that some one had spilled coffee or tea all over it! Good is NOT the condition it should be placed under, it should have been labeled fair!"
1,"Infant and toddler, 5th edition","It was the wrong edition, so this book is not doing me any good. The description of it didn't have what edition it was."
3,Good product,"The Reebok core board is very well constructed. I thought that it came with an instructional video. Instead it only came with a sheet that did not give very good directions on how to use it. I have searched the internet and found on other sites that it should indeed come with a video. That is the only disappointing thing about the product,as first time users such as myself look for either a diagram with excersises for this product or a video to show you the various uses for it."
1,Total piece of junk.,"I've used this router exactly 3 times in the past 6 years. Each session has been no longer than 10 minutes, with light work jobs (door hinges). 2 of the 3 times the on/off switch failed. I have to take it in to a repair shop to replace the switch / diagnose the thing. It's now cost me more to repair it than it did to buy it. When it actually works, it did a fine job. Recommend avoiding this router, which I see is now unavailable."
1,piece of junk,i have owned this router for two years and in the first 6 months the plastic knob to lock height adjustment stripped had to replace with a metal wing nut.the router will no longer hold itself in any plunge position without manually pushing down while routing.too much plastic parts that strip out. i have its bigger brother 3 1/4 hp plunger and it is a much better router well worth spending extra $ for.this router basically is a $150 dust collecter sitting on the shelf.
4,Excellent first achievement,"*The Man Within* follows a fellow named Andrews through his horrifying experiences of paranoia and self-doubt, made all the worse by the fact that some people want to kill him. Andrews is wanted by the police in connection to the murder of an officer, pursued by his former co-smugglers because of his betrayal, and loathed by the locals because of his testimony against a group of popular criminals. There is only one person - the angelic Elizabeth - who provides him with any support, but she also creates for Andrews his biggest dilemma: to face death for someone whom he may never be able to love, or to find a new life, but without the one person who would make it worth living.The writing does not show Greene at his peak, but it does demonstrate an early ability to craft brilliantly complicated characters and problems of morality in a manner similar to Dostoevsky.."
4,A classic Greene novel,"The Man Within is a fantastic book about love and fear. It has elements of action, courtroom drama and good old-fashioned romance. The main character constantly assures us that he is a coward and unworthy of the love given him by the farm girl Elizabeth and also of his former associate whom he betrays in the begining of the book, yet he continues to perform uncharacteristic acts of bravery. His motives for these acts of bravery bring into question the true nature of courage and greatness. This book is surprising at every turn and yet every event, and every conversation makes total sense. It's a difficult book to put down, and you'll probably want to read it again."
4,No issues,No issues it worked great. Seems to be made well and no issues with the signal. I would buy this again.
3,Good for purpose,"This cable met my needs, but it might not meet yours. It leaks a lot of signal, so might not be useful for your cable or satellite box."
5,First Time,"I never though that I would ever buy a Monster cable. Every time I needed a cable the price comparisons had Monster very far higher than any other supplier. However, the price of this 50 foot cable seemed reasonable so I made the purchase. Delivery was excellent. The cable has nice fexibility. The gold-plated connectors are a bit on the large side but are very easy to use. The picture quality is better than expected. Overall this has been a pleasant surprise and a good choice."
5,Perfect,This cost next to nothing and is extremely well made and perfect for giving me cable in my dorm room where the jack is on the other side of the room.
2,This product is overrated,"This product is overrated. I compared this coax cable with a regular (no brand) type of coax cable on my HDTV and I do NOT notice any difference in picture and sound quality. The construction of the cable is great though.Lastly, the head of the coax cable DOES NOT have the ""THX"" symbol. So this cable could be fake.I will just assume I wasted $10, because returning is such a hassle."
5,HIGH QUALITY 50 Foot Coaxial Cable,I have it hooked up to my bedroom LCDTVLG 37LG50 37-Inch 1080p LCD HDTVfrom my living room digital antenna. The digital picture is crystal clear.
4,Good cables.,"Generally I don't buy Monster products because they're overpriced for absolutely no reason. However, this was the cheapest non-crappy 50ft coax cable I could find (except on monoprice, but the fact they they were recently hacked doesn't sit well in my stomach). There is very little signal degredation, the fittings are very high quality feeling also. No complaints about this purchase."
4,Good enough,"What's there to say, it's a coax cable. I have always avoided buying from Monster in the past because they typically tend to be overpriced. However, in my search for a 50' coax cable, it just so happened that this one was the cheapest, so I got it. The signal quality has been good so far. My only complaint is that the shield around the end is almost too big, and I actually had to open up one of the holes in my wall in order to accommodate it."
2,WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BOTTOM????,"I bought this bag about 5 years ago and loved it! I work as an industrial mechanic in a soda pop plant. My old bag has a very heavy RUBBER bottom that I could sit anywhere and not worry about getting the bottom all wet. It finally wore out and I went to buy another and it come with a wimpy lousy vinyl bottom that certainly won't stand up like the old one. The new one doesn't sit up well either. It just slouches over. What a disappointment from the old one! By the way, the picture on this website is of the old bag, not the new one that I got in the mail. The hopalong bag has the same crappy bottom, as I tried them both. I sent it back."
1,Don't buy it!,"I bought this bag to replace the same bag that I bought a few years ago. Bucket boss must have ""upgraded"" their products because what I received is junk! The picture on this site is what it used to look like. The new one does not have a hard bottom, the sides do not stand up by themselves, and the material itself is maybe half the thickness of what I had before. If this is representative of Bucket boss quality, they lost me as a customer after many years of happiness! I'm returning this one immediately!"
2,Won't stand up straight,"I picked this bag because of the rave reviews and because my old bag wouldn't stand up straight anymore. Well, this bag won't stand up straight either and it's brand new. What a pain!"
2,decrease in quality as expected,"II owned this bag from many years back. I LOVE IT. Unfortunately my acid flux destroyed it. I bought this new one. So disappointed. No rubber reinforced bottom. Thinner material. No reinforcement in side walls. Skinny little handles. If I wasn't so stuck in my ways I would have returned, but I really like the layout. I'm going to put leather on the bottom and make some sheet metal boxes to slide inside the large compartments. Shame on American companies for being stingy on products they already manufacture out of the country. BUY AMERICAN whenever you can!"
1,Bucket Boss Went Cheapo,I have bought and worn out two of the 06088 tool bag as a service plumber since 2003. The newest version of this bag is a lightweight imposter for the rough duty bag it used to be. It no longer has a rubber bottom to protect surfaces and is made of a material that isn't even as strong as most camera bags. Without the rubber bottom it now slides all around my service van-Ahhhhhhhhh. The cheapo who spec'd the new bag should be fired. Not the high quality anymore.
2,"OK, not great","This caddie does carry your stuff, but it's pretty darn ugly. The logo is huge across the front and not cute."
5,"For Real Fans Only, Great For Many Uses","the thing about this soundtrack is that it is not just a game soundtrack, it could work as a halloween party soundtrack, or something like that.the re4 tracks are seriously boring but the rest of the cd is wonderful, and if u played the game, you'll get flashbacks.i do not recommened this for begginers, or rookies in this game, its seriously for fans only, concidering the connection of the music with the game itself.ps: for ipod users and such, the artist in this cd is Soundtrack, so it will be really annoying if u have more than one cd with such artist label."
4,Very good soundtrack CD,"I'm a big fan of Resident Evil games, and decided to buy this soundtrack. The CD has 48 soundtracks including Resident Evil zero, 1, 2, 3, Code Veronica, and 4.Some of the music were good in that CD such as Krauser, Final Battle, Lament (Success), Lullaby, the theme of Alexia, Murderous eyes, The suspended doll, Piano roll, Infants, and The last escape. The other music sound tracks were not my favorite.Unfortunately, the CD did not include the song where Alexia sings the theme of Infants. It did not also include the music the prologue of Code Veronica.Overall, the CD is worth buying."
5,Awesome,"I always been fond of the RE franchise nowasays 'cause of the drama, horror, and adventure it embodies, especially the older games. This album brings quite a variety to the table (metaphorically speakin'). And a 10th anniversary to 6 RE games- that's sayin' a lot. If you a big RE fan, get this collection! 'Nuff said."
3,ONLY FOR TRUE RESI FANS,GOOD CD BUT ONLY A REAL DIE HARD FAN WILL RECONIZE ALL THE MUSIC AND EVEN THEY MIGHT NOT KNOW EVEY ONE. ALSO ALTHOUGH THE ARE 40+ SONGS/TUNES ON CD A LOT OF THEM ARE ONLY A FEW SECONDS (SOME APPROX 10-15 SECONDS)LONG AND ARE OVER BEFORE THEY REALLY GET STARTED THIS WITH ALSO THE FACT THAT EVEN WITH THE VOLUME UP HIGH ON CD PLAYER TRACKS ARE RECORDED SO LOW THAT THEY ARE OVER BEFORE YOU CAN HEAR THEM PROPERLY. THATS WHY I THINK THIS JUST SCRAPED BY WITH 3 STARS. ONCE AGAIN ONLY FOR REAL RESI FANS.
3,Good CD.Dennis Chambers is amazing...,I bought this CD two years ago and after a while I was trully loving it.After listening to this record one's must admit that Dennis Chambers is definitely one of the best drummers now a days.The way he plays on track number 3 is really impressive.Anyone who likes the drums MUST buy this CD.
1,PRICE IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE! (the tea itself is nice),"This is a nice tea, but who in their right mind would pay this price--as of the writing of this review $41.95 for two boxes of 25 K-Cups --so puleeez -- DON'T pay it!!! It's nearly TWICE what the price should be--I am not joking about this. I know my K-Cups. And also, pay attention to the fact it is coming from a NON-AMAZON store, so you will also be paying shipping on top of everything else! Look elsewhere for this product, because the tea itself is very nice --hopefully AMAZON will get it in stock and sell it themselves rather than outsourcing."
3,Go Directly to the Kuerig Site to order..price here is too much.,"Go to [...] to order these. The price there is [...] for a box of 24. If you order 4 packages of kcups, you get free shipping. If you sign up for their mail notifications (join their coffee club.) you'll get 10 to 15 percent off. They ship rather quickly. But, if you want this tea for winter, you better order quickly because it tends to sell out around Christmas time or Thanksgiving. I like the Mandarin Spice, and the Lemon Zinger. All together, for 4 packages of tea (48 kcups of Mandarin, and 48 kcups of Lemon Zinger, my total was [...] My only problem with the Kuerig site is that it is not too user friendly. Go to ""at home"" and then ""shop"" and you should find everything you need :)"
3,Didn't like the subtitles,"Many others have reviewed this film pretty well here. I think they're pretty accurate -- it's a fantastic film. I'll just mention the subtitles here, on the import version. Someone else seemed to like them a lot (finding them humorous), but I thought the fairly bad translation to English was distracting. Too much of it was in the vein of ""All your base are belong to us."" I'll be looking into the U.S. version when it's released on DVD, which I assume will have a better translation."
3,Interesting,"My impression of this movie was not a comedy, but interesting, like pictures of space from NASA. If you have ever fantasied about the ultimate sports team, this movie hits the target. Some scenes are ridiculous --- launching a soccer ball with cannon force from one's abdomen. I wished for more ""real"" martial arts mixed with soccer, but the extemes have a place in such a movie/fantasy. The children and I both enjoyed the movie, but after watching it twice, we skip all the talk and watch only the training and soccer scenes."
1,Bad Movie,"Maybe someone will like this movie out there, not me... I have no clue where they were going with it, it is not in English, and it is just a bad movie. Someone had recommended it to me because I like soccer, but it has nothing to do with soccer."
2,slightly disappointed,"i bought this movie after being blown away by the actor/director's masterpiece, Kung Fu Hustle.while it contains similar humor elements and near-anime-type action, it's really not worth the buy, and you would be better served by purchasing Kung Fu Hustle which is much funnier and overall a better production. i probably watch Kung Fu Hustle once every couple of months, which is no small complement."
1,"Just not my thing, I guess.","I tried, really I did. I managed to sit through 52 minutes and 14 seconds of this movie before I just couldn't force myself to watch anymore.It started out really promising, and I was getting into it, thinking if it started out OK it might just get better as time went on. It really had the potential to be hysterical, but it just got more and more absurd, and I was no longer amused.Even my husband, who was certain beyond all doubt that he would love it, was begging me to turn it off.Sorry if some of you will feel the need to slam me for this, but I'm just being honest. I hated this movie. I liked the first 10-15 minutes, and then I just HATED it. Maybe I should watch the dubbed version instead of the subtitles... or maybe I shouldn't waste any money. I rented this with a free rental coupon, and it's a good thing, 'cause I would have been pretty ticked to have lost money AND 52 minutes of my life."
2,"Read this, then decide","This was to be a present for my 3 soccer-playing children; they saw the trailers for the American PG release, but we didn't get a chance to see it in theaters. I decided NOT to let the two younger children watch this DVD after previewing it with my sensitive 13-year-old.This DVD version is subtitled (very poorly i.e. ""kick the soccer"" referring to the soccer BALL, etc., and some of the translation doesn't make any sense.) There is a lot of footage of adults grovelling at the feet of bad-guys and taking a lot of (depressing) abuse. There are smokers, drunks, and the ""Evil Team"" soccer players are injected with HUGE amounts of drug to be powerful.There is some humor, but not enough. The good parts are at the very end in the soccer tournament; the Shaolin-style is fun to watch, like in ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"".This may be your thing, but I didn't know what I was getting, so I wanted to make sure others do!"
4,hilarious,"This movie is a new generation of the Chinese comedy, I enjoyed a lot watching this movie as well as Stephen Chow new movie Kung Fu Hustle which it is funny as hell."
5,Shaolin is Great!,"This is the most entertaining movie ive seen in a while. It has tons of humour and maybe a bit excessive special effects but that only makes it better!. One great thing was that it wasnt dubbed, at least not my version. anyway, I highly recommend this to anyone who likes soccer, because this is what true soccer is, this is Shaolin Soccer!!!Whatever you do, go see it!!!"
4,Ridiculous nonsense. Great way to waste some time,"There were several scenes in Shaolin Soccer that had me laughing and gaping in disbelief. This flick is truly bizarre. It does have its own distinctive style, but that style is so exaggerated, so over the top, so inexplicably weird, that it may lose some viewers. To me, it is this sense of ""anything goes"" that puts this fantasy movie a step above most others.If you thought the preview looked good, check it out. It's better than you think."
4,Fun for all!,A silly movie on martial arts masters playing soccer with lots of action. Give it five stars if you like Kung Fu Hustle or martials arts classics.
4,"Entertaining, but could have used a little more action","First off, I'm going to agree with pretty much everyone here, the scenes with Kung Fu are done excellently. The effects, although ridiculous are quite cool.Now my (minor) gripes:- There's no way to skip to the menu while the disc is initially loading. This isn't a big deal the first time, but it does get kind of annoying to have to sit through the warnings and logo screens.- The story kind of falls over itself towards the end. That might be kind of predictable given that this team would have destroyed everyone in the competition, but it kind of betrays the point of these guys playing together (to spread the word about Shaolin kung fu) when it looks like every team but the scrubs knows a little kung fu.Other than that though, it is quite fun to watch."
3,not sure how I feel about this movie,"I watched the chinese version (with english subtitles) with my wife thinking that this was going to be your basic silly kung fu/soccer movie. I WAS that but it also had times of senseless violence and humiliation. (didn't see the Americanized version). The character of the sweet bun girl morphed from shy, unattractive to overdone to bald goalie. Since I'm not chinese, maybe this stuff is really funny on the main land but it was lost on me. Some genuinely funny parts and great special effects but keep in mind, it is mixed."
4,Loved it,"Loved this movie the first time I saw it. I let a friend borrow it and they never gave it back. The great thing about this new version is that it is dubbed. Even though the subtitled version is a little different it does make for easier viewing. The subtitled version is available on this disc too.Great movie. Funny, quirky, not the norm."
4,Funny Foriegn film,"Saw part of this on TV, and wanted to watch the other half. The special FX are corny as all get out, but that makes it funnier. It's a typical HEA storyline, but a good one worth watching at least once or twice."
5,goofy crazy cool,Kung Fu Hustle was a piece of trash....Shaolin Soccer is a whole different story. If you like just random fun and you want a good laugh then get this
5,A lauriat of laughs,"Combining kung fu mysticism with soccer, sprinkled with sight gags and spoofs from popular Hollywood and Hong Kong movies, Shaolin Soccer is a very enjoyable movie. Stephen Chow leads a very funny ensemble cast which includes a deglamorized Zhao Wei.Sure, the plot is well within the Bad News Bears/Replacements genre but what makes it unpredictable are the off-the-wall humor and overall tongue-in-cheek treatment of the director.If you see this on DVD, buy it. Because one viewing isn't enough to capture all the hilarious scenes like the Face/Off like entry of the team members on the rooftop, the musical number where pedestrians join the action and acts as if nothing happened when it's over, and of course, the game antics of the two rivals.A big hit here in Asia, this is probably the most underexposed comedy in the US. Whether you're a soccer, kung-fu or comedy fan or not, you'll have a kickin' good time with Shaolin Soccer."
5,Traditions+Technologies+Stephen=Funny Movie,This is an awsome movie from Stephen Chow. Visually it's pleasing to the creative eyes. Sound separation is much better than most Hong-Kong-originated movies. Must See!!!!
4,A funny Kung-Fu meets Sports film,"This movie is funny and never stops from being entertaining. I laughed the whole way through. The story isnt want i remember as much as the jokes and the way over-the-top action. They kung-fu action gets a little silly at times instead of amazing, but I can forgive that since this movie has a light hearted theme and great cast including zhou wei(so close, warriors of heaven and earth) who plays a cinderella-type girl who is always over looked. This movie isnt perfect, but it is a great movie for people who like comedies, kung-fu movies, and sports movies."
5,Great Soccer Tutorial!,"Before you watch this movie, here are two things you'll need:1) A Sense of humor. We know the cliché, ""Everybody's a comedian"", but if you're someone who doesn't feel like humor surrounds you every where you go every day, you most likely don't have the sense of humor required to appreciate the humor of this flick.B) The ability to read. DO NOT watch the U.S. version. It really doesn't do the movie justice. The translation of the subtitles aren't great, but it is a waaay better movie.Got those two checked? Then enjoy the movie with a loved one or a kidnapping victim (for you serial killers out there)."
1,The stupidest movie I've seen in my life,"Thanks goodness I rented this movie instead of buying it. It is so stupid. The characters over-exaggerate their emotions of sadness and joy, but not in a funny way.A couple of times during the movie, the characters start to sing and dance, as if this were a musical.Another reviewer made the mistake of comparing this to the movie Kung Pow. I own Kung Pow and I can honestly say that it is 100 times better than Shaolin Soccer."
1,Worst movie ever,"This is by far the worst movie i have ever seen. I mean yeah it had a weak plot and u can obviously see the bad vs evil, but the jokes are extremely corny and the exaggeration is not even funny. Please do yourself a favor and dont even bother renting this piece of junk. I kept watching in hopes just to see if the movie would improve with time and it just kept getting worst. It was a complete waste of time."
1,The Worst Movie--perhaps EVER!,"This movie is repulsive, vulgar, boring, and completely illogical. I know this is supposed to be a ""funny"" movie, but it's merely a rubbish heap of failed jokes and sight gags. In fact, this movie is so bad that it creates a black hole, into which all other movies are sucked and destroyed."
1,Shaolin Soccer,"We ordered the DVD Shaolin Soccer and it would NOT play in English NOT even when we selected the english version. We saw the movie on TV and it was in english, but when we got the DVD and tried to play it, it was only in Chineese. The english version would not play. I was very disapointed because I could not hear it in English. Is there a way for you to send me another copy and could you play it first to make sure that it is in english? I would rate this item a 0"
4,Shaolin Soccer,"A little scratched up, but it's acceptable. Shipping was fast. The resolution of the video feels a bit off than a regular DVD but no big deal."
3,Shaolin Soccer...,"A fun movie! I actually liked it! The Special Effects were also good! If you can get it cheap, do so and have fun watching it! Three stars!"
3,Another funny Stephen Chow movie,"I compare this movie to ""Kung-Fu Hustle"". It is done in the same style with similar results. This movie fuses kung-fu with comedy and is definitely a welcome addition to my collection. However, it is not as funny, the action is not as good, and the story is not as compelling as ""Kung-Fu Hustle"". A slightly better-than-average movie."
5,Great foreign movie!,"this was one of the greatest Asian or foregin films I've ever seen! Every time I watch it it just gets me laughing. I highly recommend to anyone to watch this film, they will get a ""kick"" out of it. (haha)"
3,laugh your *** off,this was great at 3 am- don't know if it's as good when you are really awake!It's crouching tiger hidden dragon merged with soccer and a lame underdogs triumph blend.I sent it to my nephew for a break from college studies.
1,?,i love the movie was disapointed it didn't come in it's original case but overall good moviemy husband will love it
3,p140,the stories didn't make sense-----The Teacher was likable but i didn'tlike the plot-----the pick-up was a bummer
1,I know it's supposed to be a cool cult classic...,"But that doesn't mean that these movies don't suck. I saw the Tarantino/Rodriguez Grindhouse movie and loved the whole thing so much that I thought I'd give a real grindhouse movie a chance. Honestly, this was painful. I couldn't possibly recommend it to anybody. I really do get that this is supposed to represent some kind of ""experience,"" but in all fairness, stubbing your toe counts as an experience, too. I would put this movie somewhere between stubbing your toe and having your eyes gouged out."
2,Blaah!,"I bought this film because I am a fan of Shah Rukh Khan and I knew he did a cameo in this film. He appears at the beginning of the film to introduce it. That part was done very candidly. It was fun to see him. During the film, Shah Rukh Khan's name was mentioned once or twice. The film itself leaves much to be desired. It was tedious for me to watch (I was only watching it to look for Shah Rukh Khan). I don't recommend this film."
3,GUDGUDEE has a very funny plot,"GUDGUDEE has a very funny plot that sadly enough begins to sag in the middle. The movie runs purely on the acting of Anupam Kher and the dazzling Pratibha. She is truley spectacular and has a flair for comedy. She also looks very beautiful throughout the film. Anupam is excellent, as usual and performs very well indeed as an naive and idiotic buisnessman. Jugal Hansraj gives a nice portrayal as a struggling singer who is madly inlove with Pratibha. Bappi Lahiri's music is very nice. Some musibal gems of the movie are ""HAR PAL CHAHE MEA DIL"" and ""BIKHIRI HUI CHANDINI"". The ""MAIN TO PRITAM KO"" sequence is very funny.This film is watchable for its performances and music."
4,in europe with clapton,it is a same americans did not appreciate there original rock and roll stars and did'nt compensate them equally to there white acts so much was lost to early death from the lack of money I have been listen to the blues all my life but colleting only since i was 17 (i'm 35 now) but i lost a lot of music in flood and now i'm trying to replace some of the lost tapes the first blues album i purchased was sonnyboy's down and out and there was a song on that album that never shows up on any greatest hits the title is wakeup explain yourself anyway i guest i'll just have to purchase it again p.s. if you want the most awesome high from music listen to the drum on sad to be lonesome by sonnyboythanks jesse d. dj priest
1,Remake Los Solitarios y Los Pasteles Verdes,"Los Babasonicos han pasado de ser una propuesta interesante del rock argentino ha ser una caricatura de los Pasteles Verdes o Los Solitarios (Grupos románticos de los setenta). En su afán por imitar caen en cancioncitas demasiado cursis y hasta sin sentido, los casos son varios: ""puntita"", ""putita"", ""Irresponsables"", ""Y qué"", son ejemplos de dicho re-make de grupos setenteros. Que si bien no son malas canciones si carecen de una propuesta novedosa por parte de un grupo que prometía otra dirección. La salida fácil siempre han sido las baladitas, si no pregúntenle a músicos de la talla de Bryan Adams, Scorpions, Aerosmith y una larga lista de rockers de grandes pelos de los ochenta y noventa. La pregunta es si los babasonicos continuarán con dicha broma o de plano ya se sienten los hijos putativos de los pasteles y demás grupos románticos de los setenta."
3,A usefull reference - but far from complete and not always accurate,"A good reference for beginners in flash.Plenty of useful information. Most of it is pretty easy to digest. Some info though, I found to be inaccurate or misleading, so I would certainly not recommend that this be your only reference!!!Also, the author seemed to have a hard time writing more then two sentences without some sort of attempt to be clever or funny. I find this pretty annoying.I recommend learning Flash from a variety of sources. This could be one of those sources, but again, I don't recommend that you trust it too much."
1,Book tutorials are soooo yesterday...,"First of all this book is written for Flash 8 - not CS3 or CS4. So this book is antiquated. Second of all I just ordered a 4 hour training disc that makes it sooo much faster and easier to learn and understand Flash. It's like sitting in a classroom and learning from a teacher, only better and at your own pace. I am officially done reading books. From now on it's video tutorials on disc. They're more expensive but WELL worth it, and you can just resell them on Amazon."
3,Can't Top the Legends,"Limited budgets are reflected in this duo reunion, as nearly all the keyboards sound like stock leftovers from the late 80s. Rod Argent tries gamely to bring the arrangements into the 00s, and Blunstone demonstrates a set of high pipes that clearly defy his age, but Out of the Shadows doesn't quite move out of the shadows of the duo's creative progenitors, the Zombies or Argent. It's tough to surpass one's own legend."
2,Disappointed,"I am a huge Zombies/Colin Blunstone fan. The Odyssey and The Oracle is a masterpiece. But the qualities that made the Zombies great are largely absent here. No haunting melodies; no breathy vocals and very little great organ work by Rod. The songs have embarrasing lyrics filled with strung together cliches. The melodies could have come off of a midwestern bar band's failed demo tape. ""Home"", the opening track , gives hope for the project...but is the only decent song on this disappointing disc. Save your money."
1,I was shocked!,"I bought the CD knowing the CD-Box ""Zombie Heaven"" with all that brilliant songs in it. I thougt if somebody like Rod wrote wonderful songs one time he could repeat that 30 years later. But he did not! He copied AOR of the late 80's put some Colin in and in the end it has nothing to do with intelligent songwriting. I think Rod run out of ideas, maybe he didnt fell in love for a long time or the songs were composed dead. And what has Russ Ballard to do with all that? Nothing interesting came from his site and I believe that he only gave his name. Sorry, but I'm very sad to say so."
5,Very Touching and Faithful to the Show,"""Knights of the Morningstar"" tells the story of another leap where Sam runs into the ""Evil Leaper,"" Alia, in between the two encounters shown in the series. The story between them makes for a nice interlude between those episodes, but for me, the best part of the book was the reappearance of Donna, Sam's wife. This was the first of the Quantum Leap books to use her as a character, and considering that we only got to see the adult Donna once on the show, the opportunity to see her was a welcome one. The revealing of her emotions while she waits for her husband to return made this a very moving story. A must-read for all Leapers."
4,Love is in the Pages,"Fate sometimes takes away the one you think you loved most, but it is really making space for the true companion. In Remember, Nicki Wells is devastated by the ""suicide"" of her fiance for many years until she discovers love right under her nose- Clee Donovan. After an affair in Provence (and an obvious change in just a business-only relationship), Nicki Wells discovers that Charles, her fiance is not necessarily dead."
5,Touched my heart,"I enjoyed reading this book. It delt with a subject that touched my heart- the issue of child abuse, but not in a way where you were depressed and sad throughout the whole book. The author developed the characters very well and even added a slight bit of romance to the story. I would recommend this book to my friends."
1,Ragged pages...,"Verl is a somewhat believable character grossly miscast as some semi-interesting man out to solve a cold case. I pictured Barnaby Jones and got Bruce Dern. The tale holds promise and the writer should be lauded for her energy in delivering this book. But there is a clear reason why it is not published by a major publisher, and that is the downfall. The Ten Commandmands written on 25% cotten blend paper would not be the same as the Ten Commandmands written in stone. I would like to see this story handled by a good editor. A few paragraphs are superfluous and the tear-jerking parts are gratuitous. Nice try, but no banana..."
1,Disturbing!,"This book made me so sad. I'm sorry I read the darn thing to be completely honest, I thought by the title and the description on the jacket of the book I was buying something totally different than what I got. The story was chocked-full of editing mistakes which only made matters worse for me and with the story line being one of child abuse rather than mystery I am going to demand a full refund! I hate stories like this one where the writer tries to cash in on the abuse of a small child. It's almost like this child's loss was this writer's gain. A chilling thought! Needless to say I will not be buying any more books by Ms. Vickie Adkins anytime soon."
3,A classic commentary on the commandments of God,"Maimonides, better known as Rambam, is truly on of the great commentators of the Torah. This two-volume set meticulously goes through each of the 613 commandments of God with commentary on the importance of each. The reading is very dry, but this set provides a handy reference."
3,"Good, but could be better","If you are looking for a step-by-step grooming procedure on different breeds of dogs, then this is a great book for you. The diagrams are helpful, and the directions are easy to follow. The problem I found with the book, is that it did not provide enough information about the clips. Personally, I want to know the reasons behind the different clipping styles, before I use them."
4,Great for the intermediate groomer,"OK, not for the professionals, but I have been grooming in a salon for 3 months and this book is a great help. Step by step without being over-explanatory. The section on poodles is extensive giving many different types of cuts. The pictures give a nice idea of what the standard cuts should look like for the various breeds.It was good for me!"
2,"Beware - do not buy this book and ""All 87 Breed Dog Grooming""",I bought both of these books and it is word for word the same book. This is a good general information book but don't buy both. The other book is half the price - buy that one.
3,Home Grooming,"I was a little disappointed with this book. I expected to see step by step pictures of how to cut a dogs hair and face. I groom at home and have a problem grooming the dogs face without it looking unprofessional. The other pointers and pictures did help as to bathing around the face, using certain size blades, different scissors for different areas of the body, etc."
3,Lack in detail,"The book is ok, it lacked detail. Would of been nice to have step by step insructions with pictures."
1,american show styles- for bitish pets,this book is not for show dogs it is a book on how americans trim there dogs. although the 8/10 thumbs up on the american cocker. the drawings of the dogs were informative but the quality was poor. this book would have been better if they had forcused on the bitish view more. some of the information was incorrect to the british breed standards the english springer (HAVING ONE MYSELF) was completely ruined this is a book i will recomend only to pet owners who want to do weird hair cuts.but all american groomers should welcome it!
4,We love the Backyardigans!,The backyardigans are great!! This dvd isn't one of the best ones.Polka palace isn't that catchy but the other 3 are really good! If you or your kid is a backyardigan fan you need this to complete your collection!
3,Backyardigans Good / DVD Quality Not-so-Good,"I love watching the Backyardigans, so I purchased this DVD. In each of the four episodes, the color of the characters is distorted, making it hard to watch. Uniqua and Austin appear dark red. Tasha appears as light green, and the white areas on Pablo also appear green. It is very distracting."
2,"Only *TWO* (2) episodes, unlike the DVD.","The DVD with the same title supposedly has four Backyardigan's episodes, so I assumed that the VHS did as well. However, this is not the case. So, I can only give this particular product 2 stars.(I chose the VHS version because it was easier to use with my daughter. For example: if she gets a hold of it I don't have to worry about her getting fingerprints all over it.)Otherwise, it's a cute show, and not quite too repetitive, so it is quite tolerable (and even a little bit entertaining) for parents. If it had had the full content from the DVD, I would have given this four or five stars.I'd recommend catching an episode on television to make sure you agree before buying them."
2,Not the best Backyardigans DVD,"i have a 2 year old that is a diehard backyardigans fan. he will sit in one spot without even blinking when the show comes on Nikelodeon in the mornings but for some reason this DVD has failed to capture his attention. i usually enjoy the cartoon as well but this one was boring and the episodes dragged. my son likes songs he can sing along and dance too and the songs featured on this DVD were extremely slow. i absolutly love the show and would recommend it to anymone, but this DVD, i'd say there are much better ones out there. =)"
3,It's exacly what I expected,"We bought this dvd because the ""Polka Palace Party"" was on the ""On Demand"" channels on cable. Meaning, my two girls (twins 14 months) were able to watch this over and over. Thing is, it only runs ""on demand"" for a couple of weeks. So, we decided to buy the dvd. PPP is the best one on the dvd. The songs are really cute and not too annoying. The other ones...well, they get progressively worse as the dvd goes on.But really, what kids' song-type show ISN'T annoying? So, it's worth buying for the first two episodes. More importantly the first one. We even sing the songs to them when it's not on. They're pretty catchy!"
1,Wrong DVD RAM media size,I bought 20 DVD RAM discs for my Panasonic DVD RAM Camera and what I got is a BIG DVD RAM size... what should i do??
2,Very Thick like cardboard,"I did not like these at all. They are very thick and kind of rough. I though after washing they might soften up a bit, but they did not. My father-in-law liked them, but I can't understand why. I would go for the 800 count sheets that were about the same price and felt much better. These might be good for longevity, but only time will tell. Not for you if you are looking for softnesss."
5,More than 25 minutes longer version,"... this unabridged version is ... is more than 25 minutes longer than the 1958 recording by the composer himself. The total time is about 74 minutesIt is superb epic music, of the many compositions Villa-Lobos wrote one of his best! The only thing I don't like are some short wordless vocalises to imitate birds.But the real songs (sung by Renee Fleming or the choir) which appear like intermezzos on certain places in the driving orchestral music are beautiful. The recording was released before in 1996 on another label (Consonance)."
2,This is definitely a pops book,"Cover title is unspecific to genre. The table of contents may lead you to believe you are purchasing music you are not...A lot of these songs are not in their original Spanish or Portuguese although the title may be listed in the original language. Ex: ""Amapola"" is a shortened arrangement of the refrain only...in English. Several songs are shortened versions and poor English translations. Composer and arranger information not even provided sometimes. If you're looking for a casual pops book with some tunes in it, this might be for you. However, if you're looking for quality arrangements of authentic popular Latin songs, stay clear."
3,"Happily Divorced is Okay but if you are looking for The Nanny, It isn't","Having enjoyed ""The Nanny Series"" even as the series endlessly repeats on my screen, I wondered why ""Happily Divorced"" has not aired on television in Hawaii. Having looked at a little more than half the series, I understand. This ain't ""The Nanny."" Fran Dresher's husband admits he's gay. They divorce but continue to live together, neither one dates other people successfully.......over and over again. So far the plot hasn't changed and has become rather redundant. Looking forward to seeing the rest."
5,just love happily divorced,i love my happily divorced season one so awesome if you have not seen this yet you should get it
4,nanny fine nice as always,"loved to hear that ""nanny fine"" got a new show going on.happily divorced is created by her own life! poor fran drescher. had to go through such bad things when she was young.and after such a long marriage really found out that her husband is actually gay and got divorced. after that they created together the show. kinda funny and sad, but she takes it sooooo well.well. if you like comedy and ""nanny fine"" then buy it and ejoy and I hope to see more seasons coming"
1,Ludicrous Price,"It's pretty obvious that this is a required text for a course at a University somewhere, for that's the only thing that could conceivably justify a $120 price on an ebook. The author would do well to discover that there are thousands of people such as myself that would consider such a book at $14.99 and likely increase his sales by a factor of ten or more.The world has changed my friend -- you can sell to people all over the world now at the touch of a button, and they can find your product. There's no additional cost to selling additional copies of ebooks. Quit leaving money on the table.J."
3,Reader sits flush; SD cards do not.,"The version of this SIIG card that Amazon is shipping in late 2009 (""12-IN-1,"" CE-E01012-S1, rev. 02-0393B) is a bit disappointing. The reader itself sits flush with the computer case (MacBook Pro 17"" Unibody), but the SD card still sticks out almost half an inch. I bought this one based on a previous review which stated that the SD card fit flush, too, and that one wouldn't have to worry about it breaking off. Maybe that was true with the ""11-IN-1"" rev. 02-0393A, which is the one that Amazon still has pictured here, but it's not true anymore.For fit with the card, this one is actually worse than the Sonnet card I bought it to replace. Side-to-side play with the card is considerable in the SIIG, while there is practically none with the Sonnet.As a card reader, it seems to work fine. There's simply nothing about it that makes it stand out positively in the crowd."
1,a waste of money,On my Mac Book pro I am unable to use any SD card larger than 512M. Inserting a Larger card generates an over current error message and the entire Express Card Slot is deactivated until the next reboot.
3,"Caution for Lenovo T410s users - Works, but does not fit flush","While the functionality of this SIIG 12-in-1 card is not in question - works as described, easy Win7 recognition and automatically setup,SD card read and write...it does not fit well in the Lenovo T410s model laptop.The T410""S"" is the slim line version of the T410, and as such has a shallower case and a inward bezel at the lower portion of the laptop. Lenovo's design doesn't allow for a flush mount of this card, so you are not likely to leave this card in the ExpressCard/34 slot as it's likely to catch on your case or other items.Even though Lenovo shows the 11-in-1 SIIG card on their accessory website, those looking for a flush fit and to permanently leave this card in their Lenovo T410s, forget it!"
4,Works as advertised,"Good product, but with little or no documentation. Just plug it in, and it works on OS X."
1,xD does NOT work on MacBook Pro,"Works fine with SD cards but Siig support confirmed an issue I was having regarding xD media not mounting on Mac OS X...We did not market this reader/writer for Mac because of compatibilityissues with xD cards in the Mac, there is no fix for this issue.However, we will update to a different version soon that will be fullycompatible in Mac OS 10.4.7 or later."
2,Didn't work on my MacBook Pro,I ordered one and it won't mount my SD card on my MacBook Pro (10.4.7). Disk Utility shows it appearing and disappearing continuously. Don't bet on 100% compatability with this one.
1,Worthless,"Basically someone taped a parade and is selling it.A total RIP OFF!If I could give negative stars, I would.I purchased this for my father's birthday since he's an avid antique car enthusiast and he said, ""It was just a video of some parade.""What a let down..."
3,"Sealed & New, but Missing Pieces","First let me state that I have build one of these models before (I had ordered it directly from Revell's website). That's how I know it was missing pieces. It may have just been a fluke with the one I received, but with it missing pieces, I had to improvise and since I had built this as a Father's Day gift to my dad I won't see much of again, that was kind of a big deal.Other than that, it was a standard build. Very easy to put together (I've been making models for 12+ years now, so that's not saying much). I bought it because I wanted to replicate my dad's truck. It went together relatively smoothly. I'd recommend this to anyone looking to build this particular vehicle.Just my opinion, but the stock version (the one pictured) isn't that great. It's much better to ""make it your own"" by doing it how you want it."
2,Amazon verified purchase...,The pictures of the product are great but its easy to miss in the overall discription that it is a kit....so many parts....no glue....so much work!!
4,Very informative material,"This book is an excellent resource to learn about the greatestrevivals that have taken place in America. It is a good book for thebeginning student of revivals because it gives a somewhat brief overview of these tremendous moves of God without bogging the reader down with a lot of details. However, there are enough details to get a good understanding of each revival. From the Great Awakening to the Revival of 1857-58, this work give a concise description of the majors revivals in American history through the mid 1900s. I will use this book again and again as a refreshing reminder of what God has done and can do through yielded people. ... A very interesting book!"
1,Open Wider,"To match my much loved seatbeltbag, I later bought this wallet. It was a great disappointment as it is very stiff and doesn't open wide enough to easily reach in. The ""piping"" trim flares out making it look cheap. I gave up trying to make it work and it's sitting on my closet shelf. I can use it as a clutch, in a pinch."
4,Lasts while it lasts,This book is great-the first time you read it. It's wonderful for the first time but you won't read it twice because the stories are riddles and once you know the answer it's boring. Just be prepared when you pay.
4,Good video for those thinking about homebirths,"This is a good video for those contemplating a homebirth.There are 2 doctors who give clear and convincing evidence on why a homebirth is safe, more personal, fulfulling and beneficial not only to the mother and baby but the rest of the family as well.There are also several women who recount their experiences with homebirth and having a midwife present as being a safe, normal and natural process than a hospital birth. The one woman's daughters also talk about their experience at being at their mom's homebirth as being very positive.This is not a video showing births after births, if that is what you want.However, there is beautiful water birth included in it that was videotaped by a daughter.Buy this video if you want excellent reasons as to why you and your family should have a homebirth."
4,John Gould was not an artist and did not draw these,"I own many John Gould books including this hummingbird. They are beautiful books but he could not draw. He hired others to do it, often Edward Lear, and erased his name from the drawings. Gould's wife also drew. Gould was a taxidermist and a businessman. Lear was paid cheaply and Gould became rich."
5,Beautiful,"This book is awesome! If you love hummingbirds, you'll love this book!!! Hi gloss pages are *extra* nice. You'll like it."
2,It's OK,"This is OK as a general bike workout. But, if you are more a spinning enthusiast I'm not sure how relevant it is."
3,"I agree with ""thepageturner""","My first reaction when I started reading this book was exactly the same as the first review in the list here. Isaac Stern is a man with many fascinating stories, but in the book they don't have time to breathe. There's little detail, the book jumps from one subject to the next in short, bland paragraphs, and there's little of Stern's wit and insight. We also don't get much about how Stern feels about the music he plays, or the composers who created it. In short, the book skims the surface of a potentially fascinating subject. Pity."
3,Rushed telling of an amazing life,"The best thing about ""My First 79 Years"" is that it put Isaac Stern on book tour. Hearing him in an interview is such a delight; you wish the conversation with this intelligent, charming, generous, and of course, gloriously musical man would go on forever.So why is this book so much less satisfying? Especially when it was co-written with Chaim Potok. Isaac Stern's voice does not seem to shine through, nor does his music. Why does the telling of some of his most remarkable feats (saving Carnegie Hall or visiting closed China) seem flat when they shimmer with excitement when he tells them on radio or film? I hope Isaac Stern lives another 79 years and takes a second crack at recording his remarkable life."
4,A MASTER MUSICIAN TELLING HIS STORY MASTERFULLY,What is involved in playing a musical instrument? What is needed to become really good? How should music affect you? All of these questions are answered very well and many times while reading this book. I welled up with emotion within like you sometimes do while reading the Reader's Digest because of the content. I thought Stern's life was well presented in an interesting manner and with great detail. Anyone interested in classical music should truly enjoy this life story.
1,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!still waiting,"I haven't received it yet, hope it will get here sooner or later...really hope so!!!!"
4,Great for ESL or for teens and up learning Spanish,"I used this for several years in my Adult ESL classes - the words, and matching up the numbers are a little cumbersome for any age younger than junior high, I think. The only drawback is the lack of phonetic spelling - I think we expect it from a dictionary, but most picture dictionaries leave that part out for some reason.This is not a good book for young children - too many things to look at on one page...EXCELLENT resource for adults and teens, though, who are eager to increase vocabulary and are confident with pronunciation. I use it a lot in my Spanish classes, and even as a reference, when wanting to boost the vocabulary list for the week.For the younger child learning Spanish, try Flip Flop Spanish, which comes with a CD. Or Al reves ingles - which will be out shortly."
4,Pretty Good,"I still like the original better, but the New Oxford Picture Dictionary is a good resource and is on my list of recommended visual dictionaries."
3,a little expensive,i think it will be very thick before but it's notalthough it's used but still expensivebut content are helpful
3,Book needs to be streamlined,"Content of book is good. The author demystifies the technical aspects of Illustrator fairly well.But the book's organization is below par. The author is verbose at times, and some of his cliches tend to clutter the chapters. For future editions, the author needs to address the fundamental concepts more concisely. Extra visual aids would also prove helpful."
5,perfect,the delivery was fast easy to put together. it was exactly like the pisture. now the birds wont eat my tomatoes this yr. thanku again
2,Gardman R688 greenhouse,"This is a very flimsy greenhouse. I had no problem putting it together but is was easier with two people to put the cover on it. Our house is on pilings and the greenhouse is under the house, not out in the open. I anchored it with pipe clamps to a 2x6 fastened to the pilings and then put large concrete blocks on the bottom rails to keep them down. Also, I used large cable ties to secure the cover to the bottom rail. Since the connectors are just pushed together, time will tell if they can be blown loose. I cannot see how the supplied stakes and tie downs would work outside in a windy area. I was downsizing from a studier greenhouse that I could not relace the cover. The price is right on this one but I'm not sure how many years it will last."
1,Zippers breaking is a recurring problem with product,"We've owned our greenhouse for just over a month. The zipper has already broken and can not be fixed, basically rendering the greenhouse useless. I see from other reviews here that this is a common problem. The sad part is that you only pay $75.00 for the product and then the manufacturer wants to charge you $80.00 to replace the cover only, what a scam. Make a wise decision and invest a little more money and get yourself a quality product. You'll be satisfied in the long run."
1,Don't waste your money,Was so excited to get this and was easy to put together. Do not live in a windy area but put it next to the house and tied it to the fence for protection. First breeze broke all the connectors and rendered it useless. Never even got to use it.
2,Gardman r688 walk in Greenhouse,"When I received the gardman greenhouse, I was very excited. My husband assembled it with out an issue, however, when I was zipping the one side to close, the zipper broke so we used fishing line to enclose the one side. I should have sent it back but unfortunetly did not."
2,Wears out quickly,"All in all, the little greenhouse is ok...but the sun will destroy it in about a year. I had mine outside for less than 15 months before I had to take it down and throw it away. The sun eats up the plastic pretty fast for an outdoor item... If you only plan to use it for a short time, it's fine."
4,Works well,This was fairly easy to assemble. There are a lot of parts so make sure you keep the instructions. Once it was up it was very nice and durable.
2,Zippers don't last!,"This is a cute little greenhouse but it won't stand up to even mild winds and the zippers are very poor quality. The tabs broke very quickly and then the zippers separate when zipped. This makes it pretty useless in cold and windy weather, when you need it most!"
1,didnt hold up,"got 2 of these, 1 for my sister. both had very fragile plastic connectors which broke easily and had to be taped together. After 6 months, the plastic on both had completely dissolved into dust and the cover was shredded to pieces. Seemed like a good idea but didn't last . I have looked and havent found any warranty info so I guess I'm out of luck"
3,This is a great greenhouse.....but,"This greenhouse is perfect if you want one that is small and conveniently sized. I was so excited when I received it and it is fun and useful. The wind blew it away one time and the joints got twisted and useless, but the company sent me some new ones in just a few days. So when you construct yours, try to put it out of the wind. You wouldn't believe how cute it is.Update: Not only were the joints twisted and useless, but the support rods were also twisted. I e-mailed a few weeks ago, and have not received a reply. Only used it a few months and now I can't use it anymore."
1,Disappointed,First I was missing pieces so make you you count everything and from what I have read other people are missing pieces too. Set up is easy I did it myself in an hour or so. With in the first few days one of the zippers broke off on a weekend I was not home. The plastic tears very easy and i have several and have only owned it for a few weeks. It almost blew away during a storm and we had to buy more parts to secure it and I placed cinder block on the plastic inside because the little sticks they give you aren't worth a damn. It would be cheaper and better if you just made one from plastic and wood.
2,All good until the zipper broke,"Easy to put together, seemed to be well made, then one of the zippers started separating. I tried to get the zipper started again but the zipper fell apart in my hand. The day I put it together we had 26 degree weather so I had to sew the opening up as best I could since I had the greenhouse full of plants."
1,short-lived,"I do not recommend this item. It is a waste of money. I got 2 and put them in 2 different, sheltered places. Wind blew both structures down several times in 1 winter in an area not known for strong winds. It stayed connected to the ground. The structure bent and broke, the connector parts split. It didn't even last through 1 winter. I got new connector parts from the compant and the same thing happeded again. The second year, the plastic shredded. I do not recommend this item."
5,Excellent Little Greenhouse,"The Mockingbirds peck unprotected ripe tomatoes here and I've struggled for years with protection schemes. None of them worked. So, I determined to get an inexpensive greenhouse to thwart those pesky birds. There are many small greenhouses available but they can be pricey. Shipping can be expensive as well ($40 for a similar one this size on a different site. Yikes!) There is no way I was going to design and build a Mockingbird protector for $109 total. My Gardman was delivered FAST. Set-up was easy. I'm sure it will survive the season and then blow-away in our September hurricane. I'm happy!"
1,"Poor, cheap construction, won't last.","The assembly was quick and relatively easy. That's the only good thing about it.I had this greenhouse installed for just over a week, and then we had some 40-50mph winds. That kind of wind is not unusual in most places, and you will probably get something like that at least a few times a year.Well, the plastic joints broke, and now it is unusable. I guess I am going to build a wood frame for it.It would be cheaper to just build your own frame and buy some greenhouse plastic sheets and make your own greenhouse."
3,Why Mario Why??,"This book is divided into two parts(I think)These being the Romance part and the historical action partPart B was the part I liked it really got into the complex politics of the region(Italy of the 15th century). This includes rather confusing political marriages and city politics. The shear decadence of the Borga family was amazing and this book does a very good job of covering all of that. There are also some really good battle sceans to keep the reader interestedPart A in a word ""sucks"" yes I know that the ""Union"" between Cathera and Luchrathia actually happened but why can't we just say something like ""And so they had sex""? No that would be too easy, instead they have to go into gory detail.Overall-I love Puzo but at times this one reads more like Ann Rice or some cheesy romance novel then Puzo. Also past reviewers are correct, this book has an air of not being finished, like they had to rush this for to the publisher or something."
3,Mildly interesting,"After seeing how badly written _The Godfather_ was, I didn't thonk I'd ever pick up another Puso book. I got this for a dollar and I guess it was worth the money. The writing is o.k. and the story is mildly interesting. Ambition and vanity lead to a downfall. Kind of a sad story of greed and dysfunction. The characters are pretty shallow. The setting is kind of interesting although Puzo drops in people lile DaVinci and Machievelli as throw-away characters. Still, it was interesting enough to keep me reading to the end.Not bad but not recommended."
4,Exciting to read,"I really enjoyed reading this book. From the very beginning there is scandel and intrigue in the Chatholic church. It is one of the few books that I did not give up on somewhere in the middle. I liked the way the story unfolded, never giving away too much information at any point. When I finished this book I immediately wanted to find out more about the Borgia family."
2,All I dislike about modern popular literature in one place,"I've never written a book review before, but this was more than I could bear. I was looking for historical ""fictional non-fiction"" and found the silliest book I've read in some time. The only thing I can really remember about the book that stands out (I finished it last week) is that 3/4 of the way through I laughingly thought that the only thing they missed was homosexuality, but they didn't disappoint and a silly, pointless, passing reference was crammed in. I haven't read Mario Puzo before (but of course loved the movie The Godfather) but I'll bet this is not on the same level as his other novels. If they turn this one into a movie, it'll be on USA starring Lorenzo Lamas as the pope and Bjork as Lucretia Borgia."
2,"A Good Story, Poorly Told","It would be very difficult to make the story of the family Borgia dull, but Mario Puzo and Carol Gino do their best. Pope Alexander VI, nee Rodrigo Borgia, manipulated his and his illegitimate brood's way to the top of the European food chain using whatever means necessary, and their rise to power makes for interesting reading. However, Mr. Puzo, and Ms. Gino tell the story in a style that never seems to fit history, historical fiction, or romance, and so becomes a hodge-podge of what may be the worst of all three. The history is incomplete, the fiction is plodding, and the romance is overblown. I finished the book because I love Vatican skullduggery, and it served as airplane and hotel reading, but as much as I'd recommend someone read about the Borgia's, I'd never recommend anyone do it with this book."
2,Great Potential but Fell Flat,"This novel had great potential but if fell flat for the characters were not richly developed and dialogue seemed flat. The historical era could have lent itself to so many fascinating stories, but instead we got wars and alliances, in a chronilogical series, with little enrichment. A few famous characters were integrated into the plot, but I don't know why for they were never well developed into the story. We know no more about them now then did before reading this novel. I never felt as if I was there in the story and I never really felt for the characters. It was a slow read and the end was so sadly predicable, all loose ends tied up neatly. I adore Mario Puzo's work, but this was weak."
1,A disappointment of historical proportions.,"What a profound & shocking disappointment this attempt at historical fiction has turned out to be for me. I can but hope that the blame falls on the inept hand of editors & an incompetant co-author. Tragically, Mario Puzo's last book is also his most flawed & forgetable.A choppy & inelegent style; flat & underdeveloped characters; descriptions of settings that are less interesting than the back of your average box of breakfast cereal.And perhaps worst of all...historical inaccuracies -- especially glaring & obvious in a supposed work of historical fiction."
3,A Family Tragedy,"Tells the story of quite an unconventional family - the Pope's and all the sacrifices each member has to go through to do the ""will of God"" (Warning: You may be appalled upon reading what these sacrifices really are, one wonders how these events were allowed to happen in the Holy See). As with most Puzo novels, it has the puppeteer (Rodrigo Borgia aka Pope Alexander) that holds all the strings.I give this book 4 stars because I can sense a deviation in writing style at the end owed to the fact that Carol Gino concluded this novel as requested by the dying Mario Puzo."
2,Boring Borgias!,"If you're interested in the ultimate fates of the Borgia pope and his four children (e.g., how did Cesare meet his end?), this book might be a good read on three or four pages. But if your are interested in absolute historical accuracy, go somewhere else. Puzo takes one of the most notoriously rapacious killer families in medieval Italy and turns them into a ""sure they did some bad things, but they had reasons of the hearts to do them"" people...not even one mention of Lucrezia Borgia poisoning someone...I mean, Hello!"
4,Good reading!,"This is another good book from Mario Puzo aptly finished by Carol Gino! I was not familiar with the Borgias at all prior to reading this book which is probably an advantage. It may be a disappointment if you come with that historical knowledge. The story is fast-paced, the characters well depicted (quite similar to the Corleones in more ways than one though). A bit too many graphic sexual themes at times, overshadows the point of the chapter! Good read though and a nice change in era :)"
2,Not Typical Puzo,"I have to say I rather like Puzo's books ""the Fourth K"", ""The Sicilian"" and ""Omerta"". I thought this would really be the crown of his career ... we're talking about the Borgia's here. To my dismay this book just doesn't cut it. Dare I say it's pretty boring! Very slow and quite repetitive in the acts in the book this is quite lackluster. Do yourself a favor wait for the paperback if you must."
2,Not his best book.,"Not his best book, because Puzo violates the first rule of writing, ""Show it; don't say it."" This makes it impossible to maintain tension or character development. You are told Lucretia repents, but never see it. This book, is more a popularization of history rather than a novel. It reads like ""Everyman,"" a morality play where characters lack depth and walk through their lines. It's episodic: no drama, no melodrama. He's a great novelist, when he writes about what he knows; but here, he's writing about what he doesn't know, and it shows."
3,Entertaining History,"I randomly read this book not know anything about it - not know that it is surprisingly historically accurate in its account and lurid description of Pope Alexander VI's rise and fall. The book is mainly a history with bits of dialogue recreated by the author. In terms of being ""historical fiction"", I think it leans more on the history than the fiction.The lives of the Borgias family certainly lends well to the idea that history can be an entertaining endeavor.The downside is that the book really does try to cover too much information and at many times you forget that you're not in history class anymore."
1,Terrible and disgusting!!!,"This book was so disgusting I couldn't even finish it! What got me particularly got me was Lucrezia and Cesare's incestuous relationship that I found so terible. What was Puzo thinking when he wrote this piece of garbage! I found none of the characters the least bit likable or sympathetic, unlike the characters in The Godfather & Omerta. When the book mentioned that thet were trying to protect themselves from invasion, I couldn't help but wish they would get overrun by invaders. Terrible characters, terrible, context, in fact I wish I could've given it ZERO stars!!"
2,Not Puzo's Best,"This was not Puzo's best work, that much is for sure. Found myself flipping through pages as the plot droned on and on and on. The incest was disturbing, to say the least. I just really did not enjoy much of this book. Some of his other books are worthy of re-reading over and over again, but this one will remain on the bookshelf for a very long time...at least until I trade it in to the used book store."
3,Mafia or Catholic Church -- the greater criminal?,"If I were not already aware of the sins of the church, I would be shocked to find that there was murder, sex, and political intrigue behind the red robes. But like the police imspector in Casablanca, I am well aware of what is going on and Puzo tells a great story of a powerful Italian family and their role in this church. Worth more than one read."
2,A BIG DISSAPOINTMENT,"MR PUZO WHAT IS THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.R U THE SAME 1 WHO GAVE US "" THE GODFATHER,""THE LAST DON""."
3,Not Puzo's finest,"The book was recommended to me by a friend who had seen the BBC series, ""The Borgias"". So I gave it a try, and was not too impressed with the writing. I will give Puzo the benefit of the doubt... after he died it was finished by a co-author and published posthumously."
5,The Family,"This is the second time I have purchased this book. Every time I lend it to a friend, I end-up having to buy another copy. My friends have borrowed this book from me, and it has traveled half-way around the world! It is a very good and interesting read. It is based on a true story, and I like Mario Puzo's writing style. The Borgia's, which is the family this book is based on, have a corrupt climb up the ladder towards success. Now, there is also the Borgia DVD edition. Like most movies, not all details can be portrait. I highly recommend this book. It is one that you will have a hard time putting down, until you have finished reading it! Enjoy!!!!"
3,Hints of Puzo,"""The Family"" was an okay read. The subject and it's historical characters hold your attention well, but I can't say I finished it with a feeling of triumphant accomplishment. When I read Mario Puzo's ""The Godfather,"" I'd written down enough quotes from it to fill a small diary. In this book I can count the memorable quotes on half a hand. Don't make the mistake I did of comparing other Puzo works with this.I'm sure others have questioned the input Puzo had on this book. The hints of Puzo were there in it's theme of family and power, but I felt it tried too hard to be Puzo.I did enjoy the story of the Borgia family with all their dysfunctionality.""""If you love nothing, then power is an aberration, and more important still a threat. For power is dangerous and can turn at any moment."""
3,The Renaissance - A Time of Turmoil,"Incest, debauchery,intrigue, and dublicity! It is all here in one delightful romp through the early Renaissance. In my school days Pope Alexander VI stood out in my textbook as the one who arbitrated the Line of Demarcation in the New World between Spanish and Portuguese claims. Puzo graphically shows why nothing else was mentioned about this Pope in our school texts as he leaves no doubt that Alexander VI was a definite bad boy of the times both comparatively and absolutely. This is not great literature but unequivocially a delightful gambol through the lives of some of the most powerful figures in the world at the end of the Fourteenth Century."
3,Very Good,"I really enjoyed reading ""The Family"". Some things in the book are pretty shocking, such as the sexual deviencies practiced by Pope's children and Pope himself. The story is very involving and historically accurate (to the best of my knowledge. Carol Gino diod an excellent job in finishing the work and one can't feel a differnce in her writting from Puzo's. If you like Mario's previous works this book is certainly something you don't want to miss."
3,Interesting,"This book was an OK read. The writing was stiff, but the story was interesting, if somewhat historically inaccurate. It was good bedtime reading and maybe something I would take with me on a vacation when I want to read something but I don't want to think about it too hard. Lots of gore and weird sex and who doesn't enjoy that?However, if you want the real story, there are tons of well written, colourful and accurate biographies."
2,Dull book.,"Surprisingly dull attempt to re-create what ought to have been a compelling story. Far from author's best, which can beremarkably good. Apparently published after author's death. Would he have wanted this book to be published? Notnearly so impressive as The Godfather."
3,Factoid heaven (or hell),"This book has some interesting information-but the approach of the authors is too clinical. Information is presented rather lifelessly and anecdotes are related but with no real information-as in ""John quotes from such and such song by Bob Dylan to sarcastically answer George""--but we are never given the quotes. From the information contained-it is easy to see why George quit the group at one time--but it was Paul that it was reported that he refused to play with again after the actual breakup--while from all the information presented it should have been John that he wanted nothing to do with and would have written ""Wah Wah"" about. Ringo is pretty much a disinterested observer, while Paul tries to hold things together and John has actually become the ""Nowhere Man"" This book has an interesting premise-but the style of writing is tedious. I enjoyed parts of it--but it could have been so much better."
5,Superb song-by-song(more than a hundred) documentary of film,"Covers all sessions of January-1969 Let it Be album and flm sessions. Goes over song by song the good, the bad and the ugly of these sessions. It documents how badly the rehearsals were. The arguements are detailed, their future plans are revealed, and ultimately...predicts the break-up of the Beatles. Sometimes can get tedious but if you stay with this you get the most accurate picture available of this time period. A cool book for Beatles fans. PG"
2,Informative but not very well written,"This book was informative but written son that you couldn't really read it like you would any normal book. You read basically little paragraphs about it. All in all, it's not really very good."
4,Valuable for researchers,"Another author once said that ""an account of the Beatles' 'Get Back' sessions could fill a book - a boring book, but a book nonetheless."" What makes this book important for Beatles research is that it does seem to cover every available bit of audio from that time, filling in the gaps left by Mark Lewisohn's superb books, and putting them in an all-important chronological order, so that those who own ""Get Back"" bootlegs can use this as reference to put what they are hearing in context. Indeed, reading is no substitute for hearing the tapes oneself, but one must know what the heck one is hearing, and know that it has not been altered or spliced."
2,"About the Beatles' ""Let it Be"" Sessons","This book is good for reference and events, but it is not the kind of book that I would want to read. It was very boring and it just went on and on about what they did and every move they made and every word they said (just about). And every song that they sung. I could have probably gotten this information from the movie ""Let it Be"" But I've never seen the movie. I don't think I would recomend this to any one who likes to read alot."
4,The Beginning Of The End,"The Get Back sessions that were filmed and eventually surfaced as the Let It Be movie and soundtrack are often marked as the beginning of the end of the Beatles. Although they had arguments and outbursts (Ringo actually quit during the White Album sessions) before, this project brought all of their ill feelings to a head. Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighart extensively detail practically every minute of the project. We get some of the ideas the band were floating around at the time with the possible return to the concert stage being the most interesting. The one problem with the book is that it is unauthorized and you don't get any real first hand recollections from the major players. That aside, you can tell that the two authors are devout fans and their enthusiasm shines through the darkest period of the band."
3,"Perhaps, not for the casual listener...","This recording of Mozart's Marriage of Figaro has strengths and weaknesses. The recoding is accompanied by the complete libretto, artist profiles, essays, and rich historical information. But be aware that the recording technology in 1937 was somewhat limited, and listeners who are accustom to more modern recording technology may be distracted by these limits. The performance itself, is of course, outstanding.My 3 star rating here reflects the limits of the 1937 recording technology vs a more modern version, everything except this limitation is excellent."
5,Excellent discussion of Paul's thought and mission!,"I am neither a philosopher nor a theologian, merely an interested layman. I found this book to be incredibly insightful - both way beyond my rudimentary knowledge of the subject yet simultaneously easy enough to read and assimilate. I feel after reading this book that I at least have a real appreciation of Paul's significance to the church - especially the early church - and what the main issues of his preaching were, and, to an extent, how and why his epistles to different peoples (Corinthians, Romans, Galatians, etc) dealt with different topics in different ways. Much, much more than a ""life of St Paul"", this book will help illuminate for you how the church developed the way it did, and how Paul contributed to that development."
2,Would not recommend for Powermatic 64,"Pros:Sturdy base, solid construction.Cons:Item arrived without any assembly instructions. Was able to find a manual online for a similar base online which helped with assembly. After assembly it was clear that it did not fit the Powermatic 64A as indicated, so had to return it.Front locking foot (separate from the caster) seems like an afterthought in how it bolts on. Could be integrated into the caster for a better design."
1,No brake on swivel wheel,"I bought a very similar base from this company. Note that there is no brake on the swivel wheel. If you don't mind your surface planer swiveling around while you try to use it, go ahead and get this base."
3,"They do their job, however...","The ribs don't go far enough up the condom for my preference, and the condoms have this sickly sweet fruity smell. They function in the manner a condom should, but there are better ones out there."
5,These are great!,"These are excellent because they smell somewhat like blueberries or fruit punch, have a more flesh-like (pinkish) color, and are ribbed at the bottom. The price is amazing for a 12-pack, and they work great!"
3,Not bad...,This is a fairly simple system to use but takes some practice to get things right. The 1/4 inch bits that are compatible with the 2200 are #2243 and #2233 - not #1633 and #1643 which are combined w/ the 2200 on Amazon - according to the directions. Amazon apparently doesn't sell the proper bits for smaller dovetails for the 2200 system. I bot the 1643 and 1633 bits only to discover the bearing is significantly smaller than the larger bits rendering them useless with this system. They are on their way back to Amazon.
3,Advertising,"""handles wood 1/8- to 3/4-inch thick"". To do this you need to purchase additional router bits."
1,Dont Buy It!,"Bought this unit 12 months ago after my original badger 5 gave up the ghost. While installation was easy, unfortunately the unit didnt make it to its first birthday before it started leaking due to a cracked housing. We've never put bones down the disposal, egg shells and canteloupe rinds are about as tough as it got for the badger 7 but that proved too much for the housing to take before it cracked in 2 places. Luckily we had the warranty......wrong! since i cant find my original receipt (my fault) the company wont honor the warranty. that is in despite of the fact we registered the warranty when we purchased the product. Apparently per customer service that is only for marketing purposes. My advise, buy a Waste King, #1 rated by consumer reports."
1,Unreliable - Avoid this Disposal,"Purchased it assuming that going to 3/4 hp would mean a more durable unit. Wrong. Assumed the ""In-sink-erator"" brand would mean quality. Wrong. It lasted exactly 2 months before the day when I flipped the switch and the unit just sits there and hums. Blades are not jammed and can be spun freely with my hand, there was no incident with anything jamming it up or clunking around in there-- the thing just ceased to work... so it feels like something in the unit just failed. I've read some reviews that tapping on the motor housing may fix the issue, but is this really what I want to expect from an appliance? Going to buy a different unit, different brand and swap it out this weekend and never ever touch this brand again.Willing to bet if I look on the underside it will say ""Hecho en Chine"". There is a price we pay for ""cheap"", folks, wise up and start buying more American."
1,cracked housing on 2 units within 3 weeks of each other,"We replaced two old disposal units in our kitchen at the same time a year ago, getting rid of the units that were here when we bought the house 11 years ago, after one of the old units failed. About 3 - 4 weeks ago, one of the new units developed a crack in the housing, and had to be replaced (fortunately it was under warranty). Now, less than a month later, the other new unit developed cracks in the same location of the housing - obviously a design or manufacturing defect, for both to fail the exact same way within the exact same time frame. Stay away from this make and model - I thought Insinkerator was good, but I was obviously wrong. So sorry I chose this brand - will never make this mistake again. So tired of cleaning up the disgusting leaking messes from under the kitchen sink this month!"
5,Best disposal on the market!!,"Years ago my daughter bought me an InSinkErator disposal. It gave me no problems and lasted for many years. Then I called a company and w/o asking they installed a Whirlpool disposal. Whirlpool is a good brand but they aren't nearly as good as the InSinkErator in the disposal department. My present plumber thinks InSinkErator is the best. He recommended one with at least 5 1/2 HP. The InSinkErator I bought is a 5XP 3/4 HP disposal. In my opinion, nothing compares with InSinkErator.M.G.TX"
2,Badger 5 XP doesnt last,"I am disappointed with the durability of this disposer. Like many others, I thought I was buying the best with Insinkerator but I was wrong. After 3 years of putting up with the humming and the resets with nothing blocking the unit from turning, I'm giving up. I thought I could get a little more time out of this unit but when I looked inside with a flashlight and saw all the corrosion and rotted away metal, I know it's time to toss it. Waste King here I come!"
1,terrible.,"Same issue as a few reviewers here. After a few months of VERY light use, one day i flipped the switch and it did nothing but hum. No jam. Just didnt work. Do not buy."
1,Defective unit,"The InSink Erator Badger I purchased last April was shipped to me here in the Philippines this month. I was having it installed when I first noticed there was no power cord. Fortunately I still had the old Badger and was able to use the cord. After installation, the new Badger did not work! It just produced a stuck-up sound. Now I have to suffer the consequence of buying overseas. The seller (Grady's Ace Hardware) should have inspected the item before delivery."
5,Great,"It arrived on time, and very easy to install. But it did cause me a little problems since it was larger than the one I was replacing. I didn't let that stop me, after sometime, it snapped into place, and I was home free, happy I bought a larger size."
2,Another leaker!,"Defective design causes it to rust and start leaking out of the bottom near the reset button. Only has a three year warranty and that's about as long as you can expect it to last. Upgraded to the ""XP"" thinking I would get more usage than the old Badger I replaced, but I was sorely disappointed. Noticed the Big Box Home Improvement store where I purchased it no longer carries this model.I'm giving up on the Badger and looking for something more reliable."
3,Decision Points :),"The movie as a whole wasn't bad. It was suppose to be a suspenseful disaster flick and it was. And While the minor characters were guilty of overacting, Meredith Baxter was refreshingly believable as the President.I had no idea she was that talented .Scott Valentine was quite good too, as was his co-pilot once the early dialogue was over. The special effects were truly lousy though. The worst being the last scene, but none were believable in this fx age. The high point, however, being Meredith Baxter as President. I wish it had been a ""headier"" movie for that character."
4,Watch It and Enjoy It.....good but no masterpiece,"I enjoyed this movie. In fact I bought it. It does exactly what it sets out to do, which is build suspense and entertain. The acting and script are good, but not fantastic. It has two actors from Family Ties, Meredith Baxter and Scott Valentine (Elise Keaton and Nick, her daughter Mallory's boyfriend) who are brother and sister in the film. This alone would make it worth watching, but in accordance with present day revelations, Meredith Baxter is our female lesbian president with a first lady and children--if only America were that open-minded, right? Gotta love it...just watch and enjoy this, it ain't supposed to be Citizen Kane."
2,Not Good,"Is this film worth your time?No, not really.Is this film worth buying?If you can get it cheap. VERY cheap.How is the acting?Not very good at all. It is barely passable.How is the character development?There is virtually none. I didn't care whether or not the characters died or lived with the exception of the Air Force Pilots.How are the special effects?They are not good either.How does this film stack up against other Ayslum films?Well it is your typical Asylum film. I would say it is better than some but worse than some others.Overall, if you can get it for 3 bucks or less I would say take a chance and see it. Just watch it with an open mind. I'm not going to give it one star because I knew what I was buying. Just be warned, this is not a great film by any means. If you want a good hijacker movie go see Delta Force with Chuck Norris."
4,Love it,"My favorite peice of camping equipment. Everyone that walked by our site was interested in it. For the most part it was built very well, except for the legs. Legs were very week and wobbely, which it weird, because the rest of it was very sturdy. After our 1st trip, we reinforsed the legs by putting PVC piping over them. After that I had no complaints."
1,Not Sturdy,The legs that attach to the sink section have are plastic screw type and made the sink very wobbly. The extended shelf section was not sturdy enough then to hold a stove or grill and actually pulled on the plastic sink and made an impression. The water system worked however cannot be used with solid water jugs as seen in other photos. The connections for the water system were push on not screw on and were hard to connect. This was not a typical GSI product. Not a good design. I called GSI as well and gave them this review. I purchased this from another store and they are refunding me.
5,Also strident manufacturing standers.,"I worked as a Sex re-educator for persons newly diagnosed with HIV prior to retirement... These condoms are Made to Japanese standards which require a much smaller pore size and a 0% failure rate. US standards allow for a higher failure rate and larger pore sizes that, while too small for sperm to get through, are not too small for HIV to get through.They are also more pleasurable to wear and produce a more natural feel than most other brands.Draw back: They stretch so once on they are comfy. However they tend to be a bit smaller making application trickier... on the other hand they stay put better..."
2,they rip.......!!!,i bought these condoms and i used them with my boyfriend and for some reason they rip.......that happend more then once...even though i used lubricant...
4,"Great plot, but constantly-angry characters","I liked this book at first, but found myself getting annoyed with the fact that the only way these characters seem to interact is in anger. Manda Scott's characters are almost as depressing and as nasty to each other as Patricia Cornwell's. I really wish someone would come up with a pair of lesbians who don't act as if they hate each other all the time!In general, even though I liked the book, I found it hard to believe the motivation for most things that her characters do. And they are constantly flying at each other over the slightest thing. No one I know acts this way. Thank god!"
5,"tightly-plotted, well-written and engaging","Originally, I picked up ""Night Mares"" simply because I love horses and literature to do with them in any capacity, which is one of the reasons why Dick Francis hardly ever dulled on me. But this is a good novel in its own right, tightly plotted, well-written and with engaging characters.A brilliant young veterenary surgeon runs into difficulties with an MRSA-like bug affecting horses in her surgery. Old stresses and traumas rise back to the surface as her sanity and composure beging to unravel. Her friend and therapist who serves as the narrator is not without issues of her own and the tension betwen the two carries the story well."
5,(4 1/2 stars) Don't miss this book,"In ""Night Mares"", we find again Kellen Stewart, the psychiatrist introduced in Manda Scott's excellent debut novel ""Hen's Teeth"", unwittingly involved in a mystery. Just like in ""Hen's Teeth"", Manda Scott is able to portray complex characters, in Kellen, Nina and Steff, and to introduce us to interesting secondary characters such as Sandy or Eric. The mystery plot is skillfully woven and the science details are quite accurate. However, the main strength of ""Night Mares"" is Scott's detailed writing and ability to deftly create a heavy, almost nightmarish, atmosphere, turning this mystery almost into a thriller. The quality of Manda Scott's writing is quite impressive, and she is without doubt among the best writers of lesbian fiction."
2,Disappointed in character's development,"After reading and enjoying ""Hen's Teeth"" I tried this one. I was unhappy with the ethical boundaries of the main character. I realized that I lost respect for her due to her unprofessional behavior. I will read the next one, but was disappointed to find that I can't recommend this one to my friends."
5,Great lens!,"Terrific lens ~ well balanced. While photos are dependent on the photographer, this was a much appreciated tool for my husband's camera bag & the included case was well made too."
4,Good for the Price,"A pretty good lens if your budget is kind of low or you are a beginner. Good focal length and decent aperture minimum and maximum. Sigma is definitely a good brand for beginners or people who have a low to mid-ranged budget. The only thing bad is the heaviness/bulkiness of the lens and the AutoFocus is louder than most. (Hint hint, the word ""motorized"")"
4,Awesome lens for the price and size.,This is a very light weight alternative to some other much more expensive zooms. Although it may not out perform the more expensive lenses it does hold its own quite well. It produced some stunning images for me--that quite frankly I did not think it could do for the price I paid.Overall it is a great lens and even better at the $140 price I paid. I would pay $200 for this lens as well as it is listed on most sights.It should be noted that my copy of the lens had a Macro Button that was tricky to switch on an off. I will probably use it less for macro but the function is not always needed to get good close ups of bugs and flowers.
5,Sigma 70-300 f/4-5.6 DG APO Macro Telephoto Zoom Lens,Great lens. I love the fact that you can still take close up shots without the blackout that usually occurs when you put a lens that doesn't start at a low distance setting. I love Sony cameras and thought that this lens may not work well with my Sony DSLR but boy was I wrong. This lens has so many features it's unbelievable. The images that were captured with this lens are so amazing and perfect. The features are very easy to understand and I love the fact that you can change from manual to automatic focusing.
4,Great lens for half the price!,"I was looking for a newer, replacement lens for my Canon digital SLR, and stumbled across this gem. Half the price of the equivalent Canon brand lenses, it immedaitely caught my attention. Once I satisfied myself that it would indeed be compatible with my camera, I bought it and tried it out. Not only did it work, it was easier to use than the lens I had bought it to replace! I highly recommend this lens to any Canon owner looking for a telephoto lens, whether they have a digital or print camera."
2,"Go for the Canon. This is cheap, cheap, cheap.","Based on the reviews here at Amazon I bought this lens. Within 5 minutes after it arrived it was out of the box and I was shooting, but I was extremely disappointed. It looks cheap and feels cheap. The zoom operation is stodgy and for the life of me I had a hard time getting nicely focused, hand-held pictures. I knew every time I used this lens I'd end up hating it, so I wrapped it back up and ordered the Canon. That arrived last night and there is absolutely no comparison. The IS USM version costs a little over $500, but it's worth it in my book."
1,CRAP.,"Seriously. Right out of the box I was impressed. It came with a lens hood, bag for the lens and it really made you feel like you bought quality. I attached it to my camera and right away I noticed vignette, back focusing, noisy focusing and over saturation. I could have gotten a bad copy but, it was enough to make me send it back that day. This is my personal experience. I'm not saying all SIGMA 70-300s act this way."
3,focus questionable,"My reservations about this lens is that the focus seems soft even with a steady tripod. And because it does not have image stabilization (VC in Sigma speak), it is almost useless when used free hand. I am having a hard time getting a good picture with a monopod at the long end of the zoom, so unless you can use a tripod at all times, this lens is not a good choice. If I was to make this purchase again, I would look for a Canon IS lens with similar range."
3,Design flaw wih macro/non-macro switch? Otherwise lens is great value!,"I have marked this only three stars following my panic when I tried the macro setting for the first time--and it stuck. It would not switch out of macro mode. It felt like the switch would break. And I was outside of the 30-day Amazon return window.After some online research, this is what I found out:- you can only switch Macro on at focal lengths between 200-300 (and then you can't go lower than 200 using the zoom)- you have to play with setting focus MANUALLY, on the lens, before it will allow you to switch Macro off.It feels like you're breaking the lens. I like to be gentle with lenses. I may never use the macro setting again.As a lower-price, regular 70-300 zoom, it does an excellent job."
4,Owner/user for 7 years - non-professional (duh!),"Attached to a Nikon D70 - purchased with a Nikon N80 in December 2001 for use at the 2002 Winter Olympics in SLC. I had it on the D70 at John Mayer ([...]) and it peformed in a way that was as enjoyable as the show.I wish is opened at to f1.8 - but you can purchase 10 of these lens for the price of 1 f1.8. It's a matter of getting used to knowing when to shoot fast with low light and correct with your photo software - pretty easy to add lighting - or shoot numbers on - and hope that there isn't much movement or you get the blurs.It's been packed throughout Southern Utah's redrock country, numerous sporting events - and it's an outstanding value for outdoor shooting with adequate light. If you link to the flickr site you'll see some pretty good detail on John Mayer's tatoos - shot in the dark - about fifty rows up. You'll not get image stabilization, or HSM, but you'll get zoom results once you get used to this lens!"
4,Not bad...,"I would say this lens is ""not bad"" for the money. It's certainly no professional lens but it's worth what you pay for it.I purchased this lens for my Canon XD. It works fairly well on the camera. It's a little slow focusing. Indoors it focuses poorly in moderately low light. Photos taken outdoors with this lens are fairly sharp all the way out to 300mm.I really regret buying this lens. It's practically useless indoors at 70mm on the Canon XD since that equates to over 100mm with the XD. I wish I had purchased an 18mm to 300mm lens. They cost a little more but are certainly more versitile.The macro mode works OK with a tripod. I really can get better close-ups with my 50mm prime lens."
1,trip ruined,"I bought this lens several months before a family trip to Alaska know I would want to shoot some wildlife there. The lens worked fine for the first few months I had it, but low and behold, it crapped out in the middle of a 6 hour wildlife tour, leaving me with a load of lousy photos and ample frustration. A family member ended up getting much better pictures using a $150 point and shoot. I've since emailed the company 3 times never to receive so much as even a reply, much less any assistance.I know you get what you pay for, but a company should at least stand behind it's products."
4,Good Telephoto Zoom Lens,"I've been using this lens for a week now on my Canon 40D. I have not travelled with it as yet, but the results thus far are pleasing. I made the decision to buy it based on budget constraints, and the reviews on this site, as well as Fred Miranda and others.The IQ and color balance are good, sharpness is surprisingly good for a lens of this price range. The build quality is solid. Had a small problem with enabling and disabling the macro lock (200-300mm ONLY)at first, but now am used to it and have had no further issues.As with any lens of this length, hand holding it and getting a sharp photo at the far end is a challenge. Better to use a tripod. Otherwise, I recommend this lens for us amateurs, and anyone who wants the reach but has a budget constraint."
4,good one,"This is better than I imagined before. Really sharp and focus well at low light. The only unhappy thing is the mechanic sounds and its shape. But as many users feeling, this lense is good one for a beginner."
2,"Works, but only in daylight.","This lens works with a tripod and clear daylight. If that's what you are interested in, you should go for it.The shots of the moon, I took turned out to be disappointing. I did use a tripod, but it doesn't seem to work very well at night."
5,Great lens for the price,"I bought this lens for the Rebel XT. After looking at a few macro lenses, I finally decided to purchase this one, since it was cheaper and according to the reviews had pretty good quality.So far I don't have any complaints. It works very well for my needs. I use it pretty much all the time in macro mode for nature photography.I use it during the day, with a lot of light, so images come out pretty sharp without a tripod (I uploaded one into the gallery).Some things to note are:1. This is my first SLR camera, thus the lens is unusually large and heavy, it does not bother me, since it is also very solid and well build.2. It takes some time to focus when the starting positoin is far off (it does have a long focus range). But once in the approximate focusing range it is pretty quick. Not a problem with continuous autofocus when shooting moving objects.Overall, it is a pretty good lens for the type of photographs that I use it for."
5,A Really Great Deal,This lens was cheap compared to it's Canon counterparts and I'm really plesad with the photos.The Macro feature is very good as well.I hand-hold for almost all my shots and I haven't really missed image stabilisation.
2,Sigma 70-300 Motorized Zoom lens for Nikon DSLR,"I wanted to upgrade to a longer zoom from my Nikkor 55-200mm lens, and it sounded like this was going to be a great substitute for the Nikkor 70-300 zoom lens which is way more expensive. Out of the box it looks and feels great, and the magnification is excellent. However, I hadn't realised how much difference the VR - vibration reduction - on the Nikon makes. I take a lot of handheld sports and landscape shots. The sigma lens produced photos that just weren't clear enough for me. There was a lot of blurring, presumably from camera shake. This was unacceptable so I had to return it. I'll just have to spend the extra $$$ on the Nikkor with VR."
4,Great!,"Well, it's no Nikon 70-300 (slight optical difference...only slight), and it has no image stabilization (VR) but it's a great lens, and I use it mostly for 1:2 magnification. I had the older version of this lens, and just like that one, I enjoy this one as well. For the price, it is worth buying."
4,good for the money,"This is a good lens for the money. It's not fair to compare it to $600.00+ lenses, but it works well for the money. As has been stated before, it performs best in open daylight or well lit conditions, especially at it's max range of zoom. The macro feature is nice and I have used it more than the telephoto with some nice results."
4,Wonderful,"I suppose it depends on how much you'd use the lens. I, personally, use it at least one picture a day. My mentor, though, uses his about once a month. And my associate uses his for at least (on average) three hours a day - he's a photographer at a lot of sporting (action sports, as well as football, hockey, and wrestling) events.I love the lens. I wish it cost less, much like all of my photography equipment, but it is what it is. I'm outside a lot, so I make use of my filters. I am not as much of a nature photographer as I could be, but it's definitely my choice when I go on certain photowalks and such. A good macro telephoto to round-out your pack of lenses."
3,It's OK,"This lens is ok for the price. It has a nice zoom, but the autofocus is kind of squirley. It's loud adn it never seems to want to stop focusing. It really doesn't compare to any of the canon lenses that I own. The ""MACRO"" feature is not really macro at all. It basically allows you to focus on a subject slightly closer than you could without the macro switch. If you are looking for a lens to do macro photography I would suggest saving your money until you can buy one that does it at 1:1 - I do feel like this is a good alternative to a costly zoom lens for someone who would like to have one in their bag, but doesn't spend majority of their time at 300mm."
4,Nothing beats a Sigma 70-300APO for the price.,"The Sigma 70-300mm APO is a solid lense that is great for Zoo Trips and Macro Photography. It does a fair job in moderate light and has difficulty focusing in low light situations but what lense does?! Looses one star for a noisey focus motor but if your looking for a great Outdoors Lense, look no further and buy this lense!"
2,No bargain!,"Well built, quick to focus, quiet but not quite what I expected. At full zoom, picture is washed out. With MACRO pictures, center of picture is out of focus while periphery is in focus."
4,Great inexpensive zoom telephoto lens,"While this lens is not a pro lens by any means it does absolutely what you will need it to do in a variety of photographic situations and settings. No hand held telephoto lens will ever give you crisp clear shots (a chief complaint made in other reviews of this lens), but a serious photographer using a telephoto lens knows it has to be stabilized with a tripod or monopod to prevent camera shake and fuzzy pictures. For a $200 lens in the 70-300mm range this lens beats its Canon name brand equivalent with ease. Construction of this lens is better than the Canon and the Macro feature is something that the Canon lens lacks. I've used this lens in a variety of situations - sports photography, portrait photography, and landscape/nature photography - and it's never disappointed me. Another thing that impresses me with Sigma is that they include a lens hood and lens case with every lens they sell - Canon won't do that!"
4,"Very, very good with an affordable pricetag","I bought this lens when I was clueless about what I should be looking for for my Canon Xti. I basically just knew I wanted something with this much range. I was pleasantly suprised at the results this lens gets, however, and while I've upgraded some Canon lenses that I started with, I'm keeping this Sigma. It gives great results and I have no gripes whatsoever. I also own the Canon 28-105 which was my upgrade from a kit lens, and even though that lens is more expensive, this one has a lot better image quality. Also, as mentioned by others, this ships with a lens hood and a nice case, accessories that Canon makes you buy separately and at a premium.The macro feature is also really nice to have. Highly recommended!"
5,Sigma Photos,"Sigma PhotosAfter some 60 years as a keen non professional photographer, few years ago, I purchased a Sigma DP1 camera with the Foveon ship, then a DP2, Then a SD15 and last year a SD15 with a 18-200 lens, to which, I recently purchased a Sigma 70-300 F4-5.6 DG APO Macro lens , What an amazing lens for such cheap price.After few test shot at standard and macro setting, I set up fpr Moon photograph , and I have now , after much cropping, some beautifully detailed moon shot blow to A2 size. As a returning customer of Amazon.com , I was confident that the product ordered would be in perfect state, I was not disappointed."
1,Waste of money,"I have never been more disappointed and frustrated with a piece of equipment before. I can honestly say I hate this lens. Maybe when I was first starting out it was okay but now that I want more and demand more out of my camera this isn't cutting it.Most of all, the focus is utterly terrible. Not only is the automatic focus s l o o o o w....... But it doesn't matter if I'm shooting at 70mm, 300mm, or if my shutter speed is 1/1000 I can NEVER get a tack sharp photo from this lens. Apart from this, the color this lens produces is muddy and dull and not easy to correct in post processing because when you try, the photos just look fake. My opinion.I guess I learned the hard way. Next time I will save my money and spend it on a trusted brand name."
4,Sigma's great buy for the price,I was in need of a more powerful lense to compliment my 28-90mm lense when I found this. Though it was realitively inexspensive it surprised me in it's clarity /sharpness. Yes there is a bit of a halo at 300mm but not that bad. The auto focus isn't that great but is just ok. I use manual focus most the time anyway. All in all it is very good for most work and you can't beat the price. It is heavy enough to require a monopod for steadiness to aquire the sharpest shot. Good purchase if on a limited budget like myself.
4,Would get 5 stars if not for some autofocus problems,"A great macro lens for the money. Without a tripod, you'll have issues in the macro range if there isn't a strong light, but then if you were super serious about macro, you'd be using a tripod anyway.I've noticed some autofocus problems with this lens when trying to shoot stuff that is farther away. Even if you make the subject rather large in the viewfinder, often I find myself still having to use the manual focus. This adds a bit of frustration when trying to capture action from a distance."
4,"Good quality, but lacks some features","This lens does everything it advertises. It takes sharp macro shots and works superbly as a telephoto. As with other telephotos, you'll need a tripod to make use of this lens.My only complaints are the lack of IS and the tight aperture. At 300mm it only opens to f/5.6; this does limit your ability to shoot in low light, but can be mitigated with a tripod. Don't plan on night time action shots, though.Given the choice, I'd buy it again. For the price this is an excellent lens that fills two slots in my bag. It's worth noting that the lens comes with a protective carrying bag and a lens hood."
4,"Nice images, little slow and heavy, weird macro switch","The picture quality is good, the macro mode is great despite a really weird macro switch... It's hard to switch off the macro mode, you have to play with the zoom first (macro works only from 200 to 300).The lens is quite heavy but it's OK for such a zoom lens, autofocus is not the fastest especially in low light but works fine for the price!Be careful not to touch the AF hood when using it in AF or you'll be scared by the noise...A good lens overall."
4,great telephoto for the price,"all is good, i just with it had a zoom lock because when i mount my camera on my B-grip, pointing down, the lens always extends down on its own, so its pretty annoying. and because it lacks image stabilization, getting the shot without blur at 300mm can sometimes be difficult."
1,"Worked for 10 minutes, then AF died","This item arrived with the lens cap not properly attached. Was on crooked. That was the first concern I had. Either this was a poorly packaged returned item, or that it was poorly packaged in general. That being said, I attached it to my D90 and began snapping away. I wanted to check the AF speed and was impressed, however, after about 10 minutes and 20 shots, the AF went dead. I placed my Nikkor 18-105 back on the camera body to see if something else was causing the issue and it worked flawlessly. I was concerned purchasing this product because ""you get what you pay for"" and I should have known better. It doesn't have a very rewarding feel. Adjusting the range really displayed the cheap construction. I wont be exchanging or buying Sigma again because I have no faith in their products lasting."
3,Returngin my 70-300 Sigma,"I recently replaced a broken Nikon 70-210(gorgeous lens and photo quality) with this Sigma.Although it is sharp and is a good lens for the price, it just doesnt have the umph I expected, and was used to with my Nikon.Ergonomically - the zoom ring tends to sick right around 200. Makes working with this piece rather annoying.Good luck."
2,Sigma 70-300 ups and downs,This range just does not seem to have a really good lens on the market right now and hopefully one of the companies who makes K mount lenses will do something about the problem. If I had it to do again I would buy a fixed lens at 300 or 400 in a manual focus lens.
2,Disappointed,I found the lens to be unacceptably noisy in zoom operation. Also did not like just how much the zoom extended.
1,Immature,"""Oneness contains all, all is oneness"" so what? It is just like saying "" Life is all, all is life."" The author did have a momentary experience, but so did many others. Few boasted themselves to be enlightened. The state of oneness did not last in him, so he rushed into conclusions such as above. Ego is also oneness, he said. What a helpful advise!So from this book, you will know "" all is oneness"" which includes all the crap. How helpful! Now let's continue to live in our suffering, and the craziness of the world untill one day the earth is totally screwed up!"
4,Homesick,"A great return from the band that have been on a holiday for too many years, it's nice to hear their good mix of thoughtful lyrics and catchy tunes hasn't been lost.A is for astronaut was clearly written to be the single from the album and has a friendly pop beat. But there are other nice songs in the album that make it a good recommendation. This train... is pretty good stuff, and silverlake is good. The variety of the album is quite wide too, with a mixtures of styles and tempos.It is a perhaps a problem that they have had some absolute classic albums before this in Raintown and When the World knows your name, and so it is very hard to match the quality of these. It perhaps doesn't quite reach those heights, but it's certainly a step in the right direction. Good stuff !!"
3,Has potential,"I like Taylor's own 'Depression Blues' where he produces something new and the standard 'Tin Pan Alley' where he doesn't try to play at a million miles an hour. Obviously a guitarist with potential, but he needs to learn that more is not usually better. An example is 'All Your Love' which starts out fresh and interesting, then loses its way in attempted pyrotechnics. He even closes the album with a putrid song totally out of balance with the rest of the tracks (similar to SRV)."
5,A must have for anyone who buys CD's,"This man is a genius in my eyes. A voice and an acoustic guitar that entertains me for an entire album. His voice is pure butter. A struggling street singer who eventually got a record contract but died before he recieved a check. His story is an amazing one that almost seems like a movie. On this disk he covers mostly old classic soul songs. Hence the title ""Songs From Venice Beach"" Ted knew how to make the money on the street buy playing songs people were familiar with. Don't get the wrong idea though these songs are definetely performed in true Ted Hawkins style. This CD is very comforting it's kind of hard to explain unless you listen to it. You can tell from his music that Ted Hawkins was a very genuine man."
5,"Great for ""The Politics of Dancing""","Great deal, even if just for ""The Politics of Dancing"" by Re-Flex! Other great hits included, too!"
5,Cameron Mini Multi Roaster,"I was looking for a good pot in which to cook one dish meals. It is perfect! Sage-and-Onion Chicken and Sausage from a cooking show [...] worked wonderfully in this pan.The pan is heavy enough not to warp, holds the steam in well, cleans easily, and is a good small / medium family size.One warning.....watch out for the handle on the lid when taking out of the oven.....wear mitts, don't just use hot pads. (Hard lesson to learn!)"
2,The Encyclopedia of Sauces for Your Pasta: The Greatest Collection of Pasta Sauces Ever in One Book,"This book is just ""so-so""Lots of recipies, but most are just different versions of the basic....Nothing really spectacular ar that can't be found online for free."
5,Fantastic- essential for every cook,In an age filled with pasta lovers this book is the essential companion to your supermarkets pasta isle! with an outstanding collection of sauces there is no way that you will ever eat the same dish twice. Perhaps one of the best features is the check list which allows you the oppurtunity to choose for yourself wether or not your family liked it. A true godsend to pasta! Thanks for such a great guide to pasta!
5,Lots of easy and tasty recipes,"I bought this book 10 years ago and have used it time and time again to find quick, easy and tasty sauce recipes for pasta. The book contains so many recipes that I don't think I will ever make even a fraction of them. The best thing about the book is the recipes are listed in the table of contents under the main ingredients so you can easily find for example sauces made from cream which starts on page 3-1. Also, most of the sauce recipes do not require a long list of ingredients so they are easy and inexpensive to make."
1,"Old Fashioned, Not Relevant, LOUD!","This book is completely old fashioned, with old ideas of ingredients, portions, methods, etc. Furthermore, THIS BOOK IS LOUD!! WRITTEN IN ALL CAPS!I paid $1 for this book from Goodwill via Amazon, and I think I wasted 80cents."
3,Not Quite Spillane,"While I have to admit that I find this movie -- in a goofy way -- rather entertaining, Spillane it is not. Still, Assante makes a short swaggering Mike Hammer, Judson Scott as one of the more bizaare villains in movie history, Barbara Carrera and the killer ending like the book."
4,"Armand Assante as ""Mike Hammer"".","For Mature Adults Only! Contains male nudity and full frontal female nudity. Scenes of orgy and sexual situations. Rated ""R"".Based upon the novel by Mickey Spillane.Armand Assante is ""Mike Hammer"", a private detective in new York City. There is a killer on the loose. He has already killed a one-arm cop in his home. Then each furthur victim has some connection to the first victim. Mike Hammer is close on the trail and meets some sexy women along the way. This case is so dangerous he can't even trust his friends on the force.Armand Assante really made this film for me.Also in the cast: Laurene Landon, Judson Scott, Julia Barr, Barbara Carrera, Alan King, Geoffrey Lewis, Paul Sorvino, Lee Anne Harris and Lynette Harris."
4,"Armand Assante as ""Mike Hammer"", 70s/80s","I'm a fan of Assante and this film is very period and maybe dated by some people's standards. Personal feel is this is a must watch. The film captures the Mike Hammer character well though I do feel Stacy Keach was the best and Assante's portrayal gave him an interesting Italian feel. Great visuals from wardobe, to feel of the city, to the eye candy.If you are a fan of the Miami Vice TV series I think you will like this."
3,"""I'll get right on top of this""","This flick starts with a pre-opening credits teaser along the lines of the James bond films. Armand Assante, a forceful, charismatic actor grabs your attention and for the most part keeps it. The absolutely gorgeous Barbara Carrera makes a stunning femme fatale. Not a bad update of Spilanes first Mike Hammer book. It even retains the famous final line. Much truer to the hard-boiled private eye then the watered down tv version of the 80's."
4,The Venus Chronicles,"Carol Gee's book, The Venus Chronicles, is a delightful collection of coming of age stories. Even though her growing up and mine were worlds apart, I found we share many of the same memories and I enjoyed reliving them while reading her book. We are all members of the same sisterhood!"
3,Not as inspiring as I thought,"I bought this after really liking Deep Purple Last Concert In Japan. Ballsy, great guitar work. One of my fav albums. And I really like the version of Wild Dogs. So go to the source. Yes, the album is diverse. Lots of different influences. But the vocals are weak sounding and so too with the songs. I really expected a ballsy album. Much rather DP LCIJ - get the real version not the edited version"
5,Great collection for my life,"I couldn't define Tommy Bolin's music because he's song including everything, rock, jazz, blues and so on. He's not only great guitar player but also great singer, I think. I mostly love 'Savannah Women' in this album.I live in Korea and the reason I bought this one via Amazon was that there were no this CD available in every record shop in Korea in regardless of online and offline. As well as, I tried to find it in Amazon Japan but there wasn't.I really thank you for Amaozon to let me have this CD safely."
3,Martyrdom anybody?,"As good an album as Teaser is, I really wonder if all the praise being heaped here is more a result of excessive hero-worship and the fact that he died young, then it is solely with the playing on this and his other album. I find this to have been the case with Randy Rhodes as well. Both excellent guitarists, both died young, both are now martyred in 70s guitar-god circles. Call me jaded if you will, but that's how I see it.I have Teaser on tape, but it's not something I listen to all the time. Not when I have Jimmy Page, Ritchie Blackmore, Jeff Beck etc...to choose from. Btw, the album didn't sell real well while Tommy was alive, either.I like to give it 3 and 1/2 stars but since I can't, I'll err on the side of caution."
3,Don't Hope Too Much,"Maybe its only a myth, that it improves women's health. It never did any trick to me...in that way am very disappointed. Otherwise, it was okay...it is in fact 'royal jelly'. Use a spoonful of honey to overcome the bitter taste."
2,Tastes horrible,"This honey took 12 days to arrive and it tastes terrible.Expensive for such a small amount of honey.It leaves an oily residue on the surface of hot drinks and doesn't taste like normal honey, it's much stronger."
4,A very good book,This a very good book for beginners in mechanics and stress analysis.It discusses the various types of loading. It explains with details and with lots of examples.
3,And Then What?,"Although I was excited by the premise of Repacking Your Bags, I didn't feel that it lived uop to my expectations. The book is well-written and has interesting examples of people making life changes, but somehow the process never becomes completely clear. Perhaps there's not enough in there about how to unpack the bags and how to decide what to leave behind. Perhaps there's comething amiss in the organization. Despite some excellent information, this just never comes to gethe as a process."
4,Thought provoking read,"This book looks at making decisions about career and life that are in line with one's values. Many times people find themselves living a life that is not satisfying. The authors had that experience and did something about it, now they help other people wrestle with the same issues."
5,A good book and better film,"This is one of Mr. Romers better efforts both as a book and as a video. He takes you places where most folks will never be able to go to. He then takes what you think is nothing and shows you how it is really connected physically to the Hellenistic Era. He has opened my eyes to an era that I had not really thought important but I now see the errors of my ways. His choices of music, locations and his train of thought used in the film are outstanding. I just hope that it comes out in DVD soon. All together a mighty effort that pays off handsomely, Mega Kudos to all hands involved!"
3,Decent Durex,They were okay.They come scented but I could barely noticed any ribs on the condom.A great deal nonetheless.
5,An Amazing Work of Art,"This album by huffamoose is incredible... The songs are unique and beautiful, and they have such wonderful lyrics. Craig Elkins' voice is very seductive and sexy, and he, along with the rest of the band, is truly a genius."
4,Primarily metallic,"After the classically-tinged Fire and Ice (1993), Yngwie Malmsteen returned to his heavy metal roots on this 1994 release. This is one of his hardest albums; the songwriting as well as the guitar work shows the influence of bands like Rainbow and Deep Purple. Most of the material is solid, and there are a few outstanding tracks like Pyramid of Cheops. The vocals are handled by Mike Verscara, who shows himself to be a competent, if not outstanding singer. The mastering on this SPV edition is quite good, resulting in very clear sound. The bonus material here consists of a studio track, In the Distance, rather than the live version of Angel in Heat that was on the earlier Spitfire edition."
2,will burn your food,"The temps listed here are ""safe"" temperatures that will lead you to overcook your food. I understand they do it for safety reasons and all but if you're serious about getting it just right and use a proper instant thermometer to test your meat for doneness, this is going to screw you up. For instance, Cooks Illustrated/America's Test Kitchen recommends 165 for Chicken, and from personal experience, that does happen to be the perfect temp. At 180, as listed here, you'll get an overcooked bird. Sames goes for all the others."
1,old information,These temperatures are from old government standards that have since been revised. Cooking to these temperatures will dry out your food and not significantly increase your food safety.
4,"""Pallet on the Floor"" is worth the cost of the album","Estella Yancey sings with a sureness and a force that certainly belies her years. Her voice verges on the edge of rawness, but that's perfect for the old songs she sings. Her delivery of ""Pallet on the Floor"" alone would be worth the price of the album. Curiously there are times when both the quality of her voice and her phrasing are very reminiscent of Jimmy Scott, despite the great difference in the type of music they sing.Listening to this album brings back some of the wonderful moments I had while living in the U.S."
3,You see what you get.,"ProsProvides a decent scratching areaThe spring moves just enough to perhaps keep the cat's interest, when hitThe ball on top has stayed on, despite the ferocious tries of my cats to remove itThe bell makes some soundConsThe unit tips over easilyAfter initially showing interest in the toy, my cats rarely use it - Catnip does not helpI payed $6 for this thing and I got what I payed for - No more, no less."
3,Is OK,"Princess played with it for half a minute before losing interest. It may be that she was over-stimulated with toys, but after having it hit her nose a couple of times, she decided to just leave it alone. It's put away in her new toy box, maybe she will like it better in a couple of weeks."
1,Cheap junk,"Piece of crap, cat did not like it, threw it in the garbage. Some other cat may like it more than mine."
3,Neither here nor there,It is hard to give a good review on this product since it really depends on you cat. My cat gave it maybe five minutes of attention and hasn't cared for it at all.
3,cats,I was hoping my 3 cats would play with it more than they do. They will rub on it if I put catnip on it. It is a cute little toy for them and maybe they'll get to liking it.
2,Ektelon EKT QT Scream Mid indoor court shoes,"Quite narrow shoe for a Ektelon/Prince style.Shoe smaller than expected, had I know I would have bought a size up from my normal 7.5 US (womens) size."
3,not bad,"Was looking for something like the ones when I was in the Army. This is close but not really there. The material doesn't stretch as much as I would have liked and feels a little rougher than what I was looking for, but still works well."
5,Amazing!,"Okay, i work outside every day of the year. This item goes with me every day I have to be outside in cold weather - it is excellent for keeping the cold wind from getting around your neck and down into your other clothing.....if I had 6 necks, i'd hafta order them by the dozen! lol"
3,good buy!,My son wanted this for Christmas. He says it keeps his neck warm when he runs and works out.He's happy and I'm happy with the quality of the neck warmer.
1,Didn't get it!!,"When I opened the package, excited about a Neck Warmer that I was giving as a gift, it was a FURMINATOR!!! I am in the process if trying to remedy this issue."
1,"Useless, inaccurate, waste of money.","You get what you pay for. I bought this square thinking I'd get accurate right angles on wood boards and squaring up my table saw miter gauge. After multiple frustrating attempts, I gave up. It is absolutely out-of-square and useless for making square cuts on any saw. I wouldn't buy it even it was a dollar. To test it, I tightened the thumb-screw very tight and placed the square against a straight counter top in multiple locations and drew a line with a pencil. I then flipped the square over and drew another line originating from the first. Sure enough, the ends of the marks were nearly 1/16"" off. Bad product and poor quality control. Probably good only for rough framing of houses."
1,Poorly-manufactured junk,"Despite seeing several bad reviews for this combination square at Lowes.com, I thought perhaps Amazon was selling a slightly different model since all the reviews here were 5-star (correction: there was one 4-star review). When mine came, I was disappointed to see the machining was very poor all around. Maybe I just got a bad one, but I don't understand how it passed quality control. The body had gouges in it from manufacturing, the ruler/blade itself was not machined square (as viewed from the smallest face), and the blade was bowed. I might have been able to live with the first or maybe even the second defect, but given multiple obvious defects, I did not trust it to give me accurate, square measurements. If someone had just handed me this square, I would have assumed it was some off-brand piece of junk from Walmart that was sitting at the bottom of a bargain bin. The fact that the blade was not flat was the biggest deal-breaker. Fortunately, Amazon gave me a refund."
3,"Good Square, Easy to Break","This square by Swanson (TC132) is good value for the cost. The blade is easy to read, etched nicely, and has multiple measurements. It required no correction for squareness - came properly square. However, the spring-loaded bolt that grips the blade is poorly made and easy to break, with the tip fracturing under use and unable to grip the blade. Time to buy a new square but will look for another manufacturer that does a better job of designing a bolt to secure the blade."
5,Great Quality,"I love this mechanics' square by swanson. So many times, I'm afraid to purchase tools before I put them in my hand, because at low prices, they are likely poorly made. This square is a solid tool and very heavy for the size. I was impressed. Also, the locking mechanism stays locked. If you're looking for a low priced, high quality mechanics' square. This is a great deal."
5,Ozzy's 'Best Of' CD all fans should own,"Forget the Epic release of this CD, this Sony Music release blows it away! Contains an extra CD with tracks such as 'Walk on Water' heard only in the 'Beavis and Butthead Do America' soundtrack. Following that is a very interesting track, which has Ozzy himself singing for Type O Negative in a song called 'Pictures of Matchstick Men'.. The extra CD is wrapped up by an interview in the early 90's. Well worth the money!"
4,Great duo,"It's an intimate and intense record,with some pieces very dramatic ""Vashkar"",some pieces nearly moving,""Sweeping up"",""Chelsea bells"" ""Domino biscuits"". They are fantastic musicians and I am an italian vibist and then I'm a Gary's admirer."
4,A Mixed Bag,"I bought a vinyl copy of this album for a reasonable price. The musicianship is excellent. I especially love Burton's vibes. The compositions are a mixed bag, however."
2,Pretty Boring!,Author is trying to take on too many things but fails to deliver.- He talks about Greed- He talks about Market Irrationality- He talks about his failuresFinally it comes off as rambling various different subjects with no depth to understand the causes.
1,denby doesn't deliver,"I didn't find the book involving on any level. I expected a gripping read. After all, the memoir covers a period of Denby's life when he lost his wife to divorce and $800,000 to the stock market bubble. Denby hints at the personal devastation he experiences, but is far too guarded to allow the reader to feel the true depth of his turmoil. At least this reader. The book also lacks focus. Included are portions of movie reviews, re-worked New Yorker interviews with Henry Blodgett and descriptions of 'fabulous' parties held by Sam Waksal, the founder of ImClone. I found it hard to have empathy for Denby, who comes off as a name-dropping wanna-be rich guy who still hasn't learned his lesson."
1,"Oh, Please...","As a title, ""American Schmuck"" may have been more apt. Rarely has there been a more incisive portrait of the effete, weak, narcissistic and self-indulgent New Yorker than this book.Denby is unwilling to recognize the American disease of conspicuous consumption that has left this culture morally bankrupt and spiritually empty.Only an American in the 21st century would think accumulating wealth and possessions could justify his existence.If you must read this, get a library copy. It's not worth the purchase price."
3,An interesting read but...,"American Sucker is a good quick read book that draws you into a roughly 3 year time frame in David's life. Unfortunately the details are missing for those engineers/analytical readers like myself. For example, how much did David start with in the market? How much did he lose on each position? We know he inherited $350k from his mom and know he ended up losing close to $1 million--in real losses not paper losses or from the height of the market. David says he ended up even in the end with gains and losses over about 10 years (or thereabouts). I'm surprised him and his journalist/book writer wife would have that much money to lose and still come out with few battle scars (my impression). The extra 10-20 pages adding these details would have gone a long way in making this a much better autobiography of David's downward spiral in tech investing."
1,What has Denby learned? Nothing!,"To hear this author go on countless talk shows hawking this shallow bubble of a book is depressing. ""American Sucker"" is about an extremely accomplished and educated man who surrounds himself with Manhattan sycophants and billionaires, and thinks that if he hangs out with them, he can become one of them. It is hard to muster any pity over his extreme immaturity (at age 59) in pouring his savings into the Gen X internet bubble. Despite his divorce, Denby.... has always been and is still... married to an empty pursuit of celebrity, Wall Street, Hollywood, and surface glitz. Like Janet Jackson baring her breast for record sales, Denby pulls out ""depression"" and name dropping in an attempt to create a best seller."
1,A must have for every insomniac,I have read the book and the reviews...I find that the good reviews are very Denbyesk....I think David Denby spent more time writing reviews for his book than he did writing the book itself.So self-indulgent and boring...a must have for the insomniac.
1,No thanks...,"A poorly written, unorganised, and dissapointing book which will go nowhere in getting the reasonably unknown history of Armenia on the map. Certainly not one for the first timer..."
4,Incorrect Description,"The description is incorrect. What is really on this disk or the stories ""The Ballad of Little Joe"", ""Gideon: Tuba Warrior"" and ""Rack Shack and Benny"". It was bummer for us since we want ""Sweet Pea"" but we are still glad to have ""Gideon"" and having our daughters favorites on one disk will mean less to take when we travel."
5,Awsome 80's revival!!,"This album has redeemed my faith in new music! If you enjoy 80's genre then you will surely enjoy this album. The song ""Electric"" could have easily been a hit in the 80's.Each song has a chrous that is right up there with Pulp's ""Different Classes"" album. Also has some simliarities to Suede in many ways.I don't think this album will dissapoint you!"
2,Not the best,"Although the chair wasn't horrible, I had 2 problems with it. Most important, the legs are adjustable but after some months of use one of the legs slipped and became shorter. It stripped the adjustment workings so I couldn't fix it. Also the chair is a bit difficult to clean although I don't know how that could be made better."
4,Excellent transaction,"Product arrived in a timely manner, just as advertised. Thank you!The condoms themselves aren't quite as good as the inSpiral brand that they seem to mimic, but they're way better than most others I've used."
1,Dangerous,"The ""turn on"" part of this design is well though out. You have to make a deliberate double action to turn on the tool.Unfortunately, the ""turn off"" part is not nearly as good. A switch like this should immediately turn off with a single slap. Instead, you have to work the slide lock before you can turn the tool off. It's almost as hard as turning it on, and in an emergency (e.g. you get clothing or a finger caught in the router), it's worse than useless."
3,Good size and grip.,I bought this for my son. it's for small hands. Th webbing provides an excellent grip and the small size makes it easy to handle.
1,Account edge warning,"Account edge customer service is terrible, there had been a problem since day 1 with logging on to the program, and I could not get any answers...The only answer customer service had was to call there tech line, which is $4.00 a minute...I was promised calls back to remedy my situation...never got any. I emailed the general manager with my concerns, and she never responded...DISGUSTING!!!!! Buyer beware!!!!!"
5,Fascism and Hermeticism clash in Venice @ 1930,"Who is translating the creation myth for the cats of Venice while on a search for Solomon's magic jewel? It can only be Corto Maltese!Corto Maltese, Hugo Pratt's most famous character, is a picaresque rogue roving the world of the early 20th century in a series of 1970's-era comic strips. This adventure is a strange, almost dreamlike intrigue involving Italian Fascists, Theosophists, and Masons, in a search for a gem hidden by the infamous Baron Corvo. As usual Pratt demonstrates incredible command of characterization, plotting, and history in the very confined space of a graphic novel."
3,Not as bad as all that...,"It all started to go wrong when Damon and Greame started wearing those strange jeans. You know the ones, with the arse hanging round about their knees! Before that they wore the tight trousers of pop and had the guts to write listenable music.I like this album, I think it's pretty good and it pisses me off to hear Blur constantly slagging it off as some sort of terrible mistake.Get this and Parklife of you want to hear Blur before they disappeared up their own backside(s)."
4,"A much darker ""Parklife""","From 1992 to 1995, Blur was consistent in its ability to release better music than any other band in Britain (or for that matter America--how many good bands can you name that are still around from that same time period?) ""Modern Life Is Rubbish"" was excellent, but merely paved the way for the masterpiece that was ""Parklife"". The following year the band followed up with ""The Great Escape"", which was at once a departure from their usual work as well as a rehash of previous material. (A good example of the former is ""The Universal"", and for the latter check out ""Top Man"", which is really just a slowed-down ""Tracy Jacks"".) You could tell they were running out of ideas with this album, but it doesn't stop you from listening to it with the same enthusiasm as their previous CDs. Buy it, you won't be disappointed. Top tracks: 1,2,4,5,7,10,12-15."
4,Trilogy's End,"Of Blur's english trilogy ""The Great Escape"" has alway struck me as the less inspired record probably because of the two or three annoying songs it has in it(the Ray Davies aping ""Ernold Same""at the top of them) and at the same time for sounding less fresh and a bit more designed for success than previous efforts.While far from being a bad record ""The Great Escape""doesn't seem to recapture ""Modern Life is Rubbish""s innocence or to present a band at the absolute top of their game as ""Parklife""did.But all this is forgotten in the presence of the several cuts that do honor their name.And they're not as few as one might think since there's about 8-9 songs that are actually compelling and, as usual with Blur, fun to listen to(Stereotypes,Entertain me,He thought of Cars,Top Man and Fade Away among my favorites).A more than worthy addition to their catalog though not the best starting place for beginners."
5,Not As Brilliant As 'Parklife' But Still A Band At Its Peak,"Blur's follow-up to 'Parklife', this disc continues the band's ironic lyricplay concerning the empty, repetitive state of modern life in Britain. My favorite track is the lovely 'Yuko & Hiro', a fitting counterpoint to the matched track #15 of 'Parklife', the equally brilliant 'This Is A Low'. Other notable tracks are 'Universal', 'He Thought Of Cars', and 'Ernold Same'. 'Parklife' caused Blur to blow-up in popularity; 'Great Escape' is their work on top of the mushroom cloud."
4,the great escape is a great album,"more great songs from Blur. great packaging, superb musicianship and brilliant lyrics. with 15 songs, there is *almost* too much good music here to fully digest in one sitting. and sometimes these songs seem to be jagged or too aloof to really enjoy; but then you'll find yourself humming the melodies in your head and you'll have to go back and listen again and again. finely crafted pop songs with a huge dose of english humor and healthy sarcasm. ""The Universal"" is probably my favorite Blur song of all time, but there are plenty of other great ones here like ""Stereotypes,"" ""Charmless Man,"" and ""He Thought Of Cars."" and is it just me; or does ""Best Days"" sound like it may have hugely influenced some songs in the Radiohead canon?"
4,The Great Escape,"I really like this album, moreso than anything their fierce rival Oasis has put out. Whereas Oasis flaunts their influences, Blur draws on them without fanfare, providing many Beatlesque melodies including the beautiful, psychedelic-waltz,""The Universal,"" with horns that conjure up images of ""Penny Lane."" Other standout tracks are ""Stereotypes,"" and ""Country House."" I love the 60's backing vocals of ""Country House."" That song is also a favorite for my band to play live. All in all this is a good album and ranks up there with my favorite Blur albums."
1,Lame.,"Jeez, how can a record age so quickly? When it came out, I thought this was cool... now all I can say is that It's profoundly boring, repetitive, lame. I tried to sell my copy at a second-hand shop recently, the shop assistant didn't want it because he had too many of them. Avoid unless you're a diehard Blur fan."
5,beautiful!,"Blur is amazing, I have been listening to them for almost 8 years. They are not only musicians they are magicians. They are geniuses! The effects they use, the lyrics, and the mood that is set is wonderful. this is one of their best albums but I recomend them all."
3,"One last ""try"" before they really started trying...","This album is good. And its true that this album isn't as immediate is Parklife, and thats why it suffers. I loved it the other day when I was sleeping on the couch and it was on, but the thing I loved about Parklife was singing along. This isn't supposed to be a mellow album, and thats why it doesn't work (fully). Pulp didn't follow up Different Class with Different Class II and then move on to ..Hardcore. But Blur essentially did, they realized this direction wasn't working and began trying very hard to unlearn their style. Ernold Same rides the same train... Is it any wonder their next big hit was ""Woo Hoo""?"
5,this is of REAL MUSIC ARRANGEMENT.,"Since this album, i know how good music can be arranged in such layered way. it contains tones of instruments playing together but you will never feel they are mess. you can hear that those instruments are reacting with each others perfectly , unlike other rock bands just playing different instruments by different musicians all by their own ideas individually without intra- communication.lyrics are of great importance in this album. you gotta study it in deep so that you can really know what Damon is trying to present. it is so cynical to urban people.Does McNormal chips surround you all the day? are you the one insist in wearing Calvin Kleins in bed? hoohoo....do u think wife swapping is the future?the photo at the back is that they are wearing suits and facing the computer to look like office men. what a big fun! yes, they are so funny. just as this album."
1,Excessive and awful.,"After the era-defining and diverse Parklife album, Blur went on to create the Great Escape. Somewhat cynical in tone lyrically, it is clear to see a band on the brink of implosion with the excessively perky arrangements. The lead single Country House was released on the same day as Oasis's Roll With It. Oasis made it to the number one spot subsequently winning the 'battle'. And rightly so, Country House's smirkiness was not what the public wanted and they preferred Oasis's (then) working class authenticity. Overall, Th Great Escape is an over the top, theatrical mess and completely grating. Blur ended up releasing 1997's selft-titled album which, stylistially, was a complete reverse of The Great Escape and saw them embracing American indie-pop amongst other genres. And thank god they did!"
3,Some great songs but some awful ones,"This album is a mixture of britpop with songs like charmless man and country house but some of the album seems to be exploring other types of music with songs like yuko & hiro. About 10-11 songs are complete rubbish, the only good songs are sterotypes, charmless man, country house and the universal. This album certainly seeing blur making a great escape from britpop."
2,2 Additional Tracks,"The two additional tracks on this import are: ""Ultranol"" and ""No Monster In Me."" Both of these tracks are available on the CD1 single for ""The Universal."
5,Best of all time,A perfect combination from the worlds most successfull artist through time. With magic melodies Enya takes You to places were only your mind rules. A Must have for all fans out there!!
5,The Power of the Sublime Image,"Photographer Lynn Davis is one of the best living artists working today. Lynn has an amazingly rich quality in her work which is often simple in format. A purist's take on architectural, monumental sites, and natural wonders. Her subject moves from nature to the sacred, as her travels have taken her to places such as Greenland, Africa, Cambodia, etc. This book is a most suitable document for a very important contemporary photographer."
3,"OK, but not what I expected","Nice music, but I expected to see more of the landmarks os Seville, especially given the cover photos. Instead, more than half of the scenes are just parks and people around town --could be anywhere. If you are looking for a traveller's guide to Seville, this might not be it."
1,Don't expect to connect it to WPA access point,"There is simply no driver for this adapter to connect to an access point with WPA2 turn on. If you are only connecting with WEP it's OK. You get what you paid for.----------As FilG pointed out the manufacturer does noted that this device is only ""Hardware-based 40/64-bit & 128-bit WEP encryption"". Add back 2 stars to this rating."
3,"If you want traditional British, look elsewhere","I was looking for authentic English recipes for afternoon tea and was disappointed when I got this book. A lot of the recipes have more of an international flair (e.g.,smoked salmon BAGEL, cheese puff guacamole, pineapple & ginger cake) and the author does explain that the chefs give their offerings a modern, alterated twist. Admittedly, these recipes look very delicious, but I wanted something more specific to traditional British tea time."
4,Nice,Like these frames alot but hanging them is a pain. Once hung they look great. I love the look. Thanks
3,A decent blues album - with one killer track,"For the most part this is a workmanlike electric blues album - lots of songs about waking up in the morning, rocking your town, etc., with some tasty guitar work.Track 5, ""Your affection is gone"", however, is wonderful. From the crackling guitar intro, this is a good song with great pace, a couple more great guitar breaks, and some lovely keyboard work in the backing. Sort of Robert-Cray-meets-the-Isley-Brothers, and a great tune for the car.This kind of album alwys puzzles me: how did the guy come up with one song so much better than the rest?"
2,What the ...?!,"I ordered this book because it had gotten an average of four stars, and it was on my recommendations list. After reading the first chapter, I realized that this book was not really to my liking. Some may find this book ""erotic"", but I am not one of those people. There is lots of sex, so some readers will not be disappointed in that aspect, but the whole storyline is unrealistic, and most of the sexual encounters are meaningless. I could not believe the two main characters would ""be in love"" with each other based on the circumstances they found themselves facing. In addition to the overall disappointment with the book, that ending the author chose is like a slap in the face."
2,This Trail is very cold...,"I agree with many of the reviewers that the authorlost track of the highly anticipated love story betweenJake Slater and Ben Masters.There isn't any love story.The story's basic theme is:How many times can you get laid...in one hour.I agree that rape is rampant theme throughout this book,with murders and even scalpings.It is the Wild Wild West.Let us have more loving. Not killing.Then they have so-called ""willing"" sex amidst the carnage.Jake Slater is the key hot man of the story,as is Travis at the start of the book, the real main manis Major Stephen Preston, let us read more about him in the sequel.I do believe that Zavo should be tied to a doorand given a taste of his own medicine, for leaving ushanging with an incomplete book.Zavo probably will have more men having indiscriminatesex with anyone with three legs..well you get the idea."
5,"A healer and a helper for a wounded, grieving soul",This book helps to see that the world of the disabled can bring joy and love as well as heartache. It really helped me to better understand and accept the death of my 20 month old Down Syndrome son. I read it as a child and knew it was something special but after my son died I read it again and knew it was something extraordinary
4,A short and beautiful story.,I bought this as a present for my wife and it moved both of us to tears. Wonderful.
1,Angel Unaware,This book was misrepresented in the its sale description and picture. The cover was torn and ripped and the book was in poor condition. No where in the ad was it stated that this was a used library book and it had library stamps in it and sign out cards and sleeves still in it. I was very disappointed with the quality.
5,Heart Warming,"I read this book when my son, who has Down syndrome, was 6 months old. We had already gone through the heart surgery and numerous other health related issues that comes with the disability. I really felt conncected with this family and coouldn't put the book down until I was done. Everything they spoke about was so true in how you feel and react to situations. You come to realize the more important things in life. It doesn't matter how much money or fame you have, all you need is to love your child for who they are. That is all any child ever needs or wants. If you are ever in doubt when given a special needs child you should read this book. It will change your outlook on it forever."
5,It has stayed with me for 43 years now-unforgettable!,My Mom let me read this book when I was seven. Something magical happened at that point that has remained with me my entire adult life. I don't know what happened to that book after I read it; but I know that I need to own it now and read it again to try and understand such an impact at such an early age. Such words from the heart - lessons for a lifetime.
5,A Story Revisited,I read this when i was probably about 15 or so. It is very inspirational and I recomend to anyone who has lost a child or has a friend who has.
4,Shear Bolts for Ariens Snow Blower,"Great Price, I'm sure I'll end up using all 10 in the next several years with a gravel driveway."
1,2 PACK. NOT A GOOD DEAL,Do your research before ordering. In the past this was a 10-pack of nuts and bolts as you can see for older reviews. Under the technical details it has now changed to a 2-pack. I made the mistake of ordering a quantity of 2 thinking I would get 20 for a good price. When it arrived I received a total of 2 nuts and 2 bolts at a cost of $17.09 including shipping. You can get a 3-pack at Home Depot for $14.99. Talked with customer service and they were willing to send me 2 additional nuts and bolts but nothing else. Instead I had them returned and received a full refund including shipping. At the same time I had my snowblower worked on and my local shop sold me these for $1.50 a piece. With shipping Amazon cannot beat my local shops price.
2,"Large bolts, not small ones","The item description promises small bolts, but I've got large ones - useless for my snow thrower model. I am sending them back."
1,Boohbah Wiggle & Giggle,"This product initially seemed very promising on booting up and my pre-schooler was quite excited. Well that was until the program kept locking up when playing several of the games (requiring us to kill the program using the Task Manager). We have many software titles that work successfully on our computer but this one just doesn't (in fact this is the first of 30+ software titles we have that has a problem). It may be the case that the game can't play nice with certain anti-virus/spyware/firewall pages, issues with certain graphics cards, etc. but I wouldn't know because BrighterChild's support page is useless. We bought this for $2 and we overpaid -- well at least until this software is patched or any semblance of a FAQ page is set up. Buyer Beware!"
4,"Good Lights, little unusual, but well made","Other writers are correct - the studs (bolts) are a little short, but they worked OK for me - I am going through about 1/4"" thick steel. The bolts get a little longer as you tighten them down, as the heads sink into the plastic holders which help prevent them from turning as you tighten. One thing to note is that these led lights are not grounded by the housing bolts/studs as is a normal trailer light. Instead, there is a small grounding wire coming from inside the housing which must be attached to the trailer frame or you must run this ground wire to the white ground wire on your wiring harness. The ground wire is short - about 8"" long and has an eyelet on the end which will accommodate a small screw or bolt to fasten it onto the trailer frame. Lights are bright and the housing and lenses are relatively sturdy."
3,"Work great!, challenging to install","Lights are terrific. The only thing is that the mounting bolts are extremely short, and at least one of them turned while tightening the nuts. It was especially difficult to install the one with the license plate bracket as with that added thickness the bolts were flush with the holes in the bracket. Some creativity was required to complete the installation. Despite that, I still love the lights."
5,Great Lights At A Great Price!!,"These lights have held up well to the salt water enviroments of the Pacific Northwest.No longer do I have to always remember to unplug the trailer lights before launching!""Stuff4boats"" Great vendor with great prices!"
5,great buy,I was changing lights on two boat trailers every year due to the salt water. I put these on and they have now been working for three seasons and they still work. I even ran one into a rock and cracked it and it continues to work while all taped up with electrical tape.It is worth every penny I paid to have lights that work when I want to go fishing!
2,Difficult to grasp,This book has too much lingo for an average reader or someone with limited knowledge of this subject. I don't like it personally.
1,e-business jibberish,"If you know anything about branding you'll be tempted to heave this book from a moving car. Despite the authors making the looney assertion that ebay is ""disintermediating"" (""removing the middle-man"" for those of us who prefer to communicate rather than obscure) Sotheby's and Christie's, I hung on for 50 pages, hoping they'd get to the point. The point appears to be that having a strong corporate brand is a good idea. I agree, it was a good idea 20 years ago when Philip Kotler said it. Save your money."
5,perfect resource,"Dr. Leslie Vernick has written a book that is the most practical and well-balanced book I've seen on depression. It is compassionate, honest, and founded on her vast experience as a family counselor, but is also biblically encouraging.This is a book I will recommend to pastors, to friends, to loved ones, and to anyone who needs a promising resource to help in the fight against depression."
4,Take time for yourself and read this book,"Leslie Vernick has written this book with her heart and soul. This is not a typical self-helf glossy book, but a gentle read that is like walking and talking with a professional who is holding your hand. Our culture may teach us that becoming depressed is our own fault, that we must never admit to being depressed, and we must simply pull ourselves out of it. The Christian culture might even suggest to us that if we are straight with God, we'd not be depressed either. But Vernick dispells those lies and gives practical help to her readers."
1,Not the Passenger I expected.,"I bought this expecting to receive a Passenger CD. The Passenger from Britain, not some horrific, screaming, ranting, crap that came out of my CD speakers when I put this in. I must be more careful about choosing a CD with groups of the same name. Now I'm stuck with this horror. Well, my nephew or a co-worker might like it."
5,Read it and decide....,"Yes, the hype around this book has been tremendous; and Richard Mason seems to have the looks and charm to sell his book even if it weren't read-worthy. However, the novel holds its own telling a great story of robust characters and demands a moral honesty from the reader. A literary feat. Watch this writer."
5,Finally an author who can write!,"What a pleasure and delight it was to read Richard Mason's Drowning People. It was incredibly well written. The story itself is perhaps not the best, but the sheer eloquence of Richard's writing is pure pleasure. I simply loved this book - a wonderful debut."
2,Long and Stuffy!,"""I daresay old boy, jolly good effort but bloody pretentious and snotty, not to mention a bit of a BORE I'm afraid."" Seriously, good writing often comes from simplicity of form and ideas not by overdone philosophycal drivel on human emotions or by theatrical writing structure and unusual adverbs. As for the author's age and looks: let's stick to the content of the narrative rather than the photograph on the dust jacket shall we? Don't waist your time. Borrow it from the library if you must."
2,Don't believe the hype,"I had read somewhere that this book is like The Beach by Alex Garland and The Secret History by Donna Tartt. It's not. Richard Mason is either trying to write in a pseudo-gothic style for atmosphere, or he is simply writing the way he thinks that a grown-up should. The result is a poe-faced, archaic story with dreadful dialogue. The story is good, though and there are some nice literary devices, but he should have sat on it a while instead of letting the publishers hype him as a child genius."
2,"mediocre story, dull writing","Beware the hype on this one. The story itself is OK, and is just about interesting enough to get you through to the end, but the characters are irritating beyond belief and the tone of the whole thing is unremittingly earnest. I didn't so much as smirk while reading this. As a portrayal of posh kids in London it's not too far off the mark, but I can't be more generous than that. The publishers will have you believe they've discovered a major new talent - they haven't."
2,Not convincing,"I picked this book up in the UK and was surprised to discover after reading it that it was being 'hyped' over there. It's a remarkably flat and ungainly read, the style erratic and curiously old-fashioned. The narrative is also very clunky and, for me at least, rarely came to life. I found the depictions of the emotional life of the characters almost painfully unconvincing. The author is young, but I can't see that this is something that readers should be expected to take into account. Maybe Mr Mason should do a little more living before writing about life. I'm afraid he hasn't really got the picture yet (and sitting in a study somewhere he probably won't)."
1,ANNOYINGLY SOPHOMORIC!,"Do you know anybody in the 1990's that sent out telegrams?! Well, that's what Mr. Mason's characters do- whatever! This book holds the distinction of having the best opening line, followed by the worst story I've drudged through since Nicholas Sparks's ""Message in a Bottle."""
1,A Big Disappointment,"The blurb on the cover of this book compared it to ""Rebecca."" This contrived, pretentious piece of fluff can't hold a candle to Daphne du Maurier's work. The characters are poorly drawn, the plot is completely implausible and ludicrous descriptions like ""the fine bones of her neck...showing clearly through her pale skin"" (what's he referring to? her vertebrae?) had me laughing at things the author clearly didn't intend to be funny. The book keeps building up to these big ""revelations"" which turn out to be just plain boring. I'm sure when the author turns 30 and looks back on this book, he is going to be completely embarrassed."
1,So many words...so little said.,Some of the most ineffective storytelling I've ever read. If there's an audio version of the book it'd be great at bedtime...forget about Nitol.
1,anything but that,I read the book in part because I'd seen so many reviews and wanted to see what it was like. The one thing I wasn't expecting was for it to be boring and a bit long winded. Despite what the reviews say to me the book does sound like it was writen by a 20 year old which does cause a small problem since the narrator is supposed to be a 70 year old man remembering his youth. as for the plot - who cares? The ending is obvious and the people are so cold and self involved that it is impossible by the end to care what they've done to themselves.
2,Disappointing Debut,"Given the hype this first novel received, and its reputed prodigy author, I was disappointed to find this a cliche-ridden, poorly written work of fiction. I think many readers will agree with me and will find some of the conflicts that shape the plot hard to believe, especially ones that sound as if they belong in a Henry James novel and not in one written at the end of the 20th century. Mason gets two stars from me just because it's a first novel. Save your money, don't buy this book and wait till Mason improves his writing skills."
1,Words fail me,"It's a pity they didn't fail the author of this atrocious book. Comparisons to The Secret History by Donna Tartt have been made. The themes of youth, treachery, passion, betrayal and finally torment are similar. The writing, a thin cop. I'm on vacation at the beach. This book was flung over the porch railing into the gulf at 1a.m. this morning."
4,Intriguing book,"I listened to the book, and liked the narration. Even though the first few lines tell one what happens at the end of the story, the author did a good job of getting us there. He meets Ella Harcourt in a park, and the story takes off from there. I never really got to like her, and was not sure why he loved her so much. But then, that is life, and one can never see what others see.The tragedy of Eric is not dealt with in a convincing manner (eg, how could his parents swallow such a weak story). Also, cousins can never look so alike that they are mistaken for each other as they share only 25% of their genes. I found that a little problematic. At the end, I felt that I had a view of the evil that men (and women) are capable of, and that was not a comforting feeling.If you are able to take a few assumptions with a pinch of salt, this book is worth reading and definitely worth listening to. I look forward to his next book."
2,"catchy premise in narcissistic, overwrought prose","You can tell this was written by a talented adolescent who has been hearing, all his life, how gifted he is. Where he allows himself to get on with the story (about 1/3 of the manuscript), the plot is very good and the details compelling. The 2/3 of the 344 pages, however, that consist of self-absorbed psychology and half-baked philosophy, however, severely dilute what might have been a powerful tale."
2,"Melodramatic style, creaky plot","I fell for the promotional splurge on this title, but was sorely disappointed. The rather gothic plot is predictable and unrealistic, and the style often very melodramatic. Rather like watching a high school performance of something adapted from Edgar Allen Poe, but without the originality. I expected a whole lot better."
1,Weak fluff without a point and flat prose.,"I am embarrassed to be reading this book and it only because I hate to put a book on the shelf unread that I am compelled to finish it. The characters simply do not exist and I found not one beautiful phrase in the 200 pages I have read. I think the plot is a soap opera. Who lives like this and talks like this? I have no compassion for these people. Worse, I have learned nothing from reading this book. What a huge disappointment. My reading group would have kicked me out had we added this to our list without my first having a go at it."
1,Overwritten and unappealing!,"A disappointment after all the hype. The story line was slow, the plot devices clumsy, and the characters flat and unconvincing. There are so many well-written and compelling new novels out there. Would this novel have sunk out of sight in a matter of weeks without Warner's huge ad budget? Even the promos are misleading; they excerpt the opening but leave out the long-winded phrases between the first and last section of the introductory paragraph. Really not worth even the discounted price..."
4,A LOOK AT THE THE DARK SHADOWS BENEATH THE RAYS OF LOVE...,"For the first attempt by a novice , 'The Drowning people ' is a definite winner!Its a fresh view of a murder _ from the murderer's point of view...Richard Mason has painted a vivid picture of the main characters -James & Ella... & Eric - they linger on in the mind long after u put the book down...Its a must-read -not just for the sheer pleasure but because it gives an insight into how small seemingly insignificant acts can change the winds of our life & blow us off our chosen path into the path of destruction...how every action does have an equal & opposite reaction... someday somewhere u pay for your sins...I think Richard Mason has a lot of potential & look forward to reading his future literary attempts!"
2,"Nice story, but too predictable.","Eloquently written, but ultimately predictable. The story kind of dragged on."
3,"Very good plot, but literarily too pretentious","I really liked the plot. It's the type of story that keeps you reading. Especially the scenes in Prague are beatiful. In that sense it really looks a lot Donna Tarrt's The Secret History. However, whereas Tartt writes at a determined pace, Mason is too pretentious in describing his ""major themes"", which slows down the pace annoingly. Furthermore, he has practically nothing to add at a thematic level. That makes his writing sometimes even presumptuous. Another aspect I didn't like is the constant repitition of certain phrases. I didn't count, but he mentions dozens of times that he should stick to his story and not walk ahead: he couldn't be more right. Overall, a more than average book, but it deserves this qualification entirely by its story-telling skills. As a thriller it is superb, as a litarary thriller it fails."
1,Dull - Long winded - predictable - juvenile,"I have to admit that by the middle of this book I was skimming, hoping for some brief ray of light. There was so much boring fore-shadowing- chapters of predicting really bad things to come - that nothing short of mass murder could have lived up to that angst. Instead we get a ""Duh"" moment - any one who enjoys even the most banal mysteries was there before the book was. The author may be forgiven writing a bad book but who the heck agreed to publish this drivel?"
3,The guy was only TWENTY?,"This book seems to generate a lot of heated discussion; and I, adding my two cents' worth, merely wish to say that for an adolescent writing from the perspective of an old man, I found it to be quite astonishing. The plot was a bit too derivitive (Henry James, Wharton, blah blah blah) and certainly the old ""Evil Twin"" twist wasn't any gem of literary brilliance. But hey! I read the paperback while on vacation at my in-laws', and I was absorbed -- if not by the stellar dialogue -- at least I wanted to find out how in heck a guy could kill his wife of 45 years. And take 300 pages to do it.It's not the worst book I ever read, and if this is a debut effort, I am going to keep my eye on this guy. When you're striving to bury yourself in a novel (at your in-laws') a good old English murder mystery is just the ticket."
1,The Drowning People,I was going to review this book until I read the one given by an Oregon reader on March 20 and quite frankly that says it all for me. Very disappointing read especially after all the hype. I was also very confused about when the story was supposed to have taken place - the diction used could hardly be described as modern. I hope the publisher doesn't indulge other authors just because of youth. I won't be fooled into reading another book that is so repetitive and longwinded. The story could have been told in half as many words and with half as much angst.
3,"Good book, DISAPPOINTING ENDING.","I really enjoyed this book because it was a ""why did it"" and not a ""who did it"". But, the ending was very disappointing and puzziling. I too was surprised to learn that Sarah did actually kill Alexander but the way in which the 70 year old James puts two and two together still remains a mystery to me. Maybe I missed something or maybe someone can answer this for me, but how did he make such a great leap from finding a hidden key to Sarah being the actual killer? Very confusing. Other than that, I thought it was very enjoyable and it held my interest all the way to the end."
3,This was not bad for a first time author-not bad at all. . .,"The Drowning People made me feel like I was drowning in the dense prose. The story was promising, the characters though were either manipulative or incredibly stupid, yet for some reason I remained interested until the end. The author did conveniently forget about the science of modern forensics-like why didn't the police check the victim for gunpowder on her hands? Didn't they examine whether or not it was feasible for the victim to have even shot herself from that position? What about immediately suspecting the husband? Oh I forgot--the story takes place in England."
3,A few too many cobwebs...?,"Quite enjoyed the start. However the narrator didn't turn out to be as interestingly evil as I'd hoped, and after a while I found his style a bit heavy going. The lack of context, which some other readers have commented on, does matter I think, not because references to technology are important in themselves, but because some sense of a real world out there might have made the events in the tale seem more anchored, and therefore credible. The dialog's a little creeky too. A great effort for a teen, but not quite enough oomph for this reader anyway."
2,Stagey and rhetorical,"It may be that this novel fits into a mystery/fantasy genre which I'm not aware of or into, but I found this a very self-conscious read, and too removed from believable lives to be compelling. I didn't believe the murder, still less the 'games' played among the major characters. There are some good descriptive bits, but the whole tale is undermined by the annoying overdone style."
4,"It's the story, stupid","Once again neurotic critics jumped at the chance to criticize a work publish but the youngest literary phenom. From the opening lines to the closing passages from the perspective of the 21st century, Mason engages a reader in a strangely surreal and vaguely gentile journey through the mind of a man who has lived his life through people and places and not (so much) through time. I cannot remember when I last read a modern novel which used language as something undisturbed by so-called ""real"" modes of speech and diction. At times characterization slips and his technique has not been refined but the kid has a gift of telling a story. It's a good read and has echoes, I think, of henry james. Derrida discovered a while back that the author is dead. He only seems to be revived by tormented, still unpublished 40 year old critics who feel threatened by true genius."
4,Unusually good,"I read a lot of first novels - and have seldom encountered one as assured or mature as this. With practised ease, Mason handles a complex (but gripping) plot, and manages to look at large life issues with clear-headed insight. Loved his style, too - his words flow very easily. Almost gave it 5 stars, but am going to leave that for his second novel.... Let's just hope it's as good as this one."
4,a ho-hum story brought to life by terrific prose...,"Richard Mason should be proud. It is hard to believe that a 20 year old university student can produce such sumptious prose in his first novel ('The Drowning People'). The words flow beautifully. Not only is it an effortless read, the prose is on par with the best of today's fiction writers. So yes, I loved this book. However the story itself isn't exactly flawless.The story is a about a love triangle (actually, a quadrangle) set in modern London. A talented violinist falls in love with a troubled young woman with a bizarre past. The bane of this woman's existence is her identical cousin (..hmmm, sounds like 'The Patty Duke Show'). Further complicating matters is the relationship of a (very close) male friend. Sounds like a soap opera? Well, it actually works better than it sounds. A bit contrived, but thanks to the prose it is all compulsive reading.Bottom line: a fantastic debut of a promising writer. Recommended."
5,Why the hype?,"This is a question I often ask myself when reading well-publicised novels (particularly when they are written by photogenic Hugh-Grant-of-the-written- word young men, who must be a publicist's dream).And with Richard Mason's The Drowning People (after watching the recent profile of him on CNN) I asked this old question with more than my usual dose of scepticism.What surprised me, however, is that The Drowning People (as many others have thought before me) more than lives up to its hype. I found it a gracefully- written, beautifully constructed novel; and felt like its 70 year old narrator was speaking directly to me.Keep 'em coming, Mr. Mason!"
5,Well-written and intriguing.,I thought the confession in the beginning and the subsequent narrative made for a compeling story. I was guessing throughout the story what the specific reason for his action was.
5,A wonderful read!,"What a wonderful book! I have nothing but praise for this ambitious, absorbing, and intelligent mystery. Richard Mason is truly a gem! Between the lush prose and the intriguing social constructs examined in the book, I couldn't put it down. Also, it is such a rare treat to come across a mystery that respects the reader's intelligence, and that doesn't give away every detail of itself right away. Like one other reviewer has already commented, the ""who"" is answered immediately; it's the ""why"" that keeps you reading on!"
2,I'm drowning in boredom - is it finally over???,I am not a big fan of English film and perhaps that's the reason I didn't really like this book. It just kept going and going and going. I found so many areas extremely boring but I always (well almost) finish a book once I start. There was not enough story for the length of the book.
4,worth the wait,"This book was at times slow moving, and the detailed descriptions were often repetative and frustrating. Despite this, I could not stop reading it. The story was haunting, and worth the wait. The slow pace seemed to fit the main character's slow revelation of what had taken place. Although I did figure out the ending before the author gave it away, I don't feel it was too obvious."
3,Unusual but satisfying,"A suspenseful first novel from a young new voice, this book gripped me with the very first sentence. That Mason has an exceptional command of the English language is evident throughout the book. There are no glaring grammatical errors as are found so often in many of the more recent books I have read. I enjoyed the story but some of the musings and ramblings of James Ferrell became tedious after a time and I found myself skimming over some long passages describing his internal conflicts regarding right and wrong, love and hate, and good and evil. Still, the first person narrative was effective. It was an entertaining as well as thought-provoking story."
3,Impressive Debut,Richard Mason's first novel is certainly an impressive start to what should be a long and successful career. I don't like the term 'page turner' but I did find it hard to stop reading. This is not un-put-downable in the blockbuster sense...you just want to keep reading because the story is so damn good - even if it is a little contrived. The only real flaw is the occassional lapse into over writing in an effort to move the action along to the next important twist.
1,Tired and emotional,"This novel kicks off with the old chestnut (at least to moviegoers): why did Mr X kill his wife? It then delves into the past (which is meant to be the present) to tell us. What results is a strictly white-tie-and-tails melodrama - one that feels closer to the 1900s than the 1990s - of betrayal, jealousy, stolen kisses etc, among the Britsh upper classes. It might have been fun, but Mason adopts a ponderous, self-consciously 'poetic' style, attaching enormous weight and significance to every turn in the story. There's a lot of regret and moaning about the follies of youth, but zero spontaneity and very little worthwhile insight. Sorry, but this one was a major drag."
1,"He's got the talent, But......","So this kid is a good looking British with just 20 years behind his back, can he write? Not convincingly. For a 70 year old man, he faults in that. The story was stretched to the limit, how much more could you tell? Bantam is quite a fool I must say :)I would rather give this book 3 stars, but the current average of this book is too high, so I'd prefer to drag it down to its reasonable rating in my opinion."
1,"Pants, pants, pants","I must say that this 'haunting' novel really did haunt me for some time. Rushing out, as I did, to purchase this bargain novel (10) I soon came to realise that I had found a flop. Now I feel that I can never trust the marketing of books again; the hype surrounding this naive author was ridiculous. Not wishing to sound too vulgar, I realised this morning that I had run out of toilet paper and decided that I had a worthy substitute sitting on my shelf. I believe that Richard Mason can learn a lesson from this; I hope he could rebuild a worthy reputation of himself in the future, because the kid does have some talent."
2,"Too old, too tired","I picked this up on the recommendation of a glossy magazine. I expected something fresh, sharp and young. But this book reads like something from the 1920s. The old man narrator is ponderous and given to flights of 'profound' observation - and the story of love tangles among the aristocracy seemed very dated to me, and not convincing. There are some well-drawn moments and scenes, but not enough for this to be called satirical or a 'comment' on the set it describes. I was disappointed. Perhaps I should have known better than to take my literary recommendations from a glossy magazine!"
2,These sorts of things should be left in the drawer,"Poor Richard Mason. The talent that allows some of his very good writing and the perspicacity that generates amazing wisdom for one one so young, can also produce potential literary disasters. Very few first novels should be let out of the bottom left hand drawer of the battered wooden desk. One should read them every couple of years as a reminder of the necessity of time and time again. As for the results, sorry Kid but Scott Spencer and Ruth Rendell writing as Barbara Vine cornered this market years ago and not on a first time basis."
1,Beware...You are entering Dullsville,"Where was Richard Mason's editor? Asleep at the wheel, I would say. The paperback was 388 pages or so, and at least 200 of those could have been edited. We, the readers, would be far better for it. I've never read such a dull, boring, predictable, repetitious piece of fluff. I've no idea what the rave reviews on the cover were referring to...certainly not to this overrated first book. I will never pick up another novel by Richard Mason. Not if you paid me."
1,"Halfway through I gave up, should've done it sooner","Not the literate prose that so many reviewers have raved about, not at all realistic, and certainly not interesting! Also, what year is this taking place in? He's seventy, but his parents were teens in the '60's. Couldn't get a timeframe. Storyline? I'm sorry but the critics were amazed that this novel was written by one so young, but it's actually very clear after reading a few pages. Please do not compare this to Donna Tartt's novel ""A Secret History"". Now that is a classic."
3,Works as advertised,"Product arrived on time.It is about 2 feet long cord that plugs into the Sony Alpha with a button to activate the shutter. It allows for the halfway down effect that the actual shutter button performs. The Sony Alpha camera strap has a plastic gizmo to attach the cord to the strap for carrying around. Not sure I would do that.Satisfied. Will work out well for taking night shots where I dnt want to move the camera when I press the shutter button, now I use this remote."
3,Good but cheaper options are available,"Before you spend $$ for this remote, make sure that you really need it. It's good if you're using your tripod a lot and also if you work with slow shutter speeds. Doesn't make sense having it if it's not on a tripod.ALSO, after I bought this, I found that there's a third party (Opteka) remote for about 1/4th the price. If only I'd see that earlier, I'd have saved myself some money.This is indeed a good piece of equipment and is actually made by Sony so no complaints. But there's something which is functionally good enough (if not quite as pretty) and I being of a thrifty nature would go for that instead."
2,Consider the infrared remote controller instead,"I compared this product withSony Alpha RMT-DSLR1 Camera Remote (Black)for my new A550. I decided to go for the infrared remote control instead. The infrared remote can do everything the wired remote commander can do except one thing. If you want a shutter speed slower than 30 sec (bulb) buy the this product. If you don't require this function, buy the infrared remote controller instead. The infrared remote controller has the benefit that you can stand 10 meters in front of the camera and take a photo of yourself. There is also a 2 sec delay button, so you don't have to stand directing the remote when the photo is taken. Add to this that the remote is much cheaper and the choice is clear. There are also a bunch of playback buttons to be used when camera is attached to television set on the infrared remote controller, but I'm not using them"
4,Remotes are great,This product works great. My wife takes pictures of animals at dusk and with the remote she is able to let it be still. Really like this product. It would get 5 stars if the remote had a longer cord.
3,Only works with Waterman refills,"Excellent pen and color is a bright red and perfect for a holiday gift. Unfortunately it takes a special type of Waterman refill so most of the time I buy Parker pens to give friends or business contacts as gifts as the Parker pens use standard ""international"" refills people can find anywhere in the world or at their local stationary store in the USA. I understand the profit maximizing motivation of Waterman managers wanting to have a captive customer base for the refills just like HP, Epson, and canon with their inkjet printers, but when I have an option to go generic I generally will take it."
3,"OK, but ""While I Was Gone"" was much better...","I picked up this book because ""While I Was Gone"" was so interesting...but this book really falls flat. I thought parts were interesting, but mostly it seemed out of date. Maybe because it is 15 years old and women have progressed so much in those 15 years. I have never found myself compromising my ""passion"" for my children, but I am not Anna. If you are choosing between this and Sue Miller's latest work, please choose ""While I Was Gone"""
3,Was she really a good mother?,"Sue Miller's first work, The Good Mother, tells the sad tale of a mother who faces the possible loss of her toddler daughter, Molly, as a result of an inappropriate occasion between her boyfriend and daughter. Although it is nothing like While I Was Gone as far as a literary work goes, it was still captivating. I found myself sympathizing deeply with this mother, Anna, as she faces and overcomes the disappointments and heartbraches of a wrecked marriage, custody battles and personal struggles. There is no doubt that Miller has a gift for writing as well as a deep understanding of the state of human suffering."
1,Subtle Racial Undertones,"The story was interesting. Nevertheless, I was turned off by her continuous adoration of ""white skin"" while everything and everyone black or brown was given a negative connotation. It's a small aspect of the book, but it was enough to reveal the attitude of the author. I won't be purchasing anymore of her books."
1,Over-rated,"I didn't particularly like this book. I read it because it was mentioned on the cover ofHarvesting the Heart, though I have two other books by this author that made no impression on me (to be honest, I think it was by mistake that I even had more than other one, especially since I don't recall reading either!). On the surface, I can see why this can be seen as similar to Jodi Picoult's work - the family drama, the court case... but the characters (other than the little girl), were not very real or endearing. And while the ending was in depth - it still wasn't satisfying. Mostly, it felt like a book carrying a heavy-handed feminist slant and was barely masked in the plot. I wouldn't recommend this."
4,Tracy Petzke's Review,"I really did enjoy this book. I've read Sue Miller's family Pictures and also her short story collection, and this one is my favorite. I could really relate to the characters in the book and was convinced that despite what the courts told her, she was an excellent mother to her young daughter. I got a glimpse of just how difficult it would be to have a child and try to live a life on your own. I love how Sue Miller focuses on family life and struggles in all her books. They seem very down to earth and easy to relate to. Sue Miller really did pull me into this book from the very beginning."
3,Realistic for it's subject matter,"I just finished reading the book. The characters are developed well enough, but a lot of the book is pretty predictible. You know where the story is leading until near the end. The story goes how you would likely expect, other than the fact that it was actually written back in the mid 80's and things have changed since then. It might have had more impact back when it was written. There is a lot of the main charactor's family history in the book, which is interesting, but it never really does tie in much to where she is in her life. The book was ok reading, but not one I would highly recommend. I am about to read her book ""While I Was Gone"". We'll see if it is any better."
5,A Family Tragedy,This is a wonderful book. Miller's language is rich and evocative - - as intense as the emotions she evokes. It is a cross between Mark Helprin and Alice Hoffman.Anna is the protagonist and her passions is portrayed as realistically and all-consumingly as anything I've ever read. The only weak spot in the novel is the way that Miller treats the dissipation of Anna and Leo's relationship and the way Leo is portrayed as someone to pity and 'just a tad' removed from the mainstream. This part is written as though this fringe quality of his is the rationale or vantage point from which the tragedy can be viewed and understood. Anna's torment and tragedy is almost unbearable.This book's force and beauty are almost beyond description. It is a book to be savored and remembered for a very long time.
3,Very graphic sexual description's,"I have read the other reviews and find it odd that no one has mentioned the very graphic details of Anna and Leo's encounter's. I was very surprised by this because I was not expecting this book to be what I would consider soft porn. I point this out because I could see where this book could be very offensive to some readers.The story is good. The writing is well done. I would recommend this book highly. But, I would also mention that it really needs a XX rating too."
4,realistic stuff,"The Good Mother touched me. It is something that could easily happen to anyone. I know myself went through a separation with my husband when my daughter was very young, and I could see how easily this type of thing might happen. I was young though. It touched me. I like Sue Miller, This is not my favorite of hers, but it was a good read."
1,Unworthy,"It's beyond me how this could have spent 6 months on the NY Times best seller list (there went their credibility)! Rated R (for sexual context). The main character who has a deep motherly love for her child, yet engages herself with a worthless man just for some lustful sex. A complete waste of my time!"
3,Raw,"I thought the book was a little raw. The story was a good one, but somewhat obvious and disturbing. If all children were raised this way with the total lack of morality we would all be in trouble."
5,"Good Quality, Good PRICE, I feel good about the THX CERT, would never pay full price","Good Quality, Good PRICE, I feel good about the THX CERT, would never pay full price"
4,Excellent for kids and adults,I saw this movie on tv and I loved it. I think it is a great movie to watch with your kids because the woman and her two children never give up. This movie shows a young Helen Hunt in her first movie role and her talents show even at age nine.(i'm a fan of hers)
5,This book will elevate your life.,"You don't have to be a photographer to be dazzled by this book and the talents of this inspirational man. Buy this book to be amazed. Buy this book to be startled by its beauty and the vision of this man who is a national treasure. This is not a book to be placed on a cocktail table and forgotten. This is a book that must be used every day. You can never be ""too busy"" to not look at one page a day and marvel at the beauty that this world, nature, and this man can produce. Buy this book for someone who needs a dose of awe and wonder in his/her life."
5,paul delay,This is such a classic. We love Paul Delay's music so anything we buy or give that he created is a new favorite.
5,The best book about spiritual armour ever written!,"Rick Renner is a master teacher who knows how to permanently etch the Word of God into your heart and mind with powerful images and detailed understanding of Biblical text. After reading ""Dressed to Kill,"" I came away with no questions, no doubts, rather with a lot more confidence in God and the person I am in Christ. This book is a major component of my Christian book aresenal, and one I can't recommend highly enough. GET THE BOOK! You can't afford not to! I guarantee it will help you with ANY struggle you are facing and pre-prepare you to deal effectively with those yet to come"
5,incredible explaination of true Armor of God,If Rick Renner had a Bible of his accurate Greek explaination.. More Christians would understand The POWER in the word of God!!!
4,Some great information regarding prayer,"Rick Renner is extremely knowledgeable about his topic, and makes sure to get through to his perhaps less-educated readers. Parts are a bit pedantic, but it's definitely well worth reading. I recommend it to any serious student of the Word."
2,ho hum what,"Big Hype for forgettable contents, clearly written by novice person, excited about having spiritual armor this author clearly has no spiritual experiences, I was disapointed"
5,Faith Promoting,"I find the depth of this entire book inspiring. The research that went into preparation for this book is amazing. I have read the book several times and make it part of my permanent library. My own research prompts me to disagree only in the authors portrayal of JUDAS.The author condemns JUDAS for betrayal but overlooks PETER'S sin of denying the CHRIST. Let me refer to one scripture from the KJV BIBLE. N.T. book of Luke chapter 12: verses 8,9,10. To prove what many people overlook, look at St. John chapter 13: verse 27. JESUS commanded JUDAS go and betray Him. More references to prove that JUDAS has been forgiven, refering to his twelve disciples in Luke Chapter 22: verses 28,29,30.And Mathew chapter 19: verse 28. There are many more which I could quote, but these should get your interest."
1,"no personal witness by a so-called ""special witness"" just a tedious plagiarism","I was disappointed to note that the book is gleaned from and based upon the scholarly works of real theologians such as:Cuningham Geikie ""Life and works of Christ""Federick Farrar ""Life of Christ""Alfred EdersheimETCAs is clear and evident from the footnotes, endnotes, bibliography, Mr Talmage is simply an amalgamator and editor who has gleaned the basics from the above authors plus a few more, then written a concise biography on Christ and then contaminated such biography by injecting mormon dogma.Amazingly, Mr Talmage regards himself as a ""special witness"" of Christ himself!! and was sustained by his church as a ""prophet seer and revelator"" - however, as is clear from his book, from start to finish, Mr Talmage makes NO personal claim whatsoever to being a personal witness to Christ, and his book is entirely a scholarly analysis, based on the work done by other theologians of other denominations."
1,All Lies,"What I have issue with is how anyone can write a history of the life of Jesus when there is NOTHING written about this mythical figure by a single contemporary. All we have on the ""life"" of Jesus is in the Bible and those tales were written down decades, perhaps centuries, after his supposed life. How can one write down with any integrity a verbatum quote spoken at least decades before?Jesus may well be the most famous man to have never lived. I encourage you to read both sides of the debate as I have and view the evidence with an open mind and a fearless spirit. Your own Bible instructs you to seek the truth in all you do."
5,The only thing I would improve....,The only think I would improve is linking the crossreferences to the scriptures. But you can not beat the price.
5,Everyone should read this,We bought this for our missionary's Kindle. It's an excellent book and a good resource for those studying and teaching the gospel.
4,Excellent book regardless of your faith,"I have read this book before adn wanted to read it again. It offers some great insight into the personal side of our lord Jesus Christ. WHile the book was written my James Talmadge, a memember of the Mormon Church it is still an excellent read for persons of any denomination"
5,A Great Contribution,"Scripture based rather than opinion based, scholarly. In addition, one gets the feeling that not only does this man know the scriptures, he also knows the Author."
5,Inspiring,Learning more of Christ enables a person to grow closer to and become more Christ like... a worthy goal wherever you are in your walk of life.
5,Amazing!!!!!,This is by far the best book ever written. I've read it 3 or four times already. This is a book for people that are interested in the Biblical Jesus.
1,Not pleased with this item.,"There seemd to be no end to the technical problems when I ordered this product. It would not even play at ALL past the first few minutes. Plus, I did not receive the CORRECT volume that I ordered. I wanted to begin with number one and if I liked it I would move on to the others in the series. I actually GOT the second one. It is the ONLY item I think I have ever had to return to Amazon."
