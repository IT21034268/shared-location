5,Love John Hiatt,This was a good old set of his songs. He is under appreciated definitely.Slow Turning is probably my favorite on this cd but Tennessee Plates is right up there along with Somewhere Other than Now.I am very much enjoying this!
2,easily breakable,"The press makes a great cup of coffee, but the damn beaker will break if you breathe on it wrong. I have beer glasses that have dropped 3 feet onto a tile floor without even chipping. Why can't Bodum use some of this technology?"
5,Yay!!,"Arrived super fast, I will have to stop breaking them but the price was great and I got over it as it arrived so fast!!"
4,A little homework will pay off at Amazon,"A fresh cup of gourmet coffee(coarsely ground), prepared in my French Press is a daily luxury I allow myself. However, even the most careful user finds soapy hands and a small tap on the sink, will lead to a cracked beaker, and you're out of business. Getting replacements locally are rare, and VERY pricey($25+). I lucked out and found a merchant at Amazon where I bought two (2), satisfied the $25 free shipping requirements, and within a week I was back in business, with a spare, for under $30. S-a-w-e-e-e-t!!!"
1,Wrong product,This replacement beaker does not work with a locking lid french press even though it says compatible with all Bodum models.
2,Didn't fit frame,"I made sure to order the right volume replacement beaker for the frame of my Bodum press, but it proved to be too small for the frame and a bit too narrow for the plunger (it could be forced through, but scraped the inside of the beaker). The frame is a bit adjustable but tightening it down didn't suffice, the beaker slid out and broke while I was pouring from it just 2 days after it finally arrived. Tragic."
2,12 CUP FRENCH PRESS REPLACEMENT BEAKER,"THIS PRODUCT WAS EXACTLY THE RIGHT SIZE TO REPAIR MY OLD FRENCH PRESS COFFEE POT. IN SPITE OF OTHER REVIEWS, IT DOES NOT SEEM OVERLY FRAGILE. ACTUALLY THIS REVIEW IS NOT FOR THE 34 OUNCE REPLACEMENT BEAKER. WHICH I ORDERED BY MISTAKE, BUT FOR THE 12 CUP REPLACEMENT I ENDED UP BUYING"
4,"Bodum's Win, Win","It's a win for Bodum in the design and function of their French Press. I've been using one (make that several ) for a number of years now... works great. As for the other 'win'? Bodum's received additional funds from yours truly as their beakers are incredibly fragile and as mentioned by several loyal customers, they break very easily. If it weren't for the fact that my cups o' coffee made with freshly roasted beans go down so well after using the press, I'd most certainly find other means for brewing a cup. Bottom line: great coffee, breaks too easily... more revenue for Bodum!-Addicted"
5,Buying a replacement beaker...get 2,"If you are buying this, you've most likely already broken the original beaker that came with your Bodum coffee press. So do yourself a favor and buy 2 and get the free shipping. If you've broken it once, chances are you'll probably break it again. The coffee press is great, and it's less expensive to replace the beaker than buy a whole new setup."
2,Too Easily Broken,"I confess that I love my Bodum coffee press. But the beaker just breaks way too easily. Today, I was using a brand new one, and was stirring, contrary to the instructions, with a metal spoon. It was just a short handled tea spoon. I clicked the side of the beaker, and a quarter-sized piece of the glass, at the bottom, just seemed to pop out!Order these in pairs, and always have an extra or two on standby. And use a wooden or plastic spoon. The manufacturer should do the right thing and make a more substantial beaker."
1,Over priced coffee beaker,"This product came in in a timely manner and without damage but turns out I could have got the very same item for $7.99 instead of $19.99. Shame on you for outrages mark up, shame on me for not comparing prices before purchase. Buyer beware!"
1,"Cheap, thinner glass? 2 broken carafes in 5 mos","I'm done with glass beakers. My original Bodum beaker lasted a long, long time but the 2 most recent replacements have cracked too easily--and I am very careful with them. Perhaps the glass is thinner on the new replacements. I should have followed my gut and bought the one from Planetary Design."
4,We love this product because we love our coffee,"SInce we manage to ding these on the sink, we purchase them in 3's. Love having the ability to replace the carafe as opposed to an entire system."
2,Fragile or what!!!!,I love these things but the glass beaker is far too fragile.It seems like the slightest bump causes the glass to crack or completely break.
3,replacement glass,it's bloody expensive for just the silly glass.Go to Smart and Final for the same brand and get the whole thing for under the same cost!!!
2,Easily Broken,"I got the replacement due to breakage of the original. The replace soon broke, too.I gave up. Didn't want to go to the plastic model."
4,Replacement,"When washing my other beaker I broke it. At first I didn't think that this one fit, but it did and has been great. I have been putting it in the dishwasher more since I have slippery hands."
2,Too fragile,"When I ordered this replacment I decided to order an ""unbreakable"" french press. It was cheaper than the Bodum french press and works just as well."
3,Nice to have a replacement. Too Bad you will need quite a few of them,"Its nice to get a replacement for the Bodum carafe, however, they seem to be very fragile and break very easily in the sink. I've broken 2 in the past 6 months. I think I will buy a completely new french press from a different brand if this one breaks as well!"
4,GOT TO HAVE IT!,"""CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT AS MY BODUM WILL NOT PRODUCE-----I order them two (2) at a time as they are fragile but, ""YOU GOT TO HAVE THEM"" as Ionly drink one coffee a day and insist it must be fresh and my Bodum does exactlythat! If it breaks I am prepared. GOT TO HAVE IT!!"
4,Excellent Beaker,The shipping was fast and the Bodum beaker works great! I bought it as a replacement for one that accidentally was broken. I was glad to find out that I did not have to buy everything again.
3,Should have gotten a new press...,"Item work and it's fine, but despite several attempts it didn't come back together quite right and looks and feels a little funny. Should have paid the extra money to get a new one."
4,Good replacement-in-kind though with some minor details left out,"My original Bodum french press beaker had a crack and was thrown away. I'm thrilled to see Bodum selling just the beaker itself or it'd have been a waste to discard all the rest of the perfectly fine french press components. This beaker fits well, not surprising given that it's made by the same manufacturer. It did seem to have a little tighter fit than my old beaker and needed a little bit of force to install and remove it, not a big deal.I did remove a star because the beaker did not have the line markings that indicate the water level needed for various coffee portions being brewed. The original beak did have it. It would have been nice to not have to eyeball the beaker each time.Overall, great replacement item should one's 34"" old french press' beaker is not longer useable."
1,buy the french press at IKEA and use that glass,The IKEA french press is $12.99 and the glass beaker fits into the Bodum perfectly! That is all...
1,Glass Breaks Too Easily,"DO NOT BUY ANY BODUM COFFEE OR TEA PRESS THAT CONTAINS GLASS. BODUM USES A SPECIAL GLASS THAT IS EXTRAORDINARILY FRAGILE AND BREAKS FOR NO APPARENT REASON.I love Bodum Coffee Presses. But I would NEVER recommend anyone buy one with a glass beaker. You will need to replace the beaker frequently, since the special glass Bodum uses is extremely fragile, and breaks repeatedly for no apparent reason at all. I replaced four beakers, two glass tea presses, and several beakers from milk frothers in short order before giving up. Make no mistake, you do not have to bang the glass against anything for it to break. It simply cracks spontaneously for no apparent reasonBodum has come out with some presses with a LEXAN clear plastic beaker.These do not break. I assume they came out with the LEXAN product because of problems with the glass. Be warned."
1,beware; not all cups are the same.,"Wish I had taken the time to read the other customer reviews. Boy was I surprised when my ""4 cup"" Bodum French press carafe arrived as a dinky 2 cup, but technically it's a ""3 cup"". HA! I HAD TO REORDER--the really annoying thing is, I could have purchased a new one locally AND PAID LESS for the replacement after incurring 2 shipping fees+return shipping fee. So much for saving a few bucks. Lesson learned. A ""cup"" is not always a ""cup""."
4,Good product,"I was very upset when my last beaker broke after serving my family for many years, daily. This product arrived quikly and was exactly what i expected. sizes were a little confusing but considering i lived in Germany for a few years i got it figured out. The text thats printed all over the beaker is not quite what i expected though since the original had no markings on it, not quite as classy looking at something with words all over, but you can twist it in the metal holder to hide most of it.. Thanks"
4,Would be 5,This would be a 5 star review exept the beaker breakes too easily. This is my 4th beaker in 5 years.
2,Might require a product recall,"First of all, I saw this entire show on PBS - it is hilarious! BUT, the DVD I received was faulty. Although printed with ""The Legendary Victor Borge"" on the disc itself, the actual video on the disc was for ""Jim Rohn Weekend Leadership Event"" - no sign of the legendary Mr. Borge.Even though this is a great show that fans will love, I felt it was necessary to warn other customers that the product might be faulty.:("
4,More than good enough,"This ""opera"" is really an oratorio. The characters do no more than stand around and sing, even the famous hair cutting is done off-stage. Here the two name characters are American--Verrett is at the top of her form and sings all of Dalila's music sensuously and with wonderful tone. This was long before Cassily was dumb enough to undertake Tannhauser for the Met, and he too sounds very good. If, in the end, this is not a totally satisfying performance, it is lacking because the opera itself is static and offers only fleeting moments of real satisfaction. Worth having for Verrett and Cassily singing so well, but my regret is that M. San-Saens didn't rework the whole thing and try to juice this opera up a little."
4,Wonderful,"Another magnificent and suspenseful book by vonnegut,.... Learn Bokononism, face the lies... Enjoy..."
4,Very entertaining!,"Not Vonnegut's best, but because he is so brilliant, the book is brilliant nonetheless. I recommend it as a starting novel for people who have not read any of his books."
3,It was OK,"The novel was actually, a bit of a disappointment. From the praise, and encouragement, I recived from my AP Language teacher I assumed it would be fantastic. The novel itself was very sporadic and difficult to follow. I understand that this is Vonnegut's style of writing, but it did not appeal to me. On any normal occasion I would have given the book a two. However, it did have an interesting plot. Having an apocalyptic theme and the technology that was introdced made it more compelling. In my opinion, this story gets a three to three in a half as a rating. If you enjoy books that require a bit more thought then normal, then I highly recommend the novel. If, however, you enjoy page turners that need little to no thought process to understand the plot, I would not recommend it. PMC"
3,cat's cradle,"In Cat's Cradle, John goes around trying to get facts for his book on the Hiroshima bomb. Vonnegut incorporates completely different things together and never stops striking your interest at the perfect time. The plot doesn't quite make sense, though it's fun to read. I recommend this book to teenagers and younger ages."
3,"Interesting, but What?","This book wasn't bad, but it seemed a bit lacking. I don't know. Call me a Philistine, but it didn't really have much in the neighborhood of character development. Or conflict. Or most of the elements of a story, for that matter.Granted, it was an entertaining read, and I can see a smile on Vonnegut's face upon reading this. He would probably look at me and say, ""Cat's Cradle."" Was that the point? Was I supposed to come out of it with a nihilistic outlook? The story was short, simple, and it lacked depth. I found it lacking.Read it if you like, or don't. I don't see anything particularly compelling about it, and I am enjoying my new book much more.Harkius"
2,Yawn!,The end of the world...Yawn! Suffice it to say that I moved through the pages of this book very slowly.
4,A must for Vonnegut fans,An easy read that led to Vonnegut's Anthropology B.A. The story evokes questions regarding mankind's ignorance when faced with scientific achievement.
5,Vonnigut's funniest and most intelligent book,"I first read Cat's Cradle on trip through Illinois heading for Chicago. I started laughing out loud almost immediately and the others in the car had to hear the 'funny part'. Soon I was reading the whole book out loud and all of us were laughing our heads off constantly. This remains for me the best example of Vonnegut's use of black humor to make a serious point. The characters and plot line are as original as anything he ever wrote and the humor is still as fresh as ever. This is wonderful, hard edged writing, a kind of modern day Jonathan Swift tale that mingles science, religion, philosophy, political upheaval and human nature at its most extreme. The book keeps us laughing and leaves us thinking."
4,Enjoyable read,My first Vonnegut. What a great writer. I recommend this to anyone who appreciates a book with good old fashioned quality sarcasm.
4,Interesting take,Easy to read short story reviewing religion and society. A lot of things to consider through easily digestible format. I enjoyed it.
4,Ice-nine skating,"This wacky tale of a journalist who witnesses the end of the world is a wonderful satire filled with memorable imagery and witticisms. Since this is the first Vonnegut book I've read, I don't know if it's his best, but I certainly think it's a fascinating read. The use of a cat's cradle string-game as a metaphor for various ideas and things is quite astute and sparklingly new, even though the book is from 1963. This book is definitely for anyone interested in zany literature that challenges the status quo, of any sort."
5,powerful~dark comedy that is uncannily real,"I just finished Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle. This is my first Vonnegut book and I'm most definitely a fan now. He has the incredible ability to interweave serious issues into a humorous satire. There were times I laughed out loud, and then I wondered why I did. He forces one to search deeper and to question our beliefs and the consequences of science, religion, capitalism~everything. The books of Bokonon were some of my absolute favorites, even though it was a ridiculous religion; it certainly contained many roots of truth. It is a very very fast read, I didn't want to put it down. However, you wanted to savor every word and think about every chapter. DO READ IT!"
5,The best and worst of Vonnegut ...,"Love this book and you say its a thrill ride of an apocolyptic adventure. Hate it, and its just another cheeky Sci-Fi farce. There is a lot of faux scientific gobbledygook to cut through, but there is also fine characters and funny scenes. Across the spectrum of his work, Vonnegut's glory comes in the stories he weaves from fantastic situations. He uses science fiction without being a Sci-Fi writer the same way Flaubert used romance but was not a writer of romantic novels. Vonnegut may not be the scholar's darling now, but he will be after his death. He is a true American stylist in the tradition of Twain and Nabakov. Cat's Cradle is among his best books. It is in the very American tradition of combining wit and innovative style with a solid storytelling."
4,Facinating and Funny as always,"I very much enjoyed this Vonnegut book, although probably not quite as much as the other two that I've read, Breakfast of Champions and Slaughterhouse Five. Nevertheless, this book was witty throughout, and at the same time inspired my thoughts on the fragilty of life, the meaning of fate, and our ""abuse"" of science and the power it gives us (and what it can take away from us!)A great Vonnegut book, in my opinion, and a must read for any fan."
4,A review,"Kurt Vonneugts Cat's Cradle is carried along by a group of captivating characters, which include a scientist, Dr. Hoenikker, and his 3 awkward children. A religious man, sugar giants, and a beautiful woman are all found on San Lorenzo. These characters carry the reader from Ilium in the Midwestern United States, to the small island of San Lorenzo in the Caribbean, to the ultimate destruction of the world using a new, mysterious substance. The symbolism portrayed makes this a wonderful book that will absorb a reader completely. This book is recommended to anyone 15 and older."
5,Bokonon Reigns Above All,"I have just finished reading Cat's Cradle for the second time. I found it un-controllably witty, funny and highly entertaining. The religion based on lies is ingenious. Vonnegut's satire is thought provoking. He really makes you think, about religion, and life, and how it will all end."
4,One of Vonnegut's most popular is also most overrated,"Far be it from me to imply that ""Cat's Cradle"" is not a good time. But for some reason it has come to sit in Vonnegut's pantheon next to ""Slaughterhouse 5"" and ""Welcome to the Monkey House."" And again, it's not that it doesn't work; the odd little tale of island romance in the midst of revolution and the ultimate freezing element, ice-9 has plenty of terrific moments. But ultimately, the book feels cold and clammy; where elsewhere Vonnegut contrasts the sad and the funny here he chooses to club you with pathos and neglect to explain much of anything. Overall, a good read, but check out ""Sirens of Titan"" or most of his other early novels before shipwrecking here"
5,One of the best books I've read.,"This is one of those great books that I recall reading when I was younger that made reading fun. I've read it several times over the years and still enjoy it very much. Vonengut's voice and pacing is impeccable. A book I've read recently, The Spear of Golgotha by Richard Greenwald makes reading fun too- its too bad that it is so difficult to find"
2,Cat's Cradle,"Cat's Cradle has little to offer but Kurt Vonnegut's very pessimistic assessment of religion, politics, and love. The characters are just ""types,"" and so incompletely sketched that we can't care what happens to any of them. The plot brings together an assortment of these characters - for no apparent reason at all - to an island for a doomsday scenario. After the scenario plays out, we receive from Vonnegut the valuable intelligence that all of mankind's effort is meaningless and absurd, and that the best we can hope for is a good laugh at the joke that God has played on us. Most readers will have no reason to trouble with this inconsequential work."
1,Cat's Cradle,We ordered this product more than 30 days ago and it still has not arrived. I read it 40 years ago and remember it was pretty good. Guess I'll never know if I still like it. Thanks for nothing.
1,cat cradle,horrible i feel asleep every time i guess this wasent my kind of story mabye as i get older but not now im only 14 and me being a girl i dont like this topic
1,"Depressing, like he always is",This guy is just so horribly depressing. I thought he was a humanist but he's just obsessed with the abyss. Sad.
1,"No plot, went nowhere.","Vonnegut tried to suck you in with a boring main character that had no substance at all. Then brought in mutated family members of an infamous man, the man who made the H bomb. Vonnegut had no other way of ending the book except for killing off everybody in the world. If I could give negitive stars I would. Boring- don't read it."
1,As bad as it gets,"This book is a total disappointment. One of the worst books I have ever read. His ""humor"" is on idiotic level and the book in general is schizophrenic. Only thing Vonnegut achieved is to annoy me; this is the first book in my life that I threw into the garbage."
2,Good Book,"I read this book for my literature class. I prefer Slaughterhouse 5. However, this is also interesting and unique. Science fiction has never been my favorite."
5,A very good book!,"I wanted to kill myself after reading this book. Kurt laughed laugh, pissed on love, and destroyed the nerves in my mind. I absolutely like this book. If you love riding a roller coaster, you'll love this book even more."
3,One of the most overrated books I have ever read!,Actually the three stars I am giving it are in my opinion a gift. I am assuming it is supposed to be satire but is too outlandish to take seriously and not funny enough or outrageous enough to be good satire. Overall it was mildly amusing but I was expecting much more based on all the great reviews.It is too lightweight to be put in the category of great books it is rated alongside!
2,"Vonnegut's ""Cat's Cradle"" less than impressive.","""Cat's Cradle"" is my first Vonnegut read. Considering his Nobel prize for literature, I was disappointed. Cat's Cradle creates a handful of new words; bokonon, boko-maru, wampeter, and etc. The apparent purpose of this tome is to poke fun at religion in general, in a very gentle and inconsequential way.Generally, I was bored through the bulk of the story, with only the slightest uptick in the way Vonnegut tied up loose ends together at the conclusion.My next Vonnegut read will be ""Slaughter House Five"". If what little I've read about that story prove to be even half accurate, it should prove to be a better reading investment.Paul"
2,Dr Strangelove x 10,"Ive read through Cat's Cradle twice and I'm convinced that Mr Vonnegut was either insane or is good at convincing the reader that he is. The characters in the story are certifiable. And the leadup to the climax is a trip through the rediculous and surreal. That may very well was his intention, however the result is a book this is every much jarring to try and get through."
2,Cat's Cradle,"I wanted to read some more of Kurt Vonnegut. I was disappounted with this book and never finished it. The book did arrive in good shape and on time. It semed like a loose story with some of his comments about life, but witout much of a plot."
2,V's High School Effort?,"I was begged to read Vonnegut. Bland mysticism; dozens of convenient chance meetings, storylines which drop off the face of the earth; this was cheep! Please don't compare to Heller."
4,ENDING IT ALL,"Obvious satire on all the ridiculous happy endings sewn onto stories but why else throw in the towel on mankind? One wonders if the story might be a justification for suicide. One supposes that Vonnegut, like his character, little Newt, was disappointed that in making a Cat's Cradle that there really is no cat and no cradle-that there is really nothing supporting the religious tripe that seem to keep people rolling down the track. He certainly put the ""dys"" in utopia here. I doubt if a more poignant tale of futility and hopelessness could be penned.Although his memorable characters are nicely drawn-they are all too easily erased by the final page. Why struggle through so many pages of words only to reach the same blank page one started with? Looking for virtue in the tale one can say that it was short and abrupt. The suffering doesn't last that long. Everyone would prefer an instant and painless end to their life."
2,Builds fascinating layers and then collapses,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first 90% of this book. But then it was if if Vonnegut said, ""Well, better end this now"" and slapped on a contrived, simplistic, and extremely unsatisfying ending."
5,Too short,"If the worst thing you can say about a book is that you wish it was longer, then, hey, that's not too bad, right?I mean, I can recognize wonderful writing more than I can produce it so I won't write much here. But the book is good. Buy it. You won't be sorry."
5,Hy-o-ook-kuh!,"Put this review down at once, it is nothing but foma! You there, sitting in your granfallons, thinking you know your karass, but really living out a wrang-wrang. Shame on you! If you want to know your zah-mah-ki-bo, read this book. But never, never drink a cold, refreshing drink poured gingerly over a nice tall glass of ice-nine. If you do, we will all be killed, and not even the pleasures of boko-maru will help ease our sufferings!"
2,Not what I had hoped,"Maybe I did not read the fine print, but I was disappointed in the quality of this book. It looks like a very high quality fake. My primary gripe is with the cover. I have owned this book in softcover and the hardcover looks like someone scanned the softcover and printed it in their back room. The text looks fine and if you are just looking to read the book, nothing more, I am sure it is fine. If that was what I wanted though I would have paid 5 bucks for a softcover. I was looking for something a bit more collectible. Something that would look nice on my bookshelf."
3,Cat's Craddle,"Cat's Craddle is a story about a reporter chasing after the family a Mr. Hoenikker, one of the scientists behind the creation of the atomic bomb. I read this book while taking AP US History and could make many connections which helped make the book interesting. There were some parts in the book that seemed to drag on while others were quick reads. At many point I told myself that I was going to stop reading but then an interesting part came and I could not put it down. The book does jump around a lot which at times make things difficult to follow. Although it does not jump around as much as Slaughterhouse Five there is a strange fluidity that is created that puts a damper on the usual Vonnegut books. It is almost to fluid to make the book interesting."
5,"Started reading in the morning, and by afternoon, I was done","Having never read any Vonnegut before (but hearing good things about him from my sister), I was unsure what to expect. I still don't know that I could aptly describe what I read; however, suffice to say, I enjoyed it! Part sci-fi, part philosphy, part mystery, and part general confusion, Cat's Cradle kept me hooked from beginning to end!"
3,Interesting,"Before Cat's Cradle, I had read Slaughterhouse Five and Breakfast of Champions, both of which had a more humorous tone to them, so when I bought this, I thought it was going to be more of the same. In that sense, I was disappointed with the book, since it turned out to have a mostly serious tone to it.Cat's Cradle, in my experience, is Vonnegut's most lauded novel, but I did not enjoy it as much as the other two I've read. It seemed like the story never moved--like every major plot point was just the precursor to something that never happened. It felt like just the opening chapters to a much longer novel.However, with all that said, it is very readable. Any fan of Vonnegut will love this book. Perhaps my assumptions about the book soured the experience for me (and for this reason I will eventually reread it), but in any case, I'd recommend it to any fans of literature."
5,Cat's Cradle,This is the first novel that I have written by Vonnegut and I absolutely love the story line. The anticipation never leaves the reader as to what will happen next.
4,"funny and thought-provoking, but a bit disappointing","Clever, humorous, satirical tale about the end of the world and the bumbling characters (including the three children of a mad scientist) in a South American dictatorship that cause it to come into being through turning all the world's water into ice. Philosophical and psychological, incredibly insightful into mankind's existence. Grade: B+"
5,On the brink of insanity...,"Perhaps Vonnegut's masterwork...although many would argue for Slaughterhouse. This appears to be the start of Kurt's insane phase which seems to span from Cat's Cradle all the way until Galapagos, give or take. Where this books tops many of his 'insane era' novels is it is more a mesh of his early, 'money-making' novels where he tried to follow more traditional writing guidelines (i.e. Mother Night, Player Piano). Again, many will disagree, but due to Cat's Cradle combining Vonnegut's insanity and early Orwellian/Huxlian style this book is ultimate read to truly taste Kurt's entire pallate (of course, ignoring the later 'Bitter, Old Man' phase [Bluebeard, Timequake]).For those looking to sample the taste of a brilliant, raving lunatic, which is Kurt Vonnegut, Cat's Cradle is the true paterfamilias, not Slaughterhouse."
5,"If perfection can be attained in 191 pages, this is it!!","I was listening to a friend of mine talk with our Language teacher one day about Kurt Vonnegut. From all I heard before, he was a sick, psychopath who couldn't write. On advice from my friend and teacher, I went out and bought Cat's Cradle. This book was terrific! It's Absolut Vonnegut! 120-Proof, people! My only criticism is it was too short! When reading it the first time, I kept imagining that it would be terrible, but by the end I thought it was just what I needed to get over a terrible book I had just read for school, The Egypt Game. There is NO reason NOT to buy this masterpice of modern literature! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT!"
5,Best book in the world,"Kurt Vonnegut was the most brilliant mind alive at the turn of the century. It is an utter shame that he died recently, but so it goes. In my opinion, this is his finest work. He satorically questions religion, war and the nature of man all in one hillarious masterpeice. He is the Mark Twain of the 1900's. I recomend EVERYONE read this novel."
4,Hold on for an Insane Ride!!!,"Okay, I would like to give it 5-stars! What was I thinking, I can't change it now?!?! A truly entertaining, and somewhat frightening book. I don't like to write long reviews, so I'll get right to it. If you enjoyed Slaughterhouse-Five, you'll most certainly enjoy this novel. Cat's Cradle is more accessible, and not as outrageous as Slaughterhouse (which I enjoyed a little more). What can be said about Vonnegut that hasn't already been said. He was ahead of his time in thumbing his nose at the ""powers-that-be"". Do yourself a favor and read this book........NOW!"
5,"If you wonder about life and the world and if there is anything good to read, read this!","I frankly hold this one book as the perfect example of fiction writing at its best. Intelligent, creative, wry, funny, brilliant. Read it! If you don't have at least a slightly twisted sense of humor, don't bother reading it."
1,Heavy on Expectation...Low on Delivery,"""el Stinko Award"" Pointless really. Vonnegut should have taken some ice-nine before he wrote it."
1,Kurt Vonnegut can't write his way out of a paper bag...,"Exceedingly boring, much too long threads of useless information to the reader. Humor??? Where? If I laughed or giggled once every forty five pages or so, it was muffled by the yawn that soon followed. And does this man love the name ""Pefko"" so much that he did not realize that we would find it in yet another tediously boring rambling of his.. namely, "" Breakfast of Champions""? I have far better things to do with my time than to wait for this old man to get a sense of humor that he can put down on paper. If you would like to laugh, read ""The Catcher In The Rye""... J.D. Salinger. A man with a sense of humor need not try so hard that he completely misses the point, Mr. Vonnegut."
1,Simply awful.,"Cat's Cradle is the worst book I have ever read. It's a pointless, plotless book, and should not be considered as any sort of literary achievement. This book is a waste of time, and I do not recommend it to anyone."
1,Stunningly bad,"This book is absolutely horrible. Seriously, it's hideous. I can't stand to have this book in my house. I buried it along with my dead cat (meow) (that's an inside joke for you three CC fans out there)."
1,Not As Good as Star Wars,"This is a decent sci-fi escape, but nowhere near as good an escape as Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, or Star Wars: A New Hope. This isn't very challenging, and you may feel compelled to read it because of the almost too simple story, and easy going language. This is basically a book about a mad scientist who tries to take over the world by freezing it over with a substance called Ice-Nine, and at the end he succeeds because of his children's greed to control it. Again, not very complex or deep, a basic fable, but still entertaining. But as entertaining as Star Wars? NO. I recommend renting the star war movies or getting the star war books, especially the ones with Jabba the Hut. Cat's Cradle has no point or meaning to it, unlike Lucas's prophetic, amazing vision. Vonnegut is funny, but not very intelligent."
3,Could Have Been Better,"I guess it's considered a modern classic by some, but it seemed kind of lazily written to me. Full of intriguing ideas and well-drawn characters, the book starts out strong enough. Once the action reaches San Lorenzo and begins to build toward its apocalyptic climax, however, it gradually becomes less and less coherent. While the story ends with the ultimate bang, it sort of whimpers its way there -- Maybe it's some sort of literary device that I just didn't get -- And is it just me, or does Vonnegut's slightly self-righteous cynicism, doubtless refreshing in the early 1960's when the book was published, now seem just a little tired? The Vonnegut true believers would probably call this so much ""foma,"" but, in my opinion, if you're looking for one of the Great Man's books to read, stick withSlaughterhouse-Five"
3,this is it?,"I don't normally read contemporary fiction, except for Don Delillo, but I figured I would read Vonnegut because I think I confused him with Updike and because there was a Graham Greene blurb on the back. In any case, Vonnegut's black humour is mixed with a little too much knowing misanthropy for my taste. There are no sympathetic figures in the novel, which is roughly based on Shakespeare's Tempest, or at least set on the same island, San Lorenzo, but I could be mistaken. Official ceremonies, scientists, Indiana, and ambassadors all get the superior treatment from our narrator, Noah. The only sympathetic figure may be the scientist who built the bomb, but of course his childlike scientific play will ultimately destroy the world one way or another. Cat's Cradle would be a much better movie than novel, but only if it starred OJ Simpson and was turned into a slapstick comedy, because otherwise the black humour is just humourless misanthropy and the fantasy a tired device."
5,fanstic read,Vonnegut's style speaks to me. Cat's Cradle I've read several times over the past 10 years- and each time I enjoy it more.
3,Terrible Kindle edition from RosettaBooks,"The novel is great, but the terrible formatting of the RosettaBooks edition makes it almost unreadable. Quotation marks are misplaced with the wrong sentences, spacing is incorrect, and so on. I e-mailed them about the problems but got no reply."
5,Positivist Humor,"This book is full of whimsical humor. It's one of the few books that made me laugh out loud. Ironically, it's also incredibly pessimistic. Humanity is doomed by its own depraved nature to a farcical apocalypse. For Vonnegut, the main culprits are scientists who show no concern for the destructive applications of their inventions. Their scientific method is the only road to knowledge but (more pessimism) cannot yield moral knowledge or wisdom. Nothing can, including religion, which is 'all lies'."
2,Could have skipped it and read something else,"While I perhaps understood the overall point of the novel (i.e. that science may be truth but it can and will destroy man; whereas, a system of bliefs such as Bokonism allows man to live in harmony even if this peace and harmony is built on harmless untruths), I think Vonnegut could have done a better job at telling the story. The story ""bounced around"" a bit too much for me and as a reader, I did not know what to focus on, and after a while, did not care. Unlike Slaughterhouse Five, I did not find this book at all funny (was it supposed to be?) although I suspect that Vonnegut intended the reader to take humor in the medical condition known as midgetism. (FAIL!) I've read worse books, to be sure; nevetheless, I could have left this one on my shelf."
4,I enjoyed this much,"This was as brilliantly written, wryly satirical, poignant, ironic, fun and captivating as Vonnegut has ever been. That being said, I did have a few problems with this - one of the core lessons that it teaches is one of pointlessness, and that gets applied somewhat to aspects within the plot line; certain events take place that could be seen as deus ex machinas, but at times some of them are pointed out, how they are unexplained, and their explanations dismissed as unnecessary. It can come off as either smart, funny and very honest, or as somewhat lazy. I didn't feel like I gained as much from this as I did Slaughterhouse-Five, but that's not to say that I didn't gain anything at all - on the contrary, I found it to be very enriching, in the most ironic way possible. For social commentary and philosophical irony blended with fantastic storytelling and captivating, rich narrative, look no further than Vonnegut."
3,Bizarre,"I enjoy post apocalyptic novels by a variety of authors, thus Cat's Cradle was recommended to me. I had heard Vonnegut wrote strange stuff and this being the first novel I have read of his, I have to agree. Bizarre.This is written in first person by a survivor in a world that ended quite strangely, almost by the author's own hand. Brief chapters describe the survivor's pre-apocalyptic encounters with folks he is interviewing for facts for a biography he is preparing to write. Little seems to actually happen until the last few short chapters when everything goes south in a hurry and in a big way.The only reason I kept reading this book was because it was so odd I couldn't think of what possibly might happen next..."
5,great book,"This book is amazing, it's really easy to read, very difficult to put down, and it still manages to convey great meaning, probably Kurt Vonnegut's best book, next to The Sirens of Titan"
5,Vonnegut is nothing short of amazing,"My fifth Kurt Vonnegut novel in two weeks now, i began with Breakfast of Champions and have not been able to put down his books since, another truly great novel for fans of the author, and for newcomers alike"
3,"A funny quick read, but not as much depth","Cat's Cradle is the story of a reporter chasing down the family and friends of a one of the ""fathers"" of the nuclear bomb. The story takes him to a impoverished remote island that has developed its own religion that everyone practices but no one admits to.Vonnegut has a hilarious narrative style as always and goes into the fantastic and absurd by the last half of the novel. I would recommend this book for anyone looking for a quick read (especially on an airplane, since some of the best parts take place in the friendly skies). Though it isn't his best, Vonnegut doesn't provide the social commentary that something likeGod Bless You, Mr. Rosewater."
4,"""How the Consumer Society Came to Be""","This is probably Belloc's most famous piece of social commentary. Published in 1912, it foretold thegradual merger of capitalism and socialism to form what we today call the ""consumer society.""Belloc traces Western economic development from Roman times. He argues that the West had justshed the last vestiges of feudal slavery in favor of an independent yeomanry by the late Middle Ageswhen the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century turned all this around, and resulted in thepolarization of wealth that has continued to this day. His thesis is that capitalism, left to itself, isinherently unstable and must rely on state intervention. Ultimately, however, the large corporationsbenefit from moderate socialism. The mass of working people are reduced to servile wage earningconditions -- achieving basic material comfort, but no meaningful economic freedom -- being kept inline by the bureaucrats to the benefit of big business."
3,a VERY schoalr approach to the samurai,"I am presently translating the book into Hungarian so have to go into every detail of it. I feel the choice of topic is quite good, at last a book which does not only focus on Zen Buddhism but also gives information about other important factors of the religious lives of the bushi. However, the author does not seem to have organised her work very well, repetitions, inconsistencies are a characteristic feature of the book. After all, I recommend it to devotees of the area but it is definitely not a Sunday afternoon reading."
2,"A commercial, not a msterpiece as forse le lucciole...","If you like italian prog and you love ""Forse le lucciole non si amano più"" do not buy this record... it a commercial, pop one.. yes well sung and played but not shocking as the album we all know. In this record there aren't Conta (piano) and Basso (voice) .. the best musicians in Forse le lucciole...Best regards"
2,spoiled by one poem,"I was digging this book until I got to one poem where she tries to crucify Amiri Baraka. The poem is unnecessary, mean-spirited and misguided. Just because the man criticizes America does not mean that he hates America, and just because some people call him anti-semetic does not make him anti-semetic. The poem left me wondering if she ever really read Baraka's work, or just criticisms of it. Although he is not one of my favorite poets and I don't agree with him on everything, I have great respect for his work as both a poet and a playwright. Unfortunately, after reading that one poem, I lost respect for Kleinman and I struggled getting through the rest of her book. I do admit she has talent and if wasn't for that one poem I might have given her book at least four stars."
5,Camera Pouch,"This was a replacement for the camera pouch I already had. I thought it would be exact, but the new one was larger so I could fit the battery charger, cables, and extra memory cards in it with extra room to spare."
2,It broke!,I purchased this for my 3 y/o. She's not hard on her toys at all... and this broke the first day. The pieces falling off made it a danger to her and it had to be tossed.
5,Great Product!,"This is a great invention.I really enjoy the breeze now the screen has been installed. I purchased the white frame. It matches the door frame and it's out of sight when it's retracted.I have had a similar item installed in the past. Really enjoy using it on hot summer days.My husband likes to work around the house. It tokes him a little over an hour from start to finish. If you are handy, this is a great home improvement project that's worth every penny."
1,"Good product, bad management.","A good product however buyer beware!I am a professional Handyman and bought these doors for a client.I ordered 2 Larson Retractable screen doors. One came with all the parts, but one did not have the little bag of installation hardware in the box. The box had never been opened so it must have not been packaged correctly.I called Larson about the parts, but they wanted to be payed $50 for these missing parts because I bought it on Amazon!I called the dealer who interceded, and then Larson sent me some parts, however they were for a different door!This is still unresolved, I may have to make the parts myself.I won't buy another Larson product again."
2,misled,"I ordered these books with the expectation of receiving all 10 volumes, just like the picture that is posted depicts. Upon receipt, there was a note that stated that only 8 books were available, and in actuality, only 7 arrived. Very disappointed."
5,SIDE EFFECT was addictive,"It was hard to put down -- in fact, after the first few chapters, I didn't put Side Effect down, drawn as I was through unexpected twists of the plot to an unpredictable ending. The best thing about the book was the way I felt when I finished: I'd just spent several hours with characters I could like, even the professional killer."
3,TYPOS ARE DRIVING ME CRAZY,"SO FAR THE PLOT IS INTERESTING BUY I AM ONLY 8% OF THE WAY THROUGH THE BOOK AND THERE HAS BEEN AT LEAST 50 GLARING TYPOS! GOOD GRIEF!update...so far the plot is interesting...great page turner...still trying to figure it all out...but again, the TYPOS ARE ON EVERY PAGE. PARAGRAPHS ARE RUN TOGETHER, MISCELLANEOUS WORDS INSERTED IN THE MIDDLE OF SENTENCES, ODD PAGE BREAKS...ABSOLUTELY THE WORST EBOOK (AS FAR AS MISTAKES AND TYPING) THAT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED...AND I HAVE HUNDREDS"
5,Great storyteller,"This book caught my interest from the very first page, fast paced and an exciting mystery.I thought it was a great read and I'm looking forward to Sandra's next book"
5,Great read--kept me guessing to the end!,I couldn't put this book down--and I defy anyone to figure out who did what to whom before the author shows her hand! Side Effect is a fast-paced tale of scientific intrigue that gives the arm-chair sleuth plenty of mental exercise to go along with the heart-pounding suspense. It was just the right mix of plot/character development and action for me. And Feder's no-nonsense style painted very vivid visuals just begging to be translated to film!
3,"Great For Packing, Horrible For Carrying","I took this thing through Europe with me, and I have to admit that it was convenient. My sole reason for purchasing this travel pack was to have the option to throw it on my shoulders to free up my hands for other things. To that extent, this was a great success. But be warned...the straps on this bag leave much to be desired. They were uncomfortable and literally dug into my skin. A typical backpack has more cushion in the straps, which was very surprising considering the capacity of this pack.Outside of the discomfort, this is a very good bag. It seems to be built well, has plenty of room, and makes traveling a little more convenient."
2,Had to return it,"The travel pack arrived promptly and apparently in good condition. My problem is that is had a very strong odor. I can't describe it other than it's maybe a chemical smell that is emitted from the plastic? I am very sensistive to odors and couldn't imagine all my son's clothes smelling like this bag while we were on vacation. I can't say if this was an anomaly. I do know that I once bought a cheap set of luggage from a department store and one of the 5 pieces ended up having the same odor. I thought it was because I had left something wet in it and tried everything to get the odor out, dousing it with Febreze, to no avail. Since my experience showed that the odor would not eventually dissipate, I thought it best to return the travel pack."
4,The World Turns Round and Round,"Eye catchingly unique is an understatement for Nicki Weiss's The World Turns Round and Round. This is an outstanding representation of seperate worlds brought together in the American melting pot, a child's classroom. Symbolizing culture through several means, Weiss celebrates diversity through clothing, stamps, geographical, architectural and language differences. Despite their dissimilarities, a sense of unity prevails from the children knowing that ""we're part of here and part of there and the world turns round and round""."
3,"OK book, could have been better.","This is a cute little book about children in 1 classroom and how they recieve a gift from their loved one around the world. But to me, it's more a book about packages traveling around the world, with the last 4 pages at the end that talk about everyone being different but that we are also alike.On the last page there is a flat map showing all of the countries talked about in the book: Egypt, Haiti, India, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Vietman and USA. There is a pronouncation guide on how to say certain family members names in different languages and also the names of some of the presents the children received. Also included are some stamps from the country the presents came from which is cute.It's an ok book, I just thought it would be better."
2,positive advertising misleading,"Product advertised as new book, arrived in torn cellophane where pages were discolored and looked like it had been stored for years. It is a gift for my son so I wanted a new book with no signs of damage. I had other options at a much lower prices. It would have been helpful if there had been tracking info or at least an email indicating package had been mailed."
3,Makes sense... but nothing new,"It's about how to use information more effectively, and translate this into knowledge. It takes an unusual viewpoint - that of the mathematician - and as such tries to define a scientific approach (situation theory) to information and knowledge. For those of you who just want to cut to the chase, you could probably read the last 3rd of the book and still get quite a lot from it. Whilst very thought provoking, it doesn't really offer anything new, though it does provide some helpful ways of conceptualising the issue."
3,The Infosense Review,"Whether you are just curious about the information field, a small business owner, or a Fortune 500 executive every reader can learn from Kevin Devlin's book, Infosense, and apply it to their private or business life. Devlin explains in great detail what information is, how to acquire it, and then use it to your advantage. He also clarifies many points by using examples from his business and personal world, which I found quite interesting.I do have a few complaints about the author and the book. I feel that he may have targeted the business community too aggressively in an attempt to appeal to their ""buying dollar"". I also found him to be ""long winded"" and slow paced in sections of the book. When he introduced a new topic or idea he would sometimes allude to it but not fully describe it until several pages later. Everything considered if you are looking for an introductory book about this topic I would encourage you to consider reading Infosense."
3,lackluster,"I was excited to read Infosense. Its a topic I'm interested in. And on page 1 I was excited. And on page 10 I was excited and on page 15 , and 30 and 40 I began to be less excited...Devlin, who is supposedly a real master in the field didn't seem to provide any answers. Sometimes he would ask a good question and I got excited that there would be an equally good answer and instead found an answer that seemed like one a smart guy with very little time would come up with. This books reads like a disjointed work, like a publisher wanted another book...and fast and Devlin had to race to put together some ideas. I don't doubt Devlin is intelligent, but his assumptions seem to lack any kind of depth or definition."
1,Terrible,"Extremely unhappy with this seller's (Barry's Capezio) ridiculously tight return policy, especially given something as tricky to fit as dance shoes."
4,From Mario Bros to Chinese living room,"Plastique Audio is the first well-distributed Alterflow sampler. Alterflow is a bunch of (canadian) pals united for self-promoting their electronic music. Now, in 2002, Alterflow is TWO little labels, one for electro-pop and another for experimental stuff. But by the time of the release of that compilation, Alterflow was a mixture of many electro genres. So you'll find on this 2-CD set (one audio, one multimedia) ambient evolutive music, 80s wave-influenced songs, noisy & disturbing tracks, and intelligent & complex techno. Since the production of each participants are stronger now, Plastique Audio is however a tasty and a multi-textured ensemble of inspired creators. And the multimedia section is really rich in music and visuals, take note that you will spend 2 or 3 hours just for the CD-ROM..."
3,"Works great, but!","The products works great, but I wish it held my 5-in-one reflector. Because the reflector has a zipper, it makes it too fat to fit in the holders. This was dissapointing to me since this was the reflector I originaly bought it for. I do have a smaller reflector that is only two-sided and I use it for that, so I kept it. Athough, I think whoever sells this item should specify that it doesn't work with the 5-in-ones."
5,Love it!,I bought this CD just a few days ago! I love it!!! We listened to it while we put up the tree and it was the perfect background music!!!
3,Frustrating!,"This book would be better if there were not so many mistakes in tables, figures, text... It looks this edition was rushed because of deadlines... Not enough high quality microscopic and gross pictures as compared to Rosai. The editorial work in this Sternberg edition is far from being great. I think the new Rosai edition will be a better choice even if it is almost entirely written by one author."
1,No Volume 2,"Amazon does not ship volume #2 for this book since volume 2 is currently under ""review"" by Amazon. Seems like a rip off for the price."
1,"half empty, half full vs. bait & switch","This two volume set was advertised at..., but when purchased, the vendor admitted they only had the second volume for the low, low price of ... Bait & switch"
2,Sloppy,"The content of the book is thorough, although some authors do a much better job organizing their chapters than others do. The big advantage of this series lies in the histologic descriptions of each pathologic entity. That being said, a *huge* drawback is the sloppy editing. There are numerous misspellings, incorrect or inconsistent information, and mislabeling of figures - inexcusable in a fifth edition. These inaccuracies are frustrating, and I constantly question whether or not the information I'm reading is actually correct. Whenever I sit down to read, I keep a bottle of white-out nearby to correct the numerous mistakes I find. If you're looking for a surg path textbook, I'd recommend buying Rosai."
5,My little girl enjoyed this book!,My daughter has always since she was 6 months old loved Bear in the Big Blue House and so we bought her this book and she absolutley loved it. She liked identifying the foods because most of them were her favorites also.
3,"The quotes are fine, the volume is tiny.","When I purchased this I thought it would be like the first ""Quotable Woman"" volume that I love. It is not. This is a small ""stocking stuffer"" size volume. A nice little tuck in gift for a friend, but not a volume I will consult as I have the first one. Lindy Le Coq"
5,Dusty ... Pure and Simple.,"I can't say more ... than ... gritty, soulful, and wonderful. This woman was so under estimated for her time.Always a classic, no matter what you are listening to. It's sad she had to leave us so soon."
2,why like this???,"This package smacks of crass commercialism. I can't fault Ms. Springfield, as she never knew these tracks would be assembled, much less in this fashion. The studio material, consisting of film themes and collaborations, is assmebled from a number of small labels. The remaining tracks are lifted from t.v. specials of the late 60s and early 70s, and the consumer should be warned they are presented in mono. This is definitely an item for Dusty completists only, as no attempt at coherence is made in the presentation, and any non-fan would be ejecting the disc by the fourth track."
3,rosebud13050,"Item description was deseptive. Title says ""100 Golden Classics"", 3 CD's. However, upon receiving, there was only one disc with 33 songs!"
3,100 Golden Classics,"I bought this cd because the description stated that there were 100 songs, as the title states. Unfortunately there are only 33 songs and this cd is a set of 3. I should have looked closer, but the description was still a bit misleading. Other than that the shipping was fast and the price low!"
5,"HEREESYYYYYY , THE BRITISH ARE COMING!","It was fantabulous, and it moved me. I definitly loved the soundtrack and the character choices that were made. I would like to meet the woah-man who wrote this masterpiece of literature, and bear her children for her. You know Freddie Prinze Jr should read this, he would really appreciate the robustness, the comedy and tragedy, and who the hell doesn't love a good time line? Enjoy your stay, folks. FIVE stars!"
5,DVD Movie,"An excellent movie for those who appreciate great story telling, acting and direction. A must for those who value great movie making."
4,Great bio-pic and story telling,"A good piece of story telling. Using TV footage, radio commentary, the film moves fast - a technique reminds 'Raging Bull'.Change of shot and sequence between different endeavors and whims of Hughes is swift and smooth.The usage of color is of particular interest - a rare hue has been used in the entire film to underline a bygone era story.DiCaprio is impressive - acting for a crazy man marching towards madness runs with risk. He manages it well.The other actors who personify many well known Hollywood figures may not have similarity to the actual persons, still they build the characters well enough.Some scenes are real good - designing and testing of new planes, the crash landing, Spruce Goose and the Senate hearing. We can almost hear Mr. Hughes's inner soul and character during the design processes and especially in the hearing.Only I feel the film has dwelt a but much on Hughes's extravaganza - material beneath the surface could have been better."
5,Martin Scorsese Scores High!,"This is one of the best films of the year. As a front-runner of the Academy Awards, I believe this film delivers something that most movies being made nowadays lack. Cate Blanchete is the most stunning Kate Hepburn and delivers an Oscar worthy performance. DiCaprio gives off the performance of his lifetime. The cinematography and Scorsese's shots captured beautiful scenes.What really impressed me was capturing Hughes' OCD and a glimpse to what may have been his ultimate fate. This film depicts a young Hughes and DiCaprio really brings out that character with passion, almost as if he actually knew him. This is Scorsese's best film since Casino and I suggest that you RUN and watch this film, which will become an instant classic in due time."
2,Stall and spin...,"This movie was a great disappointment. My expectations were very high and I was not impressed by this movie. HH was a grand visionary and an aviation great. This movie trivialized his aviation genius and impersonalized the man. Leanardo did the best he could do. But he was a boy playing a man. The movie emphasized Howard's phobias and minimized his great achievements. Another ""Gangs of New York"". Sorry Martin."
4,A fun and interesting movie on Howard Hughes' life,"When I went to see this movie, I really didn't expect much. But after a while, I could tell it was going to be good. Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio), a big-time director, has only one thing he wants with the movies he directs--more. Nothing is enough for him. His movies are never absolutely perfect. This may be a good thing for directors, but not for Howard, as this path causes his life to be a wild and challenging one.The Aviator is an incredible movie. The acting was amazing (Leo will make you think he really is Howard), there were many funny and sad parts, and the special features were spectacular--they made me feel like I was actually in the movie. The only problem I had was that the movie went on way too long. There were many parts were where the movie could've ended and it would've been a good ending, but it just kept on going. I'd recommend this movie, and for the people who can't sit through a long movie, rent it."
3,Disappointing...,"Very well shot, fairly good acting but way too long for the short period of Hughes' life that it covers. I don't find Leonard diCaprio particularly effective in this role as he looks like a boy, not a man, no matter how much facial hair he tries to grow or have glued on. I went with a very diverse group of moviegoers and we all thought it was too long and too slow for what it covered. Kudos to Kate Beckinsale, Kate Blanchett and Gwen Stefani in their portrayals of some of Hollywood's most talented leading ladies. Jude Law really should have skipped his cameo as Errol Flynn and concentrated on his other five movies he was making. If you are at all interested in the subject matter, wait for this and rent it from PPV or on DVD."
3,Not worth 3 hours,This was a good movie. Well acted. Stunning cinematography. It would be a 4-star for a 2 hour standard length film. But it wasn't special enough in content to justify the extra time.It is the life story of an interesting eccentric person. But it's not exactly Lawrence of Arabia.
2,Shallow and lacking in in focus,"The movie does not have a deep focus whether it be Hughes as the Business Genius, Hughes as the Engineering Genius, or Hughes as the Deeply Troubled Man. Instead it hip-hops from topic to topic hoping that special effects will keep us interested and mere vignettes are sufficient. DiCaprio is hopeless as an actor when he is is required to show Hughes' slide into a compulsive isolated world. In fact the screen play gives no assistance in developing our understanding or sympathy for Hughes.Hughes' story has all the makings of a great tradegy; the hero brought down by the tragic flaw of compulsion possibly aggravated by physical injury. The only tragic element in this movie is that so much money and talent was wasted making it!It is an indictment of the movie industry that this movie is considered Oscar winning quality."
5,I got this movie for my Father for Fathers Day!,I wanted to get this Movie for my father for Fathers Day because it won 5 Academy Awards and it's a good movie. Trust me my father would really like this!
1,CRAP FILM,"Sure, this film looks great, but the costumes are NOTHING compared to the other costumes in films that were nominated at the Oscars, and the acting SUCKED. This is by far the worst, most boring, dull, and waste-of-time film i have ever seen!!! I dont know what the critics were all hyped up about. The only GREAT thing this movie has is the plane crash, and that is what i'm giving it one star for. Otherwise, this movie deserves NO stars, and I reccomend it to NOBODY. I simply cannot believe the critics HATED the Phantom of the Opera, but loved this!!! In a world of true justice and jurisdiction, this film would be put in the back room of every Blobkbuster so nobody would have to even look at the cover when they passed the ""A"" section. HORRIBLE MOVIE.... all this movie is, is BORING CRAP!!!!!"
4,Great Movie...Mediocre Blu-ray,"This is an excellent movie that shows the brilliance and illness of a legend. The acting cannot be faulted. Everyone does their job well.I can't say great things about the blu-ray because it really didn't enhance anything. That said, for $10.00 I won't complain. If you have the DVD, don't bother with the blu-ray. If you don't, it will be 10 bucks well spent."
1,"Beware, DVD has BAD color","I think *The Aviator* was the best movie of 2004 and should have won many more academy awards than it did. A modern update of ""Citizen Kane"", (without the last reel!) for most of the movie, ""Mr Smith goes to Washington"" at the end. I think this is a far more entertaining movie than ""Million Dollar Baby"" which won best picture.The Scorcese apparently intentionally diddled the color balance, there is NO GREEN, to make the movie look old timey, like the dawn of color movies!! Especially in the beginning, very distracting. I didn't notice this in the theater but you really notice the blue grass in the DVD. Beyond that it's a great movie, great character development and captures the character of Howard Hughes before be became a crazy, zillionaire drug addict."
1,Overrated,"This was a horrible movie; it could have been about half as long, but Scorsese was trying to win his Oscar. I am glad that this movie fell way short."
1,I had such consideration...,"...for Martin Scorcese that I feel very sorry for his precocious senility. I can't think of any other explanation (there is no excuse) for mistaking di Caprio for an actor (which is about as ludicrous as mistaking McDos for restaurants). And, since he's persisting in polluting the screens with something whose only merit is he never will be a ""Has Been"" (since he never was anything in the first place), from now on I will keep clear from Scorcese's movies."
1,The Aviator.,"This movie sucks. I don't know what they were trying to do,but it didn't work.The acting was OK, but the plot and the way it was presented was really bad. I'm glad they were cheap, I gave it away. No wonder you didn't hear much about this movie."
3,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The Aviator looks great and features good performances, but it is painfully long, has middling special effects, and doesn't seem to notice that it spans 30 years without many of its characters aging."
3,Why did he mess with the color of the film?,"I know, the color of the film as Hughes gets older is suppose to reflect the changes in film technology; ie: it gets better as the film progresses.I think that's getting a little bit too ""artsy"" for me. For me, it just looks like the DVD's color is goofed up. In parts of the movie the greens are almost a fuorescent blue/green; such as the plants or the peas on his plate at the nightclub.I love most any movie about Howard Hughes because he is such an interseting ""bigger than life"" person. And yes I enjoyed this movie; BUT it would have been much better if the color would have just been either black and white or color (Today's color film)."
3,One huge hole.,"While this movie is well produced and interesting it leaves out such crucially important information as to make it valueless in understanding Howard Hughes. Simply put, the movie completely ignores the drug/psychiatric connection to Hughes' eventual collapse. Always an eccentric Hughes became a morphine addict after his near fatal crash. This led to a string of psychiatric treatments that simply did what they do best.... drugged the poor man into dementia.Why did Scorsese leave this out? He tries to get the viewer to believe that Hughes descent into madness just ""happened"". Nothing could be further from the truth. How sad."
4,Fascinating biopic,"The story of Howard Hughes is a lot more exciting than I expected it to be. The film begins with the making of the lavish spectacular 'Hell's Angels' in 1930, and continues through to Hughes's battle to preserve his TWA airline after WW2.I took a great dislike to Leonardo di Caprio in 'Titanic' which I absolutely loathed. Likewise I disliked Cate Blanchett in 'Elizabeth. Here, however, both actors give terrific performances, Cate Blanchett is marvellous as Katherine Hepburn and diCaprio carries this very long film without once boring me. There are excellent supporting performances too, I particularly enjoyed Alan Alda as obnoxious Senator Brewster, and Jude Law is suitably gorgeous and raffish in a cameo performance as Errol Flynn.It is diCaprio's film though, and a very good film it is."
4,Interesting movie,"Although longer than most, it keeps you attention and interest throughout. The costuming and scenery were in keeping with the story timeframe. The acting is supurb. Very enjoyable."
1,"I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY ORDER,",IT HAS PASSED 1 MONTH & HALF AND I DO NOT RECEIVED ANYTHING YET. IM REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT IT AND I WANT A SOLUTION ASAP.
1,How boring and uninspiring a movie can get..?,"This movie is boring as hell, and then some..Avoid it if you can, unless you want to keep the seat warm for no reason at all.Only the plain crash was filmed cool.. but then again.. Discovery Channel has them too.Avoid this boring bummer!I could write more about the how's and why's this movie is bad, but it was long enough as it is, and doesn't deserve no more of my attention.'nuff said.."
1,why did anyone bother to spend the money to film this dog?,"This is the epitome of a grand Hollywood blockbuster that went nowhere and was only supported by the large amount of flack that was behind it. Not only was the story foolish as written but it was played out by a lot of bad acting. Some woman played Kate Hepburn as if she were acting the part in Philadelphia Story and not as if she were a real live human being. The male lead gave a wooden performance that was made worse by his being forced to act the part of a psychotic, which he did not do well. Unfortunately, the actor really looks like a little boy trying to act like a grownup. By the way, though the actor was clean shaven, Howard Hughes in his earlier days always had a moustache.All in all it would be a waste of both time and money to buy this or to bother watching this."
2,not worth the hype,"I already had my doubts when I started watching ""The Aviator"" and call it prejudiced, I didn't like it any more after finishing the more than 2,5 hours the film is.That's criticism one right there: it's too long, it just goes on and on about planes and how he is afraid of germs.Don't get me wrong, if you read bio's of Howard Hughes you see that most of it is in the movie. The filming and editing are all in order. Thing that bugs me most is Leo DiCaprio. He still is too young to take on roles like this. He was great in Catch me if you can or even Gangs of New York, there he is casted correctly but not here. Someone like Jim Carrey was named to as a possible Howard Hughes, I think he or someone his age would have been a better choice."
2,The Aviator?,"I really looked forward to seeing this film, my expectations were to learn about the life and times of Howard Hughes. Yes, the cinematics were first class, the special effects were great, but for the average intelligent viewer, if it does not help us understand or develop the main character it is just so much fluff.I admit Decaprio is not among my top 100 actors, but the acting was not enjoyable to watch, maybe the script was thin, but when Decaprio simply barks orders without any foundation of authority it was, well - *painful* to watch.I turned off the video not caring about the man, which is really sad because I am positive there is a really great story there that is worth telling, unfortunately, this time, it just did not happen.PS Yes I did give this DVD to a friend (with a warning) and requested that it not be returned."
2,It's a pretty boring movie. It's a pretty boring movie. It's a pretty bor . . .,"I watched this movie because I saw how many awards it won from the Academy and the Golden Globes. While there were a few bright spots, it was much, much, MUCH longer than it should have been. Don't dismiss me as the kind of movie watcher that can't stand a three-hour movie. Some of my favorite movies are the historical epics such as the Lord of the Rings, Braveheart, etc. However, this biopic just didn't have the steam to take me through three hours. The best part of the movie was the acting. DiCaprio did a fine job, and I think they picked the right people for Katherine Hepburn (Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Beckinsale, who isn't hard on the eyes, might I add). I just wish it weren't so long."
3,"TOO LONG, AND ONCE AGAIN OVERHYPED!","I was looking forward to seeing this movie for 6 months. I hada hard time staying awake, through the first half! After all theawards, and all the hype, I was hoping to really love this film.Oh well! The only part I really enjoyed, was the plane crash, asfor the rest of the movie, some of it was good. But I found mostof it to be boring."
2,It is a great movie...But it's too long.,"This film is a total disappointment-and a big waste of time. Leo's portrayal of Howard Hughes did not get my attention. Hughes' life was enormous than life itself. He was a major player, a risk-taker, and a gambler. He was america's first billionaire who turned dreams into reality,and later He lived a reclusive life. He was the man who went all out to spend his money, investing it on movies, airplanes, & aviation. Long before ""Jaws"", ""Hells Angels"" was the first blockbuster film that was ever made-And Hughes used most of his money to produce this film. If was'nt for Hughes, there would'nt be technology that would lift us up to the clouds. Howard Hughes was a true innovator."
4,"""Way of the future, way of the future.""","The Aviator starring Leonardo DiCaprio is an exciting film about the life and loves of Howard Hughes, the film also focuses on his plane crash, his obsession with cleanliness, and his financial struggles. DiCaprio should've won the oscar for lead actor instead of that over-rated Jaime Foxx. This could easily be Leo's best performance to date. And don't forget about the luminous Cate Blanchett, she won the best supporting oscar for her dead-on portrayal of screen legend, Katherine Hepburn. Kate Beckinsale also does a fine job doing her best Eva Gardner. The only thing that's disappointing is the ending, there's no real closure and it's kind of a shame since the film runs about 3 hours. This is a great biopic nonetheless so save yourself a weekend and watch this film!"
3,"not unlike its subject, the movie *just* falls short of greatness","martin scorsese directed this bio of howard hughes, covering the period from the late 20s to the late 40s. theres so much good here, i feel kinda mean in only giving it 3 stars, but sadly the movie never comes together for me. and im not sure why; maybe it needed to be seen on the big screen, and not my television set. leonardo dicaprio manages to rein in most of his usually mannered acting, but maybe, for once, he SHOULD have hammed it up, as did costars cate blanchett and alan alda. this is a film i will come back to in a few years (and thankfully its a return to form for scorsese from the abysmal ""gangs of new york""), but for now, it doesnt work in my eyes."
4,Very graphic,"My husband and I liked this movie - except for the horrible plane crash that Hughes experienced. It was so graphic and painful that my husband was still talking about it the next day. The portrayal of OCD in Hughes life was very brilliantly played by DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett made a surprisingly accurate Katherine Hepburn.The Aviator is a movie that we have to plan to watch because it is so long and time-consuming. Usually it's a rainy day film, or one that we reserve for pizza nights when it's just the two of us. It IS a long watch. I find myself skipping ahead to some more poignant scenes at times. Overall, we like it - once in awhile."
1,Horrible,"This movie is an absolutely terrible viewing experience.The movie totally focuses on Hughe's mental illness, and commits the crime of glorifying it.Whatever happened to entertainment?Whatever happened to having an enjoyable experience of watching a film?"
1,"Great movie, horrible product",I love this movie and I was looking forward to owning it. But the dvd was so messed up it hardly plays. Now how does a brand new dvd get all scratched up like the copy I recieved? This is the first of many products I have purchased through that I am not happy with.
2,IT WAS OKAY!,THE AVIATOR WAS OKAY I REALLY DIDN'T CARE TOO MUCH ABOUT IT IT WAS TOO LONG!FROM KIRSTEN
4,"""A"" for acting, ""C"" for special effects","In ""The Aviator"" one gets a replay of Howard Hughes' life once again. There is little new in the story, although I was personally unawere of the saga of ""Hells Angels"". As the story progressed, Leonardo DiCaprio became so convincing in the role of Huges that one had to remind oneself that it wasn't Hughes up there on the screen.For all of us Katherine Hepburn fans, Blanchett's portrayal of her was eerily wonderful. While it may be impossible for Blanchett to look like Hepburn, in her voice and in her mannerisms she WAS Hepburn.On the other hand, while the actors convinced, the special effects were far less convincing. The director would have been wise to avoid shots that clearly could not be made with a camera and also to give more realism to the aircraft which were about as convincing as the automobile in ""Who Shot Roger Rabbit?""Having said al of that - it is a movie well worth the theater admission."
4,History Lesson,This movie portrays a hard charging (and complex)entrepreneur who helped write American History during a very turbulent time for this country. I feel it's important for Americans to understand what helped to get us to where we are today as a country. Many of the elements that I loved about Seabiscuit (and made Seabiscuit a great movie (5 Stars in my book)are present in this movie.Don't miss it!!
3,"Good, But Unsatisfying Ending","This movie feels like the writer wasn't sure what it was about. Yes, it was about Howard Hughes, but what part of his life? His wildly successful out-of-the-box thinking and entrepreneurial spirit? His OCD? His obsession with flight? His love affairs? His tenacity when taking on the U.S. Senate? Any of those would be interesting things to focus on in a movie, but having a little of all of those things makes it a really big bite to chew. The performances are great. The settings are fine. The pacing is a bit slow at times, especially in the second half. The ending is abrupt, but it's worth seeing. At almost 3 hours, you may not want to watch it again, but it's worth a single go at least."
4,Cate Blanchett Owns This Movie,"""The Aviator"" IS Cate Blanchett's film, her Oscar deserving role as Katherine Hepburn is so dead-on, you'd think she was possessed by her spirit. As for the film, not bad, a little slow at times, the CGI is horrific, and Alan Alda's performance as the slimy senator is quite good.The Blu-Ray is loaded with extras, and the transfer is quite clean, probably in the top 20.I've never really been a Dicaprio fan, but if he keeps making movies with Marty Scorsese (""The Departed""), I think one these days, he'll get his own Oscar."
2,Disappointed,"I have been wanting to see this film since this past Christmas, 2004. I finally saw it last night and was very disappointed. I cannot believe this movie got nominated in the ""Best Picture"" category at the Academy Awards. I can understand why ""Million Dollar Baby"" won, and I haven't even seen THAT movie.I found this film, as a whole, weird. Some of the soundtrack music was annoying, and reminded me of some of the music from ""Bugsy,"" Warren Beatty's early 1990s film. It was just eery, strange, or downright annoying.Leonardo DiCaprio is a fine actor, but he doesn't look anything like Howard Hughes. Not that it really matters. In my opinion, this film is a turkey. I wish I could say I liked it, but I did not like it at all."
4,The Talented Mr. Hughes,"Honestly when I first heard they were making this film and casting Di Caprio I was perplexed, I mean I have seen pictures of Howard Hughes and he looks nothing like Leonardo, but amazingly as I watched this film I thought he embodied Hughes and even sort of resembled him. Scorsese is of course a great director and he gets the most out of Leonardo, this is a demanding character and Di Caprio nails it. The period clothes are great, this was a great time for fashion. I don't know who the cinemaphotographer was, but he does a great job, the images are so crisp and well filmed. Hughes was a fascinating subject and being from Houston, I was familiar with his story, but this indepth take is so interesting, whether you are interested in Hughes or not. To this day his grave in Glenwood Cemetery, in the shadow of Houston's skyline, is the most visited burial place in the city. Ah, the enigma that is Howard Hughes; weird dude."
4,Epic,"The Avaitor is a well acted, well directed epic. Even though it's 3 hours long, it's still easy to watch and captivates the audience. You come away from it having learned something."
2,"The Longer They Are, The Worst They Are","Why is Hollywood compelled to keep making three hour movies that could be done in two? There wasn't much to this one after the break-up between Hughes and Kate that held my interest. Sorry Scorcese, try again; and try to remember that your audience is not as in love with your work as you are."
4,aviation history,"If you follow aviation and are interested in the history this is the show for you. Hughes was a genius who received less than his due for the advancements he inspired. Requires close attention, you're gonna have to pause this one for every bathroom break. Some foreshadowing of his eventual lunacy but the film does not dwell on it."
3,The Slow-viator,"I felt like I had been robbed of 3 hours of my life. Like the spruce goose this movie barely manages to take off only to go back down shortly after. I watched this film with a group of friends, none of whom are action junkies, and by the time it was over I was the only one still awake to turn the DVD player off. Avoid this movie unless you want a lengthy biography of Howard Huges, but I personally enjoyed the actual biography more"
2,What am I missing?,"I was excited to see this movie, and then found myself getting very restless in the crowd. What am I missing? I felt like I was watching someone read a book.Leo did a great job playing a tormented man. I just did not get into the story. A movie about rich people in movie's. Great idea! 3 hours to portray what could have been done in one and a half? I think they could have really added some details and went further into his life.To me it was about planes and movies. At least it was 3 hours so I got more for my money. If this beats Sideways and Million Dollar Baby, that will be a shame."
3,Miscast Leo but Beautiful Production,"If you can overlook the terrible miscasting of Leonardo Dicapprio as Howard Hughes then you'll probably enjoy this sumptuous rendering of old Hollywood. Martin Scorsese has this fatal quirk of using his favorite performers in movie after movie. Even when that star is totally not the right one. This is the case here where Leo looks more like a high school kid trying to act in a high school play than a quirky multi-millionaire.. The role demanded a lean, intense black-haired man, who had his own eccentric way of moving and talking. To enact this, Leo throws hissy fits in which he looks even more like a teenager. Why, oh, why couldn't Scorsese have seen beyond his infatuation with Leo and picked a more appropriate actor? Anyway, this movie is worth seeing at least once."
4,Amazing blu-ray,I love this movie and can watch it over and over again. The picture quality is remarkable and really shows off what blu-ray technology is capable of.
2,Post-Modernism Visits Howard Hughes,"Say what you want about the old studio biopics that often turn up on cable channels. They were too often schmaltzy, shameless, and as historically accurate as a politician's memory. But at least they knew how to tell a story and make it interesting. On the other hand, The Aviator replaces story line with jumbled imagery, dialogue with rapid-fire editing, and a heavy-weight subject with a light-weight actor who gets serious by scowling and stamping his foot as any 12-year old might. Surely Hughes deserves better, I know the audience does. The moral is that no amount of fiddling with period detail or special effects can make up for a chaotic core. Shame on you, Martin Scorsese for lending your good name to this cinematic mess."
4,"Excellent movie, unsatisfying Ending","Fascinating and entertaining biography of Howard Hughes. My only complaint is that it ended abruptly, leaving me wanting to find out what happened after that; what happened during the rest of Hughes' life. If it weren't for the ending (or the lack thereof) I would have given it 5 stars....."
4,Worth Watching!,"Great fictionalized account of an American personality. Cinematography is excellent. Plot occasionally plods, but not too bad. Acting is great. You don't necessarily buy these movies for a history lesson."
1,"If you must, rent it first...","Depressing.Banal.Sickeningly PC.Too long.Scorsese *&* Hollyweird's completely lost it.If one *must* see this atrocity then may I respectfully suggest it be *rented* it first?Don't purchase it new. (~look at the number of ""used"" copies, eh?)If one insists on buying a copy of this stinker for themselves, contact me.I'll *give* you my copy for free & I'll even pay the shipping.That's how much I'd like to get this monstrosity out of my collection of respectable *&* worthy motion pictures so I might begin the process of forgetting I ever wasted my precious time watching it."
2,Irritating and Over-hyped,"With the exception of Cate Blanchett (as Katherine Hepburn)and some of the spectacular flying scenes, I found this film over-long, boring and irritating...(ok, it won 5 oscars but the only one that really mattered was the best supporting actress one).DiCaprio, indeed a good actor, was unconvincing as Howard Hughes and gave a lacklustre performance. I struggled to get to grips with this film as it meandered aimlessly from one scene to the next. I expected better from Scorcesse. If you like watching paint dry, you will love this movie...otherwise, stay clear..."
2,boring,"Leonardo Dicaprio tries to be serious but I found the movie to be boring and his acting skills aren't that impressive. I love classic movies and epic movies but this one is just terrible in my opinion. I just think someone else could have done a better job directing the movie as well as acting in it. Leonardo Dicaprio is handsome and I liked him in Titanic, but he isn't great here. This movie isn't for everyone and its three hours long. It was too long in my opinion."
2,Why all the awards?,"I had to make myself finish watching this movie. I don't know how this move got all the awards that it did. I guess I am just not into building airplanes. I will say that I thought Leonardo DiCaprio did a good job as always, but he was about all that I enjoyed. Maybe this movie is more for men???"
4,The Aviator Soars,"Howard Hughes was a facinating and complex American icon. The same can be said for screen legend Katherine Hepburn. I was astounded by the depth of portrayal displayed by both Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett in breathing life into these legendary, larger than life personalities. Someone once commented that going into the film, could not imagine DiCaprio playing Howard Hughes but by the end, could not imagine anyone ELSE in that role. I totally agree. DiCaprio was that good. Equally, Blanchett never faultered in her dead on portrayal of Hepburn. Bravo, bravo. The film, a bit longish at 170 minutes focused on the 20 year slice of Hughes' life between 1927 and 1947 and sometimes bogged down unnecessarily, but on the whole was a typically excellent piece of filmmaking by director Martin Scorsese. Buy this one, you'll not be dissappointed."
3,"Great intention, but I was kind of bored during the second half of this movie.","The customs were great in this picture. The camera work was also well thought out. The acting was also quite good. However, the story and most of the dialogue was boring during the second half of the movie. The first half of the movie was interesting and well-received. I think with Dicaprio repeating the same words over and over again was quite irritating and made me start to repeat the words as in a making a joke. I do think the movie is over-rated and needs a better story and dialogue. However, the directing, acting was very good."
2,"'Aviator' - - ok,overrated,not thrilling","WhenI first saw the aviator,i was dissapointed.I thought most of the scences were way to long or extended and the movie would focus on one part then move to something else.(now,if you want a great time at the movies,and a great movie overall,see 'sin city.')The aviator had it's moments,but i am going to have to give this a thumbs down."
2,I WAS A LITTLE UPSET THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD MORE TO THIS!!!!,"I was a little upset with this movie,because it was slow in certain areas in the movie and it was too long!!!!!! Leonardo Dicarpo plays Howard a guy that builds planes and then he would make movies!!!!! I love movies about people in history,but i didn't like the person Leo had to play they should have had someone else play him and i wish that it was better then what i saw!!!!!! The ending was awful and the only good thing about this movie that i really enjoyed was the setting and that Gwen Stefani made a cameo,but i would not own this movie and i would not see this movie again!!!!"
3,Meh,"Usually Leo has some good movies and this was assigned for a class (abnormal psychology). Not knowing the storyline at all before watching this film, I was actually excited. However, that quickly turned into the most boring 3 hours of my life. I fought through and watched every minute, but I would not recommend this movie unless you are into movies that aim at recreating someone's life."
5,LOVE the Aviator!!,"What a great movie - it has love, suspense, airplanes, movies, business deals, obsessive compulsive disorder.... a very satisfying and captivating movie-going experience. I recommend it to anyone who likes true stories about fascinating people."
5,Great book for filmmakers of all kinds,"this book includes all kinds of useful information that is not necessarily specific to documentary, although that is it's focus. there's excercises in here to help develop ideas into a filmic narrative, ethics, how to tackle an interview as well as subject matter. i've read a lot of film books, and i have to say, this is not only well written with a sense of humor and wit, it deals with potential situations in a down to earth way. The information provided is not just technical, but also how to approach an emotional situation, gain the trust of your participants, and address multiple points of view."
5,This is THE Text on Documentary Filmmaking,"This is probably the best book on directing and producing a documentary film that I've come across. A lot of books on filmmaking seem to be written by people who've never really made any films but can rehash what others have written on the subject and sell their advice. Rabiger's text is different, this is a text written by a seasoned documentary filmmaker that makes every chapter an insightful and useful reading experience. It may price a bit more than other documentary texts but it's worth the money spent in what you'll learn over the other books"
4,Directing The Documentary,"I am currently writing a documentary for a feature length film, and found Michael Rabiger's book informative, subtle, and well structured. Having received a documentary film class at University, I had already learned about the basic tools of the medium. This book provides a masterclass in documentary filmmaking, and prepares you for the demands of documentary filmmaking. I recommend it to students and professionals alike."
2,More about Romans than about Latin,I thought this book might be a useful supplement to a Latin class I'm teaching. This book covers more about the Romans and their customs than the Latin language. I have plenty of books about the Romans and really didn't need another one so I'm disappointed.
4,Wired and ready to go.,"For a beginer getting bonsai wire is daunting. Most outlets sell such large quantities that you could rewire your electric with it. (Dont try it)Luckily this wire comes in three sizes and is not over abundant with their quantity.I wired my bonsai succesfully with this product and definitly reccomend it.However, the largest thickness wire is extremely difficult to bend and will definitely be a pain for your thumbs.Aside from that this is simply perfect for people who prefer smaller quantity and smaller prices."
5,Works,"Great deal. Probably aluminium wire, but it works great. Used it on both of my trees and let some friends borrow it for their trees as well. Still have plenty left over. Includes the three sizes that 99% of people will need. Would highly recommend."
4,Til Death Do Us Part?,"I enjoyed reading this book. There were many times when I had to force myself to put it down. I love books where I become involved in the characters lives and feel like I am a part of the story. This book drew me in and held me captive. The author creatively and successfully combined relationships, mystery and drama in a refreshing way. I was sorry when I finished it because I would look forward to sitting down and reading it every day. This is a book that I will pick up and read again."
5,It does'nt get much better than these artist's,"Lou Rawls and Nancy Wilson are two of the best voices in the business. When Frank Sinatra says in an interview, ""Lou Rawls has some of the best pipes in the business"" you know he must be great. Rawls and Wilson can sing anything; blues, pop, soul, jazz, holiday and the list goes on & on. You can't go wrong purchasing anything that these two record. BUY THIS CD!!!"
2,The love song when they dance,"I am looking for the other version of the song when jackie and jennifer are dancing the original version is sang by tears for fears called ""I know this much is true"" but the rap version is much better."
3,First Techno Song in Party,"The song you are looking for is called ""Exploration of Space"" by Cosmic Gate. It's an awesome song. Play it loud!"
1,I VE FOOOOOUND THE TECHNO SONG!!!!!,"hey, ive found the song playing when Jennifer gives Deatrix the tuxedo (before that the guard says to Delilah ""It's rude to leave without saying bye to the boss""). The guys were right, it's exploration of space, but not by Cosmic Gate. IT'S A REMIX BY DJ MYSTIC. TRY KAZAA!!!!!!!!!give me a feedback"
2,what is the name of the song?,"I am looking for the name of the first song they play at the party the guy is having because it is not the exprolation of space that is played after it, it is the song that keeps saying ""IN THE MUSIC"" and it has more of a funky for lack of a better word beat to it. What is th name of that song?"
3,What song is that?,"does anybody know what song that is that plays when they are dancing off to the pool? just like previously stated, it has the words ""In The Music"" or something like that repeated over and over to a really catchy beat."
3,Etta James sings slow song,the name of the slow song is called AT LAST by Etta James!Great song for the movie--sad that they did not include it
3,I need to know this song?,"It was the song when Jennifer and Jackie were dancing together to try and follow the guys with the water tanks, they started dancing across the lawn too."
1,I Found that 1st party song,"I know exactly what you are talking about....the song that is playing in the background when they arrive at the party, the 1st song at the party.The song calls: Deep Swing - In The Music (Clubmix)You can download at Kazaa !!! Good Luck"
1,Answers for all,To poromenos: A music fan is correct... it's Cosmic Gate - Exploration of Space.To koliz: The song before Exploration of Space was PM Dawn - Set Adrift on Memory Bliss.
4,Another missing?,"Does anybody know what's the name of the electronic song that is played when they're in a party? I've looked for it everywhere and nobody knows. I even bought the CD, but it doesn't have it"
5,A wonderful story!,"Connie Mason is a fantastic romance author! If you are looking to read a good romance, purchase ""Tears Like Rain."" I loved this story as well as the two other books that belong in this series. The characters are amazing and you just fall in love with them all! It was well written and you can visualize everything perfectly! Connie is a great author, and a great person who really appreciates her fans. Send her a snail mail letter after you read her books. She deserves every positive compliment! Buy this book and others by Connie Mason!"
1,Disappointed,"I was pretty excited about this book because the premise seemed interesting. I was, perhaps, most intrigued by the idea of two people from two different worlds coming together. Although the premise was true to the back of the book, I was put off because the hero, Zach, was so preoccupied with Tears Like Rain being white. I am not naive to the fact that the heroine is usually incredibly beautiful, but I was surprised that Zach was actually ""more"" attracted to her because of her caucasian features. There is a line where he actually compares her to her, ""moonface"" friends. Is she aesthetically superior because she is white?And I really did not like that he immediately thought that she belonged with the white community.I'm sorry I just COULD NOT get over the racial overtures of this book to even get to the end. I actually spent the money to return it!"
3,Somewhat small,Found this offering a little slow and somewhat hard to follow. I found it slow for a 100 pages then it picked up and dropped me again. I really think that it was somewhat of a confusing story and never really brought together. I will read others as I try never to base my opinions on one book and it seems that his earlier books rated higher.
4,Wouldn't you like to know?,"How sad and shocking would it be? Really! Wouldn't you like to know? Stephen White writes about the murder of a friend of his character Alan Gregory, the father of a small boy, the husband of Gregory's dear neighbor. And the murders keep coming, staged in theaters. Before you can say ""more questions than answers"" the facts stack up and up. Only a master such as White could lay them out. Only a genius could weave this tapestry."
2,Ho-Hum,"Tried to get interested but I find the character of Alan Gregory just a bore. There are some fine sequences in this book but I felt like I was reading one of those parlor mysteries where the ramblings of the main characters were more important than the mystery itself. When the villian is revealed at the end I found myself not buying it. Maybe because of the lack of real character development or the lack of empathy for Alan Gregory. This is the third Alan Gregory novel by Stephen White that I have read and this time I have asked myself 'is that all there is? I think that this series is worth the effort to read but I warn you not to start with this entry. You may be put off and ignore others from this author which are very good reads. Also be aware that some books of the series shift the main character emphasis from Alan Gregory to Lauren Crowder, his girl firend/wife."
2,"Transparent rip-off of Norman McLean's ""Young Men and Fire""","This book's plot hinges on an event buried in the smoke of a victim's past. The event is a rip-off of Norman McLean's moving investigation of a fatal fire in 1949 entitled ""Young Men and Fire."" Perhaps Stephen White thought that by acknowledging McLean's work up front he could get away with a barely disguised retelling of the same tragedy. It doesn't work, at least not if one has read the original. While there is one enjoyable chase involving a cement mixer, it's not enough to overcome the author's misguided infatuation with McLean's powerful, original work"
1,"I Got Into ""Harm's Way""","I have read four of White's fiction novels. I would give the first three a combined rating of 9 on a 1--10 scale. Harm's Way was for me a very disappointing read. I thought the book started well with all of the elements of a great suspense novel. Then it was as if I was reading a college text on ""Mechanical Theater 101"". It was far too repititious with theater jargon through three quarters of the mid-book. The last fifteen pages were vintage White. So, to wrap it up, the book could have been one fourth it's length and been a very good piece of work!"
3,"Good, but not Stephen White's best...","This is a good book, but it's not White's best. I liked the mixture of the main plot with elements of Alan's personal life, including his relationships with his wife and friends. This particular story had a good number of red herrings thrown into the mix, so readers will find themselves incorrectly guessing certain plot twists (which is always fun!).The only thing that I didn't like was the strong element of the theater and related jargon. If you're a theater buff, this would probably add an interesting extra dimension, but I found that it interfered with the story that I was really interested in."
5,Probably our favorite Barney,"AppleBlossom calls this one the ""Stop and Go Barney"". While watching these newer episodes of Barney I am still taken aback by the set differences than from the Barney shows in my memory-- the lessons here are fun and full of energy. This video touches a topic of opposites that we had not really covered yet and now on a daily preschooler put this knowledge into practice (especially hot/cold at the faucet). Once again a DVD she requests again and again!*Thanks to the publicist for providing a copy for review.*"
2,Odd approach,"One thing that is missing is that there is no attempt at critical analysis of the Islamic texts he is using to 'prove' Christianity. Rather than even approaching the topic of the historical authenticity of the narrations from the Prophet (S), for instance, those texts which are 'convenient' are quoted as fact in order to support his argument.I think in general the idea of using Islam to 'prove' Christianity and 'disprove' Islam is weird. Because if someone doesn't believe that Islam is a valid religion, it can't be used to 'prove' something else. Falsehood does not prove truth (as a logical principle).The title is misconstrued too though as love of God and God's love for humanity is mentioned just as much in Islamic texts.The author seems very sincere though and like a nice man."
5,Best vendor!,"This product arrived in stellar condition due to careful packaging by vendor. The product was in superior condition, autographed by author as promised, and an excellent resource for Christians who have Muslim friends with questions about Christianity."
2,Keep looking,"We looked all over for a replacement dog throw like the one we bought from Costco years and years ago (still in use BTW). This at least looked like it so we gave it a shot. While it is larger than the one from Costco, it in no way compares. After one wash it began to fray and fall apart. We have it this now for less than 2 months and it is only weeks away from the dumpster. Of note, we do have an Aussie puppy and she does tend to chew, however, the majority of the issues appear to have been caused by one cycle in the washer. It does not hold up at all. Keep looking and if you find something, let me know too. Thx."
4,"Great for dogs, but could be heavier.","I bought two and they are nice sizes. Fortunately, I wasn't picky about choosing the color, but that would have been a nice option to have. My dogs like to run around on it and it gets bundled up on the carpet. If it was heavier so that it does not easily fold and bundle, it would be perfect. Otherwise for the price, great deals."
2,City Camouflage Vintage Paratrooper Cargo...,"Did not fit right. Ended up giving them to my brother, who likes them. They were very boxy shorts."
5,Superb achievement,"This is a superb achievement by Birgit Nilsson and Walter Legge. The Philharmonia plays gorgeously and my goodness, listen to Birgit Nilsson sing!! Absolutely nobody today can sing like Nilsson!! You don't know what you are missing out if you haven't listened to this.Besides this, you should get the Duet CD with Hans Hotter - another superb achievement."
5,Will get rid of ANY blemish,"This is the only blemish treatment that I have ever tried that will get rid of anything. Ive been using it for 8 years and it has never let me down.You can use it as a spot treatment or if you have an area of clogged pores on your nose you can put a little on every night to help clear those up.It isnt meant to go on the places of your face where you have no acne or blemishes though. It is strong and can cause a little peeling if you put it on your entire face.It's a little pricey, but the size of this container will probably last you close to a year."
3,on a clear day serum,"Even though I really like this product I am very disappointed with the bottle itself. The top of the bottle keeps deterioating on me.The serum evaporates, no matter how much I try to keep the container tight. Unfortunately since the quality of the rubber part is so bad I am wasting my money on this product, because I can not use it!"
4,Will come back to buy this again,This is a great product that feels clean the minute you put it on....MSM is known for its natural sulfur compound that is good for repairing and healing. I have already seen a difference in my skin by use only once daily. A good price for a good product....
1,Broke after a week,"I would not recommend this belt, I used it on a lawn tractor and it lasted me one week before it shredded."
3,Good easle but bad chain,The Easle is fine. It is easy to assemble and works find. The problem we ran into was the chain on the easle is attached to a hook that screws in the back piece of wood. That hook is not strong enough to screw in the wood without breaking. We used an alternate chain and screw but otherwise it has been a good product.
1,This book sucks,This book just states the same stuff over and over about the fear of failure and doesnt help you one bit if you are suffering from this. I beg you not to read this book unless you have time to waste because its not worth your time at all.
3,Black and red: bad combination to display.,"Gran reloj, caja de excelente cuerpo, buen peso y la elegancia va de la mano con la línea deportiva Freestyle ... pero ... los números rojos de la fecha en la esfera de color negro son tan tan tan dificil de ver ... un pequeño gran detalle a ser considerado por el fabricante.Great watch, excellent body case, good weight, and the elegance going on hand with the Freestyle sport line...but...the date red numbers in the black dial are so so so dificult to see...an great little technical detail to be considerate by the manufacturer."
1,Avoid this product,"The card reading ability of the device is worse than the rational customer might expect. The error rate I experienced was around 35%. I had scanned 30 cards, wasting time correcting data, and then the program crashed. In OSX. I hardly ever see a program crash. But here's the kicker: it didn't save the work at any point. In fact, there was no save funtion I could find easily, just export. I returned it right away, and ordered the CardScan Executive, which I run under Windows XP in Boot Camp. While it costs twice as much, its error rate is much more forgivable, at about 10%, with about 25% perfect scans/reads so far. Plus, the automatic saving and free online card data storage and synching are beyond my expectations. You get what you pay for."
1,Horrible. DO NOT BUY.,"This product does not work. Do not buy it. Everything about it is bad. Horrible user interface. Badly designed scanning unit. Unreliable OCR. Incomprehensible documentation. Software doesn't even boot on Leopard unless you email tech support and ask for a patch. Don't waste time on this. Instead, email Corex and ask them when their Cardscan product will be available for Mac."
1,Sh..ty Product... Terrible Customer Support,"This product should be a textbook case-study for a product gone wrong. First, it didn't work. Fair enough... my mistake. Secondly, I called their ""support"" in Florida, who had me download some useless link four times. Same result. Then, they stopped returning my calls.OK....So, then I called BELGIUM, where this little piece of s..t is actually made (had to get up at 6AM to do this, by the way, because of the time difference). Some Belgian girl kept me on hold for about 45 minutes, before telling me that I really needed to talk to their office in Florida.I hope this company meets Carl Icahn real soon!PS: I only gave it one star because I couldn't send the review with no stars."
3,A Fair Effort,"I purchased with excitement this CD by the Persuaders, because this selection has cuts missing from the so called greatest hits release. Happy to hear those cuts, especially ""Some guys Have All The Luck."" Simply because there were only the dull remakes available by the late Robert Palmer, and Rod Stewart, etc.I have though a real sore point, this CD was not digitally formatted, or remastered. It sound as if they put on a record scratches and all, transfered it to a digital tape, and then burned the CD. I know not why the decision was made to take such a wonderful production and screw it up this way. I guess money was the goal, not quality."
2,Persuaders - Platinum collection,"Very disappointed,I'm sorry for Rhino UK, but all the track are taken from vynil records, and this is no good!In other hand all of the songs are simply eternal classics, from 70s soul at his top, with all these vocal groups.If someone else is seeking for Persuaders' material, better search any out of this item."
5,loveoldies,brought back wonderful memories. After searching all over the place it is good to find what I want on Amazon. Amazon rocks.
1,Weak sound quality on almost all tracks,"I fully support Rick H. Haag's review except one sentence. He writes that, apart from Thin Line...,the other tracks seem to be fine. Sorry, I don't agree. Put on your headphones and you will hear vinyl on almost all tracks. The only track that has obviously been transferred from mastertape is Some guys have all the luck. Sorry Warner / Rhino...not recommended."
2,Tobor is R-O-B-O-T spelled backwards,"One of the worst sci fi robots of all time, but he makes a great pal for ""Gadg"", short for Gadget, the knickname of the grandson of Tobor's inventor. Seems that he is just as handy as Grandpa, and uses that skill to get into and out of trouble in this flick.Worth seeing if you like the genre, but not sure it's worth owning."
2,Outstanding movie. Terrible DVD,"OK, I want add to the other comments about the actual movie, it is great. My complaint with this is the poor quality of the DVD. It's massively letterboxed & digitized & looks like a poor quality VHS transfer. No extras. Hideous yellow subtitles, which are poor & not complete nor removable. As expensive as this package is, you would expect much better quality."
5,Very useful and informative book on applying!,"Paul's book is really helpful. If you aren't sure what personal experience to write about in your personal statment, Paul discusses how to choose what to write about, which is really useful. He also tells you how to write a good outline so that when you actually have to write the essay, it's not so hard.The advice on letter of recommendations is also very useful. Paul tells you how to choose the right recommenders and how to coach them so that your recommendations will really be an asset to your application.There are also many sample essays which I found very beneficial. For this alone, the book is worth it.I really recommend this book to anyone who's even thinking of applying to law school!"
4,A good reference if you are not sure what to write.,A good read. When I was trying to think about what to write for law school applications I couldn't come up with a lot. After reading what others had done it made me realize I was being overly critical of what I should write.
4,Excellent Live Tannhaeuser,"This is one of those opera plots that makes us low-pitched males wince. In spite of the fact that the stable, sensitive, intelligent baritone is in love with her, and also gets to sing the hit song, the heroine falls for the flashy, unstable, and stupid tenor. Bass-baritones of the world, unite!This live performance from Bayreuth, 1961, is superbly, subtly conducted and has some great singing. Bumbry is marvellous as Venus, and de los Angeles and Fischer-Dieskau are excellent as Elisabeth and Wolfram. Windgassen as Tannhaeuser is quite good, though he emphasizes the choppiness of the lines that Wagner gives him. (He does not have a lot of competition in the discography.) The minor roles are well done. The recorded sound is very good, though not excellent.Incidentally, for Amazon's attention, this recording does not come up among the hundred or so that are retrieved when you search with ""Wagner"" and ""Tannhaeuser."""
4,Beautiful,"Love these plates. They look so classy when my table is set. They are lightweight and stack nicely in cabinet using little space. I have both the gold and red and mix the colors during the holidays. I always get compliments on my table setting. AND, the price is GREAT!! Can't beat it."
2,poor construction,This basket is just for looks. You cant put anything over 5 pounds in this basket without it seeming like it will break.. not worth it
1,Cute but not Sturdy,"This basket is not ideal for heavy stuff. Only get it to look good on a bike or carry light stuff.For me, it didn't even last a year. The straps started to stretch and break off, then the straws of the basket start to break."
5,Great Product!,The bike basket fit my girlfriend's cruiser perfect. The 3 leather straps that come with it hold the basket to the bike to the headtube very nicely. Highly recommend this.
4,great deal!,"the basket is well made ,looks great but too small to ride my puppies other than that it was a great deal!"
1,it was a so terrible thing!! what did I order!!,I've ordered a front bike basket. but I've got a disk pad. what's wrong with me? what are the sellers thinking about..when they are sending some things...I don't understand it. I'd wanted to save my time. so I'd ordered through online site.by the way they've made me waste my time. I'll never order things through this!!
3,Not white,"The basket seems to be of a good quality considering the price. However, the picture appears white to my eyes; it isn't. I know the title says Natural Willow, but based on the picture I thought that was the material it was made of, not the color. Just so you know, it is both natural willow in material and COLOR!"
2,Mediocre at best,"Some people's reviews are really concerning and I doubt whether they are true critiques or just play something in the background and have no clue what makes an album quality or not. I bought Hazen because it was on sale and the band LOOKS hardcore. Unfortunately I was mistaken.The sound is uninspiring and VERY amateurish. Too many call and response hooks, the song writing is so simplistic it borders on annoying in many songs. I guess my main disappointment is that there are many quality bands out with alot of talent and potential who are not getting a shot while sub-par talent with industry connections move up the ladder.Hazen St. would make an excellent rock band to play at your local bar but to pay your money for their album? I would recommend looking elsewhere."
4,Hazen Street's first debut....solid effort,"I enjoy listening to debut albums from new band's who have formed, worked their hearts out and are confident enough to release their work to the music mainstream media and to be judged accordingly. Hazen St can be described as a band of young men who have come from tough livelyhoods and made something out of their situations - bettered themselves. For that, they should be congratulated. Now the CD self titled release does have flaws and yet is a strong album for the band. Give this band ago, listen and relisten to the album twice and the songs will grow on you as they did on me. 'Fool The World' is easily the best single of the album and is their signature hit song. The other nice songs full of great hooks in them are 'Sorry' and 'Trouble'.The reader must remember that this is the band's first release and if they stick together, they will only get better. I hope they won't be one hit wonders."
3,"Okay, for their first album...","This CD isn't exactly bad, but it just sounds like they were still trying to find their sound. And it's not that the songs are too similar to each other, it's just that there's so much more variety on later albums that it seems that way. And the vocals don't suck or anything, but this is definitely Groovie at his worst (which, by the way, is still better than just about any other singers I can think of..). Some of the musical arrangements are still pretty good though.My picks for the best songs would be ""And this is what the Devil does!"" ""Kooler than Jesus,"" and ""These Remains."" Since this was supposed to be a soundtrack for a movie that was never made, it's has a very, um, soundtrack feel to it. And if you listen to the whole album, it'll grow on you. It's just that it's so much slower and darker than their later albums. But suffice it to say, if I had never heard any of the later albums and I heard this, I would still like it."
3,"If you like MLWTTKK then you need this one, but not the best","Not their best album, but good album covering their music. Industrial and Gothic-punk in nature, the album is definately worth getting if you like the Thrill Kill Kult, But I would probably look to get their ""Thirteen Above the Night"" album first."
4,Not bad for their earlier stuff,"I didn't like Confessions Of A Knife-- it was even more contrived than this album. 13 Above The Night was pretty lame also. If you like TKK's earlier ""gothic"" music then get this album. Personally I like their sleazy, groovier music better; like Sexplosion, A Crime For All Seasons, Hit & Run Holiday, and Dirty Little Secrets."
4,Not bad,"I got this for a movie role I am doing, it looks great, it is just not suited for larger pistols."
1,Product is not functional,I saw mixed reviews and thought for the price I would take a chance.That was a mistake. I received the item quickly (2 days) however once I opened the product Both Holsters were all but sewn shut. There is no way to place a weapon in either side. Both the top and the bottom of each holster has an opening about 1 inch only. It would appear this manufacture has no quality control at all. The item is now being returned for a refund as a replacement was not an option for this particular item.Please do not waste your time even at this price the product is not worth it as it just does not serve the intended purpose.
3,Works alright,"Bought these for a halloween costume ( Agent 47 ) which they worked brilliantly for, but if I were to use these for airsofting or to hold actual weapons while hunting I would think a strap to go around my back as well would help the stability of the holster. Past that they work well."
1,P.O.S. not worth the time to look at it,"This is a cheap peice of s***. First you can't get a squirt gun in the holster, second if you can afford two gun don't be this cheap! uncle mike has a cross holster for $35.00 thats very nice"
4,Deceiving Pictures,"Just to clarify, this holster comes with one gun holster and holds two mags. Beside that it feels nice, solid black, haven't used it, i will Update when i do.Quick shipping fyi.Update:12/12/12 Havent used it in an actual combat situation. But i got my gun today and tried it out. The holster is too small or my gun is too big, but my gun fell out, i had to cut the seam to get my trigger in the holster and still then the clip wouldnt fit. In the picture it shows the holster just hanging. Thats how it hangs on you, there is some loose velco straps im not sure for what, but they are too big for my stomach to secure the holster and dont work to do it on the back. The mag holders are good.Pros:Great BuildGood Mag holders, holds 3 mags.Cons:Gun didnt fit easilyGun fell when runningHangs looseUpdate: 12/12/12The loose velcro straps are to attach to your belt. Makes since now... I will try it out but i am sure thats what they are for"
3,Great for airsoft but not for the real deal,"This product is not secure enough for carrying the real deal. Wouldn't want a loaded gun to fall out, hit the ground and get shot in the proccess. Great for airsoft but spend the money on a leather setup if you intend to carry when out and about."
1,Not as advertised,"Maybe it's bad wording, but this is NOT a dual holster. It's a single holster, the other sides holds clips.Already had one like that so am dissapointed. The holster it self is fine and as you would expect for the price, just is not what I thought I was getting."
1,Should have read the reviews first,"As everyone is stating that was disappointed, this is NOT A DUAL Holster.The picture if very misleading and the wording is worse. Thankfully, this was a gift to someone else, and perhaps I can use it.------ NOT DUAL HOLSTER -------"
1,you get what you pay for,mine came in sown completely together and you couldn't even put a gun into it. Horrible choice for a shoulder holster.
1,Not what I wanted!!,The Item I recieved was not what I ordered. I ordered a Double draw shoulder holster and got a single draw with a magazine holder!
2,As I see it,"This is my 1st ever review; After reading the reviews on this item, I purchased it. Well, I tried it on and after many adjustments made, I was going to wear it around the house 1st before out in pubic. Very wise move on my part. About an hour or so, the back of my neck strap came loose and both my glocks fell beside my legs on both sides. Grateful that the straps held them in place! After a few more things happen, I just took the holsters off and put them to better use and did away with all the other junk. After all of this, I asked myself, did these other people that wrote the reviews buy the same item that I did?"
5,Wonderful!!,"Practical Tips for Abundant Living is a fabulous resource. Clearly written, easy to read and grasp, and so very insightful, this book should be included in everyone's personal library."
2,Hopelessness Glorified,"It would be hard to find a bleaker film. Wakamatsu's film is considered one of the classics of late 60's, early 70's Japanese underground film and that is unfortunate. The central character is [violated]..., and then hangs out in the same place, only to be [violated]... again. In portraying such an evil crime in this manner, the Director is adding fuel to the idea that some women want to be.... Instead of creating empathy for the female lead, the director portrays her as usable and disposable. There is no humanity in this film only dispair."
2,Popeye the TV Man,"Fair warning to fans of the classic Fleisher/Famous Studios Popeye cartoons-Look elsewhere! These Popeye shorts were from ""The All-New Popeye Hour"" by Hanna-Barbera, and don't have the same punch of the older series (Pun intended). This DVD is not recommended for Popeye purists."
4,Good book on Scandinavian expansion/influence,"I have used this book in medieval history courses and courses on the Vikings with a great deal of success. It's well-written, engaging, told in a logical sequence, and it covers areas that other, similar books do not. It tends, however, to be a little over-corrective in its approach and minimizes the devastation of Viking violence on some more settled societies. He calls the raiding parties ""exuberant, at times destructive,"" making them sound more like Labrador Retriever puppies than sometimes murderous bands. Overall, though, it's a very good survey."
4,Wrong Title,"This movie is called "" The man on a Spying Trapeze "" It IS NOT Jerry Land as printed on the box.The quality of this DVD is like a bad VHS tape. As a matter of fact I have a VHS copy from Something Weirdcollection and the VHS is better quality. Sinister Cinema really should make an effort to make good qualityDVD's as these old Euro Spy movies are a GEM to watch. Overall, its watchable and a very enjoyable film abouta spy called Jerry Land looking for a Micro Film ( surprised ? , nice twist in the plot towards the end. Its dubbed in English and sometimes the lips don't match the words which makes it even more enjoyable if you like that sort of thing."
2,Faded print of a so-so flick.,"Don't want to be ungrateful to Sinister for releasing, but this is an unusually bad print even for them (faded, worn). (The trailer posted on Youtube is in much better shape.) Movie is ok, not great but not terrible. No idea where they got the trapeze title idea (no circus to be seen)!"
5,Edge of your Pants Mystery,"Very well written mystery and couldn't stop reading. Didn't want it to end. If you love horses and a great mystery, you will love this one. Enjoy....."
2,*YAWN* if you need to fall asleep....,"The beginning of the book leads you to believe it will hold your attention and interest, but rapidly fails on all fronts. The relationships are superficial at best. I learned more about gardening in a drought than I care to know and the fact that the main character knows more arsenists than the FBI is outrageous.The main character flits around her life through most of the book, then to wrap it all up, the action quickly takes place in the last couple chapters. Save your money for another book. BOO!"
3,To somebody's knowledge here...,"THE MUSIC WAS CHANGED...AGAIN,exept for the musical guests performances.But personnaly,I'm not very into this show and I think the seasons coming are way better than the first ones,so it's really sad to realize there's nothing left to like in this set anymore."
3,Uncut? Uncensored? NOT AGAIN!,"I was suckered into buying Season 1 on DVD by the advertising saying ""Uncut and uncensored."" Of course, I thought the DVD would feature additional scenes that couldn't be shown on TV, but guess what! NO NEW scenes!!! The only thing different from the televised versions that I HAD ALREADY SEEN was the theme song. The familiar AND likable Elvis Presley theme was gone on all but episode 1. So I guess CUTTING the song out isn't considered REAL cutting, or maybe these DVDs ARE cut. Either way, I have been turned off to even THINKING about purchasing Season 2 because of the false and misleading advertising of Season 1, apparently being repeated again. As for the show itself, it's rather entertaining, with good acting and lots of lovely ladies to look at."
3,great show with some flaws,this show has great lead acting and a solid storyline. Some of the storylines not around the two main actors of the show tend to drag a little.
3,Slowly losing it's appeal,"I used to love this show and in fact I still do, but just not to the same extent. It's funny, but it's getting a little dull because what is there really to achieve now. There's nowhere for it to go. If I'm going to be totally honest, I'm watching it a lot for Mike and Danny. They are so cute. But I'm also watching it to pass time. There is certainly nothing gripping about this anymore and now that I've heard Lara Flynn Boyle is going to be in it? - I think I should quit while I'm ahead."
1,Hmmmm... It just gets too much,I like the first season better. Something is not working right.The story is getting more and more unrealistic and all the felmale casts are getting more and more whore looking. How can you run the casino with that less people.
2,For someone who loves the city - WHAT A BORE!,"Everyone loves Vegas right? Yeah, including me... the city that is. This could have been edgy and interesting - but I'm figuring that the powerful hotel chains would have denied use of their images or use of locations if this were not more than the safe, predictable pap, this show has turned out to be."
1,Not a happy shopper.,The CDs was /is cracked to the point that it do not play . The disc were all very dirty and really didnt play at first.I am very disappointed and kinda feel that I wasted my money. I would let to exchange it or get replaced.
5,Las Vegas - Season Two,"This series is entertaining to any level of viewer. It has humor, intellegence, a certain macho, beautiful women and an enviable lifestyle. It's success is absolutely the result of good writing and exceptional casting. The relationships of characters seem real and geniune, not acted at all. And the show just seems to get better with each season."
3,Las Vegas - Season 2,"I love this series...however, multiple disks came with scratches on them. I'd give this a higher rating, but now I have to go through the process of returning the damaged disks and wait for a replacement."
4,It cuts like a knife.,"Even though I owned their debut first, ""A Daisy Chain For Satan"" was the first song I ever heard from them, and I instantly wanted to hear more. Musically this is a great techno/industrial album, but lyrically it's very dark. Sex, drugs, and Satan. Some of the tracks are very upbeat and aggressive, while others are almost hypnotic, especially in the right state of mind. The albums ""I See Good Spirits and I See Bad Spirits"" and ""Sexplosion"" are excellent as well, but I think this one is probably even more essential. It's a good combination of all things ""TKK"". Plus it's now remastered with extra tracks. I'll never get rid of my vinyl though."
5,TKK's Best Album by Far......,"This is one only of 2 albums I've had to buy a second copy of because I had worn out the first. It's that good.TKK has something of a unique sound. They blend industrial with house/disco. This is probably their most industrial sounding album, but it's also still very dancey, not like true industrial.All songs on this are great. Kooler than Jesus is probably their most popular, or at least the one heard in clubs the most ""I'm the electric messiah....the AC/DC god."", but it's probably the worst song on the album."
2,Two hit wonder (At least on this album),"I love edgy, alternative music, and was expecting much more from this group than what I got. 'Daisy Chain 4 Satan' and 'Waiting for Mommie' are actually pretty good, with some awesome sampling added that makes them really snappy. However, the rest of the album is a mish-mash of uneven quality, without any real draw. For some reason they decided to repeat 4 of the tracks on this CD, but it's a mystery as to why they did it. Supposedly they're different versions, but the differences are so subtle as to be almost imperceptible, and don't enhance the songs that were remixed. Look for it in a bargain bin near you. :("
3,Something of an aquired taste...,"This album is creative and daring, but a bit ersatz. The songs rely on cheep computer sampling and repetitive lyrics giving the music a dirty drunken quality which significantly reduced my enjoyment. It's okay. You'll like it. But if you have a more refined taste in music you'll find this album gathering dust in your collection."
4,.,This is a good video. Kinda boring. It shows a cobra spit at Steve without sunglasses. I say wait until this comes on TV again.
1,No way to handle venomous snakes.,"Teachers and parents should be advised that Steve Irwin is far more interested in Steve Irwin looking daring than in young peoples' welfare. If North American kids try handling any of our resident deadly snakes the way Irwin does, they'll end up very sick or possibly dead. Even non-venomous snakes should not be handled this way. Of course, the video does not >advocate< children handling snakes in this fashion, (So the distributors of this series could not be sued!) but that is not how a young audience works. There is a considerable risk that if something appears cool, it is worth ""having a try"" on one's own."
4,"Good, cheap, a bit rough on the finish","The finish on these is a bit rough - I had to trim flashing on the compartment dividers, but once trimmed, these all fit correctly and tightly. A good box. For the price, I don't mind having to do a little work up front to make things fit right."
5,Love it!,I have bought about 9 of these so far and plan to buy more. I use them to store my long feathers for hair extensions and they are the perfect length! They are also really thin which is great because these skinny feather don't take up much space and other tackle boxes I've use had WAT too much space in each section that I wasn't using and the thicker boxes took up more space in my studio. These Plano 3701 boxes are awesome!
5,Plano 3701 Divider,We use it to store computer chips for triathlons which need to be sorted by number and distributed on demand. It provides virtually instant access. It is well made and secure which makes it safe and easy for transport.
3,Too shallow for Carcassonne,"I bought this to consolidate my family's board game, Carcassonne, and all its pieces into a single case. However, this box is too shallow to hold the game tiles. Do NOT buy this product to use as a storage case for this tile-based board game."
1,Don't buy this...,"This is a really unsafe float for a infant or young child. My husband bought this for our daughter last year and I couldn't believe how easily this rolled over in the water, and you can't get child out. I life guarded for 13 years, and would never take my hands off my 1 year old child in our pool. She made a simply rocking motion in the pool and the raft flipped over. I had a terrible time trying to flip it back over or even getting my daughter out of it. To make sure no child would ever use it again I cut it up with scissors. This is dangerous, please don't buy this item."
1,Beware!,"Please be very careful with this product. We were sitting in the kiddie pool with our son and he leaned over in this seat and it tipped him upside down, head first into the water and the seat held him down under the water. We were right there, so we pulled him up right away. DO NOT turn your head even for a second with this product. It is dangerous."
5,Similar Baby Float,"This product looks identical to one we got for our 3 month old baby girl this last summer, only ours was made by Intex Co. We (and she) have absolutely loved this float. It is so stable,untippable, and raises her up enough so her head can't slip down too far. We take our baby everywhere with us and this float has allowed her to accompany us in pools, the lake, and in the hot tub. For the hot tub, you can put a thick towel across the float, then lay the baby on top. The warmth of the water comes through without being too hot. At 9 months now she can really kick her legs and swim along in it."
4,interesting,This book is written as if the author is speaking directly to you. She is very knowedgeable and makes you want to read more.
4,Very Good for Beginners,"Wish I'd read this book years ago, when I first started studying Buddhism. Howley strips away the various cultural accretions that make most strains of Buddhism confusing/contradictory to a novice, thereby laying bare the essence of true and original Buddhism. This review is very short, but all you need to know is this. If you want a simple (not simplistic) explanation of Buddhism, then this is the volume for you."
3,High priced intro to Buddhism.,"I would have rated this product higher if the price had been more reasonable. This audio book is only 5 hours long. For $40 I expected 10-12 hours of information. There are several other fine introductions to Buddhism in the $10-20 range, offered here, that are better values.Aside from the price, this is a good introduction to the teachings of Gautama. It would be well worth about $15."
3,"Weakest of the three ""small orchestra"" versions of Schubert I've heard.","I would agree with the reviewer who felt that symphonies 1-6 sound best played by a smaller orchestra. The sound on these Hanover Band discs is far less appealing than on the COE/Abbado or ASMF/Marriner. As far as interpretation, I think the differences favor Marriner, with the cleanest and tightest ensemble. These are works of the late Mozart or early Beethoven mold, though they have Schubert's own unique voice as well. The 8th and 9th, by contrast, are larger and more overtly ""romantic"" works, with a much wider range of possibilities for interpretation. Try Karl Bohm for the ""unfinished"" or Joseph Krips, Colin Davis orGunter Wand for the 9th. There are plenty of others as well, which are enjoyableand very few real ""duds"" as these are terrific compositions."
4,Great coloring book...,"I bought this for my daughter's fifth birthday. She loves it and is still coloring in it after a year. It still wins out over other, newer coloring books she has. I would buy it again."
3,"Wish I had looked through it, misleading",This was an impulse buy and I didn't read the reviews which is something I almost never do and I certainly learned my lesson here. The picture and title are very misleading. Many of the pictures are of other animals with horns and none of them are the girly pretty pictures I was thinking when I handed it to my little daughter. I would say if the book is for someone into mythology and creatures this would be a good book but most of those children are older and don't like to color as much. Just look through the inside first and see if it is what you are looking for. The illustrations are fairly decent and there is a little blurb on each page.
4,love unicorns,The little girl who got this is in love with unicorns and has been enjoying this book. It has a nice collection of pictures.
2,Error in description,This item's dimentions are incorrect in the description it is only 2 inches deep not 3 inches. Other than that it is a quality plano product.
4,stowaway,"I bought this product at the request of another person. But I can say That the delivery was on time, he bought because he liked the price and I think she liked the product"
5,Great quality!,"Quality is outstanding on this product. It is also fairly larger then I thought it would be. It fits a lot of stuff, glad to be supporting made in the USA products too!"
2,it's ok...,"It's ok, but not very easy to work with. Dividers are hard to put in and take out. The biggest problem is getting smaller items out of it. You have to turn it upside down or use a magnet sometimes. Not convenient."
3,Small,"This was very ""short"" for lack of better words. I expected it to have more depth...but I found a use for it. It does not work well for storing polymer clay in however, it does hold small paint bottles well!"
4,Game Storage,"If you have a ton of little game pieces, this is a great storage device to get. It makes cleaning up that much easier."
2,Not enough dividers,Half as useful as it should be since I did not receive enough dividers for even half the compartments in the box.
3,Not quite large enough,"While this was a good value, I would have liked it to be larger. Also, the dividers were very difficult to install."
2,"Some good things, but some caveats","Others have mentioned that this was a book for writing pot-boilers. It's true.That said, there's three really useful bits in the book:1) cause and effect -- I often critique manuscripts that get it wrong;2) structure of a scene;3) scene linking through transitions and sequels."
3,Useful in Both Cases,"Scene & Structure is a useful read, even if you hate it. Disagreeing with Bickham's thriller writing style, with his disaster-in-every-scene, and his overall, nearly set in stone approach to telling a story will give you plenty of wonderful examples of exactly what NOT to do in your fiction if you dislike this work.If, on the other hand, you are looking for direction in your writing and lack any sort of structure whatsoever, reading this will also help. You will make sense of the typical flow of a story, most notably the parrying and jousting between scenes and sequels and get general (very, very general) plotting tips. Bickham's advice will give you a basic starting point to develop your work and eventually break his rules. And for the sake of trees, your time, and the time of your readers, please do break them."
1,Out of touch,"I don't know what book you folks were reviewing, but the advice in this book is so out of date it should be in a museum. I should have listened to the two reviewers who dissed the book. How on Earth can someone advocate such a formulaic approach to storytelling? Scene-sequel-scene-sequel ad infinitum. And to say that every scene should end in disaster... I reread that multiple times to be sure that's what he was saying. Imagine a Clancy novel with this approach. There would be no resolution!Skip this book. Get Stephen King's On Writing, and Elements of Style. You'll learn a lot more."
1,Rambling,"This book surprised me by its rambling and repetitive commentary after a promising start. Unlike other books on the craft of writing a short story or novel, Scene & Structure does not start at the beginning of the writing process and move forward; instead, it ambles from topic to topic with no overall guidance. Also, the author's corny references to himself (such as regretting his age) are silly and misplaced. I didn't buy this book for a bunch of laughs, but to get serious help. The book Beginnings, Middles and Ends, for example, or one of the many books about whipping out a novel in 30 days give more pithy information in a more organized format."
4,Elements of Fiction Writing - Scene & Structure Jack M. Bickham,Elements of Fiction Writing brings together many points an aspiring author needs to consider when writing their novel. The books goes hand-in-hand with Hooked by Les Edgerton.
2,I'm very grateful for Emily Hanlon's review,"I'm very grateful for Emily Hanlon's review. I was halfway through this book and finally had to come here to read the reviews. Thankfully, there was a two star review by someone who I trust, because i just couldn't trust what this guy is selling. Most of the problems I had with this have been stated, but i became confused when he says things like reader's need to catch their breath, yet he doesn't make it clear how a reader should catch their rbeath, because he goes right back to insisting on constant disasters. I was concerned for my own characters, who would lose so much of the charm I've spent so much time trying to create if i followed these rules... i have ADHD, so i have one aderal to take a day, and i take it to immerse myself into a book... i have NEVER had so much trouble getting deep into a book as i did with this book. it was a waste of my time and my aderal."
2,Too much on too little,"How Bickham managed to write 168 pages on just this concept is beyond me. His chapter Scene and Sequel in WRITING NOVELS THAT SELL covered this topic good enough. Buy that book instead, and you can learn a lot more than just this."
1,Formula for Melodramatic crap,"The author suggests that ending with disaster is a fundamental part of the scene. It is beyond obvious that this is wrong! In the story is to have a happy ending, then at least the last scene must end in success. Even with this excecption, it still means the protagonist still has to overcome all of the obsticles in his way in the last few pages of the book. It would be extremely difficult to pull this off legitimately."
5,Communicating for Dummies,The book is well written with plenty of illustrations. It is everything I hoped it would be.
3,"Closer to 3 1/2, actually","I read this book after Bob Keppel's excellent 1995 work THE RIVERMAN (a never-dull glimpse into Ted's twisted psyche). I must confess this was better than I expected, but I was disappointed to some extent. While Larsen tells about the Ted he met and the experiences he covered as a reporter during the investigation, it has the feel of a TV Tie-In, as this is. It just seems like a summary of everything else written about Ted. I was impressed by the amount of detail in this book about the Chi Omega murders and Ken Katsaris' publicity stunts with Bundy exploding in Katsaris' face. Good for people just becoming aquainted with Ted."
4,I enjoyed this book.,Stranger Within the Gates is a good book with a surprise ending. I enjoyed it but it's not my most favorite GLH book.
5,Totally different Grace Livingston Hill story,"The Garland family is surprised to receive a letter saying that Rex is married and bringing his wife home for Christmas. But Rex is only 18 and not finished with college. And the family had no idea he was getting married! They are very apprehensive about meeting Florimel, the new bride..."
4,Nice Starter Book,"The book has tons of pictures. Some of the sets shown are not ""true"" sets. It is a great book to get a general idea of all the many themes of salt and pepper collecting. High end and low end are all well represented. It was fun to see sets I never knew existed that I would like to have. It gave me more stuff to look for in auctions. It's always fun to add to collections!"
4,For the collection,Very nice book. plenty of nice colored pics and a large number of s/p shakers pictured in this book. i would deal with any of the people that i recieved books from.
3,A Great Book For Quick Refrence About The Old Pagan Gods,This is a great book if you want ot brush up on your knowledge of the old Pagan Gods. It is also interesting to just skim through. Though the descriptions are not very detailed they are definitely sufficient for most. Not good for report refrences but surely delightful to have around.
3,Modest but interesting effort,"Handy to have around if you have a casual interest in the old pagan gods. Makes nice browsing. Not for those who need to do in-depth research, but it gives a nice quick overview of a number of different pantheons."
5,One Album I Never Get Tired Of,"Lucky me, this was my introduction to Diana Krall, and to be honest, none of her other albums have surpassed this one in quality in my opinion.These are primarily jazz standards and very singable. I find myself belting them out every time I listen to it.I'm not normally a fan of live albums, I only know of one other that is fantastic, but I love, love, love this album!I don't see how anyone who loves jazz could possibly be disappointed.Superb!"
5,CD vs DVD,"Here is what is on the DVD but not the CD:* All or nothing at all* Cry Me a River* Pick Yourself Up* Love Letters* I Don't Know Enough About You* Do it Again* Let's Face the Music and Dance, xtra music videoHere is what is on the CD but not the DVD:* Just the Way You Are* Fly Me to the Moon"
2,"Rehash, save your money.","Some of my favorite music is from Ms. Krall. This isn't it. These are, for the most part, simply cuts from her other albums, worked in about the same way. Adequate concert material, perhaps, but disappointing in a CD.If Krall fans were honest, they would have to admit that she is a jazz pianist first, with often great arrangements, but sadly lacking a voice. Her ""speak-sing"" is like Tony Bennent has become in his old age, or Sinatra at the end of his career.Still, at least instrumentally, she has a good feel for jazz which makes her worth a listen. Best on slow, melancholic ballads such as the haunting ""A Case of You"". Not enough of these on this album however. Again I came away wishing her albums were instrumental only."
2,Can't sing ... she's bad,"She can't sing but she's a good jazz pianist. I like her earlier release ""All For You: A Dedication to the Nat King Cole Trio"" much better.The tracks on this cd are uneven in recording quality - they were cut from different live and studio sessions.Previous reviewer justifiably compared her to Tony Benett as in seriously over-rated shouting. Ms. Krall has problems pronouncing words clearly, like her mouth was shot full of novocain."
3,DO IT RIGHT!!,"This disc is great because it is Diana Krall live, and Diana Krall is great. However, if you're an artist that wants to record a live disc then my advice is to RECORD THE WHOLE SHOW!!If it takes 2 discs to do it, fine, but do the whole show or nothing at all. One example from this disc is the song ""Cry Me A River"". The song was on the DVD for the show, but left off of the CD. :-("
5,Brandy smooth and whiskey warm,"This was my first Diana Krall album that i've purchased and I'm sure won't be the last. I bought it on a whim because I recognized her from a guest appearance with Elmo on Sesame Street. =)Ms Krall's voice is magical. Soothing and warm.Unlike some other reviewers, I can't go into arrangement, production, and the like.But if you want to think cozy warm romantic thoughts, curl up in front of the fire and just relax and listen, than this is definitely the choice for you! Sit back with a loved one, or on your own and let Ms. Krall's magical brandy smooth and whiskey warmed voice take you away."
5,One of Diana's Best,"I bought ""Girl in the Other Room"" and did not care for that depressing album at all. But when a friend played this for me, I could not believe it was the same singer. This is an amazing album, full of swing, sass, life and great orchestration, everything the other album is not. I am going to have to listen to her other previous albums now. This one was wonderful, I hope there is more from this singer like this!"
2,"Good, but not consistent","I bought this CD after seeing Krall perform on BET. She is a talented performer, but this CD is uneven. Specifically, the selection of songs felt uninspired--even trite, and I when I heard her sing ""Just the Way You Are,"" I knew this CD did not do justice to the performance I so enjoyed on TV."
5,outstanding,JazBrat's review is not quite correct:Most of the material here is not included on the Video/DVD version of these appearances - this CD is no clone of the DVD - I believe only 2 or 3 tracks are also on the DVD. also included is a bonus studio track (cover of Just The Way You Are - from an upcoming film)Word is that Verve Records recorded 4 nights and Tommy LiPuma (producer) and Diana picked their favorite tracks - with an apparent focus on her small group performances.the recording quality is impeccable - here's your chance to bring Diana's live show home with you...fabulous
3,Less than Perfect,"I was disappointed in this particular CD because I felt that, instead of amplifying the Diana Krall experience, it just pandered to the ""I'm on tour so it has to sound different"" school of thought. Her CDs/voice are always an intimate journey into jazz but this CD found me, even after numerous chances, fast forwarding to see if the next one was better. I love Diana Krall and this CD is fine but it is not her best work, by far."
4,Another winner from Krall,"This is a nice recording with some new material and much that has been released on earlier recordings although this version is ""live"" so audience applause is included. A ""must"" for Krall fans since her piano playing is superb and the other musicians work especially well with her on this recording. I'm delighted that ""Fly me to the Moon"" is included since I loved her version in concert."
2,Nothing new,She plays jazz standards with good voice and solid technique. That's it. I'm a little sad that many other creative jazz musicians don't have as much popularity as she does.
3,A CD for the true jazz fan,"This CD is vey ""Jazzy""; by that I mean there is a lot of piano playing and double bass, but not enough singing, in my opinion. I don't really like the fast tempo and the piano all the time, and I think it overrides Diana Krall's beautiful voice."
1,"Money, money, money...","It's too bad Diana betrayed the music she was promising so many times to be devoted too ( OK, she bent it ). Miles Davis wanted to be as famous as Michael Jackson, I wonder what a role model is for Diana. After 3 consecutive albums with same catchy material maybe it's time to go back to jazz...We'll be patient, since you're are a musical genius and a Canadian too."
2,A Red Bull and Some Vocal Coaching?,"Does this woman have any vocal range or vibrato at ALL? Or does she sing every single song in the same key, tempo and way? If she is the standard that other Jazz ""divas"" (Pardon the cliche.) are expected to live up to nowdays, then Jazz is seriously slipping. Jaimee Paul can outsing Krall ANY day of the week and with 20x more flava! She (Krall) may be an adroit pianist, but her voice leaves a LOT to be desired. Vocally, she chops the ends of every word/note short and in a live setting, I can't imagine her showing any more (or less) personality than she shows in her music already.With Shirley Horn, one feels warm all over. However, with Krall, there is no warmth; just cold, gray, lifeless and dull EVERYTHING. Granted, her voice is sexy with its raspiness, but by NO MEANS is it enough to tow the line for years to come. She could use a Red Bull and some vocal coaching in MY opinion.A personality wouldn't hurt either."
1,WOW WHAT A LET DOWN!,"I ran across Diana Krall's name on Amazon while purchasing some blues CD's. Based on the almost universal wild acclaim in the reviews I decided to purchase her CD - the quality of the songs that were on the CD also convinced me that it would be very difficult for anyone to screw them up. I apologize to Diana Krall fans but I only made it through the CD 1 and a half times before I punched the eject button and tossed it in the trash - $... down the tubes. If you enjoy monotone, mumbled droning of classic music - please be my guest and buy this CD. Bob Dylan sings with more inflection in his voice than Ms. Krall."
4,Live in my living room.,"I absolutely love this CD and I am so glad I bought it. I first heard this CD when dogsitting for a family I know socially. The father of the family was really into Jazz and ""Live in Paris"" was my first attempt at listening to his collection. I was instantly impressed with the songs on this CD and found myself addicted to Diana Krall's rendition of ""Let's fall in love."" In fact, I would like to say I bought the CD for this song alone but there are other musical treasures within this CD.I don't believe I will see her play anytime soon but it's nice to know that I can hear her play Live in my living room anytime."
3,Jaded Listener,"I can't say I've ever been blown away by Diana, but this album turned me off somewhat. Like many female singers of note - Jennifer Warnes, for instance - Diana's voice can be too strong, and in too many places here she doesn't restrain it. Perhaps she's a better jazz pianist than jazz singer. I do enjoy the instrumental portions of this album."
2,NEWSFLASH....,"Diane Krall cannot SING!!! I was at a party and they were playing this CD it is relatively new and it was played like it was the only cd they had. The musicality and artistry that is portrayed through her piano is extraordinary...then unfortunately, she opens her mouth, which sounds watereddown, gargled like a saxophone with duct tape over the bell opening. ""Just the way you are"" is a studio version done on the cd with Michael Brecker and Christian McBride, incredible musically, but then luckily we all know the words because the lyrics by Krall don't break thru the gargling...."
5,The best to Diana Krall,"I've got to admit that most of the CD's I've bought lately put me to sleep. Diana Krall~""Live in Paris"" is thrilling! I sang vocals in my jazz choir in high school and so I appreciate the upbeat vocals in this collection. Every song is a hit or made to sound like Diana has made it her own. Ella and Etta make room in the hall of fame. My favorites are ""I've Got You Under My Skin"", ""The Look of Love"", and ""Just the Way You Are"". But, I really like the whole CD a lot. Jazz in Paris lives."
5,Great jazz concert and superb sound. The best from Diana Krall to date.,Extraordinary concert. Superb recording. 180 gram vinyl sounds amazing. This is one of my best sounding vinyl records. I think this is the best record from Diana Krall. I prefer it over any studio record she has made. Her performance as a singer and pianist is exceptional.
4,Her voice is husky and cool,"The first time I listened to her voice, I could not really match her voice with how she looks. She is a pretty woman. But her voice is husky and cool. I youtubed her and saw some video clips of ""Live in Paris"" and other performance videos. I've noticed that she often performs with a very talented bassist John Clayton. He is awesome. People rave about Diana but I have to say that John and other artists who performed with Diana are cool too. I think I am going to check out John's new project through ArtistShare. It is supposed to be a family project."
2,a good overview of early hawkwind,the sound quality ranges from good to very good but the tunes say it all . kind of like boc meets the floyd but totally original and brain numbing ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK YOULL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN !!!
5,"Fascinating, informative, insightful, highly recommended.","Jeremy Kagan's Directors Up Close is a compendium of engaging, informative, insightful interviews with film directors who were each nominated for ""Best Film"" by the Directors Guild of America. A highly recommended addition to any academic, professional, and community library film studies collection, Directors Up Close is a fascinating and informative work will entertain film buffs, educate film school students, and tutor aspiring directors."
4,Up Close and Personal as Part of a Black Regiment,"In 1862 Thomas Wentworth Higginson was commissioned as a colonel in the Union Army and assigned to train emancipated slaves to become soldiers. He did so on the Sea Islands off the coast of the Carolinas. This is his story.His accounts of traveling up the St. Johns and St. Mary's Rivers during the war with his regiment were thrilling but the best chapter in my opinion was about his own personal decision to swim to the Confederate lines at night, naked, to scout out their positions. The chapter is entitled ""A Night in the Water."" It is gripping stuff.The narrative has its ups and downs, but overall, this is well worth reading."
3,Title is misleading,"The title implies it uncovers biblical myths and deceptions, and it does a fairly good job at that at times.That is an easy enough task. The problem I have is that Mr. Graham, on one hand, dismisses the bible as ludicrous second hand myths, and then on the other hand uses the same myth to support his own theories, most of which are even more bizzare than christianity. Overall it is well written, but I found myself skipping entire paragraphs to get passed all of Mr Grahams metaphysical tailchasing. If you are looking for a bible expose', there are better ones out there. Also I might add, Mr. Graham does little to provide documentation to support his own theories."
2,"Thought provoking, but the mysticism made for a dull read","The book was thought provoking, but did not provide references to check. The occasional anti-semitic remarks were somewhat bothersome and all the mystical nonsense led me to think that the author himself is very superstitious. However, the book provided me with leads which I can check myself so that I can reach my own conclusions regarding the validity of the Bible.For instance, I have always suspected that many parts of the Judeo-Christian religion were ""borrowed"" from some other religion or culture. The author implies this but does not back up his claims with references. There are a few names and titles of books sprinkled here and there, but not a proper bibliography.Additionally, I recommend that the author take a few more courses in the scientific disciplines."
1,A crackpot work,"Lloyd Graham rails against people who unquestioningly believe the Bible, yet expects us to accept his system of ""Causation"" on faith. He bases his whole work on this system, which is not backed up by solid scholarship. He implies that priests invented religion out of the blue and then wrote the Bible in order to force their invention on other people. His dates for various events are questionable and his etymologies of names are often twisted to produce the desired meaning. Worst of all, anti-Semitic remarks appear every so often throughout the book. Read it if you enjoy mentally arguing with authors, but don't take it seriously."
1,"Ad hoc, specious arguments, rambling and unpersuasive.","Bought the book expecting a learned, rational discussion based on solid scholarship; found everything but. This agnostic was saddened and a bit concerned that tripe of this kind actually made it into print. If you're looking for rational scholarship, look elsewhere."
1,Deceptions and Myths of the Bible,"Mr. Graham's book, Deceptions and Myths of the Bible is both a deception and a myth. Mr. Graham shows little knowledge of Theology or elementary earth science. This book consists mostly of building straw men and then knocking them down. Though a reproof of the Bible and Christians, Mr. Graham uses both Christians and the Bible as references when he feels they help make his case. Where did Mr. Graham get his knowledge? Who knows. The work is greatly lacking in supporting documentation. What few footnotes that are there are very obscure. It takes too much faith to believe any of this stuff."
2,an afterthought,"If you are looking for a book of this type, I just read ""The book your church doesn't want you to read"" by Tim C. Leedom, and found it far superior to this one....not written with the seething contempt as this one, and leaves the reader to draw his own conclusions instead of presenting this bizzare Causation as truth."
2,lack of reference about the author and sources looses value,Any given critical study demands references as well as a brief summation of the writer's background.This book provides none of the above and therefore fails to bring authority to the arguments presented by the writer.
2,Can't read to children,"My husband bought this to read to our daughter but after reading it first, we decided it wasn't a good book to share. Squirrel Nutkin annoys the owl that allows the other squirrels to gather nuts in his area, then he attacks the owl and the owl pins Squirrel Nutkin down. When Squirrel Nutkin escapes, he rips his tail in half and now he lives as a pissed off squirrel. The end."
1,Violence is not the answer,I was offended and disturbed by the sudden and swift use of violence to teach Squirrel a lesson. There are more effective ways to teach children the value of work and teamplay.
4,The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin,"The story is a tale of a curious squirrel, Nutkin, who does not follow the other squirrels' lead of providing gifts to Mr. Brown, the owl. Due to his improper manners with Mr. Brown, Nutkin finds himself in an uneasy situation. This is a good book for older readers. The illustrations also are very colorful."
5,Buckey O'Neill,"After watching the movie""Rough Riders"" my interest in the real Buckey O'Neill became acute. This book intices me to Arizona, even though I am a Texas gal, to see the places where he lived and worked. Anyone interested in a true story of an exemplary frontiersman, should read the book."
4,be careful,this is for the 350cc. i didn't realize this when i ordered (i have a 250) but i am hopeful it will be OK for most maintenance
2,"No.4 is super, No.2 is terrible sounds","I really expected to listen to this DVD. However, it was deep disappointment. Furtwanlger's conduct is excellent and dynamics of the music is amazingly vivid. However, the recording situation of No.2 is terrible!!! I do not understand why did the company sell such a terrible recording sound to the public market!! It must be recalled and reimbursed to all costomers who bought this DVD. But Beethoven's No. 4 is excellent in terms of both recording sound and playing."
4,What About Me?,"The book I read What About Me? was a good book. It's about a 15 year old girl named Dorrie who has an 11 year old brother, Fredlet, who is menatally challenged. He annoys Dorrie and sometimes she doesn't think before she yells at him. Dorrie's not happy with her life because she says her parents only pay attention to Fredlet. Her family wants to move to Maryland for Fredlet and her dad wants a job there. She gets to stay in New York City with her neighbor.Dorrie's character has a lot of meaning. There are times where you can think she is stubborn and self-centered. There are also times when she can seem so caring when she's taking care of Fredlet. Fredlet has his own little world. There are things he says or does that only he knows and they are unexplainable. You try to figure him out but only he knows. This is what makes him such an interesting character. I think you should read this book and see what happens."
1,A Stinker,"I am sorry, but I really didn't like this book at all. The book is written with the protagonist Dorrie as the narrator. Suffering from adolescent angst, Dorrie resents her brother Fred. Fred has Down Syndrome and has the ridiculous nickname of Fredlet. The story plods along with Dorrie's whining voice and the ending is certainly neither a surprise nor a resolution of the story.On the plus side, it is not the standard formulaic plot, but I still didn't like Dorrie or the story."
4,Walking in Divine Health,"My opinion on this book was great! It is full of valuable information, ideas, things you should know and do and what to avoid. The author came from a spiritual aspect and shared how to avoid cancer and heart disease, how to combat it if you have it, and how we get it, as well as staying fit and eating to good health. I have recommended it to many people who have picked it up and are reading it."
2,somewhat disappointing,I thought this book would have more of a spiritual focus and it was more nutritionally based. I was looking for a more clear tie between nutrition and God's Word.
4,Good Album,A good album featuring two great guitarists. I enjoy great guitar music and this album did not disappoint.
2,Pretty but beat-up,The roses that I received were pretty but some of the outter petals where turning brown due to bruising during shipment.
4,Great but flawed recording of Ballo,"I agree with the earlier reviewer that it is amazing this fine recording had no previous reviews to his. I agree with the bulk of the earlier review-you are hearing Gigli, one the great voices of the 20th century, in his prime in one of his finest roles and two great singers on their way up. The fly in the ointment is the soprano, Caniglia. One has to feel sorry for the soprano who was interviewed in retirement and said that ""Gigli sounded the way he sounded on stage and I did not."" If one wants just one recording of this opera, go with the Pavarotti recording, one of his best."
4,Rags To Riches To Rags - Very Funny and Heartwarming,This is such a funny movie. Woody Allen and his partners in crime play up their bumbling idiot characters so well! Tracey Ullman is a genius - She can play any character and make it believable.This rags to riches to rags story is funny and heartwarming and just fun to watch. This was also the first time I saw Hugh Grant playing such a loathsome character - he was great! What can I say about Elaine May except she is so good that it looks like she's not even acting!The comedic acting was very good in this movie and I can't wait to own it on DVD so I can sit back and enjoy over and over again.
3,"Fun, But Not Vintage Woody","Woody Allen is in fine form in this uneven comedy that features a fabulous cast (typical for an Allen film)including Tracy Ullman, Hugh Grant, Jon Lovitz, Elaine Stritch and Elaine May. Lower class con artists (Allen & Ullman) strike it rich, lose it all and find one another all over again in this goofy romantic comedy. Ullman is particularly fine as the brassy, uncouth wife who falls prey to Grant's slithering opportunistic rich boy. Elaine May, however, walks away with the film as Ullman's daffy, kind hearted sister, May. This is nowhere nearly as good as Allen's previous work, but it's still fun with many stand out moments that are worth the price of a Blockbuster rental."
4,Old Woody,"Back to the old Woody Allen this movie is extremely clever and witty. However, it plays in mono dolby digital. This one can be viewed on any system since it's appeal is the ""Woody wit of old"" not the sound."
5,Small Time Crooks has big-time laughs,"Woody Allen plays an inept ex-con who has a scheme for breaking into a bank. He plans to buy a store which is adjacent to the bank and then to make an underground tunnel to the bank vault. When he asks his wife, played by Tracey Ullman, to help finance the project, she balks. Eventually she gives in and becomes his ""front man"" by baking cookies in the store they buy. The cookies become unbelievably successful and suddenly they are richer than in their wildest dreams. Tracey decides that she must become more cultured to fit into their new social set and she asks an art dealer, played by Hugh Grant, to tutor her in the social graces. This he does willingly with an eye to cashing in on her fortune. This movie is well-written and well-acted. The lines are witty and there is even a moral here with regard to love and loyalty. No Woody Allen darkness here--just a delightful 90-minute romp!"
2,It's not funny.,"This is not a funny movie by Allen. The good part is that he really tried to make something light, enjoyable, happy ending, not using instrospectiveness all the time. Also, Allen himseld says, on the DVD extrar, that the main reason for the success of this movie was that Dreamworks promoted it with energy, a thing that seldom occurred before.There are simply not enough jokes here. You'll feel comforable watching it, but not laughing. Two-third of the csat disappears before the middle of the movie (Michael Rapaport and Levitz), and at least we get an Elain May in top form.This is more like a ""study"" than a real movie by Allen."
3,Some Definite Chuckles,"Small Time Crooks is not classic Woody, but it certainly isn't pretentious or boring. The plot is fantastic and it's hard to suspend disbelief but a lot of the jokes here work. It's hard to say the same thing about his other recent releases, however. I would say that, as a director, Allen's been in full-fledged decline since Husbands and Wives, but this movie is small in scale and accomplishes its task. I like Tracey Ullman and thought she excelled in her role. Allen's script dances on the tightrope between condescension and humor in regards to these characters but in the end obtains respectable results."
3,"It's Funny, It's Charming,It Must Be 1975!","A return to 1970s form for Woody Allen? No, it's just a return to his 1970s idiom, the broad, New York comedy, albeit revised and refined a little since those days. The casting of this director can sometimes seem repetitive, as we see the same faces appear again and again in his films, however he manages to inject new life here with Tracey Ullman and Hugh Grant, neither of whom is exactly challenged by the material. But it's good fun. You see Allen waving his hands about in parallel whilst talking about his neuroses, and there's a crime of the century caper plot to keep the jokes coming. The real casting question is, how long can Allen continue to play the slightly nerdy, romantically unfulfilled intellectual he was playing when he was twenty. I think you know the answer!"
2,"Small Time Crooks, Small Time Comedy","Woody Allen is seldom bad, but even he cannot overcome a repetitive series of ethnic joke sequences and a monotonous script. At first, one is almost waiting for the burlesque drum ""thump"" at the end of the obvious gags, but after the third or fourth time one wonders when something new is going to happen. The plot is thin and implausible while not really being funny. The concluding half hour has a canned, almost desperate-to-finish quality. Don't buy this movie before renting it."
2,Woody Allen's second-worst,"The first 30 minutes or so are fun. After that, ""Small Time Crooks"" becomes a terrible embarrassment. It does not mark a return to his early comedies; it marks the loss of all the humor and wit that has characterized his writing and filmmaking since the beginning. I am a big Woody Allen fan. I've seen every film he's directed (except ""September,"" ""Another Woman,"" and ""Shadows and Fog"") and I've enjoyed all of them but ""What's Up, Tiger Lily?"" (which Woody himself tried to disown almost as soon as he was done with it). ""Small Time Crooks"" is his worst film ever, hands down. Rather, it WAS his worst film ever, until the painful ""Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" came along."
3,Take the Money and......,"Everyone I hope recognizes that, if one lives long enough, that one is bound to start recycling ideas. That is the case here with Woody Allen's partial revival of his early film classic Take the Money and Run, with a class twist. Here Roy (Allen's character) is just as dimwitted as old Virgil of Take the Money but as an older and wiser man he knows when to quit (for a while anyway). So when Roy and his associates' attempted bank robbery is foiled by his bugling his wife's successful cookie shop cover operation sees them through the rough spots, again for a while. After a trip through the wilds of bourgeois New York the couple, after some disasters personal and financial, go back to the old tricks of the trade. I am not altogether sure what this says about class mobility in a democratic society but Roy please do not call me for your next caper. Funny, in Allen's slapstick way, in spots but not his best in this genre."
3,"A good movie, but..","I love Woody Allen. This movie was a typical Woody Allen movie. I thought the movie was good, but predictable and I thought Woody Allen fit the part perfectly. I do, however, think the movie would have been better if Woody Allen was younger or his castmates were older. I'm not saying I hated the movie or saying that people shouldn't see it, if they're fans of Woody Allen, they should. I'm just saying that I think more could have done with the plot than was done."
3,An Enjoyable Comedy,"I really have enjoyed all of Woody Allen's movies. This is no exception. Small Time Crooks is a small movie about a group of individuals who plan to rob a bank by tunneling underground from a pizza shop turned cookie bakery. That scheme goes arye, but their cookies sell like hot-cakes. It is a very funny movie that stars Michael Rapaport, Jon Lovitz, Tracey Ulman, and Hugh Grant. In my opinion Tracey Ullman steals the show with her witty funny self. But anyone who enjoys Woody Allen's movies should see this one. Believe me, it's worth it."
3,Hilarious! Witty!,"This movie very funny, although it got 3 stars because it is clear that the movie completely changes from the first half-hour."
4,laugh out louder!,This movie made me laugh out loud. more in the beginning than the end but still. Woody Allen really is a comedy genius. he and tracy ullman really clicked as a pair. This movie definetly is worth the time and I wouldn't mind adding it to my collection either.
2,Awful,"I've seen nearly all of Woody Allen's films & consider myself a huge fan, but this was a huge letdown....even by the standards of lightweight comedy it's disappointing. Except for a couple of scattered scenes, nothing here displays Woody's typical wit and insightfulness. The characters are cartoonish and unlikable, and the production is flashy and garish. Even comparing Small Time Crooks to other recent films of Allen's (let alone his masterpieces of the 70s & 80s...you know which ones), there's none of the fun found in Bullets over Broadway and Mighty Aphrodite, the dark wit found in Deconstructing Harry, or the quiet soulfulness of Sweet & Lowdown. If you must see this one, rent it--definitely not one to buy."
1,"This is your wallet speaking, save your money!!","This DVD was so wonderful I and everyone watching it, fell asleep 45 thrilling minutes into it. I am a huge fan of both Jon Lovitz and Michael Rappaport, and was expecting this to be a good old fashioned comedy without all of the sexual preversion found in many recent comedies. I was wrong, it wasn't even a comedy. It was an extremely annoying movie being that Woody Allen talks the entire time, and never shuts up long enough for anyone to get a word in edgewise. I have seen and enjoyed other Woody Allen movies, but not this one. I would strongly suggest that you keep your money and spend it elsewhere."
4,IJN SHIPS' ENDINGS,"This book contains handwritten notes (in English) by an IJN Constructor Lt Cdr., setting out which IJN ships survived WW2, and what became of them. Ships' particulars are also included.This book is a very valuable semi-technical record of what ships survived, and gives a further insight into the incredible catastrophe which befell a proud nation. The narrative does not go into much detail as to how the ships ended up where they did, and offers little in the way of opinion. But it is very rich in technical facts!The appendix contains some rarely seen B&W; photos.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone having a serious interest in the history of the IJN, as it provides a sensible rounding out of the subject."
5,I need a HERO!!,"This is the sequel to Susan Kearney's Bordering On Obession. Do you remember the spunky assistant to Quinn in Bordering On Obession? This book marks the return of Kimberly. Kimberly is in Europe looking to add in the sex scenes for her movie script and Jason Parker is there to give a ""helping"" hand (literally ;)I don't want to give away the story...but if you like adventure mixed with a little spice and romance then this book is for you."
3,From Back Cover,"Kimberly Hayward was a stickler for the details in her action-adventure script. She'd checked out every heist -- and murder! -- for authenticity. Now she had to inject some more sizzle into the love scenes. Who better to help with some ""hands-on"" research than the mysterious but sexy Jason Parker?Field agent Jason had never tackled an assignment like this -- tail a gorgeous blonde who seemed to be up to something suspicious. And he was certain the case didn't involve indulging in sexual fantasies with Kimberly, but who could resist? She seduced him one night -- and even took notes, strangely enough!No question, their unfolding relationship was hot, explosive...obsessive. But what happened next wasn't even in the script...[4th in the Heros, Inc series; sequel to Bordering on Obsession.]"
4,Probably the best overall Italian sung Aida,"The only other Aida that projects most of the musical quality present in the work is the German language version from mid 50's Vienna with Kubelik conducting.This recording is a standout primarily because of the uniform quality of the singers, Pasero especially. Italian opera is extremely vocally dependant; if the singers can't do the job (and nowadays, they usually don't) the performance simply will not work. I suppose that's one reason why I've always preferred Wagner to Verdi. If the singers are a bit deficient, the music, story and dramatic sweep carries you away and you leave the performance with some feeling of fulfillment.I normally don't find myself saying this, but I actually enjoy listening to this recording. Although the story is the usual Italian opera overly sentimental pap, the quality and commitment of the performance is good enough for me to tolerate it at least temporarily."
4,Great tool to help you learn...,iPhones seemed complicated to me. I felt aprehensive about the switch from my current smart phone to the iPhone because I thought it would take me forever to learn how to navigate it... then I found this DVD. What a simple way to learn! It cut the learning curve in half!
3,Not the best collection,"Go out and grab the first two albums if you're able. This collection of really isn't the best representation of Cockney Rejects. It's missing such greats as East End. And as all you West Ham fans know, it lacks their rendition of Forever Blowing Bubbles."
3,Not their best,"I really hate it when people say things like ""The band Sham 69 was supposs to be."" No offense guy, but which ever music critic first came up with that one is an idiot. Sham 69 were never ""Supposs"" to be anything. They were a great legendary punk band. Period! The Cockney Rejects always have been and always will be second rate when compared to Sham 69 in their heyday. Although the Cockney Rejects do have some great songs, this cd is hardly representative of that. Stick to ""Greatest Hits Vol. one"" and ""Vol. Two"", and you will have all the Rejects you could ever need. For completeists only."
5,Superb Film !! Don't Miss Out !!,A wonderful adaptation of this memorable & tragic story by Hardy. It is casted well and remains true to the author's work. I would highly recommend this film as an addition to your collection of great films.
4,A man tormented,"If you are in the mood for serious story telling, this adaptation of a Thomas Hardy Classic will easily fit the bill. The Mayor of Casterbridge gives a compelling look into the life of a reformed alcoholic. Ciaran Hinds in every way masters the range of emotion and intensity needed to convey the essence of Michael Henshard. James Purfoy as his friend soon becomes a target for Henshard's demons. These two were later teamed up once again in HBO's epic ROME. Polly Walker also plays important women in both stories. Enjoy."
3,He's a dog,"Good film, characters play very well and the story line kept my interest from beginning to end. What else can you ask of a film?"
3,A big letdown,"I really enjoyed Ciaran Hinds in Pride and Prejudice, and read about his illustrious career on Wikipedia, so I purchased this movie as I am also a Hardy fan. But I was extremely disappointed with the acting and cinematography in this movie. The feigned accents were over the top, too. And no captions, either, so I could only understand 1 out of 5 words."
1,No Closed Caption or Subtitles - Shame on You!,"When will film and TV distributors recognize that there is a growing audience of viewers that require either closed caption and/or Subtitles for Home Viewing? They are capricious to discriminate against those who have a physical impairment that is not of their own doing. In fact, I would be so bold to suggest that Amazon (and others selling Video Products of this nature) BOLDLY LABEL these products as either friendly or non-friendly to the hearing impaired."
3,Fatal Flaw,"A most excellent production with one fatal flaw - no CC or subtitles. The English accents are very heavy and hard to decipher in many of the scenes. Nevertheless, I recommend the movie simply because the all-star cast and the acting are so superb. You just need to listen very carefully and try to fill in the blanks when you can't understand all they are saying. I would love to buy another copy of this production, if A&E would re-release it with subtitles. P.S., I could make the very same comments about A&E's production of another famous Thomas Hardy story, Tess of the d'Urbervilles."
1,Boring,"Being a fan of this type of literature, I couldn't wait to watch this. But I hadn't read the book. About 15 minutes into it, I couldn't stand the boredom and never finished watching the movie.However, if you are a fan of the book and a Thomas Hardy fan, it's probably a must for your collection."
4,An excellent film and adaptation,"While many adaptations suffer from over-emphasizing the costumes and scenes at the expense of great acting, or from taking too much license in editing or adapting a story, this film combines wonderful cinema with a good period feel. The acting is fine, the landscapes are beautiful, and the scenes seem ""natural"".Moreover, this is a great story, full of emotion, difficulties, and cultural relevance. Set (and written) in England during the latter half of the nineteenth century, many of the emerging topics of the day (changes in technology or social roles, for example) are brought into the story.While a shorter adaptation than the 1978 mini-series, this film is definitely worth viewing if you are a fan of Thomas Hardy and/or nineteenth century (particularly British) literature."
4,"Vanity, vanity","Ciarán Hinds and Juliet Aubrey never disappoint. James Purefoy was excellent in his part. I did not like Jodhi May in this particular role, but the production is compelling."
4,Captivating and Heart Wrenching,"This movie has all the right ingredients for a great English movie, that is, until the bitter end. The trials and story lines captivated my heart because of the hope, love and the beautiful dream (turned tough reality). But it still flowered wonderfully, that is, until just about the end. The ending wrenched the very hope, love and softness from the human condition, so much so, that it caused me to walk away from it feeling drained. If you are a hopeless romantic or love a proper balance of pain and pleasure, then this one is for you. With just a few small changes at the end, it could have been a glorious 5 stars and been worth glowing over. In the long run.....I can still recommend this film: as a good one."
1,Lack of subtitles is a disappointment.,"I would love to own this DVD because of Ciaran Hinds whom I admire greatly, but the above description of the production says nothing about sub-titles, so it would be of little use to me. I can hear well, but have trouble understanding the dialogue. So A&E has lost another sale here!"
1,No Emotion--Don't waste your time and money,"I have watched both the A&E and the BBC production of this movie after reading the book. I must say that the A&E leaves much to be desired. Had I not read the book, I would not have understood all that was going on as far as feelings between the father and daughter--very bland. No emotion between the two main characters. In the BBC production, you were pulled into the very hearts of the father and daughter--acting was super!! If you want to see this film and get the true story, don't waste you money on the A&E. Get the BBC production. I'm glad I did!"
2,pietrp 3,A low rate because of the lack of the subtitles who helps to undestand foreign people not so accustomed with spoken english
1,So not good.,"Dull dull, dull and too depressing. I'm giving it away for Trick or Treat. I love Ciaran Hinds but he has done better movies than this--a waste of his talent!!"
1,disapointing,I was not happy with this movie. I must have had the wrong expectations because I was so angry when it was over. If you want a good movie with a wonderful normal ending don't watch this. I suppose the man got what he deserved but I still wanted the sappy expected ending where everyone is happy
2,Another Mediocre American Production!,"I am disappointed in this A & E movie, especially after watching John Schlesinger's amazing film adaptation of Hardy's Far From the Madding Crowd. If only the Mayor of Casterbridge would enunciate his words carefully! The performances in this movie are average and the entire production bears the unmistakable stamp of contemporary American mediocrity!"
5,Triathlon training in four hours a week,I love this book.It has everything you need to know about training for a triathlon.It is easy to understand and follow and very inspirational.
4,Great 1st Tri manual,"I just finished my first triathlon this month, used this book to get me started and keep me motivated. It has different training levels for different people, great workouts and stretches, even advice for what to eat while training. There's also a bunch of inspirational stories and reminders which are very helpful for novices. Great raceday tips and checklists too! Like some of the other readers, I used this book to get me started and now i'm searching for more triathlons!"
5,Motivational!,The first chapter alone motivated me to do another triathlon! I enjoyed the simplicity of the exercies and suggestions. Enjoy!
2,misleading planning & time frames for a beginner,"unfortunately, the magical transformation of the author into a competitive athlete is a unique event, not one that readers will replicate easily (or ever!), especially following the plans inside.the author ignores the base building necessary to race the events. athletes need to train their musculoskeletal structure to take the abuse of workouts as much as they need to get their hearts up to speed. this is best done slowly and incrementally. i think if you have been a regular athlete for at least a year before using the plan in this book, you may be fine.if you are beginning in any of the three sports, i'd advise another book to show the real process of developing the appropriate base needed to compete without injury. Look up the titles by Joe Friel for more complete information on how to structure a training plan."
4,Definately what you need to get started,"Doesn't cover all the details you need to know, but does cover the basic's and gives you a plan to follow which is very important. If you are not a strong swimmer you will need to find extra resources for help in addtion to this book.(total immersion stuff(videos) were good) I just completed my first triathlon using the workout plans in this book, and was able to finish no problem. I would recommend to anybody."
3,lacking in training plan depth,"I found this book to be a little dated, which makes the section on gear irrelevant. Additionally, with access to free advice on the web, I was disappointed by the lack of depth in the training program. Save your money, search online, maybe sign-up for a web-based coaching program. Cost is about the same."
3,Not exactly what I'd hoped for...,"This book was more like a motivational speech rather than a how-to for training for a first triathlon. There are some helpful tips, such as a very general outline for weekly workouts, equipment you need to bring to the event, and an introduction to some triathlon training terminology. Other than that, it was mostly motivational fluff. A nice light read, this book is good for someone contemplating signing up for a race. However, if you've already signed up for, or completed, your first race, you're already beyond this book. I would look elsewhere to actually prepare for competition."
3,decent beginners guide,This book will give the absolute beginner a hand in laying the groundwork for triathlon. Not much more.
5,Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week,I have really enjoyed reading this book. Not only is it helpful in training but there are inspirational highlights within the text.
2,Don't waste your money,"I have an original. This is just another cheap knock off (even though it's from Gibson) that can't compare. Doesn't play the same, doesn't sound the same. Do yourself a favor a start hunting garage sales and the likes. It may take you a year or two but you'll be happier with an original TV Les Paul Junior or a early 60's model. The wait is worth it. I paid $350.00 for mine back in 2002 Good Luck."
5,Great Film!,"This a great war film as far as I am concerned. A fact that is overlooked by most is that the ""Technical Advisor"" was Mike Hoare (SP?) who was one of the most famous (notorious to some?) mercenaries of the 20th century. If you read about Hoare, it becomes apparent that this fictional film is probably not that far from the truth of one of many of Mike Hoare's real life adventures! To read more about Mike Hoare, I suggest wikipedia and Solder Of Fortune magazine www.SOFmag.com).."
3,Great B grade movie,"The transfer is vastly better than the really bad DVD. Why only 3 stars? No subtitles for the hearing impaired and those to whom English is a second language of which there are tens of millions in region A! This is even more disgraceful as the UK release which is locked to region B has excellent subtitles but crappy extras. This release has much better extras. A real mix up, it could have been such good value but in the end has shot itself in the foot, a bit like some of the cast in the film!!"
3,Adventure,"This tale is woven from some real charactors who have worked as mercenaries in Africa. I am a former SF Paratrooper and I have known some people who were very much like these charactors in this DVD so it rings true, for me at least. Still it is fictional but entertaining. I enjoyed it."
2,Wild Geese,"I first saw this film in the theaters when it was released in 1978. I thought it was great. I was excited to see it on dvd at the movie rental store and decided to check it out once more. Sadly, it doesn't stand the test of time. While the cast is terrific, they just couldn't rise above a lukewarm script and a shoddy production. The action sequences are so staged looking that I felt like I was watching a youtube video.I was surprised to learn that the producer had worked on The Guns of Navarone. Now that's a movie that stands up. If you want a good military adventure, check out Navarone or Where Eagles Dare (also starring Richard Burton) or Uncommon Valor (with the great Gene Hackman)."
1,Unwatchable Garbage,"This, like most Andrew McLaglen films is crap. As a matter of fact the only film I can think to compare this to is the Sea Wolves (starring Gregory Peck and David Niven and also ruined ...erm ""directed"" by the afore-mentioned McLaglen) which is equally awful and has an equally brilliant but ultimately wasted cast. Please do yourself a favor and skip this. I believe the majority of positive reviews are nostalgia based. This movie seriously sucks."
3,"4:3 Letterbox DVD, not Widescreen? What the....?","This is one of my favorite movies, and I wasn't expecting great quality, so that the video quality looks more like VHS, than DVD, isn't a huge shock - I wasn't exactly expecting a 'Lawrence of Arabia' quality transfer.But, this is a letterboxed movie, shown in 4:3 aspect ratio, _not_ a widescreen DVD. So, you if you have a 16:9 screen, you get the bars on either side of the image, then you get the black bars on the top and bottom. Not so great...On my Panasonic 42"" plasma, I get the gray bars on either side when I select 4:3, then of course the movie is letterboxed, so then I get black bars on top and bottom also. I can zoom in on the image, which presumably is what that mode is for, but then the image quality really starts to suffer."
4,Nice genre piece,Not a classic but a forerunner of Lord of War and The Constant Gardner in that it shows the unprincipled meddling of Big Business in the Third World.
3,FINALLY!,"""The Wild Geese"" ain't ""The Wild Bunch"", but as the old man at the end of the Wild Bunch says - ""it'll do"".I first saw this when I was 13 on TV back in the eighties, then uncut on VHS from Blockbuster Video when I was attending Howard University in the early 90s, and now as an adult, it has not missed a beat, nor diminished in anyway. All the scenes I remember liking back as a kid, were still fresh, and some of the witty lines now don't go over my head.This is not the best movie in the world. But its waaaay better than modern movies that seem to be modelled after it ""Proof of Life"" with Russell Crowe and of course ""Tears of the Sun"".Richard Burton and Richard Harris were both reported to be drunks at the time. But even if they were sober it wouldn't have helped. The movie is good the way it is. I'm just so happy its finally on DVD!Enjoy!"
5,The Wild Geese,"For those who are fans of ""War/Mercenary Theme"" tales, The Wild Geese is a classic. Outstanding Stars, outstanding actions, outstanding music. It is an action packed story of men, a nations' adversities from within, and the steps taken to relieve the strife. In the guise of securing freedom for a deposed and incarcerated leader and re-establishing a democracratic free state, mercenaries are hired and sent on a mission into catastrophe. The mercenaries and freed leader are used as pawns in mineral rights schemes between a greedy English Lord and the ruling despot. The mercenary unit and the now freed leader are left stranded when their plane to safety passes them by. Now pursued, the relationships of men, ideals, and their need to survive, demonstrate the power and will that mens' hearts can muster when the real needs are the life of this leader and the freedom of his people. Retribution by the surviving mercenaries is methodical and thorough. Not a movie for to be taken lightly."
1,Oh dear,"We weren't expecting much from this one. My husband remembered it as not being great, but being tolerable. I think he was interested in the weapons in the program.Anyway, even my husband could only get through the first five minutes. The writing is spectacularly bad. It's kind of funny in that Richard Burton clearly is drunk/hungover and hates the script as much as we do. He's practically rolling his eyes as he recites his lines.You should only buy this if you're interested in collecting the world's worst films featuring the world's best actors."
4,The Wild Geese,"A film full of action, but regretably, as in most of Burton's films, he over acted! Richard Harris and Roger Moore gave great performances and certainly brought out the atmosphere that prevails in the African countries these days.The political undercurrent portayed by these ""Soldiers of Fortune"" adventures, always provides for great entertainment, and in this case definitely a film worth watching.Good to see, while only briefly, the appearance of Stewart Granger again--I always thought he was completely under estimated!"
3,A question for the author,"To Richard Zimler: You begin your book with a foward in which you thank a number of people. Continuing with the first chapter you describe the discovery of a manuscript. Our book club just read your work and in our discussion we had quite a debate on whether or not the manuscript was truly a ""discovery"" or whether this was the author's liberty in a work of fiction. Is there any truth to the discovery of the manuscript?"
2,Interesting plot but not well written,"It is As If the premise of this book licensed the author to write a book badly and with more As If's than humanly possible on one page. Unfortunately, I had recently completed ""Where She Has Gone"" by Nino Rici. It also suffers from the As If problem. One particular page of The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon contained over eight As If phrases. I found the author's lack of verbal imagination distressing. The plot is interesting and my need to know who did it kept me reading. I do wonder about the historical authenticity of nude and lascivious blacksmith's in the 1500's. Read ""Tuesday's with Morrie"" instead."
1,Agonizingly slow,"I just finished Last Kabbalist and it was a chore to do so. The dialogue was amateurishly written and I found that I really didn't care at all about any of the characters. I AM a kabbalistic Jew and bought the book full of anticipation. After the first chapter, however, I proceeded with what could best be decribed as a dogged determination. I had to finish it to see if it ever got any better. Unfortunately, it never did. I finished it with nothing more than regret for the time I wasted in reading it. Not recommended."
2,annoying grammatical idiosyncresies,"I thought that Zimler did a great job giving shape to the times and places, HOWEVER . . . his use of passive verbs and especially the overuse of ""was gifted with"" just drove me nuts. I speak Hebrew and know enough Portugese to know that it is not some poetic translation of an idiom in either language. His Hebrew transliterations were sometimes unrecognizable (I'm still puzzled by a few). I found the voices of all the ""bad guys"" to be the same. This made me often have to stop and refigure out who was who. The unravelling of the mystery is rather muddy and just not interesting. The use of Farid as a human crime lab with ""black butterfly eyelashes"" was a bit of a stretch. In conclusion, texture and times: good job. Dialog internal and voiced: irritating"
4,Writing Excellent / Condition of Bk not so much,"This is a honest and therefore horrible at times glimpse into Portugal in the early 16th century, amidst terrible poverty, plague and the Inquisition from the perspective of the nephew and student of a prominent Kabbalist of Lisbon. Based as it is on an actual journal which was unearthed only recently, I highly recommend this book."
1,Not recommended,"I was looking forward to reading this book because I enjoy historical mysteries like Eco's Name of the Rose and Pear's An Instance of the Fingerpost. This book was not successful, however. As history, it was a cartoon. The only bad Jews are the ones who have converted to Christianity and the only good Christians are the ones who, it turns out, are actually Jews. As far as the mystery is concerned, I found it incomprehensible. Having finished the book, I still have only the vaguest notion of who the killer is and no idea at all of the motive."
3,"Not so bad, but not so good","The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon was neither a thriller, nor very educational about the history of Lisbon's Jews, nor was it very much about kabbalah. Rather, it scratched the surface of all three. My advice is, read a book about kabbalah, a book about the History of Jews in Europe, and a book by Agatha Christie or someone. While it might take you three times as long to get through the books, one would learn 10 times as much. Dont get me wrong, The Last Kabbalist is not garbage, but you wont find yourself thinking about the story while day dreaming on the elevator."
4,Very good but ...,"Pros: A good historical and mystery novel teinted by the threat and blood of religious persecutions. Full of emotions, colors and parfums, one can picture, if not yet known the sepharadic world.Cons: The constraints of the initial manuscript itself which chalenged as much the writer as his readers (who can sometimes loose track). The end is pending, and doesn't really makes sense.Conclusion: The curiosity makes us want to read the original document, but this would take away the fiction from the story."
3,Great history- confusing story,"Just completed the Last Kabbalist of Lisbon and though fascinated with the history I found it a rather confusing who -done-it and why? But perhaps that's not really the point of the book, which is rich in history, poetry and texture. I thorougly enjoyed the book- even the very gruesome bits and I learnt alot."
2,Too much effort required,"I made it all the way through this novel, but in general it requires too much effort from the reader. There are too many characters and -- especially -- too many plot twists to keep track of. If I'm going to expend this much mental effort on a novel, it had better be a classic worthy of that effort. This novel is not such a book."
5,excellent collection,"Rebecca Clarke (1886-1979)was a great composer, and this recording is an excellent example of her work. Highly recommended."
2,Over-Rated,"I've been shaving my head ""traditionally"" for years, stumbled across this product on the internet and decided to give it try. Yes it does provide a less irritating shave, but i could do a better job with a boxcutter. Shaved exactly as the directions state and still had to go over many areas two to three times and still didnt get a close shave. In my opinion it's not worth the price. Go buy a good 4 or 5 blade razor instead."
1,Ouch! ...I'm bleeding.,"All show and no go - that's the best description. It' s just a gimmick. I used it for quite some time to try different techniques and different style blades. Each time it left parts of my head with long stubble, even after repeated swipes. This made for an extra long, extra unproductive shaving session.Then the blood... When it cuts (which it does a lot, especially in the back), it cuts deep - which tends to reopen the next time you shave. I finally had to take time off to heal before retrying this thing - with the same results.I'm doing better with a medium quality dispoable blade, for a lot less money. If you still want one of these - I'll sell you mine . It's sitting in a drawer now...."
5,One of the best childrens books available.,One of the best books available to show children you are never too old for kisses.
2,Good..,It is a good read only after the two escape from the German Prison. So the second half is a much better read than the first ( very boring ) half- all about that tunnel and yellow sand and that damn vaulting horse..
2,"Written as ""faction"" rather then non-fiction","The story is true and very interesting, but Eric Williams made a couple of horrible mistakes in writing this. One is that he changed the names of all the main characters and wrote it in third person. It comes across as a novel rather then non-fiction and Williams has admitted that some of it was added at the insistence of his publisher to make it more exciting. It simply isn't as good a book as it could have been."
2,What a Shame,What a shame we didn't have the recording technology of today when the tracks of this album were originally layed down. Fats Domino would have been pretty amazing to listen to live but this album whilst giving some insight into his skills loses me purely from the lack of quality in the recordings.
3,Mercyful Fate - '9' (Metal Blade),"Follow-up to their 'Dead Again' CD (see my review). Also looks to be the Dutch metal band's most recent release. Possibly their Sawn Song? Wonder if they're still together. Like 'Dead Again', this 1999 effort continues the tradition of serving up a decent helping of black metal, as so few bands can to this day. Tracks that I was most impressed with are ""Last Rites"" (one can really hear King Diamond's sinister vocals here), ""House on The Hill"", the total *ss-kicking ""Insane"" (possibly the CD's best tune), the frantic ""Buried Alive"" and the title cut ""9"". Turn this one up to ten."
4,an awesome return to form,"A fan of old Mercyful Fate like ""Melissa"", on hearing Dead Again for the first time, I liked the riffs, but thought the vocals didn't fit, and I sold that cd. I had no idea what to expect on 9. I'm glad I bought this album. This album is nowhere near as loose as that one, this album is tight, filled with classic Mercyful Fate riffs with even some neo-metal influence. The vocals are very melodic and fit beautifully, and the guitar solos are just awesome. But all in all, this is MF at their most evil--again."
4,"Not Fate's best, but still better than most!","This CD represents a very solid effort on the part of Mercyful Fate. Without a doubt this is the most straight-forward, hard-driving album the band has ever done. Unfortunately, that straightforwardness takes some of the luster off when compared to the band's earlier efforts. Still, having said that, Fate gets it right where so many other bands get it wrong! If are looking for an album that rocks (and I mean ROCKS! ), look no further. While I prefer the more complex and intricate songs found on the band's earlier efforts, the musicianship on 9 is still excellent and nobody, and I mean nobody, sings like the King! Long live Mercyful Fate!"
4,They love EVIL,"If you love evil and want to promote it, then get this CD. I have always wondered why people buy this stuff, as it promotes evil thoughts and subsequently, evil actions. If you like hurting people, then buy this album. It gets into your mind/heart/soul. People who haven't thought through the reason for evil will like this ablum. It tells them to be evil, promote evil (ie Satan) but doesn't get to the reason for his existence. It is a childish, though powerful, attempt to describe the reason for evil (Satan)."
5,THIS IS INCREDIBLE,"this man is one the best vocalist ever.two thumbs up.awesome.great songs supreme evil the way mercyful fate is meant to be last rites,house on the hill.to the amazing song 9 .fate fans you have to have this .HAIL TRUE METAL LEGENDS LIKE THIS WILL LIVE ON FOREVER ..CYA I AM OUTTA HERE.! HAILS DIAMOND"
4,The good stuff,"All hail the KING! The music is dark and wicked. In other words, the music of metalheads!"
4,Civil War history,Stratigy and tactics explored in this book. Battles not ordinarily written about prior to surrender. Good book to add to Civil War library
5,Good Stuff,"I picked up a dusty old copy of this book from my local library thinking it would show its age and wouldn't be nearly as well written as a more recent one such as Battle Cry of Freedom. However, Catton's writing is very eloquent and engaging even after almost 50 years. He is poetic at times. Criticism? There's always room for a little bit...this is definitely a Union view of the war. Catton relates the Union generals' strategies, but we never learn of Lee's thoughts and strategies in as great of depth. I think this book is better than Battle Cry of Freedom, but it doesn't go into the Southern perspetive nearly as much as Freedom does."
4,Good book!,"I would recommend anyone just starting out with interest in the civil war to read this. I found it to definitely be a page turner. The authors writing style you can't beat. I know in due time I'll reread it, yes, it's that good. I thought the end,Lee surrendering would have been (You could've heard a pin drop) moment. Not at all, it was more generalized if anything. James McPhersons, Battle Cry of Freedom was better in that moment of the end of the war.That said, buy it, You won't regret!"
1,"One so-so song, so one star..","This record is by far Neil Young and crazy Horses' worst. No need to own this at all, not even for completeists. ""inca Queen"" is the only half-decent song here, and it's overproduced. Avoid this CD!"
3,The least-selling Neil Young album.,"I found this at a record store recently and grabbed it because Neil is my fave artist, yet I had never heard of this album. I also knew it was released just two albums before Freedom which I love, and this was five bucks. The cover photo of Neil rockin' also game me some hope.After many spins I've found it to be pretty good, it only suffers when compared to other Neil albums. This happens to many musicians. They release a good album that gets bumped down to fair because their other albums are great. There are no hits on Life, but it's enjoyable front to back. There is some synth and even horns in some songs, which usually works. Lyrics lean political, but hey, it's Neil.One fact I read was that Life is his least selling album of all time. Understandable as it was lost in his pre-comeback years. I wouldn't call Life essential, but for the real fan it's a good listen."
2,A bad album with Crazy Horse--is it possible?,"Yes it is. Don't believe anyone who tries to tell you this is ""underrated"" or a ""return to form"". This is pretty bad. Its bogged down with typically horrible 80's production values including god-awful sound effects that ruin some tracks. A few of these songs manage to rise above the muck to become somewhat memorable, and could potentially have been quite good if recorded with the right production and feel. However, as it stands there are certainly no Young classics here--Crazy Horse or no Crazy Horse. You really don't need to lose any sleep if this is not part of your collection."
4,life,"I'm new to Niel Young I've basicly only heard Harvest and this title ""Life"" and all i can say is Wow! I've read some of the other reviews of Mr. Young's work and if the reviewers only rate this as so-so I can""t wait to experiance the rest of Mr. Youngs work."
2,Lifeless,"More like lifeless...except for ""When Your Lonely Heart Breaks"" and ""We Never Danced."" The rest really falls flat"
4,life is good.,"most poeople who listen to this record like the ballads, cause they are standard neil in most ways, i, on the other hand love this record for the first three tracks. ambitious and interesting, dated yet good.i recomend this over reactor or landing on water anyday."
4,Underrated,"One of Neils better albums. Nice melodies. No hits, which is sometimes better. Just solid songs without regard to hit song formulas. Neil Young really doesn't need hit songs anymore. And for the most part hit songs are a compromise and giveaway to record labels so they can make more money. I like this album. No BS, just Neil Young doing what he does best. A rock icon who has moved beyond the need or desire to be one."
3,"Why is this available, but not ""Time..."" and ""Stars...""?","Sorry to be a scold, but a few of Neil Young's most interesting disks have been taken off the market. ""Life"" is pretty good. Certainly three songs deserve to be preserved, ""We Never Danced,"" ""Mideast Vacation,"" ""Inca Queen"" and ""When Your Lonely Heart Breaks."" But by comparison, ""American Stars and Bars"" is a classic album, and ""Time Fades Away,"" while messy, has the classic title song and ""Don't Be Denied."" I don't get why this album (and the equally shaky ""Landing on Water"") would survive when there's no room for those two. WB, pay attention!UPDATE: AMERICAN STARS AND BARS HAS SINCE BEEN RE-RELEASED. BUT STILL NO ""TIME FADES AWAY."""
3,Sufficiently Interesting,"This Video has it's high points and it's lows too. Most segments are interesting, but not that wonderful. I'm a big fan of Stacy Sanches and Carrie Wescott, so the scene at the pool has to be my personal favorite, but many of the rest are decent too. I'd say that I'd recommend you buy the second video in the series if you want a great video. This one is okay."
1,The not-so-shocking Mrs. Maas,"If awards were given to writers for packing the most cliches into one book--or even into one sentence--this gal would be in the running. Here's one of my favorites: ""I was fit to be tied, ready to throw in the sponge and tell them where they could take their cotton-pickin' job."" If this is your idea of sparkling prose, welcome to it. I find it no wonder that she and her husband didn't get too far as screenwriters. Of course, the fact that their greatest success was a now-forgotten Betty Grable musical should tell you something. As for the ""shocking"" facts about early Hollywood, the trade reviews (see above) quote every one of the most interesting, gossipy and shocking passages in the book. So save your money: you've just read it."
5,Hollywood at its best...and worst from one of its first,"Extraordinary story from many angles: that of a bright, young female writer in the Twenties who could have risen to the top of her profession and should have, were it not for the jealous men who got in her way. That of a woman who was there when Hollywood was still a dirt road and saw it all. That of an emancipated woman who celebrates her independence in every sense of the word. That of a brilliant screenwriting couple permanently scarred by the McCarthy Witchhunts. I would have wished for more on her (and Ernest's) life after Hollywood. Did they stay in touch with Hollywood friends? How did their lives change? Reminds me a bit of today's crop of downsized millions forced to rechart their lives and who face the formidable barrier of age discrimination. Wonderful book! And by a near-centenarian, yet! What a salute to life after 50!!"
3,Well written but...,"Mrs. Maas obviously has a talent for writing and unfortunately doesn't let us forget it for one minute. She talks about socialism with a fervency, slamming the studio bosses at every opportunity (they are the ones with the money after all) but has no objection to riding her ego through Hollywood while being well-paid for her work. She flays many well-known celebrities to the bone. Even the individuals she likes, she finds fault.Some utopia she leaves in her wake. If you can put up with these shenanigans, it's an interesting book about the Silents and offers background other books neglected.P.S. Did you know she was more photogenic than Greta Garbo?"
5,Good Quality,"I only got this book for a college class. It does what it needs to for the class, but I wouldn't read it if I didn't have to."
1,Doesn't fit properly,"Cover doesn't fit. Recessed area where differential gear is supposed to lie in was making contact with gear. Installed it and everything seemed to be fine,no leaks or anything. After driving it and inspecting it the next day noticed it was leaking a lot, didn't have time to mess with it so I let it sit until the weekend, (all the fluid leaked out). Upon removing and inspecting it the gear was eating into the metal of the cover, I had metal flakes all in the differential that needed to be flushed out. Re-installed the original and had no problems."
5,Coffee Fan,My husband loves to make coffee with the Chemex coffee maker. They are good coffee filters. Hard to make coffee without filters :)
4,Save yourself some money and make your own filters,"Save yourself some money and make your own filters. Buy a box of 1000 round filters at a warehouse club for about 7 dollars. Take one of the filters and fold it in half. Take the folded half filter and fold it in half again to end up with a quarter of a circle. Put it into the neck of the Chemex and open one of the folds to fit it into the neck. Fill it with coffee and pour hot water through it to make your coffee. If you use two filters one on top of another instead of one filter, you will get real clear oil free coffee that tastes wonderful. This is a good trick and it saves you a lot of money too.Enjoy, Pag"
1,Gives coffee a paper taste,The coffee brewed with these filters has a paper taste. These filters are not recommended.
2,Pre-folded??,"Not crazy about this product. The filters are not really pre folded. One side must be pulled open, which makes for an unbalanced and thicker filter on the other side. A true cone-shaped filter with equal thickness would be preferred."
5,"Effective, no hassle, easy to use filters","These work very well. Fold the point of the cone in the opposite direction to help it maintain a cone shape before pouring grounds in. Most recommend pre wetting the filter before putting grounds in, I haven't been able to taste a difference personally.Slightly expensive for what they are, but there's little hassle and they work very well so they're worth it. I like the circular shaped better than the square shaped filters simply because there's less paper sticking above the edges of the Chemex. That's just me."
5,Rise,"This is my favorite album from Kim Richey. It's a far cry from the material she did on past albums (which is excellent too). RISE is a more edgy, and experimental album, than any of her prior ones. On this disc, Kim Richey worked with producer Bill Botrell, who previously worked on Sheryl Crow's breakthrough debut album TUESDAY NIGHT MUSIC CLUB, and Shelby Lynne's I AM SHELBY LYNNE disc. The two are a good match, and I can only hope that they will work together again. The lyrics still have the introspection that we've come to love and expect from her. ""This Love"" is one of my favorites, a fun uptempo song. ""Fading"" is so sad, she sings so softly and so sadly on this one. ""Girl In A Car"" is very introspective and revealing, as is ""A Place Called Home"" which she recorded in one take, and she was choked up while singing this song about searching for a place of her own. ""The Circus Song (Can't Let Go)"" is very cool. Another highlight is the haunting ""Electric Green"". Overall a great album!"
3,"I'm a HUGE fan, but . . .","I absolutely ADORE Kim Richey and her past albums. Saddly, this one doesn't reach her past performances. A Place Called Home is an incredible song! But, that was the only one I really enjoyed. I was disappointed when I listened to the entire CD. I gave it several chances, still, I found it a bit ""out there"". It was too slow, too jazzy, and just not what she's capable of. I hope her next one is better!"
2,Those Other Reviews Need Some Balance,"I am also a long-time Kim Richey fan and no, I have no problem with artists making musical departures and reinventing themselves. That doesn't mean different is better. This album is so low-key, unmelodic and spare that it sounds like a demo from a poetic high schooler with a guitar. Listen to some of the sample tracks before you purchase. What you'll hear is pretty much all you get. It's been a long time between ""Rise"" and her previous album - is this all we get?"
2,"Lame, What happened!","I have Kim's self titled CD in high rotation in my CD player and I was looking forward to this CD. I had high hopes that it would be better than the last album, which seemed rushed and not nearly as refined as her previous efforts. I was sorely disappointed. I'm all for trying new things, but when they don't work, they don't work. I can only guess that she was trying to go for a more pop sound.The annoying synthesizer on ""The Circus Song"" makes me reach for the by pass button on the CD player.There were some highlights and I believe that the songwriting is still probably very good, but I can't get past the production. I can't help feeling that someone at the record company said ""this is what you should sound like."" Which is very disappointing since Kim had such a distinctive sound."
1,Very Disappointed,"After having been blown away by Kim's first release, I bought this CD and was thoroughly disappointed. I'm not sure what direction she is heading musically (maybe to imitate Jewel in some way), but the crisp, distinctive, and melodic sound of her first CD is virtually lost on this one. In essence...the amazing ""groove"" is missing. Other than ""Place Called Home"", which is good, this release feels like she is trying to be someone she is not. I hope she finds the magic again in future releases."
1,big step backwards,"These songs arent up to Kims very high standards.Kim can ROCK and this cd doesnt,extremely dreary.I dont think much of the production,but Im not immpressed at all by Sheryl Crow.Bill Bottrell ruined Fading, a gem.The songs they wrote together are like B sides compared to the first three cds.Bill Bottrell a genius?This makes Glimmer look like Sgt Pepper."
5,great store. great experience.,"might have already said this, but this store is great. wonderful quality and, most importantly in this impersonal age of online retail, amazing customer service!!!! just like working with a family owned business, which it may be. i highly recommend shopping with them. and call them if you've got special requests or questions or changes to your order."
5,Max and Ruby's Midas: Another Greek Myth,"Another wonderful Max and Ruby story! Once again, Maxoutsmarts his long-suffering sister Ruby. My kids (2 and 4)love this book. The story is funny and the pictures are clever. Its also fun for grown-ups to read. I can't recommend Max and Ruby enough."
4,Good but Not the Best Furtwangler You Can Get,"Both 5th and 7th are pretty good, Furtwangler usually has a more expansive view of Beethoven's symphonies; however these two seem to me dragging a little. My recommendation is get Furtwangler's 5th with BPO 1943 live and Beecham's 7th with RPO 1959. Furtwangler's war time recording of 5th is perhaps most glorious 5th anyone can expect. Beecham's 7th provides us the most lively 7th symphony available."
2,very unsecure,I was very disappointed with this. Anyone with a week of lock picking practice could bypass this in under a minute. First time I opened the box I had it picked about 20sec and I am a definate amateur.
2,Item Pic 50/50,"This item shows two pics, one is a different model. I received the second of the two pics. Disappointing to say the least. The item in the first pic is a great box and features a double sealing rim which seals really well. The item I got only has a single rim, which means it does not seal well at all. The latches also do not lock down as well. Basically, don't order this item unless you want to 50/50 on what item you actually get. Could be the good one, could be the not so good one. I would return it but time is tight."
5,Still a Benchmark Performance,"I have just downloaded one of EMI records' greatest Christmas recordings, Vaughan Williams's Hodie. I had lost the LP of this wonderful work and I was most happy to see that recording available as a CD and download. The music is as stupendous as ever, thanks to Willcocks and Rose. The recording is wonderfully vivid; it is as if one is in the actual recording location. It remains a valuable recording of a beloved Vaughan Willliams work that is a ' must have', not only as a 'Christmas' album but one for the archives.Hodie / Fantasia on Christmas Carols"
4,Simple Division,"This is a brightly colored level 1 easy-to-read book that encourages children to think about division and how to divide items evenly. The rabbit and the hare try to divide a mushroom into equal parts without success. The raccoon intervenes and eats the mushroom. They try again with an apple, but it is not divided in equal parts either. The raccoon offers to help again but rabbit and hare are wiser and decline his help. Rabbit and hare devise a plan to cut the larger and smaller pieces of the apple into equal parts. I would recommend this book to help children start to understand division and apply it to real life situations."
5,A tour de force of country rock,This underapreciatted album will always find a spot in my collection. His duets are refreshing to hear even after all these years. The tour that followed it's release was one of his best tours ever.
5,WAY better than I remember,"I remember being vaguely disappointed with this one when it came out. But I'm durned if I can remember why. Hearing it on CD, I like it as well as I liked _Comes a Time_.It's mostly traditional, straight-up country music, with the usual Neil twists (this time it's astronauts sitting around watching reruns of Muhammed Ali). The opening track -- a beautiful take on ""The Wayward Wind"" -- is the only track that Neil didn't write, and it's as lovely as ""Four Strong Winds"" on _Comes a Time_. The guest appearances by Waylon & Willie are suitably understated. The songs are strong.I honestly do not remember why I wasn't thrilled with this when it was first released. But whatever the reason, I was wrong, wrong, wrong.I seem to recall that around the time this album was released, David Geffen sued Neil for putting out uncharacteristic and uncommercial music. Well, here's hoping Neil keeps that up forever.Neil, I apologize for doubting you. I haven't got a _clue_ what I was thinking."
4,Country Roads,"Neil Young is probably the most eclectic performer in rock. The trio of albums he released between 1982-1985 are the best example of his wandering muse. Trans is a futuristic, electronic album, Everybody's Rocking is an homage to 50's rock sounds and this album, Old Ways is a countrified album in the tradition of Harvest. The album contains some great tracks awash in the steel guitar sounds that mesh so well with Mr. Young's voice. Old Ways has some great stuff including ""Are There Any More Cowboys?"", ""Misfits"", ""California Sunset"" and the superb ""Bound For Glory"". Old Ways is like an old pair of jeans, comfortable."
2,Not good,"Neil's career spans the spectrum from country (this album) to punk, but never does he seem more out of his element. This, to my ears, fails to be either good Neil Young or good country. No reason to listen, except for the most enthusiastic collectors of Young.'Harvest' is a much better effort at Young country (if you'll pardon the expression)."
2,This is album is terrible.,"Even though I love Neil Young's country-rock stuff, I found this album completely uncohesive. Kinda tough to listen to. I was warned about this album from other Neil-o-philes but I didn't listen. Not recommended."
1,Turd Coupe,This album is absolutely terrible. It sounds like the band America trying to cover a Neil Young album. Avoid.
4,A solid addition to a great body of work.,"This recording is part of the ongoing development of one of the world's most talented and under-appreciated artists. Trends come and go, but Mr. Young continues to explore basically what he wants to - what interests him. This may not be one of his most crucial works, but it's far from trivial and never hard to take: there are several tunes here that are among his best."
3,Get back to the country,"I don't know that I love this whole album, but the song ""Get Back to the Country"" is perhaps the greatest hoe-down jam Neil did since Hawks and Doves. If you don't buy the album, do buy this song."
3,Neil really does get back to the country,"This is for Neil Young fans and country music (not the lousy modern country-rock) fans who may like Neil Young. He collaborates with Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings on a few songs, so that should tell you something about the recording. This is pretty good light country music to listen to. It's not spectacular, in my opinion, but good stuff. I recommend purchasing only to fans with a real interest in this type of music."
5,A real delight!!!,"I dont' know if I can begin to match the awe- inspiring eloquence of the previous reviewer, but I'll try. By the way, if all ""snake movies"" seem the same to you, why bother to watch any more, let alone comment on them?Anyway, having been born in Africa, and being familiar to some degree with snakes, Steve Irwin takes my breath away. He is courageous, knowledgeable, funny and definitely passionate about what he does. I could watch him for hours. Apart from being incredibly entertaining, the man is wise, and he loves and respects all living things.In his hands, literally speaking, any species of snake, whether one likes them or not, become fascinating. The risks he takes in handling dangerous serpents leave me awestruck. I love what this man does. Long may he entertain and educate us. I, for one, take great delight in watching everything he does. He is NEVER boring!!!Watch him and see..."
3,"Best for lighter women's shoes, not larger/heavier men's","Unless you only put narrow shoes in this rack, there's no way it'll hold 36 shoes. The spacing of the supports is just too narrow. I've managed to put about 2 pair of men's shoes on each row, and squeezed in maybe a pair of sandals along with them on the same row.Also there's no way this thing will fit chunky hiking boots in case you were wondering (but I wouldn't ding it for that!).It bends a bit once it's full, and with big shoes the bottom of the rack does not manage to touch the door (the shoes push it away from the door). Also with heavier shoes the rows tend to flip and come loose from the rails; to fix that I put a zip tie around the end of each row to keep it in place.Despite all of that, I think it'll probably stay in one piece for a while. We'll see!"
3,Use a wide (enough) door!,"If you don't want to screw this product into your door, make sure your door is wide enough for the shifting that takes place with use. My experience has been that the side bar is constantly falling between the frame and door when the door is ajar. My door is 24 inches. The rack itself measures 22 1/4 inches. I'll probably be putting in a few screws now..."
2,Not recommended,"It is what is says, but is flimsy and comes apart easily. It was a waste of money. Do not purchase."
2,Shoe Rack is not too good,This product is possibly the cheapest thing I have ever owned. It's very cheaply made and is made out of the thinnest metal possible. I almost broke it just trying to hang it. The fact that it says it will hold 18 shoes is BS. If you are using it for childrens shoes it might be possible. Normal sized shoes cant fit on the sides because there is not enough room. I do not recommend this item at all. I wish i had not bought it.
1,bad product all around,first the hooks were too narrow for my door. also the shoe holders are so close together that you can't fit 3 pairs across unless you have womens shoes. also the construction is just bad. do not waste your money like i did
2,"Hard to Assemble, Seems Flimsy","Bought it to hang my collection of scarves. The screws are near impossible to get in. Out of four screws I only successfully screwed in one; the other three are only partially screwed (hoping it will hold). Not sure if it would support the weight of the shoes, but for the scarves it seems ok so far (couple hours). I will probably reinforce the places its screwed with tape. It also snags my scarves as it has rough edges where the metal has been attached. This will probably not be a problem for shoes though. Overall, I would not say its a good purchase but not bad enough to deal with the hassle of returning. If you're comfortable with the quality of product you're getting and you're not trying to hang something super heavy, it should be fine."
1,"Poor quality, sent it back","This shoe rack is shoddy quality. The screws used to ""secure"" it together do not ever fully tighten. The rack feels wobbly and like it will fall apart if you were to fully load it with the number of shoes it claims to be able to hold. I returned it immediately--didn't trust it to hold shoes overnight."
3,Not what it promises,"This shoe rack is just alright. It's pretty easy to assemble and hangs nicely from the door. However, it does not fit 18 shoes! The spacing for the shoes is too tight, and I was only able to fit 15 pairs of shoes on it, mostly sandals. But, since the spacing is very tight, taking a pair of shoes off this rack and putting them back on can be a pain in the butt. If you want to use this rack for sports shoes, forget it. You will only be able to put 12 pairs of them on this rack. However, it might be perfect for childrens shoes!"
4,Gets the job done for narrow shoes,"Very efficient shoe storage, but really for narrower women's shoes. Men's shoes don't fit on it very well (the rings for hanging the shoes are too close together, and men's shoes - especially sneakers - are too wide)."
4,Great for kids' shoes!,Totally what I wanted in a shoe rack. I have 3 kids and lots of shoes to deal with... Perfect for my kids! Easy on/easy off. Hangs from door nicely -- door even shuts! Bought another one for all the summer shoes...
4,perfect shoe place,"A perfect place for shoes, gets them off the floor, out of the way, and convenient. Only problem is that sometimes the top pulls out, and you have some easy fixing to do. In spite of that, I wouldn't have anything else....they're great !!!!!!"
2,aluminum disaster,"the racks will not stay in the holes they were designed for therefore the shoes stay on the floor anyway, even moved it to the back door of my scrapbook room but even that did not help it from falling apart constantly"
3,decent,"this is a decent product. it doesn't hold as many shoes as advertised if you wear man size shoes. it has optional (screws not included) screw holes that you pretty much have to use or it adjusts off the door every two days. so yeah you probably should know that you have to put holes in your door. other than that it is pretty good. it does hold shoes on the door as advertised, and it is simple to put together without the need for tools."
2,It's not as good as I had hoped...,"I was looking for some good background music for Christmas, but this cd is very cheesy. I was hoping for more."
5,Great Christmas Surprise,"I was so, so pleased with the overall feel of this album. It has a strong Christmas charm with a jazz club feel. The mere fact that this group could cover ""Cool Yule"" in a fun and respectable fashion says a lot about the quality and the well done arrangements. More fun than a lot of Christmas albums from better known bands and singers."
2,Sorry to be a Scrooge...,"...but it has to be said: While 'Martinis and Misteloe' is a swinging concept, it doesn't translate to a quality Christmas party-spirited cd -- in this case. From the first notes, and then the vocals, sadly it just never improves. However, negative reviews really should be accompanied by an alternative suggestion; here's mine: 'Ultra-Lounge: Christmas Cocktails, Part One'."
2,There's a Reason it's So Cheap,"The instrumental portion of the CD is very good. Just what you would expect from a ""Lounge Music"" genre. But where did they find those female singers? Yikes, makes the hair on the back of my head stand on end. Would be a great CD without the vocals."
4,Great Album,"This is one of the first albums to show how diverse KMFDM can get with their music styles and vocal choices. I love the contribution of Morgan Adjei! As I buy each album, whether old or recent, I am pleased with contributors like Tim Skold, Raymond Watts, Lucia Cifarelli, En Esch, and various others. The current contribution of William Wilson (on the WTF?! album) is awesome and new fans should check him out! UAIOE is still cool!"
3,The Final Solution!,"Even as a big fan of KMFDM, even I'll accept that they can be hit or miss. UAIOE is certainly what could be called an awkward transition album, but that gives it a special charm."
5,Great for aches and soreness,"This oil is great for aches and muscle soreness. I don't understand the other negative reviews. I have been using Mahanarayan oil for years, and Banyan Botanicals is making some of the best Ayurvedic oils available."
2,Christie leftovers,"Agatha Christie wrote some astonishing and superb mystery books -- this is not one of them.Here we have a compendium of ""Christie Crumbs,"" short pieces which never blossomed into larger mystery stories. Herein, you'll find elements of and thoughts from Christie's larger works but none of them seem to manifest into anything significant. A number of the endings just sort of hang you out, reminiscent of some of the stories that you might encounter in ""Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine,"" only not so entertaining as those great little, well-edited tales.This book would be okay to take along for the morning bus ride or to the doctor's office. But unless you are a totally devoted Christie fan and must read everything that she wrote, I'd take a pass on this one and go with one of her more renowned works."
2,A disappointed Christie fan,"I thought I would love this, but like an earlier reviewer said, the supernatural mysteries were a bit disappointing. When I read a Christie mystery, I want to find out who did it in the end. When she writes the supernatural ones, the ending is left a bit unexplained, which I found aggravating. Also, some stories have a sad ending, which seems unusual compared with her other works."
2,"Dated, silly","These stories hit the same basic theme over and over: good honest people down on their luck are miraculously rescued by a chance encounter with a wealthy benefactor. The phrase ""there was nothing of the Socialist in him/her,"" a Christie favorite, recurs. The writing style may have passed for suave and worldly at one time, but now just seems silly. It reminds me of low-rent porn fiction. Not good at all."
5,"More than you know, Abstract Tribe Unique is pure genius.","It has been said often that the hip hop underground yields some of the culture's greatest potential, but indeed turn out to be unworthy of commercial noteriety. Mood Pieces is a remarkable example of hip hop ingenuity and creativity, painting pictures with Rude's lyrical onslaught. Definitely this is a must have, not because it is a rarity, but because it is simply a great example of content and skill, which these days are hard to come by, unless delving into the underground catacombs. Abstract Rude has the talent of creating a mood that directly coincides with the subject of his song, any of which would be a good example. I am thoroughly impressed to say the least. Such intellect is appreciated and long awaited. Furthermore, I must point out that he is from the west coast, a place where hip hop was thought to be dead to the world...but I think we were the ones sleeping."
5,LOVE!!!,I absolutely love these slippers. I can wear them to work or just around the house. A great addition!!!! Also a great gift.
3,returning,"I bought these for my husband. He thought they looked ""cheap"" and they did not fit him. He wears a size 13 W, I was hoping these would fit but they did not. Easy return, so I can't complain"
4,"Comfortable, but hot!","These slippers are great in many ways. Very comfortable. Perfect for around the house, but also great for walking around the yard (rubber soles!). This particular model is nice enough to wear in front of guests (or even on a quick errand), but casual enough to work well with a bathrobe and undershirt (a la Tony Soprano).Unfortunately, these slippers do get hot. If your feet warm up quickly or easily it may be worth trying another model. I am only able to wear my pair for short periods, otherwise I get too hot.Don't say I didn't warn you."
5,Simply the BEST,"I have told my wife is want to wear these as my daily shoes. If I could make my gym shoes feel this good, I would be one happy dude. If you find they fit snuggly at first, wear them with socks and the software furry padding inside will tamp down for you a bit. These slippers are perfect in every way, period!"
2,These run very small!,"I bought these for my husband and although they looked nice and cozy they run very very small. I ordered him an 11, which he usually wears in a slipper, to allow room for heavy socks for winter, and they were so tight across the instep that he couldn't stand to have them on. I sent them back. These are too expensive to not fit right."
2,Pay attention,"When you hover over the picture of the black slippers, it appears that they are suede. When you receive them, they are patent leather. Thankfully Amazon gave me a full refund when I sent them back."
3,tom brady ugg ascot slippers,"I bought these slippers for my college aged son who goes to school in New England and loves sheepskin slippers--so much so that he wore out last years pair that I purchased at Costco (not Ugg).I thought these Uggs--worn supposedly by Tom Brady as per the ads in every magazine--would be great replacements. Although the slippers are attractive, sturdy and cuddly, they are tight and cut very narrow. My son normally wears a size 11.5 shoe so I thought 12 would be perfect. They were so tight that they are unwearable. Last year's Costco knockoffs were also a 12 medium but were roomy--unfortunately, I could not get that pair this year in Costco which Is why I turned to the Uggs. Do you think Tom Brady has a narrow foot?! I have to return these slippers, as nice looking as they are."
3,Long lasting but unable to replace via Amazon,"I purchased this slipper quite a while ago, and it has worn well. I am rough on slippers so wanted to buy another pair but couldn't find them on Amazon listing. Shame, they are a fantastic slipper!"
3,"Shoes good, service not so much.","My husband loves the slippers. But they first took forever to get in the mail and then they shipped two right feet. Customer service was really pleasant to deal with, but it was the longest transaction in history. I probably won't buy from again."
2,Length of wear,Inside edge broke down way too soon. I'm now walking on the side leather instead of the rubber pad on the bottom. I was hoping to get alot more wear out of them.
3,confusing description of product,"Ugg Ascot men's slippers come in suede or leather. I ordered leather, and although the site seemed to offer both, the picture and description were deceiving and I received the wrong slippers. However, I will say the company was very good about refunding my money immediately upon receipt of the returned slippers. Still, the confusion could easily have been avoided. Be clearer about which styles/materials you have for sale."
4,Too good not to wear,"Im on my 2nd pair. Love the comfort. Buy extra UGG replacement insoles.Cost $15, worth having since they wear out in 6 months or less."
4,"Too small, but returned for larger size!","I ordered a size 11 for my boyfriend and I checked all his other shoes to make sure this was the correct size, they turned out being too small. But you have to wear uggs for awhile to get the fur to go down. When you first buy uggs they are tight because the fur is thick, after a few wears the fur will relax and the shoe will be less tight!"
5,Comfortable,"We love our uggs. These are the most comfortable slippers that either of us have ever had. I have the female version, and we both are very happy with our uggs."
5,Great quality at a reasonable price,"I have had some Shearling slippers that where great in the past, but recently have had a pretty tough time finding anything I really liked.The minute I put these slippers on they fit like a glove. They are warm and have a great sole. The sole of too many of the slippers I've owned in the past have been lacking, but these feel like they are supporting my feet well, and the tread looks like they would do well in the winter when I have to run out to get the mail. In fact I would feel comfortable wearing these out. They look great and not at all like your generic house slippers.I would recommend these to anyone, and will probably buy another pair when these wear out."
1,UGG Australia = made in China. Not Worth The Money,"If you enjoyed the UGGs of old, get ready to be disappointed. These slippers have ""UGG Australia"" written everywhere on the box, on the sole, on every available hang tag, sticker, etc. The only place it matters is inside the shoe, and sure enough, ""Made in China"".I can get Chinese-made fleecy slippers anywhere for cheap, hence the desire to find a better pair. Sometimes, you can get what you pay for. Or, as with these UGGs, you just get ripped off. The fleece is junk, the heel is low, the seams... suffice to say, they suck.Keep looking, and shame on UGGs for the bait 'n switch. Too bad, used to be nice stuff.If you go ahead and ignore the lousy review ( like I did ) and order these, they run way small and you will have nasty little clumps of Chinese chem-fur stuck to your feet.Enjoy!!!"
5,Best slippers I've ever owned,"I bought a pair of these in Tea a few years and as long as they keep making them with the same quality and materials I'll be buying them in the future. In fact just bought another pair and am waiting for them to arrive, but just to let you know if I hadn't beat them to shreds wearing them indoors and outdoors , even going out in my 4X4 and walking on day trails with them, as well as wearing them in the rain and snow. Honestly they would have lasted a few years longer if I hadn't abused them but... In my opinion three years of abuse of that kind pays for itself with any shoe, but the comfort is unbeatable on top of it, so these are a great buy for my money.I have other slippers I bought in the same price range bought at about the same time as I purchased these (trying to find something that was as practical for comfort casual everyday wear) and the others have either become a fixture in the closet or have been discarded.Easily the best slippers I've ever owned."
5,Quick and easy,"I ordered these slippers as a gift , but the wrong size, I got my refund and the new size went out so quickly. It was a pleasure"
4,"good quality, fit is a little narrow","Great slipper, good quality. Purchased as a gift. Purchased a size up (no half sizes) to a 12, but fit was a little narrow across the toe. They do stretch some with wear."
5,satisfied!,"This is present for my husband,He is very very satisfied!I love it, too~& warmest shoes ever seen"
5,Run small,"These are very comfortable, however, they do run small. My husband wears an 11 and had to order a 13 to fit"
4,Great slipper but...,"I was drawn to the quality and look of this slipper. I was not disappointed. They are the most comfortable and warmest slipper I have ever worn. Very well made, exactly what you would expect from a company like Ugg's. The only complaint is Ugg's says you can wear them outside. Wrong! I walked my dog to the corner and back and the front of the slippers got scuffed. The rubber on the bottom does not cover enough of the front of the slippers to prevent them from scraping the ground. So I will enjoy them - inside the house only! (Written by my husband. It was his Christmas gift)"
4,Ran small.,"My husband wears a 13W or 14, really hard to find sizes so I was really excited to be able to get him size 14 slippers. The slippers are gorgeous, however they are too small and we have to return them. :-( We have never had this issue when we find a 14 so it was really disappointing. The slippers were gorgeous, just too small."
5,BMc,"Fantastic slipper, true to sizing can be worn outside for light duty use. Very well made and look great, used to wear acorn slippers these are far better."
4,Great Buy,Nice and warm. They do feel like they run a little small but I'm sure in time they will stretch out..
3,not serious,When you read the title of this book you think of lessons of how to live in the ADK.In reality it is the ramblings and far fetched stories of a man with cabin fever
4,Ladies maid,Well written novel but rather sad. As a reflection of the life styles in the 1800's you are aware of how tough life was then.
4,A Good Read,"I rather enjoyed the first half of this book, where it was focused partly on Elizabeth Barrett as a recluse. The writing style is extremely good. However, I was slightly disappointed with the main character and her life. If you're looking for a romance, this is not the book for you. If you're looking for an interesting plot where things don't always turn out ""peachy"" for the characters, this IS the book for you."
2,Painfully SLOW,"I was expecting a very interesting read from this book, but just could not finish it. The characters were dull and the storyline was monotonous and never seemed to go anywhere. Elizabeth Barrett Browning was just plain depressing. I kept hoping something exciting would happen, so I kept on reading, but stopped before I reached the halfway mark. Just too tedious."
2,The Lady's Maid,"This book was our book club pick last month. I would say only half of us read it . It was so slow in starting , I almost did not finish it. However, I loved Elizabeth Barrett and Robt Browning when I was younger . So I gave it another try and finished it. I felt it was too drawn out and very slow to start. This is the reason why I only gave it 2 stars."
5,A balance between the needs of the soul and the business,"Rethinking The Purpose Of Business: Interdisciplinary Essays From The Catholic Social Tradition by Michael J. Naughton (Director of the John A. Ryan Institute for Catholic Social Thought at the Center for Catholic Studies, St. Thomas University, St. Paul, Minnesota) is a selection of impressive and insightful essays by erudite authors concerning business management theories that remain in harmony with social traditions of Catholicism. From keeping an ethical balance while seeking profits, to modern contract theory, to the social ethics of corporate management, Rethinking the Purpose of Business strives to maintain a balance between the needs of the soul and the business necessity of the bottom line. Rethinking The Purpose Of Business is thoughtful and thought-provoking reading which is especially commended to anyone seeking to balance the requirements of faith with the demands of commerce."
5,Excellent teaching for absolute devotion to the Lord,"I am still reading this book, but I've read enough to have it significantly change my outlook on life and afflictions. I have learned in abundance what it means to trust the Lord in troubles and to realize that God will bring me out of them in His time, and it is my duty to praise the Lord and devote my heart to Him. My cup runs over when I read Jeremiah Burroughs."
4,A Puritan Classic,"Most of us think of contentment as a quick check mark on our path toward sanctification. ""Been there. Done that. I'm content.""But Puritan Jeremiah Burroughs applies the scalpel of God's Word to our hearts, peeling back layer after layer of pride and discontentment that most of us didn't even know we had. He is deep and profound, yet surprisingly easy to read.Our family has faced some major trials the past couple years, and my wife found this book very uplifting. We highly recommend it, but be careful what print edition you buy.We bought the 2001 Sovereign Grace edition for someone in our church, but were very disappointed. The font is tiny and almost blurred. Just reading the book is a test in contentment! We are returning that edition and now ordering the 1964 Banner of Truth edition instead."
1,Kindle version incomplete,"I assumed I was buying this entire book, but the Kindle version is only one chapter. I am very disappointed that it was not advertised as such. I have a print copy of this book. It is a Christian classic and it is a book that has had a profound effect on me. I highly recommend the print version, but don't waste your money on the Kindle version."
4,Contended with this Book!,I read this Puritan classic as a devotional in the morning. A needed reminder for me to be content in all things.
2,Kindle Edition terrible,"The content of this book is excellent. However, don't buy the Kindle version. It only has chapter 1 and no TOC. terrible."
1,Only the cover is good,"The book has a nice cover, and that`s about it. Neither the text inside nor the big amount of pictures are intresting or good. A clear waste of money."
4,A wonderful way to remember St. Barths!,"This is a gem pf a book providing superb photos of this stunning island. We bought this book after our trip to St. Barths because we felt it captured the charm and romantic essence of the island in a way that we could not. For those pondering a trip to St. Barths, this book will certainly help persuade you to jump on the next plane."
2,Doesn't do the island justice,"I was hoping for a fabulous book filled with beautiful photographs that capture the essence of the island, it didn't quite measure up. That being said, I have it on the side table of my guest room, and it is fun to browse through."
4,Great cast. Good conducting. Passable sound quality.,"This recording has a magnificent cast under the direction of von Karajan. It's too bad the sound quality isn't better. Nonetheless, for the very reasonable price this is worth the money. It's a very enjoyable performance."
1,RCA Release has pitiful sound,"I don't know about this bootleg, but I bought the recently-released (and expensive) version on RCA and the sound is terrible: there is clipping everywhere and everything is muddled together. Listening to the Flowermaidens was torture. I don't know why this is--other Wiener Staatsoper recordings from this period (e.g. Die Frau ohne Schatten, also with Karajan and Ludwig, on DG) sound much better. Grammophone waxed idyllic about this Parsifal without mentioning the severe sonic shortcomings. It does seem to be a good performance underneath all the distortion. I can't believe the Vienna engineers would have made such a lousy recording--perhaps the tapes were poorly stored or damaged. Maybe this cheaper version is better, if it was taken off a live radio feed."
3,The story has no soul !,"I am frustrated with this book. The characters are there. The plot is there. But the book just fails to deliver. The writer fails to build up on the characters. A pity because the three main characters tangled in a love triangle could have been developed so much better. The writer also places too much emphasis on the killer. The writer is too ambitious as he wishes to convey too much in a 120 pages book. And the result is a somewhat ""flat"" story with much to be desired."
1,"suxs, sent the wrong product and I lost my job because I did not have the tool on time","suxs, sent the wrong product and I lost my job because I did not have the tool on time no buy this"
2,Works but mine broke after a few months of occasional use.,Mostly plastic. Can be very hard to zero. Lettering too small to read unless you lift it up near your face. Mine broke after a few months of occasional use. If you plan to use more than 10-15 times then you should get something better.
5,Works Great!,"This unit works great !I needed a device to rough estimate both floors indoor and distance outside in gravel and grassareas. It is as accurate as a tape line and a heck of a lot a easier to use.(Always make sure you get the one with the ""Big"" wheel unless you will be using it indoors only)The price was right, the shipping time and cost excellent.I am very happy with this purchase."
1,Junk,This wheel didn't even make it 3 weeks and the inner wheel and gear connector broke and now the wheel is useless. I wouldn't purchase another one of these pieces of crap.
1,Do not recommend,This item is not digital and it quit working after three short days of use. I hope their customer service is better than their product.
1,"""cheap product"" not worth it.","made very cheaply,din't like it at all,too fragil the only reason i dint return it,i din't want to loose more time or money on it. even if you were to buy it for a $1.00 it would still be to much."
5,A Must-Have for Verdi Fans,"Here it is, fully remastered, with classic performances by Christoff and Gobbi. Except for Abbado's digital version on DGG, there's no better ""Simon"" on record. Certainly the sound is still dry and the pace of conducting a bit brisk at times, but the entire performance, not the least of which the prelude and first act, are delivered beautifully."
5,The best,I had a new 05 F-150 that had terrible plusing on the OE brake rotor setup. Ford replaced the rotors at 6k miles and less than 1.5k miles they were as bad as ever. Awful! I did the research and decided to try these pads. I did a hard sanding of the rotors on the truck and installed these pads. Awesome!! No more plusing after 25k miles. They don't have the bite of the OE pads when cold so be warned. Do yourself a favor never buy any other brake pad. And no dusting makes them unbeatable.
5,"Excellent, Excellent book on meditation","Walters offers many helpful hints for meditators of all paths, novice or experienced. Even though he is the founder of Ananda (as clearly explained on the back cover), his approach is completely non-sectarian. I would highly recommend this book as an appropriate gift for a friend who meditates, or to give your own practice a boost."
3,"Good, but not entirely dishwasher-safe.","I used these for making star-shaped chocolates, they worked great!However, although they say dishwasher safe, make sure they are on the upper rack. I accidentally washed it on the lower rack, and it was too close to the heating element and melted.There was a Fred brand ice mold next to it which held up fine, since the Fred ones are more heat-resistant - you can put Fred ones in the oven - but not these!I'd rate it higher if it hadn't melted in the dishwasher after the first time I used it."
2,Cute but ice is hard to remove,I got this star tray and the heart tray. I use both but getting the ice out of the star tray takes some wrist work. The heart tray works easily.
2,Cute but difficult,"I bought this one and the Penguin ice cube trays. The stars look awesome but are a real pain the a$$ to get out of the tray, the penguins come out much easier."
1,Too much work,"These things are so hard to remove from the tray, it's not worth the effort. I'd rather just have a warm drink."
2,not that great,too hard to push the ice out! you're better off buying a real ice maker or buy one of those bag of ice at the gas station.
1,waste...,cute yes but I would have to have at least 5 like this in order to produce a significant amount of ice...
5,Pharmaceutical Customer Relationship Management,"This is a wonderful book on pharmaceutical customer relationship management, it is the only book on pharmaceutical selling that I have seen on this subject. The authors bring in so many real world selling skills examples that make it really very educational. I highly recommend this book for anyone in pharmaceutical sales."
2,Disappointing,"I am a huge Christy Canyon fan and was hoping that what I'd find in her book was that she really enjoyed being a sex star. I wanted to hear that she loved the adult world and her fans and was glad to meet them every time she was performing.Instead, her real story is one of abuse that drove her from her home to a life she feels is unsatisfying. She is not a particular fan of the adult industry, even though she became one of it biggest stars, and was anxious to leave it as soon as she could find an alternative.If you want to remain a Canyon fan then don't read this book. If you do, you won't be able to watch her films or see her pictures in the same way again."
3,Interesting but not great,"Christy Canyon's memoir of the porn industry is great. However, her account of her own life is quite boring and egotistical. Unfortunately, her editor decided it would be a good idea to flashback to her childhood, periodically throughout her accounts of the porn industry. Christy's rise in the porn industry is a very interesting and exciting tale to read. To her credit, she writes her experiences in great detail and gives the dirt on many porn stars. I reccomend that the reader should solely focus on her porn career and skip all of the passages on her personal life with her family. Also, Christy thinks quite highly of herself. At one point she proclaims herself to be exceptionally better than a homeless woman because she EARNED her money. Christy also goes on and on about how beautiful she is. Her excessive pride in her looks gets old quick and is most likely a key reason she entered the industry to begin with."
3,Well........,"Funny that Christy Canyon never mentioned in her bio why shenever did any sex scenes with Black Men.Perhaps she'll get aroundto it in the next book.I would also like to add that Ebony Ayes(aka Peggy Robinson) was selling just as many(if not more) videosas Ms Canyon,but was probably receiving half as much money.No supriseshe has distanced herself from the industry."
3,Skirts around the edge,"I did enjoy this book, but it ends half way through the story, enabling a follow up to written. A lot of the chapters begin in this book but are incomplete and reading the follow up will neccesitate to find out the complete story. Christy is where a lot of teenagers are at, entering a maze that can send you down the well or you sink then swim to survive. It would appear on her career choice she was heading towards the well and again when involved in drugs, but she surfaced an astute business person, comfortable with her career paths."
4,Oh Christy!,"Christy Canyon was one of my fave porn stars back in my teen years. Christy Canyon epitomises female sexuality. Her body was the type that literally would stop men in their tracks, gaping open-mouthed in wonder if all ""that"" was real!Glad Christy has met someone who loves her and accepts her for what not only who she is but also who she was.Now if only Jeannie Pepper, one of the all-time hottest black porn actresses, would write her memoirs."
2,decent bio,Interesting what really occurs in the adult video world. The writing is not on par with John Grisham but I didn't expect it to be.
3,Much Ado About Little,"The book ended up being only moderately revealing, if you'll pardon the pun. The jacket suggested that celebrities were mentioned and only one (very minor one) was. I tend to read often, 95% non-fiction, and I suggest you spend the 8-10 hours reading something else. If you're stuck on this subject matter, try something different."
4,Surprising,"Having similar but different events in my life, I am able to feel genuine sympathy for her. I am also looking forward to reading her second autobiography ""Danger, Curves Ahead""."
4,"""Enjoy My Ride!""","That's what Christy wrote on the inside cover of my copy. And you know what? I did enjoy the ride (no pun intended). Although the poor editing of this book is difficult to overlook, I found that the content more than made up for it. There is plenty of gossip and detail in this book, but what sets it apart from the rest is Miss Canyon's sparkling personality. She is beyond witty and just plain laugh-out-loud fun. If you're looking for deep insight and wisdom regarding the porn business, this is not the book for you. If you're looking for an entertaining inside story about the porn business and one of its stars, then you may really enjoy this book."
4,An interesting look inside adult films by a superstar!!!!!!,"Christy Canynon is one of adult films first female superstars and gives a great insight into the making and lifestyle of the adult film industry.Christy relates her encounters with adult films famous and infamous stars including, Ginger Lynn, Ron Jeremy, Peter ""Don't touch my hair"" North and Traci Lords.Christy also gives insights into her childhood and her family life both before and after the adult film career. This book is a worthwhile read for fans of Christy and the adult film genre."
3,Nice rading,"This is a nice written, entertaining book. I would like a bit more on the 80's porn subject and scene and a bit less on her troubled personal life and relationship with his father. But it is a nice purchase, and there aren't that many porn actress bios out there!"
3,Its short and censored.,"I enjoyed this book. However if you're looking for dirty details, you won't find them here. Christy was careful not to burn any bridges (except Jethro maybe) which resulted in a somewhat censored feel to me."
4,Works great,"The watch does everything it advertizes and works great. I coach a swim team of thirty kids and this allows me to keep splits from meets, look at stroke rate, and allows me to store it all. My only complain is that the start button is also the split button, this is different from every other watch I have used. to stop the watch, you hit the button that normally gets splits, you can see how this can cause problems. Oh well, once I get used to it, I'm sure it'll be fine."
1,bad product,in the first week i have a problems with the stopwatch-dont workwork everything less the cronograph
1,Slipped a gear,The corkscrew slipped a gear on the third bottle and it is now in the waste basket. It seized up while opening a bottle and enough pressure was applied to the handle to cause it to slip the gear. This unit operates with a smooth effort. If it seems to require additional force it is probably better to back off on the handle rather than pushing on it.
5,Great Corkscrew!,"I purchased one of these Arcosteel corkscrews several years ago after reading a corkscrew review in Consumers Reports. It was a little difficult to figure out at first, but after opening more bottles it became a breeze. Just clamp it to the bottle top, gently bring the lever over the top and pull it back and, the cork is removed! Remove the unit from the bottle and bring the lever back over the top, clamping it onto the cork, and bring the lever back, and the cork is removed from the corkscrew. What could be easier? And it comes with a foil cutter and extra screw too!"
1,Still Waiting......,"After ordering it months ago, they still haven't shipped my item. They say it's backordered and kepp pushing off the shipping dates. went to Ocean State Job Lots and bought the same one there for $7 and change!!!!"
5,Tokyo Rose are awesome live!,"I've heard them live and they are awesome. After that show I have their cd and I love listening to it all the time now, their songs stick in your head for a while because they are so catchy.The guys are fun to hang out with as well.

4,Great Allegheny Passage Companion,"If you plan to through bike/hike the GAP, this is a helpful planning tool and an entertaining read of the history of this route."
1,RIDICULOUS PRICE ON THIS AMAZON LISTING!!! :-(,Has it occurred to anyone to CORRECT the obviously ridiculous price for this paperback book as shown here on Amazon??!!! It's currently listed as $999.98! :-(
5,Excellent Tool!,"I bought this for a friend who is rebuilding/restoring my truck.The kit has all the bells and whistles needed to do most auto repair; variable speed, forward and reverse, comfortable to hold, runs on standard house current, has great power, securely holds sockets, AND comes with six sockets! I selected the 1/2"" square drive because the majority of sockets on the market are made to for this size drive (without having to spend a great deal more money for the larger size sockets). The cord also will detach for the tool itself for easier storage. Milwaukee tool storage cases are excellent! They are rugged, dependable, and well thought out for the tool placement inside.Milwaukee Heavy Duty is a great line of tools. I love the 5 year warranty on the tool. Worth every penny you spend on this."
1,Ted's explanation of the band.,"The second half of this '2-LPs on one CD' disc is a very listenable collection of English ""folk"" tunes (Greenseleeves, Lincolnshire Poacher, London Bridge, etc). The first half (all 24 cuts of it)is a wonderfully entertaining, crisp and lucid explanation of how the instruments in a modern dance band line up, blend, and generally produce fine music. It includes an explanation of how Glenn Miller first achieved his unique sound. As well as educational, it is highly listenable."
1,Incorrect search results,"I searched for a repair manual for my 1997 pontiac grand am and this item came up. The year, make, and model come up in the search results. However, this manual is for 98+ grand am's."
3,OK for those that know what they are doing,"Mostly has the steps needed for routine maintenance. Helpful, but not that great for major repairs. Best used by someone that has some mechanical knowledge."
2,Worst paint job i have ever seen,OMG is the paint bad on this thing it looks like they painted on the stripes with a paintbrush and a can of spraypainthalf of the stripes just stop so half is striped and half is just white and there are drips and over paint
3,Drifting into madness,"Joseph Blau has an infriroity complex and maintains a rigid regime to keep his world in order. He is convinced his class hate him and want to destroy him and lives in fear believing that every word, every thought has a consequence that is linked to fate.This isn't a comfortable read and you find it hard to sympathise with Blau at times, but Ungar gets into the mind of a madman and the whole story is seen from that viewpoint.'The Class' is very much of its age;ie between the wars bohemia in thinking style and philosophy. To me this is what makes it a curio of interest. The first World War effectively ended Regal rule-it was part of the class war that had raged in Europe since the French Revolution,and between it and WW2 (the next great realignment of power war) a lot of avante garde work was produced of which this is one. Blau is haunted by his own station in life and that of his superiors."
5,Love these bows,"Really cute bows. I have a 15 month old daughter and these stay put in her hair. Also, the are easy to put on even when she is moving her head all around."
2,It's ok?,"Eh, this wasn't what I thought would be.After seeing Blade I thought getting the actual album would have it just as good & even more.I was mistaken.It's good for starters who need a good baseline for mixing in the dancehalls & who are creating their own spins or elaborations. Apart from that, I wouldn't get this product."
2,Disappointment,"The product itself was as the seller promised so this is not a mark against the seller. The collection, however, turned out not to have the song I thought was on it and the rest was throw away."
4,Snippets from some of the greatest martial arts films,"A collection of film clips from some of the best. Great fast paced action excerpts from movies of Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, Samo Hung & other greats. Fun to watch! Dont expect a story. This is good for reference & previews of movies of this genre to add to your collection."
5,FOR THE TRUE MARTIAL ARTS FAN,"This is a very fast paced film. It is a documentary like you've never seen. Ninety minutes of almost nothing but fighting. It shows you how to use many types of martial arts weapons, it show you the intense training that these great martial artist went through, and it shows how to use the altamate weapon...the fist.Scene after scene of your favorite stars in their most action packed films, John Saxon narratorates this classic in the martial arts films."
3,OK for some,This movie narrated by John Saxon tells the story of the development of Chinese and Japanese action movies. It tells about the characters who pioneered the development from the earliest days. It gives a preview of many action movies which we have never heard of - spoken in the native language with English subtitles. There is no plot to this movie. It is more of a documentary.
3,"Response to ""A Music Fan""","In response to ""A Music Fan"" from Idaho, I located the song you were looking for. Mary Griffin is a singer from N.O, and her song ""Anytime"" can be found on her ""Purified"" album.."
1,Deceived and cheated,I ordered this camera case based on the description and the photos thinking that it was the same as the well worn case I currently owned. Something is terribly wrong with the photos and the description. This item number 803BK is for a SMALL camera bag that is very different than the pictures on the web site. I feel very cheated.
2,Bad sound! Great performance!,"As said before by another reviwer, the microphoning of the singers is completely wrong, what spoils this recording! The opera itself is interesting enough to deserve other (better) recordings. This performance seems to have been great (specially for Gencer and Grilli) unfortunately it is not very pleasant to listen to this cd."
2,Great performance of a mediocre work,"Gencer was a great soprano all right, but NOT of the 1930s and '40s as the previous reviewer stated...she made her debut in the early 1950s and sang until the early 1980s. Therefore the poor sound here is just the result of EXTREMELY bad miking!"
1,it's going to make you cringe,"I own this c.d. because I own all of Neil's albums (and obviously enjoy most of them). I will probably continue to buy all of Neil's releases, but, trust me: this one is an unqualified disaster. It's as if he'd just heard Kraftwerk's Trans Europe Express and a Devo album and then wrote and released this an hour later in a lame attempt to be techno/modern. Try as I might, I just can't even give it 2 stars. I think the reviewer is probably correct who states that it's so bad that you kind of admire the guts it took to put it out. Of course, this album was one of a few that was rumoured to be deliberately bad to get back at Geffen Records during a notorious contract battle. (Lou Reed famously put out Metal Machine Music in the mid-70's for similar reasons while contracted to RCA; it remains the most unlistenable joke ever released!)"
1,Skip It - one of Neil's worst albums,"Of all the stylistic detours Neil Young took during the 1980s, new wave synthesizer guru was probably the least likely to work. It might have helped, however, if he had brought some better songs to the occasion. Simply put, there is not a memorable tune on the whole album. The synthesizers in the background become particularly grating after a while. Give Young credit for never rejecting a musical idea. But skip this ill-fated project."
1,"VERY,VERY,VERY awful!","This can't be Neil Young! This sounds too new wave to be him. I can't even believe he did this album, this is practically a disgrace to his rock career, but to take him back he still is one of the best artists of all time and this is the only album that sucks. So I forgive him. But people don't listen to this album, your wasting your time if you want to listen to this Neil Young album."
2,A contract record,"The main problem with this record was that that it was only a contract record. Neil was under contract to make one more record for Geffen. He gave them the garbage he had been playing with at the time. The only value this record has is for the collector of the whole collection. It is just a sad consequence of the music business that we have to see stuff like this still. Geffen is still trying to get money out of Neil by rehashing old stuff. Lucky Thirteen is a prime example. 2 stars, because it is still Neil."
2,Help I've Created A Monster!,"Not a successful genre experiment by Mr Young. It is quite puzzling why this is still available while ""On The Beach"", ""Time Fades Away"", and ""Re-Ac-Tor"" are not available on CD. Neil would have more success with later projects."
3,Lack of balance,"With this kind of rhythm heavy techno sound, you need to balance it with a huge soulful voice or with monster guitar riffs and soloing. Neil has a good (not great) voice, and Young's guitar is unleashed on only about half of these tunes. But both are buried too deep in the mix. A different producer with a better understanding of this kind of techology, like maybe Eno or Lanois, and Landing or even Trans could have been as career-defining as Rust and Harvest.For those who love hard & heavy guitar, you'll probably enjoy tracks like ""Hippie Dream"", ""Touch the Night"", ""I Got a Problem"", and ""Drifter""."
1,"An ""out of his domain"" type album.","This album is not one you'd think of if you thought about Neil Young. Being the hard-core fan I am, though, I also realize that Neil doesn't really like to identify himself with one type of music. But this was a failing attempt at being part of the hip ways of the 80's. It's just not his thing. Of all the young albums I've listened to and fallen in love with, Landing On Water is one that I keep on the shelf purely to say that I have collected it."
2,"Wow Neil, 23 years later a plane did land on water, and all survived","After today's miracle in New York, I immediately thought of this forgettable 1986 album. I still own it on vinyl. The one good tract is ""Touch the Night,"" a poor man's ""Like a Hurricane."" As New Jersey's biggest Neil Young fan, I half understand, but still wonder why, a minor Neil Young album title grabs my attention while I'm watching the US Airways plane floating south down the Hudson River on CNN. Secondly, I wonder whether Neil himself pondered the relevance while he watched from Australia -- he's currently there on tour. Finally, thirdly, and sadly, I did think about the poor souls on the plane. But they're alive. Hey hey, my my.And lastly, if you own the LP, you realize that there is a cool photo of Neil sitting in an airplane seat, a flotation device strapped to his chest, the plane ready to hit water, and Neil looks scared. Real scared."
1,Don't bother,"I tried to find something positive about this album, but I can't. The mid eighties were not kind to Neil, luckily his experimenting with synthesizers, etc. is over. Save your money and buy other Neil CD's."
4,Why is everybody complaining?,"everyone i know or don't says this album sucks and is deffinately not Young's best, but i don't know what everyone's complaining about. This album retains the same song writing quality as any Young album, if anything it's great exploration into things lost and things to come. Yes, i'd rather here him with his acoustic guitar or crazy horse but it shouldn't matter what style of music you use but the actual songs."
2,Neil goofing around....,Geez....What's Neil up to here? This isn't too good. If you think Neil should be backed by Toto you might enjoy this one. I hate to throw darts at the guy (cause he's great) but this sounds like he wants to be a pop star. This wouldn't fly on Star Search. Bottom Line: This cd is to rock music what etch-a-sketch is to art. You go Neil!
1,"Right up there with ""The Best of Uriah Heep""","Boy this is a bad album. It's really not even worth listening to after you've heard it once. There are a couple of good melodies in a couple of the songs, but nothing on here is completely a good song. My guess is that Mr. Young really wanted this album NOT to sell, so Geffen wouldn't make a lot of money off of it."
2,Even Neil doesn't recommend this one...,"I read the recent biography of Neil Young called Shakey...even he considers this one of his worst albums. The sound is terrible. The worst of 80's production technology. It all sounds like it's in a tin can which makes sense since basically the musicians didn't actually play together. There are a couple of good songs like ""Pressure"" but this one really doesn't stand the test of time."
1,Neil's absolute worst,"Let me start by saying that Neil Young is probably my all-time favorite rock-and-roll artist. I own thirty of his albums and still eagerly await each new release. But this turkey is the only Neil Young album I ever actually sold back used. I can not say a single good thing about it.Simply put, ""Landing On Water"" was a ghastly miscalculation by the master. How Neil could have thought that a collection of mediocre songs driven primarily by synthesizers was a good idea is beyond me. And while I have often been pleasantly surprised by some of his more unconventional projects (the Shocking Pinks, for example), my only reaction to this album was horror.If you want to hear Neil doing something interesting with synths, check out ""Trans."" Avoid this disaster at all costs!"
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS,"Sometimes ""Landing on water"" is on sale but even if this one was for free I wouldn't take it. It's so amazingly bad I can't find the words. So if you're unfamiliar with Neil Young and see this one on sale, and start to think that maybe it's time to explore Neil Young...RESIST! Do not touch this album (at least not as your first Neil Young) cause the risk is very high that you'll never look at another record by Mr. Young - and that would be a pity. Instead of this one you should get ""Harvest"", ""After the gold rush"" and ""Comes a time""."
1,AWFUL,"Landing on Water was nothing but a dissapointment. The songs were terrible, i can't even listen to it anymore. Even though you can buy it for next to nothing, you should save your money for the classics, Like Harvest, After the Goldrush, and Tonights the Night."
3,a minor record,"Reviewers are confronted opinions about this album. I would adopt a intermediate position. Is not so bad like Trans but is far from the best Young's records.If we take in account that Young has made records like Harvest, Rust never sleeps, Ragged Glory, Zuma, Sleep with angels or, maybe, Prairie Wind this is a minor record"
5,Works cleansed me out,Worked great used it many times for that bi-annual cleanse and never had any bad problems. Lots of pills to take but no different than the vitamins I take daily. Use a pill box and take morning and night and you should have no problem
4,Happy Holidays!,"""Christmas Stories"" is a collection of three of Charles Dickens' works. The most famous is ""A Christmas Carol."" Most of us are familiar with this story from Mr. Magoo, Disney or whomever. It is refreshing to read the original story that spawned the plays and the movies. Sometimes the between book and the movie, one disappoints. The book does not fail here.The other two stories are less well known, ""The Cricket on the Hearth"" and ""The Chimes."" I will not spoil the stories by revealing the plots, but I will say that ""The Chimes"" is a New Year's story.Dickens is a legendary storyteller and his skill shines through in these stories. This is a good seasonal reading. Start just before Christmas and end, with ""The Chimes"" on New Year's Eve. Happy Holidays!"
3,Great if you like Basses and Baritones,"This performance features nearly unbeatable performances by the mutlidimensional Christoff--easily the best Philip on records, the by turns powerful and lyric Gobbi, and especially Giulio Neri, whose black and almost dead tones for the Grand Inquisitor personify Verdi's distrust for the church. Stella portrays the royal aspects of her part well, but the voice sounds a little stiff in the passionate moments. The real concerns for this recording are the unacceptable wobbly Nicolai as Eboli (I've never heard a peformance which convinced me that she deserved an international career), and the stentorian but rather ugly Filippeschi, whose poor legato and clumsy phrasing are a detriment...too bad Di Stefano and Barbieri weren't the Carlos and Eboli, that would have improved this performance considerably."
3,"Abbreviated Opera, but Gobbi and Christoff Shine","I was disappointed that this version was an abbreviated version of Verdi's Don Carlo. However, the parts that were dropped in this performance did not affect the parts sung by Titto Gobbi and Boris Christoff, both of whom were truly magnificent in this recording. The rest of the cast was an operatic misfortune, so in the long run, the abbreviated version is prefferable. If you buy this recording, buy it for Titto Gobbi and Boris Christoff. They are worth listening to."
1,A shame,"One of the worst Don Carlo ever! Very abridged. Only three good singers: Christoff (Philip), Neri (Inquisitor) and Loretta di Lelio aka Mrs Franco Corelli (Tebaldo).------------------Cet enregistrement de Don Carlo réalisé en 1954 est srement un des plus mauvais. La version choisie est celle en quatre actes mais avec de nombreuses coupures : les airs sont souvent tronqués et de nombreux seconds couplets ont ainsi disparu ! Le chef est sans intért, les chanteurs aussi. Tout le monde, ou presque, s'ennuie. Les rescapés de ce massacre général sont Philippe II (Christoff qui n'a pas encore les tics insupportables et clownesques que nous lui connatrons) et un excellent Inquisiteur (Giulio Neri). Une curiosité : Tebaldo est chanté par Loretta di Lelio, l'implacable épouse du grand Franco, et elle chante fort bien ! Mais écouter Mme Corelli est-elle une raison suffisante pour se procurer ce lamentable Don Carlos ?"
2,For lovers of Christian Fiction only,"Clearly many people love this book so I am not going to denigrate their opinions.However, this book is very poorly written. The characters are extremely two-dimensional and the dialogue is weak. The author is not a good writer. What he does have, however, is a great imagination. I liked the story of this book and thought the hook (ie. Jesus cloned from the Shroud of Turin) was enticing.I think you would have to be a lover of Christian fiction to be blown away by this book. If you are not, this is an average thriller and not ""edge of your seat"" stuff. I am not feeling inclined to read the rest of the series and I feel slightly suckered that I bought this book based on the glowing reviews which are found everywhere else, it seems, on Amazon.com."
3,"Impressive ideas, unimpressive writing.","The sheer volume of research and the magnitude and breadth of the story's scope are impressive, and the plot devices and twists are creative and entertaining. Surely, the premise has been done before but perhaps never as ambitiously or completely discussed since the Greatest Story Ever Told. It's just that BeauSeigneur isn't a fiction writer, really. His characters lack depth, his dialogue is contrived and lacks a normal conversational flow present in much better writers. I keep thinking as I read this, that if BeauSeigneur just plopped his notes and research on Stephen King's lap and said, ""make this work"", we'd have three (or if you know King, six) marvelous books of well-written prose *and* some really creative twists. It's certainly far-reaching in its scope, but I don't think this former speechwriter was up to the task of writing it down. Given the other reviews, I'd say my opinion is unpopular, but I'd do readers a disservice by offering fake praise."
3,Good writing and interesting story,"I enjoyed the book and I thought the concept was interesting but I did find myself wincing a little at the language. I tend to read all books of all kinds, but when I read a ""Christian"" book, I don't expect to find bad language. I read Christian books because I want to be edified spiritually, grow in the knowledge of the Lord and hopefully come away from the book a little wiser, even with fiction. I just want others to be aware of what it contains. I may still move on to the second in the series."
1,NOT biblically-based reading,"I bought this book because it was recommended along with the Left Behind series. Buyer beware: if you are looking for an end-times story that is solidly based on biblical prophecy, this is not the book for you. The author takes certain biblical references out of context and weaves them into his own New Age interpretation of ""all roads leading to God"". He even blatantly makes up lies that seekers who aren't familiar with the Bible might swallow. For example, he says that the apostle John was the true betrayer of Christ, not Judas. I would hate to see anyone be led astray by the theology in this book. If you enjoy Bible-based reading, stick with the Left Behind series."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"This is not a bad series, but I think perhaps I was going into it expecting too much. The reviews here have been so strong and so overwhelmingly positive that I was expecting a masterpiece. I didn't get it. The only two End Times novels I've ever read before this was Left Behind and We All Fall Down. This is certainly better than Left Behind (To be fair, I've only read the first one)but doesn't come anywhere near the quality of We all Fall Down. I baught all three books at one time and wished that I hadn't. This is a facinating premise, but that's all. There's no real exploration of Christian life and I certainly don't feel like I have a better understanding of my faith. This certainly didn't illuminate me or help me in that area. The characters are also fairly unengaging. Again, this is quite a bit better than Left Behind, but that's not really saying much. Perhaps if you read it with lowered expectations you will enjoy it more than I did."
4,why no mention of the internet?,"overall, i thoroughly enjoyed In His Image, and purchased the 2 sequels prior to finishing it. what kept me from rating it ""5 stars"" was one very glaring ommision---->where was the internet in this book?i found it absolutely preposterous that decker and christopher had never heard of the KDP prior to arriving in israel. if, in fact, 144,000 psychic people were running around the middle east with red letters stamped on their foreheads, one wouldn't need a cabbie's explanation as to the who/what/when/where/why of it all! in reality, the internet would have been abuzz with such news; throughout the book, i consistently marvelled that the main characters neither mentioned nor used a tool that most of us use daily. wierd!"
2,TWO BOOKS/ONE GOOD ONE!,"I bought two books from Amazon, BeauSeigneur's IN HIS IMAGE and A.T. Nicholas' THE FIST OF GOD. I could hardly finish IN HIS IMAGE. I'll buy the next one in hopes of improvement. But I was greatly pleased with THE FIST OF GOD. The story was moving and interesting, and the plot was well done. It could have been better,but not bad for a first novel. There's too much cussing and violence in this book for some, but I can overlook it for the better of the message. There's a great message for all of us in Nicholas' novel. Read it. IN HIS IMAGE was OK, looking for better work on number two. The Fist of God a solid (three and a half star). Can't wait for his next attempt."
1,Unoriginal,"This is a zerox of the ""left behind"" books. And for that matter of every other doom and gloom end of the world book. Except the difference between those and this is that this one is badly written. It has a ton of editing mistakes. I can't believe the publisher let them slip. But when I say it's badly written I'm not talking about poor grammar. I'm talking about a horribly mismatched story that is that disappoints. The dialogue is horrible. Kind of like the dialogue in ""Attack of The Clones"". Ugh. I struggled through this baby hoping it would get better and getting ever more disappointed. I don't think this author should quit his day job. I don't recommend it."
2,Over the Top!,"James Beauseigneur's Christ Clone trilogy could have been SO good! The plot is intriguing, but author's need to use every ""end-time"" prophecy was distracting and weak. Also, the stupidity of the characters, both named and un-named, takes away from the plausibility of the storyline. For example, when ""millions"" of people in all parts of the world mysteriously die all at the same time, bio-terrorism is assumed to be the cause - NO ONE suggests the possibility of ""Rapture"" even after no cause is found. Please! I can't believe that someone, somewhere wouldn't start shouting ""The end of the world is near"" at this point! I cancelled my order for the 2 sequels as soon as I turned the last page of the novel, which I had to force myself to finish!"
5,"Finally, out of the ghetto of the evangelical subculture . .","Finally, out of the ghetto of the evangelical subculture, comes a refreshing, well thought out, and methodically researched look at the end of the age. And not since, C.S. Lewis have we seen such creativity and imagination in its presentation. Bravo! More! -J. Nordmoe, Vanderbilt University Library"
5,One Giant Leap for Christian Fiction,"Intelligent accurate fiction with a Christian world-view: Is The Christ Clone Trilogy a new genre or has Christian fiction, in a single leap, both come of age and surpassed the quality of most secular fiction? Whichever it is, James BeauSeigneur has established himself as both the creator and master with his first three books. The tremendous scope of the novel and the way that BeauSeigneur weaves fact, fiction and faith is extraordinary. I eagerly await whatever BeauSeigneur puts his awesome talent to next."
2,Yawn.....,"After being left hanging by Left Behind series I was desperate for a conclusion to an end times story. I had heard that this trilogy was exciting and well done so I bought all three books. I forced myself to read the first book, yawn. It laid the groundwork for the story, but it was boring. The second book was a bit better, still no real rush. The third book had promise, but ultimately was a race to the end. The climax was a huge disappointment. I'm giving the books to the used book store. Not something I'd recommend."
5,Mesmerizing,"The Christ Clone Trilogy is is a taut, intense, adrenaline-rushing techno-thriller that leaves its readers gasping for breath between pages. The plot is rich with twists and turns waiting to jump out when you least expect them. BeauSeigneur's characters are well developed with believable strengths and very human flaws. The dialogue is smart and believable and occasional humorous twists allow a smile through the tension. The trilogy is well conceived and meets every criteria for a plausible, engaging mystery, regardless of your theological beliefs. Reminiscent of Tom Clancy, Stephen King and C.S. Lewis all rolled into one, BeauSeigneur's style of story-telling stacks up admirably to the best in the business. I was totally mesmerized by this read and was not able to stop until the conclusion of the third book."
4,a book worth reading,"I have just finished this trilogy for the 2nd time. I find it funny to hear people compare it to left behind. That's like comparing apples to oranges. I thought the overall books were so much more cerebral. The only character I invested in was Decker Hawthorn so did not miss a deeper characterization from peripheral characters. I had some issues with some of the theology, but felt the author more than explained his reasons in his footnotes. The few issues I had were more about the time lines of the tribulation and not the story or events that occured. I found the trilogy as a whole to be a very satisfying complete work. I will admit that I was a touch bored in book two with the set up and description of the meteors. Overall high praise"
5,TCCT is SO MUCH BETTER than Left Behind!,"I stopped reading the Left Behind series after #4 (Soul Harvest). I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't. I also read (actually started reading) We All Fall Down, but there the foul language was SO EXCESSIVE I couldn't keep going. Finally I read the books of The Christ Clone Trilogy (why do I feel like Goldilocks here?) and they were ""just right!"" Actually they're GREAT! So if you're tired of Buck and Rayford playing James Bond, and all the females in the Left Behind world cooing, get The Christ Clone Trilogy."
1,Very Boring and not Scriptural at all.,"I got this book based on the overwhelming popular reviews that I read here on Amazon.com. Please do not get this book if you are into end times fiction. I could not even finish this book because it was boring and it was not scriptural. For all the people who says the ""Left Behind"" series is awful, then they really need to read this book. The author is way off base with his ideas."
1,I was fooled by the positive reviews!!!!,"I can't believe I bought all three books!!! I could just kick myself!!! I started to read book one and I got about half way through. I kept reading, hoping that it would get better but it never did. This book had very short segments of interesting reading followed by whole pages and pages of boring super way too detailed stretches of reading. I love reading but this book turned it into a chore for me. I was definitely fooled by all the positive reviews, never again will I buy all the books in a series before reading book one. I know! I know! My bad! I would not recommend this book! Please stay away!"
4,"Good, thought provoking book!","Good book. Very thought provoking, offering explanations and theories you've probably never thought about. Brought together in a very orderly fashion, great ending! Looking forward to part two!"
2,"Hardly inspirational, barely readable","Considering myself spiritual AND literate may make me a commoditiy, but I think hardly a rare one. This thinly veiled telling of John's Apocalypse appeals to neither side of me. An addition to the growing list of fundamentalist novels, it will have appeal to the Wednesday night study group, but I fear, not to many more. As a Christian, I found the pseudo-scientific approach to Christ's return insulting. (Do we really think that He will come again by being cloned from cells scraped off the shroud of Turin? Really!) As a reader, I thought the writing too weak to grab me in its own right. (I never learn enough about the manchild to really care about him.) I see that it has been revised to a second edition. This must be a unique event; a novel rewritten to make the story more accurate. Per haps my expectations were too high, but I fear that Christian Literature has not found its Faulkner. Read this if neither mind nor soul need exercise,"
1,NOT in His image.,"As a big fan of the ""Left Behind"" series by Jenkins and LaHaye I thought that I hit it big when I saw another series of books that I thought delt with a Christian topic. I sure was wrong! THESE BOOKS ARE NOT BASED ON CHRISTIANITY! Not only that, but the writing is horrible."
5,MUCH MORE THAN EXPECTED,"Absolutely a MUST read series. I've read all three books and literally could not put them down.MUCH, MUCH better than the Left Behind series which frankly is getting a bit too long now. However, BeauSeigneur crafts a story based on information of today. He hits all the major issues and does it without preaching or becoming parochial. I have been telling everyone to get the books and so now I will tell EVERYONE to get the books. They are well worth reading.I want more of this author and the sooner the better."
5,One word: Awesome,"This trilogy is a must read for all! I have been an avid reader of the ""Left Behind"" books and when I saw that these books were recommended in addition to or in lieu of the ""Left Behind"" series, I had to order them to see what all the hype was about. Well, I have read the entire Trilogy in just 4 days. I could not put it down. Word to the wise...you have to buy the whole trilogy at the same time AND you CANNOT stop at book 2. Book 3 is where it all comes together. I just finished book 3 two hours ago, and I cried, laughed and felt this incredible peace all at the same time. As a Christian, this trilogy has soldified my beliefs beyond measure. For the non-beleiver, this trilogy will definitely show them the Christ's love in a whole new way. I must admit that stopping at book two both for the believer and non-believer is detrimental to the growth of faith, so make sure you read all the books!These books have been three of the best books I have EVER read!"
5,Amazing once you get by the first book....,"Don't get me wrong, I thought the first book was well written and pretty interesting, but once I finished I was kind of sick. I thought the author was going in a very new age direction, totally opposed to a Christian message. I even put the series down and didn't read anymore because I thought the message was skewed. On a whim, I picked up the second book. Once it hit me what BeauSeigneur was doing, all I could think was ""Boy am I stupid"" and ""Brilliant!"". From that point forward, I couldn't put the books down. They were absolutely fabulous. Well written, interesting and fast paced.If you are reading this as a Christian and you get frustrated with the first book....keep going. Trust me. You will not be disappointed. The same idea that trapped me also got my father in-law. Have fun."
3,Good series...kinda disappointing,"There was a lot of hype, but the series didn't live up to it. It's good, don't get me wrong, but it's all just so...typical. The books do some great debating about beliefs, presenting both sides of the argument, but in the end it's still the same message. If you're not a Christian, you're going to Hell. Looks like there's still no hope for unbelievers in the literary world. Sigh. Read Matthew Reilly books. They're cool. By the way, vampires are cool too. That is all."
5,You Must Read It More Than Once!,"I have read The Christ Clone Trilogy three times and each time I have discovered greater and greater depth to the story and the characters. And each time I have found clues and bits of the puzzle that I missed on earlier readings. BeauSeigneur is an absolute master of the craft. I'll wait a few months, but I WILL read these books again!"
1,a HUGE let-down. . .,"It sure is a good thing I never actually bought this book - I borrowed it from the library after reading 5-star reviews on amazon. This is awful writing if I've ever seen it. The characters, as mentioned by scores of others, are one-dimensional - the author tells you what happens rather than bringing you into the situation and letting you see and feel for yourself. I am a fan of the Left Behind series, though I find the series to be quite long (it's not even finished yet!), at least you can connect with the characters and feel for them. The swearing also turned me off, it is unneccessary and does not belong in Christian fiction.Do not buy this book - if you really want to read it, see if you can borrow it, but DO NOT waste your money on poor writing, awful editing, and Christian fiction that is not even based on Sciptures. Read Left Behind if you want true-to-Scripture, edifying reading."
5,An amazing experience!,"In His Image is the first book of a fantastic, horrifying, and powerfully moving trilogy. I was deeply touched by some of the character's insights on God and why we are here. I didn't want it to end. Bravo!"
5,In this case the second time's the charm!!!!,"At the urging of an excellent author, I gave this book another try--I am so glad I did!! Bound and determined to make it all the way through this time, I found myself unable to put it down--read it in two days and am so thankful I have the next two waiting on my nightstand!!Mr. BeauSeigneur has written a smart, insightful, story of the endtimes that is perfect reading for this time in our nation's history!!"
3,Revised or not revised - that is the question,"I had orginally found out about this trilogy in the late 1990s when looking for information about the Left Behind series. About two years ago, I stumbled upon it again and decided to purchase Book 1, published sometime after 2001.I was surprised and somewhat disappointed to find that it had been revised to make it more current by including such things as 9/11 and George W. Bush as president. This made it hard for me to get into the book knowing that it had been originally published prior to these events. So I am going to look for a cheap used copy published prior to 2001 to see if I enjoy it better. But if one prefers an updated version, buy any that are printed after 2001"
4,A good start for the trilogy,"Though I think the first one is not the best of the trilogy, this book is very good. I bought it just to have something different to read, but when I got it I couldn't stop reading it until I finished. I found that I had been reading the whole night. Be careful not to start reading in the office or in public places, you'll find yourself bound to your chair until you finish.After that I couldn't help it and bought the others.I would like to see this trilogy translated to spanish!!!"
1,Profane and Inane!,"Devoted Christians should definitely stay away not only from this book but also from this author... better he should spend the time trying to improve his writing skills and reading the Good Book (if there's no profanity in the Bible why should there be any in this series?). This is an amateurish title, as is evident by the fact the publisher is a no-name. Stay away if you value the Lord's Word as well as a sense of good writing."
5,Oh Praise JESUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Before reading this book, i was an atheist. Hardcore atheist. But then, I read the book due to a friend incessantly begging me to. I was totally blown away. The characters were accurate reprensentations of everyday people in a world that is created by God. It moved me, I'm seriously considering a christian life now, NO MORE PROMISCUITY FOR ME, THANKS JESUS!"
1,SALTING THE MINE!!,"This book was a huge disappointment, especially since Amazon's ""customers recommendeded"" it as the perfect addItion to or substitute for virtually EVERY book on the best seller list -- fiction and nonfiction. If you peruse the titles, it is the perfect addition to Star Wars, Star Trek, The Left Behind Series, all visionary fiction, and a lot more! Sorry, I don't buy it. Hard to believe that real fans would read that range of books. Whether the author is behind this or some misguided fans, I don't know. But, it sure seems sleazy for a book with a supposedly ""righteous"" theme."
3,Not bad,"Not a bad book, but not good enough to convince me to purchase the subsequent books at the prices they are currently listed (roughly $10 for the second book). My main complaint with this book is how often the author skipped time. He would write a problem or major discovery into the plot and end the chapter. I would eagerly turn the page only to find ""eight years later"" as the first words of the next chapter. The author would then write about what had happened from the characters' memories. I find this extremely annoying and a cheap trick to get around the difficulty of resolving a conflict. If it happens once, I don't mind too much. However, it happened 4-5 times in the first book alone."
1,Not Worth Your Time!,"Not only was this very poorly written, the theology was very anti-Christian. God is presented as a selfish, arrogant deity, John the disciple as a traitor, and Judas Iscariot as the only true friend of Christ. Do not waste the time reading this!"
3,Christ Clone TRiligy book 1,STarted off really interesting but soon got to much into politics and world order. I was looking for something that was more religous based and si fi. Not entertaining enough to keep my interest.
1,Demise of a good story,"This series appeals as another of the ""end times"" novels and is a good story, as it goes. The reason for only 1 star is that the author, in pursuing ""realism,"" has his characters use profanity throughout the book. As Christians we are to keep our language pure, and even if only the non-Christians use profanity, the reader must still experience it. With violence, the author would be telling us ABOUT something evil, but with profanity, he is committing it against us. Too bad--I was hoping for something appropriate for Christians."
2,Interesting concept but poor writing,"I ordered this book after finishing the last Left Behind book. Despite the strange bi-polar reviews, I still gave it a shot, because of the idea. Unfortunately, an idea is not enough. The writing is strictly third rate. I give it two stars for the idea...."
5,Book 1 of 3,"When my grandmother first introduced me to the left behind series, I was ecstatic. However that series is constantly declining in quality. When I decided to give this series a chance I didn't know what to expect. It is now my personal belief that this trilogy far outshines anything else on the market to date! It makes the Left Behind Series seem like science fiction with its attention to reality. By the books! Forget left behind, you won't be disappointed."
1,Read The Omen,Let's not write another Omen. This is another unoriginal cheat sheet disguised as a book. This one is extremely bad. If your going to copy at least be original and interesting when doing it. I have read alot of rehashed stuff that works if it's written well. This isn't.
4,"Alone Good, As trilogy not so good!!!","After reading the first two books I was very happy with my purchase. The story was great, the imagery was good, and it was deffinately controversial. I'd say worth reading except I don't want to promote the third."
1,In His Image,"I ordered this book because I had read the Left Behind series which follows the Book of Revelation without error, in my judgement, and was anxious to read another approach to this subject. It was a huge disappointment to me because, as a Christian, I found this near blasphemy. I was uncomfortable reading the book with such distortions of Biblical doctrine. Though I realized this book was not a historical account, I wasn't prepared for the twists and turns, which were written convincingly well, thinking all the time about those who read this but aren't well read in the Scriptures. The danger ever present in my mind was the harm that could be done to a person seeking spiritual significance when they are not founded in sound doctrine. What would such notions do to earnest seekers?I cannot recommend this book."
2,Wish I hadn't bought it.,"This book is totally wack. The research was impressive, but that's about it. The only reason I even finished was because I bought the book and felt obligated to finish it- I'm not even interested in finishing the trilogy. Decades are skipped and connection to the characters is non-existant. On the back of the book one reviewer wrote, ""C.S. Lewis couldn't have done it better."" C.S. Lewis wouldn't do it in the first place."
5,Pennsauken's errors,"The previous reviewer (a reader from Pennsauken, NY) quotes a line from IN HIS IMAGE. He even does it correctly. But he fails to notice that the book states that the narrative starts ""20 years ago."" Thus the ""then-current method(s)"" refers to dating methods available in 1983 not what was done in 1988. The reviewer also fails to notice that on the page BEFORE the quoted line, BeauSeigneur himself refers to the 1988 C-14 tests, both in the narrative AND in a footnote.The Christ Clone Trilogy is fiction, but it is among the best researched an presented fiction written in any genre. Before the reader from Pennsauken slams a book, he should do more than skim the text."
5,"Not just the ""Enola gay'....","In ""Inferno"", published 2000, it is projected that B-29 firebombings killed more than both atomic raids,yet the public is not aware. Inferno complements this title,..an excellent summary of role B-29's..Air Force-Gen. Hap Arnold,& Gen. Curtis Lemay policy to destroy the so-called ""cottage industry"" of Japan."
4,A pretty good work on the non-technical side of sysadmining,"This work is a good one on the non-technical side of system adminsitration. It does not deal with stuff like HOW to install a system, but the WHYs, such as WHY you want to properly document your installations.This sort of work has been needed for a long time, since ""The Keys to Successful Unix System Management"" went out of print. However, this work may be a bit too academic for many admins. They might find the recent ""Practice of System and Network Administration"" to be a bit better. If you can afford both, do so."
4,"Peter Salus, Login - June 2000","Peter Salus, Login - June 2000 Another winner! I keep Nemeth et al. and AEleen Frisch at hand for referencing the systems admin tasks we all need to do. Burgess' fine book is something ``completely different.'' It is a well-articulated introduction to a corpus of guiding principles for systems administrators. And as we live in a world of heterogeneity, Burgess ``covers'' Unix, Unix-like, DOS, Windows, Mac, Amiga, and NT systems.Burgess says that he wants to express a sound and logical way to approach networked systems. While I can find nits (that's a reviewers job, isn't it?), I consider this an important book. More and more talk of certification can only lead to a body of knowledge and a set of tenets that are 'required.'I think that Burgess will become part of the required reading for future (and current) systems administrators."
1,This guy is a complete ningkumpoop!,This book is completely filled with nonsense. Did this guy ever take any classes or instruction on what is he writing about? What qualifications does he have? Spend you money on a real networking book from a qualified author.
1,Product is not as described,"My poor rating is based not on the actual product, but the fact the product I received is not the classical collection as described in Amazon's product details. Rather it's a collection of popular holiday favorites performed by the Montgomery Smith [saxophone] Quintet and published by Reflections. Songs include ""I'll Be Home for Christmas"", ""Christmas Time Is Here"", ""What Child Is This"", ""Let It Snow"", ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"", ""O Christmas Tree"", ""Happy Holidays"", ""The Christmas Song"", ""What Are You Doing New Years Eve"", ""Silver Bells"", ""Merry Christmas Baby"", ""I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus"", ""Winter Wonderland"", ""White Christmas"". This product is only available through third parties. Be sure to verify the product with seller before you order."
3,Stanleu mini tripod flashlight keychain,Well when it arrived it was a little smaller than I had imagined. I guess for its size the light ourput is ok. Its more of a novelty than a serious mini flashlight. My wife thought it was a cute little thing so now its on her keychain.
3,its cute...but i wish they would pack carefully,"got two, one worked great..one was already on..and battery near deadthey should pay attention and make sure both items are identical expecially if they are they same...gives a bad reputation."
2,Good Idea Bad Execution,"The price is very appealing and the functionality it promises is great. The actual light is good and strong given the size.Sadly it doesn't deliver on much else. Contrary to the key-chain ring attach to the flash light, DO NOT Carry on key-chain it is by far too fragile, the little tripod legs break off WAY TOO easy. I made this mistake and it lasted me three days, before I was down to one leg on the tripod. If you buy it, I would recommend you just leave it in a convenient safe place i.e. the car, back pack, locker, or toolbox. This item bordered on novelty item in it's build quality. I have used Stanley larger tripods and those are in deed built sturdy. If you haven't purchased this item, i wouldn't recommend you do."
5,"Look Ma, no hands!","Great product to use when needing to shine kight on a particular area without the use of your hands. Also, the ability to split the unit into three different flaslights is very useful. The batteries also last a long time."
3,"Innovative/useful, but not durable enough for a keychain",I bought this thinking I would be able to have it on my daily use keychain. However I'm certain the small plastic parts would not hold up to that. It still is a handy gadget which I leave in my electronics tool box to provide light on the small soldering projects and the like.
3,"So cute, yet functional","Much smaller than I anticipated, but it really does work. Very functional if its size doesn't make it forgettable."
4,Neat Light!,"Neat light! Gives great, bright beam, the tripod legs are sturdy, and the adjustment for the head is firm.Only two issues I've had:1: It's a bit big for a keychain, and it's easy to accidentally flick the light on after a couple weeks of pocket use.2: When the tripod is deployed, the base of the keychain is juuust long enough that it's only ever sitting on two legs, so it isn't quite as stable as it could be.I got this as a gift. I'm not certain I'd buy it for myself, but it's quite nice to have."
1,"Looks cool and useful, but it's really cheap and flimsy","I bought this flashlight thinking it would be of equal or similar quality of the larger Stanley Tripod flashlights. I was very wrong. It is very flimsy, and cheap. The keychain part sticks down so low, that it won't stand up on it's own like it is supposed to. It does have a nice bright led light, but if you are looking for a small compact led light, there are better ones out there. If you like the tripod feature, I do highly recommend the other two Stanley Tripod flashlights. I own both the ""aa"" and the ""aaa"" sizes and they are great."
1,Beware! Stripped Down!,"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that what I received in the mail (see photos above) wasn't the same product as pictured on this web page. Their photo looks like a miniature version of the other Stanley Tripod Flashlights. The things I got in the mail were cheap stripped down plasticy versions! Then when I went to try to return the item with ""Item Isn't What I Ordered"" they weren't going to issue a refund. If you try to return it because you're disappointed like I was, use the last reason something like ""Item Didn't Match What Listed on Webpage"". The crappy thing is that I had ordered these for Valentine's gifts for my two boys & had to send them back because they would've broken them within minutes. Do I dare order the minis that aren't a keychain instead? Shame on Stanley & Amazon for the deception!"
1,Save Your Money For Something Worth it,I have been using it for over a month now ... just to make this simple :at first the material felt good enough and the light was good for a small closed areaBut now it doesn't light any more .. it's more like a flashing thingyi Thing the warranty would have been useful for me except that i don't live in the US Right nowbut to be fair it's real small and effective in some situations.
4,works,"I bought this as a Christmas tag on my Father in laws present, he really got a kick out of, It does work and the light shines pretty good for it being small. the legs fold in for easier storage."
1,Not what it looks like in the picture.,I literally broke it opening the package!! One of the little legs came off - no lens and not very bright anyways. Saved the batteries and threw in trash.
3,"Portable, tiny, sturdy 3 1/2","4 stars b/c 3x batteries of a hard to find type LR41 (atleast 3 starters included/installed, they do have a good life in LEDs too)3 stars b/c product NOT AS PICTURED, legs on arrived product were cheap plastic (thin) lever stands, not metal cylinder stands with ends as shown by vendor(s) and body/yellow lines not present, even tho 95-113 on package label+1/2 star for light being quite bright! It's not labelled, but possibly 30 to 60 lumens for a little guy"
4,i love it not as the first picture,i got less that 3 day it really cool but it doesnt have a glass or plastic cover on the flash light where it cover the led and the legs are different more plastic it feel like it can brake easy but it a key chain they break really easy will like if the inventor of this flash light put magnet on the legs so it can stick on to mettle so when im working on my car i can just stick on somewhere to use.
4,"Great, if you get what you order","What I received was not the Stanley flashlight pictured but a cheap imitation. The LED is plenty bright; however, the flashlight broke within seconds of removing it from the package. The tripod legs were a molded plastic, not the chrome ones in the pictures, and one snapped off when trying to open it. Also, the key chain portion is in the way of the tripod making that feature doubly useless. I couldn't post an image to the review, but I was able to find it on this link.[...]I was able to get a hold of the real flashlight pictured and it is of a much higher quality. The legs are much sturdier. It has a much better designed reflector around the LED that focuses the light. You can rotate the head without feeling like you are going to break it off. The key chain itself is even a better quality.I suppose that is the one issue of online shopping. Beware of imitations."
2,Too small to use,Cute gag gift but not useful. Look at the key ring in the photo to get an idea of the size. The tripod is too small to be usable; it just adds bulk to your pocket.
1,"Junk, Do not buy","I could not believe the quality of this item from Shanley, which, Is a very good Company. I would of been embarrassed to even of sent it.When I tried to turn it on it would not work.Please Stanley, Please get ride of the person responsible for this produce.Been awhile before I rated this produce, Just couldn't rate it, I was so dissatisfied."
1,Broke on the first day.,Sent it back to amazon for a refund. Cheap. The switch is what broke and couldn't turn it on/off.
1,Tri-Pod Keychain,"Beam is just not bright enough. I have had smaller keychaing with brighter beams.Otherwise, neat little light"
2,"Great idea, but poorly executed","Bought this to put on my teen's backpack. Keychain arrived and new out of the package the keychain links were broken. I fixed the links for him and within one day, one of the legs broke off. Not at all impressed with the quality. The full size light was great. Keychain not worth the $$! Gave it two stars, as the light itself is great."
1,brok in 5 minutes,cheap not worth the time to return.. but I thought because it was Stanley that it would be good quality
4,I love learning Greek with Machen,"I am pleased with the book. Machen provides excercises which are incredibly helpful in learning Greek. Each lesson is broken up effectively making it easy to follow. However, I found it necessary to receive instruction from a teacher along with each lesson."
3,"Solid text, nothing fancy","I learned NT Greek from Machen's text in an intensive 4-week course. The text is old-school, but thorough. If you can handle having paradigms tossed at you in an entirely businesslike manner, and you can get someone to explain the subtleties of participles, then this is text can be a fast introduction.A word of warning: Machen follows the classical tradition of teaching grammar by aphorism in the exercises at the end of each chapter. The exercises tend to reflect Machen's worldview: that of an embattled evangelical feeling marginalized in an increasingly modernistic denomination. Example: ""If you do not receive our testimony, you will not be saved."""
2,TOO OLD FOR THE MODERN DAY AMERICAN,"Today times are changing, and because of this I can only say that so is the way koina Greek is taught in seminaries and bible colleges. Machen represents a hero to evangelicalism of the past. However, I truly believe that his grammer is out of date. I think that the leading tool for teaching NT Greek is William Mounce's Basics of Biblical Greek. There are probably less than 10% of colleges and seminaries that even still use Machen. If we are going to make Greek more easier to comprehend and attain, then other sources than Machen's ought to be used"
4,a true classic,"I am partial to Machen because I first learned Greek with his book, but the more I use this text to teach Greek to others, the more impressed I become. The genius is the organization and the exercises. No grammar does a better job of systematically leading one through Greek and the exercises are wonderful at reenforcing the vocabulary and paradigms. This book is great for reviewing or refreshing Greek and is perfect for teaching children, again because of the exercises.Machen's writing style is succinct if not eliptical, and this is the polar opposite to Mounce's user-friendly, wordy text, but its nice that it is small and you don't need a separate workbook. I would recommend that you buy both Machen and Mounce. The only reason I give it four stars is that no grammar is perfect and you really need to work through several. Machen is also to be honored for defending the faith against liberalism and he belongs in every Greco-phile's library."
2,Go Elsewhere,"This one just doesn't cut it. The sound quality is muddy and it doesn't even vaguely hold my interest. Even if you love Nine Pound Hammer, avoid this one."
4,"The More I listen, The More I like It!","Dave Mackenzie's 1995 release has been re-released this year as ""the all new"" Slender Man Blues. In actuality, the release is identical to the earlier version and that's a good thing. The CD showcases Mackenzie as a witty songwriter and an accomplished blues musician who plays with a hint of Nashville. Some of the songs bring to mind the lyrical style of Rick Estrin of Little Charlie and the Nightcats. The majority of the disc is acoustic based complete with slide guitar and mandolin. The disc is an enjoyable listen and a pleasant change of pace from the blues rock genre."
5,Good Instructional Video,This is actually a really good DVD. It teaches you how to do the moves in a fun way. Highly recommended.
4,Aerobic workout without the chatter,"As someone who has a drawer full of exercise videos, I have a few favorites that I use most often. The ones I choose have the least amount of instruction and talking since, after the first or second time through them, the talking is a distraction. I enjoyed the Dance a GoGo DVD because I like the music and choreography, it's a good aerobic workout and I can choose from three workouts. I particularly like that there is no instruction. I can see what the dancers do and do my best to imitate them. It's fun and a workout I will likely add to my list of favorites. Indeed, the dancers are quite sexy and sure to capture the attention of any man in the room."
2,DANCE A GO-GO,There could have been more instructions as the moves were so fast it was hard to follow. The dance moves should be slower so you can watch and do them easier.
4,Provocative yet Entertaining,"Although there are many facets of this book worth mentioning, I feel that Hofstadter's analysis of the evolution of the Agrarian myth to be most interesting.Also, Hofstadter's ""The Age of Reform"" is (in my opinion) extremely broad and philosophical in context. Written in 1955, this Pulitzer Prize winning work traces the development of Populism and the beginnings of Progressivism from the 1890's to the rise of WWI. However, this book is in my opinion ""primarily a study of political thinking and of political moods"" and, therefore, suffers from a major weaknesses. Put simply Hofstadter's book is largely devoid of primary regional sources, and his work pays lip service to the crucial values and strategies of key Populist leaders. I recommend Lawrence Goodwyn's account over Hofstadter for this reason...otherwise, a well written and intellectual achievement...worth a look."
5,Great stuff!,"I use this spray whenever I empty and clean my litter boxes. It smells great, but the best part is that it leaves a sort of non-stick coating on the surface of the box! It keeps the litter from sticking so bad to the bottom when you're scooping, especially older boxes that are getting scratched up and it eliminates the odor that gets trapped in all those scratches."
4,Stink Free brand litter box deoderant,"This is meant to cover up urine and stool smells, and I am all for that! Just be aware that it is actually spraying powder-smells like baby powder, and it is not good to breath in. Keep kitties and face away for spraying and let it settle before you come back. Best use for this is to ""season"" a new little box--fills in porous areas to prevent nasties from sinking into plastic litter boxes."
1,Unoriginal and superficial.,"This book adds practically nothing to the financial literature. The first part of the book is a Peter Lynch rip-off, talking about how we should only invest in things we understand, and use our knowledge of particular sectors to make money. The discussions of fundamental and technical analysis are so superficial as to be practically worthless. The author's assertion that it's easy to tell when a stock has bottomed or topped is ludicrous--if it were that easy I'd be on my yacht right now instead of writing this. The remainder of the book essentially talks about how analyst's reports are not to be trusted, which is very true but certainly not a novel concept. Readers would be far better served by buying Peter Lynch's first two books and/or the first Motley Fook book in my opinion."
4,"An excellent ""how-to"" for independent investors.","This is a great book for individuals who think they are ready to break away from reliance on the big brokerage houses. Mr. Siris gives detailed advice on how to effectively use the internet to gather the ""intelligence"" needed to make wise decisions. The book also contains a variety of tips for both the technical and value investor. Overall, I found this book to be very enlightening."
2,"Tedious analogy, too much market timing","The guerrilla analogy gets exceedingly tedious. And despite claims of buy-and-hold philosophy, it is very oriented toward market timing and rather frequent trading. I'll take the Motley Fool & related any day."
1,Did not enjoy,"This book had no meaning. I have talked to others about this horrible piece of writting, and they all agree. Siris does not deserve to have this book published."
5,An excellent mix of latin rhythms,"All twelve songs of this CD are great, you will find all kind of instruments mixed together to create a complex, but very nice sound. Guaco is a Venezuelan innovative band that mixes salsa, jazz, rock, and other rhythms creating their own style. Check out, ""El sueño de Simón"" (featuring Simón Díaz) and their new version of ""Así son boncó"" included in this CD"
4,another side of Chris & Cosey,"White Stains is an awesome mini album from TGT(the genetic terrorists)! It is more experimental than Chris & Cosey'smore electronic dance sound. If you're a fan, this is a must in your collection. It may remind one of early works of Noise Unit.Favorite tracks include: TGT (Anthem) and Deactivated."
5,The Best Book on Health!,I believe Dr. Don Colbert is THE BEST doctor ever! He has so much knowledge and yet when you read this book you will sense his caring heart as well. I love this book and actually have given it as a gift to my friends. I know own 2 of these same books so I can pass them around too. It is worth your money! GREAT book!
1,Unhappy,I ordered this book a month ago and have still not received this book! I would like a refund!
4,Swimmng chair,it needed longer noodlesThe noodles keep coming out But I enjoyed it after I but longer one in it and I sat better
3,Loud and a grate single with more hot songs,I love this cd and I play it over and over again I have my favorite parts stuck in my head. I say this is a must get if you like there song brackish but are not sure about the rest of the songs so dont want to buy the cd.
5,A Listening Experience,I can't recommend this CD enough. The music is full of praise and worship and you can't help but get caught up in their melodious message. I'm very picky with music and I'm fortunate enough that I didn't have to use the skip button once. An excellent buy if you truly love gospel music and love a wonderful listening experience.
1,"another miss fire at the scooby series,andPLEASE get rid of that brat scrappy doo","first and formost let me say this,SCRAPPY-DOO IS THE WORST CREATION THAT HAS EVER BEEN PUT IN A CARTOON. I BLAME HIM FOR THE DEATH OF THE SATURDAY MORINING CARTOONS!!!!not part of the real scobby this is yet another cheap rip-off that only has shaggy,scooby,and that brat scrappy teaching at a school for monsters????(the scooby we all know would never even get close to this one. THE WORST!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Casey Kasem probably doesn't list this one in his resume,"Kids will probably love this movie--parents will probably find it unbearable. There does appear to be a plot, if one can stand to watch it that long. I suspect that Casey Kasem would be embarrassed to be associated with this."
1,Caution! A Scrappy Doo Movie.,"I did not realize that this DVD features Scrappy Doo, Scooby Doo's nephew, or else I would not have purchased it. I strongly prefer the traditional Scooby Doo gang and dislike Scrappy Doo. This is the worst Scooby Doo movie that I've ever seen and I do not recommend it.My family's favorite Scooby Doo movies are the ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You?"" Complete DVD Seasons 1 and 2... buy it instead."
4,scooby doo and the ghoul school,i just want to say that i know that my daughter will like this. she's a big fan of scooby doo. and so am i. sorry that it took me so long to get back to u.
4,Great Movie,"I really enjoyed this movie, i am a huge scooby doo fan. Only thing i didnt like about this movie was that it had scrappy on it, Other than that is was great. It had a great plot and great characters. If you are a scooby fan you will love this movie!"
5,great,I loved this movie as a kid and had a hard time finding it for my kids. Its in great condition and they love it.
5,Awesome,"Awesome old cartoon classics. I totally loved it. Besides Scrappy which I always dislike, the cartoon is great. It's even better than some of the new ones. A must have for collection."
4,Class Is In Session.:),"Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School is a classic Hanna-Barbera animated movie that is perfect for kids and grown-ups. It features Scooby, Scrappy-Doo and Shaggy getting a job at a finishing school where the students are daughters of the world's famous monsters. The DVD also has special features like two Scooby-Dooo music videos and a trailer for the Scooby-Doo live-action movie."
1,I'm sick of this movie,"This movie might seem funny and amusing the first time you watch it. I am not a very big scooby doo fan, and I have to put up with my parents making me watch this movie with my sister in order to stop her tantrums about five times a week.The plot is extremely boring--you might expect more twists and originality in the plot in most scooby doo movies, and the characters were so.... I can't find a word to describe it.What I mean to say is, if you have younger siblings who are mad about scooby doo and 'trying' films that have originality whatsoever, this is not the video to get."
1,Boring and pointless,"My six-year-old son is a huge Scooby fan so I have seen a lot of these episodes and movies. He enjoys the ""old"" Scooby as well as the ""What's New Scooby Doo"" series, and I must say that I do too. That said, this awful movie was not just aimless and devoid of any of the usual fun and humor, it was downright painful to watch. This might have been more palatable as a single half-hour episode, but I doubt it. Twenty-five minutes into the movie, my husband asked me how much longer we had to subject ourselves to it. Forty-five minutes into this thing, my son muttered to himself ""I wonder when it going to get to the scary part!"" I don't think it ever quite got there. Avoid this movie like the plague, and go for something else. Even watching the better videos over and over ad nauseum would be better than viewing this again."
1,"horrible, stupid, annoying - avoid!",OMG - We love Scooby but it was painful to watch this bunch of crap.My three year old watched it and enjoyed it but I thought it was so bad I refused to let her watch it again. I got rid of it ASAP.
1,Where's the Gang?--Avoid this tape!,"Scooby, Scrappy, and Shaggy, appear but none of the others, nor the Mystery Machine. The jokes are TERRIBLE and the plot is disjointed and idiotic. The story is so bad it was hard to watch. See the other negative reviews and take heed.THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO CASH-IN ON THE POPULARITY OF SCOOBY DOO WITH A 1980's REHASH, LOW-QUALITY PRODUCTION."
1,!!SCRAPPY DOO!! WARNING-SCRAPPY DOO!!!!,"If they're going to have Scrappy Doo as a character in ANY of the digital offerings, that needs to be disclosed like potentially buying a home where a murder took place...even my 5-year-old loathed him very quickly. Really peeved I added this to the collection for the kids for $10 and found in in the first 2 mins that Scrappy was in there - now I must really research before screwing up on an impulse buy."
3,"4 year olds love it, parents will cry in pain","Wow... I have sat through this Scooby probably a hundred times... and I am now to the point that I want to set the DVD on fire.The good:- apparently it is very entertaining to 4 year oldsThe bad:- Only Scooby, Shaggy and Scrappy - I hate Scrappy- The monsters, though friendly, are real- The plot makes NO sense at all... something about Shaggy being a gym teacher for an all girls monster school and they are playing volleyball against some jerks from a military school. And then there is some witch trying to capture the kids- The voices of the Ghoul Girls are irritating beyond belief... specifically the little girl ghost that has the screeching laugh.- The mystery machine isn't even hereIn summary, your little ones will probably really like this movie, and you will probably want to be on the other side of the house while it is playing...Kids Rating - 4-5 out of 5 starsAdults Rating - 1-2 out of 5 stars"
1,Don't waste your money,"My kids are huge Scooby Doo fans. We own about 20 Scooby DVD's and this one is BY FAR the worst! Even my daughter thought it was awful and she never criticizes anything Scooby Doo.This movie is not your typical ""Mystery Inc solves another mystery"" movie. Only Scooby and Shaggy are in this one, and they are really more like the supporting cast. The main characters are the annoying teachers and students of the Ghoul School.Don't waste your time or money on this one. It's not worth it."
5,The Most Watched Scooby-Doo,"We have all of the Scooby-Doo video releases for our grandchildren. So far, this is their favorite. Both the three and five-year old choose this one first - especially over some of the ""spookier"" videos such as Zombie Island. Even though this movie does not include the Mystery, Inc. gang, the kids giggle and laugh and enjoy it very much."
4,Good Book,Keeps the story line of the series going. An easy and entertaining read. Would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the previous Shopaholic books.
3,"Ok, but storyline is the same","I love the Shopaholic series. However, the story lines seem to all be the same - Becky shops - a lot, Luke has issues at work that he does not share with her, she thinks he is cheating, Becky does something stupid and manages to turn it into something positive, etc.The book is funny and good for a quick read during spring break. I just wish we could see Becky get a real life and do something besides shop. Seriously, what person needs 5 prams?"
3,It starting to get a little old,"Becky Brandon is have baby! Time to go shopping for everything that a baby is going to need. Prams, cribs and everythin else a baby needs. Becky is have a great time shopping, then she hears that Venetia Carter is back in London. Becky just knows that having A-list doctor delivering her baby is just what she needs. But it turns out that the famous Dr. Carter has some history with her husband Luke. Now Becky is trying to save her job, her marriage, while trying to get ready for the next generation of shoppers.""Shopaholic and Baby"" is the fifth book in this series by Sophie Kinsella and while the beginning of the series was pretty good, I have admitt that I am getting a bit tired of it. Becky seem to be a character that just can't learn. Becky's attitude was fun in the beginning but its getting old."
3,Getting old,"The formula for these books is always the same. Becky gets in trouble due to her shopping addiction, unwittingly helps someone, and at the end saves the day. At first I thought her story and character was funny and cute, now she's just too darn annoying. I find that I'm disgusted through the majority of the book and it's very difficult to stay interested in a character that is just so unlovable. I think this will be the last Shopaholic book I read unless the author shakes it up a bit and strays from her normal formula."
2,Bleh,"I didn't like this book very much. It seemed to be the same as the other books and, in my opinion, very predictable. Becky is always getting herself into ridiculous situations and misunderstandings that nobody would ever get themselves into in real life. I suppose that's part of the charm to some people, but I found it very annoying this time."
5,Must Read!!!,"This book has to be the best out of her series, its witty and fun. It is a great summer read if your looking for something light and funny. The entire series was great and i'm really hoping that she doesn't stop at this one i would definetely read more of Becky's adventures. I admit i've been where she has and overindulged and looked at my Visa bill and nearly passed out the first time. I can competely relate to all her adventures especailly this one i was actually 3 months pregnant when i started reading this i admit it was kinda redundant in some parts but it was funny anyways. The villian Venetia Carter was just Hillarious!!! I think that this was the greatest thing about this book was it actually had a ""villian"". It was amazing and please please Sophie Kinsella WRITE MORE ABOUT Becky Bloomwood (Brandon)!! I will be sure to purchase and read it if you do."
3,Typical for the series,"I enjoyed the first few Shopaholic books. But this one I started to get a little annoyed with the main character. Hasn't she learned her lesson YET? How can anyone be that much of an idiot with money? Well, maybe there are people out there like that, sadly. Anyway, the book was entertaining at times. I am probably just tired of the series."
1,Hideous!,"I have directed my dear sister to never, ever use me again as guinea pig should she want a ""guy's reaction"" to a book. I can only hope that this expression of so-called chick-lit is not the standard by which most women are entertained. Ms. Kinsella has, as we say in pre-school sandlots, a bit of a potty-mouth, and has transformed this into a genre that I title as ""Wants to be cute so she swears."" OK, we get that you know all the FCC-forbidden words. We get that your characters think endlessly about consummation of, well, just about any enounter they encounter. My recommendation for Ms. Kinsella's penalty is that she must stay on a desert island for one full month (one of the longer months, like March), and then read and read Bronte and Austen (not re-read, as I am sure that writers like Ms. Kinsella have never read Bronte or Austen), and learn from them how to use prose to transform the reader. I even have a new crime of which I now accuse Ms. Kinsella: Prose Abuse."
4,Love/Hate Relationship,"I've finished the entire series and do think Sophie Kinsella did an overall good job. The books are fun to read. As I went through the series I got more and more annoyed with Becky. Her habit of telling lies to her husband (Brandon) was hard to read through at times & even the lie about going in labor. You'd think by the end of the series Becky would have learned something, but she doesn't. She's still the same Becky Bloomwood readers were introduced to in the 1st book (Confessions of a Shopaholic). The side stories (Suze,Jess, Janice, Tom, Mum & Dad) are what makes this book cute and fun to read. Good book but don't expect anything new from Becky."
4,Same Becky as ever,"If you have enjoyed the Shopaholic series in the past then you will enjoy this too. I found this particular adventure of Becky's even more fanciful than they others.In this book,as the title probably gives away, Becky is pregnant with her first baby. She has her same wacky adventures mostly related to Pram shopping but she is dealing with a potentially cheating husband.The caricature of her conniving OB and her husband are kind of over the top and Kinsella works so hard to sell the cheating senario that as she wraps up the book a lot of the pieces don't fit together.I also wasn't totally on board with Becky's pregnancy experience, having had two kids myself it didn't feel very realistic to me.Having said that, I gave the book 4 stars because it is just plain fun to read. So bottom line, if you are a shopaholic fan, you will enjoy this too, just don't wait for it to get the pulitzer."
5,welcome addition to the series,"This is a very well written addition to the Shopaholic Series. Just like the other ones this book makes me laugh and laugh and laugh till I have to put down the book. The way Sophie Kinsella writes about Becky's life, now expecting, is just so charming and amusing that I can't wait to have a baby just so I can go shopping as well :-)There is a huge downfall in the book involving her husband Luke that I think could have been kept a littler shorter...but in the end all will be well!Can't wait for the next book in this series...wonder what it will be... Shopaholic & Pregnant again cause shopping was so much fun the first time around..."
3,Shopaholic & Baby (Shopaholic),I was so excited when this book came out because I love the Shopaholic! I was a little disapointed because it was so predictable. I feel like the author wrote it to make the readers happy not because she still loved her character. By the way Luke Brandon is really a jerk not the loving husband Becky thinks that he is.
2,"It was good while it lasted, but the series has run its course.","I've been a huge fan of the series since my first laugh out loud reading ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"". Each subsequent edition has been slightly more watered-down and ludicrous, but Shopaholic & Baby conjures up eye rolls and groans rather than giggles and guffaws. I think it's time for Becky to hang it up."
4,Cute,"For some reason, I couldn't get into this book like I had with the previous 4 in the series. Once I finally did, I devoured the rest of it. This one is probably the most ""dramatic"" of the series, but still light and fun. Becky learns important lessons with each book, yet she's always the same old Becky - and that's why we love her. Now that I'm back on the Becky Brandon (nee Bloomwood) wagon, I can't wait to read Mini Shopaholic!"
2,FEELING SORRY FOR BECKY'S KID,"This wasn't very good. I struggled to finish it. Becky proves in this book that she just isn't mature enough to be a mother. The name she gave her baby girl is beyond dreadful! This unbelievably cold, red haired witch is trying to steal her husband off her,worse of all the red haired witch is her obyn doctor. Becky really thinks Luke is leaving her and it really messes with her head.The other books in the series are spot on. Also ,I liked that they brought Jess,her level headed sister back as a character and gave her a love interest.It was nice to see Danny her friend from New York pop in and out of this book, but other than that this book was pretty lame."
5,Another great book!,"I'm a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella's books, especially her Shopaholic series.I wasn't the least bit disappointed in this new addition and I cannot wait for another book to be released! I'd alos love to see another series started. That would be fab ;)!"
1,No more sopholic books! (spoilers within),"Sopholoic and Baby starts out with Becky discovering she is pregnant with her and Luke's first child. However, one of Luke's former girlfriends is the premier obstrecian in London right now (of course) and Becky wants her baby to be delivered by her. Soon Becky starts to believe that Luke and his former girlfriend are having an affair and that he no longer loves her.Of course the same things that have happened in the previous four novels occurs here. Becky and Luke have huge misunderstandings, Becky spends too much money on baby things, Becky is being self-absored. The book had the worst ending ever with Luke somehow losing his company and Becky having made millions of dollars through some hare brained scheme.I struggled to finish this novel and ended up donating it to my local library."
2,seriously?,"I guess everyone found this book funny except me. Just as in the previous 2 in the series, I wanted to punch Becky for being such a stupid, selfish cow rather than cheer for her. I bought the book b/c of the good reviews here. I have read the original Shopaholic at least 5 times and adored it for its humor and page turning laughs. 'Shopaholic Takes Manhattan' continued the storyline nicely...but the laughs end when it's the same recycled plot and the protagonist never--ever--grows up. It's not ""cute"" that a woman in her *late 20's* (does anyone else realize this?) still giggles, LIES, and shops her way out of everyday situations. Where I used to love Becky, I now loathe her. Between the last 2 books I wonder why Luke would stay married to such a braindead bimbo. Yes, these books are an escape from reality, but there's also something called an insult to a reader's intelligence, and this series has definitely crossed that line."
2,Characters not 'lovable' enough for me,"Although she is witty and sometimes funny, I found it hard to care about what happened to Becky Bloomwood. Her irresponsibility really bothered me and Luke didn't seem like that much of a catch. I like happy ending stories but was still disappointed in the overall story in the end. I most likely will not read any more of the series. The only thing I found amusing were her analogies of shopping/fashion to everything else in life."
4,More of the same--but a fun read,"By now, Becky is well known to anyone who has read the series. This book isn't any different than the others--but it's a great, easy weekend read."
4,Very entertaining but.....,I could have done without the explanations of things that had happened in previous books. All that rehashing was like speed bumps and I don't think that it was necessary. When writing a series the author should either assume that the reader has read the previous books or hope that they'll be curious enough to want to go back and read them.It does loyal readers of the series a disservice to subject them to those kinds of interruptions.
5,LOVED IT,Sophie Kinsella is simply the best. I've read all of her books and this one really tops it for me. I cried and laughed so hard at this book. She really knows how to draw me into the story. Becky Bloomwood (the main character) is truely the best. I loved loved loved it.
5,The best one yet!,"I love the Shopaholic books, but everyone I have read so far I get very annoyed with Becky and her crazy ways. But not this time, not with this book. I could not put it down! Becky is becoming such a great character I just loved this book and just hope that there are more Shopaholics to come. This book throws a lot of curve balls but it is a MUST read!"
3,A little disappointing..,"At the recommendation of a friend, I started reading the Shopaholic series last summer. Becky Bloomwood wormed her way into my heart, Denny & George scarf and all. Now we're 5 books in, and quite frankly, I don't find her all that endearing anymore. Her eccentric quirks and her apparent lack of common sense become increasingly frustrating throughout this book. I spent the majority of my time skimming through the pages, wishing that somehow, some way, Becky would not only learn the value of a dollar (it must be nice to have a rich husband to bail you out every time you screw up! And I've never heard of banks permitting overdrafts of $3000 - mine starts charging insane fees if you go even a penny in the red!), but to learn from her mistakes, which she is apparently incapable of doing.I don't know that I will be continuing on with this series, which is sad. I'd love to see Becky embrace her Shopaholic nature, while at the same time, being a smart shopper. It can be done."
5,Great Beach Read,"""At last, another saga in the on-going life of loveable spendaholic Becky Bloomwood - this time featuring Becky as a mother."""
1,Absolutely dreadful,"While attempting to read this book, I could not stop my gag reflex from releasing vomit into my throat. I have never in my life tried to read such a dreadful, plotless piece of tripe before. I slightly enjoyed Can You Keep a Secret? and was looking for another light read. This was so light it floated away on a sea of disgust. The book is 99% dialogue, i.e. there is no plot. The main character is heinously insipid. I refused to donate this book to be sold as used to prevent someone else from having to waste their time with this horrid book."
5,Couldn't stop laughing,This was the funniest Shopaholic book yet. I couldn't stop laughing at Becky's antics. Enjoy!
4,This can't be the last in the series...,"This book deals mostly with Becky's pregnancy and the shennanigans that ensue when she overshops, and signs on with an ob-gyn whom she finds out is Luke's ex-girlfriend. I was curious to see how a self-centered, feckless character like Becky would deal with the all-consuming state of new motherhood. I hope there's at least one more book in the series that shows Becky dealing with the trials and tribulations Mom's everywhere go through, and maybe FINALLY growing up (I hope she still retains her love of shopping, though...).It's a good read due to the humor and Kinsella's knack with dialogue, just not quite what I expected."
4,You Have to Love It,"This isn't my favorite book in the series, but it's still excellent. Kinsella is still hilarious and Becky is still loveable. I really hope the series doesn't end here! Becky with a toddler and looking for pre-schools would be hilarious...It's good light fun and the perfect book to relax with :)"
4,Fabulous read!,This is the latest in Kinsella's Shopaholic series. I'm a huge fan of the books and am looking forward to the film in the making. Becky is likeably crazy and manages to get in to some twisted situations. Humor and laugh out loud scenes are abundant!
5,Well worth the read!,"I have read all of the previous four Shopaholic books and this one is one of my favorites. I thought that Shopaholic and Sister was rather slow, but this one was very easy to read. I thought it was so well written that I was getting angry about things that Becky was angry about! I recommend this to all Shopaholic fans. If you have not yet read the first books in the series, I highly recommend it."
3,Same plot,"I have to agree with other reviewers that this book has the same plot line as all the others. It is fun, light, reading but I couldn't help but wonder why her husband Luke would stay with her. I would like to see a little more depth to this character. I got the feeling she was even looking at the baby as just another accessory. It is fun reading but nothing I would cancel plans to go out and buy. Wait for the paperback version or get a used copy on Amazon."
4,Good reference.,"This is a good reference for scientific writing and a must for aspiring, new scientists trying to publishing in ACS journals. This book can be picked up for less than 5 bucks and is well worth the price."
3,Very expensive for what you get,"I had to buy this book for my Writing for Chemists in college. It was very expensive when I bought it. I only used it once. The book is not very well organized, and it is difficult to find what you need. I think it is not a good book!"
4,"Amazing music, good performers","I bought this album more based on curiosity than on a specific knowledge about the ""Orfeo"" and about this CD. The music is among the best I have listened in my life and the singers are very good. Just one not so small missing detail: this edition is missing the booklet with the Orfeo text; even if it's very easy to understand many of the words I will like to have it."
3,Melville's first hit,"I read this book to get a better sense of Melville's abilities and his style. Having read Moby Dick, I was prepared for a complicated and somewhat dissolute read with great symbolism. Typee is none of that, though it has elements of the style that would, through Moby Dick make Melville post-humously famous. Written today, this book would not be a hit, though one can see why it was when it was published in the 1800s. The symbolism in Typee is not as substantive or immediately obvious as in MD, but it is present and gives this work more depth than is at first apparent. I don't know that I have an accurate sense of what Melville is all about after reading this and MD, and I would probably recommend one read Billy Budd or at least another novel in order to really get a feel for Melville."
3,Narrative account,"Typee is a narrative account of the three months that Herman Melville spent among the Typee tribe after deserting from a whaling ship. It goes into minute details about the everyday life of the Typee. At times I felt a bit glassy eyed and skimmed forward over some sections.Melville comes across a bit dense and self centered, and obviously applied a double standard, one for whites and one for natives. After toying with the affections of a young native woman, he casually abandons her and does not seem to understand why her family would object. Perhaps he would have had a better understanding if he was abandoning the daughter of a prominant politician in New England.He was somewhat a nosy Parker, inserting himself in situations where he was not wanted, and showing little regard for the customs of the Typee. Overall, it is an interesting account of life among the natives."
4,An Old Classic,"This is a true classic and should be required reading at some point in one's life.Melville lived with alleged cannibals, but they harmed him not. The Marquesas shouldbe on the adventurer's modern bucket list."
2,Disappointing,"Three stories -- one good, one thin but decent, and a third just hack writing in the thriller style. The good part of this novel is about the failed Franklin expedition -- interesting history, well-rendered, good focus on the boy, Gus and the second in command, Crozier. The decent story is of a polar bear, also well-researched and captivating. Tied to these two is the modern day story about the explorer and the journalist. The author creates stereotypes instead of real people. The story of the child is nothing but a tear jerker. The behavior of the half-brother, John, is extreme and unbelievable. And the idea that an intelligent and drop-dead beautiful woman like Catherine would fall for the warped John is absurd. Other than that, it's a decent read."
4,Summer Vacation Novel,I got this book at a book exchange grocery store in Arkansas. I enjoyed reading it and am with many of the other reviewers who had never heard of the Franklin expedition to find the Northwest Passage. The mix of present day with past and the incidental story of the polar bear kept the book fresh and one could never declare they were bored while reading it. I came away feeling the book would make a great movie and with an insatiable curiosity about this expedition. I loved and appreciated the authors footnote at the end of the story. I gave my book exchange book to my friends in Arkansas to read and now must get another one for my Northern Wisconsin friends.
3,Some Cold Comfort for Summer,"Elizabeth McGregor's The Ice Child is not an entirely satisfying read. It tells the story of the Franklin expedition, from the useful device of a fictonal boy on board who grows into a man during the disastrous trip, and the it is also the story of people obesses with the Franklin expedition, including two half-brothers, both in danger of never growing up in their very different ways, one physically and one emotionally, and the women who connect them both. The book does have an emotional impact but the writing, at times, lets the story down. Some of the characters, particulary the grown son and his mother (the truly evil and selfish first wife) seem half drawn. The Franklin expedition sequences are quite exciting and the author keeps both stories moving swiftly and effectively along. For many, this book will prove a cool read in the summer sun. For me, the entire book did not live up to the promise of the best parts of the novel."
4,Intriguing,"This book was a different kind of story. It kept my interest. The two different stories, one a historical fiction and one a novel, both came together in the end."
4,"A NICE, FUN READ","PICKED UP THIS BOOK--JUDGING BY THE COVER---I FIND A LOT OF GOOD BOOKS THAT WAY.I THOUGHT THAT THIS BOOK WAS VERY, VERY EASY TO READ---WAS NOT A LABOR.THE WRITING STYLE BY THE AUTHOR IS WHAT DOES THIS JOB.THREE STORIES--MELDED TOGETHER---VERY INTERESTING.AS STORIES THAT SKIP AROUND---I FOUND THIS ONE VERY EASY TO FOLLOW---GOOD JOB!!"
3,"Extemely well researched, making for a very interesting read","Only three stars because there are 3 stories here, but the ""main"" one isn't as good as the others. I enjoyed it enought to stay with it until the end. Guys will really enjoy the jump back in time (Mid-1800's) to the story of a very young man sailing away to the north Atlantic on a journey expected to take 2-3 years. That was fascinating."
2,use and abuse of a title...,"I believe that Gray's book developped a very interesting concept and I believe that it is not very intelligent to use as subtitle the same idea in another book. However, Van Horn develops his own ideas which are interestings but not new at all. He also express his own personal religious beliefs that not everybody would agree with..."
4,Johnny Dilks,"This is definitely real country and sounds like it could have come from the 40's and 50's. It is the kind of country music that I can understand if a person doesn't like, but for me I love stuff like this. My two favorite songs are ""One Foot In The Grave"" and ""Mama I'm Coming Home"". If you like Hank Sr's music then there is a really good chance you will enjoy this."
4,It's growing on me...,"I wasn't wild about this album the first time I listened to it, mostly being put off by Johnny's nasal voice. But lately it's been getting a lot more play time on my car stereo (usually back to back with Hank Williams' Greatest Hits, an excellent compliment to this album). The music is a great send-back to the country styles prevalent in the early 50's: western swing, honky-tonk sendups, and close harmony. I enjoy the faster - paced numbers more than the ballads, but there's not a track on here I haven't caught myself singing along with lately."
2,If you dont mind whiny-trying-really-hard-for-that-drawl..,"...singing, then this CD is for you! the music is great, and after skipping through a few songs, i was almost wishing that it was all instrumentals. dilks' voice is just too thin and whiney to really make this cd stand out. apart from that, the band really does a great job and the playing is top notch... sadly enough, that wasn't enough to make me *not* return the cd..."
4,"cute, cuddly, and so much more!","my daughter found out about this group from her friend and she thought they were so cute. then she heard their high voices and fun lyircs and she fell in love with them.they're 4 little hampsters that sing songs like ""dance to the music"". they are really fun for young kids because of the simple lyrics and catchy tune."
5,Must see,"Reality is hard for some to deal with but people need to know what is going on. And if you don't believe what you see in the movie read up on it on your own and look at the quotes, and watch the speeches of the Iranian leaders.Remember this is not an indictment of the majority of Iranian people, who yearn for freedom, but of the extreme fundamentalists who run their government and the brain washed robots who support them.Also please note that the 5 negative reviews on this site were posted either by a group of friends, or the same two people under different names. They most likely have not seen the movie. Clearly they are giving the movie a poor review as revenge for what they perceive as US support for Saddam Hussein during the Iraq-Iran war. Amazon really needs to find a way to weed out these shills."
2,"""Loose Tea"" not ""Loose Leaf Tea""","I love Twining's Irish Breakfast tea- Before I started using a real tea pot with loose leaf teas, I would have it every morning with breakfast. So, when I got into loose leaf teas, I naturally ordered my favorite tea.This is actually just little pellets of tea with no leaves at all.I didn't notice that missing word in the description when I ordered it, and I was quite disappointed to find that this teas falls through the strainer in my tea pot.Very disappointing."
5,Love this tea!,This is a pretty robust blend and is my everyday morning tea. I like it with a spot of honey.
2,Expected Better,"I love Twinings Irish Breakfast teabags, but wanted to try the loose leaf tea to use in my new teapot. I was very disappointed when I received it to find that the loose tea looked like instant coffee & a lot of the tea leaves ended up in my cup. My teapot has small slits in the infuser but the tea was so fine that it washed out into the teapot. I was expecting better from Twinings."
2,"Weaker than teabag version, faulty Amazon advertising","Twinings teabag Irish Breakfast Tea has four tea leaf rating while the English Breakfast Tea has three tea leaf strength rating, illustrated on the box. The images of Twinings tea tins do not possess the strength rating, however, when I received my tins they both had three tea leaf strengths on the front of the tin. I cannot explain the disparity in strength rating between teabag and tin for the Irish Breakfast tea.My reason for buying Irish Breakfast tea was for my first cup of tea, higher strength than their English Breakfast tea. Amazon should correct this by getting Twinings to send updated images. Similarly, written descriptions fail to indicate Twinings tea strengths using Twinings tea leaf rating system. This should also be corrected. My supplier's and Amazon's processing were both superlative."
4,Better than I expected,"I bought a Schecter Omen extreme 6 from American Musical Supply here on Amazon.com for 299$. I was looking for a decent sounding starter guitar, as I just picked up the instrument a few months ago. I have had musician friends, so I know what good and bad guitars sound like. It surpassed my expectations. This guitar has the sound of a 600$ guitar for around 300$. It doesn't even have active pickups, so I'm not even sure how it's possible. What more could you ask for? Not to mention, the thing is a tank. I hit it against a wall by accident. There is a huge chunk out of the wall, but my guitar is still flawless. Paint from the wall didn't even rub off on it. Buy this guitar. You will not regret it."
1,No update in years! Really needs an overhaul!,"Great product but it is not keeping up with its own promises. No dictionary updates in years, software is clunky and needs many improvements. I feel like the developers have already jumped ship years ago and are no longer interested in what they have sold. It is not a cheap program and once you have 100s of songs in their database you are kind of stuck. Beware!!!"
3,Decent Program but there are tech issues,"My songwriting partner and I have been using Masterwriter for over a year now and like it for its features and its ability for us to send updated songs back and forth via email using the import / export features. My biggest complaint is their authorization system. So far 3 or 4 times now our computers have ""lost"" their ""activation"" either just by going through Masterwriter's own update prompts or, worse yet, for no apparent reason at all. It apparently loses track of whatever system, or kernel of information they use to recognize your computer. Going through their re-activation prompts just leads to a frustrating ""catch-22"" game and we ,once again, go crawling back to tech support begging them to release the old activation numbers and issue new ones."
5,Looks great,"I love this cover so far. It looks wonderful and slides on my Cleveland blade putter with ease. It is actually just a tad big, but doesn't seem to fall off. Fast shipping from Amazon also. Received the item at an APO address in Korea in just 6 days."
3,Hmmm....,I mean I like Chris and Cosey but time has not been very gentle on this brand of techno. It has aged quite a bit and does not seem that experimental anymore.
2,Was not what I wanted.,It is a beautiful book for Patio's and Porch's but was lacking in yard landscaping.
5,Best book from my favorite author--SUPERB!,"Wesley has done it again! I have read a number of her works, and this is the best yet. Her writing style is very fluent, yet thoughtful as well. Sometimes her books are so steamy that it is impossible to put them down (and this is no exception). I strongly feel everyone should give any of Wesley's novels a try-- YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED. Other works of note from Mary Wesley are ""The Camomile Lawn"" and ""A Sensible Life"" to name a couple (there are several others, all superb)"
1,disappointed,"Ordered this book thinking that the positive review on amazon was a good recommendation, wrong! The book is a photo copied version of an old text, and the copier evidently left out the last couple of pages, which I felt were very important to the book. Also, the price reflects a price that would indicate it is more valuable, but in fact to me was much over-rated and over priced. Don't buy this book!"
5,Basis of lectures to school children on escape from Denmark,I buy this book for my good friend who escaped from Denmark during the War. He is Jewish and gives lectures to small school children and groups on the flee of Jewish Danish citizens from Germans. He loves this book.
3,A Night of Watching,"This a simply a GOOD STORY. It is not a great book, but it tells an important story with care and precision. Barry"
3,"Complete but shallow, somewhat outdated.","Introduced to the fun of writing in 2006 by Chris Baty's NaNoWriMo challenge, I met his challenge and commenced searching for information about not only editing, but selling my work. I bought Ms. Sander's CIGSP as a step toward my goal of making money from my writing efforts.I found CIGSP to cover the entire field of self-publishing, but weak in coverage of the details. Amazon's new CreateSpace hands the writer a powerful augmentation of POD, relieving the author of many publishing chores, freeing him up to focus on marketing his product. Amazon itself provides many ways to do this if one spends enough time educating oneself on their tools available."
3,Nah! I'd Say PASS on This Book!,"I guess I expected so much more. It went on and on about getting the book to look a certain way but hardly any content on marketing and distribution (which are MOST important).The best book I ever got about self-publishing was FREE from Infinity Publishing who prints self-published titles (infinitypublishing.com). I have every self-published how-to book out there and this one, by far, has been the most informative, step-by-step, comprehensive, and simple book on this topic I've ever read."
2,"Too much fluff, not enough real info","This book was disappointing for several reasons.Not enough real info as far as how to go about getting a book out there to sell, unless you're doing a stapled or comb-bound type of book you can have printed at just about any local copy shop.No discussion about why you would want to trademark a title (she says she'll discuss it, but never does).Endless mentions throughout the book of the author's other books, which, with the one exception of the first one she actually sold herself, add nothing to the education of the reader as far as self-publishing goes.Too much time/paper spent on the pros/cons of self-publishing, instead of info on how to go about doing it.There is a little useful information in this book, but borrow from the library first, before buying."
3,"OK, but expected more",This book gave an adequate treatment of self-publishing but I expected more of the nitty-gritty coverage on the topic of preparing your book for publication. For those who are interested in the steps to self-publishing their book starting with a blank sheet of paper I invite them to read my recently published book (February 2011)Self-Publishing Your Book--A Nuts And Bolts Approach
1,expensive poor quality product,Better products available. This is nothing more than a big plastic bottle full of water.
2,Very disappointing but may help women with flat figures,"After reading the customer reviews, I purchased this book. I was extremely disappointed, as the authors address only basic fitting for slight adjustments in flat patterns, which are not usually helpful for adjusting to persons with real shape problems and especially not helpful for those with a very large bust. Also, the book does not address the many small adjustments that are necessary for a really great fit. I would suggest it only to those who are able to use commercial flat (vs multi-seamed and contoured)patterns and need only small adjustments."
1,Title is Misleading,"It does show how to alter patterns using the cut, pivot, slide methods. However, it doesn't show what bad fit looks like and then link that to the pattern alteration needed. If you need to see what needs to happen if, for example, your side seams swing forward, your neck gapes, your pants have smiles or frowns... then this book isn't for you. I'm returning it at my expense."
3,ok,"Just recieved this jungle hat. It was less than I expected. I have another by a different brand that is much better. This one is stiff and feels cheap. I got an XL and it feels tight. My other XL is comfortable. It may loosen up with time. It will serve the purpose. Will proably be better when broken in. Three stars because there is nothing really wrong with it, and it did cost less."
4,Boonie hat,"You get what you pay for and this hat applies. I would point out that for the price, the value of this hat is good. While I would say it is a bit flimsy and cheaply put together, it certainly will work for a simple cheap boonie hat. I have the Under Armour version of a boonie and there is no denying that there is no comparison, the UA hat kills it. The UA hat is more than twice the price of this hat, so this is to be no surprise. All in all I am happy with the purchase."
2,Yuck,"This hat is of very poor quality. Bad crafting and materials. Look elsewhere, as this is not worth the cost."
4,Interesting take on these works,"Two big works for violin and piano performed by two very capable Frenchmen. The pianist here, Georges Pludermacher, is simply outstanding with coloration and control. For my ears the violin sound was a bit thin and sometimes the tempi in the Strauss slowed down to almost a halt for no apparent reason...which interrupts the flow. Still, a well done performance overall. Worth a listen, though."
4,Good Read,This book was another I had figured out what was happening. Maybe after reading so many Agatha Christie books I am finally getting to know her way of thinking. It was a very good read and kept me interested to the very end. I recommend this book.
4,Good Book,"This books was a great book. Not one of her bests but still great. It was a little slow in the beginning. The murderer I never would have guessed (like most of her books.) I read The Murder of Roger Ackroyd this year in 6th grade, and loved it. She got me hooked. Like I said, great but not one of her bests."
3,MEDIOCRE,"While not a complete waste, this isn't the best of her novels. However, you won't be disappointed with the usual mind-blowing ending....you'll never guess it!"
3,The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side,"This novel features Miss Marple in her very late years. The world around her is changing. This is one of only two Christie novels where I was able to guess the identity of the murderer. It's a very good murder mystery, but it could have been a better Miss Marple mystery. The best parts of the book are when Miss Marple is on the spot. Unfortunately, I almost began to wonder if Miss Marple would be in this novel at all. She left her house no more than three times and was therefore decidedly shoved into the background. The parts without her were rather dull, dry, and far too abundant. I found myself rushing more to see if I'd solved the mystery correctly rather than out of any sense of real enjoyment."
2,The Mirror Crack'd: From Side to Side,"Very difficult Audio CD to listen to. Reader has very strong accent and a lot of the words seem slurred/mumbled, voice dips low. Very hard to understand. I am quite disappointed."
3,"Too Obvious, Lots of Loose Ends","This isn't Christie at her best. The solution was too obvious (I knew it pretty much instantly, although that could be just me) and there are too many red herrings thrown around. During the book you get more and more sensational revelations, but they are never really cleared up (not that they matter...). The end feels rushed. A lot of stuff happens and then it's suddenly over."
5,Great book for kids and adults alike!,This book is not your average fairy tale! It shows you the true side of modeling and what it takes to get here. This is a great read and will keep you in suspense until the very end!
5,"""But Water is Always Best When You Share it With Your Friends!""","""Bear Loves Water"" is a chubby ""Bear in the Big Blue House"" board-book. In this book, Bear talks about all of the things he loves about water. He loves splashing in puddles, taking a bath, drinking it and playing in fluffy snow. He concludes, though, that his favorite thing about it is sharing it with friends.This is a Super Chubby ""board-book,"" perfect for the youngest readers. This is yet another those books that could probably go in the bath and not suffer any damage. The story is just right for the youngest Bear readers or for any fan of the show."
1,Hope Floats,"I have always loved this movie. I also like to be able to hear the movie as I view it. The sound quality on this film is terrible. I can barely hear it, and I have good hearing.I lost the box so I couldn't return the film.Just not fair, terribly disappointed."
2,"Predictable Movie, with an Annoying Kid on Top","This was not an impressive movie. The plot was too predictable, and the little girl was so bratty, it was hard to watch. I expected more from a Sandra Bullock movie."
4,"Good, but cheesy","""Hope Floats"" is a typical family drama. A young woman, played by Sandra Bullock, finds out that her husband is in love with her best friend...on a nationwide TV show. As a result, takes her daughter and moves back to her hometown, a small place in Texas, called Smithville. Living at her mother's house, she soon loses her nerves. Right at this moment, the attractive cowboy Justin comes along to win her heart.What can I say about this movie? It's definitely entertaining and very well acted. Especially Gena Rowlands (as mother) and Mae Whitman (as daughter) are over the top.But somehow something is missing in ""Hope Floats""...maybe it's just a bit too American for the taste of an average European.Nevertheless...if you like this kind of movies, you should take a look at it. It's no mistake."
2,Depressing,This movie was just a little too slow and a little too depressing. I expected much more from the two stars.
5,"great plot and realistic too ,also just a very nice movie","great job!well done ,very good plot.these two make a great duo,hope tosee them together in more movies andtv.specials. Harry & Sandra ,I LOVEyou both!!! harry your music is great!! hope to hear u sing in the next one ,keep up the good work and that wonderful jazz of yours."
3,"The two things that held, and hold this movie down greatness","This is a good movie. As a guy it takes alot to say that about a romance movie, but it could be better. The first thing is to get rid of the bratty kid who doesn't know what she has in a wonderful mom played by Sandara Bullock, but I guess that's because she's a kid who is an exception where most accept divorce as a way of life she's holding the mother accountable for the breakdown of the marriage, but she comes to her senses at the end when she sees the father is apologizing for nothing. It's her crying at the end that is fraying on the nerves though. The other thing is the fact that they omitted Live's ""Lightning Crashes"" from the movie soundtrack, and the movie itself. It's done in the preview, so why keep it out of the movie? As I said it's a good movie, but it could've been better."
2,Sandra Bullock: Milk Toast Acting/Script,"How this movie has so many stars is beyond me. In brief: a woman who is jilted by her husband returns home to Texas with her daughter. She's reunited with a classmate who had a crush on her in high school(and still does). The rest of the movie follows them spending time together, her being tentative about a new relationship, and a gratuitously goofy scene meant to tug at your heartstrings with the cast lip-syncing; it's just far too obvious. The best part of this movie revolves around the daughter; she's bullied in school, missing her father and actually makes us feel her emotional pain. If you're looking for ""The Notebook"" or ""Sweet Home Alabama"" you've come to the wrong, watered-down place."
2,Not Enjoyable,"I loved Sandra Bullock's performance in ""While you were sleeping"", so I desided to purchase some of her other films to see if I could find another treasure. This wasn't it. Whoever described this movie as a feel good movie uses a different definition. It had a good ending, but most of the rest of the fild was rather depressing. Sandra's performance was OK, but not good strong to recover from a poor script."
5,A Glimpse into Real Life,"In the movie, Hope Floats, Sandra Bullock portrays a young woman who has never strived to be anything more than the prom queen she was in high school. When her husband leaves her for her best friend, she must face some hard truths about herself and her life. I hated this movie the first time I saw it, I didn't see any hope floating around anywhere. The 2nd time I saw it, I loved it and have seen it probably 15 times since then. If you didn't fall in love with it the first viewing, I recommend watching it one more time. Did the trick for me! Sandra Bullock was great and Harry Connick Jr. was certainly easy to watch with his cowboy hat and down-home small-town lifestyle."
4,One of the best films of 1998.,"Not without flaws, this little gem from the summer of 1998 inspired me to keep going no matter what, as I was about to make a nearly 400 mile trek to my college in Alabama. Bullock gives one of the best performances of her bolstering career as a woman whose husband proves to be anything but faithful. She and her young daughter head home to Texas where her mother lives, hoping to start over. At times this film touched home and made me think about my future and family. However, the script could use some polishing, as we wonder why Travis wears those cute costumes, what happens to Birdie's father after the funeral, and some things just looked out of place, but these little errs are easily overlooked and overshadowed by the film's dramatic emotional impact. Caleb Deschanel's photography never looked more natural or gorgeous, as it conveys the message of light and hope in times of dark peril and despair."
4,Romance in the old way,I was astonished to see that I reflected so much on this movie. It is very romantic and very well played. It was wonderful to see Gena Rowlands again acting as good as she always has done. But the great surprise for me was Sandra Bullock. She is certainly a girl with great classical style. I plan to see all her coming movies. The chemistry between her and Connick was very thrilling and I saw these scenes over and over again. The great disappointment was the very oldfashioned look at the role of a woman today. If Bullock didn't change after the end of the movie's story she would fall into the same type of problems as she had with Bill. I couldn't believe that a smart girl like Bullock didn't have any education. But I 50+ live in Europe. To-night I will enjoy Stolen hearts with Bullock.Anna Anna Gothenburg Sweden
4,"Indeed, Hope does Float","Having had a loss of my closest and dearest through cancer, this movie really touched me, even to the point of tears. But it was well acted, and the story was good"
1,Blah,"Horrible! Absolutly horrible! The whiny, insufferably annoying little girl in this wretched film is enough make a strong argument for birth control."
4,Hope Floats,"I have to tell you that I'm not pleased---I have ordered this DvD twice now and I still haven't received it, I'm always notified that there will be a delay, although when placing the order it's always ready to ship! The first time I ordered it I got so fed up with waiting that I canceled it, and this time It was ordered Jan. 6 and l have not received it. If you can't ship it, please notify your customers instead of spreading the ship date out. Lorelei Hauer 530-241-7446 mousekavitz@yahoo.com"
1,The worst movie that we've seen!,"This movie is absolutely awful. Just meanders and mopes along. No plot, no suspense. Do not waste your time seeing this movie. Harry Connick comes across as a stalker."
1,"Harry Connick Good, everything else is stale","Maybe call it Sandra Bullock burn-out, but I'm starting to find her annoying. Perhaps the script or directing was to blame. For whatever reasons, the movie ends up a flop.The initial ""hook"" -- cheating husband revealed on TV -- was clever enough, and the trip home to an oddball mom starts out kinda interesting. But from there, it's as if the writers/directors quit, and they just went through the motions for the rest of the movie. A lot of wasted potential.Harry Connick is good, but again seemed hamstrung by either the script or directing.Overall, mediocre fare."
4,Real Life Drama,"Birdie Pruitt(Sandra Bullock)is shocked out of her complacency with the, so called, perfect life when her husband admits, on a public television talk show, that he has been unfaithful. Totally devastated, she and her daughter pack up and leave to go to her hometown, a small town that she thought that she had left behind. As they attempt to adjust to their new lives, Birdie slowly gains the strength to allow someone else into her heart and she once again regains the hope of a perfect life. You cannot but help to see the change in Birdie as she considers achieving this goal with a whole new perspective."
3,Realistic 90's Movie A Great Love Story,"For the people who didn't like the movie or the performance of the actors you're nuts not us. It was a down to earth, simple movie. We don't always need A lot of action and sex. I thought it was a great performance by both actors."
4,"Really realistic, if you grew up in a small Texas town.","What I liked best was the setting. Could say there is some bias. Filmed in my home town, Sandra and Harry acted right at home and fit right in during the filming. The story line touched on many of the small town themes personally observed over the years...from football hero marrying cheerleader queen, to the big divorce, to many who came home for help in raising small children, to finding there is lots of happiness in life even when we don't live up to our own expectations. If you grew up and love a small town anywhere, Hope Floats may make you homesick."
1,Could have been better story.,A thin plot that dragged on without any redemption in the end. Bought it for my wife as a stocking stuffer on christmas. Would have been easy to find a much better movie. If you were entertained by this then you obviously are easily entertained. Not one of Sandra Bullocks better movies. The effort was a waste of her talents.
1,Can we go lower than 1 star?,"I waited and waited for this movie to come out on video because I had missed it in theaters. It was a HUGE waste of my time. Sandra Bullock STUNK in this movie. Normally she's great. The soundtrack stinks and I think adults didn't even like it, I know most teenagers didn't. We all thought this was going to be a romantic love story, not about a guy being totally boring the whole movie while trying to win some girls heart. This was a total waste of time and it took way too long to get the story down. I mean the first time she actually considers going out with him, it's been an hour. Most people turned it off because it takes her 55 minutes just to realize she loves him. Then they waste more time on this and that. This movie gets half a star and if they had it, that's what I would put. I don't recomend this movie at all. The people who gave it 5 stars are nuts."
1,I wanted to like this movie,"I like Sandra Bullock and Harry Connick, Jr. I think they are decent actors. Notwithstanding these two facts, I despised this movie and thought it degraded both of them to be in it. The premise was interesting, but the execution was shallow, incomplete and painfully devoid of purpose."
4,True Texas,"I usually hate movies about Texas because they always portray as a bunch of hicks and we're not. I commend this movie (cause both Sandra and Harry are Texans) for FINALLY portraying Texas as it truly is. It's about damn time. I think Harry and Sandra work amazingly well together in this movie and that shows. The movie teaches society a lot in 2 short hours, none of which I'm gonna go into but you'll just have to see it to believe it. Twinkles."
2,Perfectly mediocre.,"This is just O.K. The story is old and there are no new twists to make it unique. Bullock hits some pretty clunky notes, but has some nice moments, too. The real acting here is done by Gena Rowlands. I recommend renting ""Gloria,"" for which she was nominated for an Academy Award several years ago. Connick is easy on the eyes, and the soundtrack is pretty good, but this is just a ""there"" movie. Not too good, not too bad, just ""there."""
1,Never Delivered as stated in tracking,Never Delivered as stated in the tracking. This is not the first time either. I wonder what the problem is.
4,good movie,"bought this film for my wife, she loves the story line as well as the actors. This is a romantic comedy every one can enjoy."
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!,"I know it seems like this movie can be cheesy at times but Sandra Bullock and Harry Connick, Jr. just seem to have a unique spark in between them and the story is really a tear jerker. I loved this movie from the time it was released in the theaters and watching it a second and third time has just renewed my appreciation for it!!!"
3,Harry Connick Jr. is reason enough to see this movie,"OK, this will be short and sweet. I realize that this movie isn't an Oscar winner but it's not a bad little flick either.If for no other reason, you should see it because of Harry Connick Jr. Whoever says he can't act obviously doesn't understand the art. He plays the role of a gentle, confident (and dead sexy) cowboy with perfect charm and grace. He makes you want to swoon just by walking in the room.A cowboy was the LAST thing I ever thought I could go for, but if I could find one like ""Justin Matisse,"" I wouldn't hesitate!!"
1,This film could have been much more than it was.,"I must be honest. If you like Saundra, there are ""moments,"" in this film. She is coy, and cute, but let's face it, the same could be said of food that has gone bad; you could pick a few bites that haven't spoiled entirely... Very weak. Please Saundra, make a sequel to ""While You Were Sleeping,"" like, ""Golly, You're Awake!! While You Were Sleeping Pt. II)"
3,Too cliche,"Too sterotype: teenage girl weds at eighteen, has happy family until later in life when he cheats on her, a typical sterotype of a child torn apart by her parent's divorce because most children are happy to see their parents seprate or at least they accept it they don't wish for them to get back together, teenage girl was popular cheerleader in high school and mean to classmates who grow up to hate her guts, woman needing man in her life to live, horribly old-fashioned because most women don't need men to live, and former friend who wants a romantic realionship with old childhood friend. It's eye-rolling cliches. Harry Connick Jr. is a hick, Gena Rowlands is too sterotype Southeran woman, Mae Whitman is Ok she's a wonderful actress but still kind of annoying, and Sandra Bullock is fine. My point is that nothing that goes on in this film could actually happen in real life. It's impossible. It's just a sterotype."
5,very loving and Sandra Bullock(my favorite actress)did great,I wanted to see this so bad so I did.I didn't like how Sandra Bullock had the texas akcent but it was really good.If you like love movies see this if you like Sandra Bullock look up her name and buy every movie see has made.
5,This was a tear jurker!!!,This was agreat movie. I really liked it. I was balling at the end so if you watch it garb a box of tissues.
5,An amazing book!,"I bought this book a few years ago and it ended up sitting on my shelf for about a year and a half. But when I finially picked it and started to read, I couldn't believe that I had let such a great book sit on my shelf for so long! Mutiny on the Bounty is now one my favorate books. Historically, it is fascinating, because the entire book is a true story. I highly recomend this book to any age, and I promise that even though it is a little bit hard to get into the book, you will be unable to put it down once you get started."
5,Amazing book,"I first read Children of Cain when I was working in human rights about 20 years ago. I was in my 20s then and bought it for everyone I knew who had a connection to the region. Tina has an amazing way of connecting you to the perpetuators of violence, understanding their stories, and when you almost sympathize with them, she pulls you back to the reality to the horror of what they are doing or have done. I still recommend the book to others especially students."
4,Not for a light reader...,"It was a very detailed novel, with really good insight into what really goes on (or went on) in Latin America. Although, I thought it had some graphic and disturbing details, so read carefully."
5,Rosenberg shows the roots of Latin American violence.,"Having recently returned from living in South America for two years, I was very interested in reading Tina Rosenbergs work. It did not disappoint me. From the poorest of the poor, to the wealthy untouchables, she captured the feeling of Latin America extremely well. She did this so well because she spent so much time with her subjects.For example, Gladys from Peru, she spent weeks with her, returning often. She did not gloss over the painful life that woman lives. Tina Rosenberg went to the core of why the Latin American countries are the way they are today: poverty and history. Poverty drives a young man in Columbia to do things for money that would turn our stomachs, such as kidnapping and murder; the history of his country and the region has made people too accustomed to this violence. Rosenberg exposes these roots so well, readers will feel that they are amongst the people of these struggling, violent countries"
5,Fascinating Women,"This book was issued in conjunction with an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museaum of Art in New York some years ago. However, the book is really much more than that. It gives brief biographies of 14 fascinating women from the Eighteenth Century. These were women such as Abigail Adams, Rose Bertin, Vigee-Lebrun and Madame Pompadour who were women of their time and yet, in many ways, curiously modern. Some defied convention, some worked within it, but all were unique personalities. The writing is enlightening and interesting and the illustrations are lovely. If you like the Eighteenth Century and women's place in history, you will enjoy this book."
3,"Well written, but exceedingly slow story","The Moor, another adventure of Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes by Laurie King, gets off to a slow start and never really picks up. The writing is flawless (King's talent in this regard is exceptional)but the story consists almost entirely of Holmes and Russell walking the Moor and finding nothing. While the Moor itself may be the focal point of the book, it's hardly enough to sustain real interest for mystery fans. This has been an entertaining series to date, but to continue in that vein, King must deliver exciting stories to accompany the mood and settings of turn of the century Britain."
3,A bit disappointing.,"THE MOOR starts well and ends well, but it's way too long -- with a lot of seemingly repetitive sequences (how many baths? how many walks on the moor?), at 369 pages I was begging for it to be over. I think a good editor could have cut out almost 100 pages. This is the fourth entry in the Mary Russell series, and Holmes is much less active this time. King continues to create a definite sense of time and place, and excellently weaves an eery mood. All the travel on the moor definitely makes you feel cold and wet. The plot provides great fun in that it revives ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" story in detail. You do NOT need to read the previous books in the series to understand THE MOOR. But quite frankly I enjoyed the previous books much more."
3,"Bogs down a bit, but still pretty good","Russell and Holmes find themselves on Dartmoor, location of his most famous adventure in the Hound of the Baskervilles. Another ghostly hound has been spotted on the moors, accompanying a ghostly carriage, and Holmes is investigating as a favor to his aged and dying friend the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould. This 4th volume of the series is a little on the tedious side as the reader goes over half the book slogging through pages of description of the wild, desolate, haunting moors and its curious inhabitants. While fascinating, this slowed the action down a bit as if caught in one of the moors' many bogs, but once it picked up again we are treated to as exciting and satisfying a conclusion as any Doyle has penned."
5,mary russell tapes,"My family absolutely loves these books and we think Jenny Stirlin does a great job as a reader. (Her American accents aren't the greatest, but she reads the book with familiarity.) I would highly recommend them as great books to listen to on a road trip."
1,Awful!,"This was my first and last Mary Russell novel and it doesn't surprise me that I'm not the first reviewer to say that. I'm not a purist so I don't mind it being unfaithful to the canon, but this book was just awful on its own merit. I agree completely with those who thought that this book was boring. I feel that ""The Moor"" was just a complete waste of my precious time and hard earned money. I will definitely not be reading anymore Laurie R. King books."
1,Well now Really!,"I guess that we should hand one star over to the author for creativity, but any true Doyle fan knows that Sherlock Holmes would never marry anyone. This novel is a disgrace to literature,and I am sure the great creator of Holmes is rolling over in his grave at the thought of this almost blasphemous pastiche. Not a good read. Go find the originals.... with this you are just wasting your time."
3,ms.lemon,"After reading the preceeding books in this series, I was really disappointed. It ran on forever about the rain, rocks, fog, and the travels over the moor. I got it already! Its was WET! I lost the thread of the story very early on. I think I should have just reread the original Hound of the Baskervilles. It would have been more interesting. The end was abrupt and unsatisfying. A review I read by another reader that said this should have been read before, out of order. She was right. OH JERUSALEM wasn't much better. The same theme of dirt, bugs, hostility. Ok. There's a lot of history in this one, but I wasn't looking for a history lesson. I MAY look into the next book in the series. I hope it gets back to the mysteries and relationship of Holmes and Russell. I'll read the sample and if it goes the same way as the last two then I'm done. Too bad. It started out great. We'll see."
2,Not very exciting,"This is the first book I have read by Laurie King, and I will have to try another before I judge her too harshly. This book was filled with rich ""sherlock holmes"" style story telling and fit the period nicely, but it had too little action for me and I found it too boring to finish. If you are looking for a fast paced thriller, this is not for you."
2,A reader from New York City,"This book is awfully slow going and pretty boring. The author spends most of her time describing things like her opinions, her surroundings, and the books she reads to fill in the time because even she is often bored. Unlike Conan Doyle's THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, the sense of mystery and tension just isn't in THE MOOR. Naturally, things pick up at the very end, but after trudging through some 400 pages to get there I mostly felt relief that the story was finally over."
3,"""The Moor"" is a disappointment","I had anticipated a story with suspense, spooky, erie scenes involving the moor. At least, I was hoping for some supernatural scenes, even if they would be eventually explained away later as some phosphorescent paint splashed onto a dog's face, or whatever. What I read was a story about a constantly bored Mary, and a boring story line. All the books I read are subjected to my own rating system from stupid or 0 to E for excellent. I almost did not want to finish this book, which would have meant a ""0"" rating, but I gave it a Fair rating, instead, partially because I love all Holmes stories. I was tempted to give it a ""stupid"" ratine, but I could not. In brief, there was almost no suspense, very little mystery, and a total lack of the power of Holmes' presence. So a fair rating was probably too high for this disappointing story."
3,Where's Mary?,"I am reading the Mary Russell books in order so I, obviously, don't have a problem with the premise of Mary and Sherlock working together. My problem with ""The Moor"" is that Mary is reduced to a mere plot device in the first half of the book. The only reason she is there is to give author King an excuse to write a Sherlock Holmes mystery. When Mary finally gets going in the second half, her role is much more diminished than in previous adventures. The second half of the book does make it all worthwhile, though. While not outstanding, ""The Moor"" is a decent read for fans of the Mary Russell series. If you haven't read any before, though, for heaven's sake don't start here. Go back to ""The Beekeeper's Apprentice"" and welcome aboard."
4,Beach Reading without shame!,"The fourth in the Mary Russell series. I agree with the other reviewers about the slow pace of the book - but I liked it. It's a great series - the books are generally a quick read, and usually touch on some topic in enough detail that your interest is sparked into finding a little more about what you're reading about."
2,What's Happened to Laurie?,"I was initially bowled over by Laurie King's ""Mary Russell"" series(and her Kate Martinelli series too). THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE remains one of the best Sherlock Holmes sequels ever. But it seems each Russell book is a bit less effective than the last. THE MOOR has some wonderful bits of atmosphere, and Ms. King always finds amusing character insights, but the book starts and ends with little of genuine interest ever happening. Halfway through I had to admit that there was nothing other than sheer stubborness to keep me reading."
5,CSI: NY Fourth Season,The company mailed the video set in very short order. The item was in excellent condition. I recieved the package well within the timeframe given.
4,Great continuation of her series,This book continues on in the tradition set by the Beekeepers Apprentice. It is wonderfully developed with a good plot line with lots of twists and turns. I really enjoy the character of Mary Russel and have been a sherlock holmes fan since I was a child. Great installment in a very good series.
4,Nothing like it,"For those of us who are visual, the bird-call diagrams in this book are particularly helpful, and I've not found them in any other book. For example, we are shown that a Ring-Necked Pheasant exhibits a wing-whir after its song, even thought it can be difficult to hear in actual recordings.Some of the bird names, both common and scientific, are a bit out of date. The Boreal Chickadee is called the Acadian Chickadee here. Sedge Wren is Short Billed Marsh Wren.At rough count, there seem to be around 200 bird species documented here, and they (like many birding books) appear to have a slightly east-coast bias."
3,Ok but I expected more,"I own a lot of Cheekygirls Production DVDs and I always love them, because they are very professional, full of useful information and great value for money.I was a bit disappointed in the content of this DVD. I expected a lot more about musicality and understanding music, but there is only a small introduction about Arabic music and its structure as such, while the most part of the DVD is made up of the choreography explanation. It is a very nice choreography and Andalee is lovely and very good at explaining things, so that's good but I was expecting something different.I was pleasantly surprised by the bonus DVD on Project Bellydance. I was expecting to be a boring reality show, of the type that is all the rage nowadays on TV. Instead I found it interesting, an inspiration and full of interesting tips for belly dancers and fun to watch. Sometimes it tries to be like TV reality shows, but fortunately the result is quite different."
1,This is not the red album with a gold star. It is various artists playing russian music.,"I wish some record company would put the band Russia album on cd, but so far I haven't been able to find it. Thought this cd was it from some of the reviews, but it's not. So do not waste your money like I did believing the positive reviews. They must have been written by Terra Russia so they could sell more cd's."
5,Tastes great!,"I purchased this item because of my wheat allergy, but it tastes even better than the semolina elbows that I was using. It cooks up in 7 minutes and even my husband who has no food allergies loves it!"
4,Some errors,A very good book. Perhaps I can help to fix some errors. Here two: on page 516 the correct answer to the question 10 is c (not d as indicated); on page 526 the correct answer to question 3 is d (not c as indicated).
4,Look for Inaccuracy in some headings.,"The book so far is very good but I need to point out that on page 34 on the right side of the page is an inaccuracy in the labeling of the pen tools. The fourth pen, which is Add anchor point, is marked Convert-anchor point. The last pen which is in reality is Convert, is marked Add so watch for others that may also be in the wrong order."
2,Not his best book!,"This book has about 2 good essays, which are about 5 pages each. There are some exercises which most people with arthritis could not perform. I work with elderly people and teach Qi gong to them. Most of the exercises are not specific to arthritis any more than T'ai Chi or any other Qi gong style would be.I have many fine books from the author, this is not one of them."
5,GREAT,It's a flashlight. Great light and small clips easily onto something and easy to keep in the car. Love it.
3,Great light but not good for pockets,I love this light. this is my 3rd one. The only issue is that use it on my key ring and in my pocket the button always seems to push and the light drains itself in my pocket.
2,Great lights when they work: had two go bad on me,"These are great lights when they work, however, I've had two go bad on me. The first one lasted for a few months, then it would either turn itself on, (yes, without the button being accidentally hit; often times my keys would just be sitting on the table and suddenly the light would turn on), or when I would turn it on, it couldn't be shut back off unless I took the batteries out.Princeton Tec customer service was great; I told them about the problem and they just shipped me a new one, no charge, and I didn't have to return the defective light. However, that light went bad too, doing the exact same thing as the first light only the problems started almost immediately (within weeks of getting it)With both lights, I did try putting brand new batteries in and for both lights it made no difference.Never again. I know I could get another free light from Princeton Tec, but why bother? It's more trouble than it's worth."
4,Great light but could be smaller,"This is a very good light in every way, except that it is a bit larger than I really like for carrying in my pocket. It works well, and doesn't turn on in my pocket or purse like the other brand I had. I also think the clip on the end is great - doesn't open too easily on mine."
2,So close and yet....,"This little guy was soooo close to what I was looking for, but it has one major issue depending on what you want to do with it. I like clipping it to a belt loop. If you wear jeans and try to do this, it attaches snugly but smoothly, but is nearly impossible to get back off. The carabiner-type opening is too near the edges so it is very difficult to remove it from a belt loop. If this is your intended use, look elsewhere."
5,Sturdy and good for the earth,I hate those bargain plates that are so thin you need four for a tuna sandwich!.....These plates are strong and made from recycled corn stalks. I like them so much I have been getting a case of them automatically ever three months for three years.
5,Sonos ZP80,Just wanted to say that I received this item promptly andit has performed as a new would would.Very satisfied with dealing with this Amazon partner.
4,Excellent Add-on Player,"I plugged this in last weekend for one my clients, and it works superbly. We connected one ZP80 to a set of Polk Atrium 45p speakers, and another ZP80 to a set of Advent AV70? speakers, and they sound great. I recommend these for use with smaller speakers, as they will deliver enough satisfactory sound. For larger speakers, though, I recommend the ZP100, with its built in amplifier.Set-up of the ZP80 was remarkably easy. I do wish the 2-minute ""activation"" period was a little bit longer so I wouldn't have to run around to connect each machine to the wireless subnet that the Sonos systems create and use.Highly recommended."
4,learn to write well,"Capture your readers' attentions through...well style. The book was really a text book for a class I took. And because the book helped me through the rough patches of my essay writing, I started suggesting it to my proteges.I'm going to assume I wouldn't have bought the book if I didn't have to. But I think it deserves the chance."
2,Makes okay coffee but...,"The coffee is okay... it's not brilliant but then again if you want brilliant you tend to spend a lot more than this...The problem with this item is that you cannot pour out of it without coffee going everywhere... well, you can, but it takes a very long, very slow pour to do it...Wouldn't recommend..."
5,Top-Notch Puppet,"If you're deciding on a puppet, this is definitely one of the best. It is silky soft and very cute. On the full-grown kanga, you can animate it's full body head, and top feet. And the joey is a finger puppet! I was very impressed with the quality.Kids really adore playing with puppets and you can't go wrong with this one."
5,Educational yet fun!,"I bought this product for a presentation about kangaroos. It is very soft and easy to work with. The joey falls out of the pouch alot and i've been told it looks a little creepy but the kangaroo puppet is cute, soft and a good buy if you are looking for a kangaroo puppet."
4,"Controversy, theology, ambiguity","This may be the most controversial (to modern culture) play that Shakespeare wrote. It deals with the racial disparities popularly belived in Shakespeare's day to exist between Christians and Jews. Christianity is presented as a tenet of generosity, goodwill, charity, celebration, and joy. Judaism, however, is contrasted starkly as a sort of disease that plagues its followers, causing them to be miserly and humorless. Shakespeare gives us some very direct social commentary that rivals his work in The Tempest. Evidence that Shakes is trying to make a point is the way he plants a typical Jewish merchant with reasonable grievances in a field of blind and clearly absurd (albeit our modern bias of ""evolved sensibilities"") stereotypes accepted as the norm. The regular helping or irony is served up by an ambiguously glossy denouement, leaving more questions than answers on justice and prejudice."
2,Give me lines!,"The play itself is fantastic; my warning is about this version. I bought the Dover Thrift edition for my class because it is inexpensive. But to my chagrin, the edition does not have line numbers. It made it near impossible to use efficiently in class. Just a word of warning."
5,This Dark Comedy Will Disturb Your Thought To A Higher Level,"Shakespeare takes advantage of a common bigotry of his day, appears to justify the bigotry to make a crowd pleaser, but slips in question marks to this way of thinking with each step of the story. The bigot will feel like his feet are slipping with each step; the highly righteous politically correct people will be suckered into outrage. When all's said and done, Portia will remain in your mind."
3,GOOD EDITION: AND OTHER ALTERNATIVES,"Till today, every pen-stroke William Shakespeare made draws respect. This ""Merchant Of Venice"" is no exception. The story remains tasty despite its age.However, since this particular edition harbours all the ingredients of Sixteenth Century English, many readers (particularly the young) who are only at-home with the contemporary English may find it hard to digest. In this case, reading the simpler 'Merchant Of Venice' part of ""Lamb's Tales From Shakespeare"" (adapted by Charles and Mary Lamb) would be nice, before journeying into this one.Also, it may make more economic sense (for Shakespeare lovers) to add a couple of dollars atop the price of this book and instead, purchase ""The Complete Works of William Shakespeare"". There are many cheap, lightweight editions of this 'Complete Works'. And with it, you have access to all the Shakespearean works: those Comedies, Tragedies, and Poetries."
3,The Characters,"The book ""Merchant Of Venice"" was a classic that I enjoyed reading. The characters particularly brrought the story to life and a joy to read, the romance, the heartache, the hatred. This was my first Shakespeare play that I have read and I am now about to read Romeo and Julliet."
1,An A-typical performance for a superb playwright,"although we are fans of Shakespeare and his other works, we have found this play to be below usual Shakespeare standards. Billy Shakes did a poor job of combining three unoriginal story lines the result being something may have served as shallow entertainment for Elizabethian audience of peasants, but compared to other works it fails in containing any moral or intellectual value. Try MacBeth or even Romeo and Juliet.... We seriously believe, even though it has been emphasized that Billy has mocked the place of women in society though they seem triumphant. We resent the fact the switching of the roles, which looks as if Billy were jesting them. As stated before, other plays of Billy Shakes were better and we recommend those."
4,a problem play,"this is a very difficult play to watch or read. while shakespeare may have intended shylock to be a villain, to a modern sensibility, he is the victim of society's racism. frankly, i had far more sympathy for shylock than for the christian characters. and i'm not jewish. or christian. i found the treatment of shylock appalling, and while i think a ""pound of flesh"" was too dear a price to pay for forfeiting the bond, i believe antonio deserved to lose his wealth. he - and bassanio and portia and all the rest - are irredeemable bigots, and therefore, thoroughly detestable. mov is a good portrayal of bigotry, but it is an impossible play to like when none of the characters are likeable."
1,Not what I paid for,"downloaded the Kindle for PC edition for my Shakespeare class, and discovered it's not a parallel text. It's just Shakespeare's original text. I will be filing a complaint."
3,A good interesting work.,"This book is all about the lives of Antonio, Bassinio and also talks about the distinctions between the Jews and the Christians. A pleasure to read."
3,They were great!,"Having been at Mar-Y-Sol here in Puerto Rico, I saw Nitzinger play. They played just before Cactus. The Cactus players were behind the amps totally involved in what they were hearing and seeing. At the end of the show we were asking for an encore even though we knew cactus was coming up next! This last cd by nitzinger is good, if you like Blues. But I miss the hardrock side of Nitzinger. Hope their next one will be in that vein."
5,My favorite album of 6000 in my collection,"John Nitzinger wrote one third of the first four Bloodrock albums, too bad he did not sing them, his voice is so much better. When I saw the albums ""Nitzinger"" and ""One Foot In History"" in the record store in 1973, I wondered if it could be the same Nitzinger I had noticed in the Bloodrock song credits. I wasn't sure. Unfortunately I skipped the chance.In 1976 I saw the cassette of ""One Foot In History"" for $1.00 and took the chance.About that time my job location shifted to 45 minutes away (the length of the tape) I played it through every morning and again every afternoon for months - never tiring of the delicious subtleties and highly energetic arrangement. I sang along, not realizing some errors in my listening until I finally found the vinyl LP in 1985 - the lyrics within fed me chagrin. Also I was stunned to discover the amazing drummer was . . . A Woman. . . Linda Warring.Enjoy."
5,great music,"THIS ALBUM ROCKS MY HOUSE.BUYING ALL OF SUGAR RAYS & BLUETONES ALBUMS,THIS IS A KEEPER,EVERY CUT ON THIS CD IS NOTHING BUT GREAT MUSIC."
1,Threw it away,It slowed my download speed by half. Bought a XyZel ZyWALL USG 2.0 and I am very satisfied with it.
1,Be careful there is a newer model v3 with better cpu!,"Be careful! Netgear is not telling people that there are 3 versions of the FVS318 (v1, v2 and v3)! Version 3 has a better CPU and uses a different firmware (v3.0). I feel cheated! Because Netgear sells all the older FVS318 as though they are all the same! Not the newest v3 model! What a low life company somebody should sue them. If the Netgear FVS318 has a new cpu then give it a new model number! But they don't, so most of us are buying earlier out-of-date models! Those of us who thought we were buying the latest model were being scammed and defrauded! Shame on Netgear!"
5,Creating energy within and beyond,"For such a cheap price...Julie Henderson provides you with exercises and explanations towards the cultivation of sexual energy and how to share that with a lover. There are instructors/author's within the marketplace who charge an ""arm"" and a ""leg"" to explain & share such knowledge. Also, there is the right balance of academic references & influences from other therapeutic studies that make this a great place as a foundation towards energy."
3,2.5/5 Stars for this FLA Side Project,"Yikes, this was like listening to one of those scratchy hip hop albums with the thought of ""What in the heck am I listening too?"". I suppose everyone has their likes and dislikes. This album didn't appeal to me at all. It was gruesome to listen too and the music didnt blend of mix well at all. Only one song from the entire album was listenable and that was 'Nothing Stays'. This is a side project from the producers of FLA. Another Canadian production from the Vancouver studios. If you are looking for FLA style beats and rhythms you won't find them here. This is a missable album. Go for any release by Front Line Assembly itself...much more listenable and user friendly."
3,violence,"This is a lovely book, except for one small episode of violence. Nevertheless, you can use this opportunity to teach a lesson. When you read this book to your child, you can stop and explain to them that it is wrong to hit someone."
5,"EXELENT, DEFINATELY GET THIS",THIS VIDEO RULED! IF YOUR A MAJOR D-X FAN YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTLY BUY THIS VIDEO.
3,New DX Dvd,"Crotch-chopping, brash, obnoxious, naked, rule-breaking, icon, showstopper, muscular, beautiful, blood-covered, pyro blasts, main events, obscenity-laced, declaring war, pissing everyone off, DX-rated home movies, sweet chin music.Learn all about D-Generation X.Kids, put your parents to bed!

UndertakerRoyal Rumble 98 Casket MatchShould a pretty decent dvd the only thing different from the vhs will be the eigth extra matches include. But still worth it especiallty if you never seen the vhs."
3,it's a hot movie,"This didn't have enough of Chyna's goods if you smell what the Bun I'm cooking. That Jobber HHH, I could kick his carrots! He has no chance in Bun against Bun-Bun, he's an all out Rabbit!"
5,VHS way better then the dvd,"I have the original WWF VHS release of this tape. When shopzone released the DX Package featuring this VHS now on dvd, I was excited. Boy was i wrong, I knew they where going to blur out the WWF logo. No big deal, but they've also EDITED out the cussing, and some of the offical footage the VHS had. The only thing good about the dvd is the eight extra matches and the cool menu screen. Do like I did first of all, transfer your VHS version to DVD, Way to go WWE."
5,DX is the best,"I'm 15 and I rented this video. It's certainly not for kids but it's very funny. Everything is uncensored and that let's you have the full effect. The video focuses more on the formation of DX, than what it is now."
5,Absolutely hiliarious,"Whereas ""Three faces of Foley"" had a tremendous story, this was definately one of the funniest tapes I've ever seen, and Im not just talking Wrestling tapes. This is truly a must own!"
4,"Great Video however,.....",I really enjoyed reliving the past and my wife liked seeing HHH as pre-Evolution. I was dissappointed that there wasn't more about the New Age Outlaws. Overall I would recommend this video to anyone who is into wrestling.
4,Good history of D.X.,This video was great and gave the whole history of the group. The only problem was that they made this video too soon cause its mostly of when D.X. had Shawn Michaels it needs more stuff of the New Age Outlaws and X-Pac.
4,Oh you didn't know!,"This video shows an indepth view of one of the most popular groups to ever grace the squared circle. You get a look at good matches from the ""Heart Brake Kid"" Shawn Michaels, HHH, and the New Age Outlaws. I only gave this video 4 stars (which is still good) because of the lack of footage of X-Pac in the ring. In conclusion, I only have two words for you...BUY IT!"
4,"Language, nudity, it's a great tape!","This is a very good tape for somebody that may not be a DX fan. Seeing Hunter, XPac, Chyna, Roaddog, and Billy Gunn uncensored is very entertaining. Shows the history of how they started. Watch it and you'll find yourself going around saying, ""S*CK IT!"""
5,The Second Half of Life: Opening the Eight Gates of Wisdom,"This is an amazing read. Thoughtful,introspective a real gem for the second half of life. We all can use the gates."
1,Good if you have a lot of uncommitted/ unstructured time.,"Listening to the audio tape edition is a trying experience. Dr. Arrien has a soporific monotonous presentation througout much of the reading, which is punctuated by irregular breaths not synchronous with the phrasing. This is very distracting. There are a few kernels of brilliance, but you have to listen to a lot of chaff to discover them. Much of the story-telling is painstakingly drawn out, taking forever to get to the point. I kept hoping it would get better, but it never did. We would not have purchased it, had we had this information."
1,Battered Book with No Dust Jacket,The book 'The Second Half of Life: Opening the Eight Gates of Wisdom' that we received came to us battered and without a dust jacket. We are not happy with our purchase but are going to keep it for ourselves instead of giving it as a gift.
2,ok after 50 advice,A semi decent guidebook of how to handle life at 50 and beyond. I found some of the text stale to get thru. there were some very helpful areas that im sure that i will retain but for themost part i found this ti be a little too fluffy and 'spiritual'.
1,Did she make these gates up?,"This is the first time I fell asleep 4 times before the audio book was half way done. These gates she talks about, did she just make them up? This woman is no dummy, but I think she is still living off the fame of ""Women who dance with wolves."" Anyone who wants to see how easy it is to write your own e-book or audio book should read this. Its a chop suey of Joseph Campbell myth work, dull quotes and the rest I cant understand what she is trying to piece together. This is like a quilt where every piece not only doesnt match, but every color is dull. Give this to all your co-workers at Christmas time you really hate but want to let them think you like them. Were the people who gave this 5 stars all relatives of hers?"
4,BETTER THAN THE AUDIO TAPES,"If you're looking for a way to effectively cope with challenges to your health and body as you age, you can add this book to the list, The author takes us through looking at our secret longings and how they shape us. I especially liked the questions and assignments at the end of eacy segment. I enjoyed reading the book more than I enjoyed listening to it --- because some of the concepts are deeply profound, I needed to go back over them and this was easier done with book in hand. Pamela D. Blair, Author The Next Fifty Years: A Guide for Women at Mid-Life And Beyond"
5,Wisdom for us all,"Angeles Arrien provides a wonderful guidebook on how to thoughtfully deepen our own personal growth in wisdom during The Second Half of life. I found this beautiful book of stories, poetry, photos and reflections very inspiring. I especially like the reflections and practices at the end of each gate that asked the questions that made me think about what is really important in my life and what do I want to pass on to others. This book makes a wonderful gift and I have given it to many of my friends to enjoy."
5,Powerful message,"The Second Half of Life: Opening the Eight Gates of WisdomI found this book well written and easy to read. The message was extremely powerful for me at this point in my life, and I found myself wishing I had read this book before I retired. In a society focused on youth, vitality and glamour, this book affirms the value of all life and at all stages of life."
5,Arrien is great,For anyone over 50 and on a spiritual path this is a great book. Symbolic phases of personal growth after 50.
5,"The Second half of Life, Opening the Eight Gates of Wisdom","Thia book is changing my life. Just sent the 3rd book to friendsafter buying one for me. Highly recommend this book and thisauthor, Angeles Arrien."
4,Traditional Regency,"Or possibly three and a half. Contains a despicable villain, a grey cat called Merlin, and lots of people giving well-meant advice.From the back of the book:Relations between the Chandlers and the St Clairs were not good, considering Nicholas Chandler had eloped with the wife of Devin St Clair, the Marquis of Huntington. Now the two families had to meet, for Dev's sister Jessica was to marry Adam Chandler Dev had no idea when he attended the betrothal party that he would end up engaged to Nicholas's sister, Sarah, all because he had come to her rescue when she got into difficulties! What possible success could such a marriage have?A Regency delight!MILLS & BOON"
5,Go Girl Groups,"This is a nice two CD set. It has a total of 30 songs and all of them are great. There some groups on it that I did not even know they existed. Some of the groups and songs are: Lesley Gore (It's My Party), The Toys (A Lover's Concerto), The Ikettes (I'm Blue), The Shangri-Las (Leader of the Pack), Linda Scott (I've Told Every Little Star) and Mary Wells (Two Lovers). Get it today."
5,Like Fatboy? Get this CD!,"Faboy Slim has had a reputation for being a master of remixes, and this compilation is no dissappointment. This CD is worth buying just for Psyche Rock, E.V.A., and Payback [my personal favorites], but there are quite a few other decent tracks on there as well. No true Fatboy fan's collection would be complete without this!Peace, FireTiger"
2,well i should have known ..,"I personally find norman cooks music rather dull .. but i love his Djing .. On the floor of the boutique really is one of the best CD's out there .. and one of the best dj albums period , only hurt by his own personal songs (really the whole mix looses momentum and seems to drag on when he drops his personal tracks) but his remixes have allways been rather simple( he kinda old school remixes leaving the back bone and only adding some heavier beats mostly) and his personal music is good, but always wears old within 2 mins .. cause he doesn't seem to know how to do something with it or even end it without just letting it repeat over and over into obsurdity . much more dj friendly than home stereo friendly .. this is probably much better if you can stand his own tracks .. on the floor of the boutique is Highly recommended though"
3,not the Fatboy your used to...,I picked the cd up yesterday. at a local store(which inclued a x-tra cd of the full EVA cut)thinking this was going to be like the fatboy slim I know and love But..... its not. it mostly from Norman cooks elecronic-reggie/dance hall days. its a good cd but not for the normal techno head out there if this was just a reggie cd It would have 4 stars but its under dance.
2,not exactly as advertised!,I bought this CD specifically for the Beats International material and was disappointed that these are the original mixes of WON'T TALK ABOUT IT and DUB BE GOOD TO ME rather than the Norman Cook remixes. These songs are EITHER remixed OR produced by FS/NC but not necessarily BOTH. A shame!
2,"Don't quit your day job, Norman!","Ok, I've listened to Fat Boy Slim. That guy's stuff isn't bad, by no means main stream, but worth while. But ... this Norman Cook - he's horrible. It's no wonder Cook developed an alter ego. With the exception of a few easily recognisable tunes, I couldn't believe this ""stuff"" had come from the same artist that produced Praise You. Renegade Master is the type of track I've come to know and respect (that one is a keeper), and I have to give props for I Left My Wallet in El Segundo. Other than that, this album sounds like someone mixed songs from the first dozen records they found during their expedition to the flea market. If this is the sound you're looking for, save a few bucks, check out your local yard sales. So as not to be too negative, I'll say this; the printing job on the CD itself is charming. The notion of making it look like a turntable was inspired."
5,Great for fitness folks,"I am a Spinning instructor and a runner and I love using many of these songs. I was turned on to this album by another Spinning instructor and though I haven't been a huge Fatboy Slim fan in the past, this album is great. This music is also frequently in my earbuds on the treadmill--it's a very catchy way to pass an hour."
4,Sorta-kinda Carribean Techno,"An album produced by Fatboy Slim, this is a nice addition to a collection that contains ""You've Come A Long Way, Baby."" I was first exposed to this album in 2000 and I have come upon it time and time again in different situations. Finally, I have purchased it. Many of the songs have kinda-sorta Carribean beats; there are also some seemingly familiar tunes, maybe from commercials, or perhaps past tunes that were remixed. Whatever the case, it is nice music with which to drive, especially. Take a listen to some of the tracks and see if you like the style, or not!"
3,Something New but Where's the Old,"This is really not your normal run of the mill Fatboy Slim. If there was a three and a half star rating, I'd rate this CD 3 1/2 stars. Now a lot of the reviews either give this CD a VERY high rating or a fairly low one. If you want an opinion from a hardcore Fatboy Slim fan (for many many years) If you like Old Fatboy Slim and I do mean OLD Fatboy Slim, as in ""I'm going out of my head"" days, don't get this CD. If your looking for something fresh, by all means buy it."
3,Fat Boy Slim/Norman Cook Collection,"This album is pretty groovy and funky, but not hugely exciting. It's good background music, or Saturday bopping-around-the-house-doing-some-housework music. Nice and happy, and sure to get you grooving, but it's before the time of Funk Soul Brother, so it's much more basic than his later stuff. Simple, smooth, fun, funky, but not Weapon of Choice."
5,Beautiful!,"For the past five years or so, I have been hunting for two of my all-time favorite albums on CD. I received a copy of Mary Hopkin's ""Earth Song/Ocean Song"" for my birthday - I can only imagine how much my friend paid for it. Two weeks later, I found out ""If You Saw Thro' My Eyes"" was being rereleased on CD. I ordered it immediately, and finally - finally!! - it arrived this morning, and is playing as I type.""Beautiful"" is really the only word to describe this work. Every single song takes your breath away. And the CD really shows off the magnificence of the arrangements and lyrics.If you are a fan of great songwriting, buy it!"
5,great tool for auditioning,I have read a few books on auditioning and Darren Cohen's book is by far the most informative and gives you the most effective tools for great auditions. Since reading it my auditions have gotten so much better and I am much more comfortable in the audition room. This book is a must for any actor or musical theatre person!!
2,half-hearted effort,"the information in this book is not bad, but the way in which it is presented is confusing and poorly edited. there are many mistakes, from the quiz answers assigned to the wrong questions to misspelled words. i would highly recommend cliffsap biology in place of this."
2,Sized small!,"These shoes are sized about 1 to 1.5 sizes smaller than what I generally wear. I'm sure that they are great shoes, but if you cant get them on then really they are of no use. I returned them and they were out of stock..."
4,More than a Soundtrack,"Upon first seeing this film I was engaged in the psychological dystopia and hallucinogenic imagery, then I realized I didn't really care for the film as much as the soundtrack. I'm blown away by the music Alan Vega contributed, it's sort of like having a new Alan Vega album with bits of soundbites from the movie scrunched in between it. Definitely cool Vega tracks and lots of them."
1,Dead after 4 months!,"So I actually upgraded to the Bytecc 350 after another enclosure failed. This one worked great for a good 4 months or so (although I must say the ""fashion led"" light is extremely annoying). Then all of a sudden the enclosure started beeping at me and my PC no longer recognized the drive. I tested the HD (Seagate 80 GB) in a different PC and it's working fine. Still no response from Bytecc customer service. I am done with external enclosures. I am going to go with a full external hard drive from Maxtor, at least they will respond to support requests!"
4,Stolen Smolen,It was an ok movie predictable. The saving grace was the action. Need better story line. It stole a couple of hours of my time and was somewhat entertaining.
4,Review for Stolen,"Thrilling movie! Nicholas Cage, as usual, has acted very well in the movie. The story, though a little farfetched is nevertheless good."
2,Formulaic,This movie just goes through the motions. Acting is lukewarm at best. The plot was inane.Don't waste your money.
3,ehh,"This movie was a good take on the whole heist action flick. I am just not a huge Nicholas Cage fan, so it only scored a three. If you like him more than I do you may think this deserves a better rating."
2,ok,"Not a movie that I would purchase for home. It was ok. I can't even remember what I didn't like about it, just that it wasn't worth remembering."
4,Good action Picture!,"Nicolas Cage does a good job being a bank robber, and so happen to get retribution for his past and change his life for his little girl with a second chance at life after he is released from federal prison. A good B Movie!"
4,Nicolas Cage an Josh Lucas,"I liked this movie, of course I liked pretty much anything by Nicolas Cage and because Josh Lucas was in it just made it that much better.........."
1,"stolen, for real.",I paid for the video but could not get it to download to watch .I was very disappointed not being able to watch the movie .
3,Disappointing,"Definitely not as good as many other crime movies. The movie is lacking a strong plot. However, this movie does have entertaining content and cast. For a crime movie it is missing in-depth crime planning for quest."
3,Ineed money so I'll make a knock off movie,"This was not Nicolas Cages best effort by a long shot , it was watchable but this type of movie has been done again and again, he has been going steadily down hill in my opinion."
1,WAY too predictable. A yawner.,"So boring, I started doing my taxes while it played. Actually helped. Rent this movie if you're in the mood for an 80s Kojak episode that runs a little longer than usual."
3,Decent movie,"It is Nicholas Cage for crying out loud. Good plot, and thankfully not too much Nicholas Cageesque moments in the movie."
4,Intense,I enjoyed it a lot . Pretty intense as well..I would recommend it! Another Nicholas Cage great movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He is the best!
1,Hit and Miss With Nic,"In the last 3 years Nic Cage has made dozens of movies. With Nic Cage movies, it is either very bad or very good. In this case the movie was very bad. This movie had a lot of potential, but everybody involved in the making of this movie did not bring their A game."
4,Good Watch,The movie was entertaining so I feel like it was worth the watch. Can't say that it would win any awards. Kinda duplicates the theme of other bank robbery and kidnapping movies.
5,Great,Great movie. Nicolas Cage did a great jobin this movie.I would reccommend it to everyone. Lots of action and suspense.
2,I like Nicolas Cage....usually,"I know many don't like old Nick, but I typically find his movies enjoyable and entertaining. This one just didn't do it for me, though. If I hadn't paid for it, I probably wouldn't have finished watching it...but I felt like I had to get my moneys worth. You could certainly find worse movies out there...but don't expect much."
2,TRUTH,This is one of those movies that should be FREE! Nick Cage has made some fun movies...but this is not one of them. Pick something else.
1,Video feed was terrible,"My wife and I get movies all the time from Amazon, and although the movie was good it stopped at least 20 times during the course of play."
1,Could have been a contender,"Regretfully, Stolen had potential. But, it did not deliver. Nicolas Cage movie's are almost always ""good"". This one makes me happy I watched it on Amazon. My wife wanted to delete it after 20 minutes, but we suffered through. Poor plot, bad acting, and unconvincing villain make this a loser."
2,Nick Cage Needs To make Cash Movie - To Pay IRS,"Formula, crap, old tired story- Cage would have passed on junk like this, but took the part to get paid... He's been making a few of these as of late, I suppose to pay his high back Tax debt... Too bad he's really deluting himself..."
2,Never has a movie that takes place during Mardi Gras been so boring.,"Nicholas Cage continues his streak of poor acting and genuine lack of enthusiasm in STOLEN. It's somewhat worth enduring Nicholas Cage for the true star of this movie - a CG pineapple sinking in the ocean, symbolizing Nicholas Cage's acting career since Raising Arizona."
3,Not good but not the best movie either,"This movie is not the best Nicholas cage movie I seen, its not the worst either.I wouldnt waste my $$ on this again. FYI only watch it if you can watch it for free."
4,Classic Nicolas Cage,"I can't help it. I'm a Nicolas Cage action movie junkie. Face off, Snake Eyes, National Treasure, Next, on and on. If Cage is in it and its done halfway decent, I'm probably going to like it. Cage is intense, believable and likable as an action star, and its best when hes on the run and all the odds are against him. ""Stolen"" fits that bill to a tee. Classic Nicolas Cage, back against the wall, on the run, everyone in the world out to get him and running out of time. Loved every minute of it. Fun, exciting, good story line and Cage on the run. Nothing but fun."
3,Action filled.,"Not Nicholas Cage,s best work but fair. Twists and turns as well as unexpected surprises. I would recommend if you like him."
2,Meh,"Nic Cage might have done a nice job in his role, but the movie suffers from a cliche plot. I'm not kidding, I saw pretty much EVERYTHING coming before it did. His daughter being kidnapped. The happy reunion. The hidden heist. I mean, just about every plot point in here has been done to death. Using ONE of these plot points would have been adequate, but when you mash in a whole bunch of them, it makes for a rather predictable story. Bleh."
2,"Review of Nicolas Cage's Movie ""Stolen""",I liked that Nic Cage was in it.It was not one of his stronger roles.Story line was weak.
2,Run of the Mill,I watched this film just two days ago and have already forgotten the plot. I guess that says it all.
2,Another Career,Nicholas Cage should find himself another line of work. The only thing that kept my interest was the girl accomplice. Oh and the car scenes gave this movie the 2 Stars.
3,Cage & the IRS,"This movie is very predictable, Either Cage loves New orleans or it is cheap to film movies there. So long as Cage owes the IRS back taxes he will continue to make these types of films. I lke cage as an Actor, but am disappointed his career has been making movies that are made to go straight to DVD. This movie is entertaning enough to past time. Compare to the movie The Paperboy Cage's movie is oscar worhty. Worth a viewing if you are a Cage fan."
4,Location Nawlins,"I was surprised that it was filmed entirely in New Orleans, which in some movies doesn't work well. They even use the overgrown theme park that closed a few years ago. Josh Lucas is indeed a well rounded actor and he played quite a different role than I am used to him portraying. He did it well. Cage was in a similar style. It wasn't outstanding but overall it was certainly worth watching."
5,Stolen with Nicolas Cage is fun.,Nicolas Cage is never boring. His characters charge forward with or without help and somehow come to a good conclusion.
4,edge-of-your-seat entertaiment,"If you like Taken then you will like this, it's pretty much the same story except this time they are messing with Cage. Josh Lucas is also fun to look at. Simon West is a very underrated action director. This movie is fast-paced from beginning to end. And there is a very exciting car crash. So just relax and you will enjoy it. By the way don't listen to critics' review because they want you to believe this is the worst film of all time which it is not. It is a piece of entertainment and it serves its purpose well. Critics are just so boring they like everything that's pretentious but not a fun action thrill ride. And did I mention Malin Akerman is hot!!!!! I highly recommend it."
1,Dumb,Its a stupid and boring movie. Very predictable. Don't waste your time. I should have looked at the other reviews first.
1,Pathetic,One of the worst movies I have seen in recent times. Use your time and money to do something better.
1,Communication Book not Effective,"I purchased this book for my staff to read as part of improving the communication in our group. It was pretty basic; nothing in there we didn't already know. Even thought the author wrote it for adults in mind, it seemed like it was more on a child's level. It was not helpful at all. The group didn't finish the last two chapters: ""Getting a Letter to Its Destination"" and ""Communicating Using Technology"" - not worth the money."
4,Mastering Communication,"The book discusses skills that are invaluable tools to interacting with people. Effective communication skills are essential for success in business and personal lives.What the author writes sounds obvious but we tend to forget, communicate badly, and often make a bad situation worse by the way we communicate. Those wishing to learn the basics of communication or just want to refresh their expertise in this field will find the book useful and helpful.The book will help the reader to understand effective communication, and it explains how to communicate your message in the best possible way. After reading the book, you should have a better understanding of how to communicate effectively, to people and groups, through spoken, written and non verbal communications.This is a practical book that I return to often. This is a valuable book for anyone who is having problems in communications."
2,Pardon me but I think I've heard this before,"I bought this because I liked the Lite It Up release and the reviews were for the most part positive. I was very disappointed. It sounds like a dozen other bands of the era; D tuning, howling vocals, boring guitar solos. The revelation is there's no revelation."
2,Disturbed Jr?,"For some reason, as i listened to this album, I kept picutring David Drainman from Disturbed's less evil twin as the vocalist for this band. I also expected the singer to break out into the chorus of ""Stupify"" at any moment as well. Oh well. This band is pretty much like any other hard rock band out at the moment. The usual quite verse followed by a heavy chorus. Nothing new or to write home about."
4,"Good, Solid Hard Rock","The Up Side: Revelation Theory sort of flew under my radar earlier this year when they released Selfish and Cold, so I'm a bit new to these guys, but if Truth Is Currency is any indication of what greatness this band will become, they've got a fan for life in me. Currency is refreshing hard rock in the vein of Staind and early Breaking Benjamin, a style that seems to have dropped off quite a bit in recent years. From Out Of Our Hands to Over The Line, RT packs 10 gems back to back for a pleasing 30+ minutes.The Down Side: Currency is pretty short. A couple more songs would have rounded things out nicely. Also, one of my favorite RT songs, Far From Home, isn't on here!!The Conclusion: Fans of Seether, Staind, Breaking Benjamin and Allele should find alot to enjoy on Truth Is Currency. Even casual rock/nu-metal fans can enjoy the singles, so what are you waiting for? GET IT!!!"
3,"No Revelations, Just A Solid Rock Album.","Take your first listen to Revelation Theory's debut, ""Truth Is Currency"" and you can conjure up countless bands to compare these guys to. If David Draiman of Disturbed mated with Alter Bridge's Myles Kennedy and fronted a band influenced by nothing but Staind and Seether, you would have Revelation Theory. It's true, this band is not covering any new bases. However, fans of the genre will find an album that is easy to pick up and listen to. Despite not being a very long effort at that, it is to the point and most importantly, just rocks.There are ten songs on ""Truth Is Currency."" Eight of them are hard-rocking ear candy. Two of them are modern-rock ballads -- ""Selfish And Cold"" and ""Over The Line."" Since these are the two songs that step outside the boundaries, they are by defualt the best of the album. But on the whole, it's a solid listen. I wish I had more to say about it, but do the math. Ten songs plus a familair sound equals not much to say."
5,awesome cd,"i bought this cd and their latest one the other day and this one hands done is better. its short but every song is good. every chorus is great too. i didnt even skip one song on the first time listening to it. i wish their newer cd was more like this one. favorite songs are undone, world to burn, and slowburn."
4,Surprisingly good,"I wasn't expecting much from this CD but had heard a song on my XM Radio station. In my opinion, the CD rocks just as well as more popular current day bands."
4,Phat Jungle Massive!!,"For all you junglists at there, you need to add this to tha collection. Mutant Sound System once again shows they can reprazent with the finest (JungleSky!). The first track, Fire, is one of the finest blazin' tracks i have heard in a long time. Remixed by the Urban Shakedown Bid (Mickey Finn and Aphrodite, albums you should pick up as well!), they set the wheelz of steel into overdrive. However, the other tracks lack in the jump up intensity as ""Fire"", but there is still a mighty serving of the dubplate special with plenty of dope ragga MCing on the side. If you like Jungle, you needz to get up on this action. Add this to your already growing M.S.S. collection."
4,Excellent characterizations!,"Thomas Hardy's family had a long history as players of instrumental music in the local church, and here Hardy creates an entertaining novel involving a fictional church choir.The characterizations and dialogue of his ""Mellstock Quire"" are detailed and interesting. The plot includes some very funny scenes--with the scene involving the visit to the vicar being among the best.You'll also find something in this book that you'll never see again--a Hardy novel with a (relatively) happy ending!"
4,Good family movie!!,"This is the type of movie that I would expect to find on The Hallmark Channel. It tests your faith, makes you want to cry and laugh all within 90 minutes. There are a lot of themes in the movie that play to the `normal' persons everyday life...too busy, not enough hours in the day, money troubles. It all fits. A good movie that allows you to realize that you need to reset your priorities!"
