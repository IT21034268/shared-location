2,CD not included,"I was disappointed to get this book without the CD-Rom that the book calls for. The description for the book does not indicate that CD-Rom is included (so I assumed it did not come with one). But the book calls for CD-Rom, thus it should be included, if it is in new condition. Explanations of abbreviations are in regular typing instead of bold or at least italic. I found myself re-reading paragraphs, as they were written in a confusing way."
1,"Guide to TCP/IP by Ed Tittel, Laura Chappell","I received the book and it was in average to poor condition (appeared damaged by water) and without the CD ROM, which should have accompanied this text book. Therefore, I cannot recommend purchasing anything from this seller.Regards,Michael"
3,Not what it looked like.,"When I purchased this book,and it was a hard bound book,I was under the impression that it would look like the picture that was used to promote the book. However, the book arrived in somewhat of a drab colored cover,obviously used, looking like an old ledger, the only I.D. was on the spine and it was in very old,dull,gold tpye; Leather braiding Grant."
4,I learned from this book,It is hard to find good leather work books. This one is very good for beginners and old timers as well. Some things were easy to understand and some took a little work.
4,Good read but needs work on the illustrations,This is one of those books for us custom leather workers that is a must. Having done leather work and fancy knot work for around 16 years I found this book full of ideas I could use. Most of the illustrations are fairly accurate (some definately need to be checked .....i.e. the Herringbond knot). Minus the flaws in the illustrations this book is a keeper.
2,Disappointing,"I found the book to be limited in scope. For example, there are no instructions for the braid illustrated on the cover. This particular braid doesn't appear any where in the book. I was looking for instructions for this specific braid pattern. The illustration on the cover prompted me to buy the book and I was, needless to say, disappointed. I could probably ""figure it out"" but I bought the book so I wouldn't have to.In another instance, the written instructions directly conflict with the visual illustration, one showing the opposite of what the other says. It took me a good hour to figure out the illustration was correct, not the written instructions.On the upside, there are a broad variety of beautiful braids available with (presumably) accurate and complete instructions. Overall: frustrating."
4,Leather Braiding,"Decent book for certain types of leather braiding. =)Got this for my husband and he really enjoyed it. He said it wasn't as complete as he hoped it would be, but otherwise it's ok."
5,Get the VERY BEST,"If you're a fern enthusiast, you cannot have a better consult book than this one. LOTS of valuable information (the chapters on propagation and cultivation are just wonderful) and color pics describing an impressive range of ferns, from tropical to temperate. I got this book since years, and I browse it every now and then... A MUST."
4,WARNING: DO NOT CONFUSE WITH NEW BAND!,"OK, I've found there's some confusion, as there's two different groups called ""Celtic Thunder,"" although I believe this group disbanded some time ago. The confusion has meant that this group's other CD, ""The Light of Other Days"" is getting a lot of one-star reviews by customers who bought it thinking it's by the new all-male pop-oriented band.THIS Celtic Thunder is a Baltimore-based rough-n-ready folksy traditional Irish group, with less slick production values but loads of soul and authenticity. The music ranges from jaunty dance tunes to reflective vocals, including the moving ""The Best Years of Our Lives,"" based on the songwriter's family story. This is the sort of music you enjoy with a pint at your local Irish pub, and have a good chat with the musicians later, not some slick overproduced group seen a mile away at a stadium. Sadly out of print, this CD deserves revival and rediscovery.If you're looking for traditional Irish folk, this is your CD."
4,The original band of this name,"I was looking at the channel guide a week ago and saw ""Celtic Thunder"" on the PBS schedule. I thought, ""Whuh?! Those guys are still together. How nice. Wonder where they've been?""Well, no, they're not still together, and as other reviewers have said, the PBS Celtic Thunder is totally unrelated. The latter group probably makes better use of the name, though, as they're big, loud, and flashy. This Celtic Thunder is much more restrained and, in my opinion, much more tasteful. They play straight-up, no B.S Irish music, and do it well.I would not rank them in the same league as the great Irish bands that started up in the 70s, say, Planxty, or The Bothy Band, or De Danann. But it's a solid effort, and ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is a gem, worth the price of the album by itself."
5,Hauntingly True Descriptions!,"I am learning to practise MBTI. After reading the rave reviews on Amazon, I decided to buy this book.I have to say the descriptions in the book of my wife's and my Type is hauntingly true.One of my classmates at the MBTI accreditation program who read her own Type description was also fascinated. She was hooked and could not put it down immediately when the training resumed."
4,Better than MBTI for Typing?,"I have her previous edition (Besides Ourselves) and I highly recommend it. For more mature people, or people whose innate type is obscured by lifes events, or anyone who tests borderline, I believe that people's highly stressed type is less affected by life's events. So if you get a stressed type correct, you can reverse it to get the normal type."
5,A+ (my grade in crim),"Thank you, Mr. Dressler. Not sure if it was you or if it was all of the studying that I didn't do for my other two classes. I'll never know, but I have to believe it was a little bit of both."
2,"It was ok, not really worth it","I didn't find that there were many good Crimlaw supplements, and this was among those that I tried. It's ok for reading for background material, but this would sort of be a ""I have all the time in the world so I'll read everything"" kind of supplement. Go with the E&E first, definitely, and basic law review articles may help after that."
4,So far so good!,This is a pretty good supplement thus far. It's easy to understand and well organized. It has been far more helpful than the text itself due to the way the material is organized. A pretty good value!
1,"I thought I was just crazy at first, but then it turned out I wasn't.","This book does not contain any discussion of robbery and burglary. For a comprehensive overview of criminal law, that is not good."
3,"Misleading ""Like New"" Label","This book was labeled ""like new"" but it appears to have been thoroughly used. I do not consider, and I do not think any other customer would consider, ""like new"" to mean a book that is heavily hi-lighted, marked, with tabbed corners and sticky notes left inside. ""Like new"" means not new but virtually unused. I am fine with the used copy, but I would maybe have paid half what I did. For law school books, it is important for me to be able to take my own notes by marking in a book. It is a big deal that I now have to look past some other person's work to get to the substance. Also, my markings will be harder to find. It's a big deal."
3,Okay Study Guide,"It is a good overall review, though not the best organization (lots of parts overlap unnecessarily), he really crams his own views down your throat the whole time (he is a big fan of retributive punishment). Oh, and he thinks that an advance from a homosexual man to a heterosexual man is an adequate defense for homicide (saying at most it is manslaughter), meaning he is kind of a bigot. So there's that. (I wish I hadn't bought the book, I'm not a huge fan of bigotry)"
3,Keyed to DRESSLER Casebook - Good treatise,"DRESSLER is heavy in political correctness and Model Penal Code and is also anti - Common Law tradition, and anti-anything to do with moral principles - hence the recurring theme of ""Legality"". However, if you can get past all that - & if you are using the DRESSLER Casebook - this treatise is keyed to it .. Also, His Audio lecture on CD-ROM is also keyed to the casebook. A nifty package that is throughly integrated. Tab the table of cases in the treatise & refer to it when doing case following hypo problems. ALSO, GET LaFave's Treatise / Hornbook - as a source for great exam prepping Hypos..Overall a very concise treatise in a small package."
2,Just a book of life experiences,"This is not a book of parables. It is not a book of stories that has many levels meanings like the parables in the Bible or the Aseop's Fables. This book is filled with common stories in everyday life and the author's reflections. That is all. All in all, the book's content does not match the title."
4,Zire 31-Nice little package,"We purchased this Zire 31 for our 12 year old son for his birthday. I have had previous Palm products before and have had fair success with them, but for the price, this one could not be beat. We had trouble loading the CD with all the software, but I have experienced this before with Palm products. If you have another Palm already loaded and no longer use that one, it is very difficult to delete and the second one will not load properly. It's almost like a virus. I solved this by getting the basic download from the website and the Palm is almost fully functional. Overall, he loves the features and it has exactly what he needs-nothing fancy, purely functional."
2,Very Portable but Very Noisy,"I was very excited about getting wireless headphones. I had looked at a number of vendors and models and selected this one. I was immediately disappointed. I don't know about all wireless headphones, but these have significant static noise at any distance. Also, I can only get about 20 feet away before the noise is so bad I can't hear the music anymore. I would suggest looking at other wireless headphones if you're looking for some."
5,This is awesome,I got these headphones and they really work. I can wear these headphones really comfortably and listen to anything I want without disturbing the rest of my family. THey work with TV's Computers and everything you can think of.
3,Dinofours-It's Time-Out Time,This book was about a dinosaur named Brendan who gets in trouble at school for not sharing and getting along with the other children. This book teaches that you need to get along with other people. The age level of this book is about from ages 4-6. I thought this book was good because it teaches an important lesson that all children need to learn.
5,Loved it!,This was a great video and a great workout. I normally drop workout programs after the first couple of times but I have been doing Cardio Karaticise for almost two months and don't intend to stop. I have already started feeling my arms and legs toning up and my endurance is greatly improving. The video is a lot of fun and with the instructional section it is really easy to follow. I also like the length of the workout. My whole body feels completely worked out and I like the time dedicated to my abs and thighs. I am really excited now to get home and start Karaticise. It is a great end to a stressful day at work. I strongly recommend it to anyone in any age group.
2,Severely repititious,"Yes, the quality is poor, but beyond that, the repetitiveness is maddening! The odd side step/arm twist exercises go on for eternity and don't seem very effective. The one positive is that the video is safe for your joints but it's not the best workout."
2,Don't waste your money on this boring video,"I'm shocked by the positive reviews of this workout. For one thing, the video itself seems very low quality. The music and background are both bad. Also, the background people are unprofessional. They look like they're going to crack up every time the camera's on them--plus they don't seem like they're even trying.I could overlook all that if the workout were good, but it's not. It's so BORING and not very challenging. For example, for about ten minutes all you do is right punch, left punch. I almost fell asleep on my feet. And there's another part with this weird arm choreography that is just so ineffective. It seems like it's just for show. This workout doesn't meet my definition of cardio at all."
5,Great Overview Book,This book is a great introduction and reference book for a beginner interested in combichem. The authors of the chapters are leaders in the field (many from industry-so the book has practical applications). The book has many examples right from recent literature which aids in understanding the concepts presented.
5,It's a filter...,"The filters do exactly as they are designed. Nothing special about them, they just do their job. I will buy more when I use these up."
2,"Ok Intro if you have never tried yoga, or tai chi, or qigong","This is a very nice looking video, really good production. But there is little theory here and you have to reverse the moves in your head. Consider this an appetizer toe-in-the-water course. What you get is a few moves, you do not get any complete form.If you really want to learn Tai Chi, and do not have a local instructor (or the time) and want a DVD go straight to the masters in Sunrise Tai Chi (YMAA) DVD (2005). YMAA stuff is always top notch."
3,"A good intro, but don't depend on it.","I've been wanting to learn Tai Chi for a while, but unfortunately, nobody offers classes near where I live. I received this as a gift, and I think it's a good intro. (I also received books and read copious amounts of information online.) You have to do the opposite of what you see on the screen, as the instructor is facing the student, and at the end of the tape when he combines everything, he goes pretty fast for my taste. I found I had an easier time learning moves from books than the dvd, but it was good for seeing how to connect moves together, which books have a hard time explaining."
2,Doesn't play in a computer'a DVD,I tryed to put it on my computer and didn't work. Since I dont habe a DVD player I would spected a warning about it.
1,Not worth reading by this author,"Very confusing. The Author does not write in chronological order. The first page starts off about the victim's dogs!! Then back and forth between the shooting and the trial. Nothing much about the backgrounds of the victim & the people involved in the case - just a few sentences. It's hard to keep up with who's who and how they know the victim and his wife who was convicted of having her husband murdered by her lesbian lover. I recommend that if you want to read about this case then buy ""She Wanted it all"" by Kathryn Casey - she is a great writer and gets to the point - not going on about dogs and the weather. I really don't know how Suzy Spencer got her book published - its just too disorganised."
1,Terrible Book,"I bought this book at the same time i got She Wanted It All by Kathryn Casey, both books are about the same crime. This one was so bad I couldn't finish it. I am an avid true crime reader and usually can plug my way through even the not so great ones, but this was just awful. It was hard to follow and the writing was so poor I just couldnt get into it at all. This is a fascinating case and I HIGHLY recommed the one by Kathryn Casey. It was one of the best true crime books I have ever read and a much better account of this case. Save yourself some money and skip this one..I dont even understand how it got published. This is the first time i have felt strongly enough to write a negative review but if I can save someone else from reading this utter trash heap of a book the time was well spent."
2,One of the worst true crime books I have ever read,"This book about the Steven Beard killing was very difficult to follow, and jumps around frequently so you are never sure if you are reading stuff that happened before the murder or after the murder. The pictures in the middle are interesting, and not in the far superior book on the case All She Wanted by Katherine Casey so that is why I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1."
1,The Fortune Hunter,"I also can't get past the first few chapters. This book sounds like the author's notes published in stream-of-consciousness. There's no real order to it. It doesn't appear to have been edited, either. If this were the first true-crime book I read, I'd never read another. My problem is that I didn't read the reviews first. This book is going in the trash."
2,Another fumble by Spencer,"As I write a review for the second true crime story that I have read by Suzy Spencer, I have mixed feelings about doing it. First, I swore that I would never read anything from Ms. Spencer again after wading through WAGES OF SIN (anyone who has read that book knows what I'm trying to say --- the step-by-step, pedantic details of the crime were retold three different times!). Second, I hate to criticize someone's attempts at a livelihood. With that being said, the crime story itself is interesting, the research seems to have been done adequately, but Ms. Spencer just doesn't have any skills at writing in this genre. I have an entire bookshelf full of true crime novels, and I've forgotten many of the details of the various crimes, but it's very difficult to forget Ms. Spencer's poor writing. I would suggest that you find another author, perhaps one who has written an account of this very crime, and compare the two. You'll see what I mean."
2,Not worth the time I invested in it.,"This book was such a chore to try to read, I barely finished it. The writer bounced from one thing to the next, and I could never figure out where she was going or why. Plus, most of the book is comprised of boring court scenes that read like they came right out of the transcript. The language is at times colorful, but that's the only thing worthwhile about this book. The descriptions of people stung me as downright mean. It got slightly better the farther I got into it, but not enough to salvage the read for me. I wouldn't suggest any friend of mine read this book."
2,Very poor writing,"The story can be somewhat compelling and interesting to follow but the writing is very poor. I can't believe Suzy Spencer got this book published. There must be a shortage of true crime writers because the writing is unbelievably bad. Information is thrown at you from no where -- sudden references where there was no introduction -- you have to use your imagination and piece it together. For example when she writes about Cole, Celeste's husband after Steve dies. She writes that Cole is a construction worker by day and a bartender by night at the 311 club. Three pages later she writes ""the unemployed Cole."" When and how did Cole become unemployed? This is just thrown out there...he goes from a guy with two jobs to being unemployed. Bad writing."
4,Page Turner,"I am a huge true crime fan and have read all but one of Spencer's books, she does some of her best writing here in this compelling, and sort of crazy story. Not only is this book a page turner, but you get something with a Suzy Spencer book you don't get with most true crime books; accuracy. Cleary she has spent a good amount of time with most involved in this crime, she gains the trust of the people she writes about and reports fairly and honestly, and God lover, she doesn't exploit. I like that. Another winner from Suzy Spencer one of the best true crime writers working today."
2,Not good,"I wrote a review earlier and gave this book one star. Then I thought it over and figured that might be a little harsh. I do like to be fair. So, I deleted the review now I'm giving it two. The reason, the editor must have some blame in this book. I can't unload it all on the writer. It's a jumble, and I found it difficult to read. I didn't finish it. Got to a certain point, and it just didn't seem worth it. So there it is, my thoughts, and I'm standing by them."
2,Thumbs down,"This book reads like a trashy novel. The smut factor is high, and it seemed that Spencer attempted to dehumanize every person involved in this story, including Steve Beard, the murder victim. In addition, her writing was disorganized and incredibly difficult to follow."
4,Pretty Good!,"I watched this Trial on Court TV.My True crime reading group picked this book because of all of The drama going on in the case..Lesbian lover shoots Husband..Daughters turn against mother..This book started off badly for me,it jumped around too much but I kept reading and it leveled out..I ended up enjoying the book alot.Its a Shocking case.For anyone who hasnt heard of it I recommend it highly!"
5,Perfect,"The book is brand new, clean and crisp, and arrived exactly when it was scheduled to arrive. I would definitely buy from this seller again!"
5,"Balanced, well supported, and analytical","It is the first book I read in Portuguese, hence I lost many things. However, despite that handicap I enjoyed it a lot. It covers about 500 years of history in just around than 300 pages. It gives information, facts and analysis at the same time. It does not focus just on the political side, as many historians do; it also tackles economic issues. In the last chapter the title states from 1964 to 1984; however, it really covers a bit more. I hope the author may present a revised edition to cover the Cardoso's and Lula's periods."
3,"Aesthetically appealing and convenient, but not very durable","I've had mine for 3 years (from Niagara Cycle via Amazon). I keep my bike in the garage, so it's fairly sheltered from Southern California elements. However, I was bummed today when my basket gave way when I pushed my backpack into it a little too firmly. The mesh just literally broke, as if it was severely rusted under the paint (you can see a little rust, but not much). A whole section of the basket broke, so I need to replace it. Bummer. Aesthetically, it's perfect, so I'll probably get another one; but I expected better durability. I'll check with my bike shop to see if I can find something compatible with the mounting system."
3,"Okay, but not great","The games graphics are pretty good, but there is almost no use of the touch screen exept building weapons. Sometimes its also a little frustrating. But the transit system feature is very fun."
1,A very cool Christmas,This movie is evidently for someone under 15 years of age. Stupid stuff. Not worth the money. Not worth the time to watch it. I didn't know we needed a new twist on Christmas as per the other reviewer!
2,Not good not good at all,This movie lacks imagination the Santa is horrible. My kids thought this movie was boring and I lost them during family night to sponge bob. Save your money and time.
2,A Very Cool Christmas -- Nice Change,"I enjoyed this new take on the traditional Santa Claus tales. George Hamilton was a refreshing, familiar face to see in this updated version of teaching the Christmas Spirit to today's youth."
3,Spartan Women bored me,"This book lacks insight because there is a lack of sources on the topic so it is a lot of guesswork and questionable inferences which bothered me. It also seemed like she generally puts Spartan women on a pedestal and even skews facts at points to make them seem much better than Athenian women. She refused to call having a shared wife wife-sharing, but rather she calls it husband-doubling and techniques like that annoyed me. Overall, I found her technique and writing style lacking."
4,Funny French Film!,"I don't speak French that well and I had to read the subtitles to understand the dialogue. Even though I did, I thought the film was funny.Its a story of a gangster called Jawad who was one day driving with a school teacher to show him the way to his destination, only for them to have an accident and the teacher had to enter the hospital. Jawad wears his clothes and goes to the school where he teaches claiming he is the teacher ""Despalain"" in hopes of making some etra money. The school assigns him a class full of dumb and naughty students whom he has to deal with. While dealing with these students, he starts changing himself from being a street gangster into an intellectual.Somehow like Gangsters' Paradise, only funny."
4,A new way of looking at cultures,"This book explains cultural selection theory in a very straightforward and concise way that bridges the gap between biology and sociology. It starts with an interesting historical chapter which traces primitive versions of cultural selection theory all the way back to Darwin. Next comes a very comprehensive overview of selection mechanisms and an explanation of the new so-called r/k theory. The rest of the book is filled with an impressive tour through the possible applications of the author's theory to political history, religion, art, mass media, sexual behavior, sport, and many other areas of cultural history. The author obviously has insight in many different sciences. I would have liked a more convincing proof of the new cultural r/k theory. Otherwise the book is quite well-documented."
2,obscure pop rock band from the late 80s,"So odd when a band like this is in print while so many sought after artists of the era have yet to see the light of day on CD. I blindly bought this thinking perhaps it was a collection by the band ""Modern Man"" from early 1980, who were produced by Ultravox singer Midge Ure. That is not the case. I guess this band could be called synthpop, but they're more like pop rock from the late 80s. The lead singer sounds like Richard Marx, the music is comparable to Cutting Crew, Johnny Hates Jazz, and other light pop bands of that style from the late 80s. The music is really not very memorable, and not even one track stands out as strong single material, which would explain why this was never heard on commercial radio.Even the album cover is deceiving. A two man duo with the name ""modern man"". Immediately you're going to think 'new wave synth band!' Unfortunately, that's not the case."
5,The Best,"This wax is very high quality. It keeps your instrument looking great and in great shape. I don't know if there are many others out there, but this is the only one i will ever use."
4,Language is the key,"What I like about Bottero's work, this included, is his emphasis on the actual words of the ancient writers. My dissertation involves the literary influence of these ancient texts on biblical texts, but since I, as a math and English major, have not yet had the opportunity to take courses in ancient Sumerian or Akkadian, it means a great deal to me to have some basis on which to tell how good are the translations offered for such texts, and hence how good my intended comparisons. His emphasis on reason and on ""religion/gods"" adds further to understanding and recovering the ancient near eastern milieu of thought which was lost to us during the Hellenization process begun by Alexander the Great. To regain these pre-Platonic thought patterns is very difficult for us, but possible when offered, as here, material that emphasizes the very words used by the ancients."
1,Poor Performance. Rust Quickly. Buyer Beware.,"I realize these are cheap, but be aware that you get what you pay for. I think the other reviewers are reviewing them immediately after they open the box and use them once. The first time I used them they worked ok. Washed them once (hand washed, luke-warm water, hand dried) and they began to rust immediately. Second use was less than adequate. It is now a few months later and I have to throw them out and buy another set. Save yourself the headache and pay a little more money and buy a better set."
4,Good deal for the sale price,"I just got this set -- and am pleased, so far. They are nice and sharp, have a decent weight and are well balanced. The $100 ""list price"" is absurd, but the sale price is great. While the knives are all present, there is an extra slot in the block. This bugs me a bit, as it always looks like something's missing, even though it isn't."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!,I can't even tell you what the quality of the knifes is because I had to return them TWICE. Both sets I received were missing the exact same knife. I experienced the same problem with another Sabatier set I ordered at teh same time. Save yourself the frustration and pay a few extra bucks elsewhere!
5,Snap Like Twigs???,"Sorry, but I agree with another reviewer when they said you have to be doing something very wrong to have these knives ""snap like a twig."" True they are thinner than a $1000 set, but they are wonderful for use in a home. I have had them for 4 or 5 months and haven't even had to sharpen them yet. Granted I don't try to chop wood with them, so they haven't snapped them like twigs, but I cook 5 nights out of the week and use them just about every time. Great knives, great price, DO NOT snap like twigs!!! Great Buy!"
2,Stainless is not supposed to rust,"I realize these knives were cheap, but I didn't expect them to start rusting in less than three months. Yet, that's what they're doing. I see them headed to the garbage. The kinfe block is useful though."
3,Good tips,The book offers good tips with great pictures for better visuals. There are also charts and diagrams in it to better understand the text.
3,OK resource,"This book has some definite plusses. It is an easy read, and I would imagine that it makes any parent struggling to deal with ODD feel less alone.What I didn't like about the book was that there were not very many practical ideas or solutions. The author painstakingly describes year after miserable year with her son and goes into excruciating detail about interventions that showed promise but didn't work. Then suddenly in the end of the book the problems seem to just clear up.I work with kids who have ODD in my job at a school. While this book did provide me with more sympathy for the parents I work with, I didn't feel it gave me any direction or new ideas for my work. Instead it made me feel rather hopeless and helpless. If you are going to read this book, I would definitely reccommend reading a more practical book along with it. I found The Explosive Child very helpful."
2,practical strategies needed,"Although you can certainly feel this Mom's pain there are very few practical strategies listed for dealing with ODD either at home or in the educational setting. I was extremely disappointed in this book for those reasons. She stated she had a wonderful family, doctors, teachers but very little on what they actually did."
5,Wonderful DVD,This DVD is wondeful. The paintings are beautiful. They look oh so brilliant on my flat screen tv. The DVD and its contents are even more than I imagined they would be. Anyone interested in the Impressionists would be so happy to own this DVD.
4,Awesome,"This made for a very nice and classy background while I had a dinner party. Many people gravitated towards it, and I overheard some nice comments. Only use this for your more sophisticated friends though, the hillbilly side of my family showed up and tried to change the channel..."
2,Low Resolution is Disappointing,"I give them credit for the compilation of the art and the variety of presentations, but I expected better quality images. The ""high resolution"" wallpaper versions are 1024 x 768, which include a large border with the ""Ambient Art"" title overlapping the many of the images. The actual image is roughly 800 x 500 depending on the painting."
1,DVD Inoperable on BluRay and Computer DVD,"It seems that technology has left this DVD by the wayside, since it fails to play on my Samsung BluRay or on either of my computer's DVD players. Prior to this DVD I have had no problems with viewing new or old DVDs or BluRay discs. The problem may be in format used on the DVD. Beware."
5,Very Good Book and characters,"I really enjoyed this sequal to the first book, Turn Back the time. I could hardly put it down. This is a very well written story that goes from one interesting situation to another as it follows the life of Hattie and Smith and their family and extended family. There has been much talk about the 3rd book of the sequel and it not being written or made available to the public. What a dissapointment!!!! The fans of this family deserve to have a conclusion to this story. If I could give it more stars I would. In any event if you haven't read these two books; your missing a really good saga."
5,shadow & sunshine,"I could not put this book down! It is a sequel to TURN BACK TIME, where we are introduced to Hattie and Smith Delaney. Shadow and Sunshine is very well written. I recommend it highly."
5,A page turner,"Really enjoyed this series. Hard to put it down. Anxious to read the last one in the series, but so far can't find it."
1,broke second day,"This clip came with the case that I bought for my Palm Treo phone. The second day that I had the case I lightly bumped against a doorway and the clip came apart and all of the pieces went everywhere and it wasn't able to be fixed. I am unhappy about the clip mainly because when it broke my phone his the cement and chipped the corner. I would not buy this clip of you are going to be doing anything but sitting around at a desk. I don't know if it was just my clip, or if all of them are made poorly."
1,Flimsy plastic,This only lasted a week before the plastic piece that attaches to the holster broke and the holster ended up on the pavement. This really needs to be steel.
3,Acceptable quality,"Although this clip is weel manufactured, the way the clip snaps into the phone's case reduce its durability, specially during side motion stress (i.e when you get into your car seat)."
2,"Starts with a bang, then falls apart",This book started out with a good plot premise but it quickly fell apart. Too much of the underpinnings of the story were left unexplained or glossed over. Also this book includes just about every cliche I've ever read in a mystery. And some of the gore is simply overkill. A disappointing book.
4,not enough clues to follow,"if u r looking for a book that you can play detective while reading, i don't think this is the book u r looking for. you'll never be able to figure out who was behind it all. it had a great mix of book styles. it contained scince fiction, but yet you could still believe it happening in real life. it wasn't completely off the wall. it also contained that intriguing political corruption element that i luv. all this and they still put in romance, but don't get your hopes up...... the dialogues though was weak. when Jenna and her mother or father chatted, the convo didn't seem real life. the most exciting parts r in the autopsy room. you'll be amazed at the detail in there that churns your stomach. once, the mystery starts unfolding, i swear, u can't put it down. it just continues to lead u on and on and on. u will honestly not be able to blink when u read the two chase scenes either. buy it and read. you'll enjoy."
5,Unique and utterly captivating!!,"This suspenseful masterpiece thrilled me from page one!! The entirely real characters set in a fascinating, all-too-possible plot create a novel in which the very evil never imagined possible is breathtakingly presented. Fast-paced and thought-provoking, this one-of-a-kind novel transports its reader to a world where anything can happen to the most innocent of citizens...and where one wrong move could change - or even end - a life forever."
2,"good intro and body, lame conclusion","I liked this book until I came to the last two or three chapters. It left so much unresolved, which I hate in a book. It didn't explain how the larva got into the brain without the victims noticing. It didn't explain why the larva made them crazy. It didn't explain anything. If I wanted a book without a conclusion, I would defitnely choose this one!"
4,A good read well told,"I am biased - I went to college with Christopher Golden and part of my enjoyment was due to the recognition of some of the physical elements of the school that made it into the book, but honestly that was only part of it. The story is believable and interesting. As a science buff (not a doctor don't even play one on teevee) I found the descriptions of biological elements credible and well presented. There was not one moment of ""OH COME ON!"" throughout the book for me and it was greatly entertaining.If you are looking for an atypical but fun to read thriller, this is a book you should check out.Doug Williams"
1,Don't waste your money,"This thing looks like it was shot with a camcorder and the narration is boring and difficult to understand. Spain does have some wonderful examples of Roman architecture, but the shots are so poor I can't recommend this to anyone. Definitely not worth $29.95."
5,season 10 at last!!!!!!,"Just received my copy of the final season, it was never aired in the UK hope it is great. Why is it not being released in the US at the same time usually it is the UK that has to wait ?"
4,Love it!!!,If you love a good romantic drama then Beverly Hills 90210 is for you...I grew up watching these when I was a kid.
2,Horrendous,"I'm a big fan of the original 90210, but come on. The second Brandon left the show, it was over.Seasons 9 & 10 were dreadful. Painful to watch. And the last straw was bringing Dylan's fatherback. So I guess Toni died for nothing..."
4,"Memories of ""Rare Air""","We first encounterd Rare Air at Stokesay Castle in Reading,Pa. and were blown away. This was sometime in the 80's and we've been searching for them ever since. Brings back memories of a warm summer night, fantastic music shared with our family. Sharing the CDs with our son and his new bride."
3,When Good Madlibs Go Bad,"This book reads like a bunch of used Madlib books stapled together. I think someone was hitting the old cannibis supply just a LITTLE too hard when they sat down at the keyboard to write this tale. Come to think of it, maybe that's what was lacking when I began turning the pages. If you ARE afraid of voodoo pins, I suggest you consult your local drug dealer PRIOR to purchasing this little jem."
4,More action than horror,"If you were expecting a horror game when you saw this you were mistaken. This game has a horror theme but nothing about it is scary. Most of this game is just traveling around the island, fighting monsters, and trying to solve puzzles. There are quite a few cool weapons and some of the boss battles are just plain awesome. The game also has some bloody moments but overall nothing really bad. The graphics are pretty good but the joints of the people don't quite fit together right. When the people speak their words don't match up with their mouths moving. Some of the weapons are pretty much useless and some of the camera angles are bad.With all that being said it is still a good game and very enjoyable. It isn't too horribly long, if you are a good gamer you should be able to beat it in 10 hours or less, but it is quite a ride."
3,Ok game,"Its an O.K. game. Thats prolly all you can say about it. The graphics are nice, the story is good, and some of the gameplay is really fun, But what ruins it is its really bad voice acting and syncing of the lips (think old Godzilla movies) and the control is really bad and makes it hard to play, but a fairly good game and average title, try b4 you buy"
1,"Definately a ""console"" game only.","I bought the Dreamcast mainly because of its graphics and the tremendous potential for the sports titles that will come out. For all other types of games, I usually stick with the computer titles. BUT for some reason, I bought this game. Terrible. Level design makes no sense, if you leave a room after killing a monster and return, the monster is alive, the cut scenes are choppy, many times you get knocked back into a previous area and have to battle through it all over again. Even the animation of the characters are horrible. TERRIBLE GAME."
4,Not Bad Not Great,"I bought this game at Wal-Mart when I got my Dreamcast..I must say that the game is more then I expected,but wasn't as great as I hoped.The graffics were awsome and so was the sound track,but the camerasometimes makes it hard to see infront of you.Also the game play was very short I only played it for two days and beat it..Well I leave it up to you...I would rent first and then decide"
2,Despite the graphics boredom sets in after 10 minutes,The best thing about this game is that it has gorgeous graphics. Other than that there isn't a whole lot that is great with this game. Instead of being fun it gets boring and tedious. The weapons are cool though but that isn't enough to save this game. The concept of 2 people able to switch on the fly was cool but there isn't really a huge need for it. You could get through the whole game using Eliot and not touch Dogs once. The most tedious thing about the game is the way the characters run/limp. In the beginning of the game when a Eliot/Dogs has very little max life and they get hurt they will start limping. My god a turtle could run faster then they do. Even when Eliot and Dogs have max life a turtle could probably still run faster then they do. At most a weekend rental will do you good for this game.
3,Blue Stinger: Full Review,"Blue Stinger is the type of game that most people would appreciate if it had been worked on a little more. Unfortunatlly the game isn't as good as expected. The graphics are up to par, but the story is a little iffy here and there. The voice- over for the game is terrible and some foul language is involved. There is a lot of blood, if that's the type of game your looking for, and some parts can be rather eerie, but in my opinion, it doesn't match up to the survival horror genre like Resident Evil.Gameplay is somewhat difficult as your character doesn't respond that well to the controls, and you can't make the character run or walk. He stays at a slow pace jog which can be frustrating at times. However, another plus for the game is the great weapon designs; but overall this game is only worth getting if you have all of the Resident Evil games and you still want something new to play."
1,... More like BlueSTINKER,"This game just plain s****. Like all Resident Evil games and it's ilk. Your characters moonwalk around the levels trying to kill the baddies. Control is terrible, you can't quite do exactly what you want to do when you want to. Graphics are good, about the 50th percentile. Camera angles are the worst and hardest enemy in the game, you are constantly fighting them. Mouths move out of sync with words during the FMV sequences, like a bad Bruce Lee movie... You will laugh and you will cry, all because you made the mistake of shelling out $$$ on this.SegaCide"
1,Don't get stung!,"I hated this game. I quickly tired of the repetative fights, having to return again and again to a location, the annoying camera angles, and the terrible animation. This game is the best example of what not to do with a surrvival horror game. Go buy RE:Code Veronica."
2,Blue Stinger,"Ok this game when i saw the pro's and con's on Amazon.com i thought i would be bad but when i got it, it was sorta odd. The people look like have have a plug up their [butt] when they run. And when u got into town the music was [stupid] as [heck] for the love of god, they could have played some decent music, the weapons were bad but it was stupid because there was a naked fairy which followed you around and it was also stupid becuase they like copied Resident Evil and Dino Crisis but they could have dont a little bit better, i mean damn this game was [stupid] i mean it wasn't even close to Resident Evil or anything and the monsters looked like a Zombie and a Dinosaur mixed. So buy this at your own risk..."
5,Really good and adictave game,"O.k. so the game has its weak points,but it is somthing to keep you busy. It only takes about ten minuets to get used to the control of it. It is also one of the games that you have to play about 15 minuets to get into. once your into it you'll never stop playing it."
4,I enjoyed playing this game.,I would recommend this one. The plot kept me interested through out the entire game. It's set up like a mystery/sci-fi novel. You have to solve puzzles or clues before you can move on. When you finish it you feel quite satisfied. I gave it four stars because I hear that the Dreamcast is capable of better graphics. It took me around 20 hours to complete and I recommend this title to all those who enjoy action/adventure games.
3,its good for a first generation game,"this game is pretty descent for a first generation adventure title the graphics are really good controls good and its a little longer than most games in this style which is a plus but on the downside sometimes the camera angles arent where the action is,the story is corny,the lip synching is atrocius but overall its got more good than bad its a descent adventure with lots of action"
1,it has bug's look out !,I got this game only to find out it has bug's thay say it is only in 1 or 2 game but i know it is more like 1 out of 5. so if you got a good copy your lucky or you are out of luck.
5,Resident Evil for Dreamcast,"Now whether or not you will enjoy this game depends probably on how much you enjoy Resident Evil. Blue Stinger is very similar to Resident Evil, which is why i like it. The weapons are awesome, the graphics are great, and it makes you think. I haven't completed the game yet, but when I rented it I spent about 6 straight hours playing it. So it does take a while to beat, which is a very good thing. Many people complain about the fact that the characters mouths are out of sync with the sound. WHO CARES! If thats what you are really looking for in a game, then you got problems. But on occasion the camera angles do mess up like when you are in a corner or something. Then you may not be able to see your enemies or it may spin and get you feelin quite queasy. All in all, this game rox."
1,The Critics Were Right This Time,"This time, I have to say, ""I wish I would have listened to the cridics."" This game was totally overrated by the pros. I expected a fun game, with lots of action. But, I found it was hard for me to interact with the game because of the (not so good) control concept. Example: when using the look key ""L"", as soon as you release the ""D"" butten, the view springs back to the direction your facing. Which can seem like a ""Tug of War"" match (against the computer) when your trying to zero in on something you're not directly facing.And I'm sorry, but the characters are dorky looking and that really has alot to do with taking the game serious. It has a strong plot and you've gotta be this goofy looking guy who can't even jump.If it had controls like the ""Tomb Raider"" games and a plot more like the ""Mario"" or ""Zelda"" games, or mabye even ""Double Dragon"", I'd have given it 4-stars."
2,This game is good for about 30 min,I played this game and got really frustraded with it quite a bit the graphics are cartoon like and nowhere near resident evil I didnt like it very much not enough clues at times you don't know what to do next. I don't think it lives up to dreamcasts cabability. Replay value none.
1,This game is a cheap attempt to the Resident evil series,"Some people are saying ""if you like Resident evil you will like this game"" But ill tell all of you it is not true. For example, I love the RE series and i own every single one of them but i still think this game sux. For a game that is suppose to have 128bits, this games graphics are really horriblly done and give dreamcast a bad name. The controls in the game are just impossible. It can be a good game if they improved the graphics and the controls of the game. The characters you get to play walk and run around the place like they have a wedgy or something. The weapons in the game are kinda cool but no where near the RE series. This games puzzles are ok but sometimes you just dont have enogh clues and you just frustrated out of your mind about what to do next. Well if you considering to buy this game take it from me dont get it, i guarrentee that you will be happier buying another game."
2,ouch this game is a bust,the only reason i gave this game a 2 is for graphics.there are some problems like he pulls a bazooka out of nowhere it just pops up.And the bosses....please a crab with a car as a shell
1,Quite possibly the worst game ever.,"I was completely and utterly disappointed with this game. It's basically a Resident Evil Clone with Broadway-esque music trying to set ""the Mood"". Horrendous acting and atrociously animated characters. I thought the dreamcast was supposed to ""revolutionize gaming for the new millenium"". Well,I can't expect everything to be good. Resident Evil on the beach. I wonder who thought that up?"
4,Very good documentary w/ poor narration.,"This series I found well done as to the history and the filming, but the narrator's rather stilted pronunciation of English with his hard Ts [ - Bri-Tish, bat-Tle] to be more than a little distracting. After a bit it became annoying. Find it hard to believe the director accepted this as the norm."
3,JLo's Lola,"I love the game. But it is not in very good shape at all. I wanted to give it as a Christmas present, but I can't. The corners of the board are bent and the box is not in very good shape at all. I'm really disappointed. This was one of my favorite games as a kid and I wanted to give it to my children to experience it too. Bummer it won't be a Christmas gift, but we'll still get to play it."
4,Lots of Fun,"A nice not-too-scary adventure with students heroes solving the puzzle, very impowering for young people. My daughter loves them and as a teacher I recommend this series for my students."
4,Would you want to have five letters a day?,"I liked the book a little. This book is in a series. There are threemain charicters. There names are Dink, Josh,and Ruth Rose.Josh and Ruth Rose and brother and sister.Have you ever got five letters and one of them are emty.Well Josh got five letters and one of them are emty."
3,Book review,Most of the comparison is between Christian faiths. I was hoping to see more on some of the other world religions in comparison.
5,"Easy to read and understand,",This book covers the beginnings of the 4 Gospels and enlightens us in easy to understand terms the probable intent of each author with his opening of his gospel. I really enjoyed it and gave me new food for thought in my study.
5,Chilling! Gripping! Great!,"A very well done production that takes a much more solid approach to ""The End Times"" than anything else out there! The 7 Signs, and the way they take you through them are truly facinating. It does have Christian overtones, but if you watch closely, the film speaks to all religions as it builds its theories on the end of the world.Nicely directed by Mr. Kaminski! And the production value is great also. Cool graphics, and illustrations to support the narration! The interveiws were also very interesting."
3,Haven't seen it constructed yet,"My son is a Lego fanatic, he builds every set that he gets within a few short hours. I purchased this with hopes of keeping his busy for awhile (not to mention his fascination with the Eiffel Tower), but it has yet to be built. Maybe one day..."
1,The Eiffel tower is not made of bricks,"Wow... that's awful. It looks like an early web graphic with the jaggies. Fundamentally, you cannot acheive what Eiffel did with his tower in masonry (which are the conceptual basis of Lego 'bricks'). That's the entire point of the tower, and industrial era architecture. It's a no-brainer.If ever a project was determined to be developed in Lego's Technic system it's this tower. Technic's girder-like pieces would be perfect for reproducing the tower's members, at actual angles. But Lego can't seem to get past the concept that the Technic system is only to be used for vehicles, not buildings. This doesn't even get the color right (It's brown). I would pay this hefty pricetag for a Technics version of the Eiffel. But this? The designers who developed this kit are kidding themselves if they think the towers diagonal lines can be executed in junky analog version, patched together from orthogonal shapes, and retain any of the tower's grace or meaning."
3,catzilla!!!!!,My 12 year old grandson and my 7 year old grandson finished the Eiffel Tower in half a month but their cat destroyed it in a quick 5 seconds. Their cat lost 5 lives and my grandsons are now having to start it over. The cat is not allowed in the room anymore.My suggestion is to keep all wild and psycho animals away.
5,Challenge but Fun,My son (age 12) and I assembled this item together during the Christmas. It was challenge but fun. We helped each other to find the pieces and read the instruction. It took us four days to finish it (2 - 3 hours per day). I wish I can upload the finished tower on the website for you to see.
5,16+ no kidding,"Very high in detail and exceptional structural design. The durability is very good consider it's a plastic brick toy. Some reviewer compliant about is not durable after done building it, I don't agree. If you are a seasoned LEGO builder and know where to push or hold when you put together pieces so they would stick together very tight, I would say this LEGO Eiffel Tower is very sturdy. I have tested by dropped it from the table height and of course the tower break but only those little pieces (like the flag, the radio pole, and the little decorate vertical brick) the core structure still hold pretty good.After finishing this piece make me want to buy LEGO Taj Mahal (wait for the price drop).PS: It isn't kidding about ""age 16+"" on the box, building this set require lots of effort and patience (took me 14 hour to complete it)."
3,Comprehensive but a little dated,"This is a very useful overview of the very broad subject of bioinformatics, and it provides a good background on a variety of approaches to topics like protein conformation prediction. The translation is excellent - the subject-matter is clear and there are no obvious errors, which is unusual for such a technical subject. The main drawback of the book is that, because this is a field in which progress is being made rapidly, the book is already out of date in places. For example, in the chapter dealing with protein structure prediction, there is scant mention of the most successful approach to date, namely the Rosetta project initiated at the University of Washington in Seattle.Nevertheless, this is a very useful primer for people coming into the area of bioinformatics and it covers topics that will not age as rapidly, such as certain statistical models. Indeed, the author's exposition of how Hidden Markov Models work is as clear as anything I've read anywhere."
5,Just The Best!,"Just picked up this wonderful disc.It's a feast for sore ears.Two magnificent tenor men, Gene Ludwig on B3 (bass), MelvinSparks - guitar, Kenny Washington - drums. No string bass ofany type - shucks. And the other half of the genius isdelivered by Rudy Van Gelder - who - oh, man - can't evenbegin to describe his greatness. If he recorded it - it's atleast half good. The mountain came to Mohammed because, asusual - the musicians wound up in Englewood, NJ - formerlyMonk's Hackensack, to record where Rudy Van Gelder has beenruling for many years.If you can hear ""Serenade In Blue"" from this disc and notget chills, you're just not warm enough. ""Cry Me A River""will dehydrate you. Beautiful playing, arranging and unrealrecording.Thank you, guys."
3,Real enjoyable,"It' not always easy to find a ""swinging"" Sax/Organ Combo anymore.This one certainly fits the bill.I didn't realize Plas Johnson was still around."
1,Don't Waste Your Money Continual Leaks,"What a waste of money! I returned the first aerobed because of continual holes and leaks popping up in the coil areas and it is and ongoing problem with this newer one. I called the aerobed help number and they told me that my 30 days were up and would not refund or at least exchange it for a ""3rd"" bed. Actually they were quick to note that this model number was no longer covered by warranty anyway. Hmmmm...how convienient for them. All my patches are gone and today I am headed to K-Mart or who knows where to hopefully find some more patches that will hopefully work. I'd rate it a 0 if I could!"
1,BAD PRODUCT,"I bought this bed about 10 months ago, and I was able to use it for about 6 months before the glue that binds the surfaces of the bed started to come apart, which means there is now a giant bubble in the middle of the bed, making it uncomfortable and unusable. I hope they find a way to fix this because it otherwise is a great product, but for now I'm stuck with a lousy bed."
2,A step in the right direction,"Oxfordians will thank Penny McCarthy for her many original insights and analyses in this excellent book. Unfortunately these virtues are not matched by her logic or deduction abilities from the evidence which she herself presents, which wd lead her to reject William Shakespeare as the authorA fuller review will be found on deveresociety.co.uk reviews"
5,A 8 year old child's review on Wuffy the Wonder Dog,"I got Wuffy the Wonder Dog and Too Many Dogs last year for Christmas 2009.Now its May 29,2010 and last night I just started reading it and I finished the whole thing!I thought Wuffy the Wonder Dog should have 10,000,000 stars! It's my most favoirite chapter book i've ever read in my whole life! I think every petlover friend should read this book. And have your best friend and friends read this book. It's about a dog and a cat that are very good friends but Wuffy is very into his life and is always getting himself into trouble with his tail. He's also always writing songs and sharing them with the cat Elizabeth. I think Wuffy is the best dog ever. Beside my dog Rosebud."
4,Great selection,"This is a great selection of albums if you love modal jazz from the 60s period, which may have been the pinnacle period in jazz in my opinion ( even though I wasn't around at the time).Wayne Shorter was earning his stripes along with Herbie Hancock back then, and these albums are a great addition to any collection from that period, and sit nicely alongside Miles Davis'sKind of Blue; John Coltrane'sBlue Train]; and Herbie Hancock's'[[ASIN:B00000IL29 Maiden Voyage.Wayne Shorter actually was part of Miles Davis's outfit at the time, and went on to form the experimental fusion jazz outfit 'Weather Report' in the 1970s, but these albums serve as testimony that he was a force in jazz before his work in Fusion, and this is the jazz sound that he has revisited in recent years.I recommend this box set to jazz collectors and beginners alike, it certainly won't disaapoint!"
5,works great on my Avaya digital phone,"I have an office phone (Avaya 4625SW IP) that I needed to be able to record phone conversations on and this unit works great. I actually have a plantronics headset and ""vista"" amp, so instead of being connected on the handset, I have it on the headset output.I don't have it connected directly into the soundcard, instead I have a small submixer (Behringer XENYX 1002FX) that I use to select multiple input sources into a professional sound card (RME Hammerfall). But it should work fine with a regular sound card too."
3,good book,Needed for school. Did not use it too much though. Overall expensive like all the books these day. Book is Ok
4,Very pleased,Having read the 2 previous editions this is what I expected. It may be a bit too adnced for first year MLS students. I wanted even more details.
1,Use this book as a doorstop,"This book is not for the beginer in blood banking. It is disjointed, confusing, difficult to comprehend, and does not flow in a logical manner. It was written by several authors, including Harmening. This probably accounts for the confusing flow. May be helpful to experienced blood bankers, but if you are a begining student trying to fathom the many intricacies of blood banking, this book will make you want to tear your hair out. Without a doubt, the worst text book I have ever read and I have a master's degreee and 1.5 years toward my PhD. Avoid this book like the plague unless you have prior knowledge or experience. It will turn you off blood banking forever. I give it a D for effort (a poor and poorly edited effort)."
3,Really depends on the level you are on.,"This was my textbook for Immunohematology in my MLT program. I found it extremely overwhelming. It is very very good at the details but completely skips the basics. If you have no experience with blood bank principles or techniques, I would suggest a more rudimentary book to get you started."
2,Not for Undergraduate Students,"Comprehensive coverage of blood banking and transfusion medicine. The appropriate audience is SBB students, medical students, pathology fellows and seasoned bench technologists in blood banking. The book is NOT geared toward the needs of undergraduate MLT and MT students due to the heavy details and complex text. Although the chapters are divided into basic and advanced sections,the students find the textbook difficult to follow. The number and variety of contributers impacts the cohesiveness of the chapters and the overall flow of the text. The book has nice color plates."
1,you'll tear up your Zire,It's almost impossible to replace a Zire battery yourself. Go on the internet and do some searches on battery replacement for Zire and you'll see the problems. I got mine in after a number of scratches to the case. The battery doesn't seem to hold nearly the charge as the original one.
2,"right filter, wrong plug and voltage","Having purchased similar items in the past, I thought that I knew exactly what I wanted. When I found the item on Amazon, I was quite happy until it showed up at our door. I took it out of the box only to find out that the unit had a 220V, 2-pin rounded (European) plug. Nowhere in the online ads could I find this detail. I just looked again and still cannot find this in their ads. When I complained to Amazon and ANTonline (the suplier) about the problem, all they could offer was for me to send the unit back. That's not a easy deal with a big, bulky item like this. I ended up purchasing a 220 ""step-up"" converter for about another $20 with shipping and now it works fine. I wish that I had known about this plug and voltage issue before making the purchase. I might add that this is one of the few times that I've been disappointed with a purchase from Amazon."
5,Perfect for Adopting Parents flying to bring home child,Wow! This book with its format and text is ideal for parents flying to pick up their most precious cargo: their new child!
5,an adorable book that children will want read again and agai,"This is a beautiful book about a bird making her way through the world and back home again. The illustrations are wonderfully done, there is a die-cut in each page which fascinates children. I gave it as a gift, and have been looking for more copies as the mother said it was her daughters favorite book."
4,Another Dorsey book...But...,"I love Tim Dorsey and Serge A. Storms. He writes awesome books, but this one was kind of lacking. What was with the hunt for Ms. Right? C'mon!! And bringing Coleman back to life?! Give me a break, that was just stupid!! The book really dragged in the middle too. The end was good though, very exciting. But over all, it wasn't his best. Much better than Stingray Shuffle, but still not as good as the other ones."
1,Awful,"I purchased this book in an airport, looking for a funny way to spend a few hours on my flight. I was enticed by the comparisons to Carl Hiaasen, of whom I am a huge fan. This book was just awful. I only got through the first 50 pages, and then thankfully my plane landed and I could get on with my life. I found the writing choppy and the characters uninteresting."
5,One of the Great Florida Culture Novels,Tim Dorsey is at the lunatic fringe by daring to write the hilarity of Florida characters that ring true. Once you read Topedo Juice you will be hooked. Serge Storms is the best anti hero since Terry Southern wrote The Magic Christian. You will be laughing so hardy with Coke not Torpedo Juice shooting out your nose. Dorsey is in a league of his own and Torpedo Juice is a mental margarita for the mind.
3,"It Ain't Shakespeare, It's Dorsey","For me, a Tim Dorsey fan, Torpedo Juice was an enjoyable visit back to the Florida world of Serge and Coleman. Dorsey eventually connects the dots of the story, but it's the thought processes of Serge and those ""Darwin-Award"" winning characters sprinkled throughout, who give this book it's appeal.I give the book a 3.5 on a Dorsey rating scale. I would've liked to see Coleman just a bit less gross and showing some redeeming quality. I also missed the wilds of vacuum-nosed cocaine connoisseur Sharon, but truly enjoyed watching Serge tackle the soul-mate search as he finds and attempts to honor then obey his honey until ""death do us part."" As usual with Dorsey's humorous voice tickling my funnybone, I laughed out loud."
1,(No spoiler here) The death of Serge...,"I have read all of this author's novels, so I'm going to keep this short and sweet: Tim Dorsey and Serge A. Storm fans: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! I don't know if Mr. Dorsey was going thru a pessimistic frame of mind when he wrote this but this is the worst, as well as the least funny novel he has ever written--the plot is horrible and confusing, due to its timeframes jumping all over the place, there are too many characters, making it more confusing, and NONE of them are remotely likable or identifiable and Serge in this installment is the biggest wuss I've ever seen and ineffectual in every one of his encounters--I was shocked and VERY disappointed, so much in fact that even though the copy I ordered was PERSONALLY AUTOGRAPHED by the author, I gave it away--personal aside to Mr. Dorsey, if you don't like Serge anymore or the crime genre in particular, PLEASE either write something different or don't write anymore."
1,Dorsey is a 2nd rate Carl Hiaasen,"If you think its hilarious when the heros buy, steal and use drugs, but the height of evil when a dealer sells them...If you cheer when the hero sadistically tortures and kills people (for being rude to his girlfriend, no less) and boo when the villain shoots another drug dealer...If you like your villains to be one-dimensional cardboard cutouts with no motivation beyond what is necessary to set them up as targets for the hero...If you think plots are optional providing the scenes are ""zany"" enough......then you'll love this novel.Otherwise, do yourself a favor: read the Florida-based author whose books are complex, funny and moving, populated with characters that you can care about and believe in (well, almost!), occassionally subtle and always entertaining -- and yes, zany too if you like zany -- namely, Carl Hiaasen."
3,"Florida author, Florida tale","I buy Tim Dorsey novels because he is a Florida author and Florida settings are in many of his books. They make good gifts since we live in Florida. I keep a couple of them on the bedside tables in my guest rooms too. Some of his characters are a little strange but I understand they are loosely based on actual folks from Florida so that makes them more interesting to us and to our guests. As an artist, I love most of his book covers, by the way."
5,Tim Dorsey is fab!,"I enjoyed this odd, quirky book and have loved all of Tim Dorsey's tales. I laughed out loud often and hard with the reading of Torpedo Juice."
4,Kicking back in the Keys,"Dorsey's seventh outing with Florida obsessed Serge A. Storms and stoner pal Coleman settles in for a breezy time in the Keys. Serge this time decides it's time to get married and meets new (and dangerous) characters in the Keys.Being a longtime Florida resident, Dorsey knows his locale. Some fans of this series say this book was slow-paced, I disagree. Dorsey captured the feeling of being in the Keys as it is. People come to the Keys to either fish, dive or drink. So I thought the pacing was appropriate.With slick, stylish prose and his ingenous way of wrapping a plot around the high jinks and a few barbed comments about marriage, Dorsey keeps this series fresh."
5,A mixture of powerful guitar licks and well done vocals,To not hear (Wayne) Scott Farley live is to watching a braodway play on VHS. He is very dynamic and presnts outstanding arrangments with a tight and experienced band.Get the CD but see the show !
5,great gift to give with a disposable camera!,I gave this gift for a 11 year old birthday party with a disposable camera. The Birthday girl took pictures and then made a memory album with the pictures she took. It is something she will have as a great keepsake!
3,A recap but beware,"If you bought season 1 you better buy this before season 2 cause all of the voices have changed. And you might not like the changes, better spending 20 than 50 dollars and not liking it."
5,Just what I expected,"The Killerspin Training 2-star balls are just what I expected and I've gotten some great use out of them. Actually, out of quite a few games I'm still using the first ball and imagine it will be years before I get through the two boxes (12 balls) I bought."
2,Beware: a beginner's work-out,"Don't buy this DVD if you are looking for a more intermediate workout. I am in decent shape, and I barely broke a sweat doing it. Another caveat, this DVD work-out is to a Latin BEAT, there's NO MUSIC. I really like Spanish music, which is why I bought it, but there is just a salsa-sounding synthesized beat in the background that didn't get me too excited about the exercises."
2,Incredible bad quality!,"When I first put this dvd on, I thought I was watching an old, worn out videotape. The quality of the screen is very bad, I think it was a bad copy from video to dvd.Apart from that, the workout is definitely for beginners: the moves are very simple and not challenging at all. But most of all, I thought it was very boring. Just doing a lot of the same repetitions. I sold the dvd immediately, what a waste of money."
5,Get a handle on clutter,"Pros: Well designed for easy reference for all your clutter projects. Excellent solutions to all your clutter problems.A program to understand clutter and what it represents.Cons: Loved the book cover illustration, would have liked a few more pictures in the book for motivation. (review by about.com)I love books like this. Even though my house is fairly organized now, I have to be vigilant not to fall back into my old cluttery ways."
5,Exciting ~ Enjoyable~Energetic~,"When I started to read this book, I didn't know what to expect. What I found was a ""page-turner"" of a book! Brian DeVido has captured the hard world of boxing and relates it to the reader in a very realistic way. We almost feel every punch and jab as if we were inside the ring ourselves. Amos, ""Scrap Iron"" Fletcher, is a down and out boxer who searches to find a way to be successful in the game that he loves. The character development of Amos, the protagonist, proceeds seemingly effortlessly, from beginning to end. Along the way, Amos seeks the approval of Sonny Liston's spirit as his mentor. The plot is convincing and well woven in rounds instead of chapters. This book is not just for the boxing afficionado. It is for EVERYMAN!!DeVido has a clever style that ropes you in and keeps you coming back for more.If you are looking for an exciting book... get Every Time I Talk To Liston."
2,Second rate story telling,"Who wrote these reviews? The author and his mother?This is a simple-minded, cliche-ridden story. Ok, it's got a good hook (Sonny Liston as likable role model) but otherwise, it's a lame, feel good, happy-ending story of the poor-boy-makes-good-in-the-face-of-adversity genre.The 20somethings who may or may not read this should not forget: Sonny Liston was the prototype for the present generation of boxer. It's his sort that ruined the sport. He's a felon who beat a second-rate champion and immediately lost his title to a loud-mouth upstart. To make him a misunderstood hero is revisionist history at best and pure trash in reality. The author as much as admits he knows nothing about the man but used him as a device.I give it 2 stars only because the author knows something about the game. As a novel, however, it's junk."
4,Very Inspiring!,A very easy read for a subject that can be complicated. I could identify with every step of Jean's journey. The healing modalities she used to help in her evolution were fascinating to learn about. I was inspired to delve deeper into my being and expand the possibilities of my soul's journey.
4,Cute toy,This is adorable and my dog had a ball while it lasted. I replaced the squeaker from another toy and she's back to lovin it.
4,Great Collection of Stories From A Great Writer,David James Duncan gives us a book full of stories from his past and new fiction. These stories give great incite to what caused the development of the River Why and The Brothers K
5,My favort book is only a click away,"On a long trip up and down the west coast I picked this book up in a shabby bookstore in the hills of San Francisco on a lonely rainy night. It gave me a strange and warm comfort as I battled my way through the vicous rain for the last two weeks of my trip. The book is erre in ways I cannot explain, simply because you read it and understand it so well. Everything Duncan describes has been a part of all our lives somewhere, somehow. This book deeply moved me, and though I was mearly 16 on that rainy night I can never escape the vivid imagery of Duncan's voice."
5,I laughed out loud in the library . . .,"as I read this book. Although I don't like fishing (Duncan's favorite subject), I do like good stories. And Duncan knows how to write them. This book is easy to read because it is a compilation of short stories, albeit some better than others. But all the stories are worth reading at least once. And believe me, after the first time, you will be returning to read a few of the stories over and over. I know I did."
1,Aero-bed - All 3 of mine leak!,"I purchased three Aero beds to serve as temporary beds during our familys' recent move. All three of the beds didn't last even one night. My wife and I were on a double and found ourselves hitting the floor by the morning. Neither of us are anything that is consdiered overweight... My two sons (both under 80 lbs) were on twin beds and both of their beds leaked significantly. We heard such glowing reviews of Aero beds by friends, but apparently those were the older models as the three that we purchased are completely worthless. So much for spending over $500 on three mattresses that are now going in the garbage can. What a complete waste of money."
4,Great Sword,"I ordered this for a scene with stage combat. It's very sturdy (you hit them pretty hard in combat) and light weight, I'm considering taking some fencing classes now that I have a foil. So just wanted people to know that this sword is great for stage combat as well, only giving it 4 instead of 5 because it came late."
1,bad wiring,"I purchased two of these for practice, one for me and one for my nephew, his quit after it's second use, mine is still working but the wiring is crummy, difficult to repair and the connection is dreadful. It is difficult to connect, difficult to unconnect and is loose."
4,A textbook of basebal history,"Leonard Koppett's book does not get a 5 star rating by me only because it is hard to rate a textbook as a 5. Still, this is a great book. It is along the lines of an SABR release, though the statistics are of a different type. I liked this book, but it will appeal only to those who want a deeper understanding of how the game has mirrored society and how the issues of today are not unlike those of the past. This is a history project, but a very good one. Read this with some of the histories by Harold Seymour and the game will appear much different come the spring. I would also recommend BASEBALL by Ken Burns and Geoffrey Ward.I admire Koppett greatly for attempting such a project as thisCONCISE HISTORY OF MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL."
2,Bad piggy,This a very dark collection of tunes. Not all that bluesy either. I found five or six songs out of how many? Save your money. Buy Alligator records anniversary 35x35
4,Great!,The season 6 dvd was great and in perfect condition! Numb3rs is a great show and this was the perfect gift for the ultimate fan.thanks.
4,Good intelligent tv,Good stories . To bad its gone. The curent crop of tv shows have very little imagination. Numbers was'nt a re-hash of previous shows each show was an original.
5,no more cbs,"I love this show and I love this set. But at least I don't have to watch CBS any longer now that they've canceled it. The plus of this set is what the show always had- great writing and acting, attention to detail, great production, math & science background. The negatives are what CBS brought to it- cut the season short, forced immediate re-writing, neglected support for extras."
3,Good series losing steam,"While I loved this series toward the end it definitely began running out of steam. As usual, to zip things up, the writers began adding more racey themes, never too offensive, but I really enjoyed earlier episodes where I felt comfortable viewing with the whole family. There is nothing too racy but I sensed the writers lost their commitment to producing something smart and enjoyable for the whole family. I definitely recommend earlier seasons."
3,Great Series with a Rough Ending,"The Final Season of Numb3rs was all kinds of strange in comparison to previous seasons. The show was great, overall, but something changed after the 4th season and season 5 and 6 were ""off"". What is humorous to note is that in Season 5, 100 episodes was celebrated. In the bonus footage, everyone talked about how great it was to work together and that they could go on for another hundred episodes. Season 6 was 18 episodes, and I won't provide spoilers, but to say the finale was uneventful would be an understatement. I don't personally know what changed, but I guess I will have to enjoy the previous seasons that I am fortunate to have on DVD as well."
1,what happended to the math?,"The math and numerics are gone and it's all blood and gore for the final season of numbers. We are lucky if they recycle a theory from previous seasons and once, Charlie is only brought in because he can ""track a cell phone faster"" than the computers. Sad to see they ""ran out of mathematics"" and resorted to lowest common denomenator violence and hysteria. Good to see a show about math make it this long though."
3,Cool Season disappointing ending,"I enjoyed the season, especially as I missed many of the episodes or came in late. However, I was disappointed in the ending. It seemed fractured. I did enjoy having all of the semi regular guest actors show up in the last episode. The way the episode ended left it open for a new season if it ever comes back."
2,Won't cry over its demise.,"This show was watchable for me at first, with a decent premise and good actors, but the writing became increasingly ""politically correct"" over the years. I think the last straw was the episode where Hirsch was remembering when his boys ""used to light dead ants on fire"" with a magnifying glass. Light DEAD ants on fire with a magnifying glass ? Give me a break. Perhaps PETA got all warm and squishy over that line, but I was and remain disgusted. I'm happy to see this one die on the vine, but would watch it if they brought it back with dialogue from the great big real world outside of California."
5,Good Value for Good series,Enjoyed the series on TV and love the price and availability on Amazon making the series affordable.
5,pascal does it again,"gaia is finally happy. she and sam are finally a couple. the only cloud hanging over this happy arrangement is that her uncle wants her to go to europe with him and will stoop to all levels to get what he wants. what is poor gaia supposed to do? her stepmother ella died in her place, she thinks her father is the devil incarnate because ella said that he killed her mother, so is our poor heroine supposed to have any type of a happy normal life? or is it going to be one disappointment after another? stay tuned. this series has more plot twist than any book or series i have ever read. more to come same bat channel same battime. could not resist"
4,"Akerman's 1st feature. Often sad, sometimes absurdly funny.","A 3 part film, with little plot, following a young, neurotic woman first stuck alone in her room over a period of days,then hitching a ride with a truck driver on her way to meet her female lover and developing an odd relationshipwith him, and last spending the night making love with her lover, then leaving.The images, though often interesting, don't have quite the power of Akerman's best work, and while some momentshave a real charge, sexual or emotional, others feel awkward.Certainly intelligent and complex, and wistfully touching in the end, but somehow missing that that step to greatness,the first third is very strong, the second almost as good, but the last feels less complete, and the 15 minute love makingscene is sort of awkward in that it's very explicit, but never seems real. Less might have been more in this case.But, for any flaws, this is well worth seeing if you have any interest in Akerman's impressive body of work."
3,400+ Historic designs,While this book does show on some of the designs a diagram showing how the patterns are constructed I found it much too sketchy to really follow out how they were made. I ended up buying a companion Dover book titled 'Celtic Art:The Methods of Construction' to get a better sense of how to make these patterns step-by-step. One good thing about this book is that the source for each design shown is documented. Buy this book and the one I listed above and you'll have plenty of designs to use in your own artwork.
5,A message of relevance,"I am thankful for the message that Mrs. Dove lovingly shares with young women; she expresses a truth that, if embraced, truly has the potential to set women free to live full lives. The truth is that modesty of body and spirit is a powerful blessing for both women and men, and the author shares practical tips as well as the spiritual truths behind the principle of modesty. A relevant message presented with excellence."
1,Sexist piece of crap.,"I picked this book off of my sister's shelves thinking I was going to be in for a good read. I was so, so wrong.This book is all about how women should change themselves to please men. Dove encourages her readers to go to charm school instead of college to learn how to be good little wives. She also stresses the importance of knowing how to cook and cleaning, insinuating that a woman who can't do either is unlovable and worthless. The book also says that women need to marry a man who is both smarter and stronger than they are so they can be adequately ""protected"".Do NOT, under any circumstances, give this book to your daughter/niece/friend/whomever. It's a load of misogynistic rubbish that will only pollute her mind and wreck her self-esteem. If you want her to read good Christian books, have her read C.S. Lewis's ""The Chronicles of Narnia""--they have both a good Christian message and will encourage girls to be smart, strong, and capable like the women in the story."
1,religious conservative's attempt to influence teen girls,"While Grace Dove is entitled to her opinion that women should be subserviant to men, those purchasing the book should be informed that teen girls are being given some outlandish advice and information. For example, Dove claims that there is a rise in homosexuality because women compete with men in the workplace. She also says girls should go to charm school, not college. Dove also believes women working and horoscopes are linked to witchcraft."
3,An excellent overview of medevil times.,It was a really good book for middle readers. I would recommend it to anyone who is having trouble reading harder books.
4,My daughter loves it,"This is my daughters comfort toy. We bought spares. One ended up getting a hole in the bottom. One got all pilled. I am sure this is for ""collectors"" but it is a damn toy!"
2,Did I miss something?,"Not impressed at all. Too wordy, too elementary, and too flat. I enjoy books that create images, that causes you to use your imagination, and that stir emotions. This book did nothing for me. Usually I am very leery of books that do not subscribe to ""search inside"" which allows me to read an excerpt. Took a chance this time and was sorely disappointed."
3,Library Book,"I am enjoying my book Wings of Grace, I just don't like having a used book, never had a used book before. The Book was not available new"
5,One of the Best,"This book will keep you glued to it folks; Guaranteed; I just finished last night and it kept me going; You had one woman(Johnnie Mae)with a lot on her plate, when she meets this old woman(Sarah)who tells her a story so incredible that even she don't believe it; Ok, hold that for a minute; Theresa and Lena have gotten closer, and were now awaiting the birth of Theresa's child when a stranger(or not)graces them with her presence;Then is when the sparks fly; Hold that too; Now, add this special necklace, a person's lifelong obsession to get it, the search for a family that may have been right under Johnnie Mae's nose all along and you have the makings of a good story; You won't be able to put it down because you want to know what happened and how. But somehow, I feel a sequel in this too;"
1,Incredibly disappointing,"Don't waste your money on this disc. It is an old videotape transferred to DVD, of poor quality and amateurish videography. In addition, it is not an accurate portrait of Salamanca. It is neither appealing, educational nor professionally done. I have family and friends in that lovely old city, and this recording is an embarrassment to both their cultural heritage and contemporary lifestyle. The strong emphasis on religious processions is not representative (go to Seville for that), and viewers get no clue about most of the city's architectural and natural beauty. The camera dwells on a scene (the university guys singing) without explanation of what it means, while it rushes through others (the bridge over Tormes) where further viewing angles were expected, based on the voice description. In a sentence, this is a hugely overpriced item, offering bad quality video, and scatterbrained narration."
4,Read book last Spring and now am listening to the Audio version,"I read the book last spring while on vacation with my husband and his parents (I bought it in the airport, because the cover caught my eye). Needless to say, my husband asked that his parents not get a glimpse of the cover...this truly made me laugh and made me dive headlong in the book!It's a very strange book and those of us with twisted senses of humor and the world we live in will enjoy it for sure. I would suggest it in text format, but the Audio version with Fisher Stevens had made me want to sit in the horrible Atlanta traffic as long as I can! Ha, ha, ha...As for the book, I have read other books my Mr. Moore, but for some reason Charlie attracts me...I want more and more."
5,Humorous & not what I expected,"Being that this was my first Christopher Moore book, I was not sure what to expect, but some friends whose opinions I highly value said they read it and enjoyed it, so I decided to give it a go.This book left me very pleasantly surprised from the opening paragraphs to the conclusion. The characters are well developed, so you do care about what happens to them throughout the well done romp. The story itself is written in such a style that it suspends your disbelief well and immerses you in the covers.If you are looking for something a little off the beaten path and have stumble upon this novel, I would highly recommend this! Happy reading!"
5,Oh So Funny...,"This book just kept me in stitches. All the characters were funny and blended well with the story. The ending was a shocker to say the least. I am recommending this to everyone and this authors other book ""Biff"". That was funny."
4,"A fun, irreverent diversion","My daughter got me this for a holiday gift. I had a lot of fun with it. Now if I can just get the kids to stop pointing and shouting ""KITTY!"" every time they want something to drop dead. . . . ."
2,Could have been a lot better,"This is the first Christopher Moore I have read and I was disappointed. I would not say that Christopher Moore is ripping off Terry Pratchett, but the idea of Death as a transporter of souls is very similar to Pratchett's Mort, with San Francisco substituting Ank-Morporkh. Even then this could have been a much better read if the plot were not so slow developing. He could easily have written a much more enjoyable and concise book if he had kept it to about 250 pages."
4,One of the funniest novels,"Someone recommended Moore to me and this book did not disappoint. There were moments I put the book down laughing and found myself still laughing later that day. The style is conversational and his irreverence is intoxicating. This book got right into the plot by the second page, no set ups or waiting around. There didn't seem to be a scene I couldn't visualize; just flat out fun to read. I've always revered Stephen King for his vicious humor but now I've found a new god to worship.The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the ending. Moore introduces a character about 80% through the book that is pivotal to the ending and she feels forced into the action whereas everyone else seemed to fit together nicely. And the real stopper? The cover gave away the ending!Keep up the laughs, Christopher."
4,Death walks with a cane...,"This is first Chris Moore book I've read and I'm glad I've discovered this writer (this is his 9th book, so I've got some catching up to do!). This book reminded me of Anansi Boys by Gaiman, so if you liked one, you'll probably like the other. I say probably, because Moore is a bit loose with the crude language (which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars).The characters in the book will keep you laughing, and the story will keep you wanting to read more moore.I saw Moore at a book signing and he's just as funny in person. Go see him on tour if you can."
5,I'm begging you to read this book!!!,"This is the book that got me HOOKED on Christopher Moore books. It is so different and funny. I kept laughing out loud and reading pieces to my husband. This is the kind of book that you can't wait to see how it ends, but you feel so sad that it's over.Read Bloodsucking Fiends and You suck. They're all related. It's Harry Potter for the adult, and I mean adult, reader!!!!!"
4,I Always Want Moore,"This wasn't my favorite Christopher Moore book, as it wasn't laugh out loud funny the way most of the others are. However, it still features Moore's classic well-developed charaters in interesting situtions and amusing interactions. I recommend it, but if I was introducing a friend to Moore, I would reach for a different book to lend."
2,What A Disappointment!,"Christopher Moore used to write really twisted, fall-off-the-chair-laughing funny books. However, since he has discovered ""Big Themes"" (with ""Fluke"" and now ""A Dirty Job""), he seems to have lost his touch. ""A Dirty Job"" has a moderate level of weirdness (I loved the hell hounds blowing soap bubbles!) but the humor is weak compared to his earlier books. If you want good Christopher Moore, go back to the early days: If ""The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove"" doesn't make you laugh until tears run down your face, you need to check your pulse."
4,"A Unique Mix: Black-humor, satire, spiritual reflection, romance and a thriller.","This was my first Christopher Moore book, but it certainly will not be my last. It's as thoughCarl Hiassencombined withAlice Hoffman. The latter's wonderful attention to the spiritual, the occult and the romantic is mixed with the former's delightful and humorous sense of the outrage and absurdity of everyday life and the plight of everyman, with the ability of both to tell a good story that seems realistic while completely departing from reality.Moore achieves all of that, while offering his own reflections on life and death and a spot-on, thorough and sympathetic explanation of the ""Beta male"" type (you know, as opposed to Alpha males).Expect quirky. This novel is the equivalent of an indie film, so do not go in anticipating a mainstream read. If indie is O.K. with you, though, I highly recommend this book."
5,Great book!,"This was the second book I ever read by Christopher Moore, after Lamb, and I have got to say that it did not disappoint!This book is hilarious, filled with great characters and has a nice little twist at the end.Charlie Asher is a delightful protagonist; silly and clumsy but just enough so we like him and want to know how his life is going to turn out.I also really enjoy how Moore give brief cameo's and starring roles to characters we already know from his other works, such as jody and minty fresh; it makes you feel like you've actually gotten to know them."
5,A Beautiful Modern Fairy Tale,"This is a great novel full of both surprising humor and deep human pathos. It is reminiscent of the novels of Terry Pratchett, but with an evocative modern-day San Francisco in the place of Pratchett's imaginary Discworld. A Dirty Job not only gives you a charmingly maudlin protagonist and a quick, engaging story, but it also provides a fascinating and unique look at the way people deal with loss and living. Great heart and great wit are a rare combination in literature, and Christopher Moore brings them together brilliantly--- and in a novel about death, no less. Quite an accomplishment."
4,Awesome......,"Second favorite from this author. Loved it. Crazy as all get out, but wouldn't have it any other way. Thank you Mr. Moore for such great, crazy books/characters. Worth every penny."
3,"it was okay, but nowhere near the compelling genius of Lamb","Funny, though hard for a new parent to read since it involves a mother dying after childbirth and an infant being threatened by demons. Overall, it was okay, but nowhere near the compelling genius of Lamb.For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal."
3,It was just okay...,"Moore's ""Lamb"" is one of the top two or three books that I think everyone should read. ""A Dirty Job"" was fairly entertaining, but compared to ""Lamb"" it was so-so. I liked the character development, but some of it read like filler material. If you haven't read ""Lamb"", get it instead."
3,for post-goths that have grown up; Tom Robbins fans looking to branch out,"A little predictable (esp. if you're familiar w/ Moore's work) but overall an amusing read. There are a couple of elements that seem to come out of nowhere but ultimately it all ties together nicely. It's also nice to see Moore re-using His Highness (hey, as long as we're setting the story in his San Francisco, right?). That said, parts of this story feel like warmed-up left-overs from Blood Sucking Fiends.Get it from your library for some light reading."
4,strange and funny,A peculiar easy read. What I would call a typical Christopher Moore book because of his unique story lines and great humor. This book also puts life and death in a new light and provokes some thoughts on the meaning behind people's lives once they are gone and how they live on in the world they have left behind.Fast and fun read.
5,A delightful read,"I don't remember a book that made me laugh so much. I enjoyed the peculiar plot, the interesting characters and Moore's hilarious way of describing things. His genius is in the way that he depicts dark events and characters with wit, clarity and empathy. It was just a wonderful, funny, delightful read. I highly recommend this book."
2,Garbled and Overrated,"""A Dirty Job"" was my first Christopher Moore novel, and will probably be my last. I was captivated by the story line as I read the dust jacket, but found that the writing was not nearly as interesting. I thought the author spent way too many pages with humdrum matters of no real interest, and very little addressing the actual theme of the book. Although wanting to relate sympathetically to the book's hero, I just wasn't drawn in enough to care about him. The action began in the final quarter of the book, and you had better suspend reality before reading it. I actually couldn't wait for the book to end so I could move on to something more interesting."
3,not his best,"I usually Love Love Love Christopher Moore.......this one.......not so much. Still worth the read, if you're a Moore fan."
3,Not As Good (or Entertaining) as Biff,"No whaley boys in this one, and kind of a dumb premise. Terry Pratchett has a much better grasp and affinity for Death."
2,It interested me at times but other times I just could not get into the story,"Right when reading what the book was about I was excited to read the book but was overall dissapointed. First off I have never read a Christopher Moore novel before so i dont know how her writes or his humor and so on. Sadely from the start of the book i could not get into it, by page 100 I got into it and found it enjoyable and funny at times, sadley by page 200 I lost interest again when hardley nothing happend and the story draged on. Overall I was upset with the book and would not recomand it."
5,fantastic,"i had been waiting for the new book for a while and was not let down when i received it! another completely off the wall, twisted book... i really wish i could understand how christopher moore can crack some of the most twisted jokes and hilarious dialogue in the same breath as a very touching passage about losing a loved one. truly is one of his best yet!"
2,This can be funny in parts,Review of the audiobook: I was looking forward to this one. I had read Lamb and enjoyed it even though it had many objectionable parts to it. I couldn't get over the swearing in this one. To much. I if you can get past that then you would probably like this book. I couldn't.
5,Amazingly funny.,"Love this author! Always a good read.All I could think about are the ""puppies"" and that little girl, wonderful."
3,Get ready to REALLY suspend your disbelief!,"I enjoy quirky humor and this book has that in abundance, along with enough twists & turns to keep you reading. Now, I understand this is a TOTAL fantasy book, but even in fantasy, there are rules to abide by. The level of unbelievability in this book is outrageous and as a reader I'm left with a lot of ""how in the world are they supposed to deal with that"" questions that distract from the plot of the book and aren't answered in the least.That being said, the humor is quick & snarky just how I like it and the characters are juuuuust off the wall enough to make you laugh out loud. Would I read more by this author...ummmm, maybe. But it's gonna be pretty low on the must read priority list."
5,Finding humor in the grimmest of subjects,"Christopher Moore's style of humor is unique. He deals cheerfully with the grimmest of subjects. In this book he finds comedy in the workings of death. As in previous works, the book is populated with various wacky characters from the `beta male' death merchant protagonist to a toddler who can kill with a single word. Even the `sewer harpies' are funny. This may be his finest work yet, though readers may want to try Practical Demonkeeping."
4,"Funny, but the plot doesn't live up to being Death.","First, this book has a lot of laugh out loud moments. If you want to read a great modern humor writer, read this book.However, the plot is not magical and left me feeling so much more could have been done exploring Death mythos.SPOILERSCharlie isn't THE Death. He's a death. There are lots of guys like him. They don't exactly know what they're doing, or why what they're doing helps anybody. They can't even talk to each other for reasons never quite explained.That sucks the fun out of reading a book about becoming death, but hey, maybe Mr. Moore (who I've never read before) will still make this a comic exciting romp.But the ending just happens. There's no real sense of fufillment. Supposedly there's going to be a showdown of mythical deaths to be the one true Death... but not very many deaths show up. The one that wins doesn't seem to have any history like the others do."
5,A Dirty Job,This is one of the best books I have ever read. Christopher Moore is a literary genius. I loved this book from the beginning to the end and it was very hard to put down.
3,Good Read,This was the first from the author that I read. I thought it was a great take on death and how the rest of the world relates to it. There were some great funny moments in the book. I loved the witty sarcasm of the writing and how it is the closest to conversational that I have seen in a long time. The ending is a little weird but I enjoyed the book all in all.
4,Not his funniest,This is not Christopher Moore at his best. It is funny and irreverant and fully entertaining. But if you have never read Moore before start at with and earlier work like Blood Sucking Fiends. After you have read a couple of his books you can fully enjoy the more subtle humour that you would otherwise miss.
4,Another winner by Christopher Moore,"Charlie Asher, a grieving husband and father is given the job of ""death merchant"" which is in layman's terms a soul collector. It is not a job he wants or was paticularly good at in the beginning but as he becomes more adept at it, he finds that it has it perks and of course it also has it's downside, but don't all jobs, LOL. The perks, invisiblity, hell hounds to babysit his daughter and of course prosperity among other things, the downside, well I guess having the sewer harpies wanting to pull you limb from limb could be considered a downside along with having a daughter that can kill with just a point of her finger and the word kitty. This book is so full of dry wit and dark humor that will find yourself laughing out loud. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys dark humor and is not bothered by profanity. It is a fun and quick read."
2,Eh,This book was too silly. Not to mention that because everyone has the exact same sense of humor..a dry obvious wit I was always aware that I was reading a book written by one person rather than engaging in all the characters. I found the humor annoying and eye-rolling rather than smart and funny. Not to mention that the lead character is more neurotic that Woody Allen. b-o-r-i-n-gI could see this being a cartoon.
4,Funny entertaining book,"This book was recommended to me as sort of a weird, twisted, but funny book. That it is. The first time I read it (from the library), I laughed so hard, and I kept having to share snipbits of it. I decided I needed to own it, because it was just too funny, and I knew I would read it time and time again. But, maybe I just wasn't feeling it the second time, because I hardly laughed at all. I dunno. I still think it's a funny book, but less funny and some slightly annoying things (the whole talk of beta males got boring after a paragraph) came out. That's why only 4 stars."
5,Very Entertaining,"I love how he uses real life characters, places and situations to bring together a dark fictional novel. Very creative. Worth a read."
5,"Death, Someone has to do it.","I was introduced to this book by a friend who claimed it was laugh out loud funny. She was not joking.This book had me laughing and crying in the first 5 pages. Any book that can take you from one emotion to the next so quickly is worth your time.Christopher Moore weaves a tale of one man's journey as death. Though there have been many novels about this subject, none have really looked at the humorous side of death and what it entails. This books makes death more approachable and less of a frightening thing to the reader.Characters created by Moore take on a life of their own. His development of characters is superb. Not only do they add to the story, you find yourself either relating to the characters or knowing someone just like them. His gift to make the characters real makes the book even more enjoyable."
4,My favorite of his so far,"I've read many of Moore's books, including the Bloodsucking Fiends trilogy that paves the way for this narrative. While the other books have all been full of snark, wit, absurdity, and heart, there is a tenderness in this one that kept me on the edge of my seat. I'll remember Charlie for a long time. If that's not the mark of an excellent storyteller, I don't know what is."
4,A Dirty Job,"After losing his wife, Charlie is left to raise a child but he isn't exactly on his own. He has a sister, 2 co workers from his store and a neighbor. Having all those people are a good thing because Charlie also found out he is, what he calls, a Death Merchant. Charlie collects souls for what exactly he doesn't know. He does know that if he does not collect them the darkness from below rises to condemn the world.Christopher Moore has a way will writing humorous stories. There is a attachment you find with the characters that makes it not too funny but gives a warm feeling towards them. My favorite part is when Charlie keeps buying his daughter pets and they keep dying. Then one day two hellhounds appear protecting her and eating pretty much anything. The way the book ends I kinda do expect a sequel. Love Moore's writing will continue reading his books."
3,Disappointed,"I live in England and according to the estimated delivery date i should have received this watch between the 1st and 20th of feb but i actually got it today (27 Jan). That was fantastic. My excitement didn't go much further. The watch itself is beautiful piece and is one of the best looking chronograph with a 40mm face (ideal for small wrists) however the main reason why i purchased this watch over other chronos is for the alarm function which sadly does not work! I've read through the manual and have gone through all the instructions, the test for just checking the alarm tone is fairly basic and gives no sound what so ever. had a look on google and it seems a spring may have popped out during a battery replacement before it was shipped. All in all its a great watch but in my case it lacks the functionality i intended for it."
1,what a rip off by Amazon!,"I can't believe I just paid 6 bucks for a 300 word digital article! I thought I was getting a long article, not 300 lousy words.I should have read the fine print carefully, but guess I just never expected that Amazon is shameless enough to charge 6 bucks for 300 lousy words!"
3,Yikes!,"Ok, considering i have not spent that much time reading this book, mainly because it creates nausium with all the statistical talk, i think its a pretty good book. Just know that its not a story or interviews or anything like that. Lots of percentages. The volume i bought actually has a reddish cover, i think its slightly newer. Also, i happened to switch over to learning how to trade using bar charts, i like it much better. The candles....work, but i hate how i see all the different candle signs i have learned all over the place!! And i think all the candle patterns are seen just as easy with the good ole HLCO bars. I recommend Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques by Steve Nison if you want to learn about a bunch of candle signs/patterns...its an awesome book that i bought based on recommendations of two pro traders i follow. Good luck, never quit!!"
3,encyclepedia of chart patterns,Its just what its supposed to be a reference book . When it comes to trading its not that big a help. I amlearning that to make money its money managment and stop loss that makes the difference.
4,a complete guide to all pattern,without doubt this book is a complete cyclopedia of chart patterns but some parts are so streched .
5,Bulkowski's books = INDISPENSABLE,"I own three of Thomas Bulkowski's books, including ""Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns"" and ""Encyclopedia of Candlestick Patterns"". As a day trader and chartist (Twitter: @peterghostine), I simply cannot survive without these two indispensable references on my desk. I can tell you without hesitation that if you wish to become a successful trader or technician, add Thomas Bulkowski's books to your collections. In addition, all of the author's books are written to keep you entertained while you absorb the invaluable material. He's an excellent writer, trader, and investor."
4,I have recommended it many times,"This is a unique book that presents the concept of chart patterns as clearly as I have ever seen. Chart analysis is an ambiguous thing to do and other ""encyclopedias"" concentrate too much on a few perfect examples that never seem to appear in real life. Mr Bulkowski also defines each pattern and provides some statistics from a sample set of observations, but digs into the detail much further in order to address the ambiguity of charting. When I talk to new traders who want to start building a library, this is one of the top three books I recommend first."
4,An essential trade reference...,"This is one book in my library to which I continually refer and consider it essential to anyone who trades chart patterns. That's not just me talking - trader Dan Zanger of ChartPattern.com (who holds the stock trading record with a 29,000% audited annual return 1998-1999) and who I've written a number of articles about considers it one of the three best books ever written for traders (the other two are Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefevre and How to Make Money in Stocks by William O'Neil). Yes, some (mostly newer) traders will find the statistics a little daunting but trading is all about probability so these numbers are essential. Bulkowski is the first to admit that chart patterns are anything but perfect in dictating trades but they most certainly increase your odds for success!Disclosure - Received complimentary review copy from publisher."
2,Rusts easily,"I have had this for about a year. I love the knife itself, but after just a few months, it started rusting. Too bad."
3,Russian Film,"Dark, depressing, very gloomy. Typical of Eisenstein's war time pieces. Worth seeing for the costumes. The philosophy that Ivan was a man-of-the-people over the interests of the other nobles is so Soviet era."
2,"Movie as terrible, too",Amateur film with pretty bad acting - reminded me of a silent movie. Lots of eye expressions to convey what's going on. Not much of a story. Would have been better in color - see what appeared to be magnificent costumes.
4,Worth at least renting,"If you are interested in the history, check this movie out. The subs aren't exactly great, but it lets you know what's going on."
5,Great reference!,"Any female working in a formerly-male profession will find this book of interest. Since it's been written, several more professions have become ""feminized"" more quickly than has the workforce as a whole. Those of us who are in these professions find that our colleagues argue the same issues over and over without looking to other, similar professions, or to work like this, for information about what is occurring. Although the book may leave you with a bit of a negative attitude, hey, discrimination IS negative! The authors do use this as a call to action, pointing out that what has occurred is not necessarily going to continue, that occupational gender changes are in a state of flux, and that simply understanding what has occurred in the past may help us to change the future."
3,Heavy textbook reading,"This book was assigned for a Gender Inequality at Work class. Nothing much about this book would have gotten me to read it otherwise. Reskin and Ruse certainly can back up their theories regarding women's entry into male-dominated occupations with their extensive data, but they seemed to have a negative attitude about women's capabilities and future potential. One of the most frustrating things about the book was their continual reference, without elaboration, to the ""women's liberation movement"" of the 1970s as a factor in women's accomplishments. The obscure references to the ""women's liberation movement"" made it seem like a magical occurance that was without explanation. I would have liked much more anecdotal information."
4,An Older but Good Introduction to Evolutionary Psychology,"Robert Wright's Moral Animal (1995) is not one of the new books on the topic of evolutionary psychology, but it is a start. Here Wright explains thinking associated with evolutionary psychology and links it to the life and teachings of Charles Darwin. The book is thought provoking and gently takes the reader into this relatively new psychological perspective. Wright's consideration of kin-related altruism was of particular interest to me. For my taste, however, Wright spends more time on Darwin's biography than on introducing evolutionary psychology per se. I will look further to learn more."
5,Uncomfortable information,"This book shows humans in a very unflattering light. I'm reminded of the website that shows moviestars without make-up.We, at the core, are shown to be selfish, manipulative, and calculatingly ruthless. Its very ugly. I highly recommend it. This should be a textbook. This will undoubtedly be hated by many with the same fervor that Darwin's theory is. Possibly more since one can see one's own behavior reflected back in these pages with less imagination than the acceptance of the ontological ""evolution of man"" where people don't see the our connection to cro-magnum."
3,Unconvincing,"A little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing, a truth that Wright blithely ignores in this book. He makes the same mistake that many sociobiologists have made before: jumping from a precious few discoveries about human nature to an attempt to solve our modern social problems.This book is one part presentation of evolutionary psychology, which is useful, and two parts speculation about marriage, child rearing and other issues, which is not.I am hopeful that someday our increased understanding of our origins and nature will help us solve those problems. But humans are much more complicated than Wright would have us believe. In particular, we have almost no understanding of the interplay between cultural evolution and our biological nature. We are just at the beginning."
2,Old hat science and misogyny masquerading as cutting edge...,"Don't waste your time or money. Though the science is adequate and the logic occasionally interesting to follow, the author cannot hide his thinly veiled sexist victorian philsophy. The text is full of barbs aimed at feminists, prostitutes, female scientists, and just about everyone else who doesn't happen to buy the religious right version of morality. If you want insight into the dynamics of male/female relationships, you'd be better served reading ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus"" (but not by much). This book has a hidden agenda, and an ugly one at that."
5,Evolutionary Psychology,"An excellent introduction to the field of evolutionary psychology. If you're interested in the motives behind human behavior, this is the place to start. It's also easy to read considering the content topic."
5,Exceptional introduction and and very detailed,"An extremely interesting book introducing and detailing evolutionary human behavior. Covers a very wide range from thehistory of evolutionary thinking to the latest views. Includes a very good overview of Darwin's views on evolution and howdarwin himself inadvertently behaved as per his own theory. Includes: kin selection, friendship, family, group, and tribalbehavioral dynamics as viewed from an evolutionary point of view.For further reading:Charles Darwin by John BowlbyEvolutionary Psychiatry : A New Beginning by Anthony Stevens, John PriceDarwinian Psychiatry by Michael T. McGuire, Alfonso Troisi"
2,Ponderous Twaddle,"This book is ponderous twaddle. The author seems incrediblyimpressed with himself to the exclusion of his subject.While he brings up some interesting points regarding howhumans evolve, how we accord one another ""status"", all setto the life and times of one Mr. Charles Darwin, I got thefeeling that Mr. Wright was a little too self-congratulatory.The lengthy acknowledgement section confirmed my feelings.I wish authors would take their egos out of their subjectand just present us with the facts as they see it. I guessMr. Wright did prove his own case, however, since he discusseshuman ego and ambition! Other might love this book. I did not."
1,Thanks Wright for making a good case for creationism,"A great parallel with social Darwinism; one thing Wright has not proved through this dogmatically ""religious"" view of Evolutionary Psychology is the validity of moral relativism; which is just as weak as ever."
2,Seriously?,I'm a senior anthro student who had to read this for Biobehavioral Anthropology. The book has some interesting ideas and facts about Darwin's life. However it often goes off on a tangent to prove an isolated point and is oddly written (do you want to read an entire book like this in parenthesis)?
2,Get the Red Queen by Matt Ridley instead,There's no comparison. I found The Moral Animal to be a weaker version the Red Queen by Matt Ridley. SAVE YOUR MONEY and get the Red Queen instead. Ridley clearly communicates while this author left me underwelmed.
5,It's all about Sex and Money,This book is awesome. Dispense with theology and college philosophy. The answers lie here.
4,An issue of morality.,It is one of the greatest books i have come across in the 21st century.it goes that deep into living being.Fantastic details.1``
3,"Very engaging, but not quite captivating...","I read Robert Wright's ""Nonzero"" which I found to be more interesting--though it looks like most reviewers experienced the inverse.There is a lot of detailed analysis which I found to be interesting, but slow going (you know, when you need to re-read a passage three or four times to really understand what he means in context).Read this book if you want to know more about how we think, and be sure to follow it up with ""Nonzero""."
4,A very interesting point of view,"A series of hypothesis and theories, always supported by a scientific presentation of evidence found in other works on the relevant subjects. A very interesting insight in the human nature, in the relationship between men and women, with special regard to the driving forces which influence the human behaviour (sexual desire, greed, hunt for power and wealth etc.)."
2,"Gloating, Biased","Is the main goal of EVERY male evo-psy writer to attack feminism? Here's an experiment for you: Juxtapose the ideas in this book and, say, Pinker's Blank Slate with those of,I don't know, ANY two female evo-psi writers and watch the incongruities jump off the pages. It's f&#%ing comical. But guess what? The females' books are way better thought out and accurate while the males' are a lot of wishful thinking. Hmmm....aging, successful man writes that lovely young lasses and aging, successful males are made for each other. That men are wired to treat sexually liberated women like s@&%, and to fawn over repressed,chastity obsessed airheads. Whatever."
4,This is not a how-to-book but spotlighting Illustrator designers and their work on certain projects,"If you are looking for an Illustrator book in the WOW! sense of things...this one is NOT for you. This is not a how-to book. It's more of profiles of people who utilized Adobe Illustrator for their work. The people profiled talk about a few projects they worked on, how they did certain parts of that work but really, the book is focused more on how the selected designers use Illustrator as a way to communicate their art ideas and so forth. This is recommended for those who consider using Adobe Illustrator for their design and want to learn how other professionals have utilized the software for their projects."
4,Great if you'd like to see what is possible,"I recall that when I was first starting to use Illustrator some 4 odd years ago, this book was very helpful. Not because it is a how-to book per se, but because it shows you what is possible to accomplish in Illustrator. It showcases illustrators and has a tutorial on a technique the artist uses.And after all that time, this is the only Illustrator book I would still pick up, especially since most of the other Illustrator books I've seen sadly rehash the same tutorials over and over."
1,What did I buy?,"I looked at this book for 20 minutes and still had no idea what it was about. I have every book about the Beatles but to me, this was a piece of garbage. This is the only book I've ever returned in my life-anywhere."
5,Amazing book!,"This book is absolutely amazing. The moment I picked it up in the bookstore and ran my hand over its silky smooth cover, I knew at once that book was going to be great. I read it, never stopping, until I finished it. Once I did, I was awestruck. What a perfectly remarkable book! I've read it at least five times and my mother has read it too. Great book! A must read for kids thirteen and up!"
5,Ready or not...I'm gonna play this one to you!,I like to play this album to mates when they come round and see their reaction. I can usually tell a lot about someone's musical taste by the way they digest this record!
3,HDTV Wii Connect,"For anyone who now owns a HDTV, they would need to buy special equipment for their system. Although that is the case with the Nintendo Wii, you would also need to buy a specialty wire connector to hook up the Wii to your HDTV. This one from the third-party company Intec works nicely for some, but it doesn't last as long as the original one Nintendo has made. Although the specialty cable isn't available with the Wii, it is sold seperately through Nintendo's website, and it is a recommended bet. I suggest you buy Nintendo's version instead for the HDTV connection.Price: COverall: C"
3,480P wu who,"Slight dif in resolution, nothing great. Would only recommend for people need AVI spots for other hardware."
4,This cable works ok,"There is a descent picture improvement. these cable are 6 foot long,shorter than the one that you have with your wii."
3,No Optical Support,"The official description says ""An optical input is also included."" The Wii does not support optical output. I purchased this cable thinking I would have digital surround sound with the wii. The Wii only supports analog sound through Dolby Pro Logic. There is no included optical cable.The cables themselves do work fine, just not as the description says."
2,ehh,These cables clear up the picture but they cause the picture to jump at times. The bottom of my screen gets all jumpy. It only happens on my TV when the Wii is on so I know it's the cables. Get the Nintendo cables instead or an S-video set. The Wii isn't HD gaming anyway.
3,Not the cable pictured,"I was looking for a cable that would allow me to plug the video cables into my tv and the audio into my surround sound. The cable shown in the picture would allow me to do this because they split off from each other what appears to be at least half way down the cable. But, the cable I received had them all bundled together until the last couple of inches on the cable. The cable worked but I could not stretch it far enough to get it plugged into my tv and surround sound."
3,Where's the Power?,"The camera is excellent. You can read a hundred reviews as I have on the great job that Canon has done on the design and convience of this little guy. But don't buy it unless you can assure that you can get a rechargable battery kit with it. I've been waiting since just before Christmas to find a supplier who has one in stock (at a reasonable price). In the meantime buying batteries is eating me alive in cost! Apparently, Canon produced two-to-one the camera's to the rechargable battery packs... thus all us unsuspecting buyers got a camera and a backorder notice on the rechargables! BEWARE!"
3,More interesting than I expected,"Ms. Williams writes with surprising candor of her early Hollywooddays. There was a great deal I didn't know about Esther Williams prior to reading her book and was pleasantly surprised to find out what an interesting woman she is! She speaks openly about her co-workers (other movie ""stars""), the education she received from making movies and the studio system and her family life. An astute businesswoman as well, Ms. Williams was also very involved in synchronized swimming including its induction into the Olympics. I was surprised to find that I had a hard time putting the book down."
4,Good Bio if a bit egocentric,"Esther Williams biography is a very descriptive story of Hollywood's heyday, well written and very detailed. I just wasn't aware that Williams was the center of the universe. Her anecdotes are for the most part very interesting, but she was a star and the only stories that reflect badly on her show her as the victim. I also wish that she had started the book with something other than her LSD trip. The details about her family are very sketchy. Why is she supporting her parents when her mother was a psychologist in Hollywood. Her sister June took care of her kids quite often, but other than in this context, she barely mentions her--enjoyable but buy it in paperback."
3,A great look at the Studio era in Hollywood.,Esther Williams bio takes a long hard look at a by-gone era - the 1940's & 50's in Hollywood. It's full of tidbits on several of her leading men as well as her ex-husbands. I just wish it had even more meat and potatoes rather than just the appetizers and the salad. It's a great read for a rainy Sunday afternoon. Read it and share it with a friend who also lived through this period in Hollywood's heyday.
5,Splashy!,"Esther Williams' autobiography is a straight eye-to-eye account of her unique saga with none of the usual coyness of show business biographies. She tells all. In the telling, the book seems naughty at times but, no, it's just honest. It is strange how every man she falls in love with is, um, er, well-equipped but she, um, er, even, um, er, handles those details handily. So to speak. I loved this book."
2,NOT IMPRESSED,"I looked forward to reading this book since I grew up watching many of the SPECTACULARS Esther Williams was in. After reading her memoirs I felt she was, as you say ""full of herself"". There was too much ""back stabbing"" of those that are no longer with us. Sorry, but I would not recommend this book to anyone who might have been an Esther Williams fan."
3,Ultimately a Dissapointment,"I started out in admiration of how tough Esther Williams was. But I kept waiting for her to start having a decent personal life. At first, I thought how sad it was that people were unfeeling and cruel with her. (How is it that every single man she meets, btw, with a few barely mentioned exceptions, are cold, heartless and entirely self-absorbed? An LA thing?) But by the time she started having affairs of her own and marrying the domineering Lamas (she knew what she was getting herself into) I lost all respect or sympathy for her. Even so, I can't help liking her somehow and wishing things had been different. She seems like a friend that lets you down and yet you still want to like her.In a way, it seems like something is missing...almost like you never completely can know or understand her.I did find it very interesting to hear stories about life within MGM."
2,Disappointing,"I love Hollywood biographies. I live for them. I can sit down with a juicy one and read it straight through. The fact is , it took me over a week to get thru this book. I can't quite put my finger on why, but it was disappointing. I found it rather dull, there weren't very many Hollywood stories (maybe they've all been told already), and descriptions of family members seemed superficial. (Ms. Williams' mother and sister, both psychologists, seemed very interesting and insightful but are given extremely short shrift.) And as for that inexplicable marriage to Fernando Lamas, who walked around nude, screamed at her and made her into a slave - hard to see the attraction for 20 years!"
4,A great read! Perfect companion for the plane from NY /LA,"Really loved Ms. Williams' book. Just the right amount of wit, candor and attitude. I'd really like to get to know this woman. How could she stand the Lamas guy? She says it in so many words. ""This was a problem in a package - and an attractive package. I knew there would be a price to pay..."" I heard Ms. Williams on an interview say that men have more difficulty understanding this concept than woman. I think she knows what shes talking about. She's been to the top. I recommend it highly."
1,esther williams in love with esther williams,"good grief it must have been hard to make these movies with out co stars.she told directors how to direct,swimmers how to swim,designed costumes filled and cleaned the pool and still had time to slander a man who loved her. and on top of all this she gave up her 3 children for a guy who had a greatpenis. how lucky we are to have her."
5,Esther Baby,Great book about a great actress. Would recommend this work for any film buff. Good background about her life in films as well as her personal life.
4,Million Dollar Mermaid,"I was rather surprised to find that this is a very interesting book. Certainly not a dull life, Ms Williams tells her story well, very sad in some parts, surprising in others. Very Good Book !!!!!"
3,What a great book,"Since I was a child I have been a fan of Esther Williams; her beauty, her talent, and her swimming ability. Reading her book showed me everything wasn't all that glamourous for her. I like the refreshing way she recalls events in her life and the people she had to deal with. Along with her attitude and how she learned from her mistakes along the way. I felt like she was sitting right next to me telling all these things. It's funny too the way she describes the ""macho"" men in her life. Boy what egos! If half of this is true it still makes interesting reading. She has great recall too. It's a great book and I enjoyed it very much."
5,Million dollar Mermaid debut as movie star,"I loved this movie even as a child.Red Skelton's sketch at the ballet class is not only a riot but a classic act. The story itself is simplistic.Red is left pactically at the altar by afurious Esther Williams. Red follows his wife only to be confronted by the fact that she is teaching at an all girls school.And so the fun begins. Loved Xavier Cugat's numbers andalthough not a fan of Harry James still enjoyed the movie.Ifyou are after an old fashioned 90 minutes of entertainement then I suggest you get Bathing beauty. Oh, it is also Estherfirst staring role(I am enjoying her autobiography at the moment).Recomend it.PS review refers to Bathing beauty movie and her book."
3,A Dog called Fred,"I like Digs. The mermial was good. if you like to do it that you will like this book. If you go to the mall you're bound to find a fish called wanda. ""look at the beautiful clours!"" said mary joe blucasity! WoW! geeeeee willlacker! this tares my hear tares ny heart ta pieces! taaaaaa pieces!"
4,A Fun Read.,"I was looking for something to read while traveling, and remembered hearing some positive comments about this book. It was a really great to read about Hollywood back in it's golden age, with it's ""larger than life"" productions and actors."
1,Disapointed,"I was always a huge fan of Ms Williams, along with a lot of actors of that era. I was looking forward to reading her book. It was well written...but...I was shocked to realize that she is the type of woman who HAS to have a man in her life. Even to the point of choosing Fernando Lamas over her children.I'm not sure that I believe the story about Jeff Chandler in the dress, but who cares. It seems that a lot of other actors and friends dispute Ms. Williams' story. Either way it was very tacky to write about it. Actually, I had a hard time giving it even one star."
1,the million dollar phoney,"Esther Williams has a very high opinion of herself(undeserved).Her films seem insipid now. In the telling of her life she was cruel to people who could not defend themelves,and she comes out smelling like a old fish."
2,Illusions Shattered,"Tawdry. Sleazy. Clueless. One searches for words to describe this tell-all book by one of Hollywood's golden age icons. Esther's career suffered and came to a premature end because the industry and public weren't able to take her seriously as anything but a mermaid. With this incredibly banal book, she has finally proven them right. Rarely have I read of a more wasted life. Her self-destructive marital history alone is enough to make one wonder just what is inside that beautiful head. If you have any fond memories of the lovely young woman who captivated movie audiences during the 40's and 50's, stay away from this dreadful book and retain your illusions."
2,Seem like a good idea at the time?!,"Having been a huge fan of Williams movies I looked forward to reading this book. However, Ms. Williams drives her main point across-that one should never expect too much of their favorite stars. The book seemed more like a way of therapy for Ms Williams, who seemed unable to realize the responbility that her behavior lead to some of her problems. I find it bizzare that in one chapter she can be staring down Mayer and four chapters later cowaring under an oppressive husband. I was disappointed in this biograpghy. While lengthy, it had little depth or writing style, other than as shock vaule. But, if you like books that are short on substance and long on style, by all means read it. My recommendation, check it out from the library"
3,watch,"Looks great and the large dial makes it easy to read.However, as other reviews mentioned its band sure grabs the hairs on my wrist and is too loose.Too bad that after all the negative reviews of the band grabbing hairs, Pulsar hasn't remedied it."
3,Hair puller!,The watch is fine if you have zero hair on your wrist! I had to shave my wrist to prevent painful pulling of my wrist hair! I had no problem with another Pulsar of the same design!
5,Nicer cloth-like top,"I've had my pillowtop queen bed for at least 6 mos, maybe a yr, and I have had no problems. We've blown it up and deflated it several times. Kept it in storage, brought it out months later. It's never leaked.I've also used the normal (non-pillowtop) aerobed. Even though that one has the mattress cover, I could still feel/sense (smell?) the plastic of that bed. The pillowtop is much nicer because it is not plastic on top, and it softer.I like it."
1,Bad buy,"All the mechinics work great, vinyl is sub standard.started cracking around baffles on bottom side after about ten useswill not hold advertised weightdo not buy this product, try another less expensive brand"
1,leaks,it leaks after about 90 days on the pilow top side on seames five already patches ever wear on pillow side only otherwise great bed
4,Rosenberg great but mp3 is INCOMPLETE,"I recently downloaded this book to listen to on a long car trip. It was fantastic...until it abruptly stopped after what would have been the ""third disc."" The CD of this book has FOUR discs, but currently the mp3 only downloads THREE of them. I am still giving this four stars because the content of the cd is wonderful--I felt like I really got an understanding of how and why nonviolent communication works. BUT until Amazon corrects this problem and adds the fourth disc DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS BOOK AS AN MP3!!!"
4,Women in the Bible,This has alot of women that are in the Bible. It does not have alot of information about them. I was expecting more information on the women.
3,documentry,"more of a documentry than anything. Good ideas, however much of the footage was purchased from other ski movies, hence there was a disjointed feeling often seen between segments. The doug coombs segment however was a 5 of 5. That segment made it worth owning."
2,Too abrupt - clips and pretty boring,"How long can you watch folks make some jumps and then others drone through excessive dialogue? After, it is'nt the skiiers minds on display, its their physical prowess and courage no doubt but some of the conversations are really terribly sophomoric and perfect for passing out on the couch, funny that should happen watching a ski movie. The worst part is you see some heavy powder skis, you see the mountain tearing up and coming down right behind the skiier and the film cuts away to some other guy doing overdone backflips somewhere. The elegance and art of skiing is lost and one has this feeling of never really seeing a full run. Youtube posts are much better. A bit of a waste of money and time. Well, the producers made some revenue since I bought a few of these. Verdict: dont bother, go to youtube, search for extreme skiing, ski jumps etc. much better content and fully loaded clips"
3,same old thing.,"Don't get me wrong, the skiing is amazing and the camera angles are perfect, but I'm looking for a DVD with more terrain parks, tricks, etc...I haven't been able to find one yet."
5,Amazing Photography and Story,"The photography all over the world is very beautiful, especially in the full HD quality. All the skiers' different stories are amazing and sometimes quite personal. I couldn't believe some of the stuff these guys have done. The combination of awe inspiring footage and the back stories of the skiers make this a great documentary about the nature and experience of extreme back country skiing."
1,Food for Thought...,"In this book, Mrs. Cheney's fictional vice president, a 59-year-old Republican, dies in office of a heart attack. Her real-life husband, Dick Cheney, is also 59 and has, of course, just survived his fourth heart attack. Is the book cursed? In 1988, when the novel was originally published, Dick Cheney suffered his third heart attack and underwent quadruple bypass surgery. Twelve years later, the novel reappears and Cheney's heart fails again. In addition, There is something else in Mrs. Cheney's book that might give Mr. Cheney pause. When the fictional vice president dies, his scheming, ambitious wife participates in a White House coverup of his death and manages to succeed her late husband as the country's first female vice president."
1,DO NOT waste your time.,"I just bought this book and it really stinks. The cover claims it's ""rollicking"" and that it does for Washington, D.C., what Bonfire of the Vanities did for New York City. I'm not saying the people that wrote these reviews were lying, but I'd sure like to have some of whatever they're imbibing.I had to write this review just to counter the glowing reviews it got here. If you enjoy a well-crafted political thriller, or a comic romp, DO NOT waste your time here.(I gave this book one star because I wasn't allowed to give it minus two stars!)"
3,Lynne's Curse on Dick?,"I find it rather interesting that Mrs. Cheney penned this book in light of her husband's heart disease. And then, Dick suffers another heart attack at the age of 59, just like the character. Are darker forces at play?In all seriousness, this book doesn't deserve all the hype it is getting. It is not a bad book, but it is also not all that good either. It tries to be funny without really accomplishing it. For true, classic political satire try Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita. That book is so much above Lynne Cheney's book that I would cringe to even make a comparison."
1,Unmitigated tripe,"The only reason this book will be a bestseller is because of the current circumstances. It's terrible. The best one can say about it is that one can hope it comes true, as at least it would make the Republicans more interesting people."
5,Its so Pretty,I'm in love with this book. Every time I look at it I want to drop everything and join the fashion industry. It is also a great source of inspiration for anything.
3,decent,"decent but no cigar here, ok canadian hard rock from the late 70s, not bad but nothing really sticks out here, this outfit was more intrested in looking pretty then makin killer hard rock like other candian bands at this time like pat travers, mohagony rush, triumph or helix............."
3,Not so Immortal Drama?,"I had read some of his work in another version and wasn't very impressed.I am holding him to the standards of the really great authorsof his own day. It is said in the beginning that he was killed by the kings dogs( By implications that he had offended the king and they were turned on him?).His tragedy isn't tragic enough, and he rewrites the Trojan war as it pleased him in his age 1000 years later.In many ways he seems a toned down Greek with less passion and blood on stage and more political insinuations.Only about half his plays survive and reading these I realize that they were probably worse?I did find one interesting note in Alcestis that suggest that three days in the grave wasn't a Hebrew superstition, but a Greek one."
4,Best for 4 player fun,"Vigilante 8 is a lot like Twisted Metal, but lacks, of course, the updated graphics in the more recent TM games. However, the 4 player head to head game is the one we always play when we have guests over. The learning curve isn't too steep, the physics are reliable, and overall it makes it competitive and fun for everyone. Also, the cooperative play is a joy. If I bought this game as an indvidual I would give it a so-so rating. But, for me, it's always been hard to find a solidly performing, fun multi-player game that your friends can get into. And, for me, I haven't found a better one than Vigilante 8."
3,"Awkward controls, frustrating level endings","This is a good game, don't get me wrong. But there are annoyances that drag down the entire experience. The controls are a little awkward, and there is no way to edit them. you are stuck with a standard controller configuration, making it a little hard to drive at times.The levels have multiple goals, which need to all be solved. Collecting items and destroying all oponents are two of them. But the level always ends after destroying all oponents, and you fail if you haven't found all the secret items. So you may find yourself searching for hidden items, while constantly under fire. If you defend yourself, the level may end as a failure."
5,awesome!,"The music is awesome and I love the future hover car. I would totally recommend this game if you love twisted metal. the only problem is, IT'S BETTER THAN TWISTED METAL!"
3,for the dreamcast,"Vigialnte 8 would have been a fun game if it weren't for two things: Crazy Taxi and, more importantly, Grand Theft Auto. Basically you have 18 vehicles that run around trying to destroy each other--everything from a motorcycle (with sidecar) to a bus to a moon vehicle to a dump truck (and I found the dump truck to be the best). It really is a fun game, but after playing Crazy Taxi and Grand Theft Auto, it doesn't stack up. The control isn't as great nor is there any story to it. It gets boring rather quickly, but only because I've played similar games that are a lot more fun. I wouldn't go out and buy it, but if you don't have any of the better games, then I'd say keep it. At least until you upgrade you system."
4,''An ok game for the dreamcast'',"This game is fun if you like destruction. The graphics are prety good and the gameplay and frame rate is smooth. There is also a wide range of weapons, Each character has his or hers own unique special weapon, Kinda like Twisted metal 123and4 but better graphics and gameplay. But, This game if not as good as Twisted metal black, It's ok for the dreamcast, And for (the money) it's a good deal."
1,Uncontrollable,"money down the drain. I have no plans to play this title again,and regret having bought it. The graphics are impressive, but I foundthe controllability to be sorely lacking. Total frustration. Rent before buying this one."
2,Don't Buy it,... First of all the play control can get really annoying because it's slippery. Second the graphics are better than the ps and n64 versions but there not even close to Dreamcast's full potential. Third the mission objectives are really pointless. Don't buy it or rent it.
4,Same as the original Vigilante 8 on PS,"In the first ten minutes when I played Vigilante 8 2nd offense, I thought I was playing the original Vigilante 8 on PS. Although the fun factor is still there, I am disappoint with the control on DC version. There are no enough buttons on DC controller to rotate the camera view angle. The graphic is also substadard compare to Soul Calibur. The game looked like was rushed to the market without taking adventage of DC's power. Buttom line: if you have the Vigilante 8 on PS, skip Vigilante 8 2nd on DC."
5,Great Lock,"What is there to say...it is a lock. It seems quite solid, and the mounting attachment is a big plus.The other side is that it is heavy, but again, it is a lock, anyone who wants a light cable lock can expect that their bicycle will go missing before too long."
4,Heavy,"This is heavier than I was expecting, but does a good job. The blade and handle also come apart."
2,A lesser Fraser,"The Reavers is not up to the author's Flashman series -- but, then, what can be. He mixes modern sensabilities in a 17th century setting and too numerous authorial asides that impede the otherwise galloping narrative."
1,A pathetic swansong,"Apparently George MacDonald Fraser died shortly after writing this nonsense. He would have safeguarded his name better by dying before he wrote it. The book is full of irritating anachronisms like some silly, adolescent pretension at parody. He pretends to take umbrage at pedants who complain that Macbeth was not played on stage before 1610 by pointing to some obscure performance of 1590; but ridiculously asserts that that the same highwayman who robbed Oliver Cromwell also robbed Cardinal Richelieu. His historical allusions have no sync, and his irritating allusions to B-grade actors, directors and cinematic cliches add to the unsatisfactory mayhem of a storyteller's mind who is past bothering and disdains his readership. I wish I never started reading this book."
2,pathetic purple prose,"I'm sure there's a story in here somewhere but slogging through the author's artificial folksy speech, overwrought prose, and mindless rambling draws on my nerves and gets tiring fast. It was fun at the introduction, but becomes tedious by the second chapter and near unreadable after that. I just want him to get on with the story. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this."
3,Not Quite What I expected,"The book I received was a British first edition hardback. For some reason I was expecting the cover on the web page and the article I received was nothing like the picture. I am quite happy with what I received as the edition was in a dust jacket that I could remember seeing years ago. I am looking forward to reading the book as a companion to ""Stolen Journey"" by Oliver Phillpot who was one of the original Wooden Horse escapees!"
1,Disapointment,I am a Great Fan of Fraser and loved his Flashman series.All of his fans were waiting in high anticipation for his next Flashman book.I was expecting it to be about Flashman and his adventures in Mexico that he refered to in a couple of other stories.The Reavers was a Big let down in so many ways.Other reviewers have compaired it to Pyrats.Pyrats was a pretty straight foreward story with a little interjection by Fraser.The Reavers had a story if you took the time to dig it out from Frasers Ramblings.Some of the sentences did not make sense to me and I had a hard time following the story.A lot of the words I had to look up to find out there meaning.This is the only book by fraser I could not finish.It was more of a chore than a pleasure.I feel very bad that such a great writer had to finish his career with Garbage like this.Fraser created Flashman and then Flashman Created Fraser.To bad he did not go out with a Flash.
1,Journey Beyond Science,"Writing with all of the professionalism and sophistication of a gum snapping, smart aleck teenager, Jeffrey Klugar can be added to the growing list of those ""dumbing down"" science. Journey Beyond Selene could have been an intelligent, fast paced story of unmanned space exploration, self-propelled by the incredible and intriguing nature of the raw subject matter. Instead, Kluger's silly off-track comments and hyperbole make the reading slow and distracting. The appendix is weak. There isn't even a single photograph or drawing of any of the craft or instruments discussed. The editor should be horse whipped."
4,Sex and death in the not-so-Good Old Days,"Geary does what might be called documentary graphic novels, the best known of which is his series of true crime stories. This one is set in Glasgow in the late 1850s and involves an overly-romantic young gentleman and the young-ish daughter of a prominent architect who carry on a clandestine love affair -- until Madeleine gets tired of the whole thing, takes up with a man her father approves of, and then has to keep her paramour from outing her. Enter arsenic. The ex-boyfriend dies in great pain, the government brings murder charges, and a trial ensues. Even though their styles are nothing at all alike, Geary always reminds me of Edward Gorey -- the sly depiction of violence, the sense of inevitability, the decorous text. This is great stuff."
2,condition very bad,I know I bought a used book but I was expecting at least fair condition. While reading the book has just started crumbling away. I didn't return it because of the hassle. I guess that's what this company's counting on.
2,OK for a super-low-cost socket set,"Well, you get what you pay for with this set.The PLUS: there are a wide range of socket sizes; for instance: 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5mm sockets. Nearly all the sockets are 6-point, which is good considering they are probably not made of the highest-quality steel.The NEGATIVE: overall cheezy quality; relatively few 3/8""-drive sockets...most of the sockets are 1/4""-drive. For instance, the smallest 3/8""-drive sockets are 12mm and 7/16th"".Probably an ideal homeowner set if you need a wide range of sizes and you never are involved with high-torque applications.2-1-13 UpdateFirst time I used the ratchet, it broke. In a low-torque application, the ratcheting teeth seem to have ripped out. The ratchet is now scrap metal. It was probably defective...your results may vary.I down-graded to two stars. I would suggest everyone avoid this set."
5,Nice copy,"I collect the Bullitens,circulars and professional papers on the state of Georgia. This purchase was nice addition to the collection of which I'm always searching the Internet for. Especially the ones that are out of print. Usually library copies are in the best condition, because it 's so specialized. Always on the lookout to find nice copies and this was in good condition. Seller was prompt and reasonably priced."
4,I guess this works,Hard to tell if it's helping me or not. I can't complain though unless I complain about the size of the gel caps. Quite large.
1,I keep burping old fish,I had heard rumors to be careful which Omega supplement you buy because of the fish taste. Now I know exactly what they are talking about. The fish burps start almost immediately and last for hours. I'm tossing it and going back to flax only omega supplements.
4,Seems like what I've been looking for.,"I had ordered this product about a month before it finally arrived, so I actually forgot all about it. I was going to send it back, as I was pretty upset with the amount of time it took to receive it, but decided to go ahead and give it a try. So far, it is a good product, and I do notice a difference in how I feel taking it. I recommend the product, but not the supplier."
4,Exactly what I needed,"These Omega 3/6/9 gels are great. I have had no fishy burps while taking them. They are on the large side, but still easy to swallow because of the smooth coating. I also like how they look, as a clear pill with an amber tint. I like the simple/plain packaging and easy open lid. Not much else to say, its a great product, a supplement that I need and I've had a very good experience with it."
3,Meh...,"Honestly, it is a good quality product but I still get the fish burps. Not as bad as some, but still."
1,Broke on my trip across country,"I used the rack on a trip across the USA. The rack had about 30-35 pounds total and made it from San Fran to the middle of the country before breaking. A bike shop found me another one so I could continue, and it broke again 2 states later in the same spot where a weld is located. I will not buy this again because it will not hold the advertised weight."
2,absolutely disappointed,"Though I have already known this book is not good , there is only one kind of published book about juniper in china : The complete reference. key. The only worth reading chapter is chapter 8 : Routing Information Protocol. I wonder that how canthis book was named ""complete reference "" without IPv6 and Multicast . haha"
4,A lot of Fun,If you open the book on each page to the left you will find some kind of instruction (draw a cd case for your band) and gives an example. To the right they have a blank black page for you to draw your idea. At the back you'll find plain (not scratch art) paper to sketch on.
4,"Sorry Northword, you didn't read far enough","There are notes for each page of designs detailing where the item was found and to what tribe they belong. There are also notes at the bottom of each ""design"" page. The information IS here."
4,North American Indian Designs,I do gourd pyrography and wanted a source of Indian designs to use in my pyrography. This book contains a nice selection and each group of designs includes an explaination of the design and when it was used.
2,Limited use,"Not particularly attractive drawings. The designs are devoid of context. Many are sacred and culturally sensitive; legally, I don't see how particular tribes' intellectual property / cultural patrimony can be released as copyright-free images by an unrelated party."
3,.,"I was amazed to find anything of Fletcher's in print. He is, I believe, a much underrated author. And as much as I enjoy his mysteries, I think his historical fiction, such as At the Blue Bell Inn, is better-written"
3,Not for cross stich,"This book is simple to read with big color charts. However it is not really suited for cross stich, it would be much more helpful to those interested in beading ect. If you want to do Indain cross stich please look for another book."
2,Bonsai,"Tree's did not last for a year in the Atlanta, GA climate. Was watered and fertilized properly, as per directions, but didn't last a winter."
5,My son loves it -- we now have 3!,"This was a ""book buddy"" we checked out from the library. My son loved it so much that I had to go online to buy him one he could have permanently. Threatening to take ""Doby"" away at night was the only way we could keep him in bed, so when Doby got lost, we had to order a 2nd one from Amazon. Thank goodness it's only $5! Later, we found another Doby at a garage sale for about 10 cents--he was grimy, but made it through the washer/dryer in a pillowcase and came out good as new!"
5,"Articulate, insightful","Shinzen Young has produced a valuable tool for anyone suffering from pain. The meditations take you to the center of your painfor your evaluation and awakening. Pain can sometimes be a teacher. When lessons are learned, pain moves on. Young is clearly a masteron this subject and his work has reached thousands of brave people who are willing to take a powerful step in regard to their pain issues.I bought this as download. The sound is perfect. Young has a calm clear voice. Worth investigation."
5,A very nice watch,"I bought this as a gift. If you are looking for a watch with that hard to find expansion band, this is a great one. The numbers are easy to read and it has a nice ""feel"" to it, seems it would be very comfortable to wear, feels high quality. I was concerned that the face would be too white but it has a very slight greyish tint to it, so it's a toned down white."
5,Great Value......,"Good quality watch for the price. I only wish the numbers were a little darker to make it easier to read by these tired old eyes. Other than that, a perfect watch."
5,The food of France - A food lover's journey,After a recent trip to France I decided that I would like to prepare some of the local fare. I had heard about this book from a friend of mine and decided to try it. I have prepared many of the recipes that I had tried in France and am really pleased with their authenticity. The book is easy to use and understand.
5,Beautiful,"This collection caught my attention a while back while browsing in a store. I picked `The Food of Spain' and started to look through it. After getting it home and really looking through it, I instantly loved it. I went online to see if there were any more books in the collection and sure enough there were. These books are presented beautifully and are overall fun and exciting to read. A great 'coffee table' type book. Beautiful pictures and great explanations. The recipes are very classic. Loved it so much I bought a couple of other books from `The Food of _____"" collection. A must have if you are looking into getting a cookbook on food from a specific location. Also would recommend `The Food of Spain"" and ""The Food of Italy"". Love them just as much as this one."
2,Why change Herb's low G tuning???,"What makes the classic Herb Ohta sound? His Low G tuning along with his mastery of melody. Why would anyone change to a high G tuning just because ""most people play that way"". If I wanted to play like most people, I would still be strumming Tiny Tim stuff. The reason people buy this book, is to learn how to play like Mr. Ohta. The high G ruins the whole experience. I just hope Herb got a decent cut of the profits from Jumpin Jim. Like Jim says Herb pioneered the low G tuning."
2,not what i expected,"this book is like a vocal edition book. it is not finger soloing arrangements that i was expecting. the versions are cut like what u would find in a ""fake"" book. to me, it's a waste of money. i have a free uke solo arrangement that i got off of youtube that herb ohta arranged full of orchestra chords for the single player. wish i could send it back"
2,"Nice looking, but poorly written book","I was dissappointed to read this book. First, I wondered, who is going to read this? It's too long for younger readers, and its a picture book, so older children will never pick it up. The narrative is poorly written and lacks cohesiveness. Based on reviews, I thought it would be terrific, but I was very dissappointed."
1,upset Michael Jackson Fan,I was very disappointed because I ordered the product and the next day I received an e-mail stating I was not receiving my orderd due to overwhelming demand. I can't rate a product I never got!!
4,A good collection of some of his best,"I really liked this DVD. It was a good price, and had a good collection of some awesome music videos. The only reason I gave it four stars, is because there were a couple good videos that were left out, but that's why you buy the other volumes.The videos showed on this DVD however, were really great. They are quality videos to watch whenever. My favorites are of course the most popular, Thriller, Bad, and Black and White. I was a little disapointed that there wasn't much moonwalking, but it really showed Michael at some of the good times of his life. He was so talented."
1,Show me the Money!!,Yes! The songs are great; but if you are one of the 46 million people who purchased Thriller and the millions of other people who bought MJs other discs then this is really not for you. When a superstar puts out a no-frills CD; something is wrong. MJ could have mixed this togeter in his basement one night in twenty minutes.
5,The Godfather of Music Video,great collection of Videos from the Man who could make you GLide while chilling. Michael Jackson music videos back in the day where Must see Tv. He was a One Man CNN. all of the classics are here. His videos told storys&made you think. His Footwork is standard that every Artist that came after him had to learn. this is a Must have for anybody who is just starting out there MJ Video Collection. these Videos are cool for partying to.I Be Moonwalking with my Kool-Aid in my hands.
5,Michael Jackson,"Bought as a present and even though it came after Christmas was still a great purchase, love the dvd. Awesome!!!"
2,That's it??,"First of all, where's Smooth Criminal? The best of all MJ's videos was disfigured, distorted, ripped off... I just bought the DVD because of that masterpiece of magical dancing! It was just a simple thing to do: getting that part out of the Moonwalker movie and injecting into this DVD! What have they done?!! Second, why not all the videos? Should we still depend on VHS old rags? Third, if not all the videos, at least the best ones, right? So where's ""Ghost""? That is a masterpiece! Where's ""Another Part of Me""? That one is also amazing. They even play it on a huge screen in Disneyland. Where's the final part of ""Black or White"" (the one he changes into a panther and dances in a dark street)? At least five minutes were cut out!! That's why it deserves only two stars. We, old fans, deserved a little more."
3,The quality of the DVD,"The Dvd has excellent videos of Micahel Jackson, but after a few times of watching it freezes up on the Earth Song, plays good in the beginning but once it gets there I can't watch anymore of the videos. I'm not happy with this Dvd, whoever made this is a poor quality DVD. Don't want my money back just another DVD."
5,Great Dvd Of Michael Jackson,This was so very worth waiting for and so great for my collection of Micheal`s items I have 1 to watch and 1 not opened.
3,what happened to the full versions of these films?,"okay forget about the full versions! i already OWN all of these films. what should've been there if i was the one who was directing the production of this dvd, was the live versions of these songs dug up from his past footage from his best concert performances. that would have made it alot better!!! i dont even have to take a survey and i know people would have rather seen that instead of these chopped up master peices."
3,For folks who merely want their appetites whetted.,"There ain't really nothing wrong with appetite whetting, andthese are good videos, that's true. But this doesn't have the longer versions of some jams (Black and White, f'instance) and I'm surprised it did not have Scream on it. But the title of the production is called Number Ones, right? If you really want to be stunned with how some the longer forms and rare videos are get the productions History Vol II and Dangerous-the short films Videos. What I think they should produce--someone, somewhere--is the DVD production of the Dangerous Tour they did in the 90's and a vid production of Ghosts. However, this product overall is ok."
5,LOVED IT,"I really enjoyed this dvd. The only problem was Smooth Criminal, I didn't really liked what they did to it. Smooth Criminal has a lot of his dancing and it looked liked they just fast forward through the whole dance routine. Why did I rate it a 5, because I just love Michael Jackson."
4,Michael Is the Man!,"This is my second MJ DVD to own, my first purchase was History on Film II, and i loved that one. This one is a great addition to my collection! I especially love the long edition of You Rock My World. And any MJ fan would def. want to pick up this DVD, support MJ and get some of your favorite classic songs!!!!!!"
5,michael's true fan,"Number OnesMichael Jackson - Video Greatest Hits - HIStoryMichael Jackson - History on Film, Vol. 2Michael Jackson - Dangerous: The Short FilmsMichael Jackson - Mega boxIF YOU ARE A TRUE MICHAEL JACKSON FAN THESE DVD'S ARE FOR YOU I HAVE PURCHASED THESE VIDEOS FROM AMAZON.COM AND I LOVE THEM I RECENTLY PURCHASED MICHAEL JACKSON MOONWALKER AND I LOVE MICHAEL AND IF YOU ARE A FAN PURCHASE THES ITEMS BECAUSE MICHAEL IS AT HIS BEST."
3,A perfunctory bare bones compilation,I'm not a huge fan of MJ; but I enjoyed his body of work over his lifetime. If you're looking for his music videos and not a bunch of commentaries and fluff this DVD should serve you well.
3,KING OF POP DOES IT AGAIN!,"""Number Ones"" was good but lacked a little in being creative. ""HIStory on Film vol II"" was incredible and so was ""Dangerous the Short Films."" However on this one there are no special live performances, commercials, or interviews. Compared to the rest of the DVD world it was just missing a few things. Plus you don't get the 14 minute video of ""You Rock My World"", the long unedited version of ""Black or White"", and I don't like the fast paced version ""Smooth Criminal."" If you are a big fan or would like to see some of his newer videos I would buy this DVD. Although if you want a good DVD on Michael Jackson I would purchase ""HIStory on Film vol II."" I only bought it so I could get the last two videos and have easy access to each video instead of fast forwarding to them on the tapes I already own"
4,This si replacement handle and it's working well,"I bought this as replacement for my existing soldering station. Downside is that my temperature regulation electronics is now inaccurate since temperature sensor is not calibrated, but if I put temperature to 480 I get 350 degrees from the iron. Otherwise it works now more than one year without any problems"
3,Not the dependability I expected from Forschner.,"First off let me state by saying this: Not everything that comes from another country makes it top quality. I was impressed when this set came in it's pretty case in the mail. It comes with all the basic garnishing equipment you could need including a vegetable peeler which is no doubt the one you will use the most. When I took this out to use on some carrots I found myself fighting to peel the carrot. I thought that I must be using the wrong side but, alas, I wasn't. The butter curler, melon baller and everything appears to wok just fine."
5,"An original, stimulating, challenging and beautiful book","I finished reading Sacred Mountains a couple of months ago, but it won't let me go! It keeps challenging me. It keeps pushing me to think more deeply about my feelings and instincts toward mountains. And I like that. Any book that refuses to let go of its reader has got to be worth talking about, which is why I wanted to offer this testimony. This is a truly great book."
1,Useless,I have 2 of the full size massage canes and love them. I bought this one for traveling. It is completely useless because of it's small size and weird knob. I'm 170 lbs and this thing won't fit around my side to get to my back. It might work on a 100 lb woman but that's about it.I'm going to buy a full size one and cut it down to take with me.
2,Inferior to it's predecessor...,"The Back buddy, the big, blue, s-shaped device, which I own, is a sturdy device that does not give to pressure. I've used it nearly two years now and it's amazing. A staple of my daily activities.This back buddy mini is made of a much shoddier, much weaker plastic that widens upon pressure, right out of the box. Imagine trying to apply pressure to a knot in your neck or back with a slightly flimsy piece of plastic... Exactly.I bought this as a gift, and I regret it. It isn't completely worthless, but comparing it to the deluxe model isn't even a contest. If you have the money, get the back buddy. You'll be grateful."
3,Ok,I agree with the previous reviewer. Why did they make the little knobby end pointed? It kind of hurts where as the rounded one feels better. I can't see any reason why they would do this on this model. I like that it's small enough to use sitting at my desk. I keep it nearby.
3,Body Back Buddy is pretty good,"It is pretty good for what it does. I wish the tip was no so pointy. I will definitely purchase other items like this, I think I need more than just the ""mini"" - but it is good for a first purchase."
4,Very Handy Little Helper,"I bought this little guy for use on my back---I have a huge amount of muscle tightness, cramping, etc., and massages really help. This tool is so handy---it's small enough for me to carry in my tote everywhere. The only drawback is that the knob that does the massaging is pointed which can be a little too intense for certain areas. I wish the designers would make one this size with a rounded knob. But another plus---the other end is a back-scratcher!"
1,Worthless- except as a backscratcher,"This is absolutely the worst massage product I have ever experienced. The knob is sharp and uncomfortable. The material is not sturdy enough to actually apply pressure to a trigger point; instead, it bends and feels like it is going to snap in half. I recently tried out a full size Theracane and I will be getting one of those. I will say, this has a backscratcher on one end and that is delightful except that you can buy a backscratcher at basically any gas station near a major highway.Also, mine came with a sticker of San Francisco on it which makes me think it is a cheap Chinese import (which might explain the quality) instead of being a helpful therapeutic device."
2,Too Flimsy - Get a Theracane instead,"I have a Theracane, which I absolutely love (for my neck and shoulders), but I wanted something smaller for travel. This one is a good size, but it's too flimsy (bendable plastic) to get enough pressure. Also, unlike the Theracane, the tip is pointy and a little sharp instead of being rounded and pain-free. P.S. It's flesh-colored, so you're bound to get some phallic jokes too!"
2,"OK for travel, but only barely so...","I get huge relief from theThera Cane Massagerand have recommended it to several friends who have thanked me for the recommendation because they, too, are so pleased with it. But, the Thera Cane was too big and too heavy to add to my suitcase on a cruise where the air lines' baggage limit was 50#, and I had lots of other stuff that I needed to pack. So, I bought the Body Back Buddy, Mini. With a little bit of work, I could indeed reach some trigger points near my lumbar spine and hips, but I could not in any way come close to the degree of relief that I got with the Thera Cane. On the other hand, the Body Back Buddy, Mini was light-weight and low-priced, and it fit comfortably into one of the front pockets of my suitcase, so for my trip it was better than nothing...but not a whole lot better."
2,"Ineffective, OK as back scratcher",The tool bends too much and there is no sufficient leverage for it to be effective for me. My wife commented that it looks like it broke and is missing the lower part... That's where the scratcher is... Get Back Buddy instead [...]. That's a wonderful tool.
2,Original Back Buddy is Better,"I have the original back buddy, so I had high hopes for the mini as well to be used at the office..etc. Upon receiving it, I was a bit disappointed as to how flimsy it feels and that the curve portion and nub are at an awkward angle for me to use. may be my personal preference, but i like to really crank down on my knots, and with this being flimsy (flexing when i dig in to my knots) and the awkward nub, I was not impressed with the mini. Works well with people who like lighter pressure, but look else where if you use a lot of pressure."
2,I was thinking it was the backnobber 2,I was hoping it was a part of backnobber2 . I was very disappointed.Do you have the backnobber 2 or other product?
3,prefer the Back Buddy Jr,"The mini is ok to take to work, on a plane, etc but it has a point on the end that, to me, prohibits deep use in the muscle. The Back Buddy Jr has rounded ends that massage the muscle more. The pointed end on the mini is rather painful. The knots in my muscle are not very deep because I am a smaller size...if that helps. But, the mini did come as a set with the Jr at the time of purchase so I can't complain(-; A friend of mine said it was a good shoulder scratcher."
2,medical terminology,"I purchased this book as used, and the seller did'nt mention the pages that were missing and the writing in the book. I knew that it was going to have wear and tear but the seller should have mentioned all the things wrong with the book."
5,Used books are great,"This book that I purchased was exactly what I needed for my class, and it is very well written as to how it teaches the tough words of the medical world."
4,I like this book!,This is a great book; it gives you everything you need to get the foundation for any medical career. Its self explanatory and it works.
2,Somewhat functional,"This product works somewhat. It would certainly work well with SRAM rotary shifters. Indexed front shifting, especially Shimano, will not succeed. In addition to being difficult to shift onto, it is also difficult to shift from--to the tune of the chain frequently flying right off down to bottom bracket land and the pedals just spinning freely, or just totally jamming up (called chainsuck).However, for some people, this particular size is greatly wanted. Just think twice about this brand.Similar products tried: TA, with none of the above problems and twice the price."
2,Reading Blind!,The book's value is severly compromised by the lack of maps. It is impossible to follow the progress of the war and to understand exactly what is going on. I was so frustrated that I had to pull out an atlas and try to pinpoint the areas that the author was refering to. In the end I just gave up and the book has been gathering dust in my library ever since.
2,"too many trees, too little forest","Gilbert covers the War on all fronts, but his interpretation of the material is either weak or non-existent. He devotes as much space to a pigeon receiving a medal as he does to Foch. Some analysis of the social, political, & above all the technology & science of the War would have been helpful in understanding the carnage. He portrays the War in a vacuum. Gilbert seems unsure of his audience. Historians looking for explanation would not be satisfied. The general public would be hard pressed to find a theme, other than slaughter, & consequently would be wading through a repetitious mass of facts with only the names of the battles changing. The book is very helpful for collectors of ancedotes and perhaps trivia. A few more maps of the battlefields would have been handy. Tuchman, & even Taylor, give a far more challenging picture."
3,"Broad based, good reference, dry.","This is a sweeping, in-depth presentation of the whole conflict. Recommended as a starting point for further reading.Another plus is that Gilbert includes many personal tales (letters, interviews) from many of the participants.There are two problems I had with the book, however. For one, I feel that Gilbert tended to pull punches. There where several cases where he went a little easy on the governments and high commands (on all sides), who made many bad choices that lengthened the war. Perhaps the fact the he was Churchill's official biographer hampered his objectivity.The other problem is that the author could have taken the time for one more rewrite. In many places, his ability to convey the drama or significance of an event failed to do it justice.I recommend Tuchman's `Guns of August'."
2,a mediocre treatise of a key historic even,"Gilbert's book tries to hard to be all things to all readers. He never quite hits the mark. An over abundance of research is presented throughout with little concern to larg issues.Gilbert spends far too much time concerned with minor players and as a result, trivializes their sacrifice.The large questions at the strategic and operational level are not thoroughly explored in favor of a tedious exploration that seems to recount the delivery of each shell and bullet.Too see a history with tactical explanation done correctly I direct you to ""Delivered FroM Evil"" by Robert Leckie (WWII)"
3,The WW1 guide of Dead Poets and Philosophers,"An Interesting read though far from complete. The book has an interesting turn in reporting ad nauseum the poets, philosophers,and pacifists that were involved in the war. A touch more perspective on the dough boy would have been a relief.The details of the events are nice. Perspective of the horrors of war makes one wince at how the world could participate in a war of this magnitude. So, there is some redeeming value to the text.Unfortunately, the run of the text tends to jump back and forth and has a slightly disruptive style. Other than the largest theatres, you tend to lose track of what was happening. If this were written in sections about the separate theatres it may have been easier to read.Overall, use Keegan for the best texts on the Great War. Use this book for perspectives on the horrors."
4,"A long, hard slog","I selected this book because I have never read a history of WWI before. It is a bit of a slog because Gilbert seems to have written the book out of a nearly infinite series of personal accounts and snippets of everyday life in the war. Those views are good and valuable, but i find myself longing for more political content on the forces that instigated and drove the conflict.I will say one thing - this book makes it clear that A LOT has changed in 100 years. At the beginning of the 20th Century nations exerted their interests unapologetically. Of course that led to a disaster of unprecedented proportions. Still it is quite a contrast to the nearly surgical method of executing a war these days."
3,beastly germans saintly brits!,Having read all the reviews previously written very diverserange of views.Its that kind of book.You either love it orhate it.Most of the soldiers certainly on the commonwealthside were working class.However the author gives a disproportionate[did I spell that correctly?]amount of quotes to poets and effeteyoung things.Also yes a very British viewpoint.Very little coverageof the war in Africa.I know it was a sideshow but not even a map.Well written undoubtedly and easy to read but somehow unsatisfactory.
2,"If it's as biased as this book, it isn't history","Glad I borrowed this one at the library first...This book is a chock full of value-judgements by a biased ""historian"". Great book if you enjoy propaganda. Lots of facts intermingled almost imperceptibly with anti-Axis, pro-Entente rhetoric. Reads as if it were written in the 1920s by an embittered veteran rather than by a modern-day ""distinguished historian."""
3,Not for pleasure reading- too much stuff!,"The First World War was obviously, the first world war. There were a lot of new types of weapons, and new places to etch onto the glass of history, and new names to learn. This book tries to accomplish the task of explaining the who, why, when, and where, but is overwhelming in its attempt to cover everything. Obviously, this is not possible to cover every aspect and every unit, but what results is a very comprehensive effort to be used as an authoritative reference source. I could never imagine assigning this book in class- it would be far too much to process in a short time. This is a good book, though, and should answer near any question that a reader may have regarding the Great War."
1,Read something else!,"I read numerous histories and believed the cover hype about this being an excellent book. It isn't. It is as simple as this, if you want to believe the lies that the British and French General Staffs were telling their governments and the people, then this book is replete with them. However, if you wish to read the historical facts about World War 1, then you should read one that contains actual facts rather than the opinions of this author.whale"
2,An Apologist's Tale of WWI,"I was extremely disappointed with Martin Gilbert's The First World War: A Complete History. Gilbert gives very short shrift to the Central Power's perspective. Gilbert painstakingly documents every instance of German excess in Belgium while ignoring the effect of the Allied Blockade, resulting in the ""Turnip Winter"" of 1917. While it is important to document the savage brutality of trench warfare, the British war poets quoted by Gilbert cannot claim to speak for the majority of combatants on either side. This work falls quite short of being the complete history of WWI."
5,A Masterpiece,"Having followed Dyer's other research, I think that this is a theoretically elegant piece of work. He builds further on his pieces in SMJ (with Singh from Wharton) and AMR and illustrates the concepts of relationship-based assets in firm networks. The running exemplar has he uses (Toyota) illustrates his theoretical arguments quite elonquently. The book also highlights the limitations of his concept of collaborative advantage, and his closing chapter illustrates how cultural differences (here with Benz) can keep this strategy from becoming reality. This book is not for folks looking for cut-out recipies. This book is a MUST for researchers and managers who like to think instead of searching for cookbooks! The concluding chapter is a gem because it highlights our gaps in knowledge. This is an excellent book, and having read Dyer's other works, it's high quality comes as very little surprise. Buy, own, read, reread, and profusely highlight your own copy! VERY highly recommended."
5,My reference copy,"I have already read and reviewed this book but then as a kindle ebook. I found it so good that I wanted the dead tree version for my library. Also, the kindle version has images but they are pretty much useless as its almost impossible to see anything there. If you have not read it then I can really recommend it. This dead tree version of the book was used but in very good shape. Cover was somewhat torn on the back and I don't think that was mentioned when I bought it (minus one star) but I am very happy with the quality in all other respects."
4,it's not the truth,"I was fascinated by this book so I did some research and found that all of the subs that he said that he commanded had either been destroyed before haveing been completed,or simple didn't list him as commanding.It's a great book and I think he knows alot about German subs,but I couldn't find supporting evidance SORRY!"
4,Finsihed it craving for more!,"Too short! I'm not that fast of a reader but I ate this book in a week. Werner did a great job at narrating his experience and he is able to grip the reader to the story, at no point did I get bored, just kept on reading. One book I really recommend.My only critcism is that I felt the book was kind of a summary of his experiences,, it went strait to the point. I felt he could have expanded on some experiences, been a little more dramatic. Yep forget drama in this book, if you want to read about sailors going beserk during attacks or the strains and pressures they felt, forget about it, Werner avoids any passion."
4,An eye opener,A glimpse into the life of U-boat sailor. I came away impressed by the discipline required of these men just to survive.
5,An outstanding and powerful personal account.,This book is an excellent personal journey through the war in the Atlantic as viewed from the other side. It is both an emotional account of an individual's experiences fighting at sea as well as a valuable history of the u-boat war.
4,Meet Mr. Lucky Uboat Commander,"I found this tale of undersea warfare very exciting and full of precarious situations that he barely escapes from. However there are so many that this guy is the luckiest guy in the world. Regardless, it is an exciting tale, embellished or not. The back and forth with the radar warfare was interesting. The ending has the main character repeatedly escaping from prison camps so many times I found it unbelievable. But it did make the allies seem like vengeful conquerors. We don't hear about that side of the story in America. Overall I would recommend this read if you like WW2 submarine yarns."
4,This is a good read,"Any history buff will enjoy this book, well written . The old U boats had a certain mystique; even though they were dangerous and often unsafe to serve in they had prestige, sailors were eager to serve in the u boat service. Iron coffins tells about the danger, glory and horror of warfare in the North Sea and elsewhere."
4,It give you a good feel of what it was like in the U-boats,It is quite a good account of what it was like to be in the u-boats. I did not find it quite as griping as many of the other reviews but I think its very good.
5,"The best and most real of any book on the war, I have read.","Although it has been almost twenty years since I first read the book it hasn't lost any of its original excitement for this reader. It is a collecter and hopefully generations will continue to enjoy the brutal reality that is displayed in it. It is truely exciting and well written, I hope Werner has seen the success of his efforts writing about this horrible time in history. If you haven't seen ""Das Boot"", it's a must."
3,repeatative,"The book proports to be an accurate account of the life of a U Boat Commander.The first half of the read is very interesting.The second half becomes more of the first.Go out on a mission, many other U Boats are sunk, I survived."
3,"Captivating, but partly fiction","This account is similar to Das Boot. Herbert A. Werner served in German U-boats and commanded three.The book is filled with exact details - precise times, weather, number of ships sunk, attack descriptions, etc. Much too detailed to have been written from memory. There are few references or sources attributed.It turns out that many details have been embellished. For example, in one patrol, 30,000 tons are said to have been sunk - actual records show that it was 7,000 tons. There are many other such discrepancies, mostly embellishments.Herbert A. Werner most certainly was a real U-boat commander. But his post-war bio is very slim - no other writings, no info on whether he is alive, no interviews, etc. I wonder if this book was written by a ghost writer?Disclosure: I served in the U.S. Navy and spent some time in submarines."
3,What Canadian war effort ?,"I was a bit biased about the view from the other side. I was told that the Germans considered anything on this side of the Atlantic to be American, such as Newfoundland,Nova Scotia,Canadian destroyers & Corvettes,etc...all American apparently. Despite most of the warships in the North Atlantic (after 1942) being Canadian, the Germans rebadged them as American. I guess they found some common ground with America after all. I just couldn't identify with the story. The books about the Tang, Wahoo, etc were far more entertaining. Anyway, still not a bad book."
5,Iron Coffins is Fantastic,"I did some research on German U-Boats prior to ordering this book and have a hardback in excellant condition. It is wonderful, without going into great detail all I can say is this is very well written, keeps the attention of the reader and you keep turning page after page wanting to find out what is going to happen. If you enjoy submarine warfare from the German side, please read, it is well worth it."
5,Another Option,"A riveting account, as so many others have noted here. Just a heads-up for those of you who read German: you can get the original version of Iron Coffins (Die eisernen Särge) together with Wolfgang's Hirschfeld's U-boat memoir, Feindfahrten, in one convenient paperback volume from Amazon.de. It includes quite a few photos and illustrations, too."
5,Gripping!,This book pulled me in and would not let go. I read it almost nonstop until It was done. Great historical account from the German perspective. Well written but not complicated. This is one worth reading!
5,Enrique Chia - Ritmos De Mi Cuba,I just love everything he does! Chia can do no wrong and this records is just another proof of that. The music is great - makes you nostalgic and makes you want to dance. It's wonderful.
5,WatchNight,I bought this booklet to use at my church Christmas pageant. It was a last minute purchase and I was amazed how quickly it got to me. Had it been a few days later I wouldn't have had need of it. Thank you to Amazon and the seller for their attention to customer service. (PS: The pageant went beautifully!!)
3,Cheeseball Meets Screwball Comedy,"The quality of the packaging is fine, the discs play clear and there is a way to navigate through the episodes and chapters within the episodes.There is special features that I haven't watched yet but seem to be good. The show is super saccharine-y by today's standards but it still has entertainment value, I think.It's nice to see a couple and their adult male ex-con servant create such a cohesive family.I don't give it a strong recommendation, but I do recommend it.:) Be guilty. Enjoy it."
3,Gary Hoyt,The story material in Hart/Hart is probably pretty well dated by now. The premise behind the Harts is wealth with the constant show of high priced material objects.In its day H/H fit into the everyday lives of where our society was at that time.
2,Poor writing and unrealistic storylines,"Sorry to rain on the parade. Most of the episodes are just plain dumb, consisting of poor writing and dumb plots. If you want to watch a witty, sexy, and clever series like this (only much better), check out Remington Steele with Pierce Brosnan and Stephanie Zimbalist...much MUCH better. I don't like giving poor reviews but this is very deserving."
3,Not what I remember,I thought I had found another old show that I once liked but it was cheesy and disappointing. Guess my memory built it up more than it ever was.
5,Rarely matched,"This show is one of the all-time classics, bringing suspense, action, exotic places, and comedy all in one, as well as providing great acting and witty dialogue. For the price I paid, my only regret was that I didn't have more people to purchase it for, as it was one of the truly great bargains. Will be getting Season 2 and hoping that the other seasons come out on DVD soon."
5,hart to hart season 1,I was very pleased with amozon packaging of this item that means alot to me. The show was GREAT and I reconmend this to anyone of all ages.
4,Schmultz...but I liked it,"I did assume that purchasers of this DVD are real Hart to Hart fans. I am. My only disappointment was with the titles. Instead of using the titles from the first years, which I liked, ie..""woman who really takes care of herself...and when they met it was murder"" they used the more PC update from the last years which were always lame. In addtion this later intro misses the photomontage of the first titles which I liked. If SONY is going to give us these episodes I wish they wouldn't tamper with the originals as aired."
5,It's About Time!!,"Hurry up with seasons 2-5!! I can't wait 4 months in between seasons. This was too long in the making...but it's wonderful to be able to get my H2H fix anytime I want by popping in one of these great DVDs. I have enjoyed sharing the Harts with my children...there's hardly any decent ""family"" viewing on t.v. anymore. I hope the Hart to Hart movies from the 90's will be available on DVD at some point as well. On a side note, my husband and I invented a new drinking game to play while watching these great old episodes...every time they day ""Darling,"" it's time to chug. Kinda like the days of playing ""Hi, Bob!"" from the old Bob Newhart show (which would be great on DVD as well)."
5,Powers to be are Mean to fans.,"This is not really a review for Hart to Hart which I loved then and still do. This is the annoying habit studios have of A) Splitting a season in two volumes and thus cutting their own throats(ie poor sales) for GREED.B) Hart to hart, Kojak, Mccloud, Diagnosis murder,Burkes Law,Streets of San Francisco,Jake and the Fatman,Early Edition ??????? where are THE SEASONS?????? Why bother to release new shows when fans are waiting to complete their library.Anyone else feels the same???? MF"
4,Great Survey of the Formative Period of France,"Highly recommend this work, especially if you want to get the broad overview with not an inconsiderable amount of detail as well on the rise of France. The author makes great use of his chapter divisions that examines the pertinent aspects of French social, economic, religious, political, and military life. But he doesn't overburden the reader with too much detail.The reader will certainly note the correlation between population growth, economic stagnation, taxation, political chaos and order, and incessant warfare that culminated in the absolute rule of Louis XIV, which was not always that absolute.The presentation is cogent, and direct. Graphs assist the author to highlight trends and relationships without trying to imply too much. My only criticism is the persistence to use French terms that are not defined nor translated. The 1977 edition has a glossary that is indispensible.Still, overall, an worthwhile educational and entertaining read."
4,That's the good one,"This anti-glare radiation filter can make your eyes less strained, because it not only blocks up to 99% ELF/VLF E-Field radiation but alsoreduce the glare.With this filter, people can work longer than before and won't easy get eyestrain..."
2,Three Faults,"Three main faults of the book:1. The writing is so unclear that the reader has to read a passage several times to understand what the author is trying to say.2. This is strictly speaking not a biography on Emma Darwin, but an overview of the Darwins, Wedgwoods and Allens. Because the book is relatively thin, the details are superficial, lacking in depth.3. Bad structure. Many things are repeated and a more careful structuring would have made the book tighter."
5,I loved this book!,"This book was really great. I love Brandy and it told me a lot about her life and how hard she worked to be a singer. I liked how it covered so much about her early life and her family, too. It was very easy to follow and the pix are excellent. Definitely five stars!"
3,Forgot it's no longer compatible!,"Sure the hardware probably works, but I'll never know since I forgot my computer, and most modern computers now, no longer have parallel ports :( So before you make this purchase check your own machine or buy a Parallel-to-USB converter cable to go along with it. Though their performance is usually shaky, you might be better off trying to find someone who still runs a machine that has a parrallel port to hook this old device too."
4,A true Cher Fan,"Come on. 5 compilations in 5 years. With the same songs!! How about the ""Warner Years"" as 2 fers since Warners doesn't seem to think they will sell. Or the ""Boxed Set"". These record companies are wringing dollars out of Cher fans!! I am truly surprised that there is not at least one unreleased song on here to make all us Cher fans have to buy it!! I will get off my soap box now and patiently wait for the boxed set."
1,Another hits cd?,"Geesh the songs are all fives ok? But come on, how many greatest hits can one artist have anymore."
3,"Great Collection, But Not The Best","I am one of Cher's biggest fans and have almost every one of her collections, including the original vinyl recordings. I was disappointed in this compilation because it failed to include so many of her best works. Though this includes her geatest hits, it leaves out so many hidden gems. Every Cher collection I have besides the original recordings contains the same songs. It gets old after a while. I would love to see some of her original vinyl albums made into Compact Discs. Cher has obvious talent that puts other singers (who shall remain unnamed) to total shame. Her unique voice is mysterious and deep and allows you to melt into the music without cringing from the usual squeaky voices of other singers. I would indeed recommend this collection to people as their first Cher CD, but I would also tell them to purchase other compilations."
3,It deserves three stars for making it so adventurous,i enjoyed reading it it was a very good book.because they are very short books and i want to read the whole series.
5,Battery Charger,This product arrived on time and met my expectations. It works perfectly for the battery I needed it for.
4,Incredible changes in a few short years,"Nova's Car of the Future episode from 2008 really brings home how the automotive landscape has changed in a very short timeframe. At the end of 2011, while we're still in the early stages of a transition that was only beginning when Nova produced this, we've taken any number of steps they never anticipated. It's almost like one of those ""Life in 1980"" films from the 1962 World's Fair. Where's my nuclear countertop oven, anyway?"
1,Not about Absolute Zero,"I was very excited to see a documentary on ""Absolute Zero"" as it is not discussed much and I had a few basic questions that I am very curious about. 90% of the video was on the history of Tempature. The DVD did not cover half of what is already common knowledge on absolute Zero. If the title has read the ""The History to present day on Temerature"" it would have been interesting to those that were choosing that subjet. I was very disapointed."
2,"Bizarre, interesting B horror film","2 1/2 stars. Film starts as melodrama with a girl getting involved with a white slavery ring then veers into horror when her avenging brother has his brain transplanted into a gorilla who then goes after the villains. Wild stuff with an interesting cast: Paul Lukas, George Zucco, Joseph Calleia, Rod Cameron, et al."
1,Fun movie - bad DVD,"This is a fun Paramount horror film that has been on my ""I hope it comes out on DVD"" list for years. The movie is enjoyable, but don't expect it to be as good as a classic like DRACULA or FRANKENSTEIN. If you enjoy films like THE BRUTE MAN or CAPTIVE WILD WOMAN, you will enjoy THE MONSTER AND THE GIRL. So why only one star? The DVD has audio drop outs starting at 8 minutes into the film. Universal and Amazon are aware of the issue, but the problem has still not been fixed. It starts in the beginning courtroom scene where the prosecutor is saying the word ""fingerprints"" but you only get to hear ""finger..."" It continues from there with frequent audio dropouts. It is a problem wit the DVD because the old VHS tape does not have these flaws. If you must have the film on DVD, then buy it, but beware that the static dialogue is annoying!"
3,A Very Interesting Universal.,"I ordered the movie a couple weeks ago, and I am very happy with the condition of the product. I am a collecter of the Universal Studios monsters collection. I thought the movie itself was done fairly well. It was sort of a twist to the Monster set. nothing spectacular, but if you are a collecter of the set, it is a great thing to own.(...). Please let me know if this review was helpful."
1,Seiko watch defect after only 2 month in this site purchase,"It anormal that my new seiko watch stop run after only 2 months. It's a watch problem because the battery it's good, and i think and it's probably the raison for the 40% discount. I serelously desapoint."
2,Misleading,"Just wanted to point out that the Product Description above is not entirely correct- it states that disc 2 contains eight 'never before heard' tracks, but Menzel's dance-mix version of Defying Gravity has been out for over two years now, and Kerry Ellis's amazing arrangement is on her Wicked In Rock EP which was released over a year ago!"
5,Wicked: a Must-Have Addition for Any Musical Lover's Library,"Wicked is one of those musicals that will stand the test of time, never growing stale, never becoming dated. The lyrics are funny, poignant and thoughtful; often all three at once. The music is well written, lyrical and powerful without overshadowing the meaning of the words. The singing is excellent and the actors/actresses vocal nuances clearly portrays their character's emotional state. The sound quality is clear and immediate. In other words, this is probably as perfect a sound recording as you will ever find!"
2,Wicked Bad,"Some one should drop a house on the composer of these 'songs'.Still, I'm glad the soundtrack for this musical exists. It saves me the $80.00 or more I would have paid for tickets to see the show on stage!For that reason alone I give it two stars instead of one."
3,"The good, the bad and mediocre","The good is the performances by the leads.The bad is the lack of a synopsis so that the songs can be understood within the the libretto.The mediocre is the songs themselves. Schwartz has never been my favorite composer, but he has privided some excellent music, particularly for Children of Eden and Rags. Even Godspell and Pippin had their moments. Unhappily, those moments are very rare in Wicked."
2,Wicked - where are the songs?,"Is it me, or does anyone remember when Broadway musicals used to actually have songs in them? You know, the kind you walked out of the theater singing? After seeing the film version of Phantom of the Opera and seeing this show last night at the Pantages, I seriously wonder if any Broadway writers remember how to write a song. Where are the ""Maria""s? The ""When you're a jet""s? The ""Sound of Music""s? Nowadays they just crank out verbose, meandering showcase numbers for the leads to just belt away...and nothing more. I'd give my right nut for another Grease, another Tommy, another Rocky Horror Show, Hair, Camelot or man of La Mancha. I know people want to see a musical about the Wicked Witch of the West - I did - but let's call a spade a spade and admit these songs go nowhere (and trust me, I know of what I'm talking about, being a songwriter and musician for many years). Neat premise. No songs."
3,Truly Wicked,"I'm not a big fan of broadway shows and its not so much that I dislike musicals as much as I hate spending a ludicrous amount of money for a two hour show...But Idina Menzel was what made Wicked ""Wicked"".... Amazing scenery, staging and it was very clever but definitely to me, Idina was the show... I couldn't deal with Glinda's voice..too high pitched and annoying for me."
2,Wicked is a wicked example of how to destruy a good book,"it suks, ruins whole book, yes betsy from plilidelphia. if you base something on a book, you must be loyal to the book. it was totally weak. it sukd and so does any1 who thought it even compared 2 anything else on broadway.at least it had a decent plot. that was due 2 the book!!!!!!!"
4,Amazing...for some,"I love this show and cast recording...the talent is absolutely amazing, the songs are enjoyable, and the plot is good. However, if you don't really appreciate musicals, I doubt you're going to enjoy this. When showing this to friends who don't like Broadway, their reaction is, ""Well, the singing's good..."" But, of course, those who do enjoy Broadway musicals love it...I know I listen to it endlessly. There are a few boring numbers (as with most musicals), but the songs such as Defying Gravity, Popular, and For Good truly make up for it. Reccomended for those who appreciate musicals!"
5,Wicked is Amazing!,"By far the best broadway show I've seen in years, and the soundtrack goes along perectly with this. I haven't taken it out of my CD player in over a month. If you can't go see the show BUY THE CD! If you can see the show - go see it! And buy the CD! I predict this show will be winning some serious Tony Awards!"
3,Uneven score.,"With one incredible number followed by something not so wonderful followed by something incredible, the score is incredibly uneven. Scwartz's newest score screams out, ""A WORK IN PROGRESS"". The harmonies are nothing short of wonderful. ""No Good Deed"" is a masterpiece. However, some songs are amateur: ""Popular"", ""Wonderful"" as examples. Who knows? Maybe it's brough to life on stage. But for now, it's a frisbee, if you ask me."
4,Christmas Gift,The Wicked cd was given as a christmas gift to my sister in law that had seen the 2008 live show and really liked the music. She has said how much she loves the music and plays it in the car with her three year old so is also kid approved as well.
5,If I could give it a hundred stars I would!!!!,This is the absolute best musical out there! It is worth every penny! Kristen and Idina are wonderful!!!You will not be disappointed with this purchase. It is throughly enjoyable from start to finish. You will fall in love with Elphaba and Glinda!
3,Good but uneven,"I loved this musical, even though it deviated from the book, a dark political satire, into a happy piece of Broadway fluff. They may have messed with the story too much, but they messed with it well.The score is uneven. Some songs are just gorgeous, others seem a bit bland and poppy. I would even say that some songs really didn't need to be in there (""What Is This Feeling"" comes to mind). Both Chenoweth and Menzel give fantastic performances. I don't think Chenoweth really got enough of the music for herself though. Menzel is a talented singer, but she is obviously a pop singer, whose strongest talents are of the Broadway belter variety. Chenoweth has a well-trained, versatile voice that seems to adapt to an endless number of styles. Her chances to show this off were a bit limited though in this show. This CD is certainly worth the money for the great performances of ""Popular"", ""Defying Gravity"", and ""The Wizard and I""."
2,Disapointed,When I listened to this music I was disapointed. Many other have said that they think that this is great. Guess it's just not my cup of tea. H. Cooke.
5,Oh my.,"This show is simply stellar.Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth are absolutely fantastic as the two (very difficult) leading roles in this amazing show. Idina, as the fiery, emerald-skinned Elphaba, shines in her show-stopping numbers that stud this beautifully written show. Her big, brassy belt brings jaw-dropping life to brilliant songs like ""Defying Gravity"" and ""No Good Deed."" Chenoweth also is amazing, playing Glinda the Good with a quirky, Legally Blonde-esque air and a gorgeous operatic soprano voice that sears through the ensemble numbers like ""No One Mourns The Wicked"" and ""Thank Goodness."" She also makes quite a statement in a of her own, namely in the cutesy pop hit ""Popular"" and later with Idina in ""For Good.""Though some may claim that the music is a little awkward or stilts the story, this show is a captivating, character-driven masterpiece. The dramatic instrumental score, touching lyrics and (of course) amazing vocals is enough to make this a Broadway gem for years to come."
5,WOW!,"Purchased the CD prior to seeing this amazing show..the music had me singing all day and was the only CD in my car stereo for months. The show itself...wow! Makes you think of an alternative to the original movie The Wizard Of Oz...and everything fits....Gregory McGuire...what an imagination! Highly recommend the CD, the book and the Musical!"
5,Great Music,"We are going to see the stage play in September and I always like to know the music. This original cast album is marvelous, the voices superb and now I finally know the whys of those witches of Oz. The words supplied for the songs is extremely helpful. And now if know why the Wicked Witch of the West is GREEN!!"
5,Wickedly Great,This is the greatest CD. If you have seen the play you need to own this soundtrack. If you haven't seen the play buy it anyway and get out to see the play after listening to it.
5,Fantastic!,"Wicked is just amazing, and the numbers from the musical, well there's too much to say. Amazing."
4,Chills,"I have been a fan of Musicals since 2nd grade and have heard, and enjoyed singing along, with classics like Showboat, Oklahoma!, Les Miserables, Damn Yankees, etc. Rarely do I have the same reaction to contemporary musicals as to those classics.I first heard Defying Gravity through an online radio network and, though it was about 95 degrees in the room, I had chills from that song. Sure, the lyrics are semi-cheesy, but it's a combination of amazing, talented voices and decent written material. I don't know, really, what it is, but I like what I've heard and am buying a copy of the book & soundtrack.I haven't enjoyed new Broadway this much since Rent!"
5,"Magical, wonderful, and great to sing along with!","This was a spur of the moment purchase after I'd read the book Wicked by Gregory Maguire. I am a fan of Broadway in general, and have loved several cast recordings. I was a big fan of RENT and was more encouraged to buy this recording when I realized that Idina Menzel, who played Maureen in RENT, was playing Elphaba. I figured I'd give it a shot and see how I liked it.I cannot express how happy I am I did buy this! This is an absolutely WONDERFUL recording. It's easy enough to follow for people who haven't read the book, and it's a great accompanyment for those who have.There are lots of great songs on this album, but a few of my personal favs are What Is This Feeling?, Popular, and Defying Gravity. They are all great to sing along with as well!I highly recommend this recording to anyone who likes Broadway, likes the tales of Oz, likes Idina Menzel, or just likes to sing along with some fun songs."
4,Very nice!!,I'm taking my 13 yr old to see the show next month and wanted to get her the CD to listen to the music ahead of time! She loves it!! Can't wait for the show!
3,Wicked,"I don't know how I missed this when it was on Broadway. As a fan of Rent, I enjoyed Idina Menzel and was blown away when I saw her singing in a highlight from Wicked on a public television program. I enjoyed this original cast recording, and wish someone would make a movie so I could enjoy watching it again and again. It could be the new Wizard of OZ."
4,Most Delightful,I originaly got Wicked for my mother's birthday but after listening to it i had to have my own copy. everyone who has heard it in my car has purchased a copy. Wicked is one of the best musicals America has produced in a long time.
5,Great Soundtrack,This CD arrived in great shape as offered by the seller! The soundtrack is very entertaining!
4,wicked,"Just saw the play and really needed the music. Amazon delivery was prompt, cd quality excellent"
5,Wicked CD,My daughter received this as a gift for Christmas. Great music. She & I were able to see the musical at the Fabulous Fox Theatre in St. Louis. It was wonderful.
5,The Play Revisited,I went to see the play and wanted a reminder of it. The CD is a word for word rendition of the play and is awesome. I am so glad that I bought it. I have given it as a gift because the songs are so amazing that I wanted to share it with friends. I definitely recommend it!
4,Bought it,Not knowing anything about the story line. Waiting to see the musical. Good music and vocals.
2,"Ding Dong, This Witch Is D.O.A.","I've never read Gregory Maguire's cult novel this bombastic musical was based on, but if it's half as pretentious as Stephen Schwartz' unoriginal songs and its over-wrought score, then lucky me. After witnessing the elaborate, multi-million dollar train wreck on stage, I approached the soundtrack with trepidation but swore to realize that they are two separate entities. On CD, Chenowenth sings sweetly enough and her comic timing is precise, but the tone of her affect is parody - it's as if she is winking at us. Idina Menzel, so good in `Rent', here sings so over-the-top and so forcefully that any character nuance loses any iota of emotion and the big number `Defying Gravity' lies flat due to her dissipated power - the 'showstopper' that ends act 1 becomes it's anti-climax. My one sentence review of both the show and it's soundtrack: the cast of TVs `Fame' Meets Cirque De Soleil. My grade C+"
2,unPopular,"While the score has a few terrific numbers (Popular, Defying Gravity), this one is, at best, uneven. The opening number is awful. Others are laughable. I really enjoyed the book and was terribly disappointed seeing the show. I have enjoyed much of Stephen Schwartz's earlier work. I gave this cast recording repeated listens and never warmed to it. Despite all the praise, Wicked is just not up to par for me. Some of the lyrics are pedestrian. There is little character development or plot advancement through song. The Wizard's songs are awful. The show never decides what it wants to be about or whose story it should be. The leads are terrifically talented and deserve a better written show. IMHO, Avenue Q absolutely deserved the Tony over Wicked."
2,It made me laugh...a lot,"So after not being able to finish the book because it was so boring to me I listened to the music from this musical and read the whole synopsis. Actually it sounded like an interesting story and the music was at times stunning. However I would often find myself laughing at it for all it tried to be. It seemed almost like every song had to be a power ballad just to prove it was a good musical and ever song could be a hit. It didn't succeed. It just doesn't have the magic that some musicals have. ""For Good"" was the only song I thought was stunning and came close to those moments others musicals have that everything is just seems so unearthly and amazing. Other than that it is good, just not unbelievable like Sound of Music, Big River, The Phantom of the Opera, Lion King...it's just not in the ranks with those."
3,Bland,"This musical is very dull and if not for the star power of Idina Menzel, Kristin Chenoweth and Joel Grey it would completely be devoid of any sort of wit, musicality or hummable tunes. The above 3 by pure force of will try to make this show work and Joel Grey proves himself indispensable as he puts forth the shows weakest material with a grin and a forced sense of happiness. Truly a living legend, Joel Grey tries his best. Menzel and Chenoweth have the other 2 standout songs respectively, ""Defying Gravity"" and ""Popular"". THis is a musical that will not be remembered and everyone is the better for that."
2,Meh ... music doesn't carry on its own,"The music of Wicked was so so. It wasn't terrible - but most certainly wasn't worth all the praise it's been recieving. I got the CD because of all the fabulous reviews ... but I would be careful in buying over just that. I personally haven't seen the musical on Broadway. From photos I've seen (and the number performed at the ""Macy's Thanksgiving Parade""), it looks like a spectacular work of eye-candy and choreography ... however, the music on its own doesn't carry. There's an inconsitancy in the style of music, jumping from rock-musical (a style which I personally don't prefer, and dominates most of the album) and some typical Broadway. The text is poorly written as well. The only song that I felt was well done was ""Popular."" The music is unfortunately wasted on some very talented performers. It's probably one of those shows where you need the entire in-person Broadway experience. The CD on its own, though - don't bother."
5,Sondheim still has it,"He always could write a song... Pippin, Godspell.. and you will hear some good ones here!"
4,It grows on you,"I saw this show on broadway in nyc about a month ago, and I have to say, the first half hour or so is really slow. In fact, I almost walked out, but i'm glad that i diddnt because it gets really good once the background story in the beginning finishes. I loved the book, and the concept is great, so I was a little disappointed that the musical wasnt a little more sophisticated. It seemed to me like it wouldnt have taken that much more of an effort to make some of the lyrics a bit more, well, relevant. A couple of the songs (particularly the chorus) is a little cheesy, but after listening to the cd a few times, the soundtrack grows on you, and it will make you want to see the show again. Overall it is a cool show, in fact, probably the best of the new broadway musicals."
4,....,"true, the book is much deeper (and in my opinion, better) than the play. the play is simply entertaining sentimental fluff. however the songs are still amazing to listen to over and over again (and isn't that what broadway is REALLY all about? entertainment?)Chenoweth's voice is so pure and constant, and Menzel has a powerful set of pipes. the songs are all ""cute"" and fun to sing along to. wicked is one of those plays that you either hate or love after the first time you see it. most people i know love it. i am one of those people..."
5,Turly Amazing Musical,"This is a truly amazing musical. The sets, the acting, the humor and the dramatic touches all lend to an excellent story that transports you back into the Land of Oz, but told from a different perspective. The Cast Recording album, like most Broadway recordings, captures the main songs and pieces that advance the story. While not a substitute for the real thing, this album evokes memories from the show and also entertains those who haven't yet seen the production.Truly a first rate album and production! I see Tonys written all over this one."
5,A different view of Oz,"I'm going to find the novel and read it again. I found the music lively and engrossing. I hope this tours sometime in the future, I can't afford New York."
4,Wicked CD,"The music is great and came from a great show. Purchase transaction was, simple, efficient and delivered promptly."
4,Fantastic!,"I saw a little bit about the Broadway show on a TV show, and I thought 'I have to get that CD'. A week or two or I saw an ammatuer performance of it put on by 15 girls, and was very impressed by the music. I got the CD about two months and loved it.There are about twelve great songs on it (some of my favourites being 'What is this Feeling?', 'Defying Gravity', 'Dancing though Life', 'For Good' and 'No-one Mourns the Wicked) but there are quite a few (in my opinion) duds. There are a lots of songs that sound very similar, and a few of the songs are less than a minute. I would have prefered to have less songs on the CD, and less rubbish.As the singers, Idina Menzel, or course, is fantastic, but Kristin Chenoweth's voice is slightly annoying and whiny sounding sometimes.Apart from some of the negative things I've said, I've really enjoyed this CD and would recomend it to anyone."
5,Buy This CD,"I bought this CD because I am a supporter of the amazing voices of both our beautiful Australian singer,Delta Goodrem and the equally amazing Leann Rimes and to hear their duet ""For Good""...but i have fallen in love with the entire soundtrack.Do yourself a favour and buy it"
3,It was okay..,"It is good quality at times, but at other's it has poor quality. There are also times where you don't see the stage( I'm guessing since you aren't allowed to tape the musical)."
3,an overrated musical,"While Stephen Schwartz is unquestionably a Broadway veteran, Wicked is not his strongest score. The talent on the recording is exceptional, but there are few songs that actually stir the blood, and some of the rhymes are almost painful they are so forced. However the Act 1 finale called Defying Gravity is almost worth the price of the CD in itself.Idina Menzel, Kristen Chenoweth, Joel Grey, and Norbert Leo Butz all display ample talent, which undoubtedly made this show the smash hit it became. But this is why she won a Tony award and the score did not."
4,Wickedly Wonderful!,"Like many others, I've seen the musical on Broadway. But, unlike many, I actually preferred it with the cast performing now, NOT the original cast, the one that's singing on the soundtrack. Especially Shoshona Bean's Elphaba.Nonetheless, I would have liked to hear just the singing without the spoken words of the play. It gets in the way of the songs. Favorites are the whimsical ""Popular"" and ""What is this Feeling"" and the very moving ""Defining Gravity"". There is so much emotion in that song and I find myself thinking ""Yay Elphaba! You go girl!"""
5,Absolutely Amazing,"When I ran into this CD I was in Borders picking up another CD and I thought I'd listen to this one since it was on display. My jaw dropped and I bought it immediately. The music is modern and poppy but fully orchestrated and broadway! I was infatuated with this when I first bought it. I know almost all the lyrics to every song. I bought and devoured the book (which is even BETTER than the musical), I went to NY and saw it on broadway (and it is as visually amazing as it is Book and Music wise.) Basicly Wicked took over my life for a couple of months. I think young and old will like this alike. It is one of the greatest 21st century musicals hands down. I would suggest this to EVERYONE. Favorite Song: ""No Good Deed Goes Unpunished"""
4,Totally amazing!,"I first heard of Wicked when I was in ""The Wizard of Oz"" at my school, and our director told us the basic plot line at one rehearsal. When I came home, I happened to see my sister's Wicked soundtrack lying around and decided to listen to a few songs my director had mentioned. Well, they were awesome, and I borrowed the soundtrack for a few days to learn all the songs. I printed out the lyrics from a website, and now I just go around singing them all day long! I'm going to NY this summer and I really hope to see Wicked, because I know it would be totally amazing to see these songs that I already think are awesome performed on Broadway!"
5,Can there be 10 stars?,"This is the best new musical staged since Ragtime. The performances are stellar, the orchestrations move the story beautifully! Highly recommended! Buy the CD and see the musical when you can!"
4,Wicked - Brilliant Musical with some shining songs,"The story behind this musical has to be the most wonderful thing I have ever heard, it is complicated and touches things on so many levels. It is great for children who enjoy the Wizard of Oz and even better for adults who can ponder the questions that this musical stirs up. There are a few songs in this musical that are just stunning, like Defying Gravity, I'm Not That Girl, No Good Deed, but then there are some that seem unnecessary and seem like just frilling, Popular, Sentimental man. However, the frills aren't many and Defying Gravity is one of the most empowering songs I have ever heard. No Good Deed is also incredibly heartbreaking and leaves you with just such sympathy towards Elphaba. This soundtrack is worth it, the few bad songs dont get in the way, thats why we have the skip button!"
1,Wicked,"Sorry, didn't like it at all. I'm a big musical fan, but this didn't do it for me all.PS. Since writing this review, I saw a production in Melbourne, Australia, and I have to say I've changed my mind. Seeing it all together, is a completely different kettle of fish to just listening to the score. Excellent stuff."
1,Worst musical of all time? Probably.,"Banal, mainstream fluff for the crowd that enjoys musical adaptations of Legally Blond and Disney movies. A great concept completely ruined by music composed for the lowest common denominator. Simply singing your dialogue does not make it a ""song"" -- and such lame, corny dialogue at that. Utterly agonizing to sit through. Somehow, it managed to knock Phantom off the top of my worst musicals list. If there were a Musicals for Dummies book, this would be the first chapter. Parents do themselves and their children an utter injustice by seeing this; what a way to warp one's conception of what musical theatre can and should be."
5,Wicked Broadway Album,"Fantastic! I know every song by heart. The songs are strong enough to stand on their own even if you are not familiar with the story. Both Menzel and Chenewith have perfect voices to sing the power balads. My favorite song is ""For Good""."
4,Great musical - liked the voices from Chicago performance better,"This is a great musical. If have the chance to see it, go. The Broadway sound track is very good but we saw a great performance in Chicago and what we remember are those voices so it doesn't seem as good because of that."
5,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i am abosolutely in love with this cd. i bring in in my walkman everywhere, and im almost ALWAYS listening to it. i went to see the show and loved it even more! a must have, especially for broadway lovers!"
4,Menzel and Chenoweth,"A friend commented to me that while the women in this musical shine, ""the men suck"". I wouldn't be quite that harsh, but the reason to get this disc is to hear Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth. They both sound absolutely fantastic, and the orchestrations are lush. At times funny, at times heartbreaking, this is the must have cd from Broadway this season. Some of the lyrics are a little pedestrian, but the ladies overcome that easily. And this musical is not nearly as dark as the book. This is definately the best musical to come along since Thoroughly Modern Millie."
5,Three Words: OH MY GOD!!,"You need this CD! Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth are phenomenal as Elphaba (The Wicked Witch of the West) and Glinda respectivley. The song ""Defying Gravity"" is worth the price of the CD alone. This is the best show on Broadway and if you ever get the chance to go see it DO IT! If Idina Menzel doesn't win the Tony I'm going to cry!"
3,"Pleasant, different, and BIG!!","Not up to the book, but tries valiantly to capture the realtionship between the 2 witches ( pre Dorothy). Works 80% of the time, a little less music and a little more character and plot development would have helped. Still, some fine tunes, dazzling effects and powerhouse performances by Idina Menzel and Kristen Chenowith. While I didn't leave the theater feeling elated, I wasn't disappointed either. Not a great musical, but pleasant!"
3,Great Show,"Though the musical can not even begin to have the sophistication of the SUPERB book by Gregory McGuire, it is great fun. Though the original cast is good, the current broadway cast (Shoshana Bean as Elphaba, Megan Hilty as Glinda, Ben Vereen as The Wizard...) is a cast I wish I could have a recording of. Shoshana Bean blows Idina Menzel out of the water...her voice is more stable in all registers and her acting is far superior. I'm okay with spending $15 on the CD with Idina but I'd never have paid $200 for a ticket for her...Shoshana I plan to see at least 2 more times in NYC."
5,The Most Amazing CD I Have Ever Heard,"I first heard ""Popular"" while listening to the radio and immediately decided that ""Wicked"" was a CD I must own. This is an incredible CD with amazing vocals, great lyrics, and despite popular belief, perfect orchestrations. ""Wicked"" truly encourages the idea of two sides to every story. I don't think Broadway can get any better than this CD! Trust me, hte first time you pop this CD into your player, you won't be able to take it out!"
5,Wicked is FABULOUS!,"What an amazing score! If you saw the play - even if it wasn't this ""original"" cast, you'll want this CD b/c it is wonderful!! I've been singing ""Defying Gravity"" in my head all day - a must-have!!:)"
5,What Is This Feeling?,"Well, it's certainly not loathing over this cast recording! I absolutely love this album! Stephen Schwartz's music is beautiful and uplifting, the performances are outstanding and the spirit of the show is definitely conveyed through this cast recording. All the songs are catchy enough to get stuck in your head, but my personal favorites are ""What Is This Feeling"", ""For Good"", ""Dancing Through Life"", ""One Short Day"" and of course ""Popular"". I may not know a whole lot about overly sensitive and pedestrian lyrics or synthetic sounding music, but I know what I like and I think that ""Wicked"" is a great recording for the whole family to enjoy.~~~Amy~~~"
5,Absolutely BreathTaking,"i first heard of this musical when i was watching the thanksgiving day parade and i fell in love with it. I searched around the web for info on the play and preordered the cd...it was worth the wait.....the cd is breathtaking...Idina Menzel ( the wicked witch of the west) will send chills down your spine with my favorite songs ""the wizard and I"" and ""Defying Gravity"" Kristin Chenoweth (Glinda) brings a pop sound to the play and is always fun to listen to in ""popular""I recommend this play to everyone who loves great singingBUY THE CD!!!"
2,My favorite part GONE!!!,"I love the play!! but one of my favorite parts was completely gone!! the part where they are dancing when Galinda gives Elfaba the witch hat as a joke and she ends up dancing with Elfaba and then they all start to dance with them, the start of it is shown the the camera goes down and the the rest of the scene is omited!!!!! I was VERY dissapointed!! and most of the time all you see is where the face of each actor is a big shining light so you can't see their faces. it was ok BUT NOT WORTH THE PRICE!!!!!!!!"
2,What a Shame!,"Big fans of Gregory Maguire's book, we were thrilled to score tickets to see Wicked on Broadway during a short visit to NYC. What a waste of a good evening!A dark and thought-provoking novel about the cost of being different has been turned into an upbeat, feel-good piece of cotton candy. Despite terrific efforts by the cast (which you hear on the album), as well as the lighting, set and costume designers, the poor writing shows through.The score is at best pedestrian -- and the lyrics are banal. But really, all was lost once the creative team decided to change such minor plot points as having the Wicked Witch die (instead, she runs off into the sunset with the Scarecrow) . . . .We found the entire experience painful in the extreme."
2,Defying Sanity,"To be entirely honest, I listened to this CD with quite high expectations, having heard so many rave reviews about it from all my friends. And admittedly, the vocals are fantastic and the plot is somewhat more original than the usual Broadway fluff. But other than a few standout songs (three or four at the most), I found this pretty standard, run-of-the-mill stuff. The music is far too poppy and synthesizer-driven (it reminds me of the eighties), the lyrics are often awkwardly phrased (verdigris?), and most of the characters I found so fascinating in the book (Fiyero and Elphaba, namely) were completely stripped of any and all color in the musical. There's no new ground covered here, no fresh ideas or characters; just a few good singers, some mediocre songs, and a watered-down plot. Major disappointment. I suggest Avenue Q for some real entertainment."
4,Reliving the Experience,"I love this CD. I play it in the car so I can sing along and relive the experience of seeing Wicked here in Indianapolis. I especially like to play my favorite songs such as Popular, What is the Feeling, Dancing Through Life and For Good.Buy it and Enjoy!"
4,need to record with new cast,I was privileged to be able to see Wicked in London with Kerry Ellis as the Elphaba. Her voice blows away anyone else's especially in Flying High. I hope that a new CD is made with her.
1,Eh. Not for everyone.,"For pages and pages back, this show has got 5 stars... oh, well. This show seems to appeal to many, but after sampling it myself, decided that it was not for me. The characterisations are dull, the songs are boring after the first playing, the orchestrations pathetic to say the least. The whole show just smacks of ""appealing to the general mob"" syndrome which is starting to take over this amazing genre.The lyrics are tacky and the music predictable. The essance of musical theatre is simply that that is implied by the name - drama for music. There is none of that in this musical. Certainly there's minimal acting in tracks such as ""Defying Gravity"" and ""Popular"" - it's not done very well, for starters, and the rest of the tracks feel like disjointed 3-minuters on a pop album.Save your money for real musical theatre."
1,O-ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,The 1 star is for the set designer. The show itself was awful. Slow and boring. The (way too many) songs are easily forgetable. Even with the visuals I found myself nodding out during the first act. I'm amazed at all the 5 star reviews for this CD. There must be some hidden subliminal messages in the tracks or something. This has to be the worst broadway score I have ever heard.
5,WICKED'S DA- BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!,"wicked rules Idina Menzel soooooooo deserved that tony award.this play is so original and deserves to be cherished forever x the little sideways eight symbol I especially liked the songs Defyning Gravity , Popular, As long as your mine , What is this feeling ? , and For good. How could anyone live without the soul touching lyrics of Wicked!!"
5,"Great, but still a musical soundtrack","This is an excellent recording of the musical. There is also a very minimum of dialogue included, what you have here is pretty much just the songs, which I took as a positive. Some of them, however, are really short sleepers that you pay little attention to in the play.The great ones, however, are magnificently performed and sound wonderful.All in all, a good purchase.Side note, album art is beautiful, liner notes non-existent."
5,It's like watching it again in my head!,Awesome album. Every time I listen to it it's like I'm watching the musical again. The music does a great job of painting a visual of what's happening on stage. This is one of the few albums I can listen to in its entirety over and over again. And it still gets me emotional!
5,Something For Everyone,"The thing I really like about this CD is that there is a sound for almost everyone who likes stage music. It has the perky, upbeat, fun music in a song like ""Popular"" or ""What Is This Feeling?"". It has serious songs, displaying more finished musical telnt in a song like ""Defying Gravity"", and then you hear songs that are soulful like ""For Good"" or ""The Gilr Inside"". I had a lot of trouble deciding between four or five stars for the rating, but the musical talents of Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth put it over the top toward the five rating. I would really recommend this soundtrack..."
5,Great Music!!!,There is not one song on this album that you and your whole family will not enjoy. I highly recomend this album. You should also see the show!!!
5,Are you a BW fan! a must own than!,THis is a one Album that is a must have if you are a Broadway fanatic!Love the show. Saw it twicw. Once on tour and once in NYC!My two fav. songs are popular!! (Love the duo) and For good!Also who can forget the altimate theme song for the play (defying gravity!!)
4,Wickedly entertaining:Perfection? No.,"This cd is one of my favs. Mainly because the score is wonderful. Actually no. It is not wonderful. It is more of a mediocre score that becomes a let down every now and again. But when it has its moments, it has its moments. There are songs that stay in your head forever (and no that is not a bad thing in this case). The performers are incredible and the orchestrations are to die for. Stephen Schwartz has a way with words in his ballads. So many potential songs could be sung in the pop world (As long as your mine, For Good, I'm not that Girl) The show is brilliant and you really must see it in order to understand.The lack of a synopsis in the booklet is mainly because there are so many plot twists and surprises that it would ruin the show for you. The lack of pictures doesn't really give you a feel of what kind of feel the show is trying to have. But it is definatley worth your money. ONe of the best bargains of the year."
4,A must for Broadway Buffs,"I haven't yet actually gone to a performance of WICKED, but I know that I'll love this CD even more after I do. Lyrics have Cole Porter-esque literacy and cleverness (""you'll join the right cohorts, you'll be good at sports"".) The musical themes are a tad repetitious but a few (""Popular"" and ""Defying Gravity"") have classic show-tune infectiousness that will leaving you humming."
5,Memorable! Breathtaking! Inspiring!,"This is the kind of entertainment Broadway musicals have been missing for years! This is truly the best cd I have ever heard in my life. It has MEMORABLE tunes, BREATHTAKING notes, and is INSPIRING to one when listening to it. Especially in Defying Gravity. The soaring melodies make you feel limitless as Idina Menzel takes you with her in her roof-rasing voice. In Popular, Kristin Chenoweth's lovely soprano voice bounces off the notes and is entirely a Get-Happy song.Each of the songs posess the most beautiful tunes I have ever heard. Kristin Chenoweth, Idina Menzel make this the BEST CD I HAVE EVER BOUGHT! WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THE SHOW! GO BUY THE CD!"
5,I heard the Soundtrack before I saw the Musical......,"and I had the chills from some of the songs. I had bought the CD knowing I was going to see the musical in the next couple of months. The music is catchy, strong, fun, and ""wonderful"". It gave me a pretty good idea of what was going on before I saw the musical, and when I saw the show this weekend, it was even better than the CD. I also cannot wait to see this musical again, and I'll probably play the soundtrack a hundred times more before then."
4,Now I have to see the play...,I originally bought the CD because of the soundtrack (tease) for an advertisement on the radio. The song was so upbeat and fun I couldn't resist. After receiving and listening to the CD I can't wait to see the play/musical.
5,Wicked,"now as i am listening to the Wizard and I, it is only obvious that so much talenet and work went into this amazing music and show. I've been entranced by this wonderful musical for a year about, when one of my friends showed it to me. I saw it in April, have tickets for December and plan to see it again. I can't get enough of it. I truly rate this 10 stars but this site doesn't allow it. This is by far the best music i've ever heard. I listen too it evry day, play it on the piano, trumpet, sing it evry second of my life, my life revovles around this show. Idina Menzel (elphaba)and Kristen Chenoweth (G(a)linda)are truly remarakable in evry way. I love this more than any thing... i think i wouldn not be able to live with out it."
5,Loved Wicked,"I loved this musical and the soundtrack, I'd go see it again in a heartbeat, and I don't know how I ever lived without this soundtrack."
2,Not worth the extra $5,"I love the musical 'Wicked', however this second disc is horrid. I really didn't need to buy the disco version of Defying Gravity. I wish I had previewed the second disc before I purchased it. The tracks done in the foreign languages were interesting, too bad there weren't more of them."
4,Almost perfect,"This item would have been almost perfect if it had not been for the food (?) stuck to the back of the case it came in. I had this sent to my granddaughter as a gift, and the condition of the case was, to say the least, a surprise - not good. The CD itself was great, and the contact between the Seller and myself was fine. In the future, he should double-check the item inside and OUT."
3,A dry hole musically,"I recently saw this show in Los Angeles. By that time Wicked had been playing for some time and, if I am not mistaken, had already toured through town once before. So I went with some pretty high expectations. Given my anticipation and the possibility of a let down, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The book and staging were extremly clever and the performances, especially by the two leads, were genuinely exciting. Unfortunately, I cannot say much for the music. It was servicable and got the plot from point A to point B. There wasn't one moment, however, that genuinely moved me. Each song moved along in an inoffensive way, neither contributing nor seriously damaging the proceedings. Given the talent of the singers this is a genuine shame. They worked hard but had nothing really solid to fall back on. The show can be recommended but I can't say much for the CD."
5,Wonderful show!!,This is an excellent CD and would be great for the family. Chosen music gives clear picture of the show.
5,Amazing,Best musical i have seen in years. Hope they come out with a movie one day based on this story.
4,Fantastic,"I was able to view Wicked in Chicago, and was completely blown away. Never have I seen a play as great as that I thought. I bought the soundtrack, and was astounded. I then however, viewed the Wicked performance in London, and was awestruck. The voice of Kerry Ellis easily toppled other performers. Without a doubt, this soundtrack is amazing, but for the real treat, go to a London performance, and be wowed senseless."
5,GREAT CD,Shipping was fast and this CD is GREAT!!! I love it soooooo much. You have to go see the show first though.
4,"A bit of a ""Hitch"" in the 39 Steps","The obvious things are that this is a very old movie, and one made by Hitchcock. Being very old, it has little in common with Hitch's later, more famous films. It is black & white and rather fuzzy, as you'd expect. The audio is very tinny, with almost no bass, and this will be a ""Hitch"" for you if you can't adjust your equipment for it. It still won't sound good, but tolerable.I watched it again recently, because I had just seen a play based on it, which transformed it into a comedy. It was interesting to note the many points of contact. If you are into Hitchcock, you will probably want to see it, too."
1,"Bland, boring and lifeless.","My fifth grader had to read this book, as did the whole school as part of a project to encourage family reading. What a boring book. An awfully thin gruel of multiculti anecdotes about an immigrant family from India. Why not choose real literature instead of this pabulum? The real laugher-- the boy's father comes to this country to get a job with a computer company."
1,Disappointing,This is another example of an author lending his name to a book that was entirely written by a third-tier writer. The plot was more boring than the dialogue. Don't waste your time with this one.
4,A book you will WANT to read,"I picked this book up at my school library, hoping that i'd like it. Better than that, I loved it! Filled with action, and suspense, Traitor by Andy McNab and Robert Rigby was by far one of my favorite books of the year!"
3,O.K.,This book was alright i didnt like how it uses so many military terms. The other reasont it only got a 3 out of 5 is because the only real suspenseful action part of the book is the last ten pages. I would not wait in line too long for this book.
4,Good for the young single traveler,Lots of good info especially if you are in the 20-40 range and single. A fine choice for a pocket size phrase finder.
3,Second CD a solid effort,"A solid Celtic CD with the songs well done. Of the tunes, I especially liked their rendition of Jigjazz by Brendan Power and The Return to Chernobyl (the first reel of four in The Twin Katies)."
5,Awesome Show!,"This is, by far, the best show ever created for TV! I only hope they make more episodes. It's not just about football. In fact, the sport is just a small portion of the show. The rest is a great drama about a coach, his family, his team and his fans. It's a must-see!!!"
3,too slow to watch.,"I've watched only the first chapter, but it was way too slow.I started watching it because of the actress - she acts on another show I like-"
5,best show ever. period.,You must check out this show!This is the extreme opposite of all the bad tv shows out there right now.You feel like part of the show and as if these are your friends and family and then when the issues are raised during each show you really feel them.If you want a truly unique and incredible tv experience watch friday night lights - i guarantee you will love it.You don't need to like football to love this show...
5,Great show!,Love this show! It is so addictive! The seller was good I recieved the DVD set just as described and in a timely manner.
4,What a great series!,"Wow ... the TV series is better than the movie. How many times can a person truthfully say that? I enjoyed the movie, and I've just about watched the complete first season. A great storyline and the people seem like people who might live next door to you.Personally, I don't care for the extreme close-ups, because sometimes they don't include the person's eyes. But I suppose the camera work is one of the things that differentiate this series from the competition.Texas high school football is the underlying thread that ties all the episodes together, but I wouldn't call this a program about football. It's really about relationships."
5,A Taste of Texas,"I loved this largely overlooked TV drama.There are so many aspects to the show which really remind me of Texas life.Good value for money and excellent light entertainment.If you missed it on TV, buy the DVD now!"
2,Too bad it isn't as good as the movie,I admit that I didn't watch much of this show. But what I saw was predictable with a mediocre cast. I had no interest in staying with it.
4,Guilty pleasure,"I'm not a huge football fan and I don't really like cheesy soap opera-esque shows but somehow I got hooked! I just really like all of the characters and the football part of it is not the majority of what the show focuses on and even less so in season 2. Most of the acting is also good with the exception of 1, maybe 2 people."
5,Friday Night Lights Season 1,Excellent show! Streaming service worked very well. Once or twice throughout the entire first season Amazon's service froze up or got patchy but otherwise enjoyable.
5,So good money back guaranteed,"Simply put the best drama series in television; any television not just network television. It is so good that it got renewed by NBC for a second season even though only couple of millions devoted fans watched. It got renewed because the network believed it have the potential to attract more viewers and the network have so much faith that the DVD is only $19.99 for a 5-disc set and it comes with a money back guarantee (the first I ever heard on a DVD). So if you are one of those people who is curious about the hype from critics and fans then go check couple of episodes online at www.nbc.com and then go buy the set and if you are not into it just get your money back, you got nothing to lose but to experience the best show on TV right now."
5,Best First Season,"This is by far the best opening season to any television that I have ever seen and believe me when I say that I am a massive television buff. Not to sound like a complete loser but I currently watch over 35 series on television and in my lifetime has gone through every episode of about 22 finished series. Friday Night Lights as a series has flaws but it is still great. The first season of the show was as perfect an initial season can be. While the show does fall off during the second season, the third season was based on redemption, and the fourth and fifth had a cast overhaul, this first season will help you develop surprisingly emotional connections with all the characters. You will grow to see the complications within the character of Smash or Riggins or Matt Saracen or Julie Taylor. You will grow to love the Taylors. This first season will be the best first season you will ever watch of any television show."
5,Football and High School - A Great Combination!,"This is a great series from TV that although critically acclaimed, never got the mass public viewers that it deserves. If you are a high school football fan or just want to see a good series about high school life, this is a great series that I would highly recommend. This series should still be on prime time TV!"
4,"Excellent Acting, Writing Loses Steam","First several episodes of this first season were riveting, moving, and first-rate. The lives of these individuals are treated with great care and respect, and the actors are almost uniformly perfect. You come to understand and care for them as you would your own friends. Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton are particularly noteworthy in the leads. Unfortunately by the end of season one, the sloppiness of some of the writing starts to show. I intend to watch the entire 5 seasons, but I'm hoping that the writing improves or I might not make it through."
5,Best Show Ever,"Such a shame it never got the support it deserved! Warning to parents: especially in the first season, there are some pretty uncomfortable sex scenes. That actually got better in subsequent seasons."
5,This Show Even Hooked My Wife!,"I could write pages and pages about this show, but it is the BEST show I've ever watched on TV! My wife NEVER watches TV and it is even hard to get her to go to a movie, but this series (introduced to us over Christmas by our son via streaming) hooked even her! I used to live in Austin, TX and even recognized a couple of places. I can tell you that Berg was able to capture the 'feel' of living in Texas and now I want to go back! We watched all 5 seasons since the week before Christmas 2012 and finished them on Jan 19, 2013. We are both very depressed and grieving over the loss we felt coming to the end. We feel like we have lost some family and we are still very melancholy and are now planning a trip together back to Austin (my wife is from Ukraine and has never been to Austin) soon just to visit and get some brisket BBQ! Watch this series and prepare to get hooked! There will never be another one like it - I'm serious!! there needs to be 6 starts!"
4,Great TV watching!,The product arrived in a timely fashion and was greatly appreciated by all who watched the DVDs!
4,friday Night Lights the first season,"Arrived very quickly, and in perfect condition. I was very satisfied with my purchase. I would certainly buy from Amazon again."
2,DVD does not use originally aired music,"I was really disappointed to find out that the DVD set uses a different soundtrack than the originally aired episodes. So beware, I think it is a big detriment."
5,BEST SHOW ON TV!!,This show is by far the best show on TV right now. I had never watched until I bought the DVD. It was so good that I watched Season 1 in about a week. I have since watched Season 2 and this show is now the highlight of my TV viewing. Can't wait for Friday Night!
4,This version of Kilkelly is more beautiful....,"There is a gorgeous, haunting song on this album-- Kilkelly--about an old man whose children leave Ireland during a potato famine for a better life. Those of you of irish descent--or with an irish heart--get out your handkerchiefs. Particularly if you've been drinking whiskey or beer. Mick sings like an angel, and this is a better version than the one on his cd entitled Kilkelly."
4,Good for when you don't have many options,"As with most no-rinse shampoos, this tends to leave a bit of a residue. It is wonderful for those people who are completely bedfast. Bought it for my mom who was unable to get up and was able to at least keep her hair fairly. Can be warmed slightly in a microwave, which is good for those who are fragile."
4,didn't notice there was only 1 in package.,wish the price would of been better. It is A bit high for one shampoo cap. Was easy to use and worked great love it.!
4,No Rinse Hair Shampoo Cap,Product was reasonable priced. Arrived when expected. Ordered it to help with post surgical recovery. It allows you to wash your hair and feel better after surgery without leaving the hospital bed.
2,used post back surgery,"I purchased this item because I was having a back surgery that would make me unable to take a shower for two weeks. While the product is very convenient and does get your hair wet, I do not think that it worked very well for my type of hair (thick hair, past the shoulder). It left residue in my hair and I never felt that my hair was very clean. I struggled with getting all parts of my hair wet, due to needing to ""fold"" my hair to fit it all in the cap. However, I do think this product would work well for shorter hair, and the ability to warm it up is very nice."
3,Love this wild and crazy guy,Steve Martin is a comic genius! This SNL DVD compiled his monologues and sketches from his numerous host appearances. The DVD alone is worth it for the King Tut song. It is hilarious!!!I only wish they included more sketches because I'm sure there are some very funny ones that stayed on the cutting room floor.
4,Theodoric of York,Classic skits from SNL's glory days. Very enjoyable.I plan to use the 'Theodoric of York' skit when I teach medical students about Evidence Based Medicine and the need for good randomized controlled trials to inform physicians about treatment options. I am curious to see how this works given that many of the students were not born when the episode aired (1978)...
1,WARNING...!,"This DVD states it contains skits including Mr.Bill, Father Guido Sarducci, and The Blues Brothers. These are not on this DVD....false advertising at it's worst!...I returned it."
2,Saturday Night Live - The Best of Steve Martin,I could have sworn I once thought Steve Martin was funny. Either I was stoned when I thought he was funny or they left the funny stuff off this DVD.
3,Mostly for fans,"Not being American, I have never watched the show. So I was basing my expectations on films in which I have seen these comedians.It should be said perhaps that I am not a huge fan of stand-up comedy, I find it usually strained. But anyway, I am vaguely disappointed. I bought The Best Of Steve Martin and of Mike Meyers, and... well, while they are clearly both amongst our most talented comedians, I feel that the material on these DVDs is really not that damn good. I mean the writing, the sketches. Particularly considering that these are *best of* collections.I dunno... I guess you had to be there."
3,A Bit of a Misfire,"While Steve Martin is certainly one of the best hosts of the ""classic"" years of SNL, the decision to not include the ""Dancing in the Dark"" sketch with Gilda Radner is an unforgiveable oversight. They could have easily dropped one of the newer, less funny bits (although they're not as bad as I'd feared) in favor of this gem. And why is it that of all the Festrunk Brothers sketches, the same one appears on every anthology I've seen? Still, lots of laughs here, but the DVD notes that there are ""special appearances by Father Guido Sarducci, Mr. Bill and the Blues Brothers"" which in fact are not on the DVD. At least the two bonus sketches are from the ""classic"" period (1975-1979). One disturbing aspect about the DVD continues to bug me--the lack of cast and writer credits, a real insult to the talents who created these (mostly) funny television moments. Trimark/SNL Studios: Release the 1975 episode hosted by Richard Pryor and all will be forgiven."
3,"Not the best chosen skits, but still funny","Steve Martin is a comedian with great range. He can be goofy and do incredible slapstick, working with his whole body. He can also be incredibly dry and witty, saying the funniest lines without batting a lash. I don't think that this collection showcases his best work, but you still get a very good sample from this marvelous comedian. The King Tut routine is a classic; also funny is the tight-fisted James Bond."
1,Not Closed-Captioned,"This DVD is advertised as close-captioned, but it is not. I purchased it for a friend who is deaf and I am disappointed that she cannot enjoy it."
4,The Best of Steve Martin,"I'm a Steve Martin fan. I enjoyed this DVD very much. There were a few pieces that didn't center around Steve Martin that sort of left me guessing, but in general the parts of Steve Martin on SNL that I remember were as good as ever seeing them again after a long period of time. Steve's KING TUT is toward the end and is my all time favorite. It's a good buy for the money if you remember the earlier Saturday Night Live days."
1,Newer Issue is a better deal than this,"If you're interseted in this, then get the 2007 release which has 95% of this material plus additonal stuff, and shows much higher quality post-production."
3,At least we got King Tut (buried with a donkey),"Most of the choices were a little disappointing, but King Tut in its full glory, the Coneheads and the Tax man, and Yoric, Barber of Old are classics."
2,Not worth it!,"I was pleasantly surprised to receive this DVD as a christmas present, but upon watching it I had to change my mind. Who makes these ""best of DVDs?"" This is the second one I've gotten that has been completely off. It's like someone just compiled a bunch of random sketches that had Steve Martin in it and threw them together in this DVD. They definitely weren't the best of. Not only that, many of them were from the same 2007 (? I'm guessing here) performance he did when he was promoting ""Pink Panther"". For someone who has hosted SNL over 14 times, there should be a lot more footage to throw in other than stuff from that one performance.Save your money and wait till something better comes out."
4,Hit and Miss...,"I've purchased several of these ""Best of <whoever>"" SNL videos, and so far it's been hit and miss as far as the choices they make for which skits to include on the DVD. The ""Best of Tom Hanks"" has so far been the most disappointing, and the ""Best of Alec Baldwin"" has been so far the most pleasing, and this ""Best of Steve Martin"" falls somewhere inbetween.Still, if you are a Steve Martin fan, this is certainly worth purchasing, especially for the ""King Tut"" classic, and for the banjo monologue and for the hilarious competition between Steve and Alec for the record of most times as a host of SNL. I'd probably give this one 3 1/2 stars if that was an option."
2,Not Ready for DVD,"A poorly assembled ""Saturday Night Live"" compilation that hardly does justice to veteran host Steve Martin's comedic brilliance. Classic routines from the late 1970s (""Two Wild and Crazy Guys,"" ""King Tut"" and ""Theodoric of York, Medieval Barber"") are interspersed with mediocre skits from the 1980s and '90s. Revisit the original broadcasts from SNL's golden era and avoid this disappointing DVD release."
2,Not worth watching more than once...,"This DVD didn't make me laugh even once. None of the sketches on this DVD seemed like they could be Steve Martin's best. It is also short, and the quality isn't very good. The sound was hard to hear on some parts, and the picture was blurry. There were too many scenes that just weren't worth watching at all, and the few that were almost funny didn't make up for the others that weren't. I might be the only one, but I didn't see what was so funny about the King Tut song. I used to think Steve Martin was funny, but now I can't remember why..."
4,Differences between this and the other Panasonic network camera BL-C10A (msrp$199),"I had to delve deep into Panasonic's website to figure out the differences between this and the BL-C10A. There are only 2 reasons why this would be better: 1st, it has a wider aperture (f1.8) lens (vs. f2.8 for the BL-C10A), and it has a larger CMOS sensor (.33"") vs. .25"" for the BL-C10A. These differences mean that it will work better in low light, and should have a better picture overall than its cheaper cousin.On the minus side, it appears that it requires an external alarm or timer to trigger automatic FTP or email uploading of images, whereas the BL-C10A has those built in.Again, I have not used this camera, but rather the BL-C10A, and wanted to point out the differences. Overall, I am quite happy with the BL-C10A."
3,"Good value, but poor picture quality","I own the Dlink DCS-1000W and the Panasonic Network Camera, and under similar light conditions, the picture quality of the DLink blows the Panasonic away. The picture is very grainy on the Panasonic to the point where it is difficult to make out faces. The tilt/pan is cool, and if you don't care about the quality, then the Panasonic is a good buy. Otherwise, go with the Dlink.Buyer beware... Dlink has some firmware problems that results in bi-weekly reboots."
5,Great for the price,This kit contains a lot of useful and hard to find bits. Good quality - especially for the price. I recommend this product.
2,Don't trust pairing!,"If amazon pairs this w/ the security screws that you buy...BEWARE! I bought some spanner security screws and amazon puts this with it as ""buy both"" for $x.xx. To my dismay, the bit set had the right type, which I checked, but not the right size. The screws did not indicate which size bit would be needed. After receiving, I did further research as the box indicated the size. After looking at what a set with a spanner #14 would cost w shipping, I thought better about ordering. Instead, I went to my workshop, dug out a bit set that had been replaced, and fasioned my own out of a #12 flat blade bit with a dremel metal cutting disc. Worked flawlessly. Long story short, if you buy spanner screws and have a dremel, dont waste your money here!"
3,"Got the job done, barely.","I can't really complain about these, since they were so inexpensive, and allowed me to get the door panel off of my car. You certainly get what you pay for, though. I broke the hex head extension almost immediately, and the bits seem softer than I would hope for."
2,"Poor Quality. But, what would you expect for the price","These bits are pretty poor quality, especially the small Torx bits with the pin holes drilled in the center. The pin holes are actually drilled off center on the two smallest bits.For the price, they are fine, and meet my intended purpose. But look elsewhere if you need a longer lasting, or precision bit set."
2,poor quality,Find something better. This may or not work depending on your luck as to the quality of the piece/s you are specifically after.
2,"Cheap Chinese junk, but some of them work","About 60% of the bits are usable. All but two of the Hex bits are so badly cast that they're basically round, and the holes are all drilled off centre. The larger Torx bits are ok, but the smaller ones are about as much use as the hex bits. I have so many Torx and hex drivers, that it doesn't bother me - but if that's what you need, then don't expect much from this set. The other bits are reasonable and have done the job so far. They're all labeled CRV, but I suspect Carbon Steel. Not bad for a fiver (but don't pay shipping, just go to harbour freight)."
1,20 PIECE SECURITY BIT SET,12 pieces of this Security Bit Set are metric and SAE hex keys. Most buyers probably already have Allen wrenches which are the same.The quality of the castings is not very good. Look for something better.
1,Poorly made cast bits,"These bits are cheaply made. Granted the set only costs four dollars but even for that I would expect better quality. In the set I received, most of the center wholes for the hex and torx bits were off center. Worse yet the hex bits and the smaller torx bits hardly met the proper shape (weak corners and points). One of the prong bits still had excess casting metal between the prong points.Overall I strongly recommend splurging for one of the thirteen dollar sets."
4,Alotta bang for your buck,This set is definitely cheap both in cost and construction. The security holes are not centered and the metal seems a little on the soft side. This is not a tool set I would buy for regular use but is perfect for me where I use it only very occasionally. I would certainly recommend it to someone in a similar situation!
1,junks,"Most of the bits have off centered holes, so does not fit. Very low quality.I hope amazon has zero star rating."
1,Too Short to Work,Unfortunately these tips are too short to reach the screws. Therefore they were useless on two of the four screws on the back of the xbox 360 controller.
1,not worth the price,If you are looking to buy this product DON'T. i found this same thing at my local O'reileys auto parts store for half the price before shipping and if you are using it on 360 controllers they will not fit in the two bottom screw holes. i ended up ordering a t8 and t10 for about $1 each. Why buy a 33 pc. set if you only need a few. and i did not have a tool (other then a vpx drill) that fit the bits or the extention
1,You get what you pay for . . .,sometimes I wonder if China sends all of the items that do not pass their own quality control over to the U.S. I needed a T15 security bit so I bought this set - the machining of the security feature was so off center I couldn't use it. Many other of the bits are of similar poor quality.
1,Security Torq and Hex Bits Off-Center,"Don't bother buying this product if you need security torqs or hex bits. The holes are off-center on most of them, making them of no use for their purpose. There's obviously very little quality assurance with the maker of this product. Spend your money on a better product."
5,Good set of uncommon bits,"It's a good set of uncommon bits. The only thing missing was the driver, but if you're ordering such a special set of security bits, you probably already have a driver. There isn't too much to say about this. The bits are of good quality, and it's nice that the holder has a cap for them, so they don't fall out. Many sets don't have the cap."
2,Poor Quality ... Cheap Price Though.,Most of the security hex and torx have irregularly drilled center holes. Many holes are shallow and will not fit. OK for $5 as the spanner and tri are OK. Cannot recommend.
3,Okay for the money,"I bought this cheap little set of bits in order to supplement the larger set (bought at the same time)... in case I broke a few of the other bits. The case is made of a rubbery plastic. It's very cheaply made. Like I said, I bought this set primarily for individual bit replacement purposes. There are most certainly higher-quality sets available."
3,holes a bit off center,"In general the set was okay for the modest price, but as others have noted some of the holes were slightly off center, so quality control is a bit lax."
3,gets the job done,"Very cheap security bit set. It got the job done, but you can tell they were not built to the highest standard of craftsmanship."
3,Poor quality but probably adequate for infrequent home use,"I was trying to determine if I should order this product given the general negative feedback from the majority of the other users. I simply needed a particular secuity bit for a one-time use. You can't beat the price! Having said that, the bits are indeed very poorly made with off-center holes, etc. and may not work as intended for many security screws beause of this. In my case, the hex bit did (barely) fit and accomplished the intended use, hence the ""3 star rating."
2,Good Idea Poor execution,"Good Idea Poor executionI make knives from scratch and from kits. I got this bit set because the knife kits use Torx and the spanner style screws. The kit does not have a small enough Torx, and the torx that I used stripped out and crumbled when I used it on the pivot stud screw. This is not a high torque screw. The spanner bit also broke. The larger bits seem to hold up better BUT for the work I am doing it was a waste. Maybe I got a poor set and it was a fluke, but I was definitely not happy with the quality. The package is nice if only the quality matched."
1,Extremely Poor Quality,"This bit set is absolutely awful. You can plainly see that the relief for the security posts are off-center, the castings are abysmal and they don't fit most of the screws I deal with. What more do I need to say? Total waste of money on cheap Chinese garbage."
3,"Not great, but worked","I needed one of the security star bits for a part on my motorcycle. This tool worked fine to remove and replace the 2 bolts I needed for the project so I was happy. They were how ever cheap and lots of the bits had off center holes luckily the one I needed to use was good enough to work. The bit holder didn't work at all the shaft just spun inside the outer holder part. Might be handy to keep around in case I come across another one of these ""security"" bits again but if you had to use these things more than rarely I would suggest you find a better quality product. For the price I can't complain."
2,not to good,Poor quality not good center hole on some bits not in center. Does not look like they would work well. Had to return them.
2,Just buy the bit you need,Needed Torx #10 screwdriver and I saw that this set costs little more than that 1 screwdriver.Fast-forward to the actual job and the #10 Torx was a little too small for the job and screwed-up all my screw-heads to the point that I was unable to screw them back-in after taking them out (had to buy new screws).The morale of the story is that if something sounds too good to be true (30 precision bits for the price of one) it probably is too good to be true.The other lesson for me was that if I needed one tool I don't need to buy 29 other that I don't need?
1,Poor Quality,"The set I got were molded incorrectly and don't work properly. Don't purchase this item, move on and get something different."
5,33 piece security bit set,Fast service. I am very pleased with this purchase. This set is a must for anyone who works on electronic devices. Hobbyist need this set.
1,"Mis-shaped, poorly made, unusable","I bought this for the T8 security bit. Unfortunately, I used the bit on a hard drive screw and it stripped itself (not the screw!) after one use. Once screw. Not one hard drive. I'm going to but a different torx security set like Anytime Tools SMALL TORX SCREWDRIVER SECURITY TAMPER PROOF HOLE T5 T6 T7 T8 T9 T10 T15. I recommend you do not buy this."
2,Just not right.,"The extension will spin when you don't want it to. It is a hex tool pushed into a round hole. The hex bits with center holes...... not good at all. Holes not nearly deep enough, nor are the holes centered. Had I not ordered 2 sets I would have been up a creek."
2,"Was hoping for cheap usable bits, but quality is too poor to use","Some of the big bits are ok, but most of the bits have the holes drilled off center. The T8H is unusable and was the main reason I got this set."
4,"Great product, soft metal","The bits are good, could be longer, but the metal is a tad soft. I stripped one of the notches on the t8 screw, and the holes in the torx screws aren't centered (im not sure if they should be?). Other than that, it was ok; just be careful with the amount of pressure put into your screwdriver."
1,"Lots of Quality! Unfortunately, It's All LOW!","I should have paid more attention to the other reviews of this security bit set, but I needed something in a hurry to try to get into an older Seagate external drive enclosure. I ordered it and hoped for the best.That turned out to be a $4.00 mistake, for sure. When the package arrived today, I couldn't believe my eyes at the bits of misshapen steel the set comprised.This bit set may actually be useful as a set of small fishing line sinkers, but for the stated purpose, it's truly laughable. Before ordering these, check your local dollar store; you're more likely to find a usable set of security bits there. But then again, beware: you might find a set of THESE hanging from the display hook."
2,OK for $4 but don't pay more,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap.The holes are off-center on the bits. The hex bits I tried had to be forced into the screw head - marring the tip of the bit proving they were off size somewhat. I returned mine and bought another mfg bits"
3,Cheap driver bit set,"Purchased to have a handy bit set in my tool bag. This set was cheaper than many ""non-security"" bit sets and I just wanted an assorted bit set. Looking at the bits closely, I can see that the security features are not centered and/or symmetrical, so they may not work well for security fasteners (as advertised), but they work fine for standard torx, hex...... etc."
2,cheap price = cheap set,The larger bits are okay but any smaller sizes the holes are off center. The case is great though. I switched out these security bits with better quality bits. If you are looking to only use one or two bigger sizes then get these. If you are using them work multiple projects then invest in something that is of higher quality.
2,bits not manufactured to precision,"This security bit set is a bargain for sure, but do not expect precision from all the bits. The smaller sized torx bits have the security hole off center, and a circular tip instead of a torx 6-star tip. Needless to say, it will not fit properly. I ended up returning the set and ordering a more expensive craftsman set from Sears. Sometimes you need to pay to play. I give two stars because the return was relatively painless, this product was a disappointment."
1,Very poor quality Item!,"When I buy tools over the internet, I expect good quality. The bad kind I can get it close to my home. This Item is of a very poor quality, it is worth spending a little bit more money for something better."
1,Bad quality,"This is a miserable product. The quality is awful, you cannot use this if you're a professional. Most bits won't fit."
1,Poor quality tools,"I bought this set for the tamper proof (safety) bits. All the holes are made off center so dont really fit without effort.Out of all my tools in my collection, this is the poorest quality product I have purchased to date.Highly dissapointed, but then again, for the price I should have expected this...."
5,Good bit set.,I needed this kit to open my microwave and it worked great. The item arrived on time and it was described correctly.
1,Terrible Quality,"This set is cheap and you get the quality to match. The bit heads are so ill-defined that I have to read the etched-in name to tell which one it is. I will admit this problem is likely a result of me needing the smallest bit (Torx T8) but the star arms on the bit are so under-defined that it wont't even turn my screws and the Hex bits look to barely have corners. I doubt they'd work either. On top of this issue, the holes drilled into the bits are not at all on center, so if you need to get into a security screw that requires that hole, I wouldn't count on this set. Basically I wouldn't count on this set to do anything."
2,Poor Manufacturing,"Unfortunately, the bits in this set are poorly manufactured. Holes are off center, the red case has injection molding residue, and the bits are often difficult to remove from the case. Good concept, but very poor execution."
1,Junk- don't bother,"As another reviewer stated, the security ""holes"" are visibly off-center in many bits. May work, but why not get a set from a relatively good manufacturer?Was going to take a photo looking down on these toys in their holder- but more effort than they deserve <grin>."
1,Not precise,All but one of the torx bits had off center holes. Good thing the one I needed for an Xbox controller was centered. Not even worth the shipping to return it.
2,Junk,Well the bits are not tooled right meaning there still is chunks of metal in the bits. The torx's center hole is off center i would avoid this and spent a few more dollars and get something else.
4,"Solid bit set, work nicely","I personally like this bit set. I know others have complained about them not fitting into their Wii's, etc. but I've personally not had any issues with them on the things I use them for. So I'm not going to cry about that :)"
1,poorly made don't work,not a single bit in this set was made right. I wish I would have read the other reviews before I ordered but live and learn! the holes in the torx are off center and the tri wing bits are flat on the end and wont fit in the screw heads. the molding is so bad that the smaller bits are just round with no shap to them to grip the screws so they cant even work for non security bits
2,poor quality,"The 10mm spanner bit had flashing (like on a plastic model) I guess as a result of the machining process. Every single hole in the end of the bits was off center, you can see this in the photos by looking carefully. The red case is rubbery and has a lot of flashing, it does hold the bits secure with the lid on or off. This is an example of cheap Made in China manufacture at a cheap price. I would not buy this set again."
3,Nice set - not for the Wii,"This seems to be a decent set of security bits. Unfortunately all of the tri-wings are too large for my Wii which is what I needed them for. Oh well, I'll keep them since they will probably be useful for something else in the future."
3,It's okay but not precision,"I almost bought this (again) for the Tri-wing bit. Then I realized I already owned it. When I tried to use it, the bits were too big. None of the tri-wing bits are small enough to use on the small screws in Nintendo, cellphones, etc.For other uses, it has been a handy bit-set."
3,useless but cool,"I bought this set mostly for the tri-wing bits so I could use it with my Nintendo gear, but the tri-wing bits are tapered instead of flat, and so don't fit into Nintendo screws. I'm sure I'll find a use for the bits eventually..."
2,Cheap bits,"These particular bits strip easy and you should expect to only get a couple of uses out of each. The bits rusted in less than a week. Also to be noted is that the bits are deformed, leaving some of the bits completely nonfunctional. I would spend the extra money and get a better made set."
1,Terrible Quality,"At least two of the bits are off center. The back of the box describes a pair of pliers, not the bit set shipped. One of the bits was already broken and the steel was peeled back like a lemon rind."
1,Cheap Quality,I bought this bit set for the #10 spanner bit and it broke on the second screw I used it on. There is no warranty offered by the manufacturer. Too bad that there isn't an option to leave zero stars.
3,Good starter kit...,"Nice little set to get me started, but I had to purchase a bigger set with more bits for more detailed jobs. This kit needs a hand screw or a driver for hard jobs."
2,Poor Quality,The lack of precision of these tools make them useless when working with small items. The ridges on the Torx bits are not pronounced enough to grab the screws.
4,I has some basic stuff,This is not a kit to open anything. Just some things. The bits will break if you have to apply a lot of pressure and torque. But they work for what they are intened to do.
1,"Cheap Quality, Not Precision Bits","These bits are not well machined and although they seem to work for light use, they do not hold up and they are not great fits. Spend more on a better set -- I bought these (got them in the mail today) and now I have to upgrade already."
3,You get what you pay for,"The product is poorly made, how ever I got the use i wanted out of it, if You are not planning on using this bits frequently this might be what you are looking for, if you are using them regularly I would invest in products of higher quality."
1,33 pc. Security Bit Set,This 33 pc. Security Bit Set is not for the professional. It is rather a set of the Security Bits available at the lowest price possible. Very low quality.
2,Rounded torx bits? Seriously?,"Plenty's been said already about the lousy manufacturing quality on these things. One thing I didn't see mentioned: most of the bits are rounded off at the tip. They're even rounded off about the same amount for every size, which makes no sense at all -- all it's going to do is grind out the screw head a little, although given how soft the bit steel is they might grind the bits even rounder in the proces."
2,Poorly Made,"The holes in the center of the torx bits are drilled off center and won't turn tamper-resistant torx screws. They still work in torx hex screws that don't need the hole, but spend a few more dollars on a tool that will do what you need."
2,"A good thing to have, but these are cheapos for sure.","The first thing that I noticed is that the two different sides that constitute the ""case"" don't fit together firmly. Both sides just kind-of stick over the bits, to the side that is over the actual heads of the bits isn't stuck on well at all. Not a huge concern.The thing that is relevant about these is that because they're security bits, they have holes in the ends of them. Because they're cheap, the holes are not in the middle. Simply put, In many cases these aren't actually even going to work on those screws. On top of that, they're not very hard metal and easy to strip the bits (not the screws). Disappointing, but not really for $4."
5,Do it yourself,"Ideal for fixing ""disposable"" pieces of electronics that cost more to fix professionally than to replace. Great set of unique secure drive heads for may applications"
5,A Gorgeous Book On Pakistani Textile Printing,"This book is a marvellously illustrated history of Pakistani texitle printing from the area of Sindh.Anyone interested in textile design, printing or dyeing or art history of South Asia will be fascinated by this book. The Ajrak printed textiles have been found in the tombs of Egypt but are still being printed today in Pakistan. The use of indigo and alizarine is outlined as well as the development of the designs."
2,Full screen programming with Direct3D,"Before you buy this book, consider this book only covers full screen graphics. According to the author full screen debugging is nightmare if you don't have dual monitor. Obviously you will not benefit if you do not have it. The main engine to run his applications needs the class CConsole, which he never/very little talked about it. I only know C++, but if you are not a C++ programmer, defiantly God will help you, but keep asking to the God along with dual monitor. I do not know why this book is so thick with 862 pages? I was not expecting Windows knowledge, which half of the book covers. It has 16 chapters, but actual examples are only for seven chapters. Well the information is good in seven chapters, and if he had given information in his all 16 chapters, it was worth 5 point. I think we have to be kind and give fair rating and calculate points. Now according to mathematics it worth 7 (code for chapter) * 5 (Total points) / 16 (Total chatters) = 2.1875 points."
2,Back to MSDN,"When I purchased this book, I bought it solely on the reviews it aquired. However, when perusing the contents of the book, I found something quite unsatisfying: Half of the book is available online for free at gamedev.net. The author literally cut and pasted his articles from gamedev.net and called it a book. Not only this, but the author's discussion of some extreamly basic concepts is terrible. For example, when explaining the projection matrix, the author gives the reader a half of a paragraph discussion with no examples. The only reason this book gets two stars is because the chapters on collision detection and physics are pretty good, and even they were written by a different author. I hate to say this, but this book makes me appreciate Peter Kovach's Inside Direct3D."
3,Beginners book,Good introduction to 3D programming using DirectX. Advanced techniques are only briefly touched upon.
2,Tough,"I read about 100 pages of this book yet.I cannot understand where other reviewers find this ""simplicity"" and ""clarity"" in this book.I had to reread every sentence a few times just to understand what author is trying to say. Also - it is difficult to follow his line of thought (I am comparing with Lamothe's book ""Tips and tricks of game programming gurus"").From 500 pages - 100 pages is appendix.The only good thing - is that book is about DirectX 8, not 7. However samples are from SDK, and these are simplest samples of SDK. I think I was better off just printing out SDK documentation and studying it.If you know DirectX well - then buy this book, but then again - this book is ""BEGINNING Direct3D Game Programming""..."
2,Not explained well at ALL,"This book does not have any coherency at all. The subjects, chapters and notes are all plopped together, seemingly with no apparant cause and no explanation as to why they're there or what they do.If you want a REAL Direct3D book that explains everything from beginning (first Windows program) to end (a powerful Direct3D engine) i highly recommend picking up a copy of The Zen of Direct3D Programming - Walsh, actually in the same seiries as this book, though why you would get this one is beyond me."
2,Not what i spected,"Fellows we still not have good books for Direct3D even in version 8.0, Im tired of spending my money in this kind of books that doesnt teach nothing just over and over same thing, If you want to learn the Api go with in DirectX SDK there are a lot of Docs so you can start easy with it, I think we spect another kind of books for Direct3d kind of Lamothe books but using Direct3d in this day's, Anyway i think i have to use Direct3d by my own, Not help yet with it, or I'll keep just OpenGL for renedring my apps and games thats a Great Api very standard and a lot and a lot of good books, samples, articles and so on!.Sorry Wolfgang F. But comunity spected antoher more useful title."
1,Not for beginners,"This book is not self-explanatory. This is just another one of those books in which authors show off their skills, but not enough skill to explain things like a teacher would."
5,It's the best,"Never try to leave your house without this book. Every page is important. You will get the big picture on Direct3D programming with ... tataaaa ... Direct3D 8, not Direct3D 7. You won't miss the appendices, which show you how to program your own framework with a Win32 skeleton, that is optimised for game programming. Something substantial, that most of the other books didn't even mention. This book gave me a good start ... I love it. It is one of those important books, that I bought two times, so that I can do with the first copy whatever I like :-). Have fun, reading it !!!"
2,probably useful but pretty tough to read,"I found this book really just too hard to read and I'm a native English speaker (I wonder how that French guy read it so well?). There's a lot of info thrown at you all at once and I found a lot of the explanations truly hard to get through. None of them are laid out clearly and simply. It's written in a kind of caffiene-infused, hyperactive style that mentions a lot of concepts but bounces from one to the next before the first one is solid. And the MS style coding is annoying to those new to 'Microsoft-speak'. Maybe I'm just used to reading O'reilly books.I've returned it at this point but I may buy it again if I can't find anything better. I might check out the similarly geared book by the same publisher on OpenGL."
1,Do yourself a favor and browse through it before you buy,"Really, the title of my review says it all. Considering so many other people say it's a great book, it must have its merits but I sure can't see what they are. It's awfully written, it contains on average about one mistake per page, and I don't think it explains the concepts very well --on the contrary. It's incoherent, the index is awful (try looking up terms such as RGBA or RHW), and so is the printing.I strongly suggest you don't buy it based solely on its rating, as I did. Instead, browse through the book first and see if you like it. I wish I had done that..."
1,There are better alternatives,After purchasing this book I was left rather disappointed. Being an experienced developer I was looking for a book with useful examples to help overcome the game programming entry barrier.This book is nothing more than a simple Driect3D reference book with somewhat unconnected examples. The Zen of Direct3D Game Programming is a *MUCH* better book (read: 5 stars).A further thing to note is that after reviewing the chapter on Quake 3 models (md3) I embarked on a small project to render/animate these models. Unfortunately the book didn't cover the material in depth enough to do this (and was in fact incorrect with respect to the md3 format). I sent an email to Wolfgang asking for assistance. It's now been over 2 months and I haven't heard a word.I will not be buying any of this authors books in the future.Aaron Thomas.
3,Warning: this book can be extremely confusing.,"This book has been enjoyable, but it was obviously published in a hurry--the author and editor should be ashamed. It reads like a rough draft--there are mistakes _everywhere_. Mistakes in the formulas, inconsistencies in the interfaces, and other glaring errors. Often times I was left re-reading a sentence multiple times, trying to discover the author's meaning.What's even more frustrating is that the author seems to skim over some subjects that require more explanation (the section about quaternions, for example). I was also left wishing that there was more sample code included with the book.The saddest part of all of this, is that even given the books glaring mistakes, it is still one of the best books out there on the subject. However, I can still not justify the money spent on this book. I think the free information on the web (the directx documentation, msdn, and the tutorials all over the web) is probably a better bet."
3,No initialization chapter?,"After reading the first 5 chapters - twice, I still don't know how to initialize direct x graphics. This little tidbit of information seems to have been skipped completely.Other than that, the rest of the book is filled with fairly useful information.Don't buy this book if you are completely new to Direct 3D as it will leave you with a big throbbing headache and a hole in your wallet."
4,Good Product,"My 3 year old daughter loves her new growth chart... I didn't realize that it was a ""cling-on"", so I was actually disappointed that I couldn't write on the wall next to her height... instead it comes with age stickers, which can be removed. So, it is not a ""permanent"" record - especially for a young child who may enjoy moving the stickers around. It came with a ton of stickers - more than enough - and my daughter enjoyed decorating her wall with them."
3,Not very good anymore,"The good: I've had this gamepad for a couple years now and it still works like new. It's solidly built. The game that comes with it (Motocross Madness) is fun, and a good demonstration of the tilt control.The bad: It doesn't work in the game port under Windows XP. The driver software doesn't work under Windows XP. You can still use it in the USB port, but without driver software you cannot calibrate the tilt control. Not that it matters, because the tilt control is less useful than you would think. It's too easy to go from full left to full right, making car-racing games an exercise in zig-zagging. In fact, Motocross Madness is the only game I've found in which you can reliably use the tilt mode, so I basically keep tilt mode off. Also, the direction pad feels cumbersome. It's really hard to go from left to right without putting any up or down in between. In some games, it makes you want to revert to the keyboard.Summary: built well, but for XP there are tons of better choices."
3,"Good quality, but bad d-pad","The quality of everything is very good and it's tons of fun to play any computer racing with this gamepad. I've used this a lot, and it still looks brand new. Even though this has lasted long, when I use the d-pad for a non-racing game, I get a killer thumbache. After an hour of playing, my thumb hurts so much. It would be better if they designed it with a control stick or a better d-pad instead of that annoying one. This gave this product a three star rating. I would still recommend this to a friend though, because this controller is great with racing games and the controller is of the highest quality, except for the d-pad."
1,Not what you think it is,"Just to let people know, that this isn't what you think it is.It's not by the film director David Lynch who also composes music but by a different person entirely, so don't expect too much in the way of original quality.Some may argue that it is legitimate to use a famous person's name to market your work (especially if it happens to be your own name as well) but I disagree. This sort of thing misleads fans of the real Lynch and should not be encouraged"
5,"not ""the"" David Lynch... so what?","Yes folks, David Lynch is a common name. Don't be surprised by the fact that there are more than one alive!And don't be surprised by the fact that there is another equally talented artist by this name. The music is heartfelt and meekly sublime."
5,Fits the phone and looks good,Fits and functions like it is suppose to. The picture is a little different than what you receive. The cover over the ear piece is not a big clear plastic window. There is a smaller window that allows the clock and camera to be seen/function.
4,Good headphone,"A great headphone for this value. The headband is a bit tight at the beginning but will becomes comfortable a few weeks after you start using it. My only complain is the included microphone is a bit too noisy. Please note that they are no longer include the bias supply so for those people that need it, you will have to get it from Koss directly."
2,Dirty Talkin',"A cheap attempt to capitalize on Austin Powers' popularity. There are a couple of cuties (working out with a friend/baby oil massage cuties), but otherwise a dull video and with rather poor picture quality. On the other hand, the interviews with the performers (most of whom seem to be dancers in, uh, real life) contain all sorts of dirty talk that you normally wouldn't hear in a Playboy Video. Nudity is pretty acceptable in the British media, so these girls seem less innocent than their American counterparts. Plus they talk about their vibrators and how they like their shagging. But, that's probably the most interesting thing about this one."
2,"Clumsy, Coffeehouse Rock","""Cookie Mountain"" is an all-around mediocre album that, despite obvious passion and earnestness from the band, will age pretty badly. Most songs have little to no vocal imagination, the lyrics are bland, clunky and rhythmically sterile. Like a lot of music nowadays, TVOTR fuse a wide variety of genres, etc., without coming up with any memorable sound of their own. As for the ""genuine, anthemic songwriting"" the Amazon writer has promised, there is none to be found. Most of the songs drone on without any worthwhile catharsis. That said, ""Cookie Mountain"" isn't a painful listening experience, it just has no personality--it's safe, it's fashionable, will make most of the ""Best Of"" lists of 2006 and in one year will be entirely forgotten."
4,harleyboypaul,"I CD is great, but the bonus tracks have a glitch were there are around ten 17 second blank tracks, before you get to the bonus tracks. So that's why it was cheaper than the regular CD? Oh well, anything with David Bowie gets my vote."
2,Its over when the fat lady sings,"..or at least thats what the vocals on this album sound like. It's too bad too because this would be an otherwise nice indie/experimental record if it weren't for the grating, fingernails-on-chalkboard style vocals."
3,Eh....,"I bought this CD, as I sometimes do, because of one song I heard. In this case, Wolf Like Me. That song is a fine, fine tune with good synth sound and a nice peppy melody. The rest of the disc, as so often happens, was a bit of a let down. If you really, really liked Wolf Like Me and were hoping for more of the same, my suggestion is to just get the single."
4,A grower,"Beneath its dense sprawl of guitars, samples, beats, and everything else under the sun, lies the perfect album. Thought provoking, musically rich, experimental and accessible (I even heard ""Wolf Like Me"" on KROQ). You couldn't ask for anything better from these guys. Finally delivering on the promise of the Young Liars EP, TV On The Radio create their own personal masterpiece. And despite its accessibility end up sounding like no other band or album. The addition of a drummer and bassist have clearly helped to flesh out what used to be top heavy sound collages into full fledge songs. After repeated listens, Return To Cookie Mountain proves to be one the most engaging and involving records of the year."
4,Different but good...,"I gave this album a couple of listens and was glad I did. It's original but I am not someone who gives bad music a pass just because it is different - it has to be good too. I am a little surprised that ""Wolf Like Me"" was the first single since that song seems sort of flat and boring to me, but ""I Was a Lover"", ""Hours"" and ""Let the Devil In""(which was one of the only songs the Amazon reviewer hated) were all very good. And I can't believe everyone isn't raving about ""A Method"" which to me is an incredible tune(was someone channeling Brian Wilson?) that's worth the price of the album all by itself."
1,Sounds like someone stepped on their cat.,"While I am usually a fan of electronica (Thom Yorke is brilliant, IMHO), this band makes the mistake of trying to sing forcefully behind their music. Their singer's voice is enhanced electronically, which is neat for about a minute...then gets really annoying. Add to it the fact that he can't sing at all, and it's painful to get through the album. I don't know what these 5 star reviews are listening to...I think that they are just proud of themselves for liking something ""different."" It is different, I'll give it that. But different doesn't always equal good.""Wolf Like Me"" was the reason I bought this album; that and ""A Method"" are the only listenable tracks on the set. Bands like this are the reason why people download music. One or two tolerable songs, and the rest of the album is trash. Once I upload those two songs, I'll have a new coaster for my drinks. :)"
2,Sounds like a high school band experiment gone bad.,"The sound is not innovative - it's pretentious. The sound is not new - it's been done before, and done better.I gave this disc many spins, hoping that my ears would start appreciating what other reviewers have said, but it just didn't happen. I found it totally undigestable, and if this is what is supposed to be the new direction of music, then I'll stick with the old.Do yourself a favor, don't buy the cd based on all the glowing reviews here...listen to it first. I wish I would have listened to it before I bought it - now I'm going to sell my copy on Amazon...and there aren't very many cds I sell due to disliking them."
1,THIS ALBUM BLOWS!,I put the album on one side playing it through a speaker and laid out a garden hose 10 feet straight and put a tennis ball on the other end. This album sucks so hard that it sucked the tennis ball through the house so fast it went right through my speaker.WOW THIS THING BLOWS!!!
1,What the?,This was on the top rated albums of 2006 from many scources. I think Rolling Stone and Blender and a couple of other rescources I looked at praised this CD. Eclectic mix of blah blah blah.It sucks. Don't buy it. I listened to all the way through once (painfuly) and I will not listen to it again.
2,Snore!,Pretentious indie-rock. There is a lack of intensity somehow that makes this music boring to the point of unlistenability. Ok there are some interesting ideas but overall it does not gel somehow.
5,"Have a Review, Won't You?","Stop basing your purchases on written reviews or singles. Reviews are opinions of people different from you with biases different from your own. Singles are used to get close-minded peeps to buy the full album. Those close-minded peeps are often disappointed. Being open to cutting edge music doesn't mean you listen to ""Return to Cookie Mountain"" 12 times, say you ""tried too like it"" and sell it on CraigsList. It means you actually like it. Because independent of any review (I never heard any review, other that a local DJ telling an upset listener--who only liked ""Wolf Like Me""-- to listen to the album again and if he didn't like it, he'd buy it from him) I listened to this album loud on headphones and thought it was the best new, complete album I'd listened to in a long time. They didn't copy someone else and this isn't experimental. This is real, listenable music if you like music and not revisiting memories of other artists."
2,This isn't Rock nor Alternative; it's noise.,"Return to Cookie Mountain (with Bonus Tracks)I am disappointed in the album. I listened to closely to the reviews of fans and didn't listen closely enough to the samples. There is good music on the album but it is inconsistent within each song. No song is a standout as a good song either. If you want to listen to falsetto that drifts off-key and call it art, buy the album. I think there are better ways to spend your money in this economy. Sincerely, Tim McCanna"
2,Often quite unlistenable...,"If your average hipper-than-thou Village Voice rock critic created a band in a laboratory, it would sound precisely like this. (No, kids, that is not a good thing.)There are some interestingly written songs here - a few displaying that endangered species called ""melody"" - but even those numbers are mucked up with annoying studio-geek flapdoodle that's more bad Sonic Youth than good Radiohead. Add to this the most grating vocals since Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, plus 14 tracks of dead silence - each one titled ""Untitled"" and lasting 17 seconds - and you're on a long strange trip to art-school hell.Less production and pretension, and more simple songcraft...and maybe they'll be on their way."
3,When it works it is friggin' wonderful...,"...but when in doesn't, it really, really doesn't. I have to admit that if the review were based solely on the songs I really enjoy from this album it would be 5 instead of only 3 stars, but alas as a whole the album, for me at least, doesn't work. That is not, however, to say I don't respect these guys for trying something new. On the contrary, I think that their mistakes are brilliant attempts. That said, the songs that work are, as the headline says, ""Friggin' Wonderful"". ""I Was A Lover"" and ""Wolf Like Me"" are fantastic. The later of the two will definitely stay in constant rotation on my Nanopod for years to come(Not that the Nanopod will actually last that long, but that is another story all together). I would definitely suggest it to fans of the first. The album is a logical progression in their sound, and I can't wait to hear what they do next."
3,Bemused more than amazed,"So we all know the critics in England and the US just loved this CD (visit Metacritic for their 2006 'best of' to see the uniform adulation). So expectations were high when I played this for the first time... and the second... After a dozen plays I remain bemused. It's good, it has moments, but it definitely ain't great."
3,Beanie baby,Exactly what you would expect from a Ty beanie baby. It's very soft and cute. Nothing that blew me away but nice none the less
4,"Dark, unexpected humor in a fine first novel","You might expect a novel about a conscientious objector in 1968 to be grimly earnest -- but that's not the case here, where our narrator relates his two years of alternate service in an Illinois hospital with deadpan, even absurdist humor. The trivia of everyday life constantly intersects with the looming issues of the day, which are never presented in a heavy-handed or self-righteous way. Yet it gradually becomes clear that the absurdist humor is all that prevents the insanity & endless presence of death from destroying the narrator's world. You'll laugh out loud at quite a few passages; but you'll come away from these pages a bit subdued, a bit sobered. For those too young to remember that time, wanting to know something about it, this is an accurate recreation of the tone & atmosphere of those days. A novel urgently in need of reprinting!"
2,Rather a Disappointment,"Having failed, apparently, to properly interpret the title of this item (i.e., ""Lady in Waiting""), I had expected an exhilarating visual history of the great ship in her glory days. Instead, for the most part,what I got was many static pictures of the rotting ship interspersed with far too many earnest talking-head testimonials about how wonderful she was (true) and how she must be saved and restored (in our money-driven world, it ain't going to happen).Let us hope that whatever the fate of the UNITED STATES(most likely: being subject to the tender mercies of ship breakers in Bangladesh or India, the recent end of the beautiful former FRANCE) let's hope she doesn't wind up like the QUEEN MARY, which has been turned into kind of tarted-up corpse, complete with paper-mache funnels, or some such.If you're a true ocean liner aficionado, you'll find that visiting the MARY today is a really depressing downer."
5,"Even if you have no interest in ships, you'll love this movie","I admit that I have no interest in ships, and only watched this movie at the urging of people I trust. I am SO glad I did, because it was wonderful! I was caught up in the story immediately, and became riveted by this amazing story of the fastest cruise ship ever made. The reason the movie works so well is the way it is crafted, with anecdotes, comments, and reminiscences of people who knew and loved the ship, and stunning visuals of the ship in its glory days superimposed over stark images of the ship as it now rests, decaying slowly in the harbor. There's a great musical score that actually made me cry, especially at the end--and I don't cry easily. Look, all I can say is that no matter whether you love ships or wouldn't walk a block to see the Titanic if it reappeared out of the depths, you'll love this beautifully made, fascinating, funny, and astonishing movie."
4,A truly sublime recording,"I was hooked on this album from the very first song, ""Alasdair Mhic Cholla Ghasda"" a beautiful, spinning reel. After that, the haunting ""Fisherman's Dream"" could almost sound like a country-western song. ""Fosgail an Dorus"" is another traditional gem that makes you want to get up and dance, and the album ends with the transcendent ""Oh Mo Dhuthaich"". Karen Matheson's crystalline vocals and the sprightly, joyful instrumentation make this a record that never gets old."
3,"Some exciting traditional Scottish tunes, but marred by synthesizers","In the late 1980s Capercaille quickly distinguished themselves as the foremost Scottish ensemble for traditional tunes and Scottish Gaelic songs. SIDEWAULKS was one of their early successes. The title puns on waulking songs, a genre meant to accompany the beating of cloth. The rousing opening ""Alasdair Mhic Cholla Ghasda"" is a fine example of such songs. Lead singer Karen Matheson has stunning enunciation. The reels and jigs are performed with great confidence. Green Linnet has nicely provided the lyrics, with translation of the Scottish Gaelic materials.It is a pity that such a talented ensemble had to bring in synthesizers. While authentic folk music is timeless, synthesizers just make an album embarassingly dated in the 1980s. If Capercaille had done like their Irish counterparts Altan and stuck to acoustic instruments at this stage, SIDEWAULKS would have held up better over time."
2,Don't believe all the promises,"I bought this shredder for home use because of the cross-cutting and capacity for 5 sheets at a time. Well, it does cross-cut as promised, but good luck getting more than 2 sheets through at once. Maybe Fellowes meant 5 sheets of tissue paper. I wouldn't dare run a staple through despite Fellowes' claims that you can. The shredder automatically runs for 2 sec. after the paper has run through, to help clear the cutters, but after running a dozen sheets through -- one sheet at a time -- there was a massive clump of shredded paper jammimg the cutters on the underside. I don't need to shred a lot of paper, but even for small quantities, this machine just doesn't cut it -- literally. Spend a little more and buy something more heavy-duty than this little puppy."
3,3 star rating,"I thought the book was quite humorous and was extremly well layed out and plotted. It had a very good ending and alot of true emotions. Simon martin was a very confusing character as, he was always changing him and his emotions. Anne fine made the impression that simon was a real tuff lad but he isn't and i thought that was a very good twist."
3,Our Flour Babies Reveiw,"The book was funny in some places but very boring in others. the book is about a teenage boy who's father walked out on him when he was just six weeks old, but he starts to realize why he left him and his mum when he does a flour baby experiment, which consists of him carrying a sack of flour round for three weeks. The book is suitable for ages 10-14yrs."
4,Flour Babies Review...,I thought this book was a okay book. It wasnt my favorite. I thought this book was interesting when the character has to learn about how life is in the world and parenthood.The character also uses this weird project to figure out his own life like why his father stop being ressponsible;with a single mother who is raissing him. Kids and teenagers shouldnt treat their parents with dissrespect. I think this book is a funny and usual book. The character also experinces peer pressure with his friends. Read this book for enjoyment.
4,"The book I like ""Flour Babies""","What I thought about this book is it is very interesting.It made me not want to put the book down,even when we had to at school.It was very emotional.Simon he goes through a lot of emotions.Like when he first got assigned to the project he was sort of upset yet okay with it I guess.He was mad about his mom not telling him about his dad but I'm sure he did get over it.He was confused about what to do when he had to go to soccer pratice should he leave it there our take it with him?.He finally figured it out.That's all I got to say 4 now.Bye Bye :^) ;^)"
2,Flour Babies,"My book was about a teacher and his class. One day the class was being very rude. So Mr. Cassidy said one more word and someone will be picking a project out of the bag. Everyone was quiet and Simon walked into the classroom and made a noise. Mr. Cassidy gave up and he said pick a project. Simon put his hand in the bag and pulled out the project flour babies. Everyone was mad. Mr. Cassidy explained the project to the class, The class thought he was joking. Mr. Cassidy told them they had to keep journal about what happened with them and there flour baby everyday for 18 days. Mr. Cassidy told them that at the end of the 18 days they would have a official weigh in. He also told them that they would have to have a baby -sitter with them unless they couldn't leave them alone.18 days later they had there offcial weigh in. Everyone flour baby was the correct weight, except Wayne and Simon. No one finised there science fair,but Mr. Cassidy thouhght they learned a good leason."
3,Does not transalate,"I think the biggest problem I had with this book was the fact that my copy was published in the US, and the publishers, or possibly the author herself, made a few stupid changes to make the story take place here. The kids do not speak like American kids and the problems of the American delinquent are badly missed in the story. My other problems with this book, ones that should be problems on either side of the pond, are the timelines in the flashback scenes, and the round and overly aloof way everyone's problems are solved or forgotten in favor of a dramatic and prophetic conclusion. It's a good idea, it just not a great execution."
1,Very unentertaining.,The book seemed to go nowhere and was very unentertaining. There wasn't much action in the book at all. I don't recommend this book by any means.
2,Katie Caines Review,4c`s science project is on Flour Babies.The pupils have to look after a Flour Babie for 4 weeks and soon Simon Martin takes a liking to his baby.However the main thing on his mind is the Glourious Expiosion at the end of the project.Simon Martin gets all serious about looking after his Flour Baby taking it everywhere and everyone thinks he is mad.They are only looking after their Flour Babies waiting for the time to come for the Glourious Explosion.My favourite part was the ending because Simon Martin did not listen to anyone and just had the most exciting Explosion on his own in the middle of the hall.i really enjoyed this book but i have read better
3,A Summery on Flour Babies,"Summery:The Flour Babies is a book about a boy who's father has left when he was little boy ;he was ownly six week old .This story is about being a good perent in a small age. The children had a chose between some subjects the children chose the flour babies project, they had to look after the flour babies for three weeks which is 21 days..."
3,backroller,"I have owned a MAROLLER in the past and wanted a new roller. This is not as good as the ""official"" MAROLLER. It is lighter and not nearly as effective. I wish I had held out for the genuine article."
4,Truly a journey through time,These interpretations of Marc's music are wonderful. It took a while to get used to the classical approach but it works well and I am sure Marc would approve of the sonic landscape painted into these tracks.
1,No Mac OS support,"I have this drive (issued at work), and while it works fine in Windows, I will automatically give a non-OS specific device that does not function in Mac/Linux a 0 rating. There is no reason why Kingston couldn't make this drive work in other OS environments. Part of the usefulness of a thumb drive is the ability to move files between computers and across OSes, and this one fails the test."
3,Little Truckers Dream,"For a 2 yr old little boy who can be rough on toys. If he keeps dropping this toy like he does, it is going to break. He loves it to death like all of his other construction trucks."
4,Plastic is strong and will not rust.,"Its true that plastic seems flimsy. Steel is strong but it bends and does not rebound. ABS plastic can crack if under great forces. CA glue can mend all ABS breaks. Bruder toys has many parts on their toys that can be ordered from the manufacture if needed. Steel toys break and no parts available. Detail is very realistic on Bruders, Steel toys has no detail. I only marked this with 4 stars because price was a small factor. I have 6 Bruders and I am a collector now. Great education toys."
5,Love this Grader,"We bought this grader for my son's 4th birthday. We already have a Bruder tractor and bulldozer so I knew the quality of their toys. I was not dissapointed. This road grader was bigger than I expected, has many moving/removable parts and was my son's favorite birthday present. I highly recommend the brand, but especially this grader."
1,High Quality Plastic . . . Not Exactly,"Purchased this for a 3 1/2 year old boy. Was hesitant about buying any large, plastic truck, but we did not see any alternatives at the time we purchased this. We should have stuck with our instinct. When it arrived, we were immediately struck by the fact that the plastic seemed flimsy, and that many small plastic pieces that are attached to the grader appeared and felt so cheap and flimsy that we doubted they would survive 5 minutes of play, in our humble opinion. We were not going to wait to find out, and we decided to send this back. You can get a STEEL Tonka 18"" grader off of ebay for less than what Amazon is asking for this plastic thing. That's exactly what we did. Good luck!"
4,My son loves his gader!,"My five year old son loves his grader. He plays outside for hours in the dirt building his pond! I gave it four stars because I felt for the price, it should have been made from metal instead of plastic."
5,"Thanks, Amazon for quick delivery",My grandson all he wanted was a grader. So when it arrived I was totally surprised how big it was and the quality is supreme.Didn't have to go to mall and fight shoppers or where to look. It was delivered quickly.
3,just so so,"In fact ,I didn't like it at first, but after hearing it many times and ithought this band is a promising band , I guess their next album will much better this album, Because this album much betterthan their debut album."
4,Not quite as good....,"This is a great CD by a great band, don't get me wrong. It's just after listening to the excellent ""Introduction to Mayhem"" I expected a little more out of Primer 55. Still a great buy, and it only cost me $... on the day it came out at Best Buy! Any Primer 55 fan should own it, and definitely check out their older one. It kicks ...."
4,(the) New release,"This cd takes a bit of listening to like, but after you do its hard to stop listening to. The best songs are ""Growing"", ""This Life"" and ""Tricycle"""
4,Not Exactly Rap Metal,"Whereas P55's 1st album was nothing but overdriven rap-metal with no melodic sense whatsoever, ""The New Release"" sounds like a completely different band and puts most rap-metal to shame. Guitarist/main songwriter Bobby Burns uses many different musical styles, ranging from; funk ""Lou Evil"", reggae ""Texas"", and flat out thrash ""All In The Family"" to give the listener quite an entertaining record. Make no mistake, this is truly a metal record. Singer ""Jason""'s gutteral yells on ""Lessons"" are as true an indication as any. But its Burns' skillful playing and songwriting that make this group stand out in today's bloated musical climate."
2,Softies!,"Bah, Primer 55 should have stuck with what worked in Introduction to Mayhem - anger, heavy rhythm, and fast paced metal. Instead, they decided to take the other direction. I didn't like how they tried to combine, what I could only describe as, jazz and heavy metal. There were a couple/few good songs, but they had harsh language in these songs...and since I accidentally got the clean version, it ruined the album for me. If you liked the first Primer 55, I would only recommend getting this album if you can get it cheap AND with explicit lyrics."
3,Too bad Snot isn't still around,"Maybe if they were, this band would have fallen in line with their style and stuck around. After all, this cd does have moments reminiscent of Snot in some parts (though not as good), and the group as a whole had potential to be cooler. But oh well, stuff happens, right?Consider this if you like Grade 8, Snot, or Korn, as that's who they remind me of at times.Long live Snot's music, though, man. They woulda really crafted the music industry, if only, if only. RIP."
1,I'll pass.....,"I bought this cd with no idea what to expect. I took it home, and i started listening to it, and at first i was impressed. The first track was a very good song. There is my star, just for that song. The rest of the cd goes downhill VERY fast. uhg. What a waste of $.... Spare yourselves the trouble, and money: pass this one up."
2,a change but not a good one,"they changed a hell of a lot but im not surei t was for the better. one of the reviews said it takes some getting used to, and i onyl bought it yesterday so in a month maybe ill like it more. either way, whether i end up liking it or not, the music was better before, even if it did seem like they just wantedto be cool and popular,maybe they have matured, but somehow i still dont like the music...oh well, if youre a die hard primer fan, buy it, but if youre just someone lookin for a good cd, dont buy it, just download the songs"
2,Dissapointing...,"Primer 55's debut really amazed me, but now the singer doesn't rap anymore. And this CD isn't Primer 55 material, it maybe has 2 or 3 good songs on it, but that's about it. If you are a Primer 55 fan then don't waste your money, The New Release is a dissapointing Primer 55 CD."
2,"Yuck, I was disappointed","If you loved introduction to mayhem as much as i did, dont buy this piece of crap. It really Sucks bad. i was so excited to see the new album come out, but then what happened??? the singer no longer raps?? that was primer 55, good old rapcore. but now there like everyone else, but a little more easy listening. They changed drummers, so no more good aux percussin(tommy lee MOM kinda stuff) and no cool guitar breaks that makes you wanna bounce. I hated it, Waste of money"
5,Perfect Fit,"This bag is great; it is the absolute perfect fit for my Sony HDR-SR12. The bag fits the camera snugly with room for a few extra cables, spare battery, etc. All the bag you need!"
2,Not what I thought...,"I purchased this case for my DCR-DVD108 DVD Handycam because it said it was compatiable. When I got it, it was huge compared to the camcorder. I would have to put other stuff in there to keep the camera from shifting around everywhere. I was thinking since it said it was compatiable it meant that the camera would fit in there nice and snug to protect it, but that wasn't the case. It is a really big and bulky case. Unless you have a big camcorder and alot of attachments you want to carry around with it, I don't suggest this case."
4,"great bag, but needs more room for manuel","I am really happy with this camcorder bag. The camera, all of the cords, and extra dvd's fit perfectly in it, but I wish there was more room to put the manuel for the camcorder. It looks nice and I can't find much to complain about."
4,It is a good deal.,This carrying case is what I am looking for. Very suitable for my SONY DVD403 Camcorder.
4,Nice Camcorder Bag,"My Sony Camcorder only takes up a corner of the bag, but by the time you add tapes, power supply, batteries, other take alongs and special cables, it all fits quite nicely. Very satisfied."
3,Looking good but its big in size,I recently purchased every thing looks good one thing disappointed me was it is really big in size than I expected.
3,Shipping?,"I do not own this bag.Instead I write this to address S+H charges people charge. I live in Hawaii, this is not a crime. We should not be penalized for this fact. By penalized, I mean that Hawaii is a part of the U.S.A. but we are treated like we only have one airplane to reach us, and only on every other tuesday.I want to order this bag. Its $25 currently. MSRP is $115. Shipping costs thru USPS is probably under $10. The cheapest FedEx/UPS/DHL is probably around $15, yet 2 different 3rd party sellers want to charge me $25 or $47 for this bag. I order lots of things online. I know that sellers are using a lower cost price and padding the S+H, but this is rediculous.I wrote to Amazon about shipping rates and they basically just shrugged. I guess its off to Ebay or find another bag locally for me."
5,Sony case,"It's fairly large, can fit my regular camera in it as well as the camcorder.Been working good so far."
4,Good case,"Not a ton of extra room but plenty for the adapter, charger, and an extra battery. Relatively comfortable shoulder strap as well...would recommend."
4,Too big for today's cameras but a good bag overall,"I don't know when this bad was designed but it's far too big for 2005+ video cameras. I'm able to put 5-10 DVDs, a DVD video camera, a digital camera, and all the chargers in the bag. The quality of the bag and shoulder strap are excellent."
3,"This bag is great for local use, but not practical for travel...","Actually, I like this bag for short trips. It is nice-looking, compact, and is large enough for a few batteries, the camera, and lens cloths -- the camera fits snugly so it's not bouncing around; however, for REAL travel (which I needed it for), it isn't practical at all. I don't have the room I need for the extra lenses, etc. I bought for my Sony DCSH1. It would be great, however, for the smaller Sony cameras w/o many accessories."
4,Good case,"I bought this case to go with my Sony camera about a year ago. I have been very happy. My buddy is now looking into digital camera's and he wants this same case. I teased him for a while because I had it and he didn't.Overall, I think this case is very good. Rugged on the outside & soft on the inside."
4,dvd camera bag,nice bag...although no mishaps have occurred...I worried that the single latch may someday provide an opportunity for an expensive mistake to occur.
2,Misleading dimensions,"We just received this product and are quite disappointed regarding the size. It is advertised as 17""x17"". The base of this bird feeder measures 12.5""x12.5"" and the copper roof measures 15.5""x15.5"". Otherwise it appears to be sturdily built. Just beware the of the size discrepancy."
1,Bored To Tears,"After reading the reviews here, I was a little curious, so I listened to all the tracks for this supposed ""Acoustic"" CD on the free mp3 site. I must warn you that this album is pretty boring. The melodies are tedious and the beats are dull. I think that one of the problems why this whole album is boring is that the drums and bass were indeed simulated on some machine and end up having the same lifeless feeling throughout. The guitarist also tends to play mediocre solos. There are clearly some hypsters writing reviews here, trying to sell this product. They're probably the same guys whose job it is to call the radio station and try to talk them into playing songs or perhaps it's the artist himself."
1,"DEFINITELY, NOT WHAT I EXPECTED","This CD is light years in distant (remote) listening quality and technique when compared to Joe's other CD. I could not believe this was the same guy playing on the CD ""A Good Cup of Joe"". Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Identifying with Boundaries II,"I am working with issues about boundaries, and have found that I am caught in many addictive relationships and have very limited boundaries. This book has guided me on the path to have a stronger boundary around myself. This book is good, therefore I am purchasing one for my healing circle. If you have a problem with boundaries, this is one book to read."
2,Not what I was expecting...,"I purchased this book under the impression that it was about love addiction, and I suppose it does touch on the subject somewhat, but it is more geared toward Adult Children of Alcoholics, which I am not, and therefore, this book was not as helpful for me personally as I had expected it to be. I would recommend it for those who are, as the book does have some positive messages and potentially helpful advice. It just didn't resonate with me."
5,There are No Accidents,"Another encouraging book by Benedict J. Groeschel. Lots of encouraging advice. His experience makes one stop and think. In our day and age, trusting in God is the only way to live."
2,Shaky Ground,"There are several major weaknesses in the author's hypothesis. I read the book when it first came out, sent a copy to friends in Zuni and recently spent time there discussing the book with them. A few points are worth noting: There is no mention anywhere in Zuni oral history of the kind of contact claimed, very little input is evident directly from Zuni, except from Ladd and Nahohai.While the book may seem provocative to an outsider, it doesn't seem to have much credibility with those who know Zuni history.The larger issue of early migration routes fits with current thinking, but the quantum leap from the Pacific Coast to Zuni is a bit of a stretch. If there was contact, as claimed by Davis, why is there no link with Hopi?"
2,Weak hypothesis,"The only decent piece of evidence presented by the author that could be seen as supporting her thesis of a Zuni-Japanese connection are some apparent language similarities, and even with that she does admit that there is a problem with ensuring that her transcriptions of Zuni and Japanese words into the Latin alphabet are truly accurate representations of how the Zuni and Japanese say those words. The rest of the evidence ranges from intriguing-but-weak to downright laughable. But the book does offer some good background information on the Zuni people in general, which just manages to save it from being a waste of time."
2,The Zuni Enigma,"The author's thesis is compelling, but the information is conjectural and not fully developed in the text. I wonder if the Zuni people believe the author's hypothesis to be true?"
4,Interesting Thesis but Sketchy Evidence,"The author suggests that medieval Japanese sea-goers arrived just in time to join the Zuni Native Americans in their search for the center of the world. The Japanese, according to the author, were also on a search for the Western Paradise of the Jodo Shu and Shin-Shu Buddhists. Somehow these two searches became one and the Japanese group over time became part of the Zuni genetic and cultural heritage. Davis points to linguistic, genetic and cultural parallels between the Zuni and the Japanese, reconsiders ancient stories of the Zuni, and presents some dubious artifacts as evidence for her claims. I found myself wishing for more evidence more clearly presented. Still, the thesis is intriguing enough to warrant four stars."
3,Galwegian flair,"This is a nice CD. I bought it because I saw them live in Galway and wanted to recall the night. But I must say they were better in person than in this CD. As another reviewer notes, the instrumental tunes are better. But even here, there are times when they seem to jiggle over the road on whether they're more traditional, or more cork-jazz-modern, I don't mean to be deriding that, but there are times where it jars a bit, where I'm confused on the veer the music takes, and I don't catch up. In my movie/poem parlance I have to think and I'm out of it. Still worth a listen. Slan."
5,The Blizzard of 1888 and the effects on the East Coast.,"Another fine book for young readers by Jim Murphy. I was not aware of the history of the March, 1888 Blizzard on the East Coast and this very readable short book gave me the low down of the tragedy people had to endure when two storm systems met off the East Coast. The book focused the attention on New York, but other localities were also included. Several hundred people died as a result of this storm, so I was surprised when I read this book. The author modeled this book for young readers, but it can be of interest to the adult. In a short read, an adult can get a brief history of this terrible storm.A good little read for those interested in tragedies. The authors writings are smooth, and the flow is good. It is an easy read."
2,Not Impressed,"I have read numerous books on hauntings and the supernatural, and consider myself to be a believer. I found Hazel Denning's writing style to be very boring. I actually lost interest in the points she was trying to make about halfway through the book. Clearly the author is presenting only one side of the spiritual argument - which makes perfect sense as she is writing from her own experience. However, she tends to phrase her points as if she's presenting multiple perspectives(which she's not -- at all). I wasn't impressed. There are much better reads on the subject out there."
1,Yuck,I heard one of their other albums online and really liked it. So when I saw this one cheap I thought I'd give it a try. Nope. The singing doesn't match the style of music. I just didn't like it at all.
5,"Dynamic artist, energetic performer","I love this album. I own 4 CDs Christopher has put out as a solo artist, as well as one with his brother. I saw him perform live 2 weeks ago, totally unplugged. Christopher is a lively, passionate performer...to hear him transmit his love for his music through his guitar, drum and harmonica in a live setting is overwhelming. I laughed and cried as I watch him engage the audience and touch my emotions. This CD has a great sound. It is refreshing to hear music where the words are clear and well communicated. You'll find yourself humming these tunes and then breaking out in song when you least expect to."
3,Creative Labs sound card,"The product was purchased for use in a WinXP computer, and unfortunately it doesn't work. I am saving it for use in an older machine when the need arises."
1,AWFUL PEOPLE,I LOST INTEREST BECAUSE THE PEOPLE - VICTIMS AND PERPS - WERE JUST SO DISLIKABLE THAT I DIDN'T CARE WHAT THEY DID TO ONE ANOTHER. THE LEVEL OF GREED AND SELF-IMPORTANCE OF ALL THE CHARACTERS IS MORE THAN I COULD HANDLE.
4,Very good,I do like the book because it gives me details that I want to know of eah woman we are studying at my church. The book arrived on time and was like new condition. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
4,Women of the Bible.,"I purchased for gifts. I will perhaps purchased one more later. The people I gave them to, enjoy them and find them very interesting."
5,Very good ebook,I had the hardback book and loved it. I wanted the ebook to save space and handy when studying. Recommend for straight reading and Bible study.
4,satisfied,i have bought this book and it is a very interesting book i have learnt a lot and i would.recomend this book to anyone.
5,Woman of bible,This book is very helpfuyl in my studies of woman. And very informative and easy reqading.
4,I like it,It smells clean. Anything by joop I have been impressed with. The original I still think is best. But I am enjoying this one much.
4,This is an office favorite,"Nightflight is probably the fragrance that I'm complimented on most. When I was first introduced to this follow-up fragrance from the original Joop! I was quite amazed at how different the tone of it was. It has a vibrant, fresh, out-of-the-shower sort of appeal reminiscent of your favorite bath soap. It's masculine yet smooth, and bold enough to use only a hint. I find it suitable for use morning, afternoon or evening."
2,Very generic and lame,"Please dont buy this, Do not blind buy either. IT is very generic alcohol smell. Yes you get quite a bit for the price and that is why I gave it a 2 star and not a one."
5,Dreamy,Brought this cologne for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it. He has been getting comments from other ladies as well (not happy with that ). However this is a great scent
4,Great scent...just doesn't last like the other JOOP!,I love the smell..and wish it had the staying power of the regular Joop....but it's still an awesome scent...you just might need to reapply at a later time!
4,the flute is back!,"From the first track of Dwayne Kerr's Flutation, Street Jazz, I was left in no doubt that the jazz flute is here to stay. The rolling groove and smooth vocals of Street Jazz yield easily to the tender Flutation and it's smooth sailing from then on.One of the collaborators on this album is Madonna's former engineer, and old band mate of Angie Stone, Gordon Mack, who co-wrote the brilliant crossover track I Didn't Know. Dwayne himself is no slouch. Full-time member of Erykah Badu's Neda Stela band, he has still found time to produce an album that is complete and satisfying.I dare say there are some tracks on here that may well turn out to be classics, like the Janice Love Theme (written for his wife), A Piper's Dream (so mellow it's painful) and the aforementioned I Didn't Know.If you want to buy a jazz album that's different and will touch you in new ways, Dwayne Kerr is the man for you."
5,Where Kerr Pipes...Your Jazz Soul Follows!,"Like the Pied Piper, Kerr's ""Flutation"" and ""Higher Calling"" soulful raspy fluty notes mesmerize you from cut to cut as sweet addiction. Like those famous guitar riffs of the Isley Brothers, The Brother's Johnson, and Hendrix, Kerr's fast flute mix will stand the hairs on your neck, on end as you become keenly aware, you are listening to a master among masters.Absolutely outstanding is Kerr and the arrangements are spectacular. The songs are sexy, alluring, and move well beyond your hearing and into those deep visceral recesses of your smooth jazz loving soul. Those who think the flute is too soft, too wispy, to delicate and cannot be as sexy or moving as the Sax or Trumpet - or as thumping as the Bass....are in for a surprise!In my opinion, Kerr is Dave Valentin and much much more!"
4,"they sure ain't pretty, but they can sing","i bought this cd for my mom... she luvs almost every song... my mom always says about them... ""they ain't pretty, but they can sing"""
2,Good idea spoiled,"The idea of this book is excellent, and long overdue, but the author's foggy cloud of pop-feminist verbiage spoils the outcome and casts doubt over the whole project.You might, however, find the charts at the back worth the price of the book, despite their amateurish appearance."
1,Wrong product,Just got this product in. The product is falsely advertised or they flat out sent me the wrong thing. Instead of bits T7 through T25 they sent me bits T40 through T10... hardly useful.
3,Pricey shipping.,"Speedy shipping, but they charge twice the price of the actual bits to ship them. For some reason they chose to pack an item the size of a pack of Tic-tacs in a box large enough to fit Rosie O'Donnell's corpse."
5,A love story,"Japanese companies, for all their huge size and consensus decision making, sometimes display more soul than their US corporate counterparts. In creating the F6 masterpiece, Nikon knew they would probably not recover their development cost; film is over. But profit was not the point. The F6 is a love letter and an expression of gratitude for Nikon's rise to success through 35 mm SLR photography. The F6, almost certainly the end of the F line, is a parting gift from Nikon; the emphasis is on mechanical beauty and ergonomic perfection. Get one while you can; there will never be a more superb 35 mm single lens reflex film camera."
1,It's a no go...Will not work with Digital Media,"Camera will not work with CompactFlash or other digital media cards. You must buy a cartridge of tape, which allows for just 24 shots. No LCD screen for image playback. Extremely frustrated and returned item.UPDATE: After reading some of the comments, I conducted extensive research into ""film photography"" over the last two days and I now understand a fair amount about the subject. As a result, I have no plans to reorder the F6, but I do have a shipment of film canisters (Kodak) coming so that I can test them in my brand new Digital Nikon SLR. I think it is remarkable how old technology like filmstrips can produce resolution greater than my CompactFlash cards. Seeing will be believing."
5,Excellent celtic sounds!,I love traditional and modern celtic music and this CD has both with hauntingly beautiful female vocals as well.
3,Essence of the....,"Be careful about ordering this product. Not because of the music or tracks, I haven't had the fortune to hear any of it yet. Make sure you get the 18 track 20.00 CD (the one with the red leaf on the front)and not the $10.00 one."
1,dang. bad smell/taste,"I got these, because they were the ONLY brand I could find which didn't contain cyanobalmin (a type of b-12 which has been bonded to a cyanide molecule)unfortunately they smell so bad I can't bring myself to eat one, and my children are even further from tolerating them. uggg. We all need to start emailing regular vitamin manufacturers and asking for kids vitamins without little bits of poison in them."
2,"Great Music, Bad Distribution, Amazon!","Songs were improperly tagged. When I downloaded to my Zune, it showed the tracks on this album as 7 different albums! Same thing when I downloaded Loretta Lynn - Gold today. Please fix this."
5,"Sea Spell takes you on a wild, romantic, seaside getaway.","When Beth Caxton returns to her childhood home of Grey Gallows, hoping to take a break from the problems of the ""real world,"" she has no idea that her quiet vacation is about to be turned upside down by a sinister plot to destroy the sleepy little seaside town she loves. Even more surprising is the handsome, mysterious, man from the sea, Gordon, who is a pleasing mixture of raw sensuality, animal magnetism, and childlike wonder. Together they face the dangers of Grey Gallows and an out-of-this-world love that's destined to be."
2,GOOD--BUT NOT GREAT READING.,"IT IS A NICE LOVE STORY AND MAKES YOU LONG FOR A SUMMER ROMANCE. I HAVE ONE CRITICISM THOUGH, AND THAT IS THAT TESS FARADAY OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T KNOW THAT ONLY MEN HAVE ADAM'S APPLES. BETH CAXTON COULDN'T HAVE HAD ONE."
3,WELL,"The plot was okay so were the characters, my only complain was if there was alittle spice added between Beth and Gordon it would be terrific, still I enjoyed reading the book and Tess Farraday is a talented writer."
4,I enjoyed it!,"Beth had been a young girl living in Grey Gallows when she was rescued from drowning in her beloved sea. Somehow she knew her briefly seen rescuer had been a selkie!Many years later, Beth returned to Grey Gallows. She never knew the selkie had kept watch over her all those years. Beth was the mate he had chosen!*** A magical romance to sweep a reader of her feet! I read this one while sitting on the beach, listening to the waves crash upon the shore. Tess Farraday wrote in such a lovely way that for a brief time I almost believed in selkies. An unforgettable story! ***"
5,Best SpongeBob Squarepants Book,This is a great book to read. Readers will love this book if they are a SpongeBob fan. So read this book!Robert a fifth grader
4,technically amazing,"wow ! What a concert ! what a thrill ! Mamamia ! I'm always fond of live recordings. This is what I prefer. This one is tremendous. Two sets over 50'. Magical ! Here, the sound is perfect of course. You can hear the three masters very clearly. It's a panel of blues, swing and emotions. The synthesis between the three works fine. This is grand, this is beautiful, this is serious. No shooting the line. Fans of Larry Young, Tony Williams and Miles should get this one without hesitation."
2,DRUMMER GONE WILD,"If you are a Standards Trio Jack Dejohnette drum fan, you'll probably be disappointed in the CD. Apparently, Keith Jarrett has put the lid on Jack's drumming. Just keep the beat and throw in some interesting, but subtle, fills. When Jack runs his own groups, it's a different story. I've found this problem on most of his CDs. His drumming is so out of control that he unfortunately ruins the cds. Schoefield is great, as is Goldings. Jack, on the other hand, just bangs away. Nothing subtle here. A big, expensive disappointment."
1,Ugly in real life,"I bought this seat sock. It looked cute in the online photo, but in real life it is garish."
5,my favorite watch,I purchased this item well over a year ago. IT IS A FANTASTIC LITTLE WATCH!!!!!. I just repaced the battery on it. I use it every day. Have gotten many compliments on it. Still looks like new.
2,I loved playing Spyro games.............on the Playstation!,"After years of playing Spyro games on the Playstation,I was ecstatic that there was a Spyro game in the DS platform.I expected a full 3D enviroment complete with first person action,components that I adored on the Playstation versions of Spyro.But what I got was neither.The game differs greatly from other Spyro games I've played before.You control Spyro from what I would call an aerial view.You control Spyro's movements but you're not at the foot of the action.And the background is like a picture,it doesn't move,only the character does.I haven't even gotten through the first level yet and I can say that I won't enjoy the coming levels.In the beginning of the game,you save four elder dragons that help you in learning spells and special moves.This became extremely tedious for me.All in all,I would not recommend this games for others.This games is really not fun for me but possibly for others.All I can say is think twice before purchasing."
3,Just not like the ones on other systems...,"Truly, there's nothing wrong with this game. The graphics are all right, the game is pretty easy to understand, and there's that whole plot but it's just different on a play station or on a console. Not a bad game, just not my cup of tea anymore, I guess."
2,Why...,"Why... Spyro on the PlayStation 1 is brilliant, and Spyro on the GBA (excluding Spyro Orange) is not quite brilliant but still really good. Spyro on the PS2 (or GC or Xbox) is only decent... And now there's this. I was excited for this, I was hoping it'd be great like the GBA games or brilliant like the PS1 games. But... It's worse than the PS2 games. It really is. It's really easy and really short. The ending kinda leaves you hanging (and they never made a sequel to wrap it up?!), and some of the gameplay mechanics are just kinda poorly designed. Controls are odd... I own this and play this because I'm a Spyro fan, but if you are not a Spyro fan don't get this game. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
3,genre miix that works well this time,"This game has the RPG elements of leveling, and the fighting elements of being able to do more than just one attack. You can learn many fighting skills as well as breath skills. Overall I gave this 3-stars because: it is easy to catch on debris, it is hard to land properly because the screen might consider a cliff area part of the abyss causing you to die when you properly landed, and many secret areas have nothing to them.It takes about 2 days to get through the game with a maxed out level."
3,Just a Bracket,I would recommend using this bracket with a Ram mount. Do not try to place the bracket on your dashboard by itself because mine broke off in two places.
4,great item for the price,"I bought this a couple months ago, and it works great. My only complaint is the freezer bowl area is not enclosed during the freezing process, which I think makes the process take longer than it could, and perhaps not freeze the icecream as much as could be done in an enclosed freezer area. Also, nothing specific about this maker but you have to make the icecream a day in advance if you want it to be hard vs soft serve texture"
1,Doesn't Do the Job,"This ice cream maker has a nice look to it BUT... The freezer container does not get cold enough to make a firm ice cream. I have a Cuisinart and I found that the containers are interchangeable--the same size, bottom fitting, etc. I tried this out a few different ways using this container with the cuisinart, the cuisinart container with this motor, etc. I found that the Villaware motor is just fine. The problem lies with the cooling product in the freezer container. It does not stay cold enough to make ice cream! Kudos to Amazon for their excellent customer service though!"
3,Good but not great,"If you like home made ice cream and don't like the mess of ice and salt, this maker solves some of that problem. It does not freeze the ice cream very solid. So for very soft serve it works OK."
1,Don't waste your money,Even at $20 (the current going price on Amazon) these things are a ripoff.Despite trying to freeze the bowl in two different freezers overnight it still fails to produce anything even remotely solid.I think of this as my $20 lesson to never buy anything from VillaWare.
1,Too complicated!,"Unlike reviewer ""aswynes"", I DID buy this lame-o product -- so I get 1 star. If I could rate the product, I'd give it 1 star too!!! This thing is too hard to use! Let me get this straight: You're supposed to freeze the bowl for hours *before* you use it?! Then you're supposed to freeze the LIQUID for hours *after* you mix it! C'mon folks! I just want some ice cream, not a rocket science project!! Give me a break!! If you *paid attention* in marketing class, ice cream is an impulse item. Not something to plan your whole day around! (Plus it took me twelve hours to read the manual!). Next time make it ""doable""!!!"
2,depends what you want it for,"Just before dining, I like to put a slush of berries & sugar, etc. into the workbowl of an ice cream freezer, and when it approaches the end of the meal, serve it. It used to work quite well with an old salton device (that had a power cord snaking from the freezer compartment of the fridge) This item produces a sludge that needs then to be frozen for several hours to serve the next day.unsatisfactory for this use.Intelligent Design? Certainly pays no attention to evolution. This is too bulky for storage. If it were 2 pieces, a bowl that sits in the freezer and a base, that would be fine, instead it has the bowl in the freezer, the base, and a cover a little bit larger than the bowl, thus it takes up 100% too much storage space in my kitchen. Ain't worth the storage space for such an occasional item.unsatisfactory accessory.So why buy this one, when there are so many more compact designs available."
1,This ICE CREAM MAKER IS PITTIFUL... [...],"[...]Part duo of the horrible ice cream machine. We had a dinner party yesterday and again she wanted to make icecream... This time Her brother was coming over with his Fiance. The bowl was frozen for 5 days this time. Enough time to freeze a body I would think. LOW AND BEHOLD it made soup once again. But here is the kicker, her brother made the comment, ""oh yea, you're supposed to put it back in the freezer again and take it back out and redo it."" ERRRRRRRRRR I was fuming mad. WHY? because he read the reviews right here and saw the product was crap and the cuisanart was BETTER. How could you do such a thing... and the sad part is that they are the same price.I am going to call him now and ask where he got the darn thing so he can take it back and I can get her the cuisanart. I have half a mind to ask for the 1000 thread count sheets back.DON""T BUY THSI WORTHLESS PRODUCT... and yes, from what I could tell it was the bowl that is the problem."
3,"Looks Good, but....",I bought this because I had just been drolling over a Cuisinart that looked excactly like this. I had a Deni that was still worked and looked great. But this one was stainless... The first batch didn't freeze..I assumed it was because my bowl was only in the freezer for 8 hours....and the second and the third started to look like it might one day be Soft Serve..then it melted. I don't remember having these problems with the Deni. ( I have the Deni bowl in the freezer now hopefully it works as well as I remember it)
2,Not so great a buy,"I've made ice cream a coupla times, the second time I made sure the bowl was frozen for 3 days just to be sure I wasn't doing anything wrong. What I got both times was something like slush, which definitely does not translate to soft serve icecream in my dictionary. Does it matter what brand of heavy cream or half and half you use? Anyone who can help, I'll be eternally grateful to you... For me this was a good deal because I bought a coupla other things with it and used a coupon, so overall the price worked out ok, though I can certainly understand others' frustration re. the price and quality."
3,Ice Cream???,I have used the VllaWare V5100 of and on over the years but have not been satisfied with. I eventually just stopped using it over all. I'm in the market now for something that actually makes ice cream not something that is close enough. I don't recommend it.
1,totally inadequate,"Despite precooling all the ingredients before and after blending, I have NEVER gotten this maker to freeze the mixtures to ice cream. Try a different brand."
4,Great for the price,"Works very well except that the cover does not sit properly and had to be weighted down. For what I paid, it's a bargain anyway. UPDATE: Got the cover to sit properly. This is a good product."
3,Good but...........,"This is the first ice cream maker I ever bought. And so far, I have tried to make one batch of ice cream. It took me awhile as trial and error prevailed. I had the same problem with the ice cream not freezing up properly. Maybe I didn't leave the freezer bowl in long enough? After the ice cream was ""done"" around 30 min or so, I put it in the freezer overnight and that seemed to solve the problem. I must admit that this design is much more elegant than others that require ice and salt. Also, if the mixture is not cold to begin with ( I mean near ice cold), the thickest consistency you will get is something like milkshake. Another problem that I had was the fan coming loose at the bottom, thus making loud rasping noises. I fixed that with a screwdriver after I opened up the unit. Overall not a bad buy for the buck I'd say."
2,Not so good.....,We have used this machine several times. Ice cream comes out the consistency of soup.
4,"Looks great, works fine, but is a cheapy, whoo hoo its me","I wanted a good looking ice cream maker for my 9.5 yo son's outlaw lemonade stand (and more...) in front of my store on Sundays. I was hoping to get an $80 machine for 19.99, but what I got was 29.99 machine for 19.99. It looks like a slick Italian job, hence the name ""Villaware"", but it works just like most generic made in China things. I had no problem making soft ice milk (2% milk, hersheys syrup, stevia sweetener) and slightly better choco ic that night (premium choco milk, cream, 2% milk, frozen mixed berrys, stevia sweetener). In 1/2 hr I had a decent dairy treat. I predict the motor will last about 15 uses."
1,What the %$^&,"Nope. This thing don't cut it. Noisy and messy. And too many doggone steps. Freeze this first, freeze that later, keep track of 3-4 parts... and get ingredients that aren't at 7-11. So when you go to 7-11, get the Dryers and use this fancy hi-tech stuff for target practice. I'm no Luddite, by I draw the line at technology takin' over my desserts. Nice try scientists. And come up with a new angle advertising/ marketing (hype) boys. Ain't no need for this one. Ice cream is just plain better the old fashioned way -- from a carton!"
2,"""Film"" being the operative word","these are pretty good, until you wash them. what they are, basically, are pillow cases with saran wrap on the inside. needless to say, they don't hold up well. for people who need to wash the cases often, i don't recommend these."
5,Pillow protector,"I am very satisfied with this product. My husband has it on his pillow and he is very picky and he has not had a bad thing to say about this pillow protector, I asked him if it was noisy due to the water proof covering and he said no. So to me that says it is a great product."
3,Bad zipper.,I would have given it five stars if it weren't for the zipper. I gone through two of theses because the zipper doesn't last.
1,Cheap and Nasty!,"This was my 1st violin and was like playing a block of wood. It wouldn't stay in tune and felt bulky and blocky. It's a terrible thing, but you get what you pay for"
4,"smells great, great customer service too. very tiny bottle though","great, prompt and proper customer service. item arrived in timely fashion. cologne smells amazing. pretty good price for tiffany cologne product, but the bottle is very very tiny. cute little box it came in-it actually did come boxed.it made a nice stocking gift for my boyfriend and I hope he wears some soon and someday buys himself a larger bottle-lol!"
4,Later Life Play,"I performed a scene from this play in my beginning acting class and reading the play helped to put my character into perspective. It was an interesting story line, comical with some mature content. It did not end the way I wanted it to or it ended in a way that suggests there is more to the story. Reading plays in general are a fast way to read a story because it almost all dialog but the reader must rely on their own imagination for what most of the setting looks like. That is a director's job to do, anyhow."
3,Too Many Words!,"While I am sure this book may have some good ideas in it, they would be hard to find. This book is very wordy. I was looking for a book full of integration ideas, this book is full of more justifications of why the arts are important. I know why they are important, what more authors (including this one) need to do is tell us simply and practically how to do it better."
4,"not the best SS, but pretty good","This run should have been called SS guest starring Starlins creations. When Jim Starlin took over he brought a great deal of excitement with him, he also brought the world of Thanos that he created many years ago in Captain Marvel & Iron Man. I am not complaining, i have always been a fan of Thanos, Drax, Mentor & friends. I also enjoyed the addittion of Impossible Man in this collection. Ron Lim is one of the more under rated artist, I wish he would get his own series, maybe the new Nova.The only fault I find in this collection is Starlin tended to minimize the SS in terms of power, he comes on as greatly inferior to Thanos. We all tend to forget his original appearences, the SS represented an Angel of Death ( while Galactus represented God himself ). In defense of starlin most people seem to have forgotten what Kirby meant with the creation of this Iconic Charecter screaming for his own book ( not a mini )"
3,disjointed infinity gauntlet prequel...,"i read this because it was on wizard's top 100 graphic novels list. it's not that good, or comics just lacks quality in depth. the first part is all about the silver surfer (and drax), surfing around looking for thanos. all of a sudden you get dropped into the second part which is all thanos (and no surfer in sight), who goes around rapidly (the battles with the elders should have been greatly expanded in length) collecting infinity gems.without the infinity gauntlet, this is nothing more than a two-part shallow prequel to that series."
2,Dual Action Cleanse - Questionable product?,"Bought the Dual Action Cleanse and hoped to get its promised benefits and results. While it improved bowel movement, I am unsure it really cleansed my colon and lymphatic system. General reviews of this product are not good and some persons mentioned health challenges after taking the product. Personally, I had no health challenge afterward, but was so concerned that I stopped taking it and dumped it in the trash. I did notice that after taking the product, I did not have bowel movements for about 3 days, which is highly unusual for me. Based on my research, the best cleansers to take are Colonix and ToxinOut, which are a bit more expensive."
3,Carla Sciaky,"What a unique and wonderful voice she has!!! I have an ancient cassette of hers, and two songs in particular from that stand out: ""Can I Help It If I'm Not Bouncing Back?"" and ""To Meet You."" Two extraordinary songs that I have loved for many years now, and I was sorry not to find the same sort of songs that connected with me on this CD. She's an exceptional talent - a sweet, clear, almost childlike voice with a haunting presence to it - and the instrumental work is always fine. The songs on this CD simply don't do for me what other works of hers have done; they don't touch me and make me want to hear them again and again. I'll confess, though, that I've listened to the songs on this CD repeatedly only because I enjoy her voice so much. It's the kind of voice that makes you wish you knew the singer."
2,Dog-Fight,"There is a great deal of interesting and valuable information in this book, but it is nearly ruined by extremely poor (or no?) editing. There are numerous, distracting typos as well as sentences that have obviously been rewritten but not had the original wording removed. Chapter subheadings are often followed by text that has little or nothing to do with the supposed subject of the section. Frequently, the author digresses into pages of information not related to the heading or even the title of the chapter! There are also very lengthy quotations from WWI flyer's diaries or action reports that, while interesting as memorabilia, tend to be redundant and add little to the narrative. Many of these sections could have been shortened to better effect. If you want a book about WWI in the air, find a used copy of Reynold's ""They Fought for the Sky"". You'll find it much more fun to read and less aggravating."
1,Watch Out!,Another book from one of the enemy's wolves in sheep's clothing. I would stay away from this author. The book of Jude speaks about this man.
5,Good Stuff Never Grows Old,I had a cassette recording of this years ago and loved it. Looked for it on cd for years without success so I jumped at it when I found it. Great fusion music (rock/jazz). Check out Bassride where the bass guitar plays lead. Highly unusual but extremely well done. Garden of Eden and Blue Tattoo are great albums also. No two albums are alike.
2,Passport's Titanic album,This is the album which sunk future purchases of Passport music for me. The fusion aspect of their music started to go downhill with the album Sky Blue and hit an iceberg with this album. No imagination and amatuerish solos.
1,Limp storyline.,"""Graveyard Girl"" interested me because of the yellow fever plot, and while this book used that as its base, it didn't really get into the history of it. I found the writing to be too choppy and not descriptive enough; I had a very hard time imaging the places. The characters' transition and maturity wasn't realistic, but that could be because we didn't see what they were like before the epidemic. Overall, I found this book to be uncreative. I do not recommend."
5,Devils Knot,"I am a legal secretary, and after reading this book, my whole opion of the law has changed. The amount of absolutely no evidence showing that Damien, Jessie and Jason actually did this makes me sick and I can't believe that the judicial system actually leaves them in jail. I am pulling for each of them, I hope that the real perp gets caught. Shame on the police department and prosecuters involved, you should be ashamed of yourselves. You never even wanted to know who commited the crime, you had your target, and you hit it. How would you feel if it were your kids? Would you let it rest? I would not."
1,Chinese Junk,"I am an experienced medical professional and veteran. I had hoped for a GI M3 Bag as I have always liked the compartments and the ability to store quite a bit of aid equipment in a small package. The bag itself is OK, but it is flimsy in comparison to a real M3 bag. The aid supplies in the bag are largely low quality (generic Chinese manufacture). I am returning the bag and I will assemble my own kit from quality supplies. No point in toting around a bag full of junk."
5,simply the best,don't listen to those people who have no idea what music is all about. This is a great classy concert. If you like chris's music get this.
1,Save your money,This is the worst disc I have ever purchased. I'm not even going to give it away but through this in the trash for I no one I hate enough to give this disc too.
1,what happened to the sound?,"i'm as big a fan of chris' as the next guy, but come on, he obviously didn't listen to this dvd before it was released, as even i'm too embarassed to play this for my friends!i've been waiting forever for a concert of his to play on my home theater system and show him off to my friends. unfortunately, i'm still waiting..."
1,Not Even Entertaining,"Chris DeBurgh should get a marketing manager or at least someone to keep him from embarrassing himself with a product like this one. Half the time, even the audience doesn't know when they are supposed to be excited...except the paid ones.Also, it's great to see a 20 to 30 minute set of acoustic Chris during a concert...but Chris DeBurgh NEEDS a band...without it, his songs go as limp as they do on this DVD.Sorry Chris, I love you, man...but could I have my money back this time?"
3,pages tear out becareful,MAKE SURE YOU CHECK PAGES IN THIS BOOK I WAS RIPPED OFF BECAUSE I DIDNT GO THROUGH THE PAGES..THEY TEAR OUT GO THROUGH THEM BEFORE YOU LEAVE FEEDBACK.
4,Elegant,"This is a quiet album. I hate to use the word ""simple"" because the depth of character and craft is immense. To me, this is one of those albums that is characterized by space, and what the band does with it. As a result, I find myself hanging on notes that come when you least expect them, and when the album is finished you realize you've been in a dream world the entire time. What makes it better is knowing that the end product is exactly what the band wanted to produce, for the love of music."
3,"The Frames ""For the Birds"" review","If you're a huge fan of The Frames you might like this CD. I really like The Frames, but I think For The Birds was an early CD and they don't seem to have developed their unique style. I do love the first song, In The Deep Shade."
3,Uninspired but has some hooks,"My initial impression is that these guys don't have much technical talent. They remind me of a garage band that picked up the instruments after watching someone else play. However, they throw in the usual Pop/Rock/Folk hooks that one would expect from such a group. Overall, my opinion is the title of song number 10. If you're simply looking to add to your music collection, it could be a worthwhile purchase, otherwise, there is better in this genre."
1,Totally boring,"I purchase more cd's than the average person and listen to a wide varitey of music. Because of this, I generally give each new cd 3-5 listens before making or breaking. This one, I couldn't even get through once- it was slow, nothing catchy and ultimatly just boring."
4,This Album will repay your curiosity.,"Having never heard of this band, and buying this album on the back of hearing a snippet of ""lay me down"" (the single from the album) I had reason to be concerned for the [money]I shelled out.Yet this album repayed me in full, and will do the same for all who buy. Swinging from melancholy to cheery folk (Irish folk it seems) the tunes are meticulously created and yet the themes and emotion of the lyrics are not lost in the production. I guess its polished and raw all in one. Curious aren't you.Many of the songs have a relationship-theme base to them, but they are still beautiful, and all unique. ""What Happens when the heart just stops"" and ""disappointed"" are the real heartbreak anthems, while ""early bird"" will catch you immediately, as will the occasionally-played-on-radio ticket ""lay me down"".A mature and praiseworthy effort by a band that (as i only found out recently) has been together for some time. Buy it."
5,Ireland has never sounded so good.,"This Cd is simply amazing. I started on the frames listening to ""Set List"" (live album). There studio work is simply jaw-dropping. Songs like ""What happens when the heart stops"", ""giving me wings"" and ""friends and foe"" are all wonderfull sad pieces. the lyrics on all these songs are also brilliant--its not soppy country style drivel and its not cryptic suicide either. It has a nice poetic sting much like something from a robert frost poem.All in all this is one of the greatest albums ever. dont miss out."
4,A scanner with good operation and size for the price,"A good scanner with very good audio sound. The BC350C is a very good size for a table or desk.It has limit search and every police,fire,air,cb band with plenty of freqency coverage. The Price isalso very good. the scanner doesn't have a keyboard to type in a frequency but, which is ok withme. I like to scan,find, and store freguencies. If you want a keyboard and trunking another scannerwould be a better choice for you, but if you are a beginner , or just want a basic scanner for fun orbasic needs for a decent price this is a very good choice."
4,Excellent Scanner for the Beginner,"Does not support TrunkTracking, however I was unaware of what that was until I read about it in the manual.Scanning larger bands takes time...I don't know if there's a faster scanner.Deleting a saved channel is rather cumbersome, but doable if you're not on the road.Antenna works well with home.Would be nice if I could group my saved channels, but unfortunately, there is only one ""Private"" memory bank for the user."
4,Super basic scanner,"I purchased this scanner to listen solely to the air band in my area. It took about 15 minutes to set up the radio and program in the ten or so frequencies I needed. Reception was good. It was at first a little difficult to delete frequencies--essentially you have to overwrite a frequency you wish to delete--it's not as simple as deleting it. But no biggie, because once I have the frequencies I need in the radio, very little reason to change.I have connected the scanner to a very simple AM/FM roof antenna, and now can hear jets 40-50 miles away as they pass through 24000 feet. So this scanner is excellent for what I need--just to pull in a few channels. It has no luxury functions, is just a robust, plain vanilla scanner."
5,preformed as expected,I am pleasantly surprised with my 350 c scanner. In fact after I programmed it I ordered another. Just follow the directions.
4,Listen,"Great little scanner. The biggest drawback is it does not have a numberical entry keypad so an existing frequency must be selected then you scroll up or down to the desired frequency (it can then be saved). Since I like to enter my frequencies in ascending order this works fairly well, albeit a little slow.I also like the preset bands. This allows exploration as well as instant use when in a new area.Sitting by the scanner monitoring the preset bands is a good way to discover local freqs and enter them into my own band."
4,"Good sound quality, not to easy to use.","Sound is better than radio at times, not to easy to locate nearby frequencies in use."
2,Police Scanner,"This product did not meet my expectations. In the description of the product it did not explain that it would not work on every police frequency available. It does not pick up any digital trunking frequencies, which is what my local police, fire, and other emergency services uses. It was totally useless to me except to get a local weather band."
4,Learning about The Leadership Spectrum,"Mary Lippitt's book provides a new model for understanding the successes and failure points in leadership performance. It focuses on the way leaders achieve results, but also gives insights into how different values and mindsets influence opportunities to lead within each phase of an organization's lifecycle. The book provides both a theoretical model and practical guidelines on ways to improve leadership and outcomes. I recommend it to students of organizations, people who want to enhance their leadership capabilities, and consultants."
4,Total information about the motor control,"I recommend that this book is useful to understand and teachthe patient with the central nervous system lesion and studyto physiotherapist ""What's the motor contol?"""
4,vegetable book review,"If you are a gardener and you really like to grow vegetables, this is the book for you. It has a tremendous amount of vegetable information in it. BUY IT and You'll love it."
1,Book is not what one is looking for,This book's instruction on massage is short and lacking. The pictures are unhelpful and harsh rather than attractive and instructive. If one understands what the book is refering to and one knows how to administer a stroke the book is useful for basic knowledge. This is not a manual. Please continue looking
1,Not recommend this product,"I bought this product from Amazon almost one month ago for our remote office in North Carolina - it didn't work well there. Then I asked our remote office to have shipped it to our headquarter office in California. I tested it today in our main office. Among 8 servers (2 Win NT 4.0 and 6 Win 2K Servers), it only works with 2 Win 2K servers, but not with other 4 win 2k and 2 Win NT servers. I spent 1.5 hours to try different cables, keyboards, mise and monitors. But it simply doesn't work!!! I felt very frustrated!If possible, I will definitely return this product to Amazon next week. I don't recommend this product."
1,Image quality and functionality,"I recently purchased one of these units to replace my 4 port KVM.I get serious shadowing on resolutions ranging from 1280x1024 to 1600x1200, regardless of refresh rate and type of monitor. With external power connected, it will cease to switch if a random system on it is turned off until that system is powered up.Aside from functionality, the beep on switch which cannot be disabled is annoying. I regret waiting until I had found and purchased higher quality cables to make sure they weren't the problem with the display as I was unable to return it."

4,Good,"A good book. Some of the tricks are common sense, but some of the tricks are really good. I enjoyed the author's comedy and would recommend this book to anyone in need of bettering their relationship.Finished this book in approximately 2 days."
3,"Cute, but mostly cheap","Most of this information you've probably seen before if you've read anything similar. Bear in mind that the title tells all: cheap tricks. There is no overarching theme to the book, just a random collection of facts, albeit interesting ones. It won't take you long to read and it won't be something that you'll ever use as a reference to return to. Still, it is what it is and it does a fair job at that."
2,Yuck!,"I bought this book based on ratings because I needed a book to help me classify animals into their correct group. This book is so boring and very confusing. The pictures of the organisims are nice but the way the book is presented in plain english ""sucks""."
5,fascinating!,Terrific book. I enjoy it immensely. Nice combo of great intellectual material and nice pictures :) One of my favorites in this area of science.
4,Victorian details,"This book details life for an upper middle class family in London about 1880. If your interest is in American life of the period, some of the details will be different, but the book is still very useful, and the illustrations, most of them photographs, are excellent. Some good information on the technology of housekeeping. Interestingly, the ""Places to Visit"" listed at the back are all in the U.S."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING DO NOT PURCHASE OR RENT THIS ONE,"The title and description seems to promise nude models. Well let me tell you that there are none in this video. Or at least you cannot see anything as they have black censor bars over all exposed ""parts"" And to make matters worse, they used still photos of the ""nude models"" Very disappointing."
1,Highly disappointing!,"With 'Nude' in title , the redacting was uncalled for. I was cheated! I will not use this venue again."
2,nude girls exposed,all they did is talk probably won't rent another one of these. really didn't watch whole thing just skipped through it
1,there was no nudity!!!!!!!!!!,there was no nudity. I feel like I was lied to and cheated. horrible. I was extremely disapointed!!!!!! do not rent or buy!!!!!!!!!!
4,Not to bad!,"Ive had this one for 2 years. It was cheap and its was all i found at the time, soo i got it. Its now 2 years later and its still going. It only has 4 blades unlike most who have 6-8, sooo it chops more then minces. I get nice cubbed chicken for pot pies or nice pieces of garlic, i drop it in the dishwasher and it hasnt rusted either! Only after 2 years with lots of use am in the marker for a new one, but only because my blades are getting a little dull and i have no clue of they can be sharpened. BUT over all it was a great little product for the $!"
1,cheap chopper,I had a chopper like this one years ago and it worked quite well. Over the years I lost it and wanted to replace it. This chopper looked exactly like the one I lost. Except that it was made with much poorer and thinner materials. This chopper is priced low but is not worth it. I couldn't get it apart to clean. The chopping was passable but the plastic is very thin and if you can't take it apart to clean it is not usable. I threw it away.I have since bought the Slap Chop and am happy with it. The construction is good and easy to clean. And chops very well.
2,Cheap Plastic!,"I was disappointed at how thin and cheap the plastic parts are. It's hard to get the lid screwed on right, and forget about dismantling the lid/blade combo for cleaning. I took the lid apart only one time, and it took me forever to re-seat the blade assembly back into the lid.I don't expect this chopper to last more than a few months without the plastic cracking. At least the blades are very sharp, so for as long as it lasts, it'll chop nicely.Silly me for not remembering that YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! If you buy cheap, you get cheap."
2,Feedback,"I bought a 2013 Honda Accord sport. Yesterday I went to a music store and put a 10"" Bazooka (with integrated amp) and also 4 new pioneer speakers. The technician warns me that these cars usually had a ""feedback"" problem and I cannot install a bazooka or amp to my Accord. I wanted to try anyways and in effect once they had finished with the installation and I close the driver's door the feedback start.Is there anything that can help me to fix this problem?Thanks!"
2,Buyer Beware,"You are probably better off buying the universal fast harness from Bazooka than this. It plugged right into my 2007 Honda Pilot adapter fine, but this item did not plug into the actual stereo unit ok. Had to shave off the plastic in a small ""valley"" shape in the middle of the adapter to force fit it into the stereo unit. Then had to gently hammer it down into the unit to get it to fit snug. It works, but it would be easier simply to use the Model #: FAST-9999 Universal Harness purchased directly from the Bazooka website and NOT Amazon."
3,READ BEFORE BUYING!,This is an excellent product! It is actually smaller than shown in picture and is not actually made by Dampit. The product is a knock-off but an excellent one! Worth the money!
4,Koss Headphones - Good For It's Purpose,"For an ""over the ear"" headphone set, this is a good choice. Great sound and it stays on you when you're exercising. The only drawback is that the metal over-the-head band is a little awkward and takes a while to get use to using - but it does hold well. Otherwise, it's great (albeit not as cool as earbuds)."
4,best bang for your buck,"if you're considering buying this headphone, don't hesitate. it's worth your money. i use it for my ipod and my computer. i never thought headphone this price will sound this good. my only dislike is the looks."
3,Great Sound and Portability,"I bought these headphones after reading the many great reviews online. They do sound incredible, but maybe lacking a little bass for my style. The design is extremely comfortable and portable. (I can't stand wearing ear buds!) I wish Koss had included a volume switch on the cord, but I have yet to find my dream headphones that include this feature. My main problem with this product is noise cancellation. After viewing the product pic, I mistakenly thought the phones cupped your ears. But instead, they are the old fashioned style. I don't believe they are worth the money for this reason. I live in NYC, and at their highest volume level, they don't block the noise of busses and trains."
1,Stop working in two months,"I have only had these heaphones for two months and one side has already stop working. Do not buy these. I'm not a heavy user, they get used maybe twice a week on the weekends."
4,"Great sound, weak cord","I agree with all the positive reviews about these amazing stereophones. They sound phenomenal for the price. The only negative is the weakness of the cords. After a year or two of normal use, one side or the other may break its connection and there's no way you can fix it yourself (many tiny strands to solder). I have returned mine twice to Koss (great lifetime warranty) and they have replaced them for a small $6 shipping charge. It takes about 3-4 weeks. That's my only complaint."
4,Work great...,"These headphones work great. I use them with my Ipod touch and my laptop. They are light, extremely comfortable and have excellant sound. Tough to beat for the cost, and the Koss warrenty is the best. Highly recommend."
5,Awesome Headphones!!!,I love these headphones! I hardly know I have them on; that's how comfortable they are. The sound is phenomenal. I recommend them highly for budget-minded people who are particular about how their music sounds!!
4,Koss PortaPro's simply rock!,"I have tried at least 5 different headphones from the earbud type to the every rear mounted type. These phones have an outstanding high output volume if desired. The quality of sound reproduction is the best that I have heard in the portable class. I have some good full coverage phones and they have superior bass but that is to be expected. The first thing that people remark about while listening to them, is the realistic and profound BASS. The only thing that may be a problem is that the pads tend to cause you to sweat under extreme or hot weather exercise. With the realization that no set of headphones are ideal under all conditions I feel the vast majority of people that hear these phones will want them for their own. I have literally sold a half a dozen just by letting people listen to mine. The lifetime warranty is a bonus!"
5,great sound,"I agree with those who say the look is retro, but I have to say the sound is fantastic, especially for $30.! I compared it to my full size Sennheiser which cost considerably more and the sound was great. When playing various styles of music you'll find it does sound better on pop/rock/country music compared to classical music, but it was no slouch on the classical side. It really brought my laptop to life, whether it was music or a movie. I would suggest you carefully put it on to avoid pulling on your hair, but that wasn't too diffucult. My son tried it and he wanted to trade the Sony's I gave him, I told him he was out of luck!"
5,"For the money, A1","For the money spent, these are some of the best headphones I've ever owned. In fact, it's the fourth pair I've owned. The other three were stepped on, sat on or in one case, lost. Much better than the earbuds Apple provides with an iPod. The sound is rich and clear with audible low ends that are very nice."
5,.....superbly SOUND DEVISE .......,...... is gonna be a WHOLE year since I purchase this excellent ..... COMFORTABLE / LIGHT / GOOD SOUND ..... headphones .... I carry them with no discomfort .... I even PURCHASED beats .... and did not got used to them .... sold them ( very cheap U$ 150 ) ..... I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS ...... love them .... THANKS koss .
4,Great sound but they don't last.,"These are the best headphones you can get for the price. They have rich bass and are extremely comfortable on my head. Heck, I even took them jogging with me and had no problems at all. The only downside to these headphones is they are built cheaply and break. After one month of using them vigorously (I mean every single day jogging and walking all over the place) the wire inside the cable broke loose. No worries though. All I need to do is send them back to Koss and they will fix them (they have a lifetime Warranty). You only have to pay shipping."
2,prefer Sportapro,I bought these headphones thinking I was moving up slightly from my Koss Sportapros. Wrong! They are a half step down in sound quality. Specs say they should be at least as good but in reality they have a 'tinnier' sound.
3,Sounds great but uncomforatble,"The Headphone sounds great and Looks awesome. but i did feel it was not comfortable to wear long time. one biggest problem is you cannot set the head adjustment. it will be collapsed every time you take it out from your head and again needs reset when you wear it again,that's a big pain. also the firm/light setting also repeated task you got to do every time.. really want to keep myself but get irritated adjusting every time..Looking for something not annoying me and sounds great.going back to amazon after 3 hrs trial.."
3,Great sound but hard to get the fit adjusted right,"For a, dare I say, cheap pair of headphones, the sound is great. My biggest complaint is adjusting the fit is tedious. The ""Comfort Zone"" switch always pops back to the tightest setting unless you first get the headphones situated and then carefully slide the switch while being careful not to bump the pivot point and pop the switch back to firm. Also, the adjustable headband fights against it's own springiness and it's hard to make it hold at anything other than wide open or completely closed. Finally, if you slide the headband adjustment while the headphones are on your head, you will almost inevitably pull hair into them. If you don't plan on folding them up much for transportation, I would recommend looking at a different pair."
3,"great bass, great price, poor craftsmanship","This pair of folding headphones has a lot going for it. They clamp to your head firmly without being uncomfortable. The pads move around to compensate for different shaped heads and ears, which is nice. They fold up into a little circle for easy storage, though the pouch they supply in which to store them is a *little* small for ease of storage.But onto the sound - highs are great, without tinniness, bass response is good without distortion. They're no Bose cans - but at this price, they're an AMAZING deal.EDIT** - Be VERY careful with these - they are not rigidly constructed, and will break in half at the drop of a hat. If you're looking for a pair of headphones to drop in your bag and go, don't pick these. These will sit on your counter or shelf and as long as you don't fling them about, will remain intact. But the fact that they're designed as ""portable"" is very misleading. They WILL break."
2,"Fine sound quality, but not comfortable.","I got these because the low price, good sound quality and they are collapsable.They do all those, they were a good price and good sound but man these are very uncomfortable. They pinch at the eyes and my hair would be caught in them all the time. I stopped using them all together and now they just collect dust."
1,Absolute crap,After two days the headphones just fell appart. Very flimsy and not that comfortable. There are much better over the ear headphones you could buy.
4,Sound is better than much more expensive headphones I've tried,"The sound is unbeatable at virtually any price point. My only criticism, and the reason I gave the PortaPros 4 stars instead of 5, is that the cable and jack are very fragile. One wrong tug or bend and you can lose the sound in one earpiece or the other. As a result, I've had to replace these headphones several times."
2,My Portapro Problems,I had a 2 portapro that have the same identical problem. Both had one side of the speaker failed on me. I have to wiggle the wire to get the sound back but after awhile that fails too. I really like the sound while it was working properly but dislike the old head band design.
5,Truely Fine Sound,"If you want truely remarkable sound quality (on par with $100 Senns), and possibly the best value in listening technology, add the Portapros to you shopping basket. The geek chic stylings are coupled with a delicate build. Give them the treatment they deserve (i.e. not at the bottom of a backpack full of books), and the Portapros will perform VERY well.Be warned that once you get these headphones, you will spend alot of time rediscovering old music. I have gone through all of my favorite and most listened-to CDs, and have found details I never knew existed in all of them."
1,cushion broke within wearing it twice,"Not a reliable product, ear cushion just fell off, wow, poor product. I had heard sound was nice, and it was for a short moment"
3,Good with one major let down,Got the head phone in a timely fashion and really liked them. Very comfortable with cool and unique styling. The only thing that really upset me about them was about after only a month of regular use the head phone jack where the wire meets the jack has begun to get really touching while listening. Only delivering sounds from one ear at time. I hear there's a life time warranty so lets hope Koss stay true to there word
3,You get what you pay for.,"If you're not looking to spend too much, then don't be surprised by the quality. It's a good workhorse for commutes and stuff but don't expect it to do a superb job. As far as inexpensive headphones, this pair is okay."
4,SURPRISED!,"I just received the Koss PortaPro headphones, and was a bit skeptical at how fragile and small they were. But the sound quality is amazing for the price. It comes with its own little pouch, but its a bit small and you'll have to cram the headphones in there, which you don't want to do considering their a bit on the fragile side. Overall very pleased, but make sure you take good care of them!"
5,koss porta pro,these r the best headphones for the money. They are retro looking but all i care about is sound... and they sound nice...
3,Sound good but feels like wearing a vise-grip on my head,"I remember having these headphone almost 20 years ago, loved them. They sound great, deep-rich bass and fantastic highs. But now it seems that I am wearing vise-grips on my heads. I am thinking I should have bought the Koss KSC35 ear clip headphones which uses the same drivers as these."
3,Just ok,"Interesting design, travel well, sound is very very good, but they are not really comfortable to wear nor do they look good. My daughter laughed when she saw them on my head."
3,"decent sound, very fragile.",I broke my first set of these after 2 weeks. I did like the sound enough to order another but now that I'm used to it I find the whole experience a little light. I don't get a real sense of immersion in the music anymore and noisy music tends to sound muddled and bad on these things.Bass is great though.These things are incredibly flimsy. The speakers hang on to the headband by a piece of plastic around half the size of a tic tac. If you're going to be putting them into a loaded bag there's a good chance they'll come back out broken and impossible to repair.
4,Koss PortaPro Headphone with Case,"Recived in good wirking cindition. Vendor could improve on delivery as it took 3 weeks to arrive. Nevertheless, it was a good buy from them and the product was more than I had expected (both build & siund quality). You can't go wrong with this headphone, like the rest who had reviewed this before, just enjoy it with any genre of music. Very satisfied with the overall experience. Would have given a 5 star if not for the long delivery."
1,Dead on Arrival,"Plugged it in and no sound.One of the speaker's ON lights not lit.I have idea how it sounds, sending it back.Unless you have time on your hands and enjoy hassles, try something else."
3,Weak Construction,"They give a good sound for the price, but bass distorts when driven with rock at louder volumes.The headband is flimsy due to it's portability. No good for workouts as the membrane absorbs sweat and is very easy to tear.The wear and tear factor is of important not due to the cheapo materials around the cans. Of less important note is also their dated 80's appearance."
3,Koss PortaPro Headphones with Case,"I was look for an inexpensive, lightweight set of headphones with decent sound. They provided this, but were a bit uncomfortable behind the ear, and lost their tightness around the head in a short time.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00001P4ZH/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
5,Just perfect...,"I have nothing bad to say about these headphones - simply excellent, true bass..perfect sound - what more do you want from your headphones? :)"
2,"OK, but pressuring ears/skull","The earphones are fine, but they create too much pressure physically on the skull (ears). They don't just sit, they squeeze onto your ears. Definitely a minus for me. Maybe I'll get used to them, but so far I feel it was a bad call."
2,fragile,"Well I read the reviews where people said they broke and thought they must have been a bit rough with them, wrong. I hardly touched them and one side fell off, I pushed it back together but then 2 weeks later the other side broke off. What a disappointment"
5,Clear sounding and very comfortable to wear,I bought this from Amazon specifically for my twenty hour airline journey. Most of my music I hear is lossless format on IPOD (converted from CD using EAC software). I am a guitarist and musician and use various studio monitors and get very easily disappointed by bad quality. I am very impressed by the tightness of the sound coming out of the headphones. The bass is well defined.The headphones are very comfortable to wear and for a guy with a shaven head thats an important criteria as well :-)I will definitely recommend these headphones to friends.Lastly the price just blew me away ! Koss could have charged much higher than this but someone out there is a Music Jedi :-) May the force be with Koss.
4,"4.5, actually. These are the ones...","After 15 years with my pair, I finally blew out the diaphragms. Bought 2 pair of high-end Bose headphones. Was quite disappointed.Like others have said, these units have changed little since the mid 80's but have fanastic range, thump and boom. Light weight comfortable and affordable. Highly responsive coils and foldable design.Highly highly recommended as (in my opinion) being the best portable, non-noise cancelling phones on the market.Will make your mp3 player, walkman or discman much more robust sounding and gives very little ear fatigue,'cept after 4 or more hours of use.Getting another pair ASAP!"
4,Great sound quality,"The Koss Portapro headphones have a great sound quality and are very comfortable. That said, the headphones are smaller than what they look in the pictures and the design is pretty good, when you fold them they become manageable. The construction doesn't look very durable but there is the life time guarantee."
5,"I was very skeptical, but the sound won me over","I decided to seek these headphones out after reading that it was a CNET editor's choice for headphones. The price was more than reasonable, but I was still wondering if headphones that look like they fell out of some sort of 1980s time warp would really impress me. When I got the box, they were even uglier than the pictures and I was tempted to not even bother opening them. But I did, and I was blown away by the sound quality. Earbuds get on my nerves after a while, so I really wanted to find some comfortable headphones. These are surprisingly very comfortable and easy to adjust. I can't wait to hear all of my music all over again with the amazing sound quality."
5,Great amplified sound for cost,"These headphones are great for those who want to upgrade their listening experience from earbuds or standard headphones. Small, compact, padded, and adjustable, they amplify sound on their own, with a standard jack and no need for another power source. Just plug them right in to your laptop and what was coming out mediocre will pump out strong with adequate bass amplification as well. For the price, its a great upgrade to listening on the laptop, especially. Really brings out the sound. Not very happy about how they feel on my head. I have a shaved head and the metal band with plastic pieces isnt very comfortable, but I imagine if you have hair that wont be a problem. Also, one of the plastic adjustment clips broke off, but a little piece of tape fixed it so I can keep using it. Ive had them six months now. Cant complain. Passing a new set on to my brother for xmas."
5,Sounds Great!,"I have owned many headphones, some very bad and some very expensive. These headphones are extremely cheap in price but are very well made. They are very comfortable and light, but they feel very sturdy and durable unlike a lot of the plastic ones. The most impressive thing though is the quality of the audio. I love the sound quality. I also own the Bose on-ear headphones which cost 5x more and personally I like the sound of the portapro headphones better. Although they don't keep in or keep out the sound very well."
5,Great as an upgrade to the iPod earphones!,"I ordered these after I read all the good reviews about them. I'm not an audiophile, so I don't really understand much about the lows and highs and such, but I got these to replace the headphones that came with my iPod Touch. These sound crystal clear and are incredibly comfortable. The only flaw is that the settings reset every time you take them off. I listen to many types of music, mainly alternative rock, folk rock, and instrumental tracks. I read about them pulling your hair out, but I don't experience that at all, and my hair is below my shoulders. A great buy, get them!"
5,Portability and Good Sound at a Great Price,"I can't really add much to the other glowing reviews here about the Koss PortaPro headphones. They are very compact and portable, yet deliver amazingly good sound (with really deep bass!), especially for the low price! The only negative I can think of is that they are a bit hard to put on over your head because of their small size, but the solution to that is to buy a pair of full-size headphones - at a MUCH higher price if you want equivalent sound quality!"
5,Excellent headphones,"I have been using these for about a month now. I have done some traveling, working out, and simple listening at work with the Porta Pros and I love them so far. The bass is great, the sound quality is wonderful for a tiny portable set of headphones, and they are comfortable on my ears.I would definitely buy another pair."
3,"Good headphones, but very fragile","I got them a week ago.The Good:The sound is very good - better than some more expensive ones that I had.They are very comfortable on the head and accurate with the sounds.They are Iphone1 compatible, which for me is a blessing.They have a lifetime warrantyThe bad:They come with a small leather like case, which is very hard to put them into it. One time when I stuck it into the case, they seemed to break, but I could reconnect it (the part of the archer fell and needed to be reconnected, and on the worst case I could send them for fix because they have a lifetime gwarranty...)I reccomend to purchase the plastic carring case for them.The"
2,Koss fooled me twice.....,"......so shame on me!! All that's left to do is warn you not to make the same mistake. The description above states a lifetime warranty for these headphones--I wonder how that works? And does anyone register $30 headphones for the warranty to work? Who knows where my original paperwork is. I know--shame on me again!I've owned the fantastic-sounding Koss Porta-Pros twice, and after enjoying them for about 9 months, the wire coating on them started to fray. No amount of duct tape rigging will prevent the deterioration of the flimsy material. Nor can you prevent the eventual crackling, then loss of sound in one ear. Can't Koss put an extra $5 on the price to house the wires in better material??"
2,sounds like 2.99 earbuds,"After reading other reviews, I was really looking forward to getting these headphones. The design is ok and the portability good, but the sound quality was no better than the $10 cheapo headphones I had been using. Don't get me wrong...for the price, I wasn't expecting Bose. But I did expect some decent sound. You can't play certain songs because the bass makes the speakers rattle really loudly. And I don't mean hip-hop or rap base...ANY base, country, pop or whatever. When I first heard it, I thought the sound was coming from somewhere in my room. If I had to do it over again, I would invest another $20 bucks and get something better. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the design...but that's useless if the sound sucks."
2,Headphones do not include Case!,"I ordered the Koss PortaPro Headphones directly from Amazon, but found out it does not include a Case even though the description indicates it does."
2,just.... no.,these headphones arrived a day late.these headphones have only OK sound quality for the price.but they are just so easy to break...day 25 of having them a wire pulled loose... it was only held in by school glue.when you think about getting these headphones... just... no.
2,Too much bass,"The PortaPro's have way too much bass in them. If you like that in your listening, great. They handle it very well. But they're hardly transparent. I'm sorry I bought them."
4,NICE SOUND,Great product - Great sound. They travel nice in my backpack. It comes with a soft case so I bought an extra hardshell case for protection.
4,Excellent value for price,I'm not an experienced expert but to me the sound quality of these $30 phones is more than equal to almost all of the many sets I've actually sampled in the $75-$150 range.I've used the Koss PortoPros particularly to study Mahler's early symphonies - an exacting test of the sound range and brightness of any headphone.My only gripe is not with the phones themselves but with Amazon's extraordinary export policy. They could export the phones to Australia but not the accompanying volume control as featured in conjunction with the phones. It's still a mystery.
4,Fantastic headphone for the price!!!!!,"Who knew you could get an excellent pair of headphones for under $40? ... I had my doubts, but once I listened to my first track of music on them, I knew I had gotten a fantastic deal. I'm no audiophile by any means, and I'm sure you can get a better pair of headphones, but at what price? $150? $200? $300? .... These are $40 ... let me repeat that .. $40!!! If you just want a good pair of headphones and don't want to spend hours looking for one, searching for review, etc.. just buy these excellent sounding headphones. Sure, they're sort of weird in design, but they're very comfortable and I can listen for hours and not feel any discomfort. And did I mention they're under $40? ..."
5,Excellent Sound,Excellent sound for such a small over the ears headphone. They deliver a rich bass but not overwhelming and overall a very good balance of frequencies. I bought these as a replacement for another pair (same exact model) which I dropped and ruined the hinge on one side. I recommend a period of few hours of functioning before you'll get the maximum refinamnet out of them - just let them play alone for a day (as I did).
4,Best bang for your buck,"These are top tier headphones, especially for the price. I decided to upgrade my sound quality, but at the same time I'm reluctant to make a major investment due to my propensity to break/lose things. Boy was I lucky to find these on CNET. Sound is outstanding. There are two drawbacks that prevent me from giving them a five star. One is that there is major sound leakage from the headset. Don't plan on using these anywhere above very quiet without people hearing it. The second is that there is an occasional crackling sound emitted by the headphones, which is particularly noticeable during quiet parts in songs. Overall an excellent headphone set and a must buy."
5,Koss Rocks!,"I love these headphones! The sound quality is great for such a low priced set. I don't know all the technical terms, but the tones are very clear. Bass is nice and bass-y, treble doesn't screech on high notes. I ride the train to and from work everyday and I don't have to turn them up very loud to cover the train/people sounds, which is very nice.The best part for me, however, is their size. I also have a small head for an adult (seriously, I buy kids hats sometimes) and a lot of headphones just slide off, even the pricey Bose ones. These stay on and can even be adjusted to how you firm would like the headphones to be on your ears. And if that's not enough, they fold up nice a small and I can slip them into my purse with no issue."
5,Better than buds!,"The earbuds that came with my XMp3 were my first experience with inner ear phones and it was not a good one. Constantly having to shove them back in, cleaning the wax out of them and the worst thing was it was impossible to wear them while eating. Chewing works them out of the ear! In spite of that I put up with them for years, but was happy when one speaker went out so I had an excuse to replace themI read all the reviews and these seemed to be the best value and though they look a bit fragile the sound is excellent. They are comfortable, and everyone who sees them are impressed with the sound and the compact folding. It's only been a few days but I am very happy with this purchase."
5,Best quality sound for the money,Koss Portal Pro offers excellent sound quality. They are comfortable and can be worn a long time. I like the retro style looks from the Eighties. Bottom line is that they are the best value for the money. I am ordering another pair just in case something happens so I will always have a back up set.
4,Excellent sound,Great sound even the low spectrum. Fits good. Does have a little bit of a throwback style but makes up for that is sound quality.
2,"Fantastic drivers, obviously, but they don't make them like they used to","I bought these headphones obviously because of the glowing reviews that are literally everywhere about them. When I received them I was absolutely astonished at how cheaply they are put together, and was very disappointed. The cable is so thin and flimsy it literally creases from gravity. The metal feels like strips of aluminum from a can of soda. That being said, I was FLOORED by the audio quality. Make no mistake, the two months it takes you to break these, you will be gushing over the crisp balance and the deep, rich bass. My left ear blew out, and instead of taking advantage of the warranty, I chucked this one up as a loss and found the Sennheiser HD 202's to be exactly what I was looking for at this price. I would suggest you check those out instead if you are in the market for this caliber of sound for the sub-$30 dollar price point (and who isn't, really)."
5,portapro is a pro!,I checked out a lot of portable headphones and the KOSS PORTAPRO was definitely the BEST BANG for YOUR buck! AND a LIFETIME guarantee to boot.
4,Good headphones,"These are good headphones, crisp sound, but don't expect the kind of sound you'd get with a pair of Sennheiser HD280, for example. I wanted good sound with great comfort and that's what I got."
5,Koss PortaPro headphones,"Great little lightweight portable compact folding headphones. Perfect for what I bought them for, working out at the gym, walking etc. Would recommend them for that purpose. Good value for the price."
5,Great,These headphones are a bit to good. If you listen to low quality MP3s you will be disappointed since these pick up all the little clicks due to poor MP3 compression. The high end is a little harsh at times but that is mostly due to poor mixing. Overall PortaPros are great for higher quality audio and they fold up nice for portability.
4,Highly acclaimed,"Pro's-Excellent sound quality-Reasonably durableCon's-Fit-StyleLet me explain a little about the cons, Very ugly headphones provided with some temple dampening system that does absolutely nothing. The metal band comes in a very unnatural round bend that make the temple pads barely touch my cranium so they leave me wondering who's oblong head might this design fit perfectly? I have been pondering bending the metal to fit me more properly but I really don't like the idea. The headphones metal bands will pull your hairs and also note if you like loud bass you might want to look elsewhere. There might be a better headset for your portable music needs but I have yet to find something above the sound quality of my porta pros"
4,Koss Portapro headphone review,Excellent audio quality in the product and really like it. Could have been cheaper :-)
5,All the reviews on Amazon and Cnet were right!,"After compensating spending a hundred dollars for the Sennheiser HD 555's I'm really thrilled with my choice. These headphones are incredibly comfortable and i love how compact they are. they seem very durable, as I constantly throw them in the outer pocket of my backpack when I tote it around. Plus, the sound quality is awesome for these headphones. If you've read other reviews the sound does leak some, but unless you're planning on deafening your ears, you should be fine. My only complaint was the travel case that the headphones came in. It was a nice leather pouch with a drawstring that seems like it will hold up, but the problem is that the pouch is slightly too small, where it's a hassle to get them in and out of the pouch. I don't bother with it. Overall, I would recommend these headphones to anyone who loves getting great value at a lesser price."
4,Classic portable headphone,I purchased my first set in the 1980s in Australia at twice the cost in the USA & they are still my favourite headphones. You are so lucky in the USA to be able to buy these at a very good price with life time warranty.I am now on my second pair.Amazon & Koss will not send these to Australia so i miss out on the amazingly low price. The sound quality for portable use is the best of all my headphones.They are fragile & i suggest you treat them gently . I use mine only when i have am travelling in noisy enviroments as they bleed sound . Their sound output from my walkman is much higher than from my other of my headphones.
3,"Great sound quality, however, not durable.","The Koss PortaPro headphone set sounds incredibly good for the money. But, just like the review title says, they are not that durable. I used mine about an hour a day for six and a half weeks until the right ear started farting out. For the price, I might try another pair, but I wouldn't hesitate to try something else either."
2,"Great portability, shoddy build.","I loved my PortaPros at first and used them often for the two months they lasted, but after that the plastic connector between one of the earphones and the band broke off, rendering the whole thing useless. As a college student, I need a bit more durability from my headphones... I'm disappointed, since I thought they were so great at first."
4,Good Item,"The product is solid, nothing to make you cry if lost, stolen or broken. Just glad I didn't have to ship back for refund."
2,not great,"i bought these over a year ago hoping that a company offering a lifetime warranty would provide a product that would last; i'm on my third pair. when they work, they are ok, but every 6 months the sound quality becomes so painfully bad i send them back. i suggest throwing your money elsewhere."
3,"Good, but not a search-ender","I happened upon the review for these PortaPros on CNET's Web site from a few years back and was very interested. I really wanted these headphones to be the end of my search. Unfortunately, they were not. While the sound quality was good, it wasn't much different from the earbuds and noise-cancelling headphones I currently use. The comfort of these on-ear headphones was quite good, but they didn't blow me away.Pros:Comfortable on the ears (did not pull my hair)Compact and easily portableCons:Sound quality was not memorable"
2,going on my 3rd pair.....,"the headphones are great, however a few issues that i had..... 1st pair, left speaker phone in-operative after 3 weeks use, 2nd pair, left speaker in-operative after 4 weeks of normal use. only other comment (not complaint) the comfort zone adjustment defaults automatically to firm, and will not stay on the light adjustment. great speakers, poor design and manufacturing. companies like koss, do not like constructive, input, but I'll give them another try. after all, i live in Moog-ville, NC ,aka Bob Moog(god bless, r.i.p.) aka asheville, NC, former home to bob moog and current home to the moog museum and moog-fest and of course...asheville, nc ...music capital of the carolinas. peace. love and joy.... btw, Amazon has been wonderful to deal with regarding my returns and replacements, that's why i continually shop Amazon, not walsmart or k-art or targot or bust buy. Shop Amazon!"
4,Good Headphone Value,"I've had these for a week. I like them a lot.The Good- Great clean sound across the spectrum for all kinds of music.- Very comfortable- Great value- Lifetime warrantyThe Not So Good- Flimsy. They are very light.- If you aren't careful, your hair can get caught in the adjustment band.- The adjustment band doesn't hold it's position. When you remove the phones, the band springs back to a default position. One poster suggested taping them into a position that fits- The Comfort Zone switch for Firm and Light doesn't lock, but it doesn't make much difference anyway. These headphones are very comfortable.- Minimal noise isolationWhen I bought these, I also bought a pair of Skullcandy Ink'd. The Skullcandy phones do a better job isolating noise, but the Portapros sound a lot better. If you are looking for great sounding, light, comfortable headphones, you can't do much better than the Koss Portapro."
5,Skeptical at first but totally sold now!,"I have never written a review before but I feel compelled to with this product. I thought these headphones looked stupid and cheap, but after trying other headphones (Sony, Monster, etc.), and reading all the reviews, I thought I'd give them a try. The good reviews are no joke! How something that looks so cheap can be so good is beyond me. The sound quality is great, they are durable (and have a limited lifetime warranty), and they are pretty comfortable. Seriously, I was pleasantly surprised. Worth every penny."
4,I found great sound now that I'm using them,"I bought these along with a similarly priced set of Sennheiser headphones about 9 months ago. Not until I recently purchased a Zen Micro did I decide to test all my headphones on this MP3 player. Needless to say, other than the Bose QC2 set, which is essentially in a league of its own, the Koss beat out every other set I own. This includes both Denon and Sony closed systems.I guess the style and seemingly awkward design made me initially think these headphones were a bad purchase. So, they were relegated to the bookshelf until the Zen player arrived. I have to say that the goofy looking design is just that. However, the sound quality (clarity, separation, tonal balance, etc.) is exceptional for an open ear system. Nearly every bit as good as the Bose except that the ambient noise distracts from the experience at times."
3,Koss PortaPro Headphones not as comfortable as expected,"I purchased the Koss PortaPro Headphones and the Sennheiser PX 100 Headphones at the same time 09/04/06. The Koss PortaPro Headphones were not as comfortable as expected based on what I had read prior to purchase.After about 15 minutes I wanted to take them off. The sound quality was excellent however. But what good is that if they are not comfortable [to me]. The Sennheiser PX 100 Headphones were just the opposite of the Koss! They were very comfortable - hours on end. Sound quality was very good, but a cut below the Koss. Bottom line - for an expected short listening sesson where I want the best sound - I use the Koss. Otherwise it's the Sennheiser most of the time."
5,The best,"I just had to chime in when I saw another reviewer saying the Sportapros were as good as the Portapros for sound. My experience was that there was a significant difference in sound quality between the two. I WANTED the Sportapros to sound great, but they didn't. I went back to the Portapros, which I've used for 20 plus years. They in fact are very rugged, as I use them running all the time, and jam them into my suitcase. If there's ever a problem, the lifetime warranty covers that! (I think you send Koss $6.00 for S&H). I do something a little weird, though, and that's make them LOOK like Sportapros by spraypainting them flat black and putting some black tennis grip tape on the shiny aluminum headband (this sets the adjustable head sizing band specifically for my size, too). Just some ideas!"
1,Displeased,"I first bought these headphones over a year ago. I was pleased with the quality of the sound. I thought this was a good deal. Six months later, it started playing through just one side. But wait, you say! These have a lifetime warranty so it's no trouble, you say! Yeah, only I paid to have the broken headphones shipped to the replacement center (AND I had to send a money order along with it so that they could ship them back). Now, with my replacement headphones, they're doing the same thing after only a few months! I won't be paying money to get ANOTHER replacement pair. It's just not worth it anymore. Do not buy these headphones."
3,Good sound but uncomfortable,"I bought these headphones based on the good reviews about the sound quality and the comfort, but I find them to be very uncomfortable. The collapsible band has two plastic pieces which press into the top of my head. There is no way to keep them away from my head without having the headset so loose that it falls off. Maybe I just have a small head or not enough hair but I like my Sennheiser PX100s better. They have a padded band which is very comfortable and I never feel the headset pressing on the top of my head and the sound quality is just as good."
3,They were good for awhile,"At first I really liked these, but then I noticed that they started to wearout. I only had them for a couple months and they started to develop a crackling noise in the background of my music. This only happens when I am listening to heavy bass, but it still is anoying. For people who don't listen to their music really loud, these are great, but I play my music very loud and go through phones pretty fast.I also found that I have stopped collapsing them down to save time on adjustments. The temple pads are okay, but do mess up your hair. My hair also gets caught in the plastic part that holds the metal band for size adjustment.Other than that... they were okay."
5,High Quality Sound Sets Performance Standard for Portable Listening,"Exceptionally rich, deep bass and a remarkably wide frequency response. Designed for those with refined musical acuity. Portable, lightweight."
5,Awesome!,"Great sound, intelligent design, and fantastic price. These headphones were exactly what I was looking for. I didn't want to spend a ton of money because I travel a lot and don't want to worry about my headphones getting lost of damaged, yet still want a quality sound. These are perfect."
5,Easily the best headphones under $50,"These headphones have great sound, really good bass, and the adjustment is nice and comfortable. The pads are soft, don't wear out. They might feel a little cheap (the actual speakers are in kind of a flimsy plastic cabinet), but there is just no better sound under $50. They don't just sound good, they sound great.In the end, can you really argue with more than 1100 reviews with nearly a 4.5 star average?"
3,Not For Me,"I can see how a lot of folks would really like these cans, but sadly they're not for me. I like a very crisp, open sound and find these entirely too bassy, and in some cases with too much distortion on the low end. It may be the kind of music I want them for--I listen mainly to electronic/chill. Too bad, cause I really like the way they feel. Almost weightless. And I actually like the retro styling (80's---retro???)Kudos for the non-clamshell packaging too."
4,Quality sound!,purchased the headphones and am perfectly satisfied with them! The quality is great. Very comfortable to wear!
4,"Fantastic sound, comfortable fit","I'm not an audio expert, but for the price I think this is the best over the ear sound available. I've been looking for ear buds that delivered great sound under a hundred bucks, but I happily ended up with these."
3,"Good sound quality, a little uncomfortable","After a long night of trying to decide which headphones to order, I chose the Koss PortaPro over the Sennheiser PX100. I don't have a problem with how the PortaPro headphones look, and I figured that the tried and true headphones from the 80's would be a good choice. The PortaPros really sound great, but after wearing them for 8 hours a day for two days at my job, I have decided that they aren't the most comfortable headphones. I haven't tried the Sennheisers, but at this point I am regretting my choice.Also, adjusting the headphones to your head every time you put them on is also quite annoying."
3,Incredible headphones for the money,"I've listened to music on some headphones twice the price of these (borrowed them) and they didn't sound anywhere near as good as these.They are so comfortable on my size 8 head (lots of thick hair as well), they really only touch my ears and the top of my head. They're a lot smaller than I thought they'd be for some reason, it's a little smaller than my ears, but that's not a problem at all.The sound is great, I plugged them in and started playing a favorite song, it sounded so good. The bass is really nice, I could feel it like never before, and unlike other headphones with stronger bass the sound wasn't muffled or muddy sounding.Best headset I ever bought, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for quality on a budget.Edit:It's been 4 months and I've got a serious rattle in my left ear, I'm going to have to spend $19 for shipping both ways. Not happy."
4,Great headphones - awesome warranty.,Had these for a couple years and then the left earphone came apart. Mailed it in to koss and they sent a brand new replacement. Great customer service.
5,Sounds better than headphones priced MUCH higher.,"I'm embarrassed to say how many pairs of earbuds I've purchased and thrown away. Often, the in-ear fit is uncomfortable. Other times, the earbuds slide out of the ear, and the sound quality is affected. These over-ear phones are very comfortable, and don't have the problem of an earbud slipping out of the ear.I'm fortunate to live near a Koss outlet store, and was able to sample nearly all of their products. These sounded better than many of their other headphones priced MUCH higher. Don't be fooled by the price. These headphones would be a value at double or triple the price."
4,"Great, with some issues","Heres the skinny,Pros: Great sound!I love the vintage look.Cons: They don't stay on your head very well.The metal band is annoyingthe comfortZone feature is nice but doesn't lock, I had to keep switching it back every 10 min.Also the cord is pretty short for earphones.honestly I like these, I just wish they'd fix these minor inconviences."
5,My son loves these headphones. Lifetime Warranty is great.,"At first my son wasn't sure about the retro look of these head phones. Now that he saw them in person, he wears them everyday. First pair came and the right didn't work. Amazon quickly exchanged it. Great deal"
2,Poor sound,"These headphones are designed well enough. However, the sound definitely leaves something to be desired. Way too much bass, muddy mids, and no highs whatsoever. It sounds like you're listening to your music through a wall. Well, ok, that's a slight exaggeration, but the sound on these is notably sub-par. My iPhone earbuds beat it for sound quality, and that's a pretty low bar.Look cool, though."
1,Broken after 2days,"My headphones fell down once from the table and were broken immediately, I will go for Sennheiser headphones next time."
3,Great product... slow amazon service!!!!,"The item showed up and worked great. My only complaint is that Amazon listed the item as in-stock yet took 3 days to process and ship. I got the item a week later.I highly advise getting this item however, I advise going somewhere else to get it."
1,TERRIBLE!!!,"I havent had these earphones 2 days, and already experiencing a shortage in the headphones. Sound quality is all aroung terrible. KEEP YOUR MONEY!!!!"
3,Sound is just average at best,I was very excited at first but was so disappointed as soon I pluged it into my MP3 player. Its sound is not any better than my old $15 sony mini headphone.
3,Fool me once...,"After waiting for over a week for the Post Office to redeliver this item, it was a complete letdown to open the box and find...that. I am furious with myself for buying these headphones and paying that much for what essentially amounts to something built for tiny heads and tiny ears. I was expecting a pair of large, comfortable headphones, but no! I feel duped and am angry that I waited so long for nothing. I will have to start a search for new headphones again and give this pair away."
4,Great cans!,"I was looking for a pair of headphones that had great sound quality and that didn't cut out all ambient noise.These delivered in all aspects and won me over with their vintage appeal. The sound is bright, crisp, undistorted and they are also very comfortable while wearing eyeglasses.I was tempted by Vintage cans like the Sennheiser HD414s but the used prices are a little hard to justify when compared to the Koss PortaPros. The HD414s also need a powerful amp for them to shine and I'm just plugging into my Mac and iPod most of the time.The Koss PortaPros are the ultimate in retro chic and for the price you'd be hard-pressed to find another set that rivals their sound quality and design."
5,Congratulations,The product is excellent and caters for those who like to hear serious profuntos. The seller is also excellent and everything arrived as agreed. I recommend anyone who likes quality products. Congratulations
4,Nice!,"I already had the Koss PortaPro and decided to get a second pair. I have this small headphone connection gadget that allows 3 headphones to connect and hear audio, that's why I bought it from the get-go. It's lightweight and you can hear the db ranges nicely. Good enough for me! Thumbs up on this deal!"
4,Fantastic bang for the buck,"You'd be hard pressed to find a better pair of headphones for this price. And believe me, I've looked. And I've tried. And I've experienced the alternatives.Sound quality is decent, with very good clarity, and a degree of loudness that doesn't sacrifice fidelity for its own sake (unlike that of 99% of mass-market headphones). You're not going to get concert-quality sound from these cans, nor should you expect it. But you'll get sound that is literally indistinguishable from that produced by many headphones offered at 4x this price.The styling of the phones leaves something to be desired. But I didn't buy these for the looks. If you're concerned about your public image, and need phones you can run around with outdoors, perhaps you should look elsewhere."
2,2nd time is NOT the charm,"I had a pair of Portapros for years and years. When they finally wore out, I didn't feel bad replacing them. I bought a second pair on Amazon last year (2012) and the wire at the plug has already broken on them despite careful use. Reading the Sportapro review, the plug seems to be a weak link and I'm afraid that the Portapros have the same issue now. It's really a bummer, they used to be GREAT. Not sure what to replace them with."
4,Great sound,I love this product. I used to have a pair when I was in college ages ago but unfortunately they are very fragile and are very easily damaged.. I had to replace them with the Grado Prestige Series SR-60i. Still a nice product though.
4,Good value,"I've been using them for almost a year now. Sound is very good, not fabulous. Could be a bit crisper and have more presence. If you like bass, this is your set- awesome (too much for my taste, really). Nice not to have to stick anything inside your ear. Pops open too easily when folded up. Sometimes pulls at your hair when resizing it on your head. An earpad has popped out of its socket a couple of times, but it pops right back in- seems fragile but is more durable than it looks. Adjusting tabs on each side reset when you take if off your head. Consider whether you would rather have noise-canceling or inline volume adjuster before you decide. If not, it's a good choice and a good value.May 2010 update: I had one of the cords pull out of the earpiece and sent it back to the company for a replacement- only paid shipping. They sent me a new unit. It's cheap, it's good, and it's a keeper in my book, even 5 years later.Feb. 2012 update: Still going strong."
1,Cheaply made and will fail. Having serviced under warranty = $,"I would like these headphones if the workmanship weren't so shoddy. After two months of irregular use and careful handling, the insulation on the cord where it meets the plug has pulled away, leaving the fragile inner wires exposed. Swell. Having them serviced under warranty is going to cost about $20.00, w/ shipping and handling etc. Great.Koss. Where ""quality"" is word two. Word one is ""poor."""
3,Nice sound but poor design,"The sound from PortaPro is excellent: deep bass (15Hz), precise (<0.2% distortion), and a wide frequency range (15-25,000 Hz). These are the things I look for in headphones. However, it didn't last long. In 3 months of use, the wire at the jack broke, resulting in no sound in the right ear. In addition, the metal piece sometimes pulls off hair when putting on or taking off the headphone, so there's some physical pain there which I did not expect."
3,2 pairs defective,"they work great but after a year, both pair now have sound in only one side of headphones.""manuf. has a LIFETIME LIMITED WARRANTY""who do I contact for replacement of these AWESOME HEADPHONES?alex"
3,Great sounding...but broke on the first day,"These headphones have deep bass and an overall equal balance of sound. They also felt comfortable on my head without having to adjust them. When I went to do so, however, the metal came loose from the track, leaving the pair in two halves. There are holes located on the two metal band halves where it is supposed to click so they are on the tracker, simple design, although my one tracker on the left side did not seem to fit the right metal band. Either way you look at it, the headphones broke on me the first day I used them, about the second time upon use."
4,The sound is simply the best,"Why does a cheap set of headphones with weird plastic ear-cups and a metal band that catches in your hair get so many five star reviews? Because they sound amazing. Nothing in this price range even comes close. Most people compare these with the Sennheiser PX100 II. Well, I have both and they are both excellent headphones, and the sennheisers are much better quality, but the sound of the Portapros is much better. I am on my second pair, and will buy another when this set breaks."
4,A safe choice,"Having (ab)used these continuously for about nine months, my impression is that they offer decent sound quality in an easily portable package. I have had difficulty with one headphone popping off the frame (I believe I ran into the problem three times in the first three months), but it easily snapped back on, no loss. For an economical, portable headphone, I recommend it, but with a warning that my pair (my thoroughly abused pair, I reiterate) developed an intermittent failure in one earphone at the end of this period."
2,Plug redesign ruined the perfect headphones.,"Was a faithful user of these headphones for years and years and they were perfect. Unfortunately, a few years back they eliminated the right-angle plug and when I ordered the 25th anniversary pair and a subsequent regular pair, both quit on me within a few months. The plug is unstable and the right or left earpiece goes out. I returned them under warranty (which is great) but the headphones I got back went out in one of the earpieces within months of light use. Very sad because I was the biggest fan of these headphones. I've moved on and will not order these again. I feel like I'm in mourning over the loss. Portapros now relegated to the useless headphone junkyard. I would guess most of the positive reviews are from users who got these before the redesign."
5,By far the best headphones for the price,"These headphones sound amazing. They are the best headphones that don't cover your whole ear, great bass, nice adjustments. The price is completely unbeatable, there are just no better headphones under $50 out there. No chance. These kick ass."
5,Koss PortaPros,"This is the second set of these wonderfull headphones. Because of my abuse of the first set, I had to replace them. These headphones have a super nice sound with a solid bass response. I have tried other headphones and for the money they cannot be beat."
5,Magnificent Sound,"I was looking for a great sounding set of headphones at a reasonable price, the Koss PortaPros sound as good as the expensive models at a fraction of the price. I was skeptical, but upon listening was a believer instantly."
4,koss portapro/ rlt in mexico,"wanted anything to replace earbuds spec. for use with my mp3 players. this set is perfect for my needs. stays in place,sound quality close to ideal,very comfortable. these look large and odd in the add photo,but in fact are not at all strange or oversize. am pleased way beyond expectations.first review ever,cannot type,but am so pleased to dump earbuds had to respond. thanks."
3,Good Sound But Comfort Lacking,"Sounds better than the Sennheiser PX 200 but the folding and retracting mechanism is awkward. The adjustable pressure cushion has 3 settings from firm to soft but it has a tendency to pop back to the default firm setting. What irks me is the folding hook - it cuts into my ear. Sound wise, it has good bass and clarity."
5,"Awesome Quailty, Good buy.","I was skeptical at first being these were a bit on the [$$$] side for headphones. However, when i recived them i used them with my MP3/CD player and it gave me AWESOME quality. I was amazed at the stereo effect, furthermore i tried these on my computer, laptop and desktop, and in my stereo downstairs, with the included attachment. All sounds were VERY clear and stereoed wonderfully. KOSS has always been a good brand in my book but these are defininitly worth the price! If you are skeptical about the price don't be. The quality is worth it."
5,Good where it counts,"The first thing that needs to be said about these headphones is that they are really ugly. There can be no denying it. The weird earpieces with the bar atop is just ugly, ugly, ugly. That said, these are easily the most comfortable portables I've worn, a situation largely a product of the very features that make the set ugly. Additionally, the sound is good. I don't feel the sound is as orgasmically supreme as other reviewers suggest, but the sound is very good. If you listen to a lot of Jazz or classical, some senns might serve you better. If you listen to more rock and hip hop, you'll be pleased with the portapros, if only for the comfort, which is truly exceptional. I use them with my iPod, and am well pleased."
4,Very good sound at a reasonable cost,"I purchased these headphones because of the number of very good to excellent reviews I had read about them. They haven't disappointed me, as I've found the sound excellent, simple portability, and at a value price."
5,(To The Point) Great Headphones Worth More Than You'll Pay,"I don't want to spend too much time on my review because it probably won't be read.I have recently bought these headphones for 31 dollars here on amazon and I'd say they are a steal.They can be comfortable but you'll first have to tinker with them for a while to get them just right. I strongly recommend you DON'T put the upper pad directly on your temple (you will feel extreme discomfort), instead put them slightly behind or above your temple (you are welcome for saving you a lot time.)The sound quality is very good. I bought these after my Bose around-ear headphones broke after only a year. I've concluded these koss have almost the same quality, but they still do not have the amazing clarity as the 130$ Bose. They have a wide range of sound and responsive and superb bass. I listen to a especially wide range of music (From Black Metal to Intelligent Dance Music(IDM)) and these definitely preform. BUY THEM!!!!"
5,koss portapro,"Comfy, great sound, very portable, low cost; if these are your needs, buy Koss portapros! I keep them in a zip-lock bag with my nano...always on hand. The case was too small to fool with, and the headphones don't cancel outside noise, but they are the headphones I carry everywhere and I will buy new portapros in a heartbeat if anything happens to these!!!"
4,good sound,"This headphones have a great sound very good I could say ,but they are very fragile,think carefully before buying,but if you want good sound this is what you need"
5,great value for money,"I have owned these for over 10 years(?) and they're excellent - great sound, good fit, light, highly portable and come with lifetime warranty. In fact, one of cords had become loose some years ago and Koss fixed it(at $6 S&H cost)and replaced the worn-out cushions. They have served me very well. Highly recommended."
3,Not for acoustic music,"The ""Sound"" leans more towards hip hop/ is base and beats heavy. You wouldnt want to hear some acoustic music on it. For that matter Jazz would be more suitable on some other headphones as well."
4,Pleased with decision,"I purchased these as a gift for my husband, after he researched and decided it was what he wanted. He has been using them during cardio exercises and enjoys the quality of the music. He also says the ear pads are pretty comfortable but sometimes the metal on the top of his head is not so comfortable. He keeps his hair really short and I think that is part of the problem. Overall he is happy with them."
3,Good for the money but could be better,"From all the positive reviews out there, I was thinking that these headphones would blow me away. In short, the sound is noticeably better than some of the off the shelf headphones out there, but it definitely did not blow me away. I thought it would have a richer bass and a crisper sound. The sound is rich and crisp enough but I was thinking that it would be extraordinary. But it is still a good pair of headphones especially for the money. Some of the other reviews mentioned that hair can snag along the metal headband and this is definitely an issue. Be careful or you will see and feel the hair loss."
3,Koss Headphone review,The mechanical linkage for the ear pieces would click when I walked with these on which was very unpleasant.
5,"Have a set I bought 10 years ago, still sound great!","The version I have is the Portapro-2. Only needed to replace the foam ear pieces which are pretty cheap from Koss. Ordered a few sets of foam to save $ over time.Great freq response, especially compaired to earbuds in the same price range."
5,KOSS Best,"I highly recommend the Koss Portapro headphone to any audio enthusiast out there. The sound quality is unbelievable, portability and the reasonable price is unbeatable. I put away my Bose in ear headphone as soon as I tried listening to it. The sound is crisp, crystal clear with plenty of bass. Highs and lows can really be heard. Highly recommended."
5,"Great stuff, dependable","This is my second pair. I have gone through the muck of Walmart shelf dog doody brands made of cheap plastic and these by far exceed the others for longevity and quality of sound, and price. I never need a mike anyway, and if I did I'd prefer it to be a separate unit anyway, so only one item at a time was out of commission instead of both."
3,Koss PortaPro headphone review,"These headphones are slightly above average. They are definitely not anything extraordinary like all of these 5 star people seem to over-hype them up to be.Pros:Good solid deep bassGreat sound qualitySmall and portableComfortable (NOT anything amazing though)Decent price of $32.99Cons:Poor design and constructionVery cheap feelAnnoying wire connectionHair pullingI mean it's really up to you. Based on the extremely poor design, construction and feel, I would not recommend these headphones over Sennheiser brand headphones. You pay $32.99 for these as opposed to better valued Sennheiser headphones that are generally below $30.I give the Koss Portopro headphones a solid 3 stars; mostly for overall good sound quality and bass. In the end, it really depends on what features you are looking for. If you want some good DURABLE comfortable headphones, these are NOT your best bet (probably why they come with a lifetime warranty - which I am skeptical about btw)..."
4,Good Product,"Good product for the cost. Good sound quality, folds easily and can be used a variety of settings. Nice price"
4,Great bass in a little package!,"Wow. I was not expecting that much bass from these headphones! These things may LOOK small and cheap, but they're not by any means!These headphones are for bass lovers on a tight budget. If you enjoy music with a lot of highs and mids, then don't bother with these; the highs and mids are too muddy. Foam-pad mods and/or some good burn-in should help balance them out.If you're a casual listener, then you can't go wrong with these."
4,Look Awful Sound Amazing,Super cheezy look. and they always want to shrink up and do grab your hair a bit but it's worth every bit of the trouble for the fantastic sound. exactly what I wanted for much less than I wanted to pay.
4,Excellent for the 80s. Just good by today's standards.,"These headphones provide the best bang for your headphone dollar. For a sub $40 price, you can get a headphone that is better than twice its price. But it is not better than most premium headphones that cost over $200.The bass, which was great by 80s standards, can't handle the lower frequencies as well as high end Shure earphones. Otherwise, there is very little distortion of the sound.The level of detail in the sound is impressive. I did hear many sounds (mainly percussion instruments and background guitar music) which I couldn't hear with my inferior iPod headphones. But again, the level of detail is not as good as Shure earphones.If you are on a budget and want to replace your uncomfortable and inferior iPod headphones with something superior, then this headphone is great. Unless you want to look retro 80s, however, you may want to wear them inside."
5,Porta Pro vs Sennheiser 100's,"OK....so here goes another comparison between the Koss Portpros and the Sennheiser 100's? I am not going to bore you..Both headphones are outstanding performers with an Ipod...I own them both...So which one is my preference? The Sennheisers, for one reason only...People use their Ipods in malls and on the go. There are times when I want to remove the phones from my ears for a few moments (say, in a store or when having conversation).With the Sennheisers, I can remove the phones from my ears and let them ""hang"" around my neck in comfort...Try this with the Koss's and they will place a stranglehold on you. For this reason alone, I recommend the Senn's. Both,in my humble opinion, sound equally good."
1,Not such a good value after all.,"I use these lightly, perhaps 3-4 hours per week, and I baby them. Yet the cord has failed TWICE near where the cord meets the plug. One of the headphones cuts out. So, every 9 months I've been sending these back to Koss, who charges $9 for shipping/handling, plus I pay $6 to ship them to Koss. Total = $15. So now these are $35 +$15 + $15 = $65 headphones, not including the hassle of them breaking and having to ship them back.So I don't recommend these PortaPros anymore. Sorry Koss."
2,Bad wires,"The cords always seemed stiff. The wires broke inside the cords at the strain relief after six months. Almost any removal of the phones causes them to reset to the tightest fitting. Good sound, but generally poor design."
4,Very Good Headphones,"I got these to help compensate for some hearing loss I've sustained that make ear buds a poor choice for me- sound quality is remarkable for on-ear type headphones, they are light weight and comfortable to wear(even in a HOT commercial kitchen). Good choice for active listeners- so far, everything from Mahler to Clifford Brown sounds great."
3,Easily beak at the connector,"These are wonderful sounding headphones and very comfortable to wear for long periods. However, the wire at the mini plugconnector frays and breaks easily. The wire frays, one channel goes out and they're finished. If only Koss would use a sturdier connectorthese headphones would be perfect."
5,Look lower level but sound upper level,Same style since they began production back in 1984 but I think they still look cool. Comfortable and I hate on ear headphones. They sound amazing. Bass is surprisingly strong and the mid and high levels are still present and sound good. The mids and highs can get washed out but some work on the equlalzier can easily fix that problem. Honestly they look a little cheap but they are worth every penny.
1,Broke quickly and warranty is misleading.,"These headphones initially were a pleasant surprise with good sound, fit, and styling. However, after less than a month and very little use at that, the right headphone stopped working. Although it has a lifetime warranty, you not only have to pay to ship it to Koss for service, you also have to pay an additional $9 for return shipping irregardless of the defect. The return shipping is already about 25% of the total cost of the headphones new to begin with. Add the price to ship it initially and you're looking at spending approximately 50% of the total headphone price in order to take advantage of the so called lifetime warranty. Of course they offer a lifetime warranty, it's not worth it for folks to use it. This is a bad deal. Don't buy it!!"
4,Great Value,"Good sound, very comfortable. The included case is an afterthought however, a hard case would be ideal.Would recommend to others looking for good headphones in the ""under 50 dollar"" category."
3,I remember the good ol' days,"I have just received my second pair of Koss Portapros. The first pair I had were fantastic; crisp sound, comfortable, convenient. This new pair... not so much. Koss are definitely cutting costs, and this has significantly worsened the quality of the Portapros. Quite simply, they feel cheaper. The foam that cushions your head and ears is no longer spongey and smooth, its hard and rough! The sound quality has also significantly worsened - I'm not an audiophile but the difference is clear! The wire feels cheap. To conclude, Koss has lost a customer. Looking for a new pair of great budget headphones.."
3,Flimsy headphones,"Headphones are flimsy and made of cheap material. This is nothing aesthetically pleasing about the Koss PortaPro. One of the earpiece cushions had wear and tear after the first day of use. I immediately returned the headphones to Amazon for a full refund. Amazon even refunded shipping charges. The Koss PortaPro's sound quality is clear and pleasing with good bass, but I would recommend the Koss KSC75 which has a richer fuller sound and it cost half as much."
2,Great sound but VERY uncomfortable,"Based on other reviewers' comments I decided to try the Koss headphones. Unfortunately, these are the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever worn. I wear glasses which I believe is the reason. I have since purchased and have been wearing the Sennheiser PX200 headphones. Although the sound quality is not quite as good, the comfort of the PX 200 is superior. In addition, the PX200 block more external noise. I highly recommend the PX 200's to anyone who wears glasses."
3,"Good sound, bad construction.","Maybe it's cause I'm spoiled by the Koss SportaPro headphones that are $10 cheaper and fold into streetstyle wear, but these just seem damned flimsy. Mind you, the SportaPros aren't much better built, but they're at least a little more functional with the same great sound quality. I expected a lot more for the $50 I spent (with shipping). They *do* have very good sound, but I feel like I'm gonna break them by mistake carrying them around in my backpack. Like having a really expensive pair of glasses in a mosh pit. My advice, if you're using these outside your home, go with the cheaper sportapros. They can go streetwear style which can be a real advantage at times and they're the same quality sound at a cheaper price."
4,Happy w/Headphones,"Like many other people, I hate those iPod earbuds. After reading the other reviews I decided to try these. I have no regrets!Sure they aren't the nicest looking things, but I am not too worried how they look on me. I just want decent sound, and these truly give me really, really good sound. They fold up into a smaller ball, and that is important for me and my daily commute downtown. I can easily shove these into my backpack and when it is time to start my music up, I can grab 'em and unfold them in seconds and start jamming immediately.My only wish is this: the iPod earbuds had that sliding knob on the cable to keep the separate ear wires together. Without this knob I find the wires fairly tangled and hard to unravel sometimes. I would have liked this feature on these headphones as well.Again, great sound, very happy."
4,PortaPro and Rio S35S,"Just got my PortaPros today and they sound great with my Rio S35S. Base is wonderful. Sound is so much better than the buds that came with the Rio. Can't seem to shake them off of my head so hopefully they stay on while running.Wish they held the adjustment, and looked better, but they sound great, and that's what matters most."
1,Broke after one trip,"Sound quality: Decent. Comfort: Not good, but bearable. Travel Durability: Abysmal. Like, I went on one trip and one of the earpieces broke off at the cheap plastic pins that hold it on to the frame. I had a pair of Sony's that I owned for three years and went on twenty trips with no problem. Eventually the cord got frayed and I had to replace it with this piece of garbage. Maybe I just had bad luck. Probably not though. On my flight back, sitting between fat hick who decided to invade my seat space with passive aggressive knee touching which doesn't work with my crusty former Marine mentality (I turned that row into a warzone with that idiot) and a neurotic aged Woody Allen type who had diarrhea of the mouth and couldn't shut up I reached for my trusty noise killers. Only to discover to my horror that the cheap P.O.S. had broken. If somebody's little Damien had been wailing behind me like my last trip it would have been unbearable."
3,Good not Great,"I bought this based on user reviews..The headphones sounded nice, but don't be fooled. These are under $50 for a reason. They Can Not Compete with higher priced headphones. If you are serious about sound quality, you will get what you pay for and nothing more.For the price though, they are probably the best set out there."
