4,A bit funny and a bit depressing.,"This is a movie about a young man who is diagnosed with cancer, while he and his friend try to deal with it together. His mother is a bit ""smothering"" and his girlfriend is unable to persevere. He develops a rapport with a young woman who is a therapist in training. A sometimes depressing and sometimes funny movie, it seems to bring the real-life difficulties for a man diagnosed with a life-threatening disease at such a young age. Starting out a bit iffy, the movie gets better as it goes along and in the end it provides a strong emotional punch."
2,Why is this listed as a comedy?,"It wasn't funny and yes, going into it, I knew what it was about, but it was not a comedy at all. It was actually quite depressing, but not in a way that really made an impact other then making me feel awkward. I expected a lot more from this movie."
2,Just below 50/50,Not quite worth the time watching. 3rd Rock dude is a good actor but the movie just falls short of a go-see vote. Look for this one in the free sections of most movie download sites soon...
3,50/50 Movie Review,Interesting film about friendship. Has funny and poignant moments. The actors suck you into the story. Worth watching and was very easy to download from Amazon.
5,great movie,great movie. uses humor in the most healing sense. would recommend for everyone to have a better awareness of how to deal with themselves and others who are dealing with cancer as well as larger philosophical life questions.
1,Disappointing,"I found this book to be rather disappointing. As a mathematician, I was appalled at some of the errors made by the author (such as printing an incorrect value for the square root of two). The title promises intrigue and answers, but fails to deliver. I do not recommend this book."
1,A superficial and inane summary of childish math history.,"This book was full of incomplete, poorly written, and uninformative fictional anecdotes attempting to recreate historical situations. The stories are incomplete and boring. This is a childrens book."
5,Best Case for the money!,"Zen, way better than the Ipod, still its hard to find a good case. I bought this one, and its gosh darn good for the $. Smooth feeling, inexpensive, buttons work fine on it. Basically i'm very happy with the product and company, extremely fast shipping!"
1,Does not fit on a 60GB Zen,"I just bought this case and while it does look pretty good, it absolutely does not work with a 60GB Zen Vision: M. I finally managed to stuff my Zen into it, and it would not turn on because the buttons were being squeezed too tightly. It might be OK for a 30GB, I can't say, but don't buy it for a 60GB."
1,NOT FOR THE 60MB ZEN!,"I'm sure this is a wonderful case for the 30MB version of the ZEN, but it absolutely does not work for the 60MB ZEN. They should place a warning label on this product. Or at least specify that it is only compatible with the 30MB."
1,This product sucked,"I bought this product and i can't say that I am impressed. The case is to small for the player. When i tryed to put the player in the case it was a tight fit, when i finally got it in the case the bottom buttons on the player were being pushed down by the case. This case also adds a lot of bulk to the player as well and is very uncomfortable to use. Don't listen to anybody who thinks this product was great, they are lying."
1,Awful quality. Don't by if you love HD movies,"Pros: Great movieCons: Quality, it does indeed looks like a normal DVD, I did not believe the reviews that said such thing, but it is true. So, if you love buying Blu-rays movies with very good picture quality, then do not buy this one. I even own older movies available in Blu ray that look much better than this one."
3,bad mix,"The sound of this album is not good, because it's difficult to hear the keaboards of Andy Bown, the sound of the guitars are too in the background, the voices of the singers too, the drums and the bass are too in the front. Don't buy this album and wait the new remaster double CD ( full set) for december 2005 with an new mix by Tim Turan."
4,Good product,"These are needed in my shop, only set back is the quantity. A 2-pack is too little amount. Should be a 6 pack available. They work great and are an imported product. I am happy with them."
3,Do you enjoy theatre of the absurd?,If so you will enjoy these plays that combine political commentary with dry humor. The author's story is also interesting.
3,Sent Back- too much trouble charging.,This connected to the Bluetooth on my Mac Mini and worked fine untill batteries went dead after initial charge and an hour of use. Would not recharge. I emailed Macally and they responded to turn mouse off before placing on charger. Super tiny little switch on mouse bottom. Still wouldn't charge so I took batteries out and reinstalled. It charged but would not recharge even with switch off.I bought this to make life simpler and to free up a usb port. My Microsoft wireless mouse's receiver is now plugged back in and it works flawlessly as always. Batteries last 3-4 months with daily use.Amazon gladly took it back though and even paid postage back- no hassle.
1,"Sucks. Just doesn't work. Other then that, good form factor.","Like everyone else said. Charger is broken and doesn't work. Mouse falls asleep randomly, after 10 seconds idle. Mouse fails to sync or wake entirely. Mouse just plain doesn't work.The form factor is nice and fits well in my hand. It just doesn't work. I've tried three of them. All three experienced the exact same problem (I purchased three, used them on three different machines). There is no doubt that this mouse just plain sucks."
1,Garbage,"Worst mouse I've ever bought, hands down. First one lasted all of 3 days. Then it stopped charging, wouldn't pair with the computer, the red LED on the bottom wouldn't even come on to signify it was moving over something. Sent it back and got a replacement. This one lasted a week and a half, then the same thing. It just stopped working all of a sudden. I tried swapping out batteries, leaving it to ""fully charge"", re-pair with the computer. It's completely dead. I did everything I was supposed to, followed the manual, left it on the charge station when I wasn't using it, etc etc.I had another cheap Macally wired mouse a few years ago that was also a piece of junk. I figured since this one actually cost a bit of money the quality might be better. My mistake. I'll never buy a Macally product again."
1,"Save your money, save your time","This mouse has wasted more of my time than will ever be worth the $40 I paid for it. Do yourself a favor, and get the more expensive, non-off brand bluetooth mouse. I am on my second BT mouse after I sent the first one back in because it stopped working (even with new batteries). The package was lost in the mail, so I spent 2.5 months waiting for a replacement. Luckily customer service was helpful in this regard, but it still didn't make up for the poor quality of the product."
1,Poor Product Quality,"Nothing but problems with this poor quality mouse. Typically, I like Macally products but have lost faith in their wireless versions. This mouse loses it's connection several times throughout the day. I had to return the first one after about a month and half when it stopped responding completely. Today my second one has also died. The light comes on for about a second then again no response and will not make a connection. I have replaced batteries, tried different physical locations, and computers. Don't buy this mouse!"
4,Macally BTMOUSE Bluetooth Full Size Mouse,"Overall this is a good product, although it does have a delay once it is turned on. Can take up to 30 seconds for the mouse to sync with the bluetooth on our Mac."
4,Jiu-Jitsu,the video is great- this instructional video is at the perfect pace- and is very accurate in its moves
4,Cesar Gracie Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu & Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Grappling Instructional Series,This DVD collection is everything I expected and then some. I'm very happy with my purchase.
5,Cesar Gracie Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu & Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Grappling Instructional Series,"This is a great product. I am recently a new fan to the UFC, and have begun to take notice of the power of ju-jitsu, i bought this tape as an enthusiast to the sport and its has given me great insight. Cesar speaks very good english and explains the moves very clearly step by step. He will show you how to do the move from several different angels, and is very good at explaing what you should be doing at a given time during the move. My only complaint is i would have like to seen a better scence selection. Currently each dvd is spli tinto 3 parts, with each part containing several moves... it would have been nice to be able to choose exactly which move you want to review, without having to fast forward through the parts. I give this dvd a 9 out of 10"
3,Awesome techniques...,...too bad you cant select the techniques from a menu library. I'll wear out the forward and back button just getting to the parts I want.
5,Every new BJJ Fighter should own a copy!,"During my first 5 days of BJJ lessons, the instructor would show the whole class certain moves and we would practice it with a partner. When it came down to ""rolling"" during my first few lessons, I didn't know what to do. I kept getting tapped out or choked while in the guard and didn't have any moves to apply or really know what I was doing or how to defend. I didn't have any GAME. After watching the video it dawned on me. This video tighten my GAME and I am no longer being used as a training dummy. Suddenly I'm a challenge to the Advanced Players, I'm not that easy to tap out anymore. Thanks to this video! What I really like about this Video is that Cesar Gracie goes over the moves in different angles and explains in great detail on how to execute, and apply the techniques correctly and the reason behind each move. EXCELLENT WORK! JOB WELL DONE!"
4,Excellent...but you can get something just as good/better for less money!,"I bought both this and the Ultimate Winning Techniques video (see my review). This video is awesome, but it is so ""drawn out"" I almost fall asleep watching it. I have only made it through the first video. They talk too much and go over and over the same moves to the point it gets boring. I have a rewind button...I don't need every little detail done over and over 5 times! The videos are excellent, you will learn what you need to learn from the best school in the world, but I think for a beginner you may just rather spend the $17 and get the other video I purchased. If my point of view changes if I ever have the patience to get through the 2nd and 3rd DVD's, I'll let you know!"
5,works great for me,I bought this product over six months ago and it has been nothing but good to me. My kids use it to watch there dvd movies all the time and the love it. I would recomend this product to anyone looking for a quality combo at a good price.
1,miss led,the product was not what I was told it was harbor bay which now is CM line. I wanted GF. Sent it back very disappointed.
1,Highly UNSATISFIED One time Customer,"Order product and it arrived damaged. Returned product to address n the box, but seller claimed to have NEVER received the product. I am out of my merchandise AND my money for the plant and postage times 2. I have emailed the seller on sseveral occasions, but still there hasbeen no resolve or offer to even try. I will never order from this seller again and will definately make my co-workers, friends, and family aware of his poor business practices."
2,i wanted to like it..,"The story sounded interesting enough, but it was so poorly written that I couldn't even make it through the first chapter. Cliche after cliche.."
5,Dancing through the night.....,"Shadowdance was my first introduction to the world of SciFi & Fantasy. Few books I've read have brought both tears and joy to my eyes. I loved Robin's poetic words to describe ordinary objects and the way the author took me to the dark side of sex and mankind. Robin's character development and use of gay overtones added a beautiful dimension to the fantasy. The love between Innowen and Razkilli gave me, a gay reader, an emotional feeling I could identify with."
1,"Did not work at all with my Treo 680, although the outside of the box said it would.","This item did not work at all with my Treo 680, although the outside of the box said it would. Inside was a battery marked for the Treo 750. It fit into my 680, but too snugly, sort of had to force it in there. Phone would not work, I thought maybe it neeeded a charge overnight, but still no go.i returned it, and they sent the same packaging and the same (differently marked) item inside. Again, snug. Again, I tried to charge it. I gave up and spent considerably more for a perfectly working battery from Palm."
2,Too small.,The diamonds are so small that you can hardly see them. For $700.00 it was way over priced.$100.00 was closer to the actual price.
3,Not Sure,"The product works ok if you know what you are doing. It does not tell temp, which is a problem for us who know very little about how to dehydrate anything. The directions should be more spicific and understandable."
4,Love it,"My boyfriend and I have been using this around the clock , only wish we had of bought more trays to go with it . Shipped in timely matter and fast , would recommend to anyone ."
4,Unexpected Glitches,"The product is good... overall... but anymore, after a few weeks, it starts turning itself off (which it isn't supposed to) Also, you can't find nutrition info on the seasoning packets, which is dangerous for a diabetic like me.Otherwise it works nice and makes good jerky and apple chips."
3,nesco fd-28jx,i have this food dehydrator it is ok but i wish that i would of payd $5 more to get a bettter one and if u wanna use this dehydrator to make fruit roll ups it is hard to find the sheets
3,came in original packaging,"i ordered this for my husband as a gift, i even marked the little box that specified it was a gift. it arrived on time, but when ups showed up to deliver, my husband was standing there and saw immediately what his gift was. i would assume that when you check the box confirming that it's a gift, i wouldn't show up in the original box!"
2,Constantly Breaking,"I bought this dehydrator as a birthday gift for my husband. As soon as he plugged it in the motor blew up, literally. Nesco did send a replacement and the machine worked great for the next 3 sets of jerky dehydrations. Now, the motor will automatically shut off after about 15 minutes. I wonder if it is overheating and shutting off to protect itself. When working the jerky comes out great, but I have had way too many issues and am junking this machine and switching brands."
3,Torn Away from the pages of 1988,"I bought this when it came out in 1988, after seeing the band perform ""Torn Away"" on MTV. At that point, MTV was still playing a lot of hair metal (bon jovi, GNR, etc.), which i detested, so this stood out to me as different but still palatable to the general public. Torn Away is a upbeat rock song with a melodic hook, a catchy song that still sounds good today. The sax solo might date it a bit, but its no John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band. The album is much less subversive and more polished than Husker Du and the Replacements, but not a total sell out either. A bit of country influence on some of the songs. It's not a great album, but it has its good points.Mark Linkous of this band went on to form the better known Sparklehorse. The sound is not the same, but you might still like it."
4,Excellent book to see if your salary keeps up with inflation,"Excellent statistical narrative that will allow you to gauge your home appreciation or weekly salary wrt the consumer price index. The results can be quite fascinating. For instance the 35 cent a gallon gasoline in 1973 should be 1.35 today. Or a 15,000 home in 1960 should be 87,000 today. For those penny pinchers like myself who are always trying to second guess the platitudes of our company pay raise proposals, this book will allow you to keep em straight. The primary shortcoming with this book though is that it ends in 1991. A revision really does need to be published yearly or otherwise each additional year after 1991 most be interpolated individually. Mr McCusker please update next year."
2,Concise... not neccesarily a compliment,"In this book, the first 70 pages are devoted to the actual book chapters. When you take into account the pictures (which are not really mind-blowing) and the large font, there is really not much meat to the book. It does not really describe anything that you couldn't read in a single magazine article or encyclopedia entry. The bulk of the book (the last 100 pages) is given over to poor reproductions of various documents, none of which are very exciting.All in all, for the price, I can't complain too much, thus the two stars; one for the content and one for the value.I would put the price of this towards a more comprehensive book."
5,Good fit,These fit my carbon express select shafts perfect. I glued them in myself and saved a few bucks not having to go to the archery shop or buy new arrows. Arrows are expensive!
5,ideal book for the origami beginner,"Are you a frustrated folder? Do you have trouble followingtraditional origami diagrams? Then this book is for you.Clear, precise step by step photos lead the beginner througha variety of models.I was never able to figure out how to fold origami before,but this book taught me how to do it. Believe me when Itell you, that says a lot for this book!"
5,Simple to intermediate folds that are well illustrated.,One of the better books that I have seen for the beginner. Step-by-step photographs make it easy to learn. It quickly re-acquainted me with the art after a 14-year break from paper folding.
3,Better instructions but the cover pic is most interesting,"I ordered several orgami books at the same time & overall disappointed in the offerings, but this book does have very clear instructions (if you saw the other books, you could greatly appreciate this fact). I would rate this with 5 stars if the cover pic was indicative of the book, instead of the most interesting, or where it start from instead of ending with. It's like a movie trailer that makes you want to see the movie & when you do, the trailer had the only good parts to it. Mostly fillers that you learned from your classmates as small children, like the water bomb, paper hat, fortune teller & the popper."
5,It Made Me Cry,"Lisa did a wonderful job with this book. The only time I put it down was when I had to reach for my tissue. It has been a very long time since a story has touched me like this one. Anyone who has had cancer touch their lives should read this book. Anyone who has never had any experience with the dreaded ""C"" word, should read this book! It was truly inspirational, and yet at the same time, heart-rending!"
4,the mann,yeah i got this album because it has a lot of good bay area rappers that i like. the album was pretty tight. the track with e40 and 11-5 was the best though. the only downfall was that the prodution fell a little short of my expectations. hats off to everyone on it. louie loc will be tha sh....
5,Life changing content,"Life changing content! Over 800 questions about life answered. Answers questions like, What is the purpose of life? When did time begin. Which came first - the chicken or the egg?"
5,What a sad book!,"I met Mike Jacobs at the Dallas Holocaust Memorial Center and he told me about his experience with the Holocaust. He sold me his book, with his signature on it and it said:Remember, ""Never Again!"" with all good wishes. Have Hope, Believe, and Think Positive!I really do admire Mike Jacob's courage and stregnth that got him through WWII. I encourage you to read this book! That way, when you think YOUR life is bad, you will remember Mike Jacob's triumph over tragedy, and how HE got through it!God Bless you, Mike Jacob!!"
3,Libertus mystery,"My first reading of this author, a bit slow in starting. I have ordered others in the series."
4,Sticks with you,"When I watched this movie, I found it amusing. There were bits that made me laugh out loud, but I also felt at the time that it should have been funnier. I watched it again because my boyfriend wanted to see it, and noticed things I had not before. But now a few months later, things from the movie keep coming back to me and I realize they are absolutely hilarious. I am going to buy the movie because it truly is one that requires a number of watchings, and each time something new hits you. I also find myself thinking of the movie(in a funny, but frightening way) when I see something in the media or advertizing that almost seems to come from the movie, and not in a satirical way! Seriously, there are drink ads on TV that could easily be Brawndo (it has electrolytes!)."
4,Painfully hilarious,"Idiocracy is full of laughs, but it carries a serious warning as well. The movie is choc-full of great lines that you and your friends can sling at each other for the rest of your lives. However, some of the people in the movie are so stupid that you have to make sure your brain is still working after you watch the film. The signs of man's dumbing down are already very prominent. I recommend this film to everyone who can handle humor and profanity."
1,"Just another ""Animal House""","Though the idea behind this is creative and thought provoking (dumbing down of America), it was filled with unnecessary and disgusting humor that obviously is meant to target adolescent males. All I can say is I giggled a few times, gasped a few times, and quickly gave this movie away to another unsuspecting soul."
1,worst movie ever,I should be able to sue Mike Judge and everyone involved in this film for the 90 minutes stolen from my life.
1,This movie made my brain hurt,"I only watched a few minutes during the middle part of this movie. I forced my boyfriend to change the channel because it was so terrible that I couldn't stand it anymore. I love my boyfriend and we've been dating for 2 1/2 years, but I really considered breaking up with him if he was going to make me endure anymore of this. Luckily for him, he turned the channel."
1,"Bad, real real bad...","Really? Honestly? If you have but one percent of a brain in your head, you'll stay away from this monstrosity. Horribly acted, horribly thought out and just plain horrible. I had hopes from the preview, but the preview fails to show the stupidity that is this movie. Perhpas the irony is lost on me. Perhaps this is just bad satire. I don't know, but what I do know is that the actors lost me as a fan for participating in such drivel."
1,Mindless entertainment with digital rites management (DRM) issues,"We rented this movie ""unboxed"" but found it was not young teen friendly and decided to wait till the next evening when the kids were in bed to watch it.Unboxed rental warning!When they say that you have 24 hours to watch it they mean it. We had less then 10 mins of the movie remaining when the 24 hours ran out and it was deleted right out from under us.It really should let you finish a movie if it is actively playing."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!,"Office Space is one of my favorite movies. But Idiocracy has to be one of the worst movies I have seen in a while. I mean seriously people, I would rather watch Kazaam than see this movie again. I dont know how the heck this movie has a 4 out of 5 star rating."
1,Horrible,"To misquote from Billy Madison...Mister Judge, this movie is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever watched. At no point in your rambling, incoherent movie were you even close to anything that could be considered a humorous or vaguely intelligible thought. Everyone who rents this movie is now dumber for having watched it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul."
3,"Ah, Fox","You'll never get me to say that this is a ""good"" movie, but it is definitely funny enough to justify watching. The prolonged introductory segment and the voice overs were simply not necessary, and only once contributed anything genuinely positive to the film (the whole ""I can talk to plants"" bit really would not have been as funny without the VO doing the explanation). I'll give Mike the benefit of the doubt and assume that most of its problems were caused by evil Fox executives rather than anything he did because it'll help me sleep at night. I'll never understand why they keep ordering more episodes of King of the Hill if they hate him so much that they can't even give him a stable timeslot."
2,A little too over-the-top to be funny.,"This move has been out for a few years, so i can't really add anything that hasn't already been said, but... I found the ""humor"" in this novel a little too juvenile. I liked the concept and there wasn't anything wrong with the acting, but this kind of silly corporate future has been done much better in movies like (albeit with much different plots) The 5th Element and The Running Man.It's very light entertainment best suited for a lazy Saturday night with popcorn in the living room. Insightful dark comedy, this is not."
2,IDIOCRACY,THE IQ BUCKET TEST WAS THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE. THE REST WAS IDIOT-CRACY. THIS IS JUST ANOTHER LOW-GRADE COMEDY.
3,SOME PARTS WERE FUNNY BUT WOULDN'T PAY FOR IT AGAIN,"I didn't buy this film as an educational documentary, I purchased it to laugh. The film did a pretty decent job at fulfilling my expectations. It provides an ironic insight into the potential direction of our country if we continue placing emphasis on the values, or lack of, that current society has adopted.The movie was good, but not great, and was quite cheesy at times. I am glad I saw it but will not be watching this one again and again."
5,The Future Looks ... Funny!,"Although funny, this movie does hit home on a lot of issues! A bit hokey at times, but still good fun. Hopefully, we won't stop drinking water LOL!!"
3,"Funny enough, but just barely","The idea behind Idiocracy (which is virtually the same as one C.M. Kornbluth used in ""The Marching Morons"" and ""The Little Black Bag"" in the 'fifties) would have been perfect for a TV comedy sketch, but is too thin for a full-length film, even one barely 90 minutes long. It has plenty of laugh-at-loud moments but never really gets off the ground. The suits at Fox may have known what they were doing by saving a few million by more or less dumping this film straight to DVD. If nothing else, the studio got plenty of free word-of-mouth publicity for the DVD version."
1,Yuck!,"I a word, STUPID. What little dialogue I heard was silly and unimaginative. The set up was also poor. I lasted about 20 minutes watching this movie."
2,Can't win them all,By the previews it looked like it was going to be better than it was. The movie is almost as dumb as the futuristic society portrayed. I'm glad I didn't spend very much.
3,Way to go South Carolina Public Education... wait a minute...,"I live in South Carolina. It's like a third world country in the USA. If you live anywhere else, save a little money, move there and live like a king. I think there's 3 Costcos in the entire state. There has been talk of building more for years, but so far nothing. The movie was funny,as well as, thought provoking. How far would our society have to go to be like the one in this distant future? Unfornately, not very far at all. Would watch again."
1,dont bother,I wish I had those minutes of my life back that I just wasted watching this movie. Poor choice on my part.
2,A subpar effort,"Unlike ""Office Space"", this offering from Mike Judge lacks the clever insight and sharp wit that we've come to expect. This sophomoric effort plays like it was made by some high school film students, complete with the safety net of too many lame sex jokes. This is one of those movies that is destined to go from DVD to repeated Comedy Central showings in about a month. I recommend you wait for it."
2,Interesting concept,"This movie is a litehearted fantasy depicting the ultimate result of the dumbing down of the human race. While the concept is fun, a more realistic prognostication would depict a small upper class of intellectual puppet masters directing a populace of stupid followers. Because I believe the subject is a real problem I had hoped for a more realistic presentation."
5,Americans against the obama invasion,This is a great movie. The first copy I bought was in 2007 and I thought it was a comedy. Unfortunately I found out in Nov 2008 this was basically predicting the future. Hopefully we can reverse course and remove the idiot from the white house this November. I am praying that we have less than 52.7 million idiots left in this country this time around and more than 200 million people woke up and see obama for what it is.
2,Stupid is as stupid does,"The premise seemed to implausable to be as it was described in the promotional information, so I was expecting some kind of ironic humor. Unfortunately, there was very little of either. This would have made a great ""magoo"" style cartoon (yeah, I'm old). It is good that some people actually found something to enjoy in this film. I couldn't. I gave it two stars because I'm polite."
2,Stupid Is As Stupid Does,"Wasn't it Forrest Gump who said that?The premise of this film is pretty cute: dumb people are reproducing at a more rapid rate than smart people, so they overwhelm the smarter folks 500 years from now. An present-day average person is thawed out and becomes the smartest one.Well, despite ""Talledega Nights,"" dumb jokes can only take you so far. After a while, this movie devolves into a standard digest of chase and save, and becomes a unconscious parody of itself.Some funny lines, some funny moments, but overall, it becomes tiresome."
1,Moronic production!,"Close to, if not the most stupid movie I have ever watched. I am disgusted and disappointed with myself for having sat through the entire movie. A complete waste of time and money!!!"
3,silly,"This movie was pretty dumb. I laughed as I felt mt own IQ drop a little, I watched it anyways."
3,Idiocracy and TV ads,"While watching ""Idiocracy"" I thought of comments friends had made about Super Bowl commercials and more recently political ads.The movie is an excellent example of friends' worst fears fast forwarded 400 years or so it seemed. Knee jerk was that ""Idiocracy"" was a very silly movie with well paid cast, but it later made me wonder about the advertisements that over the course of time affect the viewers.Awkward yet funny take on the ability to plan ahead seemed relatively small fry in the story.Funny way of putting it is that if you think it's silly now, just wait till you think about it! Good watch."
5,"Hilarious commentary on a very serious, depressing subject","Set in the future, this movie extends some current trends and speculates on how our society will look a few hundred years from now. If you feel like people are getting stupider... maybe it's not just you!! LOL"
5,Love this movie,"It's no academy award winner, but it's pretty darn funny. I guarantee if you watch it, that you'll think about it and refer to it for years to come. Definitely worth renting."
5,One of the Funniest Movies Ever,"I am a big Mike Judge fan, and this is my favorite of his work thus far. The lack of promotion Fox gave this fantastic movie is a crime. As long as you are not easily offended, this movie will make you laugh from beginning to end. As dumb as many of the characters are, this is not a dumb movie. Indeed, it is incisive satire at its best, and it is a scathing comment on modern American culture. If you liked ""Beavis and Butthead"" or ""King of the Hill"" or ""Office Space,"" then this movie is a must-see."
3,You Should See It... But It's Not Great,You should see this movie. It's not a great movie... but has an important message. It's a bad movie. It doesn't succeed in entertainment... but it does succeed in it's message.
2,Warning: Don't eat while watching,"I love Mike Judge's Office Space, which I also own, so ordered Idiocracy, sight unseen. My kids had just arrived for a visit the day it arrived, so I put it on. I made the mistake of trying to eat while watching..not recommended as I nearly choked. Luke Wilson makes a great ""normal guy"" foil and I'm a fan of Maya Rudolph from SNL. I kept belly-laughing for a week afterward. Like Beavis and Butthead, it's more a Juvenalian (way harsh) than Horatian (witty and kindly) satireOh, yeah; if you have younger children around you might want to wait until they're in bed before you watch it..unless, of course, you also let them watch South Park"
2,Movie is not that funny and not that thought provoking,"Office Space was a great movie, I bought this movie b/c I thought that it would be just as good, but I was wrong. I saw the trailer and the trailer was good but the trailer contained the best parts of the movie, the rest of the movie was not that great at all. I thought the movie was going to have some good meaning to it to get us all to evaluate our society and make it better but it failed at that. There are a few funny parts but definately not worth buying. I suggest that you rent this movie if you must see it. But if you expect it to be anything close to being as good as office space you will be greatly disappointed."
2,"""razor-sharp sarcasm""","Quoted from the synopsis on the dvd box. Technically, they weren't lying, since not all razors are sharp. Some are incredibly dull."
1,"Boring, long and not funny","This movie attempts to portray a future where everyone is stupid. I suppose the concept has some potential, but the execution is horrible.The plot is flimsy and drawn out and just seems to go on and on. It has many logical flaws that at a certain point become just too insulting to your intelligence to continue watching. For example, people in the future are portrayed as incredibly dumb, but they somehow manage to have televisions, cars and motorcycles, hospitals, Walmarts, a court system and a government.The humor is also very juvenile, with minimal cultural relevance. If you want to be entertained and come away not feeling like you just wasted two hours of your time, look elsewhere."
1,This movie makes a waste of time look good!,"I rented this movie for a friend who was staying with us. She told my wife that her close friend liked this movie. On her suggestion I rented the movie for all of us to watch. After ten minutes, the movie was so bad that our three cats walked out of the room and threatened to leave if they were forced to watch any more of it. We gave it another five minutes and all agreed that we should only show this movie to guests who you never see again."
1,Worst movie ever,"I stopped watching halfway through. It was just terrible. The concept was a good idea, but poorly executed. The only good part was the opening. Luke Wilson gets himself into some pretty stupid movies (also see: Home Fries)."
2,Huge dissappointment,"What did this movie lack that Mike Judge fans will be looking for? Great characters, great story, great script!With incredibly weak characters, and nothing to hang onto, story-wise, I kept waiting for something to gel. It never did. If you're a Mike Judge fan, you kind of have to see it, but you'll probably be unhappy with it.Some of the ""futurisms"" (Starbucks is a place where you can buy sex) are funny, but you can't make a film around that. Maya Rudolph is not pretty, likeable or useful in this movie."
4,Crass but SO True!,"I happen to see this on TV one time and missed the first 5 minutes. Didn't really make that much of difference and was feeling like it was such as stupid movie, but by the end I was laughing that it is a great movie. Some of the dialogue and pretty bad and some of the seances are gross, but I see that is what this world is coming to."
2,Disappointing,"Because I enjoyed ""Office Space"" I purchased ""Idiocracy"". The film has no style. The film does not create a real interest for the plight of the characters.I was so disappointed that it has no place in my dvd library."
3,Ehh..,"Had its funny parts definitely, made a few good points on the way society might be headed, wasn't to bad."
5,Hillarious and Sadly Evocative of What I See Around Me,"Sadly, this will resonate for reasons that may not be apparent the moment you watch it, but will come upon resoundingly as you interact with our world."
4,A Must See,"I believe this movie will become reality in my lifetime. With a no child left behind and a 10 point gradingscale in our schools, there is no doubt in my mind that policies like these will keep the bright students frombeing challenged and the kids that don't care will be rewarded."
2,Maybe a little too close to the truth.,"This movie was recommended to us by a learned man who said he hated it when he saw it the first time and then grew to appreciate it, but that it was a clever satirical look at what could happen if we continue to dumb down our kids generation after generation. Candidly, it scared me ... and depressed me. Not sure I'll be able to watch it again ... or to the point of being able to appreciate it's cleverness ... because it IS clever."
3,Better in theory,"There was a lot of potential as it seems like the film is a prediction of where our Jersey Shore, Honey Booboo watching culture is headed, but it could have been better. Still, a good effort."
2,Scary look into our future,"I got the point behind the movie and the thought of this being our great, great grand childrens future is horrifying. BUT this is not Luke Wilson best performance!!"
5,A Classic,This is a very funny movie. Great story line and flawless casting.This movie tells the amazing story of where our civilization is headed andwhat happens when we get there.
4,An Uncomfortably Relevant Social Mirror,"This is a dangerously funny movie with great relevance, for those who enjoy finding ""morals"" in movies.Warning: You might see your neighbors, friends or even your own family in this film!Strange this is not on Netflix and difficult to find in video rental stores, hence I purchased it.If Monsanto takes away all of our seeds and big-Ag grows all of our food, could we all become this stupid? I say yes. Answer for yourself."
5,Prophesy,"1984, Brave New World, &...Idiocracy. This movie is a satiric prophesy for our culture. Every time I watch this movie I see something else that reflects our current society. I laugh during the film then cry later. (Example: People named after popular product names--including Frito Mountain Dew.)Some of my favorites have major roles (Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph, and Dax Shepard) but my favorite faves are Terry Crews as President Macho Comacho and Justin Long as the ""doctor.""Hilarious."
5,The Future,Joe Bowers (Luke Wilson) is an average guy accidently frozen for 500 years as part of an US government cryogenic experiment that malfunctions. Bowers awakens in the year 2505 to find society so dumbed-down by mass commercialism that he is the smartest guy on the planet.Funny voice over narrative. Outrageous comedy that will make you think twice about the future of mankind.
4,"Dystopian comedy, not that far in the future!","Unfortunately, much of what this movie satirizes is already reality. It's not farfetched at all. Mike Judge has keen insights into American society which he showed with Beavis and Butthead, and he has honed his craft since then. I thought the monster truck rehabilitation scene went on too long, but the rest was great stuff. FOX took a beating; no wonder they wouldn't promote it. Cowards."
4,All around funny movie,"This is by no means the greatest movie ever made, but it has huge entertainment value. Creative concept full of hilarious moments. I personally had to look past a few of the more crude jokes, but with character names like Beef Supreme and Velvita Jones, you know you can't go wrong. If you're looking for a lightweight comedy with an interesting concept, this is definitely the movie for you."
5,Stupid Funny,"This movie makes me laugh and wonder if this is the fate of the world. It is one of those under rated undiscovered movies, kinda like Grandma's Boy. Favorite line ""Welcome to Costco, I love you""!"
3,"""I Like Money"" ~ A Bizarre And Frighteningly Insightful Satire On A Possible Future","`Idiocracy' released in '06 is an inventive, witty and incredibly funny look at life in the year 2505. See what possibly awaits mankind in the future when evolution throws the world a nasty, unexpected curve and the dumb inherit the Earth. This film is for all those anticipating a Utopia for the generations to follow. Beware, a crazy, up-side-down ""Jerry Springer"" society awaits.Don't laugh too much, there's more here to think about than you might suspect. My rating: 3 1/2 Stars."
1,Terrible Movie,"I understand the humor in this movie, and I get the plot. People are dumb. And this movie sucks."
1,Don't bother,"If you're thinking of renting this movie because you're curious to see just how stupid a movie can be, save yourself the trouble: it really is that bad. I managed 20 minutes before I hit fast forward followed very quickly by delete."
1,Nothing Like the Preview...,"This is a horrible movie. I like all kinds of comedy; I even appreciate good slapstick. However, this is not ""stupid funny,"" it's just stupid. I feel like an idiot for sitting through this entire movie and am sad that I wasted two hours of my life doing so. Don't wait for it to get better - it doesn't."
1,Stupid Is As Stupid Does,"The process of natural selection has selected superstitous behavior ad infinitum and Mike Judge has been infected. The problem is not human ""intelligence"" the problem is our idiot culture. Our idiot culture continues to shape superstituous behavior and until we understand the science of human behavior and how real world variables and the consequences of our experiences shape human behavior the cycle will never end. Mike Judge's continued perpetuation of ignorance isn't funny. There are six causes for human behavior:1. Genetic Endowment2. Pre-natal chemical environment3. Post-natal chemical environment4. Pavlovian Conditioning: stimulus-stimulus-response5. Skinnerian Conditioning: stimulus-response-consequence(natural selection)6. Traumatic factorsIf Mike Judge was not a hypocritical part of this idiot culture his film would have been funny. His conditioned ignorance makes this film not funny in the least."
3,Silly movie,The vendor did a fine job; no complaints there.I bought the movie on the recommendation of a friend. I laughed a bit but it was sort of corny in my opinion. I guess it was meant to be that way though. Probably won't watch it again. Not really my type of movie.
3,"Based on a true, future story...","I understand why Fox dumped it to DVD with only a limited release. In some ways, it is too high minded for the masses and frankly, they wouldn't get the fact that this is exactly where we are headed. In other ways, it is so infantile it is difficult to watch.Ultimately, it's not Office Space, but it deserves a viewing, if for no other reason than to keep you engaged in your kid's homework!"
3,Idiocracy,"There is alot of low class and adolescent humor here, but the story definitely strikes a cord with those of us who have made an effort to educate ourselves, plan our families, and advance our culture. It is a good,if humorous, look at how the other half lives."
1,"You Can't Play Dumb, Dumb",The great sin here is that the film makers didn't see the irony of making a movie as moronic as the society they tried to parody. Judging from most of the reviews here society may already be further gone than we feared.
2,Worse than I thought it would be,"I have heard good things about this movie, but it was a let-down. I like ""stupid-funny"" movies, but this was a little more ""stupid"" than ""funny."""
2,Good attempt but mostly misfire.,"A strong attempt at a satirical look at the sorry state of the current developed world. However, the humor is not good enough to carry the movie.This would've made a good 20 min skit or very short movie. I'm mostly sorry for having lost the time I spent watching it.I think the review by artanis65 is spot on, but more generous than my review."
3,"Stupid, yes. Funny, yes too.","I won't try to explain to you but this movie does have some funny parts and some good lines. ""He's guilty as &%#$ and we all know it"". Not sure if that is 100% the right quote but you get it. It's a rub on how ""smart"" people don't seem to reproduce while all the ""dumb"" ones do and after 500 years we're only left with the dummies. The funny thing is all the truisms in the movie."
2,Enough material for 20 minutes,"This movie is not ""a scathing satire"" about modern society. It has one point to make, and it does so in the opening two minutes (which are hilarious). The rest of the movie is predictable mayhem, with occasional smiles. It would have made a very clever short film, but as a full length feature it leaves you wishing you'd done something more constructive with your time."
3,Less a movie than I would expect from Luke Wilson,"Funny movie but less a movie than I would expect from Luke Wilson. The theme is right on the spot. Definitely population is getting dummer. They voted for Bush, the second time."
2,OK,"This movie was pretty funny towards the beginning, but it is basically a concept movie. If you like the concept, it's pretty much what you think it is going to be. However, as funnily as it began, it turned very moral at the end which always leaves me feeling that a movie was cheesier than it needed to be."
4,Funny movie,"The premise of this movie seems all to possible, the dumbing down of America. I've watched this movie at least 20 times and I can't get enough of it. Love the medical facility in this take on the future. It's a good light hearted comedy."
4,subtle in a odd way,I enjoyed this movie. The humor doesn't come from punchlines. The entertainment comes from watching the actors play their characters and the details of life in the idiotic future.
5,"Funny, but also sad view of America in the future","This movie is very funny, although not everyone will get all the humor. As funny as it is, the sad part is that this is a very accurate view into the future of America, and it won't take 500 years, if our educational system isn't drastically improved.I can't help but laugh every time the Costco scene comes on, because it seems like every few years big chains decide their new stores have to keep getting bigger and bigger, and you do almost need a tram system to get around them.President Kamacho is a prefect example of someone that is elected into office due to their celebrity status rather than actual job qualifications, but he is one funny President.Everyone in America should watch this movie, and really think about the message it is sending."
3,Idiocracy,Good premise and very funny at times. Just went on too long. But good for a quick watch on a weekend.
2,Boring and a little funny,"After hearing my friends talk about this movie I decided to watch it, maybe I expected too much but I thought it was boring. The comedy was luke warm at best. I would not rent it again or waste my time watching it even if it were free. Bummer"
2,Like the idea behind the movie,"The idea (dysgenics) behind the movie was interesting. However, I did not like the execution. Seemed to be written for a teenage boy."
4,Good LOL,"This is not a family film. Their is a lot of vulgarity. However, there are a LOT of LOL moments. Unfortunately you see a lot of things in this film that are ACTUALLY coming to pass. Sad commentary on our society - but FUNNY!!"
3,"After 500 years, Idiocracy still rules Washington","This lighthearted romp of a movie stretches the humor to new lows but in doing so it has a certain charm. Luke Wilson is good as the ""smartest person in the world"" and Maya Rudolph is cute as a street smart foil to him. What I loved about ""Idiocracy"" is that it reminds me of Washington today.....it's all a farce...the movie, and the real one, too!"
2,First 5 minutes are fun,"The rest of the movie does not innovate on the concepts presented in the first few minutes.I did go to the mall afterwards and realized the movie was about the present, not the future."
5,idiocracy,I have been telling people about this movie for years. I thought it was hilarious and pretty much sums up where this culture is heading. I saw it less of a commentary on corporations or government but more on how individuals are becoming less inspired to put any effort into anything of any worth...No one is forcing someone to shop at big box stores or eat junk all day and watch the tube it is a choice made by an individual .....
4,Some truth to this story!,"The meaning to this movie is somewhat based in reality, sad to say. Not the most well-done movie, but not the worst that I have seen either. Price paid was less than a rental, so can't complain a bit. Gave this a 4 star rating by mistake and couldn't change it to a 3 star. Sorry. . ."
5,brought to you by carls jr.,"i LOVE this movie! it's is stupid poo poo humor and political/social satire at it's best.the entire human population has de-volved into a race of idiots where slang and redneck talk have become proper english.the movie is funny, and is EXACTLY where the human race is going!this movie should not be taken seriously, and should be watched with friends. possibly drunk. we watched it 3 times in one week, and can't stop quoting it.""i love money!"""
4,satire nearly too close to reality,"I bought this DVD on the recommendation of a friend from Brazil, and I'm so glad I did! At first, when the average joe and the hooker come out of hibernatin and find themselves in 2505, it seems a little extreme. But as the film goes on and you begin to think a little more about it, the undeniable parallels with the world we live in today (especially the dumbed down, junk food-addicted populace) don't seem so far-fetched afterall. It is a wonderful, irreverant satire, and more frighteningly spot on than one likes to admit."
2,"interesting idea, sub-par execution","interesting concept, not that witty of an execution. Could have been much much better in execution and the acting was not very believable. Were moments when I laughed out loud."
3,I know some of these people . . .,"As much as I'd like to accept this movie as pure fiction, after watching it (twice), I found myself keeping an eye on people as I was shopping or just eating out. I got several laughs at their expense just picturing their bloodline in 500 years. If you don't take life too seriously and can appreciate ""stupid humor"", this movie will keep giving and giving . . .."
1,This movies made me throw up because it is bad,The worst film of all time. I quickly shreaded the DVD right after I watched it. I will never watch anything Luke Wilson is in any more. That was not a very wise career move for him.The movie title says it all.
1,Second worse movie I've ever seen,"The worst was ""Office Space"". Had I noticed the same people made ""Idiocracy"" I would certainly not have wasted my time watching it."
2,Too near reality.,"A very challenging movie to watch. I have always been a fan of Mike Judge's work, but this time I feel he just did not have the same charm to this film as he did with Office Space or Beavis and Butthead Do America. Idiocracy seemed way too over the top."
4,Mike Judge strikes again,"After seeing the movie on sale at Target i wondered why i never heard of it. After the success of office space i thought that Mike Judge would have some type of push in hollywood. But since hollywood is now full of high budget films, creators like Mike Judge are pushed to the bottom. The story of idiocracy is stright forward and although short keeps you interested throughout. The acting can be dull but overall does a fair job thanks to the great acting of Luke Wilson. The movie since it was low budget has poor visuals but has some what realism to what the future would be like if every one was an idiot. Overall idiocracy does a great job of making it, for me atleast, entertaining throughout. The movie should be considered for any comedy fan and a must for Mike Judge fans."
5,Funniest Movie you've never seen,This is a hillarious movie.I am constantly quoting it around the office.Buy it.
4,Sad but True (?),I saw this movie on Comedy Central...What a (hopefully exaggerated) view of American life in 500 years. Too Too Funny.
3,A cerebral comedy,"If you don't come away from this movie with the feeling that ""That's the way things are headed. Oh Dear Lord!"", you're not trying hard enough. It's like 1984, or Brave New World. Read up!Maya Rudolph is beautiful, there I said it. This movie was well-crafted all the way around, including the aggravating opening DVD interface. It tells the story!!"
2,Not very good,Movie was not very good. I do not recommend this movie to others. That is all I have to say
3,Eh.,Rented this because my husband wanted to watch it. Thought the main character was gonna change the world and make them all smart again but they all just stayed stupid. Disappointing. Jokes here and there but mostly I thought it was stupid funny versus being hilarious or anything like that.
3,I HAVE SEEN THE FUTURE AND IT SCARES ME TO DEATH!,This is a very funny satire and too close to what could be the truth for it's own good. Loaded with familiar faces this comedy held my interest from beginning to end. Which was a big surprise! Worth seeing for sure!
3,"Moronic, however...","it speaks to this generations commonsense, asking 'should we settle for this era to be summed up as unsulliedly painted to be pure imperfection.' The derangements from humane and intelligent pursuits are constantly defamed in all forms of media. The news glorifies murder. This film made my head ache at the first 1/2 hour of the movie because of its unrelenting stupidity. In the end, however, it brought everything that I know about this, my, time, to clear perspective. It is indeed highly probable that at the rate we are going, mankind might someday use a 'thirst-quencher' drink in its attempt for his crop to yield abundantly. God help us all!"
2,If you liked Office Space you wont like this,"I am a huge fan of Mike Judge! I loved Beavis and Butthead and Office Space was one of the greatest comedies in recent history. With that being said I thought Idiocracy would be hilarious. I was wrong!!! Yeah I laughed and chuckled, but I felt dumber after watching it. If movies like this continue to be made the world my just end up just like the world in Idiocracy."
3,Idiocracy mediocracy,"Idiocracy is the new comedy directed by Mike Judge, the voice and brain behind Beavis and Butthead, and the cult classic Office Space.The film stars Luke Wilson (The Royal Tennenbaums) as Joe Bauers. Joe is a regular guy, but not until he's chosen by the Pentagon as a guinea pig for a hiebernation program that, instead of going for a year, keeps him isolated along with a hooker named Rita, played by Maya Rudolph, for 500 years. When Joe wakes up, he finds a world overrun by morons, and becomes the smartest man in the world.The movie's plot is simplistic, and utterly idiotic as the movie implies. However, being a Mike Judge film, expect moments of hysterical laughter, but overall the movie passes as a mediocre effort.Mildly recommendedC"
1,Idiocracy,"It was a great concept borrowed from Woody Allen's Sleeper ( 1973) but not well executed. The Director expected the viewing audience to be as stupid as the general theme of the movie. It made no sense to use a hooker as the female protagonist. The updated concept is promising, but the execution was just terrible."
3,Not for kids,"A ""Tongue-in-cheek"" look at the future in a Dumbed Down World.Some funny parts but mostly predictable.Adult sexual themes and language....definetly not for kids."
1,Surprisingly Bad...,"I bought this movie not really knowing too much about it, trusting everyone that kept telling me how hilarious it was and that I needed to see it. Wow, this was shockingly bad. Like many have said, the basic premise is a great idea for a film and could have been hilarious, but after the first 15 minutes or so, it goes absolutely no where. Nothing but potty humor (fart jokes? seriously?), and dull acting. Avoid this one like the plague..."
1,Dumb and dumbest,"Aside from a couple of genuinely funny scenes this movie misfires throughout, and even the likeable Luke Wilson is unable to save it from the garbage heap. Maybe I just misplaced my inner juvenile but for me the satire is so lacking in subtlety that it's like being hit over the head with a jumbo bucket of fried chicken. I understand what Judge is trying to say about dumbing down, and for that he deserves credit, but this movie itself is so dumbed-down that it's self-parodic. Thinking about it, it's almost certain to become a cult hit."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"The concept was interesting, but this movie could have been done in a five minute Saturday Night Live skit. Yes, it's meant to be absurd and the movie succeeds in that matter. But how many stupid, grunting, swearing idiots do they have to throw at us to make their point? It's like listening to Beavis and Butthead for an hour and a half. By then end I was glassy-eyed and drooling."
1,"Wow, Horrible movie","I don't usually write reviews but when I saw this film as being one of the most downloaded unbox purchases I couldn't help myself. Someone told me that this was the next 'Office Space' -- if you're talking cultish following, maybe, but not nearly as good.In fact I would venture to say that this is probably one of the worst movie's i've ever seen. The premise is cool and and it's a good idea for a movie, but man, the execution is just not there.Highly UNrecommended"
1,not worth a rental even,This movie has a concept that will make you mildly chuckle. That's the first minute of the movie. The rest of the time you'll be sitting with a half-smile on your face waiting for something funny or interesting to happen. This half-smile will eventually turn into a look of disinterest and then the eye-rolling will start. It's a shame because I have a lot of respect for all the people who took part in it and have enjoyed their previous works.
1,I think Paris Hilton could have written a better script......,"Avoid this like the plague, yes the ""concept"" of the movie is great but the acting was on par with the ""Ernest goes to..."" movies.I also have to say I LOVED Office Space....this movie doesn't even come close. It's not worth renting or watching, RUN! Click on a different page for a different movie quickly!!!"
1,i want my stinkin 2.99 back,"If you want to waste your time watching the stupidest piece of ass film ever made, then this is your movie. idiocracy doesn't begin to describe Mike Judge's apparent descent into life as an imbecile. He used to write, right? He drank his own coolaid on this one. Really, couldn't stand it. Couldn't even get twenty minutes into it. Awful. Lame. Pathetic. Some of the cartoon effects are mildly amusing. I want my stinkin 2.99 back. Really."
1,"A for effort, E for execution",Not a single laugh in this whole movie. Brilliant premise but it falls so flat on so many levels. Acting is basically worse than B movie bad. The script is lame. I had high hopes for this after reading that it was some hidden gem that got overlooked when it came out. You can see why after watching it. Do not believe the hype. This is not a bust-a-gut sarcastic parody.
3,I'm really unsure just how to rate this,"I figure three stars is in the middle, so it won't scare anyone away, and you certainly shouldn't be reluctant to see this film. It has a powerful message, although one that's far too pessimistic, in my humble opinion. The production values on this one are pretty low, too. It seems like a film that was put together on a shoestring. But again, it works. The obvious slapstick and juvenile humor on the surface may be too corny for some. I found myself getting a little tired of the TV celebrity getting shots in the groin, for example. But peel away the surface layer and the underlying premise that the future of mankind will be left to the mediocre is intriguing and a little unsettling, even if it is more than just a little unrealistic."
4,Idiocracy,As a Comedy I got a few laughs out of Idiocracy the first time I watched it...I now view it as a documentary and its depressing..But still a must see. ;-)
3,"so-so movie, but I'm afraid it may be prophetic","The beginning sequence explains how complete morons have reproduced out of control, completely over-run even moderately intelligent people with their sheer numbers, and made this a world of mental midgets. It's frightening in is plausibility, though. The movie really isn't that great, but there are some nice moments. A couple of twentieth century people who would be considered of average intelligence at best by today's standards, played by Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph, end up getting frozen in a cryogenics program. Their pods get stored away and forgotten. They wake up in a far future where they are now the most intelligent people on the planet. The presidency looks more like the WWE than anything else, hospital and you can go to law school at CostCo. Again, it's not a great movie, but it's an interesting, and frightening, premise."
5,Hilarious,"I love this movie. Great visual humor and it's kind of scary because it could happen. The first time I saw it, I laughed non-stop, it gets funnier every time I watch."
4,Funny as hell... scarily true.,"This movie, done by Mike Judge (Office Space, Beavis & Butthead), is tremendously funny. The only problem is that this vision of our future is scarily accurate. I'm surprised that this movie doesn't get more attention.Luke Wilson plays a not-so-smart military man who participates in an experiment that leaves him frozen in time, waking in the 26th century. Commercialism and stupidity have taken over in the and Luke's character is now the smartest man alive. Simple common sense is called upon to save the day.Enjoy the humor and learn the lessons... Mike Judge did a great job on this one."
5,Iconic!,"Idiocracy fortells the future in a humorous, no, hilarious fashion. It should be required viewing for everyone. Smart people need to make more babies, or we are all doomed!"
4,social message,humorous social massage as a possibleexplanation of our present day exchangeof freedoms for beer and football.more people should see this film.
5,Great Gift for myself and for others,"I love this book. It has helped me a lot not only with my walking but with jogging, hiking and biking. I was a shallow breather with a lot of stress. This book helped me to relax which in turn helped me to go faster and farther. I use the imagery and positive self talk all the time when I am trying to overcome all the complaints in my head about exercising. This book makes a great gift for all the stressed out people in your life."
5,Great Walking Meditation,"This is a great book for anyone who would like to start meditating, but has trouble sitting still. I use the simple techniques when I'm hiking,and even biking. It gives my mind a break from all the unnecessary rehashing of problems or life stress. Now, after a workout, I feel much more refreshed from being in the moment and focusing on my breath and positive affirmations. I would recommend it to all levels of walkers and meditators."
3,Garaged punk,It's just another Murder City Devils record -- a dozen more sleazy tunes for those who liked the last 12.
1,Tired Seattle indie crap. <Yawn>,"Singer: whiny, out of key, shallow lyrics with uncreative vocal melodies.Rest of band: crappy equipment, bad tones, unimaginitive arrangements, poor mixing and engineering job, thoughtless.(why did they think the keyboards were a good idea?)For some reason the Seattle music scene thinks that making music as bad as possible is somehow an art statement. Let me tell you, this just sucks. Two years from now you will find this album in the $1 bin at your local used record store. No one will want it and everyone will wonder why on earth it was made."
5,Excellent Music - Quite Moving,My mom gave me tickets to this play after she had seen it twice in the space of 8 days. She knows my taste and was once again proved right. I loved the play and the music. I must take issue with the NY - 11/17 writer who said there was no plot. Maybe we didn't see the same play. The underlying theme was the struggle of talented teens held back due to apartheid. My sister also attended (for the 2nd time) the night I went. Her youngest child (6) and grandchild (3) were up and dancing in the aisles. To see them enjoy the play as much as I had was truly enjoyable. I am definitely planning on going back and encouraging as many of my friends and acquaintances as possible to attend as well.
5,Boomin Bass,"This Sony is by far the best shelf system Ive ever heard! The highs and mids are soo crisp, an acoustic guitar sounds like its right in the room next to you. The best feature on this system is the Subwoofer. This thing Kicks! The best thing to do is to put it on the floor, under a desk, facing TOWARDS the wall. This amplifies the bass. I would not recommend just setting the sub on a shelf facing out into the room, because you will not hear the full effect and power of this sub. I have this system connected to my laptop, T.V., and xbox. This system will deffinately be the best computer speakers youll ever have. I highly recommend this stereo to anyone who loves music, and any audio junkies like me out there. Dont even get me started on how good Drum and Bass sounds with this stereo..."
1,Very poor service for international customers,I can not recommend this company for international customers. They do not ship with tracking options. The shipping time to i.e Europe is 4-5 weeks. They are not capable of shipping to customers resident in countries not available in their country code choice list. Although they do advise a way of giving your address information if your country is not in their choice list they do not use this information. They did not react properly to information given by both telephone and e-mail. It was simply ignored!
5,Great memory,"Hi,I bought this ram for my sister son and i have over clocked the system from 2.4 to 2.7 @ 100% stable.i recommend this ram for overclocking."
4,Good set and quality.,Good set and quality for the price. It would be nice if the handles for the small sizes were a little larger. But it appears that mfgs of this type drivers make the handles small on small sizes.
4,They're Pretty Good,I purchased these ball head screwdrivers because I needed the smallest ones to work on R/C helicopters. They held up well but I eventually rounded off the heads of the smallest two. Bondhus has a lifetime warranty but I have not mailed them in to be replaced because I haven't used them much lately. I was hard on these tools and they still held up fairly well. It is hard to find extremely small hex head tool that don't round eventually. These were some of the best I have tried.
4,"quality item, well priced","Nice set for the price, ball drivers are great for working in tight spaces.The ones I'm using to drive 3mm and smaller socket head metric bolts are a little smaller than I'd hoped, but work fine."
4,"Good drivers, Great value for money","So far these drivers have been great, they seem to be very well made, accurate and mostly comfortable. As other reviewers have mentioned, the handles of the smaller sized drivers are small for adult hands. I see this as both a pro and a con - it is a little less comfortable using them but I think it also limits the amount of force/torque I can drive which is a good thing for smaller screws, and so far I haven't found a small screw I could not open with these drivers.Bottom line, I definitely recommend them especially for the price they are sold at, (At the time I bought these, I could not find another good set at the same price range)I also own the similar standard sized (Inch) setBondhus 10632 Set of 8 Balldriver Screwdrivers, ProGuard Finish, sizes .050-5/32-Inch, you will find the same review there :)"
3,good for this type of subject,The story is good and the writing is great like all of Laras' works but i'm just not into this suject matter - I like a little more Paranormal in my reading
3,Just didn't seem to deliver,"I guess I was just expecting a lot more from this book after reading the reviews, but I have to admit that it left me a little disappointed. The charachters just didn't seem to hold my interest. Raina seemed to be too whiny and spoiled and Gunnar just encouraged this throughout most of the book. It also seemed incredible that Raina had no idea of her father's true charachter and that he,himself, was able to conceal his dark side for all of those years before the truth was finally discovered. On the positive side, I do believe that Ms St. John has a great deal of talent and I will probably buy her next novel. I also believe that she has a lot of talent and a great future as a romance writer."
2,Great book,"I would give this book five stars! I wasn't able to change the review stars on my kindle. Anyway, I like how Raina in a way has a sort of loyal to both her dad and Gunnar. This book kind of reminds me of Beauty and the Beast, because Belle in the movie is the prisoner sort of and the Beast think he isn't good enough for. Beast falls in love because she calms him and Belle looks beyond to what there is on the outside. I definitely recommend reading this book:]"
2,lord of vengeance,didn't do it for me. It's the first of Lara's book that I did not like. Was a little boring.
3,it has it's moments,It had some good and funny moments in it. Some were kind of blah. but overall the book was ok.
5,sexy page turner,"Fantastic medieval read. Sizzling, heartwarming. Will be reading this one again. The author brings history alive. sexy and a page turner."
3,Very entertaining,Good read. Plot progression was good. Hero was developed with interest. Heroine was a little soft and naive for my taste.
4,great,"As an editor it takes a lot to please me, but You, Ms. Adrian, have definitely given me a few hours of pleasurable reading. I love that you stick to the medieval words and way of speech, but not too much that one couldn't decipher it. The typos were minimal, which was a relief. One thing disturbed me, that he allows her back to fall into Nigel's clutched. I feel he should have at least thought about it or been a little concerned. There was a shadow of Kathleen Woodiwiss' novel, The Wolf and the Dove, in your book, But having said that, the story was your own. Those two things aside, an excellent novel, well done."
4,A very sweet story.,"I enjoyed the book, but found some of the scenes contrived and difficult to believe. St. John's attempts at sexual tension are slightly amusing, but succumb to a lack of emotion. However, she unfolds her story masterfully and the ending is worth reading the rest of the book - it will reduce you to tears. That's why I gave it the 4 stars. You truly 'feel' the characters and you accompany them every step of the way."
2,Disappointed.,"Despite the positive reviews, this book was not to my taste.I usually finish reading books (historical romance) of this volume in 2~3 days. When I finished reading half way through, I just put it aside, and a few days later, read the last chapter and tossed it. I liked the heroine at the beginning, but I thought her innocence (personality wise) was written too ""corny"" and got tired of reading. Like Nigel was shallow, coward and irritating to extreme, heroine was nice and innocent to extreme, which resulted in making her sound too ""coquettish"" to me. Annoyingly coquettish Raina, Oh-so-extremely-manly Gunnar, way too foolish Nigel... I mean, it's like watching a cheap action movie, you know exactly how it ends, and you can just fast forward to make sure that your guess is right.Recently read Johanna Lindsey's viking family trilogy - The best read ever.I am glad this piece was only $0.99."
3,Adequate Romance Quick Read,"I have not read any of Adrian's other novels, so I cannot compare this to her other works. Lord of Vengeance is a decent read, but not what I would consider award-nominating quality. At times I found the story predictable, and at other times silly. I couldn't quite get into it enough to find it believable. If you a looking for a light quick read worth the 99 cents I paid, then this is your book. If you are looking for something new, or something that will truly engross you and make you wish for more, the look elsewhere."
4,Lord of Vengeance,"I enjoyed the the book, and have read all of Lara Adrian's books. I like the setting...England, 1140, and this book has a bit more plot than some, in that the reader is taken from events of the past to how people are formed in the now. There is quite a bit of emotion in the characters as they except truths in their lives. The one thing I did not care for is the pages and pages and pages of explicit sex. It seems to be the fad these days to fill in the plot with sex scenes you would get out of Playboy, and it is not only NOT the way these people lived, it is boring for the reader......I usually just skip over these parts to get back to the story."
3,Ignore the cheesy cover,"This is a pretty good story, especially considering the low price of the download. Female MC is spunky though not as kick-ass as I like in my books, but hey, this is set in medieval times so perhaps that would be asking a bit much. I am glad I read it. If you liked this book you might like Master of Crows."
5,I was hesitate at first..... But holy cow!,"This book is soooooo good. I didn't expect much from this book. Boy, I was very wrong. It was such an amazing experience. I really enjoyed this book. READ IT!"
4,great read,I really liked this book. The story is well developed as well as the characters are very lively and believably described. They come to know each other progressively through the story and learn to accept their flaws. Both fight for their love to succed and for their future.
4,Love conquers,"Well written. The story is well paced, coming to understand the characters involving. You could feel their frustrations, hope, and strengths and happy that through all, they were rewarded for their faith in one another."
5,Fantastic Romance Writer,"I have read all the books in Lara Adrian's Midnight Breed series and couldn't put them down. Now I have discovered that she penned stories such as Lord of Vengeance under the pseudonym Tina St. John and has re-released them. I love historical fiction and combined with romance and Adrian's excellent story development, make these books a must read. I am eager to read more of her books!"
3,a decent story,"It had all the right elements. Guy out for vengeance falls in love with enemies daughter, but... I don't know. It lacked a certain something. The hero was so caught up in the past and his hatred it got tedious."
4,Loved it!,"This was a great book! I finished it in less than 24 hours -- couldn't put it down. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I would have liked to see more at the end -- what their life was like after all of the drama. Some historical romances I've recently read have a very long Epilogue following up on the lives of the characters after the book ""ends"" and I would have loved to see that here. Still, a wonderful book and I very well may read it again. :)"
4,A good book,"This was a good story,not page turning suspense but a good plot. She has a way of drawing a reader into the story."
5,Loved the story,Raina and Gunnar story was amazing and her loyalty to him and not own father was so touching. Love the book a great recommend a great read.
3,Quite predictable,"I enjoyed this book. The protagonists were like able and the villain was villainous. That being written, it was very predictable. Boy meets girl. Girl instantly is attracted to him. But boy is scarred and she manages to heal him with love (figuratively and literally). Oh they defeat the villain. The end. I just told you the whole story in 50 words or less.I gave it 3 stars because it was well written and well edited."
5,"Dark villains, a damsel in distress and a knight for a hero....","It doesn't get better than this in the era of medieval romance! A truly unique plot with lots of twists and turns. A dark and brooding hero who's heart is tamed in the end. A heroine who is strong but not too strong. A story that is beautifully written, fast paced and thoroughly interesting. I highly recommend this one!"
5,Very Enjoyable,Really enjoyed reading this book. It was a nice surprise to find some of Lara's earlier written books. I definitely give it a thumbs up.
5,Loved this book!,"I thoroughly enjoyed the story of Gunnar and Raina. Gunnar was such a gentleman, he wanted her but he didn't force her. Raina, though young, was a strong character as well. She didn't whine, she wasn't spoiled and she wasn't irritating. No wonder Gunnar developed feelings for her. I actually enjoyed the banter between the two. I found Gunnar's words, when he did tell Raina how he felt, so romantic. I found this story quite good and will definitely look up this author's other books."
4,MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE,This is the first book I've read by Ms. St. John and it was a good one. More than just your typical hero rescues heroine story. This one has heart and delves into the idea of forgiveness and getting on with your life. Good story. Try ONCE A WARRIOR by Karyn Monk if you liked this one.
5,Prepare to fall in love...,"LORD OF VENGEANCE is a colorful tale of medieval pageantry that centers around a knight driven by his hunger for vengeance and the beautiful innocent who reclaims his soul from the grip of hatred; who teaches him to feel again, and to love.Beautiful, memorable, with a fresh, lyrical voice and vivid imagery. The plot whizzes along with an edge-of-your-seat suspense subplot featuring one of the most cunningly wicked villains I've seen in a long time. A powerful debut, and I for one am anxiously awaiting LADY OF VALOR..."
1,Never got this item,We ordered this cooler a year ago and they kept saying it was on back order. Well.......how far back.
5,A brilliant work,"Can't say enough about this book. The subject's life is truly epic, spanning the Russian Revolution, World War II and the cold war. Thomas is right when he says that if you judge a writer by how he affects history, Solzhenitsyn is the greatest writer of our century. Plus his life is riveting. I loved this biography as much as any I've read since Robert Caro's wonderful LBJ Volume One. It's neat to have a novelist doing a biography too, as that seems to add a dimension here. Anyway, this is a brilliant work about a riveting subject. Can't say enough about it."
5,best album of them all,the album was awesome.sometimes i listen to it while i sleep.i love watch my shoes and it should be on the top 200 list.if you like music.then you should buy this album.
5,The best,"Trill ent. is Dope! Webbie, Boosie, Foxx, Big Head and 3 deep. All from Baton Rouge, La all real all dope. So that would make this cd Dope!"
2,"a few tidbits, but a bit scattered and poorly edited","This was pretty much what I expected from a self-published book. I learned a few things. It's not clear who the intended audience is, because it variously addresses gymnasts, parents, and coaches. Readers looking for a thorough and well-polished reference will be disappointed."
2,"it works, but...","It works, but it really can't be worn attached to your jacket for easy access. It has to be held in your hand to read it, so it isn't really practical when you are using it for hunting. It will now be used as a ""back up"". Also, when it arrived I noticed a big glob of what looked like glue inside the glass. It just looked cheap."
4,"Durable, accurate and compact","I've recently started putting a survival pack and supplies together. While going down the list of things I need to get, I debated whether to get a new high-tech compass or not. I decided not to. I've had the Brunton clip-on compass for nearly twenty years now and have taken it on all of my travels: England, New Zealand, Australia. I tied a lanyard to the hinge so as to wear it around my neck as the belt clip is pretty flimsy and doesn't have enough grab for it to stay on. It may not have any special functions, but if you're looking for a compass that will give you good north-south orientation, this will do the job. I'll probably get a smaller one just for back-up, but this one is still as accurate as ever."
4,WTour PA3 Yamaha Power Cord,"I am so delighted to save $ on the purchase of 8 size D batteries, first of all.However, i have only one concern which is small in comparisonto the convienences of DC;this would be that the attachment isunfortunately loose fitting thus if for some reason the cordis disturbed the power will be abruptly cut off. Evenso i still saypurchase and enjoy esp. since it seem to be hard to find locallyfor this old piano of mines. Moreover the cost is simply affordable."
5,It has a lof of my favorite classical artists.,"I gave this to my mom-n-law for Chrstmas and she loved it. I got it because I saw that it had the best of the best. Debussy, Erik Satie, and a lot of others that are so glorious but I'd hate to even attempt to spell their names. It has over 6 hrs and it came quickly and in mint condition. I am very pleased especially since it was so inexpensive. It's amazing that you can find the best music for less."
2,Good value but don't buy to rip,If you intend to simply play the CDs and get composer and title from the box this is a good value. If you intend to rip this to a digital format like wma or mp3 don't buy it unless you are prepared to re-type all the meta data. Meta data like composer and title is incomplete and or inaccurate.
1,Totally dead after one charge,"Charged once with the same charger I use for the standard Sony battery that still charges fine. On battery power indicator doesn't work or show power level and when I attach the battery to my Sony HDR HC1 it powers up and then the Camcorder LCD says ""Use InfoLithium Battery"" and then shuts down. Nothing wrong the camcorder - it still works fine with the original Sony battery."
2,Very poor quality printing and paper.,Very poor quality printing and paper. It reminded me of the pirated books I had noticed in Asia!
1,Realistic Racing,"Well personally I havent got a new NASCAR game since 2005. There's no realistic flips, and you have complete control of your car when you spin out, damage is just rigid graphics with black paint. On Fight to the Top mode you can't join a actual race team. Also if there's a wreck the whole field stops on a dime at 186 mph and the car won't stop like that for me, real life cars keep goin' and can only slow and avoid not stop and wait. Anyone Agree? Also that share draft thing that pops up above the cars annoys me terribly. NASCAR 98 was funner then these games."
5,Fun Game,I enjoyed this game. It was a lot of fun. The game looks better than last year. There is this cool blur effect that makes the game look very fast. The driving controls are much better than last year. And all the driver's have ratings now. It's about time. Now I can take advantage of Tony Stewart's road course expertise. I recommend this game.
3,Nascar 07,"I bought the game for my brother for xmas and he seems to enjoy it. However, Amazon never notified me that the game would be better played with a steering wheel."
4,Great resource,"I purchased this book for a construction class and as an architecture student, I find it very helpful. The book is not a construction how-to and the images are not very detailed nor are any of the images in color, but it is a compilation of a variety of architectural examples that use different or innovative construction methods. A great supplement to a studio course for inspiration and incorporating interesting structure into projects."
3,"good book, bad print","This great and useful book is printed so badly, that makes wanto to write to the authors and Birkhauser to ask for your money back. It is basically a low def scan. Anything that is not a line drawing is plainly illegible."
3,Bad Printing,"As someone already mentioned, it is a good book but, the print quality is bad. In a book store in Spain, I saw the same book. It was a lot better in quality of paper and print resolution. The version I received through Amazon in the US is printed in the US and, unfortunately, a lot of details are lost because of low resolution of printing. Whatever the reason is, it is bad. The book is very well written. The publisher should print better using better quality of paper. It is a shame."
4,BEERY BOOM BOOM,"This is no ""Scarface"", but ""The Big House"" is one 1930s classic you want to own! Cons stage a massive prison break(where did they get all those cool Tommy sub-machine guns?), and choose for their leader none other than Academy Award winning Wallace Beery. In one big scene, you can't see the actors for all the gunfire and smoke. In 1934, Beery created the immortal Long John Silver in Treasure Island. ""Big House"" also stars one of my favorite actors, Chester (Boston Blackie) Morris. This is true Black-and-White heaven!"
5,Surprisingly Good,"An unusual film from MGM, featuring a grim look to the harsh reality of prison conditions. Being an early talkie (1930), the first thing to surprise me favorably, was that the camera wasn't static at all, on the contrary there is as lot of camera movement indeed, showing lots of eye-catching angles of life in prison, especially of that big dining hall.On the other hand, the pacing and the acting are both first rate, Chester Morris steals the film with his convincing performance of a forger finally finding the reason (love, what else?) for goin' straight; Wallace Beery gives another of those tough-guy performances (who after all, has a big heart hidden deep inside) he excelled at; and then newcomer, Robert Montgomery, is good as weak young lad, locked-in because of mansalughter.A real discovery! Ought to look for more early talkies featuring this great tough-guy, forgotten actor, Chester MorrisWatch it!!!"
1,Plastic transmission broke after 4 weeks of light use,"Title says it all. Overall it was not a totally bad design, but the outlet on the bottom of the can was hard to clean and when the poor transmission broke, we even didn' bother to get it repaired."
1,Useless as delivered,"The screw will not tighten onto the mandrill sufficiently to lock the cutting wheel in place; I have used other diamond cutting wheels (purchased from American Science & Surplus, who have not paid me for that bit of shilling) and never had a bit of trouble. Fie on me for going for a slightly lower price."
3,"Good for grinding, not for cutting","My experience is rather different than the other reviewers - I dont know why. I have found that the grit is only on the faces, not the edges. For me, these wheels basically dont cut, but they do a great job of grinding. I have tried to use them to cut metal and plastic. They have failed to cut aluminum, steel, and stainless steel, plate and screws. On plastic, they melt the plastic more than cutting it (which, in the end, does work.) I have found the dremel cut-off wheel to be much more effective. after cutting metal or plastic with the demel cut-off wheel, these wheels do a great job at grinding the edges smooth or grinding away additional material.Sooo.... I give them 3 stars because they are good for grinding, but I wanted them for cutting."
4,Good Price - Good Pack,"You have to have some synth-dia-mond ies in the collection, don't you?Of course you do.These are pretty much mandatory for the accessory collection.Nice price too. Very happy customer over here."
5,Normal size disk,"I work withed a Dremel product up until just last month, when I got a Proxxon which I love. These diamond disks look great. I have not used them yet but can see the advantage of the cooling holes placed in the disk. They are very very thin which will help in my model endeavors in War-Hammer cutting plastic, wood and their soft metal figures."
4,"Only decent, but very cost-effective","I've been using these to cut some thin carbon-fiber/epoxy composite, and they work just fine. I do have a word of warning to anyone who needs precision in their work, however: these are not made to tight tolerances - the hole for the spindle screw is off center in many of the discs. I'm just using it as a cutoff tool, so it doesn't matter to me - it might to you. As a cutoff tool, it's a fantastic deal."
5,A steal!,"I bought these almost a year and a half ago, and JUST needed to order a new set. Now granted I only use these now and then, but at this price I am mighty glad that I am spending five bucks every year and a half instead of fifteen bucks every three months!These fit just fine in a dremel as well as in my (slightly narrower) black and decker multitool, and seem to cut just as well as the name brands!The wheels are indispensable for cutting thing sheet metal - I mostly use them for modding computer cases and they have even done a decent job on the outside of Apple's Powermac G5 with its reinforced aluminum! One of the wheels wore down at the center where you screw it down to secure it. I don't know if I did it incorrectly, but one out of six is definitely not bad!I still can't believe how inexpensive these are, and can't recommend them highly enough!"
1,Eccentric rod,"Grinding wheel quality is okay, but the stick is eccentric, can not be used, is simply a waste, a waste of money and time."
4,Inexpensive alternative,"Bought to have a backup for a Dremel diamond wheel that cost twice the price for one disk.Perform as well out of the box.Haven't been able to put a lot of miles on yet, but look sturdy enough as long as you don't overheat (per other reviews).Worth adding to your toolkit."
1,Poor Mandrel,"I am somewhat torn about how to rate this set. The wheels seem to be of decent quality. I was able to cut two 8X10 mirrors from a large panel with one wheel. The problem and the reason I gave this product a poor rating is because the mandrel stripped completely just as I finished cutting the second mirror. This was not operator error as I know the mandrel was tight before beginning to cut. As I said above though, the wheels are good quality, the mandrel, not so much. It may be possible to use these wheels with a standard Dremel sanding disc mandrel. I haven't tried that yet but at least I would still be able to use the wheels."
4,I WILL NEED MORE WHEELS NOW....,I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT. I AM A WIRE-JEWELRY ARTIST WHO WANTED TO EXPERIMENT WITH NEW THINGS. I BOUGHT SOME DIAMOND BITS AND STARTED TO CARVE ON GLASS AND SEMI-PREIOUS GEMSTONES! THIS CUTTING WHEELS ARE INCREDIBLE! THEY CUT EASILY THRU GLASS AND MOST SEMI-PRECIOUS STONES. I HAVE CREATED MANY NEW DESIGNS..THE PRICE AND SHIPPING IS INCREDIBLE! I WILL DEFINITELY GET MORE CUTTING WHEELS SOON.... I JUST WISHED THEY WILL LAST LONGER....BUT THE GOOD THING IS THAT THERE ARE 5 CUTTING WHEELS ON THIS KIT!
2,USELESS,the small screw used to tighten the blade to the shank is flimsy and breaks easy. GO With a real blade and shank not the screw type.
1,DEFECTIVE!,HAVE YET TO USE THE ITEM IN THAT IT WAS DEFECTIVE WHEN I OPENED THE PACKAGE. THE SET SCEW SECURING THE BLADES WAS STRIPPED OR DEFECTIVE WHEN I OPENED THE PACKAGE. BUT IT LOOKED REAL GOOD IN THE PACKAGE.
3,Hopeful they'll be of use someday.,"Bought these to cut some holes in porcelain tile, but just not quite durable enough for the 3/8 tile I had. They did okay, but ended up going with a hole saw for a cleaner cut and a lot less work."
3,broken screw and loose mandrel,"the blades seem great! I was trying to cut a bit of rock with the composite cut off wheels and the rock (Mica schist) just ate up those bits. this blade cut through it almost easily. the only problem I had was the discs kept on slipping.to explain, the mandrel has two small rubber-ish washers that the blade is sandwiched between, and I figured that was a good thing, protect the blade from over tightening. well, they seem to keep me from getting the screw tight enough, and when trying to tighten the screw down today, the screw sheared off.I'm going to try to use the wheels in my regular mandrel for the other cut off wheels, and without the two washers to see if that works better, I don't intend to get right on that, i'll post later if it works."
3,use on glass,haven't really had a chance to use them very much but they seem to do an ok job cutting glass.
4,Intense,"i was so lucky as to be in a version of this play at my school. i was the drummer. this is the most intense thing to watch, to be a part of or anything. each time we performed it i got so caught up in everything that i felt that it was really happending and i was just so moved. i greatly encourage anyone and everyone to read and/or see this play it is just great."
1,Country - sickness,"This is a compliation of a a lot of great country songs. Too bad it isn't done by the original artists. No where does it state that the songs are originals, but the assumption is there. Well you know what they say about assuming. . .my mistake. I would like to get my money back."
3,Batman and Robin,"This was my first read of Davis' and his crime busters and I don't think I will read another. Ditto on the editing and proofreading, worst I've seen too. Three times characters were misnamed and easily spotted.I found it hard to swallow that a week's worth or more of investigating and interviewing was done by 10:30 a.m. With the 8 P.M. deadline pushing them they got more done and more running around than anyone could accomplish in a traffic jammed area and only used a helicopter once I believe.I also thought Collin's growing awareness of Amanda a bit pre-teenish."
4,"3 1/2 Stars -- A Good, Fast, Entertaining Read...But!","A Long Day For Dying is a perfect book to read on the beach or on a plane trip. It's very plot-driven, fast-paced and exciting. However, you really must be willing to stretch your ability to suspend belief, as the plot is somewhat far-fetched. Also, the book is a little thin on character development. While I enjoyed Davis' latest, it's not a book that will make you feel that you have to rush out and buy his other books. It's fast entertainment that will make you want to ""turn the pages,"" but it's also the type of book that you'll forget about soon after finishing it."
3,If you like military/ thrillers...,"like, Nelson Demille, Brian Haig, etc. you will like this book. It's not his best though. I would read The General first."
3,WANTED MORE,"Love love LOVE 'Tasha B's music and I have 3 of her cd's but I thought this dvd was boring and a bit amateur-ish, she is a super star and an awesome vocalist no doubt, but I guess I wanted the dvd to be more special, possibly different arrangements on some of her songs, more visual effects etc., anything that could be considered ""extras"" that didn't make me feel like I was literally watching a live performance of her cd. I would have just bought a live cd of hers instead of getting the dvd if I knew this would be the case.Still love her music though!"
4,All of Heep .. maybe too much,"A good song selection and according to the reviewers, well remastered and carefully placed in the right order. However, it should be noted that like Genesis and Deep Purple, Heeps career was divided by a change of singers. Also, Ken Hensley, the driving force behind the best Heep songs, left somewhere in the late seventies. This virtually put the band in the hands of remaining founder member Mick Box.Almost all of disc 2 is about Heep after David Byron and the material is not half as strong as before. If that is no objection to you, this is a good overview of a band that managed to survive for more than forty years - an admirable achievement!If you prefer the music Heep produced in the Byron/Hensley years, get Classic Heep."
3,Not quite as good as previous compilation because...,"I love Uriah Heep (even the newer version - I'll be attending their upcoming Atlanta show) and saw them a lot back in the day. My favorite Heep song has always been ""Bird of Prey"". Why, then, is the version on this CD not the original? It's pretty bad, with the vocals sounding like Mrs. Miller channelling Tiny Tim. I was pretty shocked when it came across my speakers, considering how good everything else sounds. Did they lose the original master, or was it destroyed? Anyway, you'd be better off getting ""Classic Heep"", where all versions are intact."
4,"Quo's"" Don't Stop"" apt after 30 years of hits","When Status Quo celebrated their 30th anniversary in 1995,they decided to pay tribute to some of their favorite rock songs of the past.The opening track,""Fun,Fun,Fun"" is a slightly different version from The Beach Boys yet still a foot stomper.The Beach Boys actually help out on the record and it's a great mix.Other great tunes include a MUCH better version of Creedence's ""Proud Mary"",and a killer version of""The Safety Dance"" done by Men Without Hats in'83.The title track is,of course,a remake of Fleetwood Mac's 1977 hit and is also excellant.""Get Back"" is also a rouser from the Beatles.""Get Out of Denver"" puts Bob Seger's version to shame.There are 2-3 songs that are only fair,but overall,this is an outstanding remake of great tunes."
5,Izaline Calister,"First time I heard Izaline Calister was when I was back on my island of Aruba at a dance recital in the summer of 2002. It's unbelievable how the song, which was a tumba, just took me by surprise giving a local rythm a taste of jazz plus the fine classic touch. Even though the songs are in Papiamento which is the local language of Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao. The music will attract anyone who loves jazz. I did not know from who it was until this summer ""Wowi Carinjo"" became one of the biggest hit on the island of Aruba. If you're looking for some good Caribbean jazz music this is the CD to buy. This CD was a must have in my collection. Izaline Calister has an angelic voice expressing through emotions. Great work!!"
2,Smoothie Elite,This stopped working after about 8 weeks of use. We made about 6 smoothies a week--not good for a lot of use!
2,Not an everyday blender,"Stopped functioning after about 6 weeks of operation. We made about 4 smoothies a week. Would probably be ok for someone who was the occassional smoother, but obviously not us.Cleaning was ok, but the spout really isn't a useful feature in my opinion, as you have to pour to get all the blended material out anyways and you end up wasting the material that gets stuck in the spout. Plus, it's one more thing to clean...Went for the Oster 2-speed beehive instead, per the positive reviews."
2,Not very interesting,"I usually like Baxter Black, but he was very bad on this video. He poorly read his script and had no emotion in his presentation. The ""video"" was nothing more than a lot of still pictures of places. It could have been a much better presentation. It felt like a very old way of showing a subject. Do not waste your money on this one."
4,"Yep, concur...","...with various reviews stating -Great material/renditions. Well worth having, especially since nearly-new copies available for a couple of bucks.And absolutely concur on docking a star due to shoulda been a double CD. Particularly with emphasis on Aja material (not that this is bad thing, but there are so many tracks - hits and deeper cuts - that could have been on here, and with several tracks of a pretty short list being from Aja, well there you go)."
5,"VERY,VERY GOOD CD FOR NEWER STEELY DAN FANS.","If you're a newer Steely Dan fan like myself, you will love this CD. It has all their songs that ""everybody has heard, but nobody knows who did them"" on it. The more contemporary sound to their old classics really makes them sound like a session band. Oh, and by the way, Bernard Purdie DOES NOT play drum kit on this CD like Nancy Kobryn said(a reviewer from above this one), DENNIS CHAMBERS PLAYS DRUM KIT! For those of you who don't know who Dennis Chambers is, he is only THE greatest contemporary funk and fusion drummer alive, which is, in my opinon, the icing on the cake for this CD. Listen to Josie and you will know what I mean."
4,BIGDANFAN,Read the reviews some not so great.They were wrong. Great album. The guitar solo on Peg one of the best.I think even better than Larry Carlton on Kid Charlemane from the Royal Scam album.Also usually not a big drum fan but the drums on the album really nice.
3,Hard to believe that such sophisticated music was popular,"College students used to listen to this music in the '70s. It is jazzy and complicated, for pop music. It was all part of the cynical reaction to 60s idealism (""Only A Fool Would Say That"", as one early song said) There's a fair number of hits on this release. The band is first-rate, with no less than former Weather Report drummer Peter Erskine on about a third of the numbers. If you're a Steely Dan fan, then you can already guess how this album sounds. The only surprise is ""Book of Liars"", featuring a vocal by Walter Becker. The liner notes, presumably by Fagen, are fun, especially a satire of the poem ""Howl"" about life on the road. An unremarkable but enjoyable souvenir of what may be Dan's last go-around."
2,steely dan is euphoria but this cd is awful,Don't waste your money on a mediocre live album when there are so many better ones. Everyone who reads this should buy Royal Scam at once.
2,Very Average&Predictable,as Much As I Dig Steely Dan&Their Genius The Live thing just doesn't cut it.The arrangements&Music don't add nothing to the music.Just stick to the Albums.
2,meh,shocking (bad) sound for steely dan. Chambers OK; Erskine would've been better. Fans will like; I guess.
2,Predictable and Irrelevant,"Given that Steely Dan was primarily a studio creation of reclusive geniuses Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, did anyone honestly expect a live Steely Dan to gain anything on stage? This ""live"" record is sterile and lifeless, the arrangements differ so imperceptably from their album counterparts, that this record becomes cynical by its very exisitence. The studio versions of everything on ""Alive in America"" outshine this disc's surpirsing sterile performances, making this one for the diehards only."
3,They were better than this live.,"In 1994, before I had a CD player of my own, a bootleg live CD of Steely Dan's then current tour showed up at the local music store, which i listened to at the store. The opening number was a very cool jazz influenced intstrumental medley of some of the Dan's jazzier tunes. It was absolutely incredible! The rest of the CD, although lacking in top notch recording quality, nevertheless was filled with creativity and energy. I was very excited when I heard that this live CD was being released by the group, and I've never been so disappointed in my life! Compared to what I heard, this sounds lethargic and tired. I don't know who chose the tapes to release for this album, but they definitely chose the wrong ones."
2,huge dissapointment for me,"I am a big Steely Dan and this Live album is a huge dissapointment for me. The tracks are OK, but the vocals don't sound like Donald Fagen at all, and there is hardly any guitar in the album."
2,Damaging,"Not difficult to install, but they dented my metal doors, poked a hole in my fiberglass doors and dented the molding around the door. I wanted to avoid damaged walls from doorknobs, but ended up with other damage instead."
2,Not worth the 15 dollars,This dvd did give a few good exercises but it was not worth the money. It should be included free with the perfect pushup.
3,Should have included more,"The workouts were good, but for the price should have included a poster or cards that also demonstrated excercises and routines."
3,Not worth the money,"Given the generous price or the perfect pushup devices in the first place, I think this product could have been included. The video is nicely done but is very brief and demonstrates literally 10 exercises. In hindsight, I could have done just as well with a chart of the same exercises (post for free on website?). I would not buy again nor recommend."
1,Can't really say.,Ordered item with push up equipment. DVD is on back order. I wanted to use both of these items together.
4,A Grest Flying tale,Its nice to final feel one has been told the truth instead of the myth and which pilot actually shot down Yamamoto.
3,Rather padded,"I normally snap books like this up. I work in the Intelligence Community as an analyst, and I love stories about intelligence ""coups,"" moments in history where a secret fact supplied at the right time made all the difference in the world. The shootdown of Admiral Yamamoto certainly qualifies as such. I imagine it's a story that American Siginters (signals intelligence personnel) savor.The problem is that the story of the shootdown does not begin until the last third of the book. There are over 200 pages of what I would call exposition and background. It may be well written and researched, but I can't help but think that a much tighter, focused book would have resulted from losing about 150 pages. Written the way it is, I think ""Lightning Strike"" is a deceptive title, ""Slow Waltz"" would have been more appropriate."
3,FUn,My nephews enjoyed this stocking stuffer. THey will be entertained with this gadget for many hours. Entertainment for the kiddos!
4,Oya ye ye,this music is very upbeat and has a lot of variety which makes it diverse. I very much enjoyed it as well as my 20 month old daughter who started to groove to the sounds once she heard it play! :-)
3,simple,"I thought the concept of healing was simple. Most diseases start as a spiritual or emotional problem first then become a physical problem, so use the tarot to find solutions to your problems. Any tarot reader familiar with the laws of attraction really dosen't need this book."
3,I wish the seller packed it better,It is a useful book and I will use it but it was packed poorly and got damaged by postal service.
5,If you do a lot of sanding,If you do a lot of sanding these are great disc's to use and they last a very long time
2,Not a resume-maker for veteran horror scribe...,"I got this selection sent to me by Leisure horror book club because it's not a book I would purchase in a bookstore. The whole premise is okay, but this is a perfect book for people who have trouble sleeping. If you keep reading, it is very possible you will fall asleep.I hate to knock writers, because I know how hard it is to write a good novel. This book is just bad and I almost gave it a lower rating, but there are some decent parts. However what makes it so bad are the cardboard characters and the plot doesn't flow very smoothly.This is not a book Williamson wants to add to his resume as part of his documented writing history."
3,Who has been sleeping in my head?,Quent is an ordinary college student in Indiana. But what about the nightmares? What about the things that he sees and the extraordinary things that he can do? Who is he? What is he? Why can't he remember events that happened more than two years ago? Fun read for those rainy days.
1,GREAT PAPER-WEIGHT,"GORGEOUS MACHINE. KEEPS MY PAPERS FROM BLOWING AROUND. GOT THIS MACHINE SINCE IT IS BASIC, FOR A BEGINNER. THERE IS MISSING PARTS AND THE BOX WAS SEALED. CALLED BROTHERS FOR THE PIECES. THEY WOULD BE GLAD TO SELL AND SEND THEM TO ME FOR A SMALL FEE OF $22.00. HUH?????? THE PRESSER FOOT IS MISSING ALONG WITH THE NEEDLES. SO CAN'T REALLY COMMENT ON EASE (OR NOT)OF USE. SO I AM USING IT FOR A PAPER-WEIGHT TILL I TAKE IT BACK. I GOT THIS MACHINE AT A CLEARANCE PRICE SO BROTHERS OF TENNESEE, WHICH IS THEIR HEAD-QUARTERS, STATED THEY DO NOT HONOR DISCOUNTED PRICES. WHATS WITH THAT??? AFTER READING THE REVIEWS HERE, I WOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN IT TO START WITH. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME."
2,I liked it until it broke after less than a year of light use,"I can't get the tension to work and I'm in the middle of sewing gifts for mother's day, great. I liked it ok but, now I'm irritated. Look for a better beginner machine unless the deal is SOOOOOO good you can't refuse it. I bought mine for $40 on sale. In retrospect, it was worth it but, now I need a new machine."
1,I think the tension knob is purely decorative.,"I am having much the same issues as the other reviewers. There is something terribly wrong with the thread, and adjusting the machine tension gives no results. Actually, switching out the thread, fabric, bobbin style, adjusting the bobbin and machine tension all produced no results. It either doen't sew very well, or it tangles and breaks the thread. Granted, we only paid $40 for the machine, but it has gotten very light use, and buying a new machine for simple projects is a huge let down. My advice would be to take the money you were going to spend on this machine, save up a little more, and get something reliable (and with better documentation)."
2,not a good investment,"My sister bought me this sewing machine a yr. ago, it lasted a little over a yr. Mind you, I do not sew, it was used merely for mending and light sewing. It's not a good investment, save your money and buy not good brand. Seriously, this is NOT a good machine."
2,"Good temporary machine, bad long-term!!","I am so glad to know I'm not the only one who has wasted hours of frustration with this machine! My mom got it for me on sale 2 or 3 years ago and it was good for a little while. Definitely good with basics but then I started having more and more trouble with the thread randomly breaking off and random wadded up bunches of thread on the backs of my projects. No amount of cleaning, oiling, tension tweaking, re-threading or anything else has helped! It will randomly sew fine and then go crazy again. I can't tell you how many times I've had to stop mid-project because of this sewing machine or had to go to hand-sewing!And I thought I was the one having trouble sewing in straight lines, not the machine! Even though you can get this cheap, it's definitely worth it to save up a little more money and get a machine that will last longer and won't make you want to rip your hair out."
1,Lasted One Day,After Fully Charging this battery. I put the battery in my camera and used it for about 20 minutes. Then I turned the camera off and then later in the day I used it for about 10 minutes. I turned the camera off. The following day I could not turn on my camera. I tried to charge the battery again but it would not charge. Terrible product-don't waste your money.
1,useless,"Don't buy this battery! I bought 5 of them last week , & they only last 5 minutes at the most of recording in my Aiptek Action HD GVS 1080P."
5,"Simple and effective!,",I bought it for my Kodak DX6490. Battery is impressive. Seems like it holds a charge better than the original. Recommended highly!
1,Not Recommended,Very disappointed in the length of charge this battery holds. I'm buying a more expensive one with a nice review rating and hoping for the best this time...
5,Can not beat the price,Bought for my HP point and shoot camera. Works great hold charge as good as OEM battery. For $3 you can not go wrong.
3,good,"This item is as useful as can be, is a battery, so it does what batteries do, is very near to in charge time an use of the charge as the original, so for me is very fine."
4,Zeit ist Geld has No subtitles!!!!,"Now or Never is a Delightful film BUT the Amazon film I ordered and received is in German without subtitles. I am hoping for a copy to be found with the subs--; it was shown with subs at a film festival, so I know such a copy exists--Amazon, HELP!"
5,Some of Our Favorite Westerns,"This one was for my husband, who is a great fan of western novels---especially Kelton. He writes like he was really there. His stories match those of my father, who was a rancher in south Texs."
3,EXCELENTE PRODUCTO,"Lo compre para mi esposa ya que pedi el capri lo único que en verdad no entiendo es porque no viene el conjunto completo de una vez, pero es excelente"
5,"Delightful, Charming Book","A wonderful tribute - brought back so many great memories. Congratulations, Drew; it's your best work yet!"
1,No jokes,"No Jokes...I wanted some old Jewish, Catskills jokes. I got a bunch of pictures. I need jokes."
3,MATH IS WRONG!,There are 16 ounces in a pound.$15.99 divided by 16 ounces is almost $1 per ounce.NOT 67 cents per ounce.The price should be $10.72 for that per-ounce price.
3,Almost slapstick fun,"I understand why a previous reviewer was unhappy with this movie. It is superficial and sometimes insensitive. But it is also funny, and easily understood by a non-native speaker. I cringed at the stereotypical moments, but also laughed.I really liked the jealous wife portrayal. Most of the Spanish language movies I have viewed so far have had depressing or highly sexualized themes. This was an exception to that trend.Other than the portrayal of the Chinese boss, there is nothing I would hesitate to show my children or students. And I would use that flaw to talk about different views on cultural portrayals.Not everyone in every culture is worried about offending people.Perhaps when no offense is meant, none should be taken. This is not an artistic or intellectual film.But obviously it wasn't intended to be."
1,DISAPPOINTING READ,"Out of all the anecdotes, only two are entertaining and none is illuminating. Overall, a very boring read."
5,Pretty little dishes!,"Not a necessary addition to the Nova Brown dishes, but very pretty and will have a number of uses. The pottery and colors are beautiful and the price can't be beat!"
3,"Not heat safe, mine cracked!","I love all the Sango brown nova dishes I've been adding to my set, these ramekins looked perfect so I bought two sets of 4. Almost four weeks later when I used them for the first time (tonight), I made flan. That requires a carmel glaze. When I made the glaze in a sauce pan (very hot sugar/water mixture) and then poured it into the ramekins, after I poured the 6th ramekin I started hearing them all crack!! LOUD cracks! So, 6 out of 8 cracked when making a simple flan custard dish in them! Amazon is replacing them of course, but what if I hadn't used them in the first 30 days? If this had happened just two days later, I would have been out of the 30 day amazon warranty!FOLLOW-UP - Set the ramekins in hot water prior to adding extremely hot liquid so that they won't crack."
5,LOVE this stuff!,"Ok the other reviewer needs to REVIEW the practices for LEAVING a review (you're not reviewing the seller, you're reviewing the PRODUCT!)With that being said this stuff is AMAZING!!in fact EVERYTHING Suki makes is amazing. I had the WORST breakouts ever and I started using the cleansing lotion, the balancing toner, the balancing lotion and the eye balm and VOILA! NO MORE BREAKOUTS! Not to mention my skin looks younger! IT's AMAZING!This stuff is AWESOME if you get chapped hands or if you need a little extra moisture (like if you live in a dry climate!) It helps heal scars really well also! I LOVE IT!"
4,bag will come in handy,"Evan though they sent me the wrong style, the bag is still stylish and will function for my dirty cloth diapers. I only give it 4 stars because the draw string part seems worthless to me. But I think the outside pocket will be useful."
4,Only wish it zipped closed,"This bag works for my afternoons out with two in cloth dipaers- meaning it holds 4-6 diapers at least (more if we are using prefolds that day. It's an attractive pattern (although not many people see it besides me) and it works- it holds wetness in and washes easily with no scent remaining. If it had a zipper I'd give it 5 stars, but for the price it's great. I usually carry any plastic bags that my husband tends to bring in from the store to wrap around any really stinky diapers anyway (even when using a zippered bag) and we always shake off anything we can before popping it in the bag anyway, so it's not a huge issue. Also I usually dust the bottom of the bag with baking soda or borax after each wash to further ensure we aren't wandering around with a stinky sack! It does close all the way, you just have to pay attention when you're closing it up at the toggle."
5,Informative,Classic book to exemplify the basics of screenwriting from credible people in the industry. The book shipped on time and the company was very pleasant to work with.
2,Does not cite original sources,"To publish a book that contains the words of philosophers without giving references and source material is ludicrous. Don't just tell me that someone said something, give me give me chapter and verse. In what book did they write it? Which newspaper quoted it? In which magazine was the interview found? When and where did they deliver the speech? There is an endless supply of books and internet sites that quote famous people incorrectly. The common element in all of them is that they don't give the original sources. Every quotation in this book may be factual, but without citing the original sources, there is no way to know short of doing the research the author should have done with each and every entry.Unsourced quotes are just gossip."
5,Important Book!,"As a teacher, I believe that this impressive book should be included in all high school and college libraries!"
3,This is not the The System I know.,"Sorry guys, but this is not the System that I know.This album is boring, full with r&b smooth jams.Maybe you like it, but if you know the old system then you shouldnot buy this record.Sorry, but I hope you will come realy back with a up-tempo album.Greetz Roy."
3,HUH???????,"WHAT HAPPENED?After a decade of recording absence this is NOT AT ALL what I expected!The System have the same lineup butI expected this album to sound more like Daft Punk,whose influence seemed to be a good new direction for this electronicsbased duo.But instead Mic and David take their music on an 180degree turn around toward a series of modern smooth R&B; tuneswith slight techno INFLUENCES-so THIS IS NOT the heavily synthesized dancable madness of yore,no.Full on ballads and lovesongs make up the bulk of it and even the few uptempo tunes such as a remake of their classic ""You Are In My System"" areeven too old school for their 1980's fans!But a few classic funkjams don't make this Keith Sweat/Babyface ripoff album worth that much to your average System fan.Sure it's compedanetlydone,the songs are very good but fans of The System's classicsound will not find music to their liking here.For modern R&B;lovers your right at home.Otherwise,read before purchase."
3,Quite Good For A Comeback,"The System could throw it down back in the day and I was expecting nothing but the best on ""ESP."" However, after listening to it I was a little disappointed. The songs on ""ESP"" are pretty good but they are slow tempo R&B and often become boring to listen to at times. The remake of ""You Are In My System"" sounds okay, but I don't see why it was necessary to remake it at all. Unlike the original, the new version doesn't allow you to throw it down on the dance floor and doesn't have that zest. It actually made me dislike The System's so-called new style a little bit. Overall, Mic Murphy's vocals are still on point and the CD is good despite the lack of up-tempo dance songs. Hopefully, the next CD The System ever puts out will have dance songs similar to the energetic music they put out in the 1980s."
2,Not the system we all remember and love,"We know times change, but when I buy an Album by THE SYSTEM, I expect it to sound like THEM, and not like everything else on the radio in the year 2000 (when this album was produced)they are currently working on a new album, which will sound more like their classic 80's output. (thank God!!)"
4,Current makings considered,"Kegley and Wittkopf take into consideration that the current international political system is in the process of being developed. There are still to many unanswered questions regarding what type of power structure will result, and whether the events of 9/11, humanitarian intervention, globalization, and the rise of the EU and China will have transforming affects on the global arena. Further, many facets are considered regarding the increased role of non-state actors like NGO and individuals having a voice. It's worth the read as current events and issues are at the focal point of the structure of the international system."
4,Well Done,"I took an international relations course awhile ago, and this book was part of the required reading. While it does not provide a complete overview of IR, it does a very good job at the intro level. Specifically, the text does a very thorough job of adressing globalization, the global south, and introductory political economy. I would suggest buying this book and then reading the works of the political scientists upon which much of the theory is based (Mearsheimer, Nye, Waltz, Angell, Doyle, Morganthau, Carr, etc.)"
2,dull,"everytime i tried to read this gibberish i felt like passing out. one of those texts that keeps going and going and in the end you learn very little. as an introduction to IR, it killed my interest in the area."
1,Disappointed...,"I'm in the middle of reading this book for a test I have in two days and I cannot help but be completely distracted by Kegley's obvious bias against the Bush administration. It's one thing to write a book about your views about Iraq and the mistakes Bush made, however this is a TEXTBOOK; textbooks must present information without biases in order for the student to make up his/her own mind on the subject.I'm incredibly disappointed in Kegley and the publishers who released this TEXTbook."
2,"Of some help, but dispensible","I have taught Latin for many years. If one has a copy of the latest Wheelock, then the workbook is dispensible. It is too repetitive and tends towards being excessively easy. If you are a relatively adult learner, I recommend using Betts' _Teach yourself Latin_, which has the answers at the back, or Sidwell's _Reading Latin_, which has a guide for independent study."
1,"After 8 months, the (photocopied) Answer Key arrives","I wrote an earlier review in which I stated that the publisher had failed to send me the Answer Key they promise to those using this book for independent study. Well, after 8 months of waiting (and writing the publisher to ask when the Answer Key would arrive), I received my copy. To my surprise, the Answer Key turned out to be a series of photocopies stapled together. In light of this, I'm a bit confused why the publisher kept reassuring me that the book would be sent once they had done another printing -- couldn't they have done the photocopying months ago? In any case, by now I've advanced past the point where this Workbook (even with the Answer Key) is of any use to me. So, again, those who wish to use this book for independent study, beware."
1,Independent learners beware!,"For those of us who are embarking on an independent course of study, this is not a good buy. The reason? No answer key. The book is apparently written and constructed with only the academic community in mind. The independent learner was given little thought. The hassle and delay involved in obtaining the answer key is not worth the time that most of us would rather spend enjoying the process of learning Latin."
2,No you can't get the answer key,"I have tried e-mail( which was ignored ) and calling the 800 number. When I called Harpers Collins I was told that the answer key was available to professors only. When I told her that the front of the book informed me that independant study students could get the answer key, she informed that it was out of print and not available at all! She took my name and address and said if it ever became available I would get a copy. I asked when that might be and she told me she had no idea and thought that someone was putting on the internet. I bought the book based on the assumption I would be able to get the answer key. The book might deserve more than 2 stars but without the answer key it doesn't help me much."
3,Good Questions but no answers,This is an excellent workbook to compliment the Wheelock's latin text. The only problem is that there are is no answer guide thus making it extremely hard to know whether you are right without asking the teacher everytime.
3,Not very happy,"Wheelock's Latin and workbook seemed like an excellent choice... They were both recommended to me by numerous people at various bookstores so I decided to go ahead and purchase them. What I didn't know was that there is no answer key to the workbook. After finding two addresses that you can supposedly email to get a password for an answer key I emailed them both. Two weeks and a few emails letter, I still have no answer key!If I don't hear back soon, I'm going to return them. A workbook is useless if you do not know if what you are working on is correct!Anyone with suggestions on how I can get the answers?"
3,"Redeemed, somewhat...","After about a month of letters, faxes, and e-mails, Harper Collins finally provided me, the independent student of Latin, with a copy of the answer key to this workbook. Nevertheless, the valuable time spent obtaining the key detracted from the amount of time I have been able to dedicate to my studies, and therefore, I have been unable to progress very far in the book. My advice: this appears to be a decent workbook, and is certainly valuable in its own right because of the amazing qualities of Wheelock's itself, so if you are willing to put up with a little hassle, this book is for you. If your time and nerves are limited, however, look elsewhere."
3,no-hassle answer key?? yeah right.,"I called the 800 number that another reviewer posted. As soon as I asked for an answer key, the customer service lady knew what book I was referring to. She asked me if I am faculty, to which I said no. I am an independent student. Sorry, I can't send it to you. Take it up with your bookstore. Harper doesn't care about getting independent students' money. They should have a sticker on it that reads ""FOR SCHOOLS ONLY"". Now I'll have to return this book, which is still en route in some mailbag, since the publisher is more concerned now about a metriculated student of latin trying to pass an A on homework. That's okay, there are plenty of other Wheelock's suppliments from other publishers instead of HARPER. I could double check the work myself, or try to find the answer key online, but I'd much rather get my money back and return the product out of spite. As you can see, I gave the workbook a ""neutral"" 3. I'm giving the publisher's customer service a 1."
1,Key Problems,"I have written the e-mail address twice for the key and have not had a response. This is shocking.The workbook itself merely alerts you that you have to memorize, as a Bard, exactly word for word, the Wheelock 6e. I kid you not. One slight grammer mention has to be memorized and the work book ""tests"" you on your Barding skills. You mime Wheelock not Latin. He says; You say. Word for word."
3,Good complement to the text.,"This book has useful exercises that go right along with what you will learn in the Wheelocks text. I am still trying to get an answer key (2 months later). Most of the exercises can be proved correct with a little work, although it can be daunting and frustrating."
4,Helpful for the audodidact,"The quality of the pages are very poor, of the super-low-quality, tear-out workbook level. The label ""workbook"" is also no joke--it's full of multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions. The grammar and vocab drill are very useful, and on that basis, it would be a 5.But some of the questions are condescending to the point that my middle school Spanish book would not have even considered including them--did-you-read-the-chapter sort of checks. In addition, the Latin-English grammar link sections are rather insulting. On the basis of the quality of the paper and the tedious childishness of some of the questions, the workbook loses a star. I do wish it had been just a bit more sophisticated."
2,Caveat emptor!,"While Comeau, LaFleur, and HarperCollins emphasize the usefulness of Wheelock's Latin for those learning the language independently, this Workbook does not make it easy for the independent learner. Although the book states that the answer key is available for free not only to educators but to those who verify independent study status, HarperCollins has continually refused my requests, as an independent student of Latin, for the answer key. Therefore, I am left with a book that seems to contain excellent excercises in Latin, but with no way of checking my work. I have had so much trouble obtaining the answer key that I am even considering returning the book. Buyer beware!"
3,You don't need this if you have the 6th edition...,"This is a good workbook, but if you have ""Wheelock's 6th edition, revised"", you don't need this. Most of the exercises here are repetitions of the ""Optional Self-Tutorial Exercises"" in the back of the main book. Sometimes they repeat the *exact* same sentence to be translated! I felt a little deceived. But, I got the answer key easily, despite some complains about it here. They sent me the key in the same day."
1,Wheelock workbook not suitable for independent study,"I find I am about to echo the disappointment of another reviewer who found the publisher unresponsive to his request for a key to the workbook, although the publisher offers such a key. Like that reviewer, the workbook is useless to me without correct answers, as I don't want to practise unknown errors. I have gotten to chapter 5 of the excellent Wheelock textbook, using a key found on the internet which is for a previous edition but usable. However, I will probably return the workbook which is valuless if the exercises can't be corrected. I would surely advise other aspiring independent students to find any ""teach-yourself"" Latin book for extra practise, despite Wheeelock's brilliant textbook. If a key to translation weren't needed, one could make up for oneself any number of sentences to translate!"
5,Another homeschool mother,"This workbook is a great for drilling/mastering the Latin concepts in the corresponding chapters in Wheelock's Latin. I'm working through it now myself. I really like extra drill for mastering/internalizing a new language, even though I don't have trouble with grammatical concepts in general (I studied Spanish and French in college, and German after college. I love languages--I was also a computer software consultant before I began homeschooling my children).I'll also be using this workbook with my kids when they're ready for it (perhaps in 7th or 8th grade). They're currently working through Martha Wilson's Latin Primer series.Also, thank you very much to the reader who posted the 800 number for the publisher. I called it to request the answer key after I ordered the workbook here on Amazon. They sent it at no charge via UPS, and it arrived in just 6 days (and it beat the workbook to my house)."
3,you will like it !!!,"very good product, it gives you protection and comfort to play your favourite sport ,,,4 stars"
1,Disappointed,"The wrap was much too long and narrow and just didn't do what I expected of this type product. Overall, it felt uncomfortable and slipped even with the velcro. I would not recommend this product because of the narrow width. If it was 6"" wide instead of a very narrow 3"" it might feel more comfortable"
2,Old School Genetics,"Published in 1965, ""The Gene Concept"" is a condensed handbook of old school genetics. The author sets out to describe some of the early experiments that led to modern day genetic concepts. Unfortunately, we are not taken from the ""characters"" and ""elements"" of Mendel to the molecular nucleotide sequence within the genome as smoothly as one might expect. Eventhough we are told that the text will clarify, the author does little to clearly define the terms used in the book such as trait, factor, gene, allele, non-alleles, sets of factors, sets of alleles, etc. Many of these terms are overloaded and used interchangeably throughout, leaving the reader to determine the meaning on his own from within context. For the uninitiated, this terse book would be extremely confusing. The beginning student, if not turned away, would have many unanswered questions."
5,I feel like Bustin' Loose ! ! !,"I've always argued that Chuck Brown's really a guy you gotta catch live, because live is him at his best... and even when you catch him live on tape, it doesn't sound good as live in person... but then, I forgot about ""CLASSIC"" Chuck Brown... and this is the album that has that has him when he did know how to sizzle in the studio... the right ""greatest"" hits were picked for this compilation... BUSTIN LOOSE, MONEY, BACK IT ON UP and many of the others are house party funk dance classics. - - If you're not lucky enough to be able to catch him live ASAP, and need a dose, buy two, three or four copies of this, and play it everywhere !"
3,after using it for several months,"It looks great, it does leak at the base gasket. Once it unscrewed itself and the entire batch hit the floor. I cut a piece of gasket material and it does seal now. The idea of the spigot is good BUT I wouldn't get one with that feature as the cleaning presents a problem. Additionally, I sent the registration card into the MFG but it was returned 'address unknown'. One more thing: I thought of using it to blend hot soup but I'm in doubt of the effect on the plastic."
1,"Loved it, then it BROKE","I LOVED this unit, if you are getting a smoothie maker, getting one with a spout is important. No blender is perfect so there will always be little chunks of ice, but the spout does not let them fall in the glass. The stir stick is also really useful for getting the ice to actually get chopped up. I also found the markings on the side of the blender to be useful, they tell you how much ice to liquid you should add.Then it broke. I had it for about 3 months, I maybe used it once a week when the plastic gears that make the blade spin snapped right off and now it is useless."
2,cheap and cheaply made,"We bought this because it was about the only one we could afford, and that should say it all. This blender is almost completely plastic and has no power at all. The spigot is useful, but you have to keep the blender running while you use the spigot, and the whole thing is a pain to clean. Not a long term commitment, but good for the occasional smoothie."
5,Amazing Book,This book was exactly how it was described. I am well pleased with my purchase. I grew up reading Egermeier's Bible Story Book. This was a sentimental purchase for me.
4,Wonderful Children's Book,"I read and re-read this as a child. I was a great fan of fairy tales and this is a classic. I agree with the other reviewer that some might find this saccharine today, but it is a fun adventure story and has all the qualities of an excellent fairy tale. I highly recommend it."
3,There's some good music here,"I don't recall where I first heard Caterina Valente, but the song she sang (Boom?) made a big impression. The music on this dual-album CD contains some of her best songs. If you like big band music and vocals, there's a good chance you'll enjoy this CD."
5,Man-size duct tape,"Now this is what duct tape should be like. Big enough do handle any job, sticks great, it is the best duct tape I have ever used.I had wondered if it would be difficult to handle tape that is almost 4 inches wide - turns out it is very easy to use. I actually have less trouble tearing it than the 2 inch tape."
5,Hard to find,"This movie means alot to a goood friend of mine. She went to the same college as Jean Donovan. Because both Jean Donovan and my friend are devout Christians, my friend being a devout and practicing Catholic in every great way Catholics and all Christians are called to be, she wanted to view this movie to see what Jean Donovan ""went through."". The movie was terrific and so appreciated by my friend. And Jean we appreciate what you did and tried to do in your charity and love for the oppressed. THANKS AMAZON for making it possible to buy this movie. AMAZON you make it possible to find and buy things that are NOT available anywhere else."
5,civil war,"I recomended this documental to those american tax payer so they can realize what there goverment U.S.A help to kill the innocents and most unfortunless peoples just for been poor and helpless. helping country's corrupted by greddy, class , and hate as it happenn in el salvador ."
2,disappointing,"After Falling in love with the first three books of this series(I read the Painter Knight 4 times), this book was somewhat of a letdown. This story had little character development and felt more like a short story. Its still a decent book but is lacking the power and appeal of the 1st three books."
5,Lightning fast!,"I am thrilled with this drive - it's lightning fast, compact, easy to carry around in my briefcase. As a photographer, I load all my photos on it and then import them into Lightroom. This procedure works well and keeps Lightroom running fast, too."
2,Doesn't do the job,"The Aegis 160 GB Firewire portable drive is a real disappointment. The biggest problem is that in most cases, it just doesn't work. On three of four computers that I used it on, it isn't recognized, doesn't power up, and is basically useless.On the one computer where it worked, it did the job, but not noticeably faster than a USB2 unit of the same size.Since it is supposed to be portable, not working on 75% of the machines on which I tested it proved to be less than adequate to the task. My recommendation is to buy a USB2 unit, instead.Because it is, indeed small and external, and works, I did not give it a single star, but two."
1,One star is already too much,"I have owned two of these, both defective. Lost all my data the first time around. Wrote email to customer service, no reply from anyone. Suggest a more reliable product like Western Digital, your data is really too important to risk it with this product."
4,Handy Little Item,I used to use a regular carabiner for holding my keys.Now I use this. I use a small piece of hose to keep the ends holding the keys closed securely. I had a friend of mine lose a couple of keys and a usb thumb drive because the spring force is not high enough to prevent accidental release.
3,Double check the ACTUAL size!!!!,These S-Biners are A LOT smaller than you would think. Size 3 is almost too small to even use as a key ring.
2,As noted by others you WILL LOSE KEYS!,I had high hopes for using the #1 and #2 as keyrings. Unfortunately keys repeately fall off the biner due to the lack of spring tension and/or sufficiently deep notch to keep keys from catching the spring.
3,Spring Action not strong enough,"I often find my keys and other items dislodged in my pockets because the spring action was not strong enough to hold things in place. If you are planning on using these S-BIners for your keys and keep them in your pockets, I would say find a different product."
3,Needs broken in.,"The shoes weren't very comfortable at first, cutting around the top of the ankle, and because the zipper tab wasn't very long, it made them hard to zip at first. I've been wearing them to work for a couple weeks now, and they're not too bad. The footbed IS comfy, after you get used to the hard outsole. And they're very slip resistant. That was one of the reasons I bought these shoes, and they lived up to that promise. All in all, they require a little breaking in, but after that, a pretty good shoe."
5,Great Value for sub $300 system,The 5 DVD changer is great. The sound quality is above what you would expect from a system of this cost level. A little light on the high end I feel but really depends a lot on your sound source as well. Some say they think the bass is weak but I found if I put the sub-woofer box on it's back pointing up to the ceiling I get great bass. More than I want. Speaker placement is everything. Try several different placements and hear the difference. All in all I am very happy except I wish the highs were a little more tinkly.
2,loose leash not for aggressive toddler,"Cons:1. Too loose, not adjustable enough on a skinny toddler. Not tight and secure like other leashes.2. Hot monkey on your back in the scorching summer3. small pocket is very small and mine had velcrow/not zipper closure.4. Buckles will hold strong fat toddler.Pros:So soft and cudly, My son loves to sleep with itCute at disneyland and malldirt/sweat shows up way too easy"
3,"Very cute idea, but not the greatest design","We bought the bear version of this product to help my little boy stay with us when we're out. He can now escape from the stroller easily, and he is way faster than my pregnant body can keep up with. My husband's cousin's little boys have loved their little ""backpacks,"" and my son was really excited to wear his. However, when we got the harness home, as I was looking at the design of the product, I realized that having the buckles in the FRONT would not work for us--my son knows how to open those kinds of buckles. He would be out of that in a flash! And many other children would be able to escape easily, too. I'm sure that there is a way to design this product with the buckles in back under the backpack so only the parent can access them! We are taking our harness back and getting one with no fasteners in front. Nice idea, but not designed too intelligently."
5,Now we both feel safer!,"My 1 year old went from crawling straight to RUNNING. I bought this harness after I set him down in a store while I paid at the checkout, and he was gone in a flash. Luckily, we were the only ones in the small store. It scared me enough to search out a harness. We tried it on at home and it works great! It comes fully assembled, all you do is click the two belts into place. It goes on like a vest. It's light and soft and loose enough to not bother him at all. He wears it around like a backpack and thinks he's pretty awesome with his new accessory. We only use it when we're out shopping and there are no carts for him to sit in, though. But please use it sparingly - if I wanted a wild thing on a leash, I would have bought a puppy."
4,Folk rock for starters,Great folk rock with some progressive elements on it. After getting this compilation you'll be encouraged to get all the albums.The voice sounds close to the Cranberies but focus on the instrumentation and forget about the poppy Cranbs. Very Celtic and a true English folk music.
3,Must Have Been a Bad Year,"Most of the stories in this edition of ""Year's Best Fantasy Stories"" are not terrible. Unfortunately, none of them are destined to be classics, either. By and large, the stories are readable but not memorable. Perhaps the sole exception is ""Wrong Dreaming"" by Kain Massin, which is an Australian tale of aboriginal magic that is very evocative and moving. Sarah Singleton's ""Ebb Tide"" is also moving, although its story of mermaid love has been done many times before. The contributions of the heavyweights, George R.R. Martin and Terry Goodkind, are excerpted or related to their best-selling series, and so are almost cheating. Read this one if you've not much else to read, but do not expect to be impressed."
2,Took 2 months to receive!,"The drama to get this CD was ridiculous, but the husband was happy ONCE we he got it, although 3 weeks late for his B-day!"
4,OSCE and Clinical Skills Handbook,Quite helpful and stimulating though it could do much better with some discussion on pathology/lab results.
2,Not what I expected.,"This item is not particularly what I expected. If you are looking for something that gives you detailed patient scenarios and allows you to diagnose and treat, this is not the book for you. This book is more like a textbook. I wanted something more of a practice like book."
2,Miner's Massacre.....,"I've never been the first to review a movie!! I rented this movie being a horror fan and any movie with the word massacre in the title is a movie for me! This movie isn't all that bad. It centers around 3 couples who go to a ghost town to try to find gold in a old mine. They end up bringing to life a dead miner who now takes revenge on anyone who tries to take ""his"" gold. Some good scenes in this movie. Overall, not a bad movie to rent, it's worth the $4 !!!!"
1,So bad it's good.,"What do you get when you cross the creeper, jason voorhees, and madman marz? The 49er that's what. It so obvious that this film was gonna be bad, so it should've been gorier. Th 49er is obviously a rip-off of the creeper from jeepers creepers. He kills like jason and madman marz, and has that ghost story that madman marz did. But this ""film"" doesn't get off easy. It is totally void of anything remotely scary (duh) but it is a film which you and your buds can sit down and make fun of it. Acting=CRUD! SCORE=CRUD! DIRECTOR=CRUD! SCRIPT=CRUD! and Miner's Massacre=Pure cheezy fun. Rent it."
2,They Axed For It!,"I can't read the credits. Is that a bad sign? What else can they screw up? Three couples who, quite frankly, seem to hate each other, go on a camping trip in search of some lost gold. What they don't know about is the curse of the Forty-Niner, Jeremiah Stone. If someone steals his gold, his ghost comes back to kill them. Wait. ""I Want Me Gold!"" This is cribbed straight from the pages of Leprechaun. Anyway, they steal the gold, get hunted, and find out from a hysterical, overwrought Aunt Nelly (Karen Black) that they need to return it to stop the curse. A few things amused me. Jeremiah bites off his own finger for no reason. A fender bender turns into a massive two car explosion. And Aunt Nelly has apparently never heard of stop, drop, and roll."
4,Lots of fun!,"The movie is so bad, it's hilarious! The actors(?) are comatose, the story line has been done to death, it's not at all suspenseful and the ending is pathetic. This is a must see. Really, don't pass this one up."
1,Worst. Movie. Ever.,This movie is a travesty. the acting is so bad it makes me sick and it has absolutely no thrills or chills. anybody who gives this higher than a one star needs to have their testicles removed surgically. It tries to copy friday the 13th and it fails miserably. any of those movies are 10 times better than this piece of sh--. I dont recommend this to anybody not even the people i hate. its terrible!!!!
5,very engaging book,This book helped so many people see themselves more clearly. Because it is written so conversationally (10 people are talking together about their journey to recover from the effects of growing up with alcoholism in the family) this book is very engaging. There are so many examples of what people talk about in therapy; in fact the dialogue will give people lots of permission to open up and talk in therapy. It may also be a wonderful resource for people who are ambivalent about entering treatment. Together We Heal is a wonderful contribution to the field. Thank you Szifra and Kathy.
5,excellent product,"I scratched my original cd, and could not find a replacement. Thank god for amazon. I am pleased with the condition and delivery of this product."
3,Jonathan Butler is awesome.,This CD is amazing. We keep it in our car cd and listen over and over and it just gets better and better!
4,The album title avails,"This album is almost pure praise and worship with maybe two ""inspirational"" songs. The album is very consistent. The instrumentation is soulfully rhythmic, meditative and soothing. A must-have. Jonathan's vocals and background singers are great."
3,Make sure you have the Bessey TGK series clamps,I just got these as a gift and was a bit surprised at what was included. I have not had a chance to use them yet since the bar clamps I do have will not fit in these. The insert area is very small and looks like it will only fit the Bessey TGK series clamps. The clamps are NOT included as was thought by the gift giver. You need at least one large clamp and one small clamp as shown in the picture. Also the Ball and Socket are not attached to each other so it may take a few tries and an extra set of hands to use.
5,You should read this book.,"Barnes' mastery of imagery is superlative. She has written a thoughtful, entertaining and powerful novel. If you don't read it, you'll never know."
2,Game is Terrible,After owning NBA live 05 and 06 this game is a huge dissappointment. I have never played 2k7 but I am considering purchasing it because this game is just terrible.
1,The worst game ever,"EA lost it. NBA LIVE is the WORST NBA game now, no questions asked. Buy NBA 2K7. Much much better."
2,ITS OVER 4 NBA LIVE,"ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I'VE BEEN A NBA LIVE FAN FROM DAY ONE AND I'VE ONLY HAD A PROBLEM WITH ONE YEAR AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS 97. NOW 10 YEARS LATER LIVE 07 IS STRAIGHT UP WACK... THE UPGRADES ON SOME THINGS ARE ALRIGHT. I LIKE THE LITTLE BUSINESS ASPECT BUT THE CONTROL EA COULD HAVE LEFT THE SAME... I GUESS THEY REALLY DIDN'T FOCUS CAUSE PS3 IS ABOUT TO COME OUT BUT EA MESS UP THIS ONE. THEY SHOULD'VE STUCK WITH THE POPULAR SLOGAN ""IF IT AIN'T BROKE DON'T FIX IT"" I'D RATHER KEEP PLAYING 06. I GUESS THEY WANTED TO TRY TO USE EVERY BUTTON ON THE CONTOLLER MAN DAMN THAT IT WAS GREAT LAST YEAR, LEAVE IT ALONE..........."
2,Very disappointed with NBA Live 07,"I have played NBA Live since day 1. The changes that EA has made to NBA Live 07 were such a disappointment that I am going to go and buy NBA2K7. First, they made it harder to dunk. You have to use the left analog and the triangle instead of just leaving it the same way it was last year. The freethrows are now with the analog stick which makes it a little more difficult. The graphics look like cartoon figures. They could have just tweaked last years version, but they tried to do too much with the game and ended up messing up a good franchise. I think I may have purchased my last NBA Live unless they go back to the way that they use to be. Some people like playing for fun and EA has taken out all the fun out of this poor excuse for a game. This game is so bad that the NY Knicks are rated a 92 overall. They were one of the worst franchises last year and now they are one of the best as far as skill level. Save $10.00 and buy NBA2K7."
3,Not as good as 2k7,"Having played both live 07 and 2k7 the definite winner is 2k7. The graphics in live seem too grainy, the load time is very long, and the game seems to lag quite often. The only real upside is the slam dunk contests which hasn't really changed from live 06. 2k7 has much smoother graphics and is much easier on the eyes."
2,Keep-it-close mode,"This game is terrible. I usually really enjoy EA Sports games, but this one is a major letdown. To sum it up, Luke Ridnour just dropped 57 points on my team. I only lost by two, but basically the game makes one person absolutely unstoppable each game. If you get a big lead, the computer basically takes over the game, you miss lay-ups, and the computer makes triple-covered threes. The game is very unrealistic and the fact that there is never a blow-out is lame. I will now be switching to NBA 2k7."
3,NBA Live 07,"I bought this game new, i like it but i think it is a little complicated to be played even if i select the rookie mode, and i can't figure out how to improve my slam dunk skills, anyway is a good addition."
1,I took a chance on this...,"And I wound up sorely disappointed. If you're like me, and you enjoy the latter-day ""Romero"" style of zombie characterization, then this book will be a complete disappointment. Not a single dismemberment or instance of human flesh eating in sight! Perhaps a quarter to a third of the stories don't even deal with zombies, and more than half of the total are voodoo zombies, which I consider dreadfully boring. The remainder are random in nature, with zombies that are atypical.Some of the stories are mildly entertaining, but most are boring and pointless, attempting social satire and failing. If you don't find voodoo zombies fascinating, you will find this book pretty worthless."
4,For eclectic music lovers!,Very relaxing cd. Great Christmas present for a music lover that likes harps and listening to different styles.
5,Door knobs,The finish is just as I wanted it and they work beautifully...........so much nicer than the old ones we replaced! I will probably be ordering more as we continue renovating.
4,For children older than four.,"Purchased this for my 4 1/2 year old, but I did not give it, as it is for an older child. Will save it for later."
3,SMBC Research,I enjoyed this movie. It is a little outdated given it was done in 1997. It was nice to see that these women were the pioneers. I feel much more women are making that choice today. I am glad the director did several different time periods. There was even an update from 1999-2007. I was disappointed not every woman in the group was profiled.It really showed the journey. Also what they thought motherhood would be. To what it actually was. I wanted more at the end. I guess in this facebook and blogger age. I wanted their websites so I could go and get an update.
2,"Dull, But Fun","There isn't very much here that I'd describe as memorable or groundbreaking fiction. However, the story is entertaining enough and offers a glimpse of an early feminism in American letters that is important to acknowledge."
1,"Superlative movie, horrible dvd",It is a sad commentary on Indian DVD manufacturers that the maestro Satyajit Ray gets such a shoddy treatment on DVD. Please don't buy this Angel video version of the film.Go in for the Sony classics version or the bfi version which has the trilogy on 3 discs. I have the latter and its worth every cent.If there were more than 5 stars I wouldnt hesitate to give them to this masterpiece of world cinema. But the Angel video dvd... yuck.
3,"Great band, terrible production & sound quality","This one is hard to rate. The band gets 5 stars, the sound quality and production get 1 star, hence my score of 3 stars. Kevin Chalfant and Josh Ramos formerly of the Storm return with their second effort under the Two Fires name. Their self-titled debut was melodic rock at its best so I was excited about this release, only to be greatly disappointed. The production sinks the effort. Nonetheless, the tracks Somewhere Far Away, More Than a Mystery, and The Man I Want To Be are the highlights. Josh Ramos was not happy with the fact that Chalfant brought in a guest guitarist to play on the track Ignition, which then became the name of the album, which may mark the end of their collaborations. Since, Ramos has released a solo album and Chalfant has joined Shooting Star."
2,Really disappointed,"The production quality is really poor on this CD. If theyhad a good production/mix, then I would bump it up to 3-4 stars.Track #3 is my favorite and you can feel the Survivor influenceson it. The rest is so raw from poor production that it is hardto really get into. I had high hopes and am very disappointed.I would recommend ""91 Suite"" to all lovers of melodic rock. Itis the best CD I have bought in 5 years."
2,werewolf?,"I have no Idea what this film is but it's not a ""werewolf"" film..The werewolf plot is kind of pasted on this film.What this movie is really just a girl on girl softcore porn flick.If your looking for that.. Then this is your film.If not stay away.it's all shot on video.The werewolf makeup sucks and you only see it fortunately in the last 5 mins of the film.About the only thing of any quality is the box art.The only reason I give it 2 star's is that it's ok. softcore porn.But not worth the money."
2,An Erotic Werewolf in London... the Worst movie I have ever seen,"This movie I have really looking fowerd to see, thinking it was a really cool Werewolf film with a small twist..like nudity/offering/erotic horror kind away if you get the point, but I really got disapointed when I saw it was just another stupid pornmovie where they have a this girl thet is a werewolf hunting sexy beautiful girls to have sex with they and insted of orgasm she turns in to a werewolf (well if you can call a girl with big boobs and long whit hair on her arms and abit of hair on her body... long nails and long teeth of a werewolf tho)then she kills them.This is the dummest and the stupist Movie I have ever seen!"
1,It's bad,"The whole movie is basically a C grade porno. ''Special'' effects are awful and very cheap. Even in ''making out'' scenes they were cheating. A few times you could see they were making out with an air, not a partner. Only empty moves and moans, if you know what I mean. I can't write it in other words, because amazon don't let me post it. Like a last review. I have to change words on another ones, because they don't allow to use them in reviews. Werewolf scenes are repeating constantly. Yes, I mean it. They use the same scenes over ten times. As for the plot, there is a plot in here, not much of it but it's present."
4,Cute serving dish!,I just love this cute little dish! I wish they still had the brown one I would order more!I don't use it in the oven very much but I haven't had any problems. I agree with others that Sango overall quality has gone downhill somewhat. But for low cost dishes that look super cute I'm still a fan.I have had some chipping but only when I have knocked them hard or they got really banged around in the dishwasher (husbands shouldn't load dishwashers!)
4,No problems (yet),This is my favorite little dish. I am a fan of oven to table dishware. Almost all of my other items are from Le Creuset. This one has held up just fine although I haven't tried temps. above 350F. I've had two of the Le Creuset dishes break in two at temps above 450F so I wouldn't dare. So far microwave cooking has been fine although it should be noted that my microwave is new.
5,Gorgeous!,"I love the entire Nova Blue set. This dish is beautiful! I use it for all sorts of dinner side dishes. I haven't used it in the oven, microwave or dishwasher, so I don't know how it would hold up there. I consider it more of a decorative piece for our table, instead of something for cooking/baking in."
5,Read this book! 1,"Since reading hear book i have been hired by two major airlines...If you are serious about becoming a flight attendant, this book is a must!"
5,Essential is the word!,"Now ever since I saw that movie about flight attendants with Gwyneth Paltrow in it ""A View From the Top"" I wanted to become a flight attendant myself. I wanted to learn everything I could about becomign a stewardress. When I got this book in the mail from Amazon, and started to read it, I got so excited about the career that I couldn't stop reading it! It tells you everything and I mean everything you need to know about becoming a flight attendant. I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in becoming one!"
1,The Essential Guide To Becoming A Flight Attendant,"The book was very helpful. I have tried interviewing for a flight attendant position with various airlines off and on over a period of several years. I was never able to get past the first part of the group interviews. I was doing a lot of things right, but Kiki's book mentioned several things to do/not do which were different for what I had been doing. I followed her advice and the first interview I had following the purchase of the book, I not only made it to the one on one interview, I was offered a job!Kiki is extremely helpful answering any additional questions via email and is very prompt in responding. Her resume service is also excellent."
2,The Essential Guide To Becoming A Flight Attendant,The book was poorly written and put together. There were numerous misspellings through out the little book. I read it once and the pages fell out of the glued binder. Poor workmanship all the way around. I wasted my hard earned money on a book I purchased in good faith to gain knowledge and hopefully employment from. I hope no one else has to lose their money as well.
5,Hired at my first interview!,"When I ordered this book, I was very skeptical about all of the five star reviews. To me, that usually means that the author or publisher has gotten all of their friends to give it five stars. But when I received the book, I was delighted to find that it definitely deserves all five stars! I followed all of the tips in the book and I was offered the job at my very first flight attendant interview. I'm so grateful that I read this book! I could not find ANYWHERE online that offered this much information about the process, and it made me feel like I actually had an idea of what I was doing. However, there are a TON of typos in the book, but that's not enough of a problem to detract from the wonderful content."
4,"""Must"" reading for today's hunters and future hunters","This book, albeit a slim volume is to be valued by veteran hunters and those new to the sport. The real emphasis is on the ethics of hunting well. Additional topics covered are well addressed. This book has been used in many state-sponsored hunter education courses, after having read it you will understand why. The author, who has impecible credentials as a wildlife biologist and hunter himself makes a valid case for continuing our national right to hunt."
5,Nicely stated in plain english,"As a certified Hunter Safety Instructor, I have found the BEYOND FAIR CHASE states what we are trying to teach in an easy to understand way.We know that every new hunter has an emotional feeling the first time they kill a living animal and watch it die. Some can never hunt again. This book helps one to understand the part they are playing in wildlife management and how to do it in an ethical manner."
1,"WELL MEANING, BUT CONFUSED","Posewitz, though well meaning, sets back our understanding of ethical hunting by confusing ""difficulty of taking"" an animal with ethics. He further does not seem to know that ""fair chase"" is a term created by the Boone & Crockett Club to describe their tournament rules for entering animals into their record books, much like golfing's rule that mechanized golf carts cannot be used by contestants. In spite of this, no one seriously suggests that it is unethical for recreational golfers to use golf carts, however. Ethical hunting is hunting that is: (1) Safe, (2) Conserves game populations for future generations, and (3) Respects the choices and rights of other hunters within the same boundaries. Whether I hunt with my bare hands, walking miles to get to the game, or select some easier way has nothing to do with ethics. Posewitz is entitled to hunt as he wishes, but he should not try to impose his views on others."
5,All the nitty gritty you want!,"This is by far the most enjoyable book I have ever read.It gives a complete detailed look at the lives of the greatest rock performers of our time. This book is a must for anyone, and not just music fans.Their story educates people on the dangers of drug use, and life itself."
5,Walk This Way,I just finished this book and it is a must have for anyone who is an Aerosmith fan. It tells you everything and a kite about the band. It also has some very good pictures of the band members. You learn stuff about them that you never would have guessed
3,This was a fun book to read but these guys aren't perfect,I was disappointed that steve and Joe glamorise taking HERON. It did nothing for them but but make them suffer in ther personal lives and disappoint the fans who bought albums in the latter seventies. HEY STEVEN if you think that taking heron makes you feel like God you should continue with therapy. It was an entertaining read and I love most of the songs but it makes me wonder how great they could have been if they were more dedicated to their work and not hiding in a dark room some place. And by they way sorry about all the probelms you had while touring in my home town.
3,The Bad boys of Rock Tell all!!,"I consider myself an Aerosmith Expert and I thought the book was full of information I hope to see more books about the wrolds greatest Rock band!I would also like to see the Group who are so well-known world wide Do alittle more charity work,You never hear of anything charitable they are doing besides their $10,000 dollar donation for Art a few years ago.For one of the richest bands in the world that is a drop in the bucket!"
2,Initial review,I went through couple of pages of this book and form these couple of pages i can say that this book worth reading for all the true aficinados of aerosmith. Long live aerosmith... kishore
4,Very well written and engrossing,"A compilation of writings documenting the words of band members, spouses, ex-spouses, hangers-on, roadies, dope dealers, ex-marines and others. Delivered in a timeline style, with brutal honesty from the participants about their time in the life, the multiple addictions, getting clean and staying that way. Very current, includes Nine Lives. Makes you realize how good these guys were (are) to have played so long when they were completely fried."
4,Never dull.,"This is an excellent book in that all five members have equal say in what it was like being Aerosmith. They're brutally honest about themselves and what has happened to their lives in and out of the band. A lot of the stories are funny, others will have you shaking your head and none of it is dull. None of the people in this book pull any punches and the author does a good job of just staying out the way and letting people tell their stories."
3,Repetitive and Desultory,"Aerosmith's autobiography Walk This Way describes the band's rollercoaster ride through decadence, drugs, rock and roll, fast cars, and fast women. Reading the book, however, gives one a bumpy, desultory ride. The reader gains interesting insight about the band members, but many tangents interrupt the narrative flow in the book. For instance, Steven Tyler and Joe Perry speak out about their life experiences and this follows with details from managers, crew, and friends. Repetitive at times. The information about drug addiction gets old after awhile. Although this will please Aerosmith fans, newcomers might get lost in the sand."
5,Incredible!,"First, I'd like to state that my favorite books are autobiographies about musicians. That being said, this is probably the best one I have ever read.I bought this book along with three others, and it was the one I was the least excited about reading. But, from the very beginning, this one just grabs you. It's one of those books that you never want to put down.If secrets were left untold, I couldn't tell. These guys reveal things about themselves that you know they wish had never happened. After reading this book, I almost felt like I was part of the band.Highly recommended."
4,Walk This Way,Well written and an easy read. I liked the way the book lets you know who the speaker was per interview. I would recommend the book to all Aerosmith fans!
5,Aerosmith Forever,I am a hardcaore Aerosmith fan and thought I knew everything about the band. This book proved me wrong. Just reading it is an adventure. You seem to feel what the members of the band feel throughout their struggles and triumphs. I'll never find a book that beats this one!
2,Dino dino dino dino dino dino dino,Was my title annoying? Then you'll probably find this book annoying. I really disliked all these made up words. It was too repetitive. I actually hid these books so that I wouldn't have to read them again. My 4 year old wasn't that excited by them anyway.
2,Dinosailers Is Not A Good Buy!!,"My three year old son loves the Dinotrain, so I bought this book for him and assumed that we would love it. He wanted me to read this to him one night and so I did and now I wish I hadn't. This book is a cute idea, with the dinosaurs, the boat, the same cute rhyming text and the illustrations, until about half way through and I was shocked. The dinocrew heaves-ho (gets sick) all over the boat and what is worse, is it is illustrated too. It was gross. I didn't think is was funny, I just couldn't believe I saw this in a Children's book. I am sending this book back and the only reason I am giving it two stars, is because we liked the dinotrain so much."
2,ok,I bought this book after my 3YO loves the dino-train book. Dino-Sailors does not compare! The book was much more advanced... and I didn't care for the dinosaurs getting sea sick on the boat... My son didn't understand the book and I didn't care for it. However Dino-Train is great!
2,"Could have been cuter, why go for the gross factor?","I thought that dinosaurs and sailing would be a cute combination for my two year old and it's not an awful book but I think they do get a mite too technical on the sailing terminology. That would have been fine if they defined it or explained it better through pictures but they don't. The dino-repetition doesn't grate on me the way it seems to a lot of the other reviewers, it's part of the nature of childrens books. The main problem with it was the depiction of and references to vomiting. Yuck. I hate it every time I read it and then put the book away for several more weeks until I forget how much it bothers me. This would otherwise have been a three or four star book."
2,"Hard to read, pictures okay.","I wanted to enjoy this book, but it is clumsy to read, difficult for a young child to have any idea what you are reading about. I just started making up my own story line. I think it has a good idea, even the kids didn't seem that interested and stopped paying attention.it does have some sailing vocab in it. If you enjoy working on vocabulary and the pictures help explain some of the sailing termonology.My biggest problem with the book is it promotes the next book, ""dinotrainers"". I think it bothered me, because I wasn't enjoying reading this book so much and then it talks about the next adventure for the dinosaurs and I am thinking I don't want to read another one."
4,A Great Children's Book,"If your little ones loved ""Dinotrain"",they will enjoy this just as much! It has great pictures and of course lots of dino-rhyming! My children are 4 and 6 and love this story!"
3,Great Illustrations!,"My 3 yr. old daughter has been obsessed with dinosaurs for months now and we read just about every dinosaur picturebook we can get ahold of. This book has great pictures, but we have found some of the text too much for small kids. The authors uses too much technical sailing terminology. Some of the items mentioned in the text aren't familiar to my husband and I. Takes a bit of the fun out of the story when the child has no idea what the text means."
4,"Same video, different title.","Released in US as ""Dicover America"". Released in Canada under ""Babies on Board"" Both contain the the same episodes, so don't think your missing a tape from the collection."
5,Brite'n Your Day,"As a disc golfer, I first started using Brite-Mark paint pens to brighten my plastic discs and make them distinguishable from other players' discs. White markings also help locate discs in low-light playing conditions. This paint marker surpasses any I've used. Properly shaken when applied, the paint dries quickly after application and sustains rigorous use. I use this paint when wanting to brighten dark colored items that need to be seen in low-light conditions. I also like to mark the sides of electrical plugs to identify the side that has the larger of the two brass tips to minimize misalignment foreplay. In the future, I hope to acquire other colors which I hope will work equally well. End of story."
5,Really Good Book,This book is a really informative book of what the life of a Moonshiner is really like from someone who lived it first hand and is not afraid to tell the truth in his own way.It is one of the best books that I have ever read and if you are interested in moonshine history or just want to learn some information about how to make moonshine yourself it is definetely worth the money.
5,Great to have the copyright edition,"Published privately in 1999, an original script which targeted the public of the life and times of a moonshiner and an Appalachian man who was proud of his product and very private about his family which he purposely left out of his story. Popcorn was an intelligent man who was proud of his craft and had a very humorous way to recall his episodes with authorities. His life ended tragically in 2009 His book was extremely popular because of his creativity and marketing expertise. Read the book for information of a dying tradition."
5,Me and My Likker,"Popcorn Sutton is the ""real deal"". I had the unexpected pleasure of meeting Popcorn this past summer. He is an interesting and colorful gentleman. His book is written just as he speaks.... uncensored, informative, and colorful. It is probably as honest a look into a moonshiners life as you will ever find. This peek into the mountainman's world is a fun read and you will learn a thing or two as well!!"
5,Appalachian-American Cultural Literacy,"This book is a true, uncensored, raw sample of life in the mountain culture of Appalachia. One might also use it as technical manual with which to build a ""still"" and then perhaps, make a ""run."" Do not miss this experience- the next best thing to sitting with a mountain legend."
3,Overpriced,"This book is an interesting read, but there was only one column of print per page in a large font. If you are looking for hard information such as detailed recipes, how to build equipment or actual measurements of equipment, this is not the book for you. It is just a story of a few of the escapades of the moonshiner."

5,"Finally, their greatness captured live.","I have only seen My Morning Jacket play twice, once at Bonnaroo, and they are by far, in my opinion, the best live band in the world. I was hoping they would make a DVD so I can watch them play live whenever I want, and finally one day, after I was complaining to my girlfriend that they didn't have a live dvd, I saw on their website that they were going to release this. I bought the Okonokos live album as well, and while I loved it, the DVD sounds 2x better. Every instrument seems to stand out, and Jim James' vocals are outstanding. It's nice to see their almost mythical live performance ability finally caught on video so anybody can see it. I've watched this probably 5 times already, and I'm amazed every time at how great everything sounds.I'm seeing them this weekend in Indianapolis; can't wait. This is a band so good live, it's hard to get that excited about seeing any other band."
5,one of the greats,"seen em all, Last Waltz, Led Zeppelin, Monterey, Hard days Night, and put this at the top of the stack. a music enthusiast, I already consider this band one of the greatest of all time and this live DVD is a true testament to their brilliant live act. extremely well produced, with camera angles capturing the key moments of each of the musicians at their peak. if at all curious or have a friend who's told you to check em out, this is a great starting point."
1,Bad sound!,"This is a great concert, MMJ is awesome, but honestly, I have heard better sound on TV broadcsts of their shows. The compression is ridiculous, the bass can start a cut and as soon as the guitars kick in it all gets incredibly muddy and the top and bottom both disappear. It's a shame to take a beautiful effort by the artist and ruin it with bad mastering like this. I rechecked everything, switched D/A converters - no difference. Save your money or buy a CD and close your eyes."
1,Maybomberos and Paleros are turning in their graves,"This is probably worse than if you took some beautiful rolling stones classics and sang them as Opera. As a Mayombero of many years, who's sang these songs in rituals, and been to many toques, It's like nails on a chalk board. I'm sure someone out there might like it, but if you've heard the real thing, done in traditional style, there is no comparison. New age folks trying to blend, but it goes completely against the brash and gritty reality of the life of a Palo practitioner."
1,sauna suit,"I am not satisfied with the XL Everlast sauna suit that I bought. I was surprised at how skin-tight and confining it is, and the neck is so tight that it is almost choking, and while I DID buy it to use to sweat off weight, it's so tight that, unlike other XL sauna-suits that I have used that are roomy, it's actually uncomfortable to wear, so I haven't used it.If it were possible to exchange it for a 2XL or 3XL, I would be extremely grateful. If I am just stuck with the purchase, that would be regrettable.Thank you for contacting me for my opinion.Jim"
2,Ripped before the bill even came!,This suit works really good. It makes you sweat a lot!! but it ripped after it's 3rd use. I guess I wasn't careful enough while taking it off I didn't notice it was ripped until I got into the shower to wipe it down. it was ripped so badly on the butt area I had to throw the pants away. I guess I have to invest in a more expensive suit. If you don't have the money to buy a expensive suit then just be REALLY careful taking these pants off they will probably rip if you throw a fart! 0_o
3,Hard To Rate...,"This suit really works! The only reason I didn't rate it higher is because the neck is REALLY tight and the pants ripped on the 2nd use! So, I e-mailed amazon about the ripped pants and, LESS THAN AN HOUR after I contacted them, they replied to me. Apparently, they accidentally sent me a used suit. They are sending me a new one, should be here in 2 days. I highly recommend this suit, just hope you don't get a used one, lol."
1,Save your money and time!!! DO NOT BUY.,"This is my second purchase in Sauna suits, disappointed thus far. 2nd time using it pants ripped.shirts seems to be oh k, used it about 7 or 8 times so far, no problem.Over all Everlast makes well made products, but very disappointed on this purchase.rate 2/5 of five.Awesome service, speedy delivery,but Poor quality on merchandise."
1,Don't buy it!,"Received this suit, wore it the next day for the first time and it tore apart after one wearing. Also, it is super tight at neck!!! I hardly could brieth in it..."
2,Does what its suppose to.. just not build to last,"I'm one of those people that dont sweat a lot, but I sweated like race horse in this thing. Down side is the pants ripped the first time I used them..."
2,Buy a Valeo instead and save your money,Material of good quality. No pockets. Good body fit except for the neck area because the elastic absolutely strangles you to a point you really can't wear the suit as long as you'd like. Really ugly logo on back. Can't compare to Valeo. You would think these folks would know better with all the years they've been around.
3,Pants are Thin Material,"This is a great suit to sweat, but the material is very thin. The pants ripped after using them two times. When I work out now, I can only use the upper part; I will need to purchase another set from somewhere else. If you are running or working out with these pants, be aware that the material is very thin!"
1,Horrible...,"Okay, so my husband is losing weight for the Air Force, so i decided to help and i bought him this. It took a week to get here, and no longer than he put it on, it ripped from his crotch to his ankles. It did nothing whatsoever for his weight. Amazon did offer a full refund though, and i was very pleased with that. But, for this product, just save your money, and if you don't then just don't do any stretching."
2,"Top ok, pants ripped","The quality of the sauna suit is a lot better than the ones you see at sporting good stores. However, the pants ripped 2 weeks after getting it. So far no issues with the top"
5,Renewed Body,"I have purchased several Sauna Suits in the past, only to find them ripping after wearing them once or twice. The Everlast Suit mateial is strong, last a lot longer, and washes well. I do suggest you drink plenty of water so you do not get dehydrated. You will lose a lot of water weight, and then Praise God there goes the fat."
1,Not very Well Made,"The very first day I got the suit and put it on, I went to take my daily walk and the pants tore in the crotch the material feels kind of flimsy to me. I can't say I would purchase this product again."
2,Sauna Suite,Didn't really care for this item. It seemed to work ok but the neckline on the shirt is way to tight. Felt like I was choking all the time. The rest of it was fine
3,They don't make em' like they used to,The very first time I walked in the suit it ripped in the seam up the back. I'm not blaming Amazon but Everlast didn't last.
3,"Was working good for first 2 uses, then the pant ripped apart","Pros:looks quite sturdy,you sweat tons when wearing itkeep you warmcons:not as sturdy as i expected (ripped after 3rd uses, maybe from some stretching pose?)size is really big (i normally wear 6#, and the medium looks giant on me)extras: yes, it smells...but not that strong after a whilei wish it can be more a jacket style, the band around neck is way to tight"
3,Not as durable as you might expect,"It was not a one piece upper body and lower body suit. It had seams which ripped on me after my first use. They replaced it with a new one. You need to be VERY careful putting on and off and I would recommend putting on a nylon shirt underneath it to aid in putting on and taking off. Of course, by doing such, you will sweat a whole lot more, but that is the purpose of the product. For a product named Everlast, it should be much more durable. I have been using it for my last two or three bike routines without issue. Be careful when using. It does its job."
3,cumple con sus funciones pero se daña facil,"primero se me daño el pantalón en la parte de la entre pierna se hizo un huequito y se desgarro todo, ahora se me rompió el caucho del cuello y ya no me ajusta, y también me di cuenta que se me hizo otro hueco en la parte de las axilas me imagino que también se va a desgarrar. cumple con su función, sudas muchísimo es impresionante y te mantiene caliente."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,Size was not as described! Way to small. Very disappointed. I thought this item would be of better quality vs those sold at Walmart. Not true!
1,Don't bother with this!,The neck is tight and I felt chocked wearing it even though it did make me sweat. It ripped withing 10 seconds of wearing it!
3,it works really well but it has some issues,"I bought this and used it, after 30 mins I was dripping sweat through the suit like a fosset!the things I don't like about this are that it's not machine washable and you can't dry it on the dryer.you have to rinse after EVERY workout and hang it -in my case- on the shower and let it drip dry.the other thing that I hate is that the neck elastic, literally chokes me, it's too tight! and I'm only 200lbs it's not like I'm some huge guy that doesn't fit in it. I have to pull the elastic away to stop me it from choking me, it's really uncomfortable.keep in mind that if you lose weight with this is just water weight, so don't fool yourselves once you get on the scale and yousee you've lost 5 lbs in a few days."
2,not what expected,"the suit does the work the problem comes when you want to take it off and you are all sweaty, the suit gets pretty sticky, the jacket is delicate and when you exercise for a long time you wont be gently when you will try to pull it off... I have broken two pbc jackets already, but I have to admit ""the suit makes you sweat""."
1,Everlast PVC Sauna Suit (Sports),"First time wearing the thing and the seat of the pants ripped within 10-15 minutes of light stretching, nothing strenuous or far reaching at all.I suddenly felt inside air blowing past my legs while wearing the suit, sure enough, big ole split in the back. The top is holdingup fine after several uses though. Yet and still, 1 star."
1,"Should be ""Excellent Liberal Catholic Parishes""","Mr. Wilkes, also the author of The Good Enough Catholic, presents examples of parishes that he and other Liberal, dissenting types would champion as beacons of Catholic-lite. One example is Christ The King in Las Vegas.The church has no kneelers, so nobody kneels. The Tabenacle which houses our Lord's body has been shuntedoff to a side chapel! Pita bread is used for Communion and,if you walked in to the Church, you'd never guess it was a Catholic Church. There is nothing adorning it's walls. No Stations of the Cross, no nothing. Not real orthodox stuff.Word of mouth and trial and error are better guides."
5,Great pen for the money,This pen looks great and always receives comments. It is quite thick which makes writing easy for me as opposed to the old Cross pens.
5,It Works!,"This is so easy and gives *fast* results. I thought my jeans felt looser after 2 days on the eating plan. I dug out my tape measure fully expecting to be disappointed - no so! I had lost a combined total of 5(!) inches in 2 days! (Chest, waist, hips, thighs). I never feel hungry or deprived and am full of energy."
3,3 stars just for her recipes,"I've tried her diet plan years ago, but, as always with dissociated diets, I was constantly hungry and because of it I overate, she's right about fat but she's not at all about using fat free milk and yogurt (this two aspects in reality contradict each other) and fructose which increases tryglicerydes, but her recipes, using full fat products and sugar instead of fructose, or her later produced sweetener, are delicious. I'm giving 3 stars just for them, for the real french diet I suggest the fat fallacy or other books about the so called french paradox, because in France they eat a slice of bread with their cheese....."
4,Wish you had frozen meals for busy working people,"I love the idea and just started trying the plan last week, however living here in Ohio makes it difficult to get some of those wonderful veggies that are in the recipes. I wish she would come out with some frozen meals for the people work and attend school full time with no extra time to cookk those delicious meals."
4,I find I'm getting headaches,"I really enjoyed reading Suzanne's book. I've been on her plan for 2 weeks now and have lost 3 lbs. I have one little problem or possibly big problem. I have had headaches daily and dizziness. It really doesn't feel normal. I would like to know more about the food combinations of eating. What kind of side affects do you get with ""Ketosis"", too much protein? I have read""Fit for Life"" and ""The Zone"" Each book has different views. One says to eat breads with your proteins and the other says to eat fruit with meals. Which is it? Am I starving my body? They both have fat in their diets but not unlimited like yours. Please give me so medical advise. I am a very healthy person but approx. 20lbs. overweight. If anyone, preferrable a M.D. can give me some medical advise I would appreciate it. Also I was wondering if Suzanne Somers and Dr. D. Schwarzbein have an e-mail address. Hope to continue the eating plan."
2,Disappointed,"I only had 10 pounds to lose and thought Somersizing would be the way to go. By the end of the first week, after following the diet to the letter, I had gained 5 lbs! As soon as I switched over to Dr Atkins diet, within 2 weeks I had not only lost the 5 lbs, but an extra 8 lbs. In total I have now lost 17 lbs on the Atkins Diet and would not dream of eating all the carbohydrates that the Somersizing plan tells you to eat. I believe her plan is strictly for people who have 50 or more pounds to lose, but for those of us who want to lose a quick 10, Dr. Atkins is the way to go."
1,A healthy vegetarian's nightmare.,"I appreciate the information about fat and her advise about not being afraid of food but I can't buy her support for meat and dairy especially the bacon and eggs cholesterol reducing theory. I think she should be using her celeb status to promote healthy beautiful delicious alternatives, that yes, may have small amounts of fat (in accordance with a portion of her theory) but yet would have even better cholesterol reducing benefits, aid in diabetes maintenance, help the environment, and be rooted in compassion instead of complete self gratification.Sounds like something ""Chrissie"" would have written."
5,Eating to help others,"I love this book. It's delicious. I'm so glad that it came out and now that I practice what it says, I have truly seen dramatic results in my life.I enthusiastically recommend that you read this book because it can not only help you to loose weight but perhaps, just like it did with me, it can help you to gain the confidence to be the best you that you can be."
2,Another Been There Done That Book,"I read a friend's copy and it's like rereading Dr. Atkins book about high protein, low carboydrate foods.I tried Dr. Atkins diet, ala Suzanne Sommers' book, and as one reader commented....it's very hard and probably not healthy to cut out all sugar and nearly all carbos."
4,The book is very motivational- I hope it works !!,"The book leaves a couple of questions unanswered, such as:What do you drink besides water? What does she suggest putting on toast/bagels:Jam? What about non-fat yogurt- do you want to eat plain yogurt only or is fruited non-fat yogurt OK? I think that the plan could be a good one !!"
5,Content and concept are reasonable,"I enjoyed reading the book and learning about the concepts of food combining, metabolism and appetite satisfaction. The content of the book and its author makes for very believable reading. I am comfortable with this way of changing my eating habits; it's no hassle. I believe however, that I should lose more weight so I will stay with the program. I would like to know why it is not working for me as well as it should. What could I be doing wrong? Goodbye funky foods forever. I pretend I am allergic!"
4,It could be a winner,"I started sommersizing about a week ago. I haven't weighed yet, but I feel as though I've lost. I probably could lose more if I would stop cheating. I'm not crazy about vegetables. I like okra and squash, but they have to be breaded which is a no-no on Level One. Could someone give me suggestions? I think though if I really stuck with it, this diet could be the one to change my life. I've been constantly depressed about my weight ever since the birth of our daughter. My husband thinks I'm crazy. But we are about to move back to Hawaii and I don't want to be fat the second time around. We lived there about 3 years ago and I didn't like going to the beach. Could anyone help me on recipes for this plan? Suzanne's recipes are a little too extreme for me."
5,Easy reading -- great food -- logical thinking,"I honestly can't believe I'm advocating Suzanne Somers, but I saw her on Larry King Live and was so impressed by her actual persona that I had to buy her books. I've never believed the hype against good food that people have been enjoying for centuries, so her focus on sugar (and away from fat) sold me. And her thoughts are right -- I've never felt better. I've slowed down on my sugar intake, I've begun to monitor how I combine my food, and now all I have to do is that darn exercise stuff and I'll be set. Aargh!"
3,Good for the Short Run,"I had lost about 18 lbs, without exercising, most post-baby weight. But I did hit a wall and stopped losing weight. I missed stuff like a turkey sandwich, bananas and white pasta.The cookbook portion has some great recipes, but some ingredients are expensive and they do require a LOT of prep work. It does introduce you to some great new foods and spices, but tough to continue in the long run."
3,Go Striaght to the source,"I have read this book, but I have also read the swarzbein principal, (the book this one was based on) and I deem it to be better. My whole family has gotten thinner on the swarzbein principal from my cooking, even my kids have gotten skinnier. I think Suzanne Somers did a great job, but Diana Swarzbein is a doctor. My advice to you all is to go straight to the source, Diana Swarzbein wrote a great book, and the world would look great if they read it!"
3,Not for the Snackaholic,"I love Suzanne and lost over 20 pounds with her books. Unfortunately, I continue to lose the same 20+ pounds over, and over, again. Why? Because it doesn't allow for snacking on sugary products which most of us are addicted to.On her program, I lose 4 or 5 pounds in a week. That sounds like a miracle but it isn't. Why? Because during that weekend I'll eat something I shouldn't, and all, or almost all, the weight I lost during that week will mysteriously return overnight. I know it's my own fault because I shouldn't have had the piece of Chocolate Mousse Cake from the Cheesecake Factory.Finally, I have come to the conclusion that I am not losing fat on this diet, but water weight. That's the only explanation I can come up with since so much of the weight comes back overnight.If anyone has any info for me regarding exciting snacks I can eat on this program and not put back on the weight, let me know. Sorry, Suzanne, but I still love you, anyway."
2,"Well written and convincing, but not very feasible.","I have seen this diet work well for a friend of mine. In fact, I lost 4 pounds the first week using her plan. However, I found the plan almost impossible to follow when traveling. Imagine never being able to eat a sandwich with meat! I found that I had to cook almost every meal. I love to cook, but that was too much. I think I'll stick with Weight Watchers."
3,Very interesting but confusing,"I bought this book immediately after watching Ms. Somers on the Larry King Live show. It's a neat book, but I'm having a very hard time integrating my mostly vegan diet and my soy liquids I must drink instead of dairy products. Ms. Somers does not offer suggestions how to work around these hurdles. Most of her recipes are expensive and it's difficult to procure some of the ingredients here in the midwest. Instead of losing weight, I've gained two pounds!"
1,"If you watched Three's Company, you already know enough","How anyone can believe this amazes me, but that is the mentality of those who will watch the shopping channel and think Suzanne Somers has some magical potion. Let these people review the book a year after reading it and we'll see if they still like it."
1,Nutrition misinformation at its worst!,"Ms. Somers and company are sadly misinformed on the science of weight loss and the art of healthy eating! Another fad diet book, sure to result in regained pounds and disappointed customers."
1,Potentially dangerous diet!!,"This low-carb, high fat and protein diet is once again making the rounds now disguised as a NEW phenomena. Yes, you will lose weight but youre putting your kidneys at risk from protein overload, youre losing water and thus minerals and in the long run forever changing your metabolism. I can almost guarantee that if you go off this ""REVOLUTIONARY"" diet, the pounds will pile on fast and furious. What about fiber? What about VARIETY AND MODERATION? It is, in the long run, THE ONLY WAY to maintain a good weight for your body...this diet is a nephrologists nightmare and an almost sure way to screw up your body. Better to reduce portion size, keep an exercise regimen and learnto love the body God blessed you with!!"
2,Suzanne Somers is giving middle aged women false hope,"Suzanne Somers is partial scam artist. She claims that if you follow the advice in her books, prepare her recipes, use her skin products, etc. you can look as good as she does for her age. She never mentions all the cosmetic surgery and lipo suction she has had done. I know a number of Plastic Surgeons and Dermatologists, and they all claim that there is no way that her face and body can look as good as it does for her age without Cosmetic Surgery on her face and body and touch-ups along the way. However, her books with their beautiful pictures of her and her recipes are lovely to look at but she is giving women who are in their 50's and beyond false hope. She should really write a book about all the work she has had done, what it was like, the cost (which the average woman cannot afford), etc."
4,Great Info,"I had tried Atkins before however felt that it was time consuming figuring out carbs and phases. This is more straightforward, focuses on food combining. Great recipes too! Plus, look at her she is obviously doing something right!"
3,Write a Follow Up,"I found the book interesting and educational. However, I am of a lower income bracket and feel Suzanne should write a follow up book that contains recipes for the majority. Recipes that are simplified and prepared in as least amount of time as possible,as most moms are rushed when they arrive home from work. I'd like to see more practical, down to earth recipes for dinner time. Need simple dessert recipes also. Suzanne did a good job, but I feel the book relates more to a persons lifestyle who can afford a live-in cook and personal trainer. How about us who are the cook, maid, self aerobics teacher and chief bottle washer?"
5,"Great philosophy, great recipes, feel great-but slow loss.","I really do like the diet. I've been on it for almost five weeks and I find it easy to follow - excellent food!...but I have only lost TWO pounds and I'm wondering what I could do differently. I am 46, 5'4"", and only want to lose 15 pounds - I weighed 150 and after five weeks, I weigh 148!? I haven't cheated and I want to continue the regimen!..but I would love to see some better results. All the reviews I have read sound so positive and seem to work much faster."
3,great food,"The recipes in this book are great. To the two below wondering about why it's not working fast enough, she does say in the book it can take a few months before you start to see results. Just be patient."
4,Works for me!,"I lost 10 pounds in 2 1/2 weeks and had to move to Level 2 tostop losing so fast! Imagine--cheese as a snack! I miss pasta withmeat sauce, but its well worth the results. The recipes are too complicated and expensive, but just watch how you combine foods and it works!"
2,SORRY TO BE A BUMMER-,"I bought her last book and really this ""new"" book is almost exactly the same, give or take a few recipes. You may just want to keep the first book and save your cash. Also, I was really disappointed that Suzanne didn't try to add some quick and easy recipes for those of us who don't have a grill on our deck and the luxury of time to prepare. I know that her plan works, but its restrictions are maddening and her recipes are awfully elaborate for the average person. Especially giving up carrots and caffeine! Ouch! How do we know that this isn't just a FAD? Sorry to be the skeptic, but really!"
5,The Best Eating Plan I've Ever Tried!,"The ""Somersizing"" way of eating has been workingincredibly for me. I started Sept 30/99 and so far I've lost 24 lbs!And believe me, I haven't been perfect, there's been times I've allowed myself little treats along the way. The most amazing thing is that I don't crave certain things like I used to. I can let myself have a little treat here and there and still get right back on the plan. In the past it was always a struggle to get back on track. And my energy is way up there ... I used to think it was eating fat that made me feel sluggish, but when I cut back the carbs and was still eating some fat, I realized it was the carbs making me feel so tired. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone trying to lose weight ... it's fabulous!"
1,IT CAUSES KIDNEY DAMAGE AND BAD BREATH,"Waste of money and waste of my poor kidney thank's to a superficial ""movie star"" who is not even a professional in the nutrition field."
2,Not everyone is meant to be a carnivore!,Not everyone can metabolize and digest meat and dairy products. I followed this diet and actually gained weight! I knew something was wrong because I excercise 5 days a week and only had a few pounds to lose. What I discovered is I cannot eat dairy products and meat too frequently or it will get stored as fat. Now I am eating high fiber carbohydrate foods and mostly vegetarian fare and the pounds are melting off! Some people LOSE weight eating mostly carbohydrates (high in fiber) and I am one of them.
1,Didn't work for me,"I stayed on this diet for over a month. It did not work for me. Can we really expect a diet to be healthy if we eat a lot of fat? I finally decided to use common sense and eat small portions of all food groups. That way I get the minerals and vitamins I need. And exercise is key. After ending this diet, I adjusted my eating schedule and portions and have lost the weight. And it all goes back to sensible eating - we know when we are eating foods high in fat and calories. Don't deny these foods, eat them every now and then to satisfy your cravings. Don't eat late at night. Exercise at least three times per week (I exercise at least 5 days per week). I have been addicted to food for a long time. I would eat when I'm happy, sad, bored, etc. In order for me to keep the weight off - a lifelong task, I must realize what the problem is (why I eat) instead of what I eat."
4,Need Help,"I think this diet sounds great, but I can't seem to stick to it. The thing is I'm not a big veggie eater. The veggies I do like are okra and squash and I need them breaded when I eat them. I know people probably are saying you just haven't given yourself a chance, but believe me I have been trying all kinds of new veggies. I still don't have a taste for them. My problem is that there is not much I can eat at a meal because I'm tired of salad with everything. I'm constantly depressed because I've been struggling with losing 15-20 pounds since I gave birth years ago. I've tried everything. I do aerobics and I've been running a little with my husband, but that just isn't enough. Please can someone help me out and give me some suggestions for somersizing!"
4,Looks good to me!,I'm still in the process of reading this book and it sounds great! I have to admit though I'm a little confused about what to eat with what...so am I confused about everything in the book? Any help would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to trying this book - I had tried the Atkins diet before but he even restricted fruit - which I need to satisfy my sweet tooth so hopefully this will work! Thanks in advance for any tips or suggestions!
4,hmm,Well this one was kind of old school animation but if you can get over that and the occasional weakness in the plot it has lots of intrigue and action and stuff. Not quite as funny as some of the other Lupin movies but thats just my opinion. No nudity was a plus.
1,another piece of junk,"This is another piece of junk. Unfortunately I bought two of these. This line of products does not have a wood frame. Instead, the entire body is made of paper. I wonder how long it will last in a bathroom.The seller shall stop selling such piece of junk."
2,boppy is too small and too soft/flat,"This pillow is too small, I am 5'7"" and it doesn't really do anything for my belly. I still have to use 3 other conventional pillows to get comfortable. This may work if you are 5' and under. Its also too soft and and falls flat easily(no support)."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS PILLOW,"I bought this pillow as I have a bad lower back and being pregnant has made sleeping uncomfortable. This pillow is the LOWEST quality pillow I have EVER used. The filling is loose and the pillow does not keep it shape. It is very hard to ""fluff"" the pillow for use each night as it does not even distribute the filling. I HIGHLY recommend a regular well made body pillow if you are accustomed to higher quality pillow. I had really high hopes and was very disappointed."
4,"Good, but not great","I bought this pillow to use with my first pregnancy. I used it a few months and stored it. I used it for another few months when I had my second pregnancy. When I pulled it out for my 3rd, there was no more stuffing in the knee area. :( A friend suggested a Luna Lullaby nursing pillow instead, as it could be used for sleeping AND nursing and has a soft minkee cover. While this is a little cheaper, the versatility and added comfort of the luna lullaby makes this pillow a far second."
3,it is okay....,"I bought this pillow early on in my pregnancy. Although it continues to help me (I am 26 weeks now), and I still sleep with it, the stuffing has started to separate, especially in the part that goes between the legs. Also, the pillow is not long enough, I have to use an additional pillow to put my arms around and cuddle with."
4,Good idea,"This would work very nicely for me if it was a little smaller. I'm about 5' 4"" and the pillow is a little to big for me. But the shape of the pillow makes it easy to place between the knees and under the belly."
2,too big,"well, I tried and thought it was too big. It does not get soft and the bigger end stays too tough so I found it quiet uncomfortable. I am actually returning it. I am at the beginning of my 6th and I weigh 119 pounds. Maybe I am just not heavy enough ?? but still."
4,love it,"i bought this pillow when i was newly pregnant in early 2007, it helped me sleep comfortably through my pregnancy , the stuffing would gather together at one end but i just gave it a shake and it was fine. i'm looking to replace my old one now since the stuffing has seperated and it doesn't feel as comfortable. but i think i got my money's worth since i have been using it for 2 1/2 years."
5,Very comfortable,"I had back pain already in the second trimester of my pregnancy, but as soon as I started using this pillow the pain went away. Due to the slightly different position the back is straighter while sleeping. Now that my belly is biger, the pillow gives a bit of support, too. I do not know yet, if the pillow is good for nursing, but I am looking forward to try. This pillow definitely helps improve the sleep during pregnancy."
2,Falls flat...literally,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my pregnant wife. At first, like many reviewers, she loved it, but as time went by it fell flat...literally. The pillow is filled with cotton fill, the kind you would buy at a department store if you were going to make a decorative throw pillow. This means the pillow falls flat and gets divots where there is constant pressure. My wife is petite so she is not wearing the pillow down, it is just poorly made. Not really worth the money, but it is a nice alternative to the larger pillows. My wife did like it before it fell flat and she does still use it from time to time."
1,Worthless!!!,I was in my 3rd trimester when I ordered this. I started to get leg pains from having to lay on my side all of the time. My chiropractor recommended using something like this to support my stomach and my legs. This pillow was worthless. It did not help with the pain at all. It was too flat between my legs. It did no more for me than a $5 pillow did. I returned it and would not recommend spending $30 on this pillow.
5,I Love it!,"When I was 5 months pregnant I was having a hard time sleeping, until I purchased this boppy! I absolutely fell in love with it! Sorry to say but I completely forgot about my hubby sleeping next to me once I got this (LoL!). I slept so much better and I even took it with me when we went on vacation to the Dominican Republic. Now my son is four months and I still use it for him. I use it as a pillow to rest him on while he eats. So he and I are both comfy. My only complaint is I can't find another slip cover."
5,boppy pregnancy pillow,I love the Boppy pregnancy pillow. It relieves the pressure between the knees while holding up your belly at the same time.
2,Dissappointed,"I bought this pillow at about 11 weeks, right when the sleeplessness started. I've used it every night since then. I'm 13 weeks now. The stuffing has a lot to be desired. It has separated and is lumpy right where you need stuffing, specifically the portion that goes between the legs. It is supposed to keep the knees seperated to take pressure off the lower back, but since the stuffing has seperated, it no longer has that effect. I will be going back to a regular bed pillow after using this product onlt 2 1/2 weeks."
5,Love it.,"I have used this pillow since the beginning of my pregnancy and it is wonderful. No problems with the stuffing becoming lumpy or mis-shapen. Great for releaving hip pain and as a stomach sleeper, it allows you to sleep on your side with similar comfort to stomach sleeping by leaning into the pillow. I highly recommend it."
4,Great Boppy pillow,It was very comfortable and easy to use. The only downside was that it didn't keep it's fluffiness like I had hoped. I am small (about 5'1) so this pillow was much easier to use than the full body pillows that are out there. I would highly recommend this pillow.
4,relief,"Although this pillow did not keep it's shape as well as I would have liked, it helped me get sleep when nothing else would! I would not have wanted to go through the last few months without it. I tried everything I could think of before finding this and it really did help me sleep better. I would definitely recommend it."
3,Not quite what I was expecting...,"I was really looking forward to this pillow, as I am currently about 5 1/2 months along, and have been having a lot of discomfort trying to sleep. I wanted a pillow that would go between my knees, and also hold my belly up a bit, so that my back didn't hurt so much.It did help with these two problems, but the pillow has some issues of its own. As other reviewers have said, there seems to be an excess of stuffing at the top of the pillow. It takes up a lot of space in the bed, and makes turning over cumbersome when you have anything more than a sheet covering you (as a heavy blanket holds it down). So while I am more comfortable while asleep, I wake up every time I want to turn to my other side. It seems like the pillow would be a lot better if the top part were more narrow."
2,Does not allow date inputing,"While this is a nice printing calculator it did not have the ""Time/Date Feature"" mentioned in the description.For that reason, I had to return this item. Too bad....."
1,"Great til it breaks, and it will","The design was great. I liked the functionality and interface with the exception of the camera turning on randomly in my pocket. About three months with it though, the face cracked (apparently a common problem with this phone). It did not affect the function of the phone and I used it for another three months. Without dropping it, sticking it in water or any other normal reason, the phone died on me. Luckily for the manufacturer, they don't have to replace it because the crack in the face excuses them. Smart on their part to design a flimsy face so that when their phone does die they can blame it on that, and you are SOL."
4,Great basic phone,"I've had two of these phones, one red one charcoal, and the only problem I've had with them is that my 90 year old mother has lost them both. I am ready to buy another one right now. It is a good basic phone with large buttons and easy to read type, even my mother can use it and read it with no problem.The camera is a bit sensitive, but it is easy to get out of, I can't believe someone thought they had to take a picture.Volume is decent for a thin phone and reception is at least average. I get no more drop outs or call problems than with any other phone I have ever owned.The photo quality is not all that great but I very seldom use it anyway.They both held up well .I really do not have anything negative to say about it."
3,SORRY--BUT--I'M NOT IRISH,"THIS IS ABOUT MY SIXTH CHRISTMAS BOOK THIS YEAR---AND---IT WAS A VERY NICE BOOK.A VERY, VERY LOT OF IT WAS LOST ON ME---BECAUSE---I'M NOT IRISH!! THE IRISH REFERENCES WERE LOST--I'M SORRY TO SAY. BUT--I WILL PASS THIS BOOK ON TOAN IRISH FREIND OF MINE WHO WILL LOVE IT."
2,"It works, but it is not stereo.",This unit looks good and sounds okay but I was not impressed with the amount of power for the wattage rating that it gives. I do not know why it says stereo. There is not any pan controls even though it is listed as a feature. The only stereo input is the Aux RCA input and it combines it into mono however the EQ does effect the channels separately. The digital effect is a one decent preset of echo with reverb. This unit died after 3 outings powering 4 ohm loads. There are no internal fuses that I can find. I will find out how good NADY warranties are next.
1,If you are a begginer DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"I have bought this book as a gift to a friend who can be consiedered a ""begginer"". He did not like /understand the book, and to my worst, I had to explain him things thatwere bad or mistakenly explained in it.It has many errors, to my knowledge"
5,Best case todate!,"This is the best case I have purchased todate and I have been building my own computers for over 20 years.Great cooling system, two fans on each end that aren't too loud.Chassis slides out (4 thumb bolts) to easliy put in your motherboard.All cables are labeled clearly.Covers come on and off easily with 1 large thumb bolts.Great size 15 inches deep x 11 inches wide by 9 1/2 inches tall.So far I have this one in blue and another one in black.One problem - beware of third party heatsinks/fans. They may not fit as this is a micro atx case not a tower."
1,Cliff Notes Version,"This version was awfully butchered. It felt like I was fast-forwarding through the entire novel. The actors were fine, but the dialogue they were given was so trite that I found myself wincing through most of it. The script lost a lot of the novel's ""punch"" and intensity. This DVD is definitely going into the Salvation Army bin. I couldn't sit through it again.My favorite version of Jane Eyre is still the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton - good dialogue, fine acting, and great film score, plus at 311 minutes the original story remains pretty much in tact.I also love Timothy Dalton's version of Wuthering Heights - never a dry eye at the end of that one. Beautiful, haunting film score."
5,EXCELLENT!!,"The A&E version far outshines all the other versions ever made. The characters are passionate and carry the story out beautifully & elegantly. Closest thing to the novel..LOVED IT, LOVED IT!! If your a romantic buff and adore Bronte's Jane Eyre, you have to see this it's worth every penny!"
2,Nothing compared to the Orson Wells version,"This was a drab, nothing little piece of a movie.Why even try to capture the beauty of the original when you can do it so boringly in color?Yuck."
4,One of the best versions I have seen,"I disagree with the viewer from Cambrige Ontario. I found this version lovely! Samantha Morton was excellent (I need to see ""Emma"" now), reserved, thoughtful, just as Jane was in the book. Jane had high emotions but did not strike out often...the childhood was a small part of the book, and though important, it is not the major part of the story. The relationship with Bessie and Helen and Mrs Reed are important as well. I found this version to be just fine, and I am going to buy it!"
5,A wonderful adaptation,"This is a wonderful adaptation of a great book. The actors are amazing and the story is one of the best ever written. This is a story about passion, love conquering all, and is full of strong, well-developed, and wonderful characters. Watching it feels like you are a part of the story, and it is a masterpiece."
2,What a pity...,"I read the book and adored it. I decided to purchase the film (this version being the only one I was familiar with). What a mistake. Although the role of Jane is redeamable, Mr. Rochester is overplayed; he is total gruff and grumble; absent being his redeaming qualities so well portrayed in the novel. They cut out such important parts of the book; Jane's disturbed childhood was a mere footnote. All of the novel's Gothic flavour is watered-down entirely. I had such high hopes. Stay away from this version, or, if intent upon viewing this, please read the book first so this film doesn't put you off it."
2,"Jane Eyre (A&E, 1997)","Not a great version. Both Jane and Edward come off as angry and hard instead of the sympathy inspiring characters they are in the book. The Timothy Dalton version is much better and truer not only to the book, but to the spirit of the book. Jane does not leave Thornfield because of her pride as intimated in this version, she leaves because it would be morally wrong to stay. The whole book is about doing the right thing despite the main character's own personal desires. That in the end is what brings her happiness. Check out the other version before you buy this one."
3,Great Jane...Terrible Rochester,"As a Jane Eyre fan, I've seen most of the film versions of the classic novel. No single film fully meets my expectations, but this is, I think, the best appearance of a Jane I have seen. This Jane Eyre (portrayed by Samantha Morton) is strong, yet not overbearing; she has humor, yet is serious, too. She even looks right for the role. Ms. Morton knows her character and gives us a richly layered and detailed Jane Eyre.Sadly, other aspects of this film are less gratifying. In particular, the actor portraying Mr. Rochester gives one of the worst performances of a Rochester I have ever seen. He's so hotheaded and violent it's difficult to see what positive traits Jane sees in him. This is no sardonic hero.Still, if you want to enjoy a great performance by Samantha Morton as Jane Eyre, this film is worth watching."
2,It's Okay If You Don't Love the Book,"While this production is worth renting, it is not faithful to the book because of its omissions, and I found Ciaran Hinds to be a very unsatisfactory Mr. Rochester. The script highlighted his unsavory features (he is a deceiving adulterer, after all) to such an extent that his romantic and heroic qualities were insufficient to overcome the detriment to his character and likeability. In the book, his evil deeds are swept away by the force of his personality and the depth of his love. I also felt that while Timothy Dalton looked too young in the part, Ciaran Hinds looked too old and a bit worse for wear. The Timothy Dalton version is the most satisfying in terms of completion of plot. It is indeed straight from the book, as someone noted, and what a book it is! I think it takes quite some nerve to edit Charlotte Bronte to this extent."
3,Somewhat Shameful,"I am a firm believer that one should not judge a movie too harshly based on the book from which it came. I fully understand that it is very difficult to fit a 400 page book into a 2-hour slot. Plot adjustments will always have to be made. One thing that I cannot stand, however, is misrepresentation of characters. While this version (A&E's) of ""Jane Eyre"" sticks to the basic plot, much better than the William Hurt version does, the screenwriters got the characters all wrong. In this version, Jane is much too forceful; she never would have spoken rudely to her employer as she does in this movie. She could barely look him in the eye, much less call him a liar to his face, as she basically does.After seeing A&E's ""Pride and Prejudice,"" which was absolutley wonderful, I really would have expected more from them. Shame on you, A&E!"
5,Great love story,"Wonderful. I loved the book since I was a child and when i saw version of Jane Eyre with Timothy Dalton, I didn't think anything could top that. However, this one is fabulous as well. Ciaran Hinds is perfect as Mr. Rochester. After seeing this movie I became a big fan of his. If you like good love stories this is a must see."
1,Extremely disappointed,"Ciaran Hinds, one of my favorite actors, portrayed Rochester as a hysterical bully.I was amazed that Jane, a sensible girl, would find anything admirable or lovable about the character."
2,A&E does it again?,I am most certain that the dvd release is an A&E abridged version; which they usually broadcast in their reruns and for their Classroom series. There is a more complete version which had originally aired encompassing Jane's school experiences. I'd guess that approximately 30-45 minutes of material are missing from the beginning of the story and was replaced with quickly edited scenes with a voice-over. I've heard this before about other A&E releases I just wish the official description would clarify...I would not have purchased it if I knew this was the case.
4,Excellent Jane and Rochester,"A finely cast Jane (an early role for Samantha Morton) and Rochester (a gruff, wry Ciaran Hinds) make the difference in what is quite a short retelling of the story. In particular, the verbal fencing that goes on as they sound each other out in the early part of the film - an important element in the book - is played expertly. The 2006 version (Ruth Wilson) has more time to develop detail and a first-class Jane, but perhaps too civilised a Rochester."
1,"Other than the leading actress, this version is awful!","She's the only good aspect of this rendition. Considering that there are so many other versions of this amazing story to enjoy DO NOT waste your time on this one. I'm not the type to lean on the melodramatic, I really am serious about how poopy I thought this version is."
4,A loose version but my favorite,"This is a loose version, some things were added that were not in the book, much was left out. but a book such as this would have to be a mini-series to remain true. That being said, I like this version. Ciran Hinds never disappoints, and is so handsome. Yes he's stiff in the movie, but so was Edward in the book. I like it, and will probably buy this version, maybe. still a couple more versions to see before I select one for my personal library."
4,Very Romantic ; A Joy to Watch,I can honestly say I really LOVED this version. Morton and Hinds are wonderful. I have watched it several times and it is truely ROMANTIC. It is just a bit too short. I would have like to have seen more of the story line.
1,Terrible rendition,"If you've seen the 1983 version on VHS with Timothy Dalton as Rochester (or read the book), you will be very disappointed with this version. Several crucial parts of the story are left out completely, such as Jane learning that she has been left a sizeable inheritance. Also, Rochester is overacted, and the growth of the relationship between he and Jane is unconvincing. I bought this because it was on DVD, and wish I hadn't. I'll wait for the 1983 version to be put on DVD."
3,Not The Best,"On a scale of 1-10, this Jane Eyre is a 5, maybe 6.While Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton are talented performers, this version is just overall lacking. Ciaran Hinds come off as a little too brutish for my taste and certain parts are rushed through.While one cannot expect a 2 hour movie to encompass every detail of a novel, it is expected that the production team keeps to original novel to a certain degree, which is not the case with this one.A better JE is the 1974 Michael Jayston/Sorcha Cusick JE, the 1983 Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clark JE or even the 2006 Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson JE."
3,Samantha Morton's acting ability,"I have this version of ""Jane Eyre"" on VHS, and I like it, but can't understand all words, which is why I'm wanting it on DVD. I agree with one reviewer who disliked Ciaran Hinds' overacting as Mr. Rochester. However, I'm interested in this version because of him, and Samantha Morton.Samantha is amazing to me here, as she, if you can believe it, also plays timid little Harriet Smith in Jane Austen's ""Emma"" (A&E; version). What a difference in personality and character!! And so convincing!And Ciaran Hinds plays Wentworth in Jane Austen's ""Persuasion"" with Amanda Root as Anne, and of course, he's nothing like Mr. Rochester.Both ""Emma"" and ""Persuasion"" mentioned above have sub-titles. I haven't checked yet to see if this version on DVD of ""Jane Eyre"" offers sub-titles, but if it doesn't, I'll be terribly disappointed, and will not purchase it."
1,Not even close !!!,"This version of Jane Eyre is absolutely disappointing. It is not faithful to the novel and the acting is horrible. There is no chemistry between Samantha Morton and Ciran Hinds and the emotions they supposedly ""tried"" to embody are so watered down that it is just embarrassing. The best version of Jane Eyre is the one with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton. Do not waste you time and money on this. Not recommended at all !"
4,LOVED it!,"I read Jane Eyre in high school and again recently, and out of curiosity wanted to see a film adaptation. I did a lot of research in finding the ""right"" film to see, and though this is the only one I HAVE seen, I thoroughly enjoyed it. As all adaptations to film must leave out certain details for time purposes, I felt that this particular ""book to movie"" was done wonderfully. I would highly recommend watching this movie to get a close to accurate storyline of the novel. The actors/actresses were great and I absolutely enjoyed it!"
2,I already reviewed this but forgot to adjust the star rating,"I already submitted a review, but forgot to adjust the star rating. So my tepid review has five stars -- very confusing. Please correct! Thanks."
3,Could have been better,"This is probably my least favorite adaptation. It includes dialogue and scenes that weren't even in the book. Where do people get off re-writing one of the greatest books in history? Still, though, I must say that at least they got the characters right. Mr. Rochester was an absolute bear at first, which is what he should be. Jane Eyre actually looked the right age, although I thought she was more aggressive than in the book. The book really has too much to be done within a 90 minute format. I wish people would stop trying to squeeze months or years into hours. It just doesn't work! It does capture some of the spirit of the story, but not enough to make it interesting. Skip it."
2,Awful. Just Awful!,"This is the worst version of this movie that I've ever seen. Mr. Rochester was a disaster. Not only did he not fit the part physically, he didn't emotionally or spiritually either. The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars, was that I thought the beginning was very good, it definately portrayed the felling of the book, but the rest of the movie went downhill from there. Jane wasn't too bad, but they producer and director could have done so much more with this movie. It's such a good book, that it's a big disappointment that people think they have to improve onsomething that would be better left alone."
2,Bordering on banal,"Extremely disappointing production. Adumbrates the story. The makers apparently didn't believe the audience could take the real Jane Eyre, as they dumbed it down and tarted it up. They turned a complex, multifaceted drama into a Harlequin miniseries. What a shame: we need somebody to do for Jane Eyre what BBC/A&E did so perfectly for Pride & Predudice."
1,"So-so,depending on one's previous experience with Jane Eyre.","For those who have not viewed any other movie versions of this wonderful book, this movie would suffice--unless, of course they have read the book. In that case, one would find this movie quite lacking in comparison. For those who HAVE viewed one or another of the other movies, particularly the Timothy Dalton version, this movie would be like eating peanut butter rather than accepting prime rib!"
4,Engaging and True to the Novel,"I really like this version of Jane Eyre. Fans of romantic/historical movies will enjoy the detailed sets and costumes as well as the high drama. Fans of the novel will appreciate a script that's true to the book without ploddingly recreating it word-for-word or--just as bad--peppered with anachronisms in an attempt to make Jane Eyre hip and modern.Samantha Morton brings Jane's underlying strength of character to life and Ciaran Hinds, as Mr. Rochester, does very well with a character that can easily be overplayed to the point of silliness. They are supported by a strong cast, including Gemma Jones as Mrs. Fairfax. The overall production value is as high as the caliber of the acting.This is a good, strong production, though I do wish that the DVD came with some extras."
2,lost passion,"Having read Bronte's book Jane Eyre many times I'm aware of its strengths and weaknesses. The screen adaptation used in this particular version of the story has deleted all the charm of the novel and has over-played the dysfunction of both Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre. Hinds rants, roars, and grimaces entirely too much. Morton seems to be made of wax. In the scene where Bertha sets fire to Rochester's bed I truly expect Morton's Eyre to melt. I hope no one uses this movie as a measure of the story--it will put them off Charlotte Bronte's work forever. If you must watch a movie production of the novel try the Timothy Dalton version--though Dalton is too handsome to be true to the author's physical description of Rochester he manages to capture the man's spirit and one can understand why Jane loves him."
2,Soooooooo disappointing,"Do not waste your money on this version - get it at the library if you absoultely want to see it - it is too short and moves too fast - the actors are actually all very good, especially ""Mrs. Fairfax"" - if you love the book don't even bother watching this, unless you want to see how a classic can be ruined!! Alot of things are changed or omitted as other reviewers have said - not enough scenes of her childhood life, and not enough of her time with her new found relatives after she leaves Thornfield, etc. etc. Again, very disappointing!!"
3,"Great Movie, Bad Picture Quality","I wish someone could comment on the picture quality of the DVD. I have purchased about 20 DVD movies and rented countless more, and I thought all of them looked just fine. This is the first one I have come across whose picture resolution/sharpness resembles that of a slightly worn-out VHS tape.As for the movie, Samantha Morton was a wonderful Jane Eyre and Ciaran Hinds was a pretty good Mr. Rochester. Knowing what I know now about the DVD, I might still have bought it because I love this version of Jane Eyre and don't have it on videotape."
2,How could any Jane Eyre fan love this movie??!!,"I've read the book (10 times) and seen all the movie versions. The ""Jane"" in this video was unbelievably haughty and unattractive. How in the world did Rochester ever fall in love with her? When they kiss in the movie there is the ""chemistry"" (mentioned in other reviews), but lust isn't what the book is all about. All my favorite passages were cut out or adulterated beyond recognition. This would be a terrific disappointment to any one who really loves the book."
5,Wonderful Adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's story,I was disheartened to read some of the reviews of this wonderful adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's story. I have seen every version of this story and I believe that this is my favorite. Ciaran Hinds is a fine actor and I do believe that his performance in this production needs a little more credit than usually given. Rochester is a hard character to protray and given the script he did superbly. Samantha Morton is by far the best Jane I have ever seen. She can show more feelings in one expression of her face than I could do in a million years.I can stop seeing this movie over and over again.
1,Absolutely the worst Jane Eyre version!,"The characters have the same names as the novel but that is about as far as this version goes to stay true to the characters in Bronte's Jane Eyre. I've watched many versions of this classic novel, and this is by far the worst. Ciarán Hinds, who I usually love, plays Mr. Rochester as a raving lunatic, not a tortured man who's life has been turned upside down by an unfortunate mistake as a young man. There is no chemistry between the characters and the dialogue/plot differs so much from the novel it is a travesty to call this 'Jane Eyre.' I threw away this DVD after watching it. A waste of $$$. Buy the Timothy Dalton version for a true 'Mr. Rochester.'"
2,Ridiculous Rochester,"I love the book and the 1983 adaptation with Dalton and Clarke is my favorite. I told my husband years back (then just a bf) how much I love the book and movie and he gifted me this without knowing anything about different versions out there. I was not even aware of this adaptation myself back then and was curious to see what this Jane Eyre had to offer. I was horried to witness Ciaran Hinds screeching and screaming all the time like he was having a never-ending PMS. And let me just say I love Ciaran Hinds. He is a truly talented actor, amazing in Persuasion and Phantom of the Opera, not a one-note actor by any means. I dont understand what could possibly happen here. Did he so grossly misunderstood the character? I cannot beleive it. I am blaming the director (and maybe editors?) for misguiding him into making such a travesty out of Mr. Rochester."
3,Disappointing,"With two such fine performers as Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton, and with Charlotte Bronte's masterful story, I could not believe that this version of Jane Eyre would be anything but enjoyable. Sadly, I was disappointed. I think the problem lies with the screenplay. A complex story was reduced to 2 hours, which meant that key plot and character development had to be sacrificed. Hinds and Morton just did not have enough to work with. Stick with the Timothy Dalton version, it is far better."
5,An Excellent Adaptation!,This is an excellant adaptation of Jane Eyre and I loved watching it! Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds are perfect in their parts!
2,You have got to be kidding,"I have seen all versions and for once this one got it all wrong all over the place. These actors surely had to cringe at the treatment of the classic tale. For once I found the phrase ""never see the picture after reading the book"" correct. It would have been kinder to change the name and only allude to the author."
2,Disappointing Version Of A Classic Love Story/Suspense Thriller. Grossly Overacted By Ciaran Hinds.,"This ""Film"" version of the classic story by Charlotte Bronte is grossly overacted by Ciaran Hinds. Personally, I found him to be too harsh and cruel, barely even nice. However, Samantha Morton balanced it out quite well as the title character, though. I also didn't like the omission of the middle scenes with Mrs. Reed, which I feel are very important to the story. I prefer Timothy Dalton (4 years before he embodied the role of James Bond in ""The Living Daylights"") as Rochester. He was very well suited to the part; I read somewhere that he considers his role as Edward Rochester his personal favourite. Gemma Jones (""Sense & Sensibility"") was great as Mrs. Fairfax. If you're looking for a faithful version of ""Jane Eyre,"" I highly recommend the 1983 BBC miniseries starring Timothy Dalton, the 1944 version starring Orson Welles or the 1996 version starring William Hurt. This film version is Not Rated."
5,A different view of a classic.,I thoroughly enjoyed this version of one of my favourite novels. Both of the main actors gave credible and passionate performances to their characters.
5,Seen them all - this is the best!,I've sat through them all and Welles/Fontaine was the top Jane Eyre film in my book. But A&E is now at the top of my list with this version. This is one that you can watch over and over and be swept up in the story each time.A&E did a splendid job with the true essence of Jane Eyre - the romance and mystery that are the two high points of the novel. Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds are truly believable in the starring roles. They take Bronte to the core and give us a beautiful gift.
1,The worst version extant.,"I read Jane Eyre for the first time at the age of 15. Over the years I have eagerly watched every filmed version as they appeared. I previously thought the Orson Welles version was the worst, but I changed my mind once I saw this. The BEST film of Jane Eyre is the Susannah York/George C. Scott version, done in the early 1970's for Hallmark Hall of Fame. Wonderful in every way!! Unfortunately, not available yet on video. AVOID this version from A&E, it is truly terrible. Ciaran Hinds plays Mr. Rochester as a loud, bullying, scenery-chewing lout, and I have seldom seen a shallower, more pallid performance as Jane. Skip this movie and re-read the novel!"
1,"Good For Insomniacs, At Least...","About all this movie did was put me to sleep. I have seen every major version of ""Jane Eyre"" around, and this is just about the worst. The screenwriters have cut and pasted the the story into something that shares nothing but a title with Bronte's novel. But it's not just the butchery. The actors in this movie show little emotion-they spend the whole movie mumbling to each other in drab, monotone voices. It's like watching Jane Eyre performed by the cast of the X-Files. Sigh. If you want to see what the real ""Jane Eyre"" is like, try the BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. This movie is just weird."
2,Disappointing,"I loved the book, but this adaptation is my least favorite. Mr. Rochester is so unappealing in every way. The best version is the one with Timothy Dalton. Now that is a wonderful and romantic story and every bit as good as the book."
2,Beware....,This a multipack of different door lock clips that are supposed to be applicable to the tailgate handle of a 2007 GMC Sierra. This isn't entirely untrue but isn't really the case either. After 15 minutes of fooling around with three or four of the clips I finally managed to get one of them to work. My suggestion is to go to the dealership and pay for the GMC replacement.
5,Perfect fit for 2007 HD Tailgate,"These fit perfectly for my Chevy tailgate latch.Just remember where the extra ones were stashed, as you'll be needing one again . . . or one of your friends will."
2,Chevy tailgate clips,"I purchased this product, because my tail gate clip was broke,. They only had an assortment pack. The colors did not match, what was there and the plastic did not fit through the holes, in the tailgate rods. I suggest going to the dealer, like I did last time and save a pain, in the butt! The few dollars I saved was not worth it. Not to mention, the shipping was as much as the parts and it came, in a small envelope!"
3,Average Flea Comb,"There is nothing special about this ""John Paul"" comb; it a regular length fine-toothed (flea comb at pet stores) comb. The price is nice and I would recommend it as a filler item for someone that needs at least $25 for free shipping."
2,More of a flea comb than a comb,"My cat does okay with this brush - but it is very fine-toothed. It's hard to tell from the product photo, but this is really more of a flea comb than a true cat comb. It works well around my cat's head and ruff, but where he has thicker hair, it takes a lot of effort to keep from pulling at his fur as you try to remove the undercoat."
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"I bought this for my daughter's birthday and I am terribly disappointed. After reading the directions I tried to make the baby do what it was supposed to do. She peed all over me because you have to hold her a certain angles. I finally got her to do everything, but there is no way my daughter could. You have to squeeze her arm pretty hard to get her to cry and you have to shove the bottle in her mouth so hard so it won't leak out. After one day we returned her and we are getting the Little Mommy potty doll. Don't waste your money, I wish I would have listened to all the reviews!!!"
2,Waste of money!,"I purchased this doll for my daughter for Christmas. I was really disappointed... I couldn't get the doll to cry. I agree with another reviewer, the doll leaked water everywhere. I thought about keeping it, but now I will return it."
2,My Welcome Baby !,"oh, snap!I hav just got this toy since christmas and baby born was fun!!She can sqeak, cry, eat, do potty, taking a bath, and so much fun!Her outfit was so cute and her face is very adorable! I think it's a great toy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,my daughter loves it!,"Personally I hate the doll. It is very hard to make her pee on the potty and a pain to clean her out after her special food. But, my daughter is in love with this doll, so I had to give it a high rating. She even sleeps with it, which for my little tomboy says alot. I think I might buy a pack of diapers so when she pees, she doesn't do it all over me again. Overall, if you have a young girl, she will love it."
1,Disappointed Mom and Daughter,"THIS DOLL IS HORRIBLE, so for all the Moms that are searching for the ethnic version of the doll, don't waste your time or money. My 8 year old is a doll lover, and was very excited and surprised to receive this doll as a Christmas gift. On Christmas Day we spent several hours trying to make this doll live up to expectations, and that NEVER happened. The tedious directions on holding the doll at certain angles and trying to make her work takes ALL of the fun out of the doll. Honestly, after about 3 hours, she gave up and tossed it aside. We are going to return it ASAP. I would not recommend this doll to anyone, ethnic version or nonethnic version"
1,Big Mistake!,"I bought this doll for my daughter this Christmas(instead of Baby Annabell what she really wanted). BIG MISTAKE, she peed fine but I could not get her to cry. I kept feeding her more water and squeezing so hard and she still wouldn't cry. Her eyes do not close. My daughter wanted her eyes to close so she could put her to sleep. To Much work not worth it! I returned it for Baby Annabell."
4,Not all it was hyped up to be.,"I spent alot of money on these dolls for all the ""extras"" - my girls didn't care much about the extras. But they play with the doll like any other $5 baby doll. She's cute, she's big, but she's too expensive."
3,Just not very good,"I didn't realize this was of a piece with the ""For Dummies"" kind of books. I was expecting a thoughtful meditation on making everything in my life zen. My mistake, not the authors. But within its own terms, an okay book. Not particularly good, or particularly funny,, or particularly informative. Just simple and straightforward."
4,Edward Fowler Brings San'Ya to Life,"In this book, Edward Fowler has given a impartial yet human account of life in San'Ya Japan. He tells the story of the people he meets as people and not just down and out bums. I recommend this book highly."
1,Don't buy this book,"This is just another unauthorized biography telling stuff that you already read a million times. If you want to know what Jewel's life is really like wait until this summer when she publishes her own autobiggraphy, ""Life Stories""."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed by this book. Though the stories in it are undoubtedly true and it does describe how difficult Jewel's road to stardom was, it seemed to read more like a chronology of events than an in-depth look at her career. Quotes were interpersed throughout from Jewel and those close to her, but the author never actually interviewed her himself. You could easily find much of the factual information online for free and if you know what EDA stands for, you probably know most of it already anyway.If you are looking for more insight into Jewel's life and career, I would suggest her autobiography ""Chasing Down the Dawn"". If you want inspiration for making dreams come true and listening to your soul, ""The Architecture of All Abundance"" by Lenedra Carroll (Jewel's mom) is a must-read. If you're still thinking about this book, read the online ""look inside"" excerpt pages first - that's almost 20% of the book right there."
4,Excellent read if you are a fan,"Angel Standing By is an excellent read if you don't know how Jewel came to be standing where she is today. It follows her life from her childhood right up to a few months before her second album Spirit is released. The story is intriguing and if you are already a fan of her work, you will enjoy this book.The only downside to this book, is that while I assume those close to Jewel were interviewed about Jewel's life, Jewel herself was not interviewed. There are quotes from Jewel in here that are written from a second persons' viewpoint.Aside from that, it's a great tale and an inspiration to those who are waiting to be discovered."
2,what a FAKE!,This book is an UNAUTHORIZED biography! Jewel disagrees with the content in this book. She says some of the info is FAKE!
5,if you love jewel you'llREALLY love this book,Not like ordinary biographies. This one explains what it's like to learn how to play guitar and sing in front of people. I feel like I know her so intimately that she'd recognize me if she saw me on the street!
5,Immensely interesting!,"I enjoyed this book so much that I look forward to reading more of Porter's books.Some readers may find it necessary to keep a dictionary close by, but don't let this put you off if you are interested in the social history of England in the 18th century.The author manages to balance dry statistics with extremely interesting facts, all written in a reader-friendly manner. Chapter headings such as ""Power, Politics and the Law"" and ""Having and Enjoying"" give you an idea of the wide scope of the book.The reader will find more enjoyment in reading 18th century works (novels, biography and non-fiction) after being educated by this book.I oftentimes read, then sell my books. This is one I will not sell. I only wish I had it in hardcover.If ""What Jane Austen Knew and Charles Dickens Ate"" (sic) left you crying for some serious information about this age, I recommend this book!"
4,History Repeats Itself,"The good thing about this book is, as another reviewer has put it, that its author is a ""writer who happens to be an historian"" rather than vice-versa. ---In other words, it has an authorial voice----Unfortunately, that's also the not so good thing about it. While we are kept turning the pages with droll quips and the like, the attentive reader won't fail to notice that these quips become repetitive. Not only that, but Porter uses the same citations to make exactly the same point in different chapters. Stylism in history writing doesn't always play so fast and loose, but it does here.Several of the reviewers seem to have read this work as a classroom assignment, their first exposure to Eighteenth Century England beyond Hollywood (for at least one reviewer). For such, this book is probably just the ticket. Those looking for more depth and less anecdote will need to turn elsewhere."
1,YACK! One Star is too much!,"This has to be the worst Dutchman I have ever heard. Everyone, cast, conductor, and chorus, seems to be vastly disinterested in this work. Fricsay, Greindl, Metternich and Windgassen are all great artists who somehow fell apart in this recording. Tempi are rushed so much that no singer can properly shape phrases or allow the proper weight to accumulate. If only for the sake of the memories of these artists, don't deface it by getting this travesty!"
4,Can anybody help?.,"I'm not sure if is the same book I read once but in spanish (my native language). Anyway, I was 16 or 17 when I read it and I was like 'Wow! 'cause was about the stories of 4 teenagers, one abusing of sex, other into lesbians, then one into maniac depression and another one about changing religions constantly. Well, I would like to read it again and I'd like to know if is the same book ""Voices"" (title in english). I recomend the book for people with kind of interest about youth and its problems."
1,First Purchase On Amazon I hated !,"First off, the thing was made of plastic and rubber. Not to mention it didn't even fit on my mic stand, so I had to tape it on. Not worth the 30 bucks I spent for it."
5,SHAKIN' STEVENS IS FABULOUS,"SHAKIN' STEVENS' SONGS ARE THE BEST. I'm looking for this CD for years, but just today I can find. Here in Brazil unfortunatilly Shakin' Stevens isn't so knowed. The Sony music must show all over the Brazil Shakin' Stevens's songs."
5,Body Wishes- Rod's Best,I have always enjoyed Rod Stewart's singles but never his whole albums -Body Wishes is the exception. I remember when this record was released in the summer of 1983 ( I was only 13) and loved the singles and videos for Baby Jane and What Am I Gonna Do. I didn't buy the album on vinyl until 1986. Initially I was not impressed but really came to love it and to this day still do. Every song is a winner and was written and recorded by Rod and his band and in my opinion is his best to date despite poor record sales and reviews to the contrary. It's a shame this album has been out of print in the US since the mid 80's and has never been released on CD. I am happy to have this import copy thanks to Amazon. Definately a great buy.
2,A lesser Rod Stewart Album,"The best song on this CD is the opener, ""Dancin' Alone,"" a rocking original that Rod didn't throw together in about two minutes like he did the rest of the album. ""Baby Jane"" is good, as is ""Satisfied"" but the rest of the CD is filler featuring annoying songs with trite lyrics, sloppy playing and lazy singing. It contains 3 of the very worst Rod Stewart written songs ever, ""Move Me,"" ""Ghetto Blaster"" and the title track (""Somebody's cherries need picking"" PUhlllease Rod,.....). As for ""Sweet Surrender,"" it has a nice country groove but listen to the lyrics and the song becomes pointless. Considering Rod Stewart really is a fine songwriter, the album is a major disappointment, which explains why it snapped Rod's long U.S. streak of platinum albums."

3,Bipod,Not bad i had one made by UTG and thought it was too cheaply made. ($20) I put this on my heavy barrled bushmaster. it countured to the hand guard great and installed fast. I took it out to the desert and after about 60 rounds it was comming loose. some green locktight fixed that. At the end of the day when i tryed to colapse the legs there was sand in them preventing the boutton from being pressed in. had to blow it out but it didn't seem to be as smooth.
5,Great Book!,"This book is a great refresher for English Comp. I passed the test with a 500 using this book and the Cracking Clep book. The practice exams in the book helped a lot! The exams in the Cracking Clep book are great also, and there are also helpful tips to help you pass, especially on the essay section."
1,DIDN'T WORK FOR ME!,"I bought a new computer because the old computer stopped making the monitor work. Bought the transfer cable to get some files I didn't want to lose transfered to the new computer. Fortunately, my most important files were saved on a flash drive. The only way to make the transfer cable work is to load the files from the disc onto the old computer. Since there is no monitor, I cannot control the download. Emailed the transfer cable company to ask for help. They replied that I bought the wrong cable. Right cable costs another $35.00. Not ready as yet to spend more on files I don't really need.Ron Clasky"
3,Rescue,"A very common problem with Windows XP is that it frequently begins not recognizing new hardware plugged into the computer's USB ports. If your XP computer is having this problem, the cable is useless. Your XP system will not allow you to ""install"" the cable -- in other words, the XP system will not recognize the cable and will only give you ""install"" errors for the USB device.If your XP system is still recognizing new USB devices, then I would guess that it will work just fine. But if you have the XP/USB recognition problem, don't bother."

1,"As A Book, Terrible; A Hagiography of Mother Berchmans","Mother Berchmans was a trappestine nun who was instrumental in the success of the first Japanese monestary of her order. While I generally like Merton, this is nothing like Merton's typical style. It is in the literary format of a ""life of a holy person"" or hagiography. It emphasizes the holy and selfless behavior of the nun and the religious effect on the community. I read it as part of academic work on Merton.It tells you a lot that even Merton did not particularly like this book (but Merton disliked much of his own work).If you have a specific reason for buying this, it's a good example both of early Merton (just after his admission to the Abbey of Gethsemani) or of religious biography. If not, try one of Merton's other works. If you're new to Merton, I'd recommmendNew Seeds of Contemplation (New Directions Paperbook)."
4,Works great,"The iFire allows you to use the popular Apple Pro speakers with iBooks, iPods, and lots others.Simple to use. There's no manual or instructions needed. Just plug it in.It does the job nicely. I can use the Apple Pro speakers with my iBook. And the iFire --with its simple, white deign-- fits in nicely with the iBook and speakers."
1,Painful,"Could barely get through the first episode. A bunch of whiny teenagers all intent on being more radical than anyone else- great motivation to break something. Plus, kind of incoherent. Rather doubt that it will get any better, what with the skateboarding and all."
4,Alright,"I have never been able to get my hands on the fourth book in this series, so this one was a bit hard to follow. Especially since I read it before reading number three. I must admit, I found it rather boring. And does the author have something against the Fedorcenkos? It wasn't as sad as the third one, but it was still a tear-jerking book."
2,"Nice art, mediocre stories","The books in this series--The Ultimate Dracula, Frankenstein, Werewolf, etc.--are striking for their cover art but disappointing in their story selection. They're eclectic enough--including stories by established writers and little-known authors and varying widely in tone. But none of them really stands out. There must be better collections out there."
4,Book review,"Well written book about some battles that you do not hear much about. I recommend it to followers of the confederate ""side"" of the battle."
5,Very interesting book,"An excellent description of this key campaign of the Civil War. When I started reading the book, I could hardly put it down. This ranks as one of my favorite Civil War books. One downside -- the maps are poor, and this is no minor point. It is hard to follow the story without detailed maps."
4,Try Winston Groom instead,"For some reason I can't change my 'stars' to read 'one'. I first read and reviewed this five years. Further research into this topic, including a tenure as a book review consultant for three national civil war publications, force me to recant anything 'good' I ever said about this work. This is pure character assassination. Winston Groom's Shrouds of Glory offer a more deft, wide-range analysis of this tragic tale.I've enjoyed other works by Mr. Sword, but this effort is sinful in its intent. And again, this shoud read ONE STAR..."
3,Franklin Tennessee,"Promotion of the generals in the Civil War was not any different than promotions are today in the military, government, business, and the rest of the world. You will find that in Grant's and Lee's armies there were many generals were passed over because of some conflict with those of higher rank. The men they touted for promotion were not always the best to fill a leadership position. Some may have been very brave soldiers but not a leader. Through out the war there were some wrong men giving the orders, orders misunderstood, changed, not carried out, and the wrong order given. Maybe some battles could have been changed and had fewer casualties, but not the outcome of the war. Franklin was the most tragic battle of our Civil War and should never have happened. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
4,Fascinating and readable account of disaster in the,"Some people who have read this book with a jaundiced eye have criticized Sword for his accurate protrayal of John Bell Hood. Davis like the present president had favorites to whom he remained faithful despite their obvious shortcommings. As Sword points out Hood was a great general as a field commander but even before his physical injuries he was not suited to command an independent army. As radical Confederate Louis Wigfall commented, ""Davis has attempted to do what God couldn't; male John Hood a general."" If someone wants to understand the imprortance of the West and the disaster made by Hood, this book is required reading. It is not recommended for hero worshipers."
2,When will it end!,"I initially purchased this book out of respect for Bob Dole's accomplishments as a patriot of the United States and my own interest in World War II. However, I found the book to be a very slow read. Mr.Dole only briefly describes his actual war time experience. Most of the book is him recounting all of the trivial letters he wrote to his family while in college and in the army. It seems as if he included all of these letters in his autobiography just to fill up the pages. (Do we really need to know how he asked his mother to send him fresh laundry and cookies while in college in Kansas?!) The book does describe his recovery from his injuries, which is inspirational. But any history reader who wants to get a good idea of combat should not expect to gain any knowledge from this book."
3,One Soldier's Story : A Memoir,I purchased this book for my Father who was in WWII. I scanned the book and found it very interesting and informative. I will read it at a later date.
1,one soldiers story,I never got to read this book since a CD was sent instead of the book I ordered. It has become very difficult to buy books via the internet. The conservative book club is impossible. I tried to change the incorrect order when it came up but there was no way to do it ..so the wrong order went through. I don't plan to buy books on the internet anymore.
2,interesting but not helpful,"This book is OK if you'd like some insights on why you procrastinate, but when it comes to breaking the habit, it falls way short. The book has a slightly judgemental tone to it. It treats the procrastinator like he is immature and lacking in self-esteem. The exercises go undone because they are really nothing more than a manifestation of the old ""Just do it"" advice.Skip this book and get The Now Habit, by Neil Fiore. This one will treat you with respect, and it actually *works.*"
4,Great motivational tool,The best book on procrastination. Very well written and objective. You have to really want to change in addition to the reading the book. The book puts you in the correct mindset to evaluate everything you do to postpone the inevitable. His insight into short term avoidance is very good.
2,WOO procrastin.........,"This book left me with a ""huh; that's nice"" type of feeling. In no way, shape, or form did it help me break the habit of procrastinating. Ironically, my project (this) was sent in at the last second because I.... procrastinated. The projects in the book really just show you what type of procrastinator you are, and then they just move on, not really helping you fix the problem. The book kinda suggests that you should consider doing something but I think the author procrastinated writing some of the sections, forgot about it, then came back to writing the book and moved on..."
5,We feel this book is right on target.,My husband and I deal with many people who procrastinate. We feel that the content and tone of this book with regards to the Just Do It attitude is the appropriate path to overcoming the inability to deal with life's everyday problems. We are very interested in any information to help those we deal with and found this book to offer reliable solutions.
4,Supernaturals in the Singles Columns,"This is an excellent collection of tales of the supernatural with a theme of the personal ads. Almost all of the short stories are excellent, especially; Werotica, Secret Identities, and Folk Lure. Each is very different, while remaining within the theme. There are few authors that I will look up again."
3,Didn't work very well,"From crazzeto's wife:We have a 1999 Corolla and the shoulder belts move too much too keep the carseat base from flipping over, so we ordered this clip. It keeps the belt from moving quite as much, but not enough for me to really feel safe with the carseat in it. We have decided to sell the car and get one more family-friendly. It's worth mentioning, though, that corollas are known to have problems with moveable seatbelts causing carseat incompatability so if your car's belts aren't quite as loose as ours this clip may end up solving your problems even if it didnt' solve ours."
4,For cars older than 2002,"Can't comment about its performance since I ended up not using it, but for your information if you have a car older than 2002 models you probably need this piece. 2002 was a grace period so some cars have those latches that eliminate the need for this item."
4,Works well but can be a pain to install,"We have used this when traveling and although it works well, it can take a few minutes to install correctly. So I have to remind myself to be patient!"
5,As Advertised,"This does the trick, however, check the back of your car seat. Our Evenflow Tribute Sport had one stored on the back that I never noticed. Now I have two!"
5,I'm so glad to found this,Four years later my old car seat was in perfect shape but this clip was missing. For my new baby girl the car seat belt on the infant seat was a nightmare and realized how much I needed this. I could never find it so I purchased this one and I'm so happy I did. The infant seat is now perfectly straight and I have no worries of it tilting to the sides.
1,Hard to Install,It is important to clamp the seat belt when using a child's car seat but this clip is hard to use and a pain to get on and off. A better system is the red clamp that comes with other car seats.The Graco seat is a design nightmare and should be avoided at all costs.Always test the seat installation before buying.
1,Not Recommended,"This book was promoted as a tasteless tell-all concerning the affair of Diana and James Hewitt. Some of my high school literature stories had more tasteless detail than this book.Considering Diana broke-off the relationship (out of guilt), this book should be titled James Hewitt's Revenge.Funny Camilla was never moved to write about her affair with Prince Charles but then Charles did not end the relationship. I suppose Charles never felt any guilt for his and Camilla's actions.I would not recommend this book for anyone."
1,Don't!,"These cables reinforce the adage, ""You get what you pay for."" I bought theree, and they do not work well. One required delicate tweaking of the position of the connector to work right. One required delicate rtweaking and still had artefacts. The third, so far, woirks properly. I am replacing them with more expensive, and, hopefully, better quality, cables."
5,Fascinating!,"Having dabbled in magic most of my adult life, I had always been intrigued by the native religions of Brazil. I had only been able to track down books that gave only an overview of the various types, nothing in depth like I was looking for, until I found this. The author is a Ph.D. in Brazilian studies, and is able to write in a non-text book manner that is informative and interesting.Highly recommended for anyone who is seeking out different forms of magick."
1,This Book and Good Intentions are not Enough,"The kind of rituals described in this book are usually done with the help of an initiated practitioner. Doing them alone is likely to be offensive to these spirits, and being the tricksters that they are, they probably won't come out and say there's a problem, they'll let you think everything's OK while they take subtle revenge. It might take a long time to notice that your bad luck is because of a ritual you did out of a book like this. Not to put too fine a point on it: sincerity will not protect you. Respect is in the eye of the beholder, these spirits want to be approached through the existing channels that they established, taking a DIY approach will not work to your advantage."
1,Llewellyn strikes again,"Yuk. Obviously catering to the neo-pagan, Wiccan, and Chaos magic crowd, this book is not very good in my opinion. It appears to be written by a non-initiate for commercial gain, to appeal to the wide audience of arm-chair neo-pagans. Wicca is not Macumba. Separate traditions, that should stay that way in my opinion."
1,Its by Llewellyn - what else do I have to say!?,"This book is written by a psouo-Wiccan who tries to incorporate the Orixas and sprits of Brazil into the Wiccan mindset. Carol Dow, the author of this book, has co-written some other essays on Afro-Brazilian spirituality which are available on the internet. Ill-informed, poorly researched and completelly twisted to fit into a thelemic/chaos magical mindset, this book and other works by the author do in no way give a true perspective of Afro-Brazilian spirituality!This book MIGHT only be ""a gem"" if you come from a Wiccan or Chaos Magical background and want to follow the latest trend, but it is useless for everyone who is interested in exploring these traditions ""from the source"". Even the translation of a well known book on Pomba Gira can almost be sidcarded after this author had her hands on the work. Its a shame!"
5,MIND & LID BLOWING,"Paul Grushkin and Dennis King blow the lid off today's youth culture and expose the world to the underground music genre in this colorful high quality heavy duty super deluxe 500 page tome. If you're under 75 you won't be able to get along without it so you might as well order now. For those who can't read the highly researched and informative text, who cares? The art tells the whole story and can be seen as a documentary on the visual expression of the decline of western civilization and maybe the world in general. Feed your head and charge your batteries as the whole mess spins out of control and slides down the tubes."
5,Lover of Pop Art,"I first encountered this book at a friends apartment in Berlin, Germany while on my honeymoon and was blown away by how good the art was. For lovers of this type of art, it is a must have and I'd highly recommend it."
5,Fantastic,"This book is THE bible for poster art. Fantastic collection of art, with great interviews and history accompanying. Obviously a lot of hard work by a lot of people passionate about poster art. Highly recommended."
5,The Authority on Gigposters!,I got this book on Monday. It looks so great! Definitely worth the wait! No question- this is the authority on modern Gigposters! Hundreds of pages of awesome artwork by all of the top designers. You have to pick this up!
5,"Great piece of art (of modern rock, lol)",This is a MUST for both art and rock music lovers. It's simply a pleasure to browse through its pages again and again!
1,Piece of Crap,Wouldn't blow bubbles at all don't waste your time. I did read the other review i decided to give it a try because some bubbles wouldve been better then what i got which was none
1,LESS THAN HAPPY,THE PRUNERS WERE ADVERTISED FOR SMALL HANDS BUT THEY ARE STILL TOO LARGE FOR MY HANDS COMPARED TO OTHER PRUNERS THAT I HAVE USED!!
2,Not For Beginners,"This book is very comprehensive in its coverage of c++. The author states that their goal for this text is to 'provide a C++ reference book, a tutorial for C++ beginners, and an advanced book--all in one. My experience trying to learn C++ from this book has been one of utter frustration. The authors have a habit of using concepts covered hundreds of pages later in the beginning programs. The explanations are complete and thorough if you already have a handle on all the concepts but I would never give this book to a beginner."
4,Great as both a reference and as a learning tool.,"As a C programmer, I needed a book that taught me C++ quickly, but that I could use later as a reference guide. This book does both very well. The text is readable and the examples helped me a lot in understanding the concepts. I highly recommend this book."
1,Not for a book Beginners,"This is not a book for learning C++. If you are just learning C++, you can expect this book to be of absolutely no help."
1,Absolutely incomprehensible! Save your money!,"Find another book on C++Would you go buy the book ""War and Peace"" in Russian if you wanted to learn Russian? Of course not! That would be ridiculous. This book pre-supposes you are an expert programmer, and that is also ridiculous.It is not well-organized. It lacks good appendices, index, etc. It is not well-written.And it might as well have been in Russian - it's that incomprehensible."
1,This is the worst C++ book I've ever seen,"This is a very bad organized book. It is full of those never used details from such un-noticed cornors. It is not a text book for beginers, nor a reference book for a programmers. It puts same emphasis on those everyday concepts and those tips may never used in you whole programming career. Nor this book has good examples, most examples are very short and not suitable. Comments: DONOT BUY THIS BOOK."
1,I second the rating of 1 for this book,Attempted to use the book as secondary book for an OOP course this semster. The complexity of exmplaes and the backward and forward references definitely turned off the students. Almost impossible to use book as effective tutorial or reference.
1,super blue stuff,I was trying to get the original super blue stuff shown in the picture - which really was a godsend for me for pain. But the new product by blue spring isn't the same without the menthol. I ordered this product hopeing to get the one in the picture with the blue spot but what arrived was the new version by bluespring. I wish I could still get the original version
3,Only 1 episode is watchable!,"This 2 episode DVD is really only 1 episode, since you can not watch the first episode. 'The Late Christmas Gift' which is from 1954 is so grainy that it is difficult to watch without getting eye strain or a headache! I was very disapointed to have spent the money on what I thought was 2 shows, and I could only watch the second episode from 1956. The one thing that makes this worth buying is a commerical by Ozzie & Harriet for the New York World's Fair (1965). Since I went as child, it brought back some found memories. Again let me stress the second episode is fine and very enjoyable. Even Ricky sings a Christmas song at the end, so it was not a total waste of money."
2,Very disappointing video quality,First let me say that I love Ozzie and Harriet but this DVD is a major disappointment. One of the shows is so grainy and blurry that it could pretty much only be listened to as it was hard on the eyes to view. I hope in the future so see these shows digitally remastered and will check for that before purchasing any more DVDs of theirs. I gave it two stars for the stories but it did not deserve more due to the quality of the DVD picture.
3,Could be better,Saw these episodes when I was 12 % 14. Stories good...Of course theme music great...many memories... video quality questionable.
3,It's ok,"I thought it would be funnier than it was. I would not prevent someone from watching it, but I don't need to watch it again."
3,Johnny Lost a bet?,"I am a huge Depp fan, but this movie really let me down. It was almost like Johnny lost a bet and had to make the film."
3,It was OK,"I did not watch the original Dark Shadows on TV, did not know the premise. From the promos, I thought it might be really funny - did laugh some and Johnny was his usual great self. Good story, didn't enjoy it as much as I expected to."
3,Cast Great ... movie missing,It was ok but it could have used a lot more play off the other characters... The cast rocked but they seemed to be pigeon holed in their characters.
4,Not too shabby,"This was a pretty good movie. It was more energetic than the original series, while still maintaining the aspects that made it great."
3,Big Johnny Depp Fan,This show was not one of his better ones. Liked the idea but the show just dragged.Never really got going
3,It was so so.,"It was just so so. I like Johnny Depp, but this didn't impress me. No I would not recommend it."
3,Great movie. Poor streaming,"Movie was great, but the streaming quality was worse than a cheap bootleg. Never had any stops, but the pixilation was horrible. AND I paid for HD. there is a problem when Amazon says they will reduce the quality to stream better, but you still paid for HD."
3,it's okay,This movie was just okay I could do with never seeing it again. Thought there would be more to it.
3,not bad as a tribute,"It's OK. As a tribute to the original, it wsa enjoyable, but it isn't much on its own. had some very good acting, and some terrible acting. A few interesting twists. Would have been better if it were a ""new generation"" insted of a ""remake."""
3,It's got some good parts,"I like Tim burton a lot but I feel like he may have over did his ""weird"" movie thing. I won't ruin the movie for you if you plan on watching it but the ending killed it when a teenage girl turns out to be something. It's corny. Not strange like I like it."
2,i was so dissapointed with this one!,"You mean to tell me, there's a Tim Burton movie, staring Johnny Depp (as per usual) that sucks???? YES. That is exactly what i'm telling you. i wish i had watched this one before buying. i'm currently using it as a frisbee."
2,I couldnt finish this movie. I want my time back,"I have been a Depp fan every since Who's Been Eating Gilbert Grape.This movie is just boring. There is nothing really funny, or interesting.Its more like seeing Johhny Depp walk around in a funny outfitwalking around scene to scene aimlessly.Badly written, waste of everyone's time, Depp's time, the producer'stime and most of all --- AUDIENCES.Again, I am such a fan of Depp and its sad that this happened butyou cant win them all as they say."
5,ALWAYS GOTTA LIKE JOHNNY.,EVERYONE HERE LIKES THIS MOVIE MORE THAN WE THOUGHT WE WOULD BUT WE TRY TO GET JOHNNY'S STUFFAS HE GIVES HIS ALL.
2,Tim Burton's mitake,"I watched this film at a theater.I didn'te liked it.I thought that it's because of my condition that day.I bought it in a bluray because it was 9.99$ at that time.I felt regret.I still hate it.Story is boring and actors are lame.Worst Tim's movie ever.Maybe he was tired making movie at that time or he was drunk.The sound and picture quality is very good. The sound was divided into 5 channel HD nicely.The video is clear and sharp.If you watched this movie at the theater and still wanna have it, you should buy the bluray.I don't know why they put the price higher from 9.99$ to 19.96$ though."
2,A Poor Follow-up to a TV Original,"Dark Shadows had an encouraging beginning. It was tongue-in-cheek, the outdoor scenes depicting Collinsport were as I had imagined so many years earlier. Even the actors were well cast and played their roles well. But about two thirds through, the whole film fell apart. The plot became totally senseless. Actors were no longer in character. There were endless scenes of special effects for no good reason. Any remaining humor was superfluous slapstick, and even the ending was open to interpretation, if there was anything left to interpret at that point. Avoid this one like the plague."
1,Just awful,"We expected so much more from a Johnny Depp movie. We expected campy, and that weird comedic sense that always comes along with a Depp / Burton sollaboration, but this was just awful."
1,Wasted $,"I guess if you're in love with Johnny Depp, or Tim Burton, then watching this movie all the way through will satisfy your jones for them. I fell asleep after 20 minutes; the rest of the family watched the whole movie but told me later they wished they had just turned it off."
4,Pretty funny,I enjoyed the movie. It was the first Blu Ray movie I bought. The quality was as good as a theater.
1,Awful,"Take the word really, multiply it by 100, then add the word bad, and you have the mathematical formula for rating this movie."
4,Dark Shadows,"Awesome movie. Depp put a more comical twist in this version. I also loved the short appearance of Fridd, the original Barnibus Collins. I love the original version still, but great movie."
2,Distasteful,"They missed the mark on this one. The actors, the script and the sets were first rate but there was one aspect of the story that really sucked. Very good, nice, decent people got killed by the vampire. The vamp was the guy we were supposed to sympathize with. He had a charming personality and somewhat of a morale compass. Hollywood should have used their standard trick of having the vampire only kill bad people."
2,Not very impressed,"I got this to watch with my wife and kid based on previews I had seen, thinking it would be more of a family comedy in the silly, of the wall Burton styled. I was wrong ; turned out more like the Addams family, but more adult humor (""death becomes her"" comes to mind). My incorrect assumption aside, I still didn't think it was very good. Not Burton or Deposit best."
1,Disappointing!!,"Wish I'd read the reviews! This is nothing like the trailer. I thought it was supposed to be a comedy, but turned out to just be weird. Don't waste your money on this one!"
1,Waste of Time,"I wouldn't bother watching this movie it's a waste of time, nothing funny and full of perversion. I love Johnny Depp but this was a total let down."
2,Depp's darkest shadow,Compared to other Depp stuff I have seen this is on the low end. I watched about half of it before I turned off the TV.
2,Dark Shadows was a snoozer,The movie was very slow moving and was not that funny. Too bad since it was a great cast. Maybe worth a $1.00 Redbox rental but that's it.
4,Hillarious,"Great comedic movie. Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Michelle Pffeifer are amazing as usual. You and your family will love this movie."
2,"Not that bad, Not that good","The biggest problem I see with this movie, is the billing. I remember wanting to see this at the theater because I thought it was funny. It was billed as funny by all the commercials for this movie. But when you see it, it is really not a comedy. So I think a lot of people were under the wrong impression by how this was billed."
3,had high hopes...,"...but ultimately this movie just couldn't live up to my expectations. I love Johnny Depp and he is utterly delicious in this as he is in everything; howevery, not even Johnny could save this movie. Too many plot holes and unanswered questions. Silly dialogue and a few unfortunate casting choices. I loved the tv show (in the early 90's?) and I thought the tension between Barnabas and Victoria is what really made the show work. Here, it took the back seat to too many other, less interesting story lines."
3,Not at all what I expected!!,"From direction and production to the story-line, itself, I believed sub par. The characters, themselves, even lacked certain character... However, having said that, you must understand I am a HUGE critic.. And, when I am to ascertain the idea of a movie, with the likes of Johnny Depp - who I believe to be one of the best, if not THE BEST, of any and all other actors(to say the least) - I expect that movie to be one, of two, things: A Blockbuster, or, mine-blowing!! So, it is QUITE POSSIBLE that I an being to harsh.... But, always keep in mind, no matter what else, a movie is always a ""Must See"" if it is starring JOHNNY DEPP!!!!"
2,Meh!,"Not like the original Dark Shadows. This was downright bad. I'm a big fan of both Depp/Burton, but it just came off as being silly, awkward, boring and downright bad."
3,Darks Shadows (BD),"Lame production. Not up to Johnny Depp and Tim Burton standards. However, there are a few bright spots within the movie. Love daughter's reaction to mother when she first appears as werewolf."
2,Not one of Tim Burton's Best,"I really wasn't happy with this movie, it was slow and hard for me to get interested in it. The scenery and use of colors was awesome though."
2,Weak Entry from Tim Burton,"Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and ""Dark Shadows"" would seem to be a match made in heaven, high-camp or otherwise. Unfortunately, it's not. The story, which combines a Gothic love triangle, lazy jokes about 1970s pop culture, and 200-year-old vampire Barnabas Collins's struggle to break a curse set on his house by the witch whose love he rejected in the 18th century and restore his family's fortunes, never comes together in any meaningful way. The movie is overpopulated, and we are given little reason to care about any of the characters.I didn't hate ""Dark Shadows,"" but I couldn't shake the feeling that this was a movie in search of a reason to have been made. It wasn't played straight enough to be taken on its own terms, and it wasn't played over-the-top enough to be campy fun. Burton's always-enjoyable visual style is wasted on this overlong, dull film."
2,OK,It was a little too campy for me. I love supernatural and vampire flicks but this one just didn't do it for me.
4,Loving Barnabas!!,I have fond memories of watching this all the time when I was a kid!This movie was good but I guess I was expecting more.
4,"A little unusual, but good.","This is a quirky movie, but it's a good ""dark"" comedy. There is a disproportionate number of funny scenes in the trailers, so the movie may be a little more serious than one may be led to believe from the ads. Overall, good enough I will buy the Blu-Ray."
2,"Some very good scenes, but a bad movie","Could have been a good comedy or a good horror movie or a good spoof, but trying for all three in one movie just did not work."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"We thought this film would be more ""campy,"" like most Tim Burton films. It seemed to be trying to be serious and, unfortunately, just didn't work very well."
2,"Great cast, poor script","I'm a Tim Burton fan even after watching this movie. The visuals and cast could not overcome the dull, uninspired script."
2,What Were They Thinking?,"Big fan of Tim Burton, Johnny Deep and even bigger fan of Dark Shadows. I had bad feelings about this movie when I saw the trailers, but thought I'd stay open minded. Didn't go to the theater to see it after all of the bad reviews, but decided to rent it on Blu-ray when released. Was not worth the wait. Very disconnected from the original series, not the same mood or tone, characters totally different from the series. Didn't mind it being up dated or re-imagined, but this mess of a film that did everything wrong. Did the creator's ever see the original series? The music from the series is iconic, but there was not a single refrain in the score. Over the past 50 years Bond films, while being updated, retain something of the original. This film was more of a parody, more Saturday Night Live skit, than a new vision of Dark Shadows. Complete waste of time!"
3,Dark Shadows,"I just rated this ""OK"" because I expected it to be funny. I actually had a hard time staying awake through the entire movie."
2,Interesting idea bad exicution.,"Started off very interesting and had some funny moments, but was still missing something. The main issue is trying to have a comedy and horror movie at the same time cant really be done. It's just to weird and doesn't help advance the plot or the characters."
5,great movie,Classic Movie by Tim. He is one of my fav Producers/Directors. Couldnt ask for anything more. did a great job.
4,Dark Shadows,"It was a campy and fun film. Of course, I love Johnny Depp and Michele Pfeiffer was great. Fun night's entertainment."
2,Meh,Should have waited for it to be a dollar rental. To much of a fan of the original series to enjoy this take off.
2,dark shadows sucks more than just blood,I found myself chuckling just once throughout the whole movie.The plot was weak and the dialogue mediocre to put it gently.Would not recommend this movie even to my worst enemy
2,Just not very funny,"I had high hopes for this movie, but it just wasn't very good. It was slow from the start, never really reaching any kind of pace that was interesting. There were a few good moments, but nothing close to being something I could recommend to people. All in all, I would say it was just dull and boring."
1,I was surprised I hated it but I did!,I usually LOVE Johnny Depp and I also liked HIM in this movie but I hated this movie! I couldn't even finish it. I totally lost my interest. A few of the lines were funny but they were far and few between! I am glad I didn't waste my money at theater like I was going to when this movie first came out.
1,Wretched.,"Even Johnny Dep couldn't save this pile of excrement. Once again, Tim Burton managed to take an excellent group of actors and reduce them to mindless, two dimensional, humorless caricatures. The trailer is the best part of this"
2,disappointed,"This film started out ok but lost it's mojo about half way through.It sdeemed Tim Burton was tired of this film about half way through and gave up on makinga good film. You really should have tried harder, Mr. Burton. The orginal Dark Shadowsmovies were something to be proud of. They still give me the chills."
1,Dark Shadows,"I really didn't like this movie, the tv series was much better. My point of view Johnny Depp hasn't made a great movie in years. The only good thing about this movie was when Alice Cooper was singing. Other then that the movie was stupid and boring."
2,The Vampire that killed comedy.,"The acting, effects and actors were all great. But I'm sorry I sat through the whole thing waiting to get into it. But the life was all sucked out."
1,Tim Burton: Please keep your claws off the following films.,"ANY MOVIE FROM A-Z! Stick to creating your own stuff and stop leeching and perverting other peoples visions and creations. Did you not see House of Dark Shadows? A step down from the series but it was Barnabas as originally envisioned by Curtis. A dissolute vampire who comes back for his love and has no remorse in murdering his whole family. Barnabas thru pure butchery destroyed his own descendants in his attempts to find his Josette. Running time about 95Minutes a little longer then your film and even with 10 minutes that never made it to the film and that Curtis destroyed. That could have a starting point and then you could have added your Burtonesque quirks. You couldnt even do that. You and Depp had to have your Keystone cop approach. Stupid, humorless. Stay the F away from others films."
3,Wish I had waited for availability on Redbox,While not a complete waste of time this is definitely not Dark Shadows as I knew it. In general I like most thing from Tim Burton however this was not up to the usual standards I expect. I guess everybody has a clinker once in awhile. I've rated it at 3 stars as there are some funny parts and the film is not flat out terrible. I wish I had waited for it to have been available on Redbox as it is not worth $3.99 to me but would be reasonable for a buck and change.
3,Disappointed,"Did not live up to classic series. Could have had a longer glimpse of the original stars, if you blinked, you could have missed them. Should have been less comedy and more drama."
3,"Nice to look at,,,BUT","What happened to the story? I expected an update of the TV serial which was chock full of plot. Instead I saw a flic that was neither scary or funny but a watered down screenplay that bordered on the corny. I am a fan of the TV drama, Burton and Depp... and much of the cast. Was I disappointed? You bet! I did like the songs featured in the movie and I wondered why the closing song by the Killers, Go All the Way, was not included in the CD soundtrack??"
2,How sad,"Such a great cast and amazing potential, but several brilliant people missed the mark. I don't think they could all settle on what the film wanted to be so it was ""kinda"" several things, never being successful in one direction."
4,Good if you like the actors.,"If you like the actors its an ok movie.You can see some of the quality direction and acting you would expect in a Burton film but at the same time you feel like its a bit disjointed.Disjointed I can overlook if I like who I am watching but it is noteworthy in a film with high potential.So I like it and it was ""ok"". But not a block buster."
4,Dark Shadows great ride,"Loved this movie, we thought Johnny Depp once again did a great job with wonderful supporting cast. This movie had a couple surprise twists that surprised us. Great fun."
3,Meh,"I was a bit disappointed with this movie. I expected it to be over the top and funny. While there is a little bit of that, I found that it was too serious to be a funny movie and too funny to be taken seriously. If that makes any sense."
3,could have been funnier,"I think this could have been funnier. if it had more action, like it did toward the end of the movie."
3,just ok,I wanted to see this movie from the first time I heard about it ..It wasn't nearly as good as I had hoped for ...
3,Good in pieces not as feature film,Trailer is well done; Johnny Depp is super but pacing is very choppy and storyline runs like a Woody Woodpecker trail to Mexico.
1,Surprisingly Bad,"One would think Dark Shadows with Johnny Depp directed by Tim Burton would be thoroughly entertaining, but it just doesn't turn out that way. The movie starts out as a campy, nostalgic and fun comedy, but it runs out of humor after about the first 15 or 20 minutes. After the charming introduction is over, the movie proceeds to laboriously suck the life out of anyone watching it and everyone in it. The weak script relies on way too much gratuitous action that seems meaningless and boring. If you are planning on watching this movie, prepare to be disappointed."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Terrible disappointment! Loved the original series, this was a bore.One exception - Johhny Depp's acting was top notch as usual."
2,not what i expected,This was definately not my favorite movie. It did not flow at all. Most of the movie did not make sence and the surprises lost it impact by the bad acting and terrible story line.
4,Enjoyable,"This was a great modern day reimagining of a classic show, and I very much enjoyed it. I am a long time Tim Burton fan, and although it is not one of my absolute favorites of his, I still found it to be quite enjoyable. Johnny Depp was cool as Barnabus Collins, and the rest of the cast also played their roles very well. If you're a fan of vampire movies in whatever fashion or a Tim Burton fan or just want something imaginitive and/or entertaining to watch, I highly recommend checking out this movie. I for one will be adding this to my Tim Burton collection."
1,I wish I could have seen it!,I was traveling and had downloaded but was having many problems with wifi-roamingand never was able to complete the movie!
2,Dark Shadows DVD,"I was looking forward to this DVD, but it was very disappointing. It had a few funny parts, but it wasn't very entertaining."
5,Depp is glorious,"If you're expecting a continuation of the old TV series, save your money, but if you're looking for the unique stylized Burton/Depp comedy, this is it.I am a difficult comedy audience and seldom laugh out loud. This one provoked deep, satisfying chuckles. The sex scene with Barnabas and Angelique gave new meaning to monkey love.The whole movie was beautiful. The story was actually incidental to the movie, but who cares. It was a feast for the eyes."
3,OK but not great,If you are a johnny Depp fan you might enjoy this one. It has some funny parts but overall I expected more.
3,"Really entertaining performance, but the story plods.","Johnny Depp never lacks for character; there are several other solid performances, and much visual and storytelling cleverness. There's just not quite enough meat in the story to be worthy of those other aspects in my opinion."
5,Present,This is a present for my wife for christmas and she wanted it so it got her fast and she will love it
2,Boring,I so wanted to like this movie. But it was so slow and boring. The costumes were great but all the funny parts were given away in the previews. Save this one for a day when you've watched everything else and don't waste a dime on it. And this is coming from a girl who will watch practically any bad movie.
2,didn't love it,"I stayed awake for the whole movie, but if I didn't pay for it I probably would have fell asleep. It was mildly entertaining at parts but all in all I would not recommend watching it for 3.99. Just my opinion though."
2,very disappointed,It could have been a really good movie but it was rather boring and didnt fit the time period they were going for it also could have left some stuff out
1,Couldn't get through it.,"Watched about half of this and wanted my money back. Not engaging on any level. I was surprised, as I usually enjoy Burton and Depp. Very rare that I won't at least give a film a full viewing, but I just couldn't see this turning around."
1,The only movie I've ever walked out of,"This is the only movie I've ever walked out of. It was absurd, but not in a campy-fun kind of way. In a why-did-I-pay-$10-to-see-this kind of way."
4,DVD is literally dark,"I watched this movie at the theatre and really enjoyed it. I bought it to share with my family. However, the DVD was really dark as in half the picture was so dark you could not see any details. True we did not watch the movie at night with no lights. Maybe that would have helped. But we did have all the drapes pulled so it was semi-dark in the room. And during much of the movie it was so dark that we could not see any detail at all. So....started at 5 stars for content and subtracted one star for quality of DVD. I would recommend viewing this at night with no lights."
1,You never sent this item to me.,This is another DVD that you never sent me. Feel like you stole money that I paid for items with. I can't be a customer of yours when you don't send me items that I paid for.
2,Not impressed,I could not into this movie even my mom got up and left the room. I tried again before my 24 hr limit was up but it still did not capture me although I love Johnny Depp. I just could not watch this movie. Maybe I will give it another try sometime.
5,stars,"It was very good,alittle slow at times but all and all a pretty neet movie.I think the wife enjoyed it more than I,but ya it was cool."
2,Jmd,Did Absolutely nothing for me. I didn't even find a whole lot of humor. I don't recommend this for purchase.
3,ok,"I love the versitility of Johnny Depp, he can play many different role personalities and still will not be out of character. Some parts were funny, overall it was ok."
3,It's Okay,"Plenty of witty comments and good lord is there ever some sweet sweet Eva Green cleavage. Thankfully that's all I was expecting, and that's all I got."
3,Ok not great,"There were some funny moments, but overall I would have to rate this movie as no better than average. There are better Johnny Depp movies."
3,Johnny Depp tries to save it,"It was okay, I won't waste my time watching it again. Unfortunately, they showed all the good parts in the preview."
3,Not what I expected from Tim Burton.,Had possibilities but missed the mark. Should have played up the camp. Some parts were very funny but others just stupid.
3,Dark Shadow,This movie is okay. I found it to be funny but I would not buy this. I found using Prime was worth buying from Amazon. I love being able to rent a movie without leaving home. I do wish the time I had to view was longer.
3,"not really all that funny, but enjoyable",Its listed as a comexy and I guess you could call it that. Its a bit of a stret h though. I would call it. Dar Shadows 2010 I really think the acting was great by Depp.
1,Tim Burton lost his magic,"Why does Tim Burton insist on ruining his career with crap like this? (or that less than wonderful Alice in Wonderland?). He used to be amazeballs! Dark Shadows was just dreadful and worse, boring."
4,Depp shines,"I enjoyed the movie - kind of a gothic, melodramatic comedy. The cinematography was fantastic and Depp shined, so much so that most of the cast faded into the background. As an original Dark Shadows fan, I was a bit disappointed in this. In the movies defense, I knew very little about it before I saw it, so rated it without that factor. I only saw it once on a small screen."
2,Disappointed,"I'm a fan of Johnny Depp but I was disappointed with this movie. The story is not very solid or interesting. It just doesn't make any sense. I wouldn't recommend this movie, it was a waste of time."
5,Johnny Depp doing what he does best!,"I have watched this twice so far and loved it even more the second time!Johnny Depp is a master at playing this type of roll - a little droll humor, a lot of fantastic facial expressions and hand mannerisms, as well done as my favorite, Edward Scissorhands. I'm glad to see Michelle Pfeiffer back in some good rolls too. She's still as beautiful as ever as she ages!The team of Depp and Tim Burton is hard to beat. Special effects are great in this one."
3,Interesting.,"I wouldn't call this a must-see. It was interesting enough to keep me entertained but it was not great. Barely a 3-star, but that's just my opinion."
2,DVD +ULTRAVIOLET COPY,THE MOVIE AND DVD ITSELF WAS GREAT BUT THE TITLE WAS IN ERROR. THERE IS NO ULTRAVIOLET COPY.. ULTRAVIOLET CAN ONLY BE THRU BLUR-RAY. THIS WAS NOT A BLUE RAY COPY...SO I BOUGHT IT THINKING I WOULD BE GETTING ULTRA VIOLET CAPABILITY.. DISAPPOINTED AND MISLED.
2,Dumb,I am a big fan of Johnny Depp but this movie is terrible. they even left room for there to be a sequel for some stupid reason!
2,Not worth the money,I though the preview was hilarious and was really looking forward to watching this movie. I was disappointed by it though.
5,Excellent movie that will definitely keep you inthused throughout the entire movie.!!,"JONNY DEPP WAS FANTASTIC IN THIS MOVIE, KEPT ME ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT AND GLUED TO THE TV. WONDERFUL PLOT AND ENDING. THOUGHT IT WAS A BIT OF A HORROR/COMEDY TYPE OF MOVIE. AN ALL AROUND GREAT MOVIE TO SEE. !!!! GAVE IT FIVE STARS FOR STORY, PLUS J. DEPP'S VERSITILE ACTING PERFORMANCE.!!"
4,Dark Shadows,"As usual Johnny Depp was funny but this film kind of dissappointed me. Was slow in places, funny in some, but didn't go the way I thought it would. The end was wrong of course, but hey it's a movie.. but liked it to a point and didn't like it"
4,Love Johnny Depp,"True to the awesome movies Johnny Depp stars in, this one does not disappoint at all!! Funny and entertaining. Would recommend seeing it."
2,Not what I expected,"So much so, I fell asleep during the movie and plain forgot I rented it in time to try and watch it again.. figured might as well not try a second time."
2,Boring Beyond Belief,"The trailer for this movie looked really funny, but that was very misleading...the only funny parts were in the trailer and the rest of the movie was a snoozefest. It left a lot to be desired, the character development, plot, and ending all needed a bit of help and energy...basically, don't waste your money on this one, you will regret it!"
4,Decent movie,"good job by actors. Nice light hearted movie, not one if you're looking for something serious. Typical Tim Burton stylish/atmospheric type movie."
1,"""Depp Shadows"" Wears Clown Shoes","As a die-hard fan of the original '60s version of ""Dark Shadows"" and the 1991 NBC version of the series, I waited anxiously ever since this movie was first announced in 2007. What Burton and Depp created five years later was comedic trash. They could've produced a gothic-horror classic, instead they went for the juvenile comedy route instead. EPIC FAIL."
2,huge letdown,"as a huge johnny depp fan i was really looking forward to this movie. but unfortunately its awful. the acting is horrible, the plot is confusing, and depps talents are wasted. i wont spoil the ending for people but be warned, ITS CREEPY."
5,IT'S A DIFFERENT APPROACH,"I'm a Dark Shadows fan from the soap opera days of yesteryear. I also loved the remake starring Ben Cross, which was closer to the original but still a different approach in it's own right. If you can just forget the story we all know and accept this movie on it's own terms, it's quite entertaining. I think we all have had our fill of remakes with no creativity."
2,Burton is hit or miss but what a waste of a cast,"Burton has done stuff I've loved, he's done stuff I've hated, this just disappoints.Some of the funny bits would have been better with better timing or if something else had come next, but he would deliver a nice bit and let it lay there. They could have boiled this whole movie down to three minutes of very clever stuff, wait they did! The trailer.Glad I didn't spend the dough to see this at the theater."
5,Another great production by Tim Burton staring Johnny Depp,"Tim Burton did it again, another classic with an excellent cast.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, good story line, superbly cast and constantly moving."
3,Dark Shadows,"Light, funny, somewhat amusing but did not follow the original series. Hopefully the sequel will hold true to the original more closely."
3,Good but could have been much better,"Good but I expected more from Johnny Depp and Tim Burton.Guess my expectations were a bit too high.....Johnny Depp's performance was outstanding , but the story itself needed a bit more flesh."
3,very entertaining,Did not watch the series. Saying that did not regret purchasing this movie. Enjoyed watching it with the family. Hope you enjoy it also.
3,entertaining------,"I watched this because it has Johnny Depp. Plain and simple. I did enjoy it, but I probably won't be watching it over by myself, it will have to be because I'm showing it to someone else. Why? Well, frankly, it could have been written better. Overall, the story was ok, but I would have liked to have more of the history of the story actually played out, and not just quickly reviewed with shots and clips here and there. Just me, I guess."
3,Decent at best,It just wasn't nearly as funny as I thought it would be. Good plot but I guess I came in expecting to laugh a lot more. My fiancé is an easy laugh so when she wasn't either I knew it wasn't just me.
4,Good Movie,"Actually quite suprized at this movie, i thought it was goin go be all fluff and stupid, but turned out to be a great storyline and movie. Guess never judge a book by it's cover..."
5,Dark Shadows,"I really enjoy this movie. Johnny Depp always seems to become his characters. Casting was well done. I watch all of Tim Burton's movies. Dark and satirical comedy is his forte, and I am one of the fans for this type of work. He and Johnny Depp, along with Helena B. Carter, make a terrific team. Michelle Pfiffer was a great addition. This movie stands alone even without knowing the original series."
2,Lame,Some funny moments but pretty lame. The sets are cool but the story just doesn't stand up and it is boring.
1,All the good scenes were in the trailer,That's two hours of my life I will never get back! Do not make the same mistake I did and avoid this movie.
4,Funny,"This was a little different from your typical vampire movie, but funny. Not real sure what the daughter ended up being at the end."
5,Dark Shadows dvd,"I love this dvd and have watched it several times since receiving it. Johnny Depp's wry sense of humor, facial expressions and accent are perfect for the role of Barnabas Collins. Michelle Pfeiffer turns in a great performance as the matriarch of the Collins clan. Helena Bonham Carter is a trip as the alcoholic psychiatrist! The rest of the cast are equally adept at playing their roles as well. The soundtrack is great, including my favorite, Night's In White Satin by the Moody Blues and the appearance by Alice Cooper is wild! The visual effects are stunning and eerie and add to the enjoyment of the film. Love this film more each time I watch it and am happy to have it in my collection."
3,Not as funny as we expected.,dark humor with slightly less humor than was hoping for but not a waste of time or money...just average flick
3,Not Bad But Expect More From Depp,Of course I have never seen the original show so i can really only base the story line off the movie. The story line was ok but at points you felt like it was going no where and pretty much everything that happened you expected it to happen. Johny Depp you would expect to have a great preference in the movie but he just gives a so so preference in the movie. There are random scenes in the movie it seems like they just threw in to add to the length of the movie and has nothing to do with the plot line. Having said that they overall movie was ok.
4,another johnny depp and tim burton movie,"un-original but still entertaining. reminds me of alice in wonderland. i had a coupon so it was free, no complaints about stream quality"
5,Typical Johnny Depp Classic,"This movie once again shows what a great comedic actor JD is. It rivals the Pirates of the Caribbean series and Alice in Wonderland. It took me a while before I became a fan of his, but I sure am now. Johnny, keep 'em coming!!!"
5,A Dark Side,"Dark Shadows has been around for a long time and has run many times on TV. A series to contend with in the life of a vampire. Depp, Pfeiffer, and Carter turn on the charm and magic to make this film a great keeper."
5,Dark Shadows,"The movie is fun to watch. It wasn't like the old dark shadows, this is set in modern times. Jonny Depp is great."
3,"If you enjoyed ""Sleepy Hollow""","If you are familiar with some of Burton and Depp's previous movies together, you may find this film to be closely allied with their film ""Sleepy Hollow"". While ""Dark Shadows"" has some underlying humor not present in ""Sleepy Hollow"", it does have that same gothic-macabre feel. If you are looking for the eerie charm of ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Dark Shadows"" is much more intense."
4,Lot's of fun that feels like classic Tim Burton!,"What I love most about this film is that it reminds me of the classic Tim Burton films like Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, Edward Scissor Hands and the film he produced Nightmare Before Christmas. If you miss classic Burton than this film is for you! I saw this not knowing anything about the source material (Dark Shadows soap opera) and didn't know it was based on the old an TV show until after seeing it. I'd say it's like Austin Powers meets the Adams Family with sexy/gothic art direction and wardrobe. Just when you thought Johnny Depp was out of tricks he manages to deliver a fresh performance and give Banabus Collins (main character) a life of his own. This movie was a great summer flick that didn't get the attention it deserved. Recommended!!"
1,Awful,"When I found out that a movie Dark Shadows was coming out , I was thrilled. The horror was attending this awful garbage movie. One of the few I've ever walked out on. Absolutely one of the worst movies , EVER! Don't waste your time or money."
1,What a let down.,Total disappointment from the campy fun series on television. Could have been great but the writers really let us down.
1,Awful,"Tired, unfunny and unimaginative. I couldn't make it further than 40 minutes in and then I had to turn it off. Probably great for FANS of Tim Burton. Not good for everyone else."
1,Wow! REALLY Bad!,There aren't many movies that I rent that I wont' be able to make it through it. This was one of them. Turned it off half way through because it was so bad. Laugh lines were scarce and bad movie plot was in abundance. Very disappointed.
5,Dark Shadows Rule,Nice take on a modern day Dark Shadows. I have been a fan since I was a kid; rushed home from grade school to watch it at 3:30 every day. Also watched all the Ben Cross renditions. This a delightfully light and modern take on a show that is an icon. LOVE IT.
4,Dark Shadows,This movie was cute and funny!! I suggest that it is a good movie to sit and watch once the outside weather gets awful. Johnny Depp is hysterical in this Dark Shadows movie.
2,"Lame, Cheesy.","Not what I expected. Was cheesy and lame. One of the few bad Depp movies I have seen (maybe the only bad one). Just over the top, the teen girls secret was just to cheesy. Wanted it to be much better. Failed to meet expectations."
2,Dark Shadows the new movie,I loved the show dark shadows as a kid and had been re-watching old episodes in anticipation of the movie - what a disappointment!Although I thought all the actors were great the plot was terrible! Way too much screen time was spent on poking fun at the 70's rather than developing good characters and interesting plots.This was such a missed opportunity - how could anyone lack for plot ideas with all the multiple story arcs that went on during the shows time on day time TV - Dan Curtis must be rolling in his grave - with the appropriate music no doubt.
4,Funny and highly enjoyable,"Not an incredible movie, but I thought it was funny and had a compelling storyline. The acting and cinematography was also good and made the film a pleasure to watch."
3,dark comedy,I only watched this movie because I like Depp's comedy. It wasn't your typical vampire movie that have been coming our fast and furious out of hollywood. A bit quirky hence Johnny Depp. Got nothing to do watch this movie & chuckle.
3,It's just OK,"Love Johnny Depp but Expected much more fun and laughs from this one, kinda boring and almost didn't make it to the end."
3,Average movie,Not as good as most Tim Burton films but it was still a good movie to watch. Was a little slow in some scenes. Wouldn't watch again but glad I saw nonetheless.
4,"If you like Johnny Depp's comedy, you will like Dark Shadows",A funny movie that is almost over the top comical. A good scary comedy if you like that kind of movie.
2,Slow and boring! Very little humor.,Very disappointing. I expected either humor or horror and it was neither. Johnny Depp was the only minor interesting character. Save your money and rent something else!
5,Awesome movie from an awesome show...,"People have complained that the movie is a parody of the original show, but I don't agree...certainly it has a lot of humorous moments, but it also has its share of dramatic scenes. I would term this as a 'dramedy.'The cast is great, especially Johnny Depp as Barnabas and Michelle Pfeiffer as Elizabeth, and especially considering they both had some really big shoes to fill from Jonathan Frid and Joan Bennett, the original Barnabas and Elizabeth from the show.Eva Green is deliciously nasty as Angelique, but she also shows she still has a soft spot in her 'love' for Barnabas despite the fact she has managed to ruin his family for generations in revenge for his rejecting her.This is a wonderful tribute to an iconic show at least in my opinion. I can watch it over and over again."
2,Dark Shadows,"Awful film, thoroughly disappointed given its fantastic cast.Not worth paying to see, I'd wait until its free on prime :("
3,It's ok...,It reminded me more of the Addam Family than it did Dark Shadows. I would have rather had the drama over the comedy on this one....
2,A boring Tim Burton movie?,Whoever heard of such a thing? But here it is - a boring vampire. I just never cared about these characters. You can't treat monsters like regular folks.
1,Silly movie,I was expecting it to be funnier. I would suggest skipping this movie since it didn't deliver what I thought.
1,Not so good...,"This was a very dumb movie, I should have listened to the other ratings but figured I would give it a try.. oh well"
5,dark shadows dvd,Great movie! well to me anyway! some people might not like it but I thought it was a good movie! kind of dark and funny at times! love the music on this movie too!
2,Depp = Crapp,"Library rental. Subtley ironic and really bad soap opera? Definitely not comedy, supernatural, horror or romance. Nothing at all like the movie trailer would suggest.Lacks the love or revenge or any plot element of most vampire stories, or any real emotional connection period. Pretty boring actually. Oh yeah, he's a vampire, he's just pale, I sorta forgot.Depp's deadpanning is as if William Hung (American Idol super-reject) were playing the character of Charie Harper. But without the good hair and charming self-depreciation, or any talent, or supporting comedic actor.And the daughter... a half-second reveal at the end ""wait, I'm really werewolf""' and zero followup? WTH?I was once forced to watched Finding Nemo, which was completely sappy, and it was far far superior to this."
3,Meh,Fun concept. Tim Burton's hand is all over it. Fun vehicle for Mr. Depp. Probably not something I'd want to see a 2nd. time.
3,Funny but the romance was so lame,I enjoyed a lot of this movie but it left a bad taste in my mouth that even though he loved the girl he kept making out with anything else that looked at him sideways. Stupid.
3,Its OK...,I did like it. but it should have gone into more detail i am sure there will be a sequel to this movie.It was funny and a good story how ever i have never scene the show it was a remake of? so i can not compare it for you.
3,Dark Shadows,"I would have given 4 stars for cast, production, sets, etc., but the script was rather lame and the ending wrapped up nothing...just left me wondering where the end of the movie was."
2,No Shadow,"Johnny Depp was worth the rental. Found his role amusing but not enough ""camp"" to save this movie. Watch the original to enjoy the drama and humor."
3,Very much a Burton/Depp movie,"I am giving this movie 3 stars because I was expecting more. I am a fan of both Depp and Burton and really enjoy their collaborations. This one was just not what I was expecting. There were many places they started down an interesting path and then just dropped the ball. In my opinion it was trying to be a comedy and a horror movie, but missed both paths completely. Maybe if it had picked one and used all its energy in that direction, it would have made a better impression. I can not honestly say it was bad, but I can't say it was good either. If you have 2 hours to kill, it will do the trick and not give you nightmares."
3,Another okay Tim Burton John Depp collaboration,Thought it would be more of a comedy.I still think that it is worthy of my collection.The price was right!
3,Creepy Movie,The acting in this movie was great and the movie was fine up until the end where things got creepy real fast!
3,Ehhh,"Well, I love Johnny Depp an Vampire flicks, so I thought I would love this. It was just okay. There were a few parts that made me laugh, I watched the whole movie, but I won't be rushing to watch this again. Even though it was PG-13 I thought it pushed those lines a bit, there were some awkward moments as I watched ths with my daughters."
3,mixed feelings,Not my favorite Depp/BurtonThe trailer showed the whole highlights of the movie so there were few clever surprises. I did enjoy the special effects and makeup/costuming and the overall look. The doctor was interesting.
3,It was ok,"I'm kind of bummed we paid to rent this. It wasn't worth the $. It was ok, but I won't be watching it again."
3,Good entertainment,"This movie was pretty good, there wasn't much of a plot, but the characters were funny and the movie was a good rental. I would recommend it to a friend."
3,Passable entertainment,"Always a joy to watch Johnny Depp, and the role of Barnabas Collins is a good one for him, but overall the movie lacks any solid storyline, the performances aside from Depp are weak and it's a disappointing effort by Tim Burton, who seems much better at animated flicks than live."
3,OK,"This video was ok, they could have done alot better. It had it's funny parts but not like it could have."
1,bad plot,"It was not funny, it was weirdly sexual, and the story line was not good. I would not recommend it."
4,Not what I expected,"This movie was good, just not what I was expecting. I rented it because my kids wanted to watch it but regrettably, I had to kick my kids out of the room!!! If thats what you were thinking to do, think again, and as funny as it was at times, the movie was kinda dark too."
2,Meh.,"Meh. Just meh. Nothing special. I can see where the director was trying to go with the direction of this movie but unfortunately, he missed the mark and the end result is that this movie is just ""meh"". I wouldn't see it again, even if it came on cable and there was noting else on."
1,Totally Boring,"The worst of Hollywood............so very stupid and the acting is Z rate........boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring."
1,dark shadows.,This was not Tim Burton's or Johnny Depp's best. I found it way too campy and hard to watch. Sorry.
4,Review,Campy. What can I say. The actors were having more fun I think. The audience was there to provide the coins.
4,Thought it was very good,"I thought the movie was really good. I never saw the first Dark Shadows movie, probably never will. Many are comparing it to the first, but without the comparison I though it was very entertaining."
1,What a waste.,Top of my list of movies I wish I DIDN'T purchase at full price. *shakes head* It wasn't funny or entertaining. I didn't see the point.
4,Does not Sux!,"Depp fans will get a kick out of it, plus its entertainment value. I do hope they follow up, as there are some things left hanging and wish they would've touched more on...Good collaboration (like always) between Depp and Burton."
3,Huge Tim Burton/Johnny Depp fan - but undewhelmed,"Since I am such a huge fan of the Tim Burton genre, and I'm pretty sure I've seen everything Johnny Depp was in, i was really looking forward to this movie. My opinion - it was ok. Its not a terrible movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it just felt crammed. I know this is based off of a 70's cult soap opera, and when you watch the movie you will see they tried to put the entire series within less than 2 hours. I've never seen the original soap, and for those who have, you might enjoy this movie a little more, but over all- underwhelmed. Very hard for me to say this since I love Tim Burton and Johnny Depp with just about everything."
2,A bit boring....,"I usually enjoy this combination of actors & directors, but in this case I could not stay awake to the end."
4,Dark shadows,Johnny Depp's transformation was phenomenal. It was very nastalgic for me. For those of us that remember the TV series. I enjoyed it.
4,Dark Shadows - 2012 Movie,"Being a fan of the original 1960's series - but even more of a fan of the 1991 remake series on NBC, it took a couple of viewings for me to ""get it"". Depp is not bad as Barnabas. He is missing a certain intensity, depth and clarity, butoverall Depp has enough of a command of the character to carry this movie. There is just too much background, family history and missing character development to try to pack into one movie. Critical plot points are glossed over, missing or not fleshed out enough for us to to really get involved with Barnabas, Roger Collins, Carolyn and David the way we should.I love the porcelain doll effects on Angelique - totally amazing. I also love the Liverpool segments in the beginning.Maybe a 3hr movie would've translated better, but I give Tim Burton and Depp very high marks for decent film...."
4,Dark Shadows,Starts out slow but you get more involved as it goes on. Great visual effects.Like Johnny Depp movies always entertaining.
2,Kind of boring,I was disappointed in this. I expected something smarter and funnier. It was just a bit boring.Johnny Depp didn't see to be putting an effort into his performance.
4,Funny and good,I love Johnny Depp and as a child I watched the soap Dark Shadows. I thought the movie was well done and I had an enjoyable evening and was very much entertained. What more could you ask for. Enjoy!
4,good silly fun,I kept hearing bad things about this movie even from Tim Burton fans but this movie turned out to be really good it was just what we expected silly fun and entertaining good movie to watch.
3,not as funny as i thought it would be,Just not as good as i hoped...but i did enjoy the movie. I was expecting it to be funnier. Wait for it to come on cable.
3,Johnny and Tim again :/,Its not to long and not too short its just the story line isnt really well constructed. You get the goth or creepy feeling from like all Tim Burtons films yet the movie wasnt that funny and in most of the other films Tim does a good job showing the development of the characters and their feelings in this one its more choppy.
3,"Shucks, didn't pan out...","I watched it almost all the way through -- it had promise & on that, I kept watching. But alas, i fell asleep & tried to reconnect at that point that I did. But couldn't. I would have been very disappointed if I paid the movie price; but at the $3.99 price -- I can live with that. No fancy mojo on the who, what, when, where, why this movie didn't make it. I'm just glad I didn't pay more than I did. And, fwiw: part of it was okay, until I fell asleep....zzzzzz."
1,Sniff sniff,"I was really disappointed in this film. I have watched every movie and tv episode of the old series and was hoping this movie would bring that back. The problem was that the old series was a drama, not a comedy. As much as I love Johnny Depp, this was a failure and a waste of money"
3,Good Not Great,"I am a big fan of Depp/Burton but I felt like the story was lacking. The base of the story was good but I think Burton failed at bringing this one together, which is a shame because the casting was good."
3,Not bad.,"I love all the actors in this movie, it's goofy brain candy. If you only enjoy Oscar worthy films this is not for you. However, if you enjoy a fun ride with Depp, check it out."
3,Not Best,"Even though some heavy hitters in the film, not best by all involved. Wanted better storyline and plot.It filled the silence for an evening."
3,"Watchable, entertaining, not a favorite","This movie tried to jam-pack all of the original TV series into one movie, which didn't work very well. I will say it was entertaining and it made me want to look into the original series, because it looks pretty great (This movie acts as a sort of teaser for the series.)"
3,Dark Shadows,I was not thrilled by the video. Johnny Depp was great as always but the characters were to phony. Growing up I watched the series and this was a bad movie. It just didn't have the feeling of what I remember. It was good if all you wanted was laughs but I wan't impressed with it.
4,not a Tim Burton fan,"by any means but this one is a winner, although i'm not sure how he can make his wife HB Carter look as hideous as she does in this one and still be married to her, but that's for them to sort out. Michelle Pfieffer does almost as well with comedy as she did in Hairspray and the soundtrack with the Moody Blues and the Carpenters stands on its own. i almost expected Lynn Anderson's ""Never promised you a rose garden,"" it's that 70's. Eva Green, so good in the Dreamers and Casino Royale is stunning as femme fatale Angelique (or was it Angel?). Some parts are too graphic for kids and the kids in this movie aren't of the sheltered variety but all in all, good fun. Johnny Depp has some good oneliners and even when he doesn't, he seems to do wry irony well, even if unspoken. Watched this one more times than i care to count."
2,"Depp takes a dip, worst one ever, disappointed","I was disappointed in this production. The script was loosely wooven and the plot was rushed not allowing any time for humor or theme to develop. Johnny Depp could not save the lack of well written comedy/drama. The movie gave the appearance of being thrown together hoping that star quality would save it. Worst direction I have seen, really murdered Dark Shadows without any farse relief in sight. It goes to show that doing it for the money can do you in. I guess Johnny has lost his feel for art."
2,A slight disappointment,I was slightly disappointed with the film. The could have done so much more with it. All the funny parts were shown on the trailer which was sad. I guess I might have expected too much from the main character. A lot of blood with not a whole lot of fun.
2,Boring,I am usually a big fan of Depp and Burton films but this was soooo boring. Please don't waste your money on this garbage story which just drags out to a stupid ending.
1,not worth your time,"I'm not sure if the movie was going for comedy or drama, but either way it completely failed as entertaining!"
4,Love anything Johnny Depp,"We really enjoyed the movie- had a lot of laughs. I think there'll be a part 2, but not sure we'd be into it"
4,Better than I expected,"Lets face it, Dark Shadows (the original soap opera) was a campy little oddity from 60s/70s day-time television. Nobody really expects much from it. This remake has much better production values (how could it not?) but the writers for the remake have actually come up with a very enjoyable tail about characters that you come to truly care about by the end of the movie. Treat yourself and give it a spin."
3,Expected so much more,"Really did expect so much more from this movie. I love the actors and director, but could have been better."
3,Had so much potential,"It was still funny, but could have been so much better. Dissappointed, but glad I didn't pay to see it in the theaters."
3,good not great,I love Johnny Depp and I like Tim Burton movies so overall it was good. Funny 1970's pop culture references but I think if I had watched the 1970's TV show I might have gotten more of the jokes. I don't think it will be one of the films I would watch again. Certainly not one I would watch over and over again. It was worth the $3.
3,Average,"Well I never saw the original show this is named after ,but this movie was just alright. Nothing in this film will have you on the edge of your seat ,and though it is suppose to be funny the best I got was a smile but no haha funny. Rent if you like Johnny Depp ,or vampire stuff. On a side note it is way better than Twilight by a mile..lol."
3,DISAPPOINTING,"Even Johnny Depp could not save this movie. i didn't find it funny, serious or interesting. Just a lot of stuff going on."
2,Expected More Humor,I was disappointed in this movie. I expected it to be more humorous than it really was. I'm glad I waited to rent it rather than see it in the theaters.
3,Eh,"Movie was not what I expected. I was expecting a little more forward humor, but many times was left a little sleepy. Must admit I was not familiar with the original series so it could be my fault for expecting too much."
4,Not as bad as I thought,"In short, it was funny and had a loose knit to it. I thought Depp would be like all his other Burton characters, but this one was just plain odd and original. Not too familiar with the original TV series, but this one seemed to follow the teleplay lead. Michelle Phifer was hot and the other characters were fairly silly. I felt an eerie sense of mortality at the end. It worked for me as I watched it around Halloween, so maybe it is a seasonal thing?"
5,Funny,I do love this movie because it's Johnny Depp...come on who doesn't love him? I mean I know it's not the old show that everyone loved but it does have it's own qualities that make it great. :)
2,SLOOOOOWWWWWWW!,I found myself wondering when the story was going to get going only to realize it was an hour in. This was neither funny or dark. I couldn't even finish it. A disappointment and I am usually a super fan of Depp and Burton.
3,Dark Shadows,An ok movie but I had to see some parts twice because I fell asleep while watching it. I would not go to the theatre to see this movie.
4,"Dark Shadows, Dark Comedy",Tim Burton and Johnny Depp did a wonderful job bringing the 1960s gothic soap opera into the modern world. I think both the fans of the original show and the kids and grandkids of the original fans will get a kick out of this over-the-top campy dark comedy. Trivia......Johnny Depp and Alice Cooper who also appears in this film are distant cousins. Wonder if they know it?This film is not really appropriate for kids younger than sixteen because it has some gory and raunchy qualities to it.
2,"A disappointment whether you are a Dark Shadows fan, Johnny Depp fan, or are a child of the early 70's","A disappointment whether you are a Dark Shadows fan, Johnny Depp fan, or are a child of the early 70's."
2,Stinker,This movie certainly did not live up to its potential. The storyline raced through without stopping to let us care about any of the characters. There was no development of the love story. It was not funny. Depp overacted and played his part as a caricature in such a way as to make the character brittle and cold. Poorly done!
3,"rating is for the product, not the film","Okay, some people like the Depp/Burton formula, and some don't. Personally, I liked this movie for what it was. But that is not the intention of my review. I am concerned about the quality of the bluray. Does anyone else's bluray jerk in places? I'm not talking about panning shots, but I mean in just normal scenes, the film will jump a little. My bluray is up-to-date on its firmware and other discs do not have a problem. I'm wondering if its just the disc itself, or if there is something I can do to make it play better??"
1,ZZZZZZ,I was bored with this movie 10 mins in i wouldnt recommend anyone to buy or rent it. WOOT WOOT
3,Not as good as I expected it to be,"I was disappointed. With Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, you usually get a good cheeky comedy. This one just didn't do it. There were a couple of good bits, but otherwise, just ok."
3,Dark Shadows,"I LOVE Johnny Depp in just about every movie he's ever been in however, I couldn't figure out if this movie was supposed to be scary of funny. Because, it really wasn't much of either.I'm glad I watched it but if you miss it you won't have really missed much.I feel it could have been so much more but something was holding it back."
1,Terrible,"Started off ok but just made no sense. Wasted use of Michelle Pfiefer (who basically disappears), Helena Bonham Carter, and Johnny Depp for that matter. This was a fun premise with which they could of done a zillion things - even something formulaic -- but I think the writers lost interest and just let it become a dud."
3,Lighter Side of Dark Shadows,"Tim Burton fans will enjoy this lighthearted remake of the Dark Shadows' series from the 1970's. Those who did see the original will be somehwhat let down. It is worth the viewing for comparison sake alone. This was a hit during the 70's when I remember people rushing back to the dorms to see the show and housewife's were hooked on Barnabus Collins, resident vampire. Over the years the show has come back for reruns and has a large cult following.I would not seeing it again but I doubt a TV run since they are pushing the DVD complete set for sale. If you get a chance wtach it, but I don't know if you wnat to fork out the hundrerds the serries is goijng for at this time."
3,Very low quality story line,"This movie had one or two redeeming moments, but suffice it to say the best parts were in the previews (shocker). Mostly it was a lot of sex and sex appeal, and cat and mouse. There wasn't even a resolution to the story - not to mention the horrible acting. If I were you and you really wanted to see this movie, wait until you get a free redbox code, don't waste $3 or $4 dollars on it."
4,My Name Is Victoria Winters...,"Okay, I did NOT expect to like this one in the least. I am a major Dark Shadows (original TV series) fan. The trailer of this looked like it was a total spoof so I've avoided it like the plague. I LOVE Johnny Depp and like a lot of Tim Burton's films. Not all, but, many. This one totally blew my mind. The trailer was a TERRIBLE depiction of the film. It depicted it as an all out comedy which it really doesn't have much comedic elements when you watch the film. I bet the studio decided to package it that way in hopes of selling it as a comedy. The dodos don't get it. Dark Shadows fans are many and true. All they succeeded in doing was warding off the die hard fans, like myself, until fate steps in and they see it as it really is. A tribute to a beloved TV classic. Now it isn't exactly like Dark Shadows either but it is a Dark Shadows I could like and even learn to love. So if you've not given it a try do so, you may be pleasantly surprised!"
5,Fantastic!,Love the movie! Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter rock the screen as usual. Full of laughs and kookiness just like the old tv show.
3,Just okay...,"After watching the previews, I had slightly higher expectations for this movie, but sadly, all the best parts were in the reviews."
3,MOVIE REVIEW,"MOVE WAS A TAD BORING IN PLACES. NOT ONE OF JOHNNY DEPPS BEST MOVIES, ALTHOUGH FUNNY AT TIMES. NOT GREAT BUT OKAY."
3,Rental only,"My wife and I wanted to see this when it came out in theaters. We never had the chance to go and instead decided to stream it on Amazon. We were disappointed. We both like Burton and Depp, but the movie seemed to be lacking. No spoilers here, but it ends rather abruptly and there's really no build up to justify the ending."
2,Depp and Burton Disappoint in a Beautiful Fashion,"2 and 1/4 stars if I could: this, like their Alice in Wonderland, was visually fun and mildly entertaining plot-wise. Not as clever, humorous or darkly melancholic as I would have liked, the costuming and sets were still greatly enjoyed."
5,Dark Shadows,"My baby sister and I had a rare evening out together and went to see this movie. Remembering the original ""soap opera"" that was one TV every week day, I literally laughed from the first scene to the last! Is a 'must have' for my late son Chase's ""WALL O DVD'S"" (video library= some 500 dvd's by now!) Awesome Tim Burton adaptation!"
1,Wasted Time,The previews for this movie were comedic however there was nothing funny about this morbid tale. Would not recommend nor watch again.
5,A perfect 11PM Friday film,"The actors, all of them, do a wonderful job. Mr Burton has done it again. This is a winner movie to rent while sucking down a few beers late at night. If you plan to buy it, you're an idiot. This film you can only watch once."
1,Completely Ridiculous and a waste of time,"We didn't have very high expectations when renting this movie, but did think that it might be kind of campy and fun, given the cast. We were wrong. The cast is totally wasted here and they all appear to be sleep-walking through their roles. The only one who looks like he's having any fun is Alice Cooper, but he's not on screen for long enough to make any difference. If you must see this, wait until it comes on regular cable for free and even if they do the usual editing for length and content, you won't be missing much."
3,Okay,Not my favorite Tim burton movie. I normally love the Tim burton/ Johnny depp movies but this movie was a little to werid for me to get into.
3,Another Vampire Story,"It was a bit boring and repetitve! Although I enjoy J. Depp, this movie didn't do him justice! I enjoyed his make up though!"
2,Poor Quality,"I saw this in theaters and liked it enough to rent it when it came out, but the sound was horrible. There is no captioning option and the background noise and music overpower the spoken words making it impossible to enjoy."
3,Not the best,"This movie was not as funny as I had hoped, and was fairly slow and boring through a large portion of it. Overall, I was not very impressed."
3,"Good, but not for kids!!!!","The acting is very good in this film, but keep the kids under 13 out of the room! We made the mistake of watching as a family and my 11 and 8 year olds were very frightened. It has funny parts, but it is more scary than you would think."
3,OK,"Not as good as I had hoped, but entertaining none the less. Will not watch it again or buy the dvd."
3,Not my favorite Johnny Depp movie.,"I am so mixed about this film I am not sure what to write. When the movie started off, I thought this is going to be really good. Unfortunately as the movie went on I just lost interest. Not enough to turn it off, but this definitely was not my favorite Johnny Depp movie."
1,very slow,"I really wanted to like it, but it was so slow. I liked the look of it, and think it had a lot of potential, but not enough story there."
1,Tim Burton's Worst Effort,Just a very poorly written and directed movie. Absolutely stinker of a plot. Previews looked better. Stay away from this one.
5,Thing that go bump!,Great fun and hilarious - Johnny Depp is an amazing talent and an incredible comedian; he is bizarre and elegant and absorbing!
1,Not the Movie...It's the Process,"No Ultraviolet digital copying for me.....Let a bad taste in my video Library. Not compatible with the viewers I commonly used, download requires hundreds of files which are proprietary and not easily transferred."
2,"Lame. As is becoming more common, Johnny Depp's movies stink","This is a great idea poorly executed. All invloved are getting lazy and sloppy. I miss the old Johnny Depp. I am so over the eye rolling, oddly familiar performance. He is becoming a one note joke."
4,You should watch this,It is a really good movie and a well done mix of humor and special effects. It is a definite must watch.
3,Fair,Rather boring. Nothing like the old shows that use to be on t.v. I bought this because of Johnny Depp being in it.
3,a little dry,"the acting was done well, but the story line was a little dry. the video feed was good. i would not watch it again."
3,Not what expected,"The movie was o.k, but not fantastic. It just didn't have anything that was memorable or fantastic about it. Chalk it up to I watched it, not the best and not the worse.If you watch it I hope you enjoy it ."
3,Its Okay...,"I thought this was an alright movie..seems like they showed all the really funny parts in the previews for it. Normally I am a big Johnny Depp fan but this was not one of my favorites.. worth watching I guess, but I wouldn't watch it again. Too bad cause it had a great cast.. I think they previewed it too much.. Don't worry Johnny I'm still a big fan..lol!"
3,Yawn,"Spoiler alert. Michelle saves herself from her suddenly animated house by shooting it with a shotgun. And thats as good as this one got. Well cast, well directed, great costumes...but nothing can overcome a mediocre script. Sigh."
3,Dark Shadows,"I am a J. Depp fan, so ofc i liked this movie.I would rate it as being kind of likeDeath Becomes her"
2,Was not impressed,"I loved Johnny Depp's movies, but I was disappointed about this one. The actors and actresses are good but the plot is boring"
5,Another Johhny Depp winner,The movie was very entertaining and as always Johnny Depp delivered an outstanding performance. I would watch again and again!!!
2,Dark Shadows,"I kept waiting for the movie to start getting good. I love Tim Burton, John Depp & Helena Bonham Carter. But what they showed in the trailers were the best parts of this movie - very disappointing.I rented the HD version, and it kept buffering, and when it stared to play, it was no longer in HD. I have had this happen before - it is hit or miss w/renting Amazon HD."
4,Dark Shadows,"Entertaining and funny. Some of the suprises were actually hallarious. There were some slow parts but all in all it is a treat to watch with popcorn, a drink and someone to laugh with or even alone."
2,Boring,"Saw the previews for Dark Shadows when it was in the theaters and thought it would be funny and enjoyable to watch. Didn't plan on seeing it in the theater and opted to either rent it or stream it. Definitely glad I didn't waste my money on it in the theater and regret spending the $3.99 to stream it. Not even sure I would be happy to have spent $1.00 at Redbox on it.Based on the previews I was expecting a comedy. While there were a few lines that I didn't see in the previews it definitely wasn't a comedy. It wasn't even frightening. Honestly don't know what to call it except boring. I am reminded of a Brad Paisley video where Shatner comments after Brad questions what he (Shatner) thought of the video. Shatner said ""I liked the end... when the music stopped."". Well I never have seen a movie where I was glad to see the credits. Sadly I had to wake myself up a little just to realize the movie had ended. I would call it the sleeper hit of 2012... literally."
5,"Different Mood, but great",It was a little darker than his usual movies but it was still funny and I'm glad I brought it! I suggest owning it.
3,Not Your Father's Dark Shadows,I went in to watching this movie with low expectations. I remember watching several of the original episodes on TV and knew it was not going to be like that. As a standalone movie it was OK and better than I thought it would be. The best part of the entire show was watching the red `Cuda' drive around.
1,Horrible,We rented this for my sister's birthday and it is not funny in the least and it very dark. Not meant for kids.
1,if I could give it less stars I would!,"I painfully watched the whole movie hopeing the ending would justify sitting through the whole movie, but alas, I discovered I should have shut of the movie sooner. the story is in my mind what killed the movie, for it was well was there a story? it is definatly not your basic story line were you invest in some characters to the conclusion, for the movie seems to deviate from characters you think should be more prominant then it deviates back to them then leaves again, an focuses on something else. my first thought after watching it was that the editor of the film must have been high on something, for basically the story is horrible put together. don't waste your time unless you could care less about the story."
1,Horrible movie,"I haven't been too fond of Mr. Burton's work for several years, but this takes the cake. He takes a cult classic, a horror soap opera whose cheesy fun factor was the fact that actors, writers and directors took everything seriously while working on a horror soap opera, and turned into one of his idiotic menagerie of weirdness and oddities. The only saving grace in this movie was Eva Green. Everyone else, from Burton's partner in crime Johnny Depp to the kids were all miscast. That includes Mr. Burton himself. Run from this movie, unless you are a masochist."
1,Dark Shadows Disapointment,"This movie is poorly written, not funny and has no relation to the television series whatsoever. I was really looking forward to this movie and was saddened to find that it was poorly written and appeared that its creators had never seen the original Dark Shadows television series. The humor was lame and predictable and the story was poorly conceived and acted. Do not waste your money on this trash."
1,"So bad, don't do it....","It's really that bad, not funny at all. Just watch the trailer, its better then the entire movie... A witch and a vampire fighting over a cannery (fish, it just sounds fun right?)? Didn't know that was the plot line? How would you from the preview, but yup, that's it."
1,So so so soooooo BAD,"One of the top 5 worst films I have ever ever ever had the displeasure to snooze through. The tone established during the first few minutes is promising. After that, it finds new lows to sink to with each scene - well, I slept through the last half so maybe it redeemed itself. Honestly, this thing actually made me feel kind of sick like I was getting the flu or something. Yes. It's that bad. And I hate saying it because I adore JD and admire TB's other films. WTF happened ??? Bad writing! Bad make up!! Sheesh. I'll shut up now cuz I'm sure u get the pic. It's BAD."
1,Don't waste your time,"I was very disappointed in this movie. I am a big Dark Shadows and Jonny Depp fan and although his performance was good. The movie was silly and boring. The movie was very campy but it just didn't come through. It was not funny where it was supposed to be. Boring, Boring Boring."
4,Loved it,We enjoyed this Johnny Depp movie. I would watch it again. It was dark funny. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp work Great together.
1,Take heed : waste not thy funds upon this trash!,"Let me declare that I am a big fan of Burton, Depp, and the original series. Furthermore I was ""down"" for a campy salute to the original and was fully aware it would be ""different"". But this movie fails as entertainment on every level because it is a mess...its characters, its plot, its make-up, its special effects, its humor(or lack thereof) and I dare say its music (yes I lived through the seventies I recall fondly many tunes from the era but many from this film should have been trimmed).Perhaps saddest part of all is: this disaster of a movie will likely sink forever the possibility of a ""true"" Dark Shadows picture...for fans of the old series (I rushed home every day from school to watch!) that is truly tragic.So take heed, don't be stubborn like I was, read the other negative reviews and turn away in horror lest you fill your shopping cart with crap!!!(and save your money)"
2,NOT REALLY FOR DARK SHADOW FANS,EVEN THOUGH I BOUGHT THIS I DONT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE ITS YOUR TYPICAL TIM BURTON MOVIE. NOT MUCH OF THE MOVIE REALLY KEPT WITH THE ORIGINAL SHOW AND A FEW OF THE ORIGINAL CAST MEMEMBERS HAD VERY SMALL PART ALL THEY DID WAS JUST WALK INTO THE PARTY. AND WHO EVER HEARD OF HAVING ALICE COOPER IN THE MOVIE.
2,No good at all,I would have gave it one star but there was a couple parts that made me lol. Other then the couple funny parts it was a horrible movie and a waste of my time. Disappointed in Tim Burton.
5,What a great movie,"I was a big fan of the original show of Dark shadows. In fact I have it on my Instant que from Netflix. This movie was a great remake.I loved the music on it. It brought back memories of the music I listened to when I was a lot younger. The acting was great and the story line was easy to follow.It looks like there may be a sequel and I hope if there is, it is as good as the first one.I have this one downloaded on my Kindle Fire and watch it often. I really like this movie."
2,Disappointing,We were hoping for a little bit more substance or laughs or drama or horror or suspense or just about anything from this lackluster movie. Michelle Pfeiffer wasn't on screen long enough and the ending was so open ended with little closure or satisfaction. A real disappointment.
4,Fun movie!,"I enjoyed this show, especially the ""60's"" camera style, gave it a Rosemary's baby effect. I watched the original, but love Johnny Depp."
4,Funny Moments,I have seen Johnny do a lot better work but for the theme of this movie I think it was good. There were some wtf moments and sometimes the movie felt like it paused on certain scenes when they were not important or rushed through more fun ones. Over all though everyone should at least rent it. I will not be running out to buy this one though.
2,This was not a good movie,"This was a painful movie to sit through. I watched it on a flight. I love Johnny Depp, but this was a bad movie. The timing was slow, it was hard to follow and there was no emotional investment in any of the characters. It also was not funny."
1,I hated it. :(,I really disliked this movie. I thought it was supposed to be a spoof of the original show. It wasn't funny. It wasn't scary. It just totally felt like it missed the mark on everything. I definitely wasn't impressed.
3,OK,"It was an ok movie nothing spectacular. There were some funny moments here and there, its a decent watch. I would watch again just not very soon."
2,dark shadows,Light and silly but not really funny. I wanted either more meat or more laughs. It passed the time on my flight.
2,We did not enjoy it,It was not as funny as the commercials made it look; we were disapointed and did not enjoy watching it.
1,Thought this was terrible!,Johnny is poorly used in this awful film - weird bad ending too............could have been so much better....a wastle of the great actors in it.
2,Don't waste your time,This one was just an excuse for Tim Burton to put heavy makeup on Depp. The best part was that the movie wasn't longer.
4,Better than I thought it would be,I am a big fan of the old Dark Shadows series and wasn't sure about this movie before I saw it. I have to say I did enjoy it though as I'm also a Tim Burton/Johnny Depp fan and they did a decent job. It was a bit too condensed and although they used a lot of the story line they did change things a bit and didn't explain a few key things such as why was Julia Hoffman living at Collinwood and why she was the drinker. That's just an example of the differences. I wonder what someone who has never seen the series would think of the movie and curious to read a review by such a person. Overall though it was very entertaining and that's why I'm giving it 4 stars though it's more of a 3.5 for me. Fun.
3,Dark Shadows,"It was an enjoyable movie, although a lot of the funny parts were shown in the trailer. Depp has done better work, but it's still an enjoyable movie to watch."
2,boring,"I know it doesn't seem possible, but this movie was a bore. Poor J. Depp, way over the top as usual but this time it didn't work."
4,what can I say its Johnny Depp,This was a fun romp but I wish there had been more character developement. I never saw the series it is based on so I don't know how accurate it is but it stands alone as a quick comedy worth a few laughs.
2,johnny,"johnny johnny johnny, please care about your career again and stop making Tim Burton movies!! Stupid movie. Really Stupid Movie."
2,Not what I expected.,I was disappointed in this movie. I was expecting more. It has a couple funny lines. I wanted to watch it because of Johnny Depp.
3,Not As Good As The Original TV Series,"I personally liked the original TV series better than this film and the Revival TV series in the 1990's decade starring Ben Cross. Although I feel that Johnny Depp did a better job than Ben Cross in playing the role of Barnabas, I still feel that Jonathan Frid on the original TV series was the best of all. Jonathan Frid played the role of Barnabas so well that I don't feel that he could ever be surpassed by any other actors. There were some differences in this film compared to the original series such as Barnabas telling Elizabeth Collins Stoddard his secret which he didn't tell Elizabeth in the original TV series. Some of the photography in this film was good and modernized. As one other reviewer said, the original TV series in the 1960's was a success because of the conversations and dialogues taking place between the characters. I feel that the original TV series can never be surpassed because of its own uniqueness."
2,"No ""Legend of Sleepy Hollow""","Hoping this would be aligned with the terrific job that Burton and J. Depp pulled off with ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" sorely disappointed. The best I can say is my time wasn't completely wasted, but the one liners of Barnabus did not make a good movie, won't watch again."
2,Poor story,"The movie lacked a plot or at least the execution. It failed to capture my imagination and full attention. The comedic attempts fell flat, and the movie just plain failed!"
3,Was expecting more,"It was an okay movie, but I don't know that I would take the time to watch it again. Love Depp, but this was just not up to par. Seller provided the product on time and in great condition."
4,dark shadows,I bought this movie for my daughter and she says it's a really good movie and she would recommend it to anyone that likes Johnny Depp.
4,Good one,"In my opinion, this a good video, it is loosely based on the original series. It is what I would call a ""dark comedy"" type of video, for that reason it's not one that I would recommend to everyone."
5,Nice twist on the story!,Linda here and not my husband Carlisle writing this review.Loved it! This was a nice twist on the usual vampire stories and lots of fun mingled in with the scary stuff!
4,Fun but a little let down,"Nothing specifically was wrong in my opinion, but it didn't live up to the advertisements. The funniest parts were used in the trailers."
4,Nifty,"Dark Shadows was a nifty little film, with all the requisite Johnny Depp moments (he's the reason I saw it to begin with.) I expected Helena Bonham Carter to have a much bigger role, but she was still good. The other characters are somewhat shallow, and the ending forced. See it if you've got time and money to spare."
2,Poor script. Meh.,"As much as I love Johnny Depp, and as much as Depp throws himself into this movie, it just still kinda sucks. I also love Eva Green -- A LOT but that also doesn't help. The script just sucks, plain and simple. The plot sucks. A limp, lifeless movie."
3,I was hoping it would be funnier,I was hoping it would be funnier. It was enjoyable and all the pop culture references were cute. Also the special effects were good. But there were lots of predictable stuff and Depp was too droll for my taste.
3,Could be funnier.,"Lacks in authentic humor, although acting is good and story line hangs together. I was bored at the time and it held up."
3,Another ok movie,"Not quite what the previews made it seem like, but still worth watching. Not Johnny Depp's best movie despite his flawless acting."
3,Not bad; could have been better,"This is an amusing romp, at least from time to time, and you cannot beat the 70s vibe with the music and costumes and the amazing production design. The story lacks, though, despite the actors' best efforts."
3,An okay movie,"Johnny Depp is always funny and will deliver no matter what. The film was predictable at times and did have slow spots, but overall it was pretty funny and enjoyable."
3,a swing and a miss,"I know Hollywood is starved for originality, but mining old TV series isn't working and they can't figure it out. In the same vein as A Team, Starsky/Hutch, Dark Shadows disappoints. It failed to capture the macabre, creepy, campy feel of the TV show. I normally love the Depp/Burton collaborations, but this one fell short. I don't recommend buying it. Maybe as a rental if youre tired of watching Avnegers, but otherwise skip it."
3,Meh,I remember the original TV show scared the heck out of me...Johnny Depp does his best to capture the character of Barnabus Collins and it was fun - but again the writing was a bit uneven and a little to chaotic at the climax - but ok.
3,Expectations that did not deliver.,"I imagine this film was meant to be campy, however it falls short. It is barely witty. The makeup is too obvious and adds to the disappointment."
2,Real disappointment,It couldn't figure out if it was a campy comedy like the Addams Family or a drama like the oldTV show.
2,Kinda of lame,"I actually can't remember much about this movie which I think says a lot. Except for some of the music in the movie, it wasn't very good."
2,"Disappointing. Really, don't waste your money","Awful. Being a Tim Burton film it had its moments--some interesting visuals, a few fun and/or dark moments--but on the whole it was poorly written and entirely forgettable. Ultra-loyal, die hard Burton fans might find this worth watching. If you're one of those, you know you have to see it. For your average fan like me who's grown up loving most of his films but still doesn't want to waste his time or money on a bad movie, you've been forewarned. I think this might well be Burton's worst film to date."
2,ehh...,"I am a big Johnny Depp fan, But not his best work. I really hate when you see the previews for a movie, and it gives away all the good parts. this was the case here. in fact the story line was slow and at times tiring, dosed off the first time i watched it!"
2,Dark Shadows - 2 Stars,"I admire Johnny Depp and the transformations he makes. In his films, he plays the innocent and caught of guard personality well; however, this movie was typically Tim Burton and although I enjoy his earlier works, I have been less than satisfied with this recent films (i.e. Willy Wonka, Alice in Wonderland, etc). I want to like these movies, but I just don't."
2,Dark Shadows movie review,"Being a big fan of Depp, I rented this movie with high hopes only to be dashed by a poor movie with no redeeming entertainment value. Beware."
4,great family movie.,"The movie was funny, and had a plot that keeps you interested. We enjoyed it & hope you do too!!!"
2,Should we expect more...,"Or should Burton have delivered more? The story line is haphazard. The writing is uneven - rarely witty, usually mundane, occasionally just silly. The actors are so terribly self-conscious: ""Oh, we are cute. Oh, we have diddle-dee-dee cutesy makeup. Oh, we are actually getting paid for this and we'll have a nice party soon as it's over."" And worst of all (since I really do think Burton is a very thoughtful film maker), the directing is purposeless. Burton, a talented cast is a terrible thing to waste. But so is an audience.Well, it's not likely Tim Burton will read this, but you might. Save yourself the few dollars.Two stars because it takes place in New England, which I miss more and more as winter approaches."
4,"Great Movie, Future Dwellers!","I saw this movie when it came out in theatres and absolutely loved it! I had always heard about the show(s) and always wnated to see them and then the movie came out. I would reccomend it to anyone! I've already watched it quite a bit now as well. It made me want to watch all the original episodes (which I love as well). Between watching the original series and this movie, I of course make the comparisons and notice the similarities and the differences between them. It also made me want to read the books by Lara Parker as well.However, the reason I give it four stars is, is that it can get slow in some of the parts. It of course still sticks with some of the original series, as well as stray from a certian episode that it's trying to represent.Overall, this movie is really good. It's one movie that I think is really good, it just came out at the wrong time in theatres because of the other movies that were out."
4,Dark Shadows,"This was an entertaining movie. Nothing too extraordinary, but it was a good way to spend a rainy afternoon. Johnny Depp is always good in these roles, but it gets a little tiresome after a while. The movie feels like it's dragging on a bit, but there's enough little funny or interesting parts to keep you into it until the end. I would recommend seeing it, but wouldn't call it a must-see."
1,Horrible movie,"I'm a huge Jonny Depp and Tim Burton fan, but this movie stank! I'm always sorry when this much trouble has gone into making a movie and yet there is no discernable script and plot."
3,Ho Hum,"Tim Burton's ""Dark Shadow's"" was, at best an occasionally funny tribute to a cult television show. I was a fan of the original, and I have been a huge fan of Burton,Depp & Bonham Carter. However this was a mediocre attemp from all three."
3,Not too memorable,"I've been a Tim Burton fan since Pee Wee's Big Adventure but I'm now starting to see that half the time he just thinks you absolutely need to end a film with an action sequence, even....Alice in Wonderland. Dark Shadows is no different. The film has a fantastic cast but Johnny Depp as a man cursed to be a vampire and Eva Green (Casino Royale) as the witch that cursed him are the only ones that don't seem bored.I always found the Addams Family film to be fun despite a thin plot and with Dark Shadows the plot is much thinner and not as near as enjoyable. I only give it a positive review since Burton at least handles the 70's setting well even if he could have done more with it. While Depp is of course ingenious in the lead role. Still, as a Burton film it's his weakest since Planet of the Apes and it would be nice if we got more of the Burton who did greats like BeetleJuice, EdWood, Sleepy Hollow, Big Fish and Sweeny Todd."
4,It's so good it's already missing - lol,This movie was such a hit at my house that my niece came over and borrowed it for a sleepover about a week after I got it & I'm still waiting for it back... It's getting good use - lol
2,"Dark Shadow's, not worth it","Very dissappointed, contrived, rather boring. Only Johnny Depp's character was somewhat interesting and it was far from his best performance"
1,The worse Tim Burton ever,"There was a lot of potential for the story of that movie but it all fell like a soufflé half-way through. A big disappointment in the theatre, I have learned my lesson and will stay (far) away from the hard copy. This is not even a Z movie..."
5,Great!!!,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. Depp brought his own vivacity to the screen with this. Well done.
3,"Average, nothing exceptional",Found it not up to par for Johnny Depp. Kept waiting for it to take off and get exciting/interesting. The play spots on advertisements made it look a lot better than what it actually is.
2,Let Sleeping Vampires Lie,"I am a HUGE fan of the original TV soap opera Dark Shadows. It aired from 1966 to 1971 and was groundbreaking for daytime television. I used to hurry home from school to watch Dark Shadows. It was American Gothic with brooding atmosphere and that famous spooky music. It was not played for laughs.Fast forward to this lame attempt to cash in on Dark Shadow's good name. It should never have happened. Johnny Depp's Barnabus Collins was ridiculous in the white pancake makeup. It was not funny, even though it tried to be."
3,Meh..,"My boyfriend came home with this movie one day as a surprise. I hadn't really cared to watch it because the trailer made it look just so-so. Turns out, the trailer and my guess were right. Of course the acting was good, Johnny Depp and Helen Bonham Carter are always great - especially together - and that new witch lady that hasn't been in much else was good.The plot, however, was just average. The comedy was also just average - I was expecting to laugh a lot more than I did. The love story? Below average. I wasn't feeling the connection at all.If it were up to me, I'd spend about $5 on this movie, and not a penny more. It's a decent one time watch if you're bored."
3,Dark Shadows HD,Johnny as strange as usual...maybe just a little bit of a surprise ending. The video store dude where it was out of stock said I was wasting my time... he was wrong.
1,Worse than I imagined it would be,"The first ten minutes or so of this movie that are set in the 18th century do manage to create some atmosphere. From there it all goes downhill. This movie is worse than I imagined it would be. The humor in it is for the most part dumb and the storyline is lame. For much of the movie it seems like the plot is centered around the rivalry between two fish canneries. Supposedly Tim Burton is a fan of the original show but it sure isn't evident in the way he parodies the characters. The writing is sloppy, one character out of nowhere is revealed in the last 10 minutes to have been a werewolf all along. It comes way out of left field and makes no sense. I found most of this movie boring and uninteresting. A good cast completely wasted."
3,for Johnny Depp fans only,"If you like his other 'weird' movies, you'll probably like this. It had it's moments. Don't now if I'll watch it again though...."
5,Enjoyed the Movie!,Great cast! Johnny Depp is sooo good! A different take on the actual TV series. I really enjoyed the movie. I watched it to the end!
1,Crap,"Crap, Depp has the range of Vince Vaughn… none at all. Don't waste ur time or $. What a joke."
2,Dark Shadows????,"Having been a fan of Dark Shadows for the past 45 years, I can honestly say that this is undoubtedly the best version of The Addams Family I have ever seen."
1,Movie: Dark Shadows,I watched this movie with my two grandsons (teens) and we were all really bored and forced to watch the whole movie in hopes it would get better. Didn't!!!!
2,dark shadow,I thought this movie was dumb. I didn't watch the original tv series or anything so i didn't know what to expect. I watched because i love Johny Depp. Maybe tv.series fans can appreciate the movie more than I.
2,Disapointing,"I was very disappointed in this movie. Unimpressive cast including Johnny Depp. It was like he was just walking through the part to just collect a pay check. Maybe I was just expecting too much based on my memories of the original series. Another issue I had was with the quality of download. It kept freezing up and going to a blank screen. I would have to start the movie from the beginning, running it forward and then having to reload again. Over all it was very annoying, a waste of money and a waste of time."
3,Cute campy movie,Cute campy movie. I used to love the Dark Shadows series when I was a kid. This didn't really live up to my expectations. But it had it's moments. I would recommend it to Tim Burton and Johnny Depp fans who are looking for something light and gothic. I would not recommend it to those who remember the Dark Shadows series fondly.
4,"Entertaining, Fun and Enjoyable","All around fun movie to watch. For those of us who remember the original TV series it brings back memories. For those in their teens who enjoy the current TV shows about Vampires, this is worth watching."
1,Waste of time,"This film has a great cast, fine locations and the sets are well done.1. This has NOTHING to do with the original TV series except in name. Just a tawdry attempt at attracting viewers.2. The writing is stale. There is nothing original nor funny. Did they spend all their budget on the cast?3. There is little to laugh at. Even Johnny couldn't save this travesty.4. There are more times the audience feels sorry for the actors than they do for the characters.5. Even a laugh track couldn't save this. And if they do add one, RUN!6. The true horror is the waste of one's time watching this mess. Such a lost opportunity and a waste of talent!"
2,The best parts were in the previews.,"This was not one of Tim Burton's best. Admittedly, I'm not a fan of recent revivals of old films and series that are basically comedic takes on the original subjects. A revived ""Dark Shadows"" could be a great series, or even a mini-series (heck, there was a good mini-series a few years back), but you simply can't squeeze anything of consequence from the hundreds of hours of the series into a sub-two-hour movie. Whole parts of the story line just don't make sense. Admittedly, there are a few well delivered lines that will make you chuckle (with Johnny Depp, how could you expect otherwise), but over all, as said in the header of the review, the best parts were in the previews. Stream it for a couple bucks if you're simply curious, but don't expect much. It won't be added to my collection."
3,Slow,The movie was slow. The chemistry between the actors just was not there. Overall I am very glad I rented the movie and did not buy it.
3,Letdown,"The best scenes in this movie were in the trailers, the movie itself was a letdown. I was very disappointed in it. The original series was admittedly campy but had a certain amount of intrigue. The movie was just lame."
3,A Bit Disappointed,I was expecting this to be a lot funnier and not quit so spooky . . . guess I should have known better since it's a Burton film.
3,"Ok, could have been better","This movie was ok, seemed a bit pedestrian for Burton. It may be that Burton may not have been as involved as he should have been or constrained by the license."
3,Dark Shadows,"Campy, cute movie made from old soap opera. Enjoyable to watch. Funny one-liners. Having grown up eatching the original I enjoyed watching the movie but wouldn't buy the DVD. Once was enough."
2,Very Predictable,"I had much higher expectations for this. I loved all actors in it, but the story was basically the same you've seen over and over. I was not amused. Actually fell asleep, woke up, and knew exactly what I missed."
4,Great movie,"This was a great movie. Glad we bought it, Johnny Depp was awesome as usual. I just recently got it and haven't had a chance to watch it more than just the one time, but we WILL watch it more than once."
1,Bought as a gift only,"I must admit, I only bought this as a Christmas gift for someone. I myself, after seeing the trailer for this movie, will never watch it! I was shocked at the way Johnny Depp treated this movie after he professed to have been a fan of the original. To turn it into a spoof was nothing short of insulting. I will continue to watch my DVD's of the original and the primetime series and leave this one alone."
2,Not my favorite Johnny Depp movie,"I like vampire movies. I like Johnny Depp. I'm old enough to have watched the original Dark Shadows daytime soap. Unfortunately, this movie was as stupid as the old soap. Depp was his typical character self.... but I have to say....just didn't like it."
3,Dark Shadows,"Cute movie, but not quite as good as I had expected from Johnny Depp. Good for a chuckel, but not a belly laugh."
3,Dark Shadows a fun romp for the most part,"We enjoyed the movie, but thought Johnny's makeup was a bit too much (too similar to Edward Scissorhands for us) and the parts between the truly funny bits was too draggy. Did like the homage to the original series."
3,"Not Good, Not Bad",Typical Johnny Depp if you are a fan it's O.K. if your not it's not worth ypur time to se it.
3,Dark shadows,"It was an okay movie. I love Johnny Depp but this movie was just not that good for me, but good enough to pass the time."
3,ok,I would say this movie was OK. not the greatest but i guess it was entertaining. I wouldn't brag that i seen it
3,Awesome cast,"I can't dislike a movie with a handful of my favorite actors. Costuming was gorgeous, the story was fun and Johnny Depp plays weird like only he knows how to do."
4,It was good,I liked this movie because not only was it silly funny but there was an actual story plot. Also how can you go wrong with Johnny Depp.
4,Enjoyable,"Enjoyable but disappointing, Johnny Depp is spending a lot of time in makeup in his latest films.Nice to see Michelle"
4,Dark Shadows,"Dark Shadows with Johnny Depp.Fun romp with the Dark Shadows clan. Especially enjoyed seeing members of the original cast in their cameo, entering the party as towns people."
3,meh,Johnny Depp is funn to watch in almost anything (except for what they did to Willy Wonka)... but this definitely has shades of Beetlejuice and is worth watching once if only for the fun references to the '70s.
3,Needs Editing,"Okay movie; now in blu ray library. If we watch again, we will skip a lot of over-extended, tedious scenes."
3,Ok,It wasnt as good as I thought it was going to be.. I actually didnt even sit through the whole movie so you know what that means
1,No sleep aid necessary,I was beyond bored. I actually fell asleep in this snoozer. I blame the script more than the actors. Too bad since I like Depp.
5,it's Johnny Depp,"Saw this movie in the theatre & liked it. I usually don't buy too many dvd's anymore but if it's got Johnny Depp in it, it's a winner hands down!"
1,Disappointing,"My mom knew Jonathan Frid, the original Barnabas, and he must be spinning in his grave at this travesty. I know it was a send-up, but the jokes are corny, and even Johnny Depp could not save this movie."
2,Boring...,"We really thought this movie would be funny, and were sadly disappointed. It drags on and on... And we barely laughed during the movie. Glad we just rented it because it would have been a waste of money if we bought it."
1,Worst movie!,"I am a huge fan of Johnny Depp and my mother has gotten me into watching some of the old episodes of Dark Shawdows, so we were both happy when this movie came out. We were very disapointed. The plot was horrible and confusing. The story was everywhere and the acting wasnt that great. I love every movie with Johnny, but I could almost not stand to even watch this. It was a train wreck from the start!! We almost walked out of the theater! Don't waste your time. It is nothing like the old shows and the plot really is bad!!"
1,Dark Shadows-Tim Burton Film,"Expected this to be funny, but really wasnt. Was soooooo dark that is was odd bc we were expecting humor. The witch did a very convincing job unlike Charlize Theron in Snow White and the Huntsman, other than that, the movie stunk. I kept expecting something, but it never happened. It was too dark to enjoy when you are expecting a comedy."
1,not good,I can't believe I paid to buy this movie. Should have rented at redbox and I still would have felt like I paid too much.
4,2012 Dark Shadows Movie,"I have to admit as a dyed-in-the-wool fan of the original series, I had misgivings about this 2012 update. First off, earlier this year, the trailer did nothing to make me want to buy--much less rent--this movie. But, I was bored to death yesterday and decided to give it a chance. And I'm glad I did--of the remakes I've seen of Dark Shadows, I enjoyed the movie immensely! Go into it with an open mind and a sense of humor: you might surprise yourself."
