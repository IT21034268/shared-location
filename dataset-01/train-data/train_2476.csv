2,What good are suction cups that don't SUCK!,"So I recieved this as a gift at my babyshower even though I didn't register for it and finally pulled it out to use it the other day now that my son is older and we're moved into the larger tub only to find out that it doesn't stick to the wall. At first I thought maybe it was my older son bumping it whenever he was taking a shower, but oh no that's not it at all. Then I thought maybe it was that I had something too heavy inside when really all I had were some rubber rings and I think maybe one tube of crayola draw on the walls crayon. But yet again, the darn thing came un-stuck. So basically the moral of this story is whenever you recieve something that you didn't register for, investigate whether or not it's not a piece of garbage before you open up the box and get past the point of no return. Literally."
1,Doesn't stay stuck,This product does not stay stuck to our bathtub walls. It is constantly falling and it's very frustrating. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
2,DOESN'T STICK TO TILE!,"Great idea, poor execution. The suction cups don't stick to our tile, and believe me, it's not some exotic tile. Therefore, the product is close to useless. As I'm writing this review, I'm shopping for a replacement product."
2,Suction cups need improvement,"The concept is better than the actual product... the cubby holds a lot but the suction cups don't hold well on tiled or smooth surfaces. The entire container has fallen into the tub unexpectedly, startling us. Not sure which was worse -- when it fell in during bathtime, scaring and splashing my infant daughter, or randomly after bathtime, leaving me to wonder whether there was an intruder in the house!"
4,NICE BUT NEED MORE THOUGHT,It is nice to have but needs some more thougth put in it...1. It is only for a corner tub so if you don't have a v in the wall and it is only like a u shape in the wall than this won't be a good one to get.Other than that it is great to have. 2. I love it that it stays open even if you put it out side the tub in a wall b/c you can still get in to it with out opening it and it stays open out side the tub in a corner even if it is not sticking to the wall. what a plus. 3. folds up nice to put up when not needed.well hope this does help out.they just don't have a pic of it yet but go to the store and they will have it there for you to see. It really is cute to see and really nice to have than the other ones.
4,A really good and interesting book.,As far as I remember I saw the film version of this book before I read it. I recommend that the book be read before watching the movie. This is a book I've read two times and it was definately worth the time. Unimaginable what it must've been like to be in his place. Survival was the driving force for Perel. Great book.
4,Amazing!!,"I saw the movie first, which got me interested in reading the book. Perel's story is amazing and his journey is inspirational. You hear so much about the other side of the story, the Jews who suffered under the Nazi forces. Now you hear about a Jew who joined them."
5,Excellent for me but maybe not you.,"Okay I know that this is the copy(nearly)of some other books but I didn't read those books.Anyway this book gives you an inside view of Stevie when the other books probobly didn't.And I really liked the letters,emails,plays and I liked reading the report too.If you have read those 2 other books and you don't like getting the inside view fine,don't get this book.If otherwise GET THIS BOOK!"
4,Great Book!,"I thought that Stevie: The Inside Story was a pretty good book. The plays, e-mails, and essays were pretty cool. I know that the problem with it is that it covers Saddle Club books #20-22.That's really what makes this book stink a little but I don't really care since I never actually read those books. In fact, the good thing is that it tells you what happens in those books if you never read them before. I highly recommend this book to someone who didn't read Saddle Club books #20-22 or don't really mind that it covers those books."
5,WoW! Nice Work!,Gerat Book! I couldn't stop laughing! Especially when Stevie's annoying brothers were typing all that funny stuff about her! I read it to my mum and even she even thought it was funny! A Must Read for any Half dead student or Headmistress!!!! It is a GREAT book!
5,Wow! Another fabulous saddle club book!,"I loved this book! I found Stevie's views very funny; and I loved getting more detail then what was in snow ride, racehorse, and foxhunt. (The books that Stevie is talking about.) Wonderful book! Worth buying!"
3,Stevie The Inside Story AVERAGE,i thought from hearing about this book for months that it was going to be great. some parts i liked some i didnt. i liked the book how it had emails and poems and plays but basically the book was a long and uncut versions of the other book which was a bit boring. i really liked in the book how you find out some more facts that werent in the other book eg.it ssaid what they thought was wrong with dina etc this book would be really good if you hadnt already read any of the others
1,What's the Point?,"I don't understand why Stevie the Inside Story was written. It was just a copy of some other Saddle Club books. The only difference between this book and the books it copies is that it's written through e-mails, letters, and a couple of plays. In my opinion I prefered reading the books seperately, not all jammed in one boring book. Some people may have liked Stevie the Inside Story but I think it was boring and pointless seeing as I already knew the ending to everything. Well that's my opinion, it may be totally different from yours."
2,this book is on the stupid side,on the whole i really like the saddle club. but this book is dumb to say the least. its just a rehash of books 20-22. on the whole they were just reprinted with the main points left in. but for those who want a complete saddle club series with no missing books you must buy it. otherwise save your money and reread the books.
1,It was boring,"I'll make this short. If you read the books this one was based on, well, you know what's going to happen, and it sucks all the anticipation of it. I'm sorry to say this, but I like not knowing the ending because then anything can happen. Knowing what's going to happen is seriously boring and sucky."
4,"Basic, but nice.","This yogurt maker works great, but has absolutely no frills. I've used it several times, and each time my yogurt comes out mild and creamy. I like the plastic tub, which holds a generous but managable quantity of yogurt (enough to last several days, but not so much that it spoils before I can eat it) and easily goes from the maker to the fridge. The yogurt maker itself is compact and fits easily on my pretty crowded countertop, while the single, large tub makes it easy to pour the milk directly from the saucepan; much better than messing around with small individual jars. I find that it is no problem simply to pack up my yogurt in Rubbermaid or old plastic yogurt cups if I want to bring it with me, and a small tradeoff given the price difference between this model and fancier ones with individual jars. My only complaint is that I wish that it came with a timer."
3,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!,BEWARE -- I bought this yogurt maker 3 years ago for $12.00 (including tax)!!!I love this yogurt maker but not for $199.00!!!
4,Nice little appliance,"Very nice inexpensive yogurt maker.. The only problem I had at first was that the yogurt wasn't thick enough but I found that if I leave it on for about 6 hours it is good. I also put the cooled yogurt in a coffee filter to strain out more of the liquid.. This makes it much better when adding berries and such, It stays thick."
4,Easy yogurt making for the novice......,"This is the first time I tried my hands at making yogurt and that too I by chance came across this product. Twice i made yogurt using the Salton yogurt maker and it turned out just great..Just follow the instructions in the manual and its easy and taste great. I would say its at par with Danon's if not better. My son just loves yougurt mixed with fruits, smoothies. Also, i use it for marinating meats and whenever I want its ready in few hours."
4,Easy as can be,"Like others, I bought mine here at Amazon. I got it on sale for $15.00 or less, can't remember. Nearly $200? I can't imagine why, unless they include somebody to heat the milk for you.Face it, there's some work with making yogurt no matter what you do. Heating and cooling the milk is b o r i n g but with this gizmo that's about all you have to do. No making fussy little boxes to ""cook"" it in, no wondering if the oven is too hot/cold if you cook it in there. Couldn't be easier, makes a lovely product. Follow the directions included, and make sure you have a thermometer! I use a meat thermometer, works fine."
4,Great guilt free sweets,This is a great idea for those hot summer months coming up. Instead of ice cream this little guy will make delicious sweets for the whole family. I just love mine and would encourage everyone to get one!
1,it does nothing extra.,"I don't like to fail so may be that's why I am challenging myself to make yogurt. I thought this will do the magic, you have to do everything manually before you put the mixture in this machine, how on earth I am going to bring the milk to 100f? put your finger and count to 10 didn't work, how would I know the starter still working. all this machine does is keep it warm, it does not tell when it is ready, doesn't have a thermostat, the cover does not close well, the price is cheap but why buy that if you have to do all the guessing work and then just keep it warm which you can do naturally on a hot day or after you use your oven or with thick covering to the mix, I just think it is a stupid machine, does nothing...."
3,"it is fine sometimes, not as expected sometimes.","Hi,I used it for few number of times, it is taking nearly 12 hours for yogurt to be formed, and sometimes it is sooo liquidish even after 12 hrs. Anyways all over this is fine."
1,I don't understand all the positive reviews on this?,"I tried making the yogurt a couple of times according to the directions in the booklet it came with plus all the advice from the reviews. All I got was a watery cottage cheese like goop, Yuk! I am returning it and buying my yogurt in the store the way I always have!"
2,Makes a great coin jar,"To be fair, I haven't used this product since I purchased it a month ago. I bought it thinking I'd save money. I can't find a box of dry milk under $12, which you need in order to make yogurt. A large container of yogurt is $3.99, sometimes less with coupons. To bad I threw out the box, maybe could have returned it. Instead of saving money, I've lost shelf space."
3,Not happy,I just received my yogurt maker. I don't know how I like it yet because it didn't come with a recipi book. I am not happy about this because now I have to find some before I can make yogurt. I didn't expect a lot but I would like to know how much vanilla and sugar to put in a quart.
1,my review,it is nothing but a container. I returned it immediately after the first use. don't waste your money.
5,salton 1 quart yogurt maker,"I like the size of the unit and the container, I had a salton yogurt maker that did individual cup for 15 years I hope this one last as long."
1,"Yogurt maker? Yogurt incubator, maybe","I thought this would be like a breadmaking machine--that you would put in the ingredients, turn the machine on and come back to a finished product. Well, no. This is a yogurt maker in the same way that your _oven_ is a breadmaker--you have to cook the ingredients to a certain temperature, cool them to a certain temperature, and then this thing apparently (arguably, judging by some reviews) keeps it at a steady temperature as it reaches its final stages. It may or may not be useful as a helper in this final step (some people just use their oven; others find it doesn't have a low enough setting). However, the initial steps were too much work for me. It doesn't cost much, but it doesn't do much either."
5,Why such a high price?,I originally bought the Salton YM9 yogurt maker in 2001. My real rpoblem now is that I paid $[...] for it then. Now it has stopped working. I was going to buy another expecting the price to be slightly higher but what I have been finding is that the price has shot throught the roof. The cheapest I can find now is for $[...] plus shipping. Nice yogurt maker but my fondness for it has gone to zero. Salton can find another sucker for it.
1,This product contains BPA - find a different yogurtmaker!,"I bought this yogurt maker 2 1/2 years ago and used it regularly. However, when the recent BPA scare came out, I contacted the company to ask if it contains BPA. At first they did not respond to me at all. When I tried again, they sent me a ridiculous boilerplate message about how the US gov't does not see BPA as being dangerous. I would strongly recommend using a non-plastic yogurt maker (or at least one that doesn't contain BPA, as the chemical especially leaches into food when heated, and the whole point of a yogurt maker is to incubate the yogurt at the proper temperature) rather than risking exposing your family to more of this chemical than they have already gotten. It's upsetting to think I was doing something healthy for my sons by making them homemade yogurt instead of the storebought find, only to learn that they were exposed to extra bpa because of this maker. I am using the glass jar method now."
5,"Great yogurt, no fuss","I just took my first bite of yogurt made in my Salton yogurt maker and I had to write. Sweetened with a package of Splenda, my yogurt is tangy and refreshing, with a fresh taste that I haven't found in supermarket products. I had been nervous that maybe I wouldn't like the homemade yogurt as well, but it is a taste revelation.I took the good advice of tossing out the plastic container that came with the yogurt maker, using instead a big ole pickle jar that fit nicely. I sterilized it in boiling water for a few minutes and filled it with some leftover 2% and skim milk and put the jar in the microwave. I really liked that I could carry out the entire procedure all in a single container. For my starter I used the Greek style yogurt that you can get at Whole Foods and some supermarkets.I left the yogurt to incubate overnight, maybe 11 hours and now I have fantastic yogurt!"
4,Large batch yogurt maker,"The Salton yogurt maker is ideal for making larger batches of yogurt. It is very reliable. The only drawback I have found is that the plastic container/insert seems to get brittle after a few uses. Otherwise, I think it's a wonderful tool to have in the kitchen."
3,Still trying for good yogurt,"After several batches, I haven't yet perfected my yogurt-making process. I bought this unit after reading reviews that suggested it was a piece of cake, slam dunk, etc. to make terrific yogurt. So far I'm underwhelmed... most batches are too watery. As far as the unit goes, it keeps it's temperature so I guess that's all you need and all you can ask ot it. I'll keep trying."
5,'P'erfect yogurt !!......,You cannot imagin how happy I am with the product. Getting a perfect yogurt is like a piece of cake with Salton. If you love to eat GO.....ood yogurt Pls...pls.............. buy it and you will never regret it.
4,For the yogurt lover,"this is a perfect, inexpensive machine that facilitatesa simple and natural process. you fill the container withscalded or UHT milk, add a yogurt starter, plug in the machineand wait. you'll get usable yogurt after about eight hours,but it continues to develop for periods as long asthirty-six.you can use one-quart commercial yogurt containers aswell as the liner supplied with the unit, so you don'thave to wait to consume a batch before starting another.you should be aware that UHT milk doesn't need to bescalded and that makes yogurt-making extra convenient.it's also a good idea to infuse milk with flavors andthen drain the resultant yougurt to make yogurt cheese.herbal, savory and sweet variations are all easy tomake and act as great substitutes for mayonnaise orsour cream.--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE andthe forthcoming novel bang BANG from Kunati Books. ISBN 9781601640005"
2,I can't believe the price,"I have one of these yogurt makers. I bought the unit new about 4 years ago. The cost was $12.99. Are they really selling these for over $200? I was going to purchase another one, but at this rediculous price I will continue using the one I have until it breaks. Yogurt can be made using a crockpot if it has a warm setting. Put some water in the crocpot and then put in your container of milk and culture and let sit for 8 hours. It is certainly much cheaper than what they are charging for this unit."
5,Successful everytime,"I bought this yogurt maker to replace a very old 2 quart unit. Didn't want the little containers, just wanted one large for easy storage and cleaning. This maker has a great compact design with little grabbers and indentations where needed for lifting and inserting the internal 1 quart container into the housing. A spoon is included to hold down the internal cover. Yogurt consistency comes out perfect every time. Started with the Cuisipro Donvier yogurt starter for the initial batch. Then, saved some yogurt from this batch to start new batch and continue on this way for each new batch. Control the tartness by adjusting how long you incubate the yogurt."
1,A few months ago this was $17,What's up with the price?? I was literally $17 and change a few months ago...has there been a run on yogurt makers??? Definitely won't buy from amazon...
4,Salton YM9 1-Quart Yogurt Maker,great little machine.we now have 2 of them.the only thing that couldbe improved is the top.Drop it and you will be taping itup like I did. brittle pastic.Still works good with tape on it.
4,Great for the price. Four and a half stars.,Basic yogurt maker. Great value. We're getting a lot of use out of it and have probably made enough yogurt in the first few weeks to more than cover cover it's cost. I hope the plastic construction holds up over time.Most of all I would very much like to see a two quart (or larger) version as we often prepare food for groups of 20+ people.
5,excellent,"Makes perfect yogurt everytime. I use my own glass jar instead of the plastic one that came with it.The yogurt is perfect consistency , I use boiled raw skimmed milk and the results are much better as compared to pastuerised milk. Before using this yougurt maker I had tried everything, a sweater , a jacket around the milk in a jar , in the oven and slow cooker to create the right temprature, but nothing worked . This is a perfect simple little device.Once you know your timings,you will find it very easy to use.I will never go back to commercial yougurts sitting in plastic containers,God knows for how long!"
4,Quite good - not perfect,"My main beef here is that the actual container is made out of plastic, rather than glass, or a ceramic. We have enough chemical poisons around as it is and don't need them especially here, when making a healthful food such as yogurt, or kefir.Otherwise, it works fine, as described."
4,Good one!,It helps to keep the temperature constant. If it was not plastic I would have given it 5 stars. Money well spent!
4,Good Yogurt,It works great and you don't have to fill all those little cups. I honestly wish it was twice the size. Good value for my nickel though.
4,Yogurt Made Easy,"This is really simple to use and the yogurt is great tasting. Having lived in Germany for the past 15 years, I was spoiled by fantastic tasting yogurt from plain to exotic flavors. With this yogurt maker, I can make plain yogurt just as well as anything I could buy in Germany.The only complaint is that you only have one container and it doesn't seem that Salton sells these as replacement parts. Having a second container would make things a bit easier. The price is right and maybe I will just buy another maker.If you like thicker yogurt or creamier yogurt use a bit more non-fat dried milk powder. A candy thermometer makes things much easier, too!"
5,Amazing little yogurt maker,"Well I just got done checking in on my first batch of yogurt from my new Salton yogurt maker, I must say I was soooooooooo excited as it is a perfect consistancy and great tasting yogurt!!!This is so neat, I personally do NOT mind the plastic container and the spoon is a nice stir spoon when you fold the yogurt starter into the warm milk so I don't realize what all the complaining is about!! I like the way the cord wraps up all neat and it is also NOT a problem and it even has a little hole so the machine is not sitting on the cord!! It is a well thought up simplistic design without all the electronics that sometimes break down. If you can't figure out this little no brainer, I truely feel sorry for you!!!Way to go SALTON!!!!"
1,Is this made of gold? silver?,"I was planning on getting this, but the price is way way too much. $199?? $500??? Retail value for this item is $27. There are other yogurt makers much cheaper. This item has been discontinued. Usually when a small kitchen appliance is discontinued it goes on clearance. It is important to note that this item does not churn ice cream, and it does not churn or freeze yogurt. This item merely heats to the proper temperature for making yogurt. The sellers who are selling this item are clearly unethical as anyone can see by the price. This is a yogurt maker and should be priced as such. Someone needs to get real and fix the price issue here. Amazon should not allow this sort of price gouging."
1,$138?!? Seriously?,"I was about to buy this Salton yogurt maker because I looked at it the other day and thought, ""Huh, $25 is pretty reasonable to me even if other people think that's still too expensive."" So I come back to this link and it's now $138? What the heck, Amazon? Needless to say, I'll be incubating my yogurt in the oven as usual tonight. Geez!"
5,Easy as Pie...errr...Yogurt to Use!,"This Salton YM9-1 Qt Yogurt maker is very easy to use and clean. The directions for use are very clear and the ability to make yogurt in a quart container instead of all the little cups is so convenient. The yogurt can be made using a culture or actual yogurt, one way is as easy as the other. It has a dial on top that adjusts between the numbers 1 to 12. I use it to tell me what time my yogurt will be ready. It could also be used to indicate how long you want to 'cook' your yogurt. The ease of use is the same if making yougurt with skim milk or full cream...ummm...when made with cream, it's called creme bulgare, try it. it's decadent! I'm very happy with my Salton 1 quart yogurt maker."
2,fairly complicated to use,I thought I could try to learn making yogurt after buying this product. However it looks I will need thermometer or other tools as well.
3,I loved the idea,"Unfortunately, my desire for home made yogurt exceeded my ability to make yogurt that I actually wanted to eat.I tried a few times and was unable to get a mixture I really liked, or even improve upon. For me the consistency, time and effort far exceeded what it would take to just buy non-fat greek yogurt from Trader Joes."
1,Price misprint,This yogurt maker used to sell for under $20. Is the price quoted now a misprint?Salton YM9 1-Quart Yogurt Maker
1,buyer be...informed,"Three things you should know about this product that might not be obvious if you don't know which questions to ask:1. The machine is not very large. It will make 4 cups of yogurt at a time.2. The ""measuring"" spoon is more decorative than functional. It is shaped like a scraper, not a spoon, and it's not a very good scraper.3. This machine does NOT come with a thermometer! You will need to buy a candy or deep fryer thermometer that registers as low as 100 degrees."
4,Good deal and good eats.,I bought and have used it many times now and it makes fantastic yogurt with no aditives and from milk I trust. A hint buy wide mouth quart mason brand jars and use them and throw out the plastic tub. The jar has lids and can be used to heat the milk and make the yogurt and store it. A much better solution in my opinion and it works great for making more when you have only a little left. I have been totally pleased and am sorry I didn't do it before. Oh the four stars come from the plastic tub and no mention of the jars in the manual that would make it a six star unit.
2,Not very useful,This thing does not have timer so if you forget to switch if off in time you'll have a very sour yogurt
4,"Great Product, Slight Catch","You know how people always say that you only use a breadmaker for a year? Well, they do.This yogurt maker is kind of like a breadmaker, except you won't get a full year's use out of it. If you are sincerely devoted to creating rich, delicious yogurt then this the product for you. But for everyone else: THINK BEFORE YOU BUY.If there's a household appliances addiction recovery program, Amazon should be lawfully obliged to post a hyperlink to it on this page."
3,$14.99 is the lowest price so far,I know old Jewish guys are still making yogurt from hundred year old starter just by pouring milk over a spoonful of starter but I have not been able to do that. I will keep trying but in the meantime I have refused to buy yogurt and I need affordable yogurt for curries.
3,"Easy enough to use, but it's easier to just buy your yogurt.","This is a very simple yogurt maker, but then again, it's a yogurt maker, they're not that complicated. It yields good consistency yogurt, and if you really, REALLY like yogurt, you should buy it.However, this yogurt maker requires a bit of yogurt to ""start"" the yogurt in it. This means that you probably have to buy yogurt anyway. If you want a lot of varieties of yogurt, I recommend just purchasing plain yogurt and adding the fruit or flavor you like. It is cheaper and less hassle.Overall, this yogurt maker doesn't [stink], but I can't picture myself using it at all in the future. But hey, it does look kind of important on my counter :)"
1,What is the dial on the lid for?,"1.) I just got my Yogurt maker in the mail from Amazon.com and the direction book isn't very good. What is the dial for on the lid? It goes from 1 to 10. What purpose does it serve?2.) The manual doesn't tell you what temperature ""near boiling"" is. Thanks to the folks in this bulletin board who said to heat the milk to 185-190 degrees.3.) The manual says to cool the milk to 100-110 degrees; yet people on this bulletin board are saying 110-115. Hum... I'm confused. I've never made yogurt before."
3,The reviews were very helpful,"I wonder if the price has gone down, as they're now getting the timer better, the lid fitting better, the spatula better, and the recipes more helpful. I think I'll wait to see if they improve what sounds like a really good product that could be better."
1,Buyer Beware of Excess Shipping Costs,For the $2.95 yogurt starter Amazon charges $4.98 for shipping. What a ripoff.Dr. Tom
3,You need Yogurt to Make Yogurt?,"Ok, maybe its just me but I didnt think you would need to buy yogurt to make yogurt. And then I thought that I could make all these great flavored yogurts that would be so great, but you arent supposed to add flavors until the machine is done making the yogurt. So, while it is still great to make your own yogurt, its not quite as gourmet as I thought."
1,Not worth it,"It is just like a slow cooker and it is so small. I had been using a slow cooker to make yogurt by myself and then I thought that I could get a yogurt maker to save my trouble. But after I got it, ----I found it is just another smaller slow cooker!!You have to go through all the same steps: warm your milk in a clean container; --- put it into the slow cooker or the so-called yogurt maker; put the yogurt seed that you bought ; --- make sure the temperature not too high to kill the yogurt bacteria; ---watch the time to make sure you are not ""overgrow "" it; --- take it out.There was at least twice that I thought I needed not to watch the time--because, it is a yogurt maker and it should stop by itself, but it did not. And then my yogurt turned into something hard to describe--sticky and very sour.Now this ""Yogurt maker"" is not used anymore at my home."
1,Heats the milk much to hot...,"I tried using this to make yogurt on 3 different occations and each time, I ended up with curdled glop. So, to check the temperature it was heating my milk to, I plugged it in and filled it with water. Yogurt is incubated at around 110 degrees. This contraption heated the water to a astounding 185 degrees. I am returning it and going back to making yogurt using my oven and a light bulb."
5,Works great,"I bought the maker for making my own low carb yogurt. I have found it works great with the new Carb Countdown milk, as well as with goat's milk for the kids. I would like to buy a glass mason jar with a tight lid for the container though, but so far the plastic one included has worked fine.I have only had 1 batch of yogurt turn out bad, but I think that was more my fault for quick cooling the milk and doing a few other things differently. I love being able to make my own yogurt at home. Not only does it save me money, I belive having the choice of my own sweetners and avoideing addatives and preservatives is good for the health of the whole family."
2,"You get what you pay for it, i.e. not a great yogurt maker.","A single quart is a good size IMHO, better than the more expensive multi-jar competition. However ... this thing gets way too hot. I ran a number of tests and found the temperatures rose to well over 130F after several hours. It made reasonable yogurt, but not great yogurt, because it got too hot too fast. Worse, for me anyhow, was that the excessive temperature killed the culture making it impossible to use one batch to seed the next. Starting with a fresh culture worked OK, but that's an extra expense. I've quit using it and bought a different though pricier unit with better temperature control."
3,What you pay is what you get,"This is exactly what you can expect for this price. It works well, like every other method to make yoghurt. It is nice and small(not much storage space) but since it has no timer you really have to watch when you turn it on. Because when you want to leave the house and you have nobody to turn it off, after a certain time the yoghurt becomes a little to tart. So, if you serious about yoghurt making, invest a little more."
3,Trouble with plastic insert,"This is a great yogurt maker, very easy to use, but for reasons known only to Salton, they made the container insert from cheap plastic, not glass. Given the overwhelming recent research and evidence of the dangers of ""cooking"" with plastic, it is inconceivable to me that they did not use glass, or at least a heavier, higher quality plastic that would not ""leak"" into the food. Had I known about the plastic inner container, I would not have bought this product. I'm looking for a glass jar, beaker, or other container to use in its place, but it's an odd size. Very frustrating."
5,Price rip-off,"On Feb. 19th, 2009 I purchased this item for $26. Now, it's selling for $140?!?!? What gives? This is a good yogurt maker, but it's not 'golden'."
2,It's a Thermos,"I got one on Freecycle, thinking it would make my yoghurt making easier. Turns out it's nothing more than an electric thermos. I've been making yoghurt as others described below, but using my large Thermos and making a half gallon at a time. The only thing I do differently is wash it out with boiling water beforehand to clean it and heat it up. Saves the electricity for the exact same outcome. No need to buy another appliance to make yoghurt."
4,Salton yogurt Maker,"This yogurt maker makes great yogurt and is very easy to use, but the design of the yogurt container could be improved as it doesn't really close."
5,Better than expected,Followed instructions and made the best yogurt I've eaten. Used a Greek yogurt starter with a 1% plus milk. Delicious.
4,Salton Yogurt Maker,It works well and it's easy to store and clean. I just wish it had a timer for automatic shut off. The instuction manual is not that detailed either but this product can't be found in other brands like Cuisinart which I am very loyal to. I only used it once since I bought it but it had great results. The recipe for basic plain yogurt calls for an unnecessary ingrediant - dry milk. I didn't use it and I used less yogurt culture (just a third of what was recommended) yet the result was perfect.
5,works great!,"I love it. I like to buy imported Greek yogurt, and use that as the starter. The yogurt I make is creamy and wonderful. Very thick, and mild. I love to put frozen mixed berries in a tupperware, and add some of this yogurt and a sprinkling of splenda. By lunchtime the berries are thawed and the yogurt is still cold, to me it's like cheesecake! I also use this yogurt in the place of sour cream, and I make a great Tzatziki by adding a little olive oil and some grated cucumber. I have used it a lot and just love it."
5,Not necessary but really nice to have.,"While you don't need this to make great yogurt it certainly helps to keep things neat and clean. I've had mine for 5-6 months now, used it every few weeks and have had no problems of any kind.More than worth the inexpensive price."
5,Homemade yogurt tastes so much better than storebought,I bought this yogurt maker shortly after hearing a report on a morning TV show saying that the additive carmine in many strawberry yogurts is actually ground up little red bugs - for color. Yuck! Not what I want my kids eating...and they love yogurt. This maker is incredibly easy to use and makes a delicious yogurt. You can control the additives and the fat content. I think it's great!
4,Salton YM9 1-quart Yogurt Maker,"It's great! I've one myself and been praised about the yogurt it makes for a very long time. This time, I bought two units for my sisters and they love it too."
2,"OK machine, but not what I expected.","I bought two of this item because people said that a 1 quart Mason jar fit inside it perfectly. Unfortunately, since those reviews were written, the design must have changed because quart sized mason jars do not fit the yogurt makers that were delivered to me. The glass jars are too narrow and too tall to work well with it. Now, unless I can find a short fat quart jar, I am stuck with the plastic liner that came with the set. Very disappointed. :("
5,Everyone should own one,"This is a great little gadget, within hours of it arriving we had lovely fresh organic yogurt to eat. Its easy to clean, easy to use - perfect. Once you have made your own you will never go back to that awful stuff from the store!!"
1,price v quality,"i bought the salton ym9 yogurt maker over a year ago from amazon for about 12.99, as i recall. amazon is currently (6/29/08)listing it at $189.99. It is a spectacular buy at $12.99. It is a joke or a serious error at $189.99."
4,Worked Very Well Made Extremly Small Amounts of Yogurt but tasty.,Item was smaller than expected but works and Came timely and worked appropriately and delivery time was good and was packaged well. I sent my mother one.
3,Runny yogurt,"The Salton yogurt maker is an interesting gadget but I think it can not possibly produce high quality yogurt. Although I followed the directions completely, the yogurt turned out runny. Also, there are no recipes included which means you are under your own devices to produce a good tasting yogurt."
5,"more money for you, less waste for the landfill","I am really!! pleased with my yogurt maker.Keep in mind that your yogurt will be runnier than brand name yogurts because you will be making it all fresh with no thickening additives (like aguar gum or carrageen). If you use especially juicy fresh or frozen fruit you will wind up with ""drinkable"" yogurt. My 2 year old loves it when I take the drinkable yogurt and freeze it in mugs (cover mug with plastic wrap) and make ""frozen yogurt"". It's a great way to get extra calcium into milk reluctant kids.But most of all, I love the fact that I'm not sending a little plastic cup into the landfill every time I eat 3 spoonfuls of yogurt.And I really love the great price I got at Amazon."
5,wonderful little machine!!!,"I had a 6 (separate) cup yogurt maker which was difficult to keep clean. The yogurt maker made by Salton is very easy to use and makes perfect yogurt every time! Just follow the instructions and you have nice, wholesome, yogurt with no additives and at a fraction of the cost too. Truly, it is one of the best gadgets I own."
4,yogurt maker,"I've never owned a yogurt maker before so I don't have too much to compare it to, but I really do like it. Making yogurt is really easy and being the novice that I am, it still turns out perfect everytime. I also drain it using cheesecloth to make a thicker ""Greek style"" yougurt and can substitute this for sour cream. I would recommend this to anyone interested in making their own yogurt."
5,"Homemade yogurt, here I come!","I've only made two batches of yogurt so far, but I'm very happy with this little yogurt maker. It is a nice compact design that stores well (and looks like a little R2-D2 sitting on your countertop). I like that it makes just one container of yogurt instead of a bunch of little cups like other machines. The directions are very basic and brief, which is fine, but I got several books from the library to understand the yogurt-making process a little better. Now, if I only had a goat...."
1,shop around,"If you pay more than $28 for this machine, you are being ripped off ROYALLY. The price range for this should be between $16 and $27, max. If you can't find this yogurt maker from an online supplier in that price range, buy another brand. The prices quoted on Amazon are an outrage. Don't bite."
5,Highly recommended for those who buy yogurt regularly,"I bought this model a few weeks ago and have made four batches. Works really well, easy to use and clean. Check the label on your favorite brand of commercially produced yogurt and see all of the ingredients your won't be eating when you make your own. Nice."
3,A little hard to figure out at first,"I've had mine about three weeks now, and am just now getting the hang of it. Made two batches of goop on my first attempt. But it's working fine now, maybe a little more effort then I would like to put into yogurt. But I have made some very tasty yogurt! If you're looking to experiment and try a few things you will be happy with this machine. Other wise stick to buying yogurt at the grocery store."
3,You will need to experiment!,"This is a great product especially in winter when yogurt does not form easily. I found that you have to experiment with the times and concentrations for some time before you get the correct ones. If you keep it on too long, the yogurt curdles too much. If you follow instructions exactly and follow it everytime then it is easier to get good and well formed yogurt."
5,Yogurt maker,"You can't beat the value! This inexpensive yogurt maker works GREAT, and is SO EASY to use! No need for fancy books with recipies/etc...the basic instructions tell you how to make a basic batch of yogurt. After that, add whatever you desire (after the yogurt is cultured) and you are done! It does take approx. 10 hours to make a batch though (as will all other machines I imagine), so be prepared for that. Otherwise, no need to spend extra $$ on fancy machines, this ones works great! All you need otherwise is some individual serving containers to spoon your yogurt into, and you are done.... and cleanup is a BREEZE!"
5,So Simple-So Great,The directions to making yogurt are so easy...even for an old bachelor. The end result was some of the best yogurt I've had in years. If your tired of all the fancy store brands...try the Salton Yogurt machine.....it's great.
5,The Best Yogurt Ever!,"We love this little machine. One of our favorite aspects is that it is just the right size to hold a quart canning jar for making yogurt. We prefer making the yogurt in glass containers, though the plastic container that comes with the machine also works fine. We learned through another Amazon review that a quart canning jar (with the ring and lid lighty secured during processing) would work fine. This is what really sold us on the selection of this particular machine. Making the yogurt is easy, and the result is creamy and non-bitter. In six hours, the yogurt was perfect. (It helps to cover the machine with a dish towel to keep the warmth even while in use.) It literally is the best yogurt that we have ever eaten. Our focus lately has been to reduce our purchase of non-recyclable, petroleum-manufactured products like plastics, and the use of this perfect little yogurt maker has been one more small step along the way with high-quality results!"
3,Optimum temperature?,"I bought this yogurt maker with the expectation that it would maintain the correct temperature for making yogurt. It seems to me that I read that the optimum temperature for making yogurt is between 100F and 110F. Unfortunately, my digital cooking thermometer was registering 128F after a few hours. The outside of the box for this product states that it is thermostatically controlled. I opened the yogurt maker with screwdriver and it does not contain a thermostat, just a couple of heating wires. I solved the problem by plugging the yogurt maker into an external dimmer switch that I bought from a home improvement store and reducing the power to about 75%. This method works, however, I'm disappointed that I had to go to this measure to correct the temperature."
2,alright if you can use it very attentively,"1. Operates by plugging in (no switch available).2. No time setting adjustments. I wish i could set the number of hours i would like the thing to be on. This has been my biggest problem because if i leave this on longer than needed the yogurt easily becomes tart.3. the milk needs to be boiled, cooled and then put into the yogurt maker. I guess that is how most of them are."
4,Basic Yogurt Maker,"I tried it yesterday and was able to get my home-made yogurt. I am very excited!This item is a basic yogurt maker in that it just serves as a container and a warmer. It helps the bacteria to turn milk into yogurt by keeping the container at a constant temperature.The timing dial on the cover seems like decoration only without any real function, and that's why I am giving it four stars (hoping the new model would come out with a timer somehow).Other than that, this yogurt maker is good and worth the penny I spent for it. Would recommend it to friends!"
4,Good reliability,This is the only Yogurt maker that I bought. I have been using this for some years now and product works just great.
1,These are NOT non-lead crystal. They contain 5% LEAD OXIDE!,"Contrary to what the description says about these glasses being lead-free, these glasses contain 5% LEAD OXIDE by weight, as stated on a sticker attached to each glass. Back they go. Luckily Amazon has an easy return policy. Just please be more accurate with your descriptions. I do not need to have me or kids drinking out of glasses containing lead oxides."
2,I wish I'd paid more attention to the dimensions,"Just when I thought I was getting used to everything being so much bigger in the US... I should have taken more notice of the other reviews. Beautiful glasses but they are way too small. My set will also be returned, they are a really odd size somewhere in between any use I would have for them."
3,"""GRANDE"" = NOT-SO-GRANDE","The glasses arrived today in a large box, which I opened and was shocked to see another smaller box inside..... The glasses are disappointingly small. The quality appears to be good, and the design is appealing. If these glasses were just a little bigger (say 13-16 ounces) I'd rate them at 5 stars. I'm only keeping them because of the other glasses I ordered as a package deal that got me a GREAT price........"
3,Great Series -,"I have been watching this series by taking advantage of free Prime Streaming and really do love Geraldine McEwan in the portrayal of Miss Marple.If you are considering buying this ""complete collection,"" I strongly suggest you price around, since there are multiple sellers here on Amazon, and this particular grouping seems to run a lot higher for the three seasons than you can buy elsewhere here online.I love the series, but prefer the lower prices of other venders. :-)"
3,Great series but not to be confused with Dame Agatha Christie's books,"It pains me to write this review as I think Geraldine McEwan's portrayal of Miss Marple is charming. She captures the mischievousness I have always thought was a brilliant undertone in the books.Howver, as an adaptation, there was just too MUCH adapting... I think any of Dame Christie's books could be screenplays in themselves and much prefer her storylines than the ones in these shows.I also was a bit put off in that 2 of the shows were not even orginally Miss Marple books; Sittaford House was GREATLY altered and I thought lost a lot of its charm.As individual movies they are nice, but as Miss Marple adapations? I think not!"
1,Agatha Christie's Marple: Geraldine McEwan Collection,"And yet again, Acorn releases another collection without Subtitles for the Hearing Impaired. Come on people, this is 2012, and all disabilities should be accommodated by this time. There is simply no excuse for this oversight. And what is the most aggravating, is that the UK versions all have subtitles, what is up with that?? Blatant discrimination in my view. Acorn WAKE UP!"
4,minimum cocktail requirement,They work well for modern serving sizes and aren't overly delicate.Remember to chill before use.
3,Beautiful glasses...why wouldn't they wrap them better,"The other reviewers are too kind...what good are beautiful glasses if only 3 of 6 arrive unbroken...I just don't get it, why wouldn't they wrap them better. They are put in a box with dividers, with no more than one thin piece of wrapping paper around each one. I bought these as a wedding present for a friend...some gift, how embassasing to give him 3 martini glasses because the rest had been broken..."
4,"Look Great, But Poor Packing Results In Breakage",Beautiful glassware! Too bad they are packed so poorly. It's surprising only one was shattered. Now the hassle of trying to get a replacement for one of six without returning the whole order...
3,"Fine Glassware, but expect shipping damage","The glasses are great, but beware, they are extremely fragile. When I received my glasses, 2 of the six were shattered in the box. Amazon customer service was great and sent a replacement set promptly. When the replacement set arrived, found two of that set broken also. So I carefully packed up two good glasses and four glasses worth of shattered glass and returned it. My guess is that Amazon returns opened a package of six sets of shattered glass."
4,Also broken,"The glasses are nice quality, but like the majority of other people who ordered these they arrived broken because of insufficient packing material.You would think someone at amazon would fix the problem instead of shipping these over and over again."
3,Can't register very cold temps,"I like this thermometer, but the outside probe maxes out at -21.8F. If you live in a very cold climate, get the newer model which goes down to -39.8F. I especially want to know what the temperature is when we hit the extremes. When everything's 70F and sunny, who looks at the thermometer!?"
2,"This one works, last one didn't","I had a LaCrosse set of sensors and thermometers and one of the readouts kept giving me fits by losing signal. Unfortunately I didn't take the time to contact the company while it was still fairly new and I had all the packaging and such. So I bought this WS-7034U to replace the one that was acting up, and so far the new one has been working.So while I now have a working setup, if I could do it all over again I would avoid LaCrosse products at all and go with one of their competitors, I really shouldn't have had to replace one of the components."
2,Not bad...,"It is not a bad little unit. However, it is inconsistant with the sensors. You could put one in the fridge & one next to a heater & ch 1 would be 40 & the other 80...then after a while, ch 1 would be 75 & the other 52. Not impressed."
5,LaCrosse WS-7034U,"This is a replacement for a like unit that functioned very well for five years. I expect the same performance from this one. I will take care to protect it from direct rain, as per the direction sheet. The directions for the first unit I had did not indicate to do this."
1,Great only for 1yr,I purchased this on sale for $12.00 and it worked great for 1yr. Then the outdoor temp no longer worked. Replacing the batteries or the outdoor sensor did not fix the problem.
4,Excellent book but outdated,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I'm going to be a cop next year and thought this book was helpful. BUT, it seriously seriously needs to be updated. A LOT of the things in this book may have been relevant in 1985 when it was orignally published but i feel things have changed dramatically since then. It was 16 years ago! I would LOVE for the author to go out again and do what he did for this book and create a 2000 version! I would definitely be interested in that. On the whole, it's great."
2,Hollywood Production,"I was really disapointed in this one and had to stop whatching it half way through. IF your serious about history, which I am, this isn't it for you. It's basically a colorized Hollywood production. Although, If you like seeing the old stars of Hollywood in those days you might enjoy it."
1,Worst Phone I Have Ever Used,"I have had this phone for over a month now. For some reason, when you press a number button ""0-9"", it does not always register with the phone. The phone beeps, but if you listen into the handset, it never transmits the tone over the phone line. So when a phone number has a ""2"" in it for example, you have to press the ""2"" button one to five times before it will actually register. This also affects memory dial and causes that feature to be completely useless."
3,Its ok,The only problem with this product is that the handset turns off sometimes on its own when its fully charged already and I have to plug in charger so it turns back on.
1,Don't buy this phone!,Bought this phone for pretty cheap at Wal-Mart - that should've told me something right there. I've had it less than 2 months and all the people I talk with say the reception is terrible on their end and they hear tons of static. I have the volume set all the way up on 8 and can barely hear anything. I came home to 2 messages that were pure static - couldn't hear a word anyone was saying or even who was calling. This is THE biggest piece of junk I've ever purchased. Please save your money and buy a different phone!
2,Wheres the signal?,"its a good phone if you live in a single level dwelling. No good if you have a 2-3 story house. Not a good reception further than 15 ft. I wouldve expected more from a phone that is 5.8Ghz, but I guess you get what you pay for. Unfortunately for me, this one was cheap and it shows it. I found the battery life good and the functions good and easy to use. Its just the reception that lets it down."
2,Not happy with this vtech,"I just bought this exact phone that also came w/ an extra handset at Walmart for $44. I hate it. If I am more than 15 feet from the base it hangs up on the call. It is static all the time and very tinny sounding. Messages left are hard to understand. I don't like the buttons on the base for listening to messages you have to hold it in for like 5 seconds, then let go . .and then sometimes that doesn't work and you have to do it again and you hit delete and sometimes it deletes and sometimes it doesn't. I have call waiting with caller ID so if I'm on a call and someone else tries to call I can see who the 2nd caller is, well this phone doesn't show the # for the second caller. I am going to return it and am checking reviews here to find a brand that is more well-liked by others."
2,"OK phone, but not so good Answering Machine.","It's all about sound quality, and it's not that good in this phone. It also has another interesting (or weird!) feature in the CLOCK. Here's an example: It will say ""Tuesday, 8:45 pm, 2008""(!). WHY on earth it says the year, but not the month?!"
4,Not the best,It makes a clicking noise while you are talking. It is annoying but it works okay otherwise.
3,Spiegelau Vino Grande Chardonnay Glasses,"I was after a replacement set of chard and red glasses for our winter home;we have Spiegelau glasses back in our summer home. Unfortunately,this ""level"" of glass is not ""it"". Even the Spieglelau site could bebetter in defining the ""quality level"". The Vino Grande glasses are OKfor everyday use, but the upper bowl and lip are too thick, imo.Not a wine snob, but the Spiegelau level called ""Authentis"" is probably what I'm after.If you want a thin lip and a higher quality glass, go a grade up from the Vino Grande, imo."
2,Not The Same Stemware As Before,These 'Vino Grande Chardonnay' glasses are less in volume and shorter in height than the Spiegeleau stemware previously sold under the same name.
4,Fine for everyday,"At $7.50 a glass, you won't cry if you break one. The size and shape are ideal (I don't like mammoth glasses), they are sturdy and attractive, and they feel good to drink from. They aren't fine crystal, and a seam is noticeable to the touch on the side of the stem, but for everyday, they are a good buy."
5,brilliant music,"Yesterday i saw the movie with a friend. It was such a moving one that, once again, i experienced the type of shock from ""a beautiful mind"". Similar storytelling and similar story, even the music from these two movies share a lot of similarities. What impressed me most are those short piano works as nice add-ons to show catherine's ambivalent feelings about her dad and her own struggles. there are also works from mozart towards the end of the film that sums up the whole story nicely."
5,A Moving Meditation,I started CD1 & I was dancing & singing or chanting. Each time I listen it entails a new experience. I'm loving it. Thanks !!!
1,Not what I expected or hoped for...,"I am a big fan of Sonias but I honestly could not take that singing, it was too often and too much and too loud. I could not stay relaxed as when I got relaxed he started singing. In my head I was actually begging him to stop singing so obviously I could not relax and focus on the intent of the DVD. I have given it to other friends to try and they could not stand it either because of the singing. I always enjoy her work but this is not what I hoped for, I knew there would be some singing I just did not think it would be so annoying..."
3,This watch is HUGH,"I can't speak for the quality of the movement, but it looked well-made. The problem is that it was HUGH. I am a hefty guy, and the watch was so big it looked rediculous. I sent it back.No problem. Amazon credited me promptly.BTW, if this kind of BLING is for you, the price is right from what I have seen for other Invicta Quinosars on the web."
5,All the hot videos,Jagged Edge still has the potential to be one of the biggest groups in R&B. After four classic albums they released a greatest hits video collection. Like a previous reviewer said it would have been cool to see some live footage and get some slow jam remixes instead of the bass ones.
4,"Title song not my favorite, but rest of album good.",The title song is trite... but the rest of the album has one great piece of music after another. Better than average.JP
3,pretty picture small problems,"Although I loved the picture the puzzle made, the pieces were thin which made them come apart easily."
2,Boring..,"I started of reading this book in the series, thinking the movie ""Ring"" would be enough to understand what happended before ""Spiral"". It didn't. I'm just now reading ""Ring"" since ""Spiral"" made no sense having only seen the movie of the first book.""Spiral"" is not good. It's not terrible either but it leans toward bad rather than good. Suzuki seems to try to incorperate logic thinking into the main characters but the plot is so ludicrous it's not even funny. If Suzuki wants the characters to get the hang of some mystery, he just lets them get an idea based on absolutely nothing, or make conclusions out of totally absurd circumstances, to get them on the right track. It's almost annoying.As far as being a horror novel; this is not a horror novel. It's not scary once."
5,buy it!,"this was definitly one of the best books ive ever read. so many twists and turns. i personally think it was better than the first book, ring. i HIGHLY suggest reading it."
5,Diversity,"My granddaughter requested to add to her Loving Family...she wanted to include ""other kinds of families"" in her Loving Family home."
3,no strap,"I like this cane, except for the lack of a strap on the handle. The Duro-Med that I bought two years ago has a gray soft handle with a strap. How can anyone sell a cane without a strap? I didn't notice this until the cane arrived. Straps are difficult to find, add to the cane's cost, and they don't work as well as the ones attached to the handle. On Amazon, I didn't find a Duro-Med like the one I have. I have found the exact cane I want on the Drive Medical web site, and ordered it."
5,Always Need A Spare,My wife and I both use canes so we don't want to get caught short on a trip to the mall or anywhere else.
5,Great deal and it works!,"I bought this in anticipation of my foot surgery, which just took place. This is a somewhat sturdy cane. Don't let the plastic handle scare you...it is solid. I was playing with the cane at my work when it arrived and several people tried it commenting on how stable it is. Now I am using it to take some pressure off of one foot. I am 5'9"" and use the tallest setting and it is comfortable."
5,Good Cane at a Reasonable Price,"I've used these canes for a number of years after having tried a variety of cane designs. I like this flat handle design, because it allows me to wrap the handle with foam padding, which I secure with duct tape. I frequently replace Futuro brand cane tips for additional cushioning,"
2,fine until the cord broke,"We only used the canes once. They assembled easily, fit into our luggage, and worked well, but the first time we disassembled them (folded them back up) the cord connecting the pieces on one of them broke, making it unusable."
4,"Nice, compact","I was able to fold this up and put it in my average size daypack. I'm 5'6"" but if you are much taller it might not fit in a daypack, because you'd have to lengthen the cane, and that impacts the length when folded. The cane was comfortable to use when unfolded."
5,Great walking assist,"I am on a trip to Italy and using the cane each day, Would be a missrable trip with out it as the walking is up and down hills on cobblestone streets that have been here for hundreds of years."
4,Handy folding cane,It is always hard to find a place to put one's cane in a restaurant or in church or anywhere. The folding cane makes it easier to store it.
2,P-U,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009STMXY/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThis cane has an unpleasant odor when folded and the cord inside is exposed. The cane also has no wrist strap making it difficult to use both hands when looking at items in a store. When I look for the car keys from my purse I have to look for a surface to lay the cane on because it certainly doesn't stand up by itself. I find it strange that the less expensive cane that I purchased is odor free, has a strap, and is more attractive. Go figure."
4,Easy to use!,"I really like this cane. It's compact and easy to assemble and disassmeble. It is very sturdy and comfortable in my hand. The only thing I don't like that much is the case, but that's a minor issue with me."
4,A compact folding cane,"I was surprised at how compact this cane was when folded and how stable it is when open. It's ideal for using in conjunction with a walker, or to have on hand when traveling. The only down sides are that its folded size increases as the length of the cane is adjusted and that the ""locking nut"" for length really is a sleeve rather than a locking nut."
1,USER,"You did not mention the extend, in inches, this cane can be adjusted. I'll spend a couple more dollars and buy the Carex adjustable cane instead."
3,Great for taller people...,"I rated this cane as 3-star because it is, in fact, very sturdy, comfortable and compact; however it is only good for people 5'4"" andover. I'm 5'3"" and have it at the lowest setting and it is still above the wrist. Still, I can use it for times I get tired."
4,"I dig Roman numerals, and jewelry...","so buying this little ring was a no-brainer.It came quickly and appears just as it's pic shows.Fits a lil snug for the size listed, but not uncomfortably.A good buy for the price if you're looking for a simple ring with features it lists.I say it's a 4* piece."
5,One sweet tool,"I have dozen or so jewelry pliers, ranging in quality from no-names to Lindstrom Rx. Tronex tools are top drawer in my book. I've had the Tronex tapered relief cutters for quite a while and love them.I just got the chain nose pliers and it's an awesome tool to behold. Nicely tapered, well balanced, the blue grips are very comfortable to hold, the points line up perfectly; simply beautiful. I'm going to start saving up again to get the flat nose pliers.It's a treat to own these wonderful USA-made tools."
2,Disappointed,"I bought several of the Tronex pliers because I was happy to see that they were made in the USA, and had decent reviews.With the cost of these, you would expect high quality.I agree with the other reviewers about the comfort of these pliers, as they are great in that regard. However, after only 1 month of use,my chainnose pliers broke at the rivet. I called the company and they told me to ship them back and they'd look at them. They determined that I used themto bend too heavy of a wire, and told me that they wouldn't be exchangeable, but would replace them with a factory second, just this one time.I was using them to for a crimp bead, ridiculous! Well, needless to say, it wasn't long before the second pair snapped the same way as the first. I'll bebuying Lindstom from now on."
4,buyer satisfied,"It was a good order. The product was in great condition, but it took too long to get to me."
4,A good start.,Quite interesting that a cookie habit snowballs into espionage. This is a good start for JT. I look forward to his next sci-fi books.
4,Funny,"I was surprised that the book contains an undertone of comedy, which is rare in most science fiction books. I especially enjoyed the Fay's Homestyle cookies, as a concept. It was funny to see that the heroes weakness, was an over indulgence in cookies. That happens to led him and his friends into a under world of corporate espionage. Weird, but funny! I'm looking forward to more books from John T. Taylor and more of those cookies."
5,Very interesting,"I would like to welcome Mr.Taylor into the ranks of authors, whom have tried our best to contribute through science fiction(future)! Beasts of the Harvest Moon made for very good reading because it touched upon the human condition, which as we all know is not perfect. His main character Jonathan Rex, struggles with his own weaknesses as a greedy man and through sheer will finds a way to evolve and help others! The added twists of plot from the metaphysical and the secret world of corporate espionage has many points of personal reflection. Beasts of the Harvest Moon takes us on a FUN journey and leaves us wanting more. John T. Taylor shows much promise, and I look forward to many visions of his future society!"
4,Worth watching very interesting.,"It is sad that healthy foods are more difficult to buy with a food stamp budget. I do not have food stamps, but I do have a strict food budget and choose to eat healthy. It is difficult, but I know it will payoff in the long run."
3,Informative but a little too optimistic,"Yes this film was informative and I wouldn't tell people not to watch it. Just to take it with a grain of salt. The filmmakers decided to go on the ""food stamps diet"" where they could only spend about $1 per person per meal. They vowed to only eat healthy, organic food during this week. The continually ignored difficulties faced by those on food stamps by doing things such as taking herbs from their herb garden (many of the people on food stamps don't even have a home). They also did not take into account that most people do not have their kind of background on cooking organically and would never be able to make the sorts of meals that they made...especially if they are homeless with no real kitchen. While the filmmakers tried to do something good, their lightheartedness as well a their optimism that everyone can eat well on a food stamp diet was off-putting."
3,Food stamp diets.,"I felt the whole movie was about vegitarianism. Eggs were the only animal proton they had in the diet. And they still came up 300 cal a day short of the 2000 they were supposed to eat a day. They followed a few food stamp people in the stores but took nothing away from what the people were telling them. Even though they ate on a food stamp budget they did not live on a low income for the week, where they would have to make other choices like gas for the car or pay the eletric bill. That would have been more of a quality challenge."
3,Not so great,"I really wanted to like this movie and had high hopes it would reveal the near impossibilty of eating a healthy diet on the food stamp allotment. Mostly, the documentor was whiney and insecure while her easy going husband just went along with it. Very little was proven, except that people on food stamps generally opt for volume over nutrition. The presenters were able to eat healthy for week with food stamps, but were under nourished (too few calories), and spent an enormous amount of time preparing food. The big drama was dumpster diving and finding enough money to buy a challah bread for their Friday night Jewish meal. I really wish they had gone more in depth about the travesty of the food stamp budget, how it is nearly impossible to feed a family in a healthy way on this allotment and also provide some suggestions for families who are in a food stamp situation so that they can make healther choices with what they have to work with."
3,Decent,"I like the decision not to compromise on their diet and lifestyle while struggling with the ""Food Stamps diet"". The documentary also points out the so so school lunches options which I think deserves attention.The documentary states that the average food stamp recipient get a dollar worth of food stamps. The protagonists choose $1 food stamp supplement per meal. The premise is wrong because food stamps is distributed as a per need basis. They would need to provide some of they own money towards food. Richard in the movie who did not have a job and very low on money, he got approximately $2 per meal which is close to the full amount.Why are lawmakers so unimaginative when it comes to cooking on the ""food stamps diet"". The best they can come up with is ramen and lentils. They just reverted to their college days.I do believe we need better food choices especially for the poor."
5,Don't Get No Bettah than this,"OK, A friend of a friend caught this group in Florida, bought the CD (also ""Edge of the Swamp"") ripped it for them, they for me and their superlatives were right on the mark.I'm a harp player and the harp licks are the way backup is supposed to be - not overdone and perfect timing. The mixing is also top notch. Do yoself a kindness and put this on your Ipod under 'My Top Rated'"
3,Smokehouse,"Typical 90's swamp blues, tradesman like, tight, they can swing it but they are not major league. There are other southern boogie outfits better than these guys but they are giving it their best shot."
4,Overcoming shyness,"This book is about a shy hermit crab named Hector. One morning, Hector wakes up to find that a flower has grown on his shell. He tries everything to get the flower off, but nothing works. Indeed, by the next morning, the flower grows even bigger. Hector is mortified by his odd appearance, but the other crabs seem to find it quite attractive. They gather round Hector, and soon Hector has a new group of friends. The story is quite cute and not at all scary. The book has about 200 words."
3,Promises more than it delivers,"In his introductory remarks, LeGoff promises to situate the evolution of the concept of Purgatory in a broad socio-cultural context, and to show how it influenced and was influenced by developments in society's and individuals' self-understanding in the period ca. 1000-1300. Such a micro-analytic material-ideological hermeneutical exegesis would be, IMO, exciting indeed. Alas, where the connections are made, they are only cursorily asserted or alluded to. Although the topic of the birth of Purgatory, i.e., a certain focused change in medieval Christian cosmography, seems a narrow enough subject to cover in 350 pages, this book gives the feeling of almost being ""out of breath"" in trying to cover too much territory, so that the depth of engagement with the material is not satisfying."
5,Loved this book,My 9 year old son loved this book. He learned a lot of good values from someone he really admires. I highly recommend this book.
3,Fabric - 'Woolly Mammoth' (Hep-Cat),"I barely remember getting this title as used, for 50 cents {I believe}, even back a short while after it was released. Best described as 'indie pop' from this trio that comes from Bloomington, Indiana. Tunes here I sort of liked were ""Deaf Baby"", the funloving ""Rubberman"", the off-the-wall ""Inside A Bowling Pin"" and the rather upbeat ""Shame And Pearl"". Line-up: Chris Kupersmith-guitar & vocals, Tina Barbieri-bass and Scott Ewing-keyboards. Might appeal to the Flaming Lips, White Stripes, Sonic Youth and maybe Ween."
5,Bennett Sandals,I was very impressed with both the quality and the style of this sandal. Actually seeing the shoe on a girl made these sandals even hotter. Very nice stuff and I would definately buy another pair of her shoes.
5,TKB = Pet Sounds + [The White Album Let's Get Small],"Borrowing equally from vaudeville, folk, 80s synth-pop and rap, TKB's eponymous debut is an absolute blast to listen to. Think The Everly Brothers meet The Smothers Brothers, with a dash of Tom Waits and a hint of Monty Python. TKB, each strong musicians and storytellers in their own right, have crafted an album that's as fun as it is original. Now that's MY kind of show."
2,do you like molding ridges and wavy glass?,"I got a set because the photo looked good. When they arrived, I felt molding ridges in the stem (but mostly they had been ground off of the foot), and saw wavy distortions in the bowls from uneven glass thickness and shape. These aspects bothered me so much I returned the glasses. You must decide where you want to be on the quality vs. price spectrum, but be aware that these are much worse quality than, for instance, the Hungarian blown glasses from Williams-Sonoma."
1,defective glasses,"My glasses had air bubbles and abnormally shaped blobs of glass where the stems connect to the bowls. They were functional.... but deformed. I sent them back. In addition, molding lines were visible, but not so bad."
1,leaded glass for wine,"I am sure that leaded glass for drinking has been shown to be very liable to result in lead in the beverage. The longer it holds the beverage, the more lead disolves. I believe these glasses are not fit for human use!Joseph Crilly"
1,What a disappointment!!,This is outdated software sold under a 'Deluxe 2003' title. The Fashion Makeover website to download updated fashions was discontinued in Sept 2000. So when it pops up on your screen your wardrobe is outdated--their isn't anything you can do to update it--(After much frustration I found the distributor advises you of this on their website but not in the packaging.) Leaving limited fashions. I found the makeup application to resemble a coloring book and crayon style. I returned all 4 I purchased as gifts. What a shame it has not been updated.
1,Total Waste of Money,"I purchased the first version of Cosmo's Virtual Makeover and thought it was good. I figured that 2003, the third version, would be great. I was VERY disappointed. The user interface is .... Nothing works as you would expect. The Help files are in the wrong place. There are very few hairstyles and they never put in the download area they promised. Cosmo says they discontinued that portion of the program, however they NEVER REALLY STARTED! The program designers should be ashamed of themselves."
1,Disgusted,"program came with no instructions; constantly getting error messages; there is nothing simple about using it, since I haven't been able to get it to do anything at all."
1,Minimal story - mostly sexual fantasy,"I am disgusted with this ""romance"" novel. It seems it was just written as an excuse to print sexual fantasies, with a minimal story plot that enables it to move from one fantasy to another. I didn't even finish reading it. I'm sorry I wasted my time and money on it."
3,Just okay .......,I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone but if u get stuck reading it.....u can get thru it.....it could have been soooooo much better....it's like the writer got the idea and started it then had to finish it fast......kinda predictable .... save your money.......too many good books out there to choose from.
2,Again???,"Well written, but way too predictable. I want to be suprised by a story, not know where it is going from the very first chapter. This is the same as the last book in the series, just different names and locations. Author needs new ideas badly!"
2,Thin & break easily,"Target stopped carrying the Goody brand kid-size clear hair ties that I use for my toddler so I tried these. Work OK for one, maybe two uses but stretch with one use and break easily. Won't buy these again as I've now found the Goody brand on Amazon."
4,"Good bands, don't bite into hair.","Package came right on time. As they are plastic and elastic, they aren't as reusable as rubber bands, but they don't bite into my hair, either, so am pleased with them."
5,Nice glasses,"These glasses are a bit small for red wine glasses, in fact they are only a bit larger than the std line Spiegetau white wine glasses I already had.However, for every day use the will suit me just fine. And most peaple unless they are real wine conesuers."
1,Spiegelau Red Wines Glasses,"I received red wine glasses without stems instead of as pictured. I returned them for credit and have still not received word of my refund. Since this was not my mistake but a shipping error, I expect a full refund. When I tried to e-mail about it, I received a run around about my address and password. This is very frustrating. I reordered the wine glasses since this was to be a gift and the next set came (with stems) and are beautiful!"
4,"Tough crystal, I hope","I got these glasses for a couple whose wine glasses are constantly getting broken. They previously got the Schott-Zweisel Forte (titanium) wine glasses (Cabernet/merlot), and these have been broken.It is too soon to tell if this reinforced crystal will last any better, but they are very nice glasses. They are good size, give the requisite chime upon clinking glasses and are very good-looking."
4,High quality for the price,"These were my first good (ie crystal) stems. Three survived through two years of college- not bad.If you aren't using crystal glasses yet, seriously consider these. They are fairly durable (they seem more sturdy and heavier than the normal riedels). I drank red and white from these glasses, and although I've since bought varietal-specific stems, you really don't need that. I thought these were fine for all varietals I had in them. (Although I gotta say, it's nice having a really big, bulbous burgundy glass for red and white burgundy- probably any varietal actually).Maybe the best thing about these is that you don't have to worry about them too much. They would definitely be my choice for a 'desert island' stem (or college, or bachelor pad).My one complaint is that they seemed to cloud a bit with several years of use (small scratches?). Still, it was a minor issue."
2,not wonderful for red wine,"I bought these because they are advertised as ""vino grande red wine glasses."" I bought a similar-titled item 2-3 years ago but they had a different and more red-wine-friendly shape. Actually, they are more suited for white wine or a desert wine. Red Wine likes a large bowl with a thin lip. The glass is high end (spiegelau is wonderful) but the bowl is not large. If you prefer a barolo or cabernet type wine, you would be advised to purchase the ""burgundy"" or ""bordeaux"" glass which is better suited for most red wines."
2,Reviews VERY misleading,"Got what I ordered in a timely manner - 25 red, yellow, white, blue and green prayer flags measuring 8"" x 5.5"" strung on a white string wrapped tightly in rubber bands, meaning they'll have to be ironed or whatever before you string them. I did NOT get any of the nice little extras that the other reviewers mentioned. No incense, no letter, no business cards, nada......just two sets of prayer flags with a healthy shipping charge. These were to be a gift so I'm disappointed. Bad karma Tom. If policy has changed, these reviews should be deleted."
3,See-through flags.,"The material is transparent. This is one thing I did not like. The images printed on the flags were nice, but difficult to see."
3,good price but not washable,"good price, nice scarf but dry clean only, which was a surprise when I purchased it."
1,"I'd give this zero stars, if I could.","I could entertain the notion that the author really doesn't know much about the subject at hand. The omissions and lack of detail are stunning. Imagine the author dumping the man pages and other Solaris documentation into wordprocessor files and arranging them into imagined ""Administrator Guides"" and you have an idea of what might have happened."
1,Almost useless reference,"I've used a variety of unixes for over 10 years, but I hadn't used a sun since the pre-solaris days. After our company got a couple of ultrasparcs, I tried to use the two Janice Winsor books as references for setting them up, but I found them completely useless. The very first task I needed to do was set up the network interfaces, but, nearly impossible to believe, I could find nothing on the subject in the two books. Then, I needed to set up the suns to resolve addresses through our DNS ibstead of the default NIS. Again, there was no help I could find in the books. A number of other times I went looking for information in the books, I was unable to solve my problems. I ended up using Sun's online docs, which are much more comprehensive and told me exactly what I needed."
1,Another Solaris Book,"This is in response to the general, ""This is all there is"" feeling from most of the other comments. For those who are disappointed with this book and looking for another, check out Sobell's A Practical Guide to SOLARIS. It's comprehensive and very well written. I hope this helps people find a better resource for their Solaris needs. (No, I'm not the author or affiliated in any way. I just bought it and am very happy with it.)"
1,What a waste of money.,"The Administrator's guide is OK. But this one, the Advanced System Administrator's Guide is terrible. I finished the shell script part and the the first two parts. I find out the authors did not explain things clearly. I got confused from time to time. The written style is so boring that one will lost interests easily. Sometimes I had to force myself to read further chapters. I am not sure the author know the subject very well herself. It is totally a waste of money and time for me. I would give a 0 star is there is such option."
3,Spend Your Money Elsewhere,"Neither of these system administration books (System Administrator's Guide and Advanced) deal with substantive issues like mirroring, DNS, auditing and file system creation/design. The author writes without enthusiasm and appears to have little first hand knowledge of the subject."
2,"""HATED IT""",BOTH MY THREE YEAR OLD AND MY SEVEN YEAR OLD WERE BORED TO TEARS WITH THIS GAME. IT WAS QUICKLY TOSSED ASIDE.
4,It's a little different from what I expected,I expected bigger book but the book itself was very small. However the CD that's included contained 12 stories. SO I am generally satisfied with this item.
3,Sizing,"This boot are great in quality, i bought them to spend the winter in Russia, the main problem is the sizing, I am a size 12 and so i ordered the correct size, the problem is that the shoe vestibility is 1/2 a size bigger so be adviced, order 1/2 a size smaller!!!!"
3,Echos from another era.,"The author swings both ways and wants it that way.The first couple of chapters are ""refreshing"" and enlighting but soon her way of life becomes sex-laden and onerous and sometimes downright dangerous. She seems to have been a torch-carrier in her time, today it all seems far, far away."
1,It had its ups and downs,"At times, I really liked the book. Then it got disappointing: especially since it was an assignment. My reccomendation? Skip it. There are a couple times when you can really get into it and then there are the more common times when you can barely stand it. Not worth it!"
3,Good read.,"...*** The story line is great and the plot is sound, however, there is way too much back tracking in this book. Roland would go to the Elves then quickly decide he had to return to his father. But en route to his father, he would quickly decide he needed to return to the Elven Princess. Upon arriving he would decide he needed to reach his father, the King.Other than feeling as though I were traveling from one kingdom to the next often, the story was rich in magic, romance, duty, battles, and legends! Steavil was a strong character that I liked immediately and readers will easily relate to him and all he must go through. A great story well worth the time to read! ***"
2,Couldn't get it to seal,I tried twice to get this to seal to the intake but it would always leak.I put the old one back on and it sealed the first time.It's a nice product and I'm far from being new to installing them but thisone gave me fits.Woody
3,"A Nice example of Heather Nova's work, but at least one track is noisy","This is a wonderful CD in general but track #3 has a LOT of background noise in the right channel, for some reason. You can hear it on Amazon's samplecuts here, by the way, so it's not a bad CD copy that I got.Not particularly professionally done, I'm sorry to say."
3,Not all that exciting!,"I've been reading through Margaret Frazer's series with Sister Frevisse, and I found this book not very exciting and there's not much mystery here. Normally I enjoy Ms. Frazer's books, but this one was not my favourite. In this book Sister Frevisse is called to a funeral for her beloved uncle, Thomas Chaucer. While at the funeral feast one of the nobles that is present gets in an argument and says, ""May God stike me dead, if what I say isn't the truth!"" Then sure enough he is overcome with some sort of attack and can't catch his breath. He later dies from this and Sister Frevisse is asked by a distant relative (who is a bishop) to find out what actually happened. Of course, it wasn't a sign of God, and she does discover the killer, but so had I. I figured it out long before the ending of the book. I will continue to read this series, but I do hope that it gets interesting again."
4,A medieval jewel.,"I think A Bishop's Tale, set in the late medieval period, is a very good read. The author, Margaret Frazer, did a great job with research, setting and characterization.She built believable characters, with flaws and depth. I can't wait to start on the rest of the series."
5,Best in historical mysteries,"All the Sister Frevisse mysteries are a pleasure to read. Not only are the characters well drawn, the historical details don't mire the tale but enhance it. You will come away with more knowledge of 1400s England as well as a well plotted mystery."
4,"EM: pearls, the best text available for EM written bords","This book has system based chapters, plenty of open ended questions in each chapter. The final chapters are ""imaging"" and randomised questions which are great for a final review before the exam. You should also look at their oral board review text, which is even better (ISBN 1-58409-021-9). The questions that are there are mainly things that one ought to know when he is about to write the ABEM or CCFP-EM exams. It probably does not have enough esoteric questions for FRCP trainees. I sat down at our university book store when buying this book, and compared it to the others on the market (esp ""pre-test"") and found it to be superior. The one that I did not see is ""PEER-V"" put out by ACEP, but I hear that it is excellent."
5,Heartwarming,"The Christmas Spurs was one of the best books I have ever read. My son picked this book as a daily reading assignment, but we both enjoyed the story. We laughed, we cried, we laughed some more and our hearts were full of joy."
5,Wow,"This is a hidden gem - apparently no longer available - but virtually every recipe is very tasty - not just tasty for diet cooking, but tasty by any standard."
5,Great for someone new to quilling,"I saw this book on clearance at a local craft store. The front cover caught my attention. I thought the crimped bows were so unique- looking. Once I opened the book I saw the different quilling examples . . . what an inspiration! I purchased the book, bought the suggested supplies, (I had to order them on-line) which were very inexpensive, and then taught myself basic techniques using the author's instructions (Quilling Basics section). I am a beginner quiller and this book has been very helpful. Now its time for me to apply what I have learned to actual projects!"
2,Don't waste your money!,"This book was released at the same time as one by Allison Bartkowski - which is far, far superior. The projects in here are mediocre, at best (e.g., an alphabet or Chinese symbol entirely comprised of round coils, which look ugly. When paying $20 for a book, you deserve to be told which shapes - and arrangement - will be appealing. Another problem is the lack of resources listed - e.g., it calls for a Chinese coin stamp, but gives no hint where to purchase one, and I wasted many hours on Google searching in vain. The entire book is like that - mediocre (or ugly) designs, very vague, insufficient directions, and no hint of where to purchase materials.In short, don't waste your money. The Bartkowski book is far superior (as is Malinda Johnston's masterpiece, which is older but still excellent)."
1,The New Paper Quilling by Molly Smith Christensen,"The New Paper Quilling might be an excellent start for beginners, but the projects were uninspiring and there were no new or improved techniques to pique my interest. I was very disappointed.JV Miller"
5,The new paper Quilling bok,"The book arrived on time, payment process went smoothly and the book was received in excellent condition. My wife, who I bought this for, tells me it's an excellent book for anyone who wants an easy to follow introduction into paper quilling. Lots of handy hints and ideas.."
4,Great Book,"If you love quilling with a difference then you'll love this book, heaps of new ideas and techniques which are easy to learn. I'm going to enjoy each and every project."
4,"Interesting Passages, Good Questions","My students found these passages interesting. With the various activities, the students developed an understanding of referencing the text, and I was able to guage their comprehension well. However, the multiple choice questions are more knowledge-based (literal). They do not require a lot of inferencing/drawing conclusions."
4,"Read and Understand Science, Grades 3-4","I really like the way this book is set up - it's got a lot of interesting information presented in a variety of ways. It's a good introduction to many aspects of science in a clear, concise manner."
4,Popular Dishes by Emily Marion Colling,"This is a great Old Cook Book. Very informative, Very unusual and different dishes including Cheese straws. If you can get your hands on this book get it."
5,Low sexual desire is not a disease!,"This book is truly great. My boyfriend and I used to fight about sex a lot. I was convinced there was something wrong with me. After reading this book, I no longer felt like I had some kind of disease. My boyfriend and I read sections together, it was fun to read, very reassuring and I followed many of the suggestions Dr. Hall gave for getting desire back. And they worked! I highly recommend this book to everyone in a relationship - don't wait until the fighting about sex gets bad, read this book now."
4,A Guide That's Insightful And Helpful,"Dr. Hall is clearly a very bright and talented therapist. Her ideas and counsel are things that are not only thought-provoking, but that I was able to actually use to improve my interaction with my husband. While not always easy because there's real honesty and work involved, the book was incredibly helpful for my relationship -- which was, frankly, a surprise given how little many books of this sort offer. Dr. Hall's book is insightful, has been beyond beneficial to my sense of self -- not just my sense of my own sexuality -- and has been worth infinitely more than the modest price."
2,Another book on how to fix women,"Ms. Hall could have written a more interesting book titled: ""The Sexual Socialization of Males and How it Contributes to the Epidemic of Diminshed Libido in Women"", instead, once again, the onus is placed on the woman to ""fix"" her low libido, while the sexually abusive culture she exists within, remains the same. Maybe lost libido is natures healthy response to the culture we live in, which does more to harm a woman's sexual development than help it. Not only do women have to deal with objectification, negative cultural messages about their intrinsic worth and purpose, as well as the threat of rape, but they should have a robust libido in the midst of all this. Ridiculous."
3,"great book for newcomers, not so great for loyalists","This is a great little book if you've never read a greg easterbrook column. It's a good book if you've read one column and enjoyed it. It's pretty dull if you are a loyal reader of his columns. Easterbrook has a few key ideas. (Stop me before I blitz again; no, that's not a *double* reverse; coach + parka = loss; cheerleaders are hot, etc.) Each tuesday it's fun to see how they are apply to the previous weekend's games, but here, the book seems like just a poor rehash of his columns. Even some of the Haiku has been in his columns already.If you've never read Easterbrook, buy the book, then read his columns (now on ESPN Page 2). If you are an Easterbrook loyalist, don't buy the book for yourself, but maybe give it someone else (after flipping through to read the Haiku)."
2,Gregg Easterbrook could have put together a much better book,"I am a pretty avid fan of Gregg Easterbrook's writing for Slate and now ESPN. I bought this book expecting it to be of the same quality as the columns. Quite honestly, I would have settled for simply the material given in the columns with no improvement. Instead this book takes same material that is so interesting in the columns (the importance of fake kicks, proper sideline attire for cold weather, unusual college mascots) and presents them so quickly that they lose both their humor and informativeness. Part of the problem is that Easterbrook's observations seem much keener in the column, applied to last weekend's games, but I think Easterbrook still could have written a much better book, and I hope he does."
1,There is no credibility in this offering.,"I am of the opinion that authors should know a little something about their subject. Call me crazy, but I do. This collection of pages was clearly written by a person who has never stepped foot on a football field in his life. This putz clearly has not."
1,Easterbrook is a clown,"The football gods will punish this dufus for ""writing"" this tripe. He wouldn't recognize a football if it hit him in the nutz."
2,Not very original,"This has all the elements of any common dysfunctional family movie, were one brother is bad while the other is good. If you like chinese murder, rape and torcher movies then by all mean buy it; but I would recomend you don't waist your money."
3,Roy Buchanan Live from Austin,"I was a bit disapointed with this DVD. Great Tele chops, but the vocals are grim. Too short also, not many songs. Still, it's a part of history though."
5,One of the best.,Roy Buchanan is one of the best ever. This DVD is top flight as far as quality goes. A great concert very much worth purchasing.
5,This is an Awesome tool!,"This is totally cool. I ordered this from Hardware Sales Inc. It was missing its charger and battery when delivered, but they were prompt in responding and they are on the way. The nail gun is not all that heavy, does not need the few seconds warm up time like an impulse, and no propane smell either. It shoots as fast as I need it too, no delays. Best of all, I already have a battery system to support it."
4,A great help,"Well worth the investment......depending on your level of study, some info may be re-hash.On the whole the information is very helpful."
3,Dainty beer glasses,"These were smaller than I expected. I prefer a more robust glass when serving beer. So far, it seems that the ""Grande"" in Spiegelau's Vino Grande line is a misnomer. These glasses and the bonus set of Vino Grande highballs that came with it are quite small."
2,total let down!!,"I bought this book after buying nirvana unplugged cd. I expected so much more from this book. The book to be honest was a disappointment and a waste of money.I found that the songs weren't tabbed in a way you could play them. Some songs were made much more harder that they ought to be. For example there are occasions when power chords were tabbed when it was obvious kurt was strumming the guitar. Notice this book isn't tabbed by Nirvana, its been tabbed by someone else and is subsequently their opinion how the songs are played.However the illustrations are good, and some of the songs have been tabbed correctly.There are better Nirvana books out there, leave this one alone."
4,German Unit Divisional History,"I own this book, bought 1975. Lots of photo's of equipment and personnel, B&W;, no color. Includes some maps, unit TO & E's, drawings and other material. Written by the vveterans of this unit for their fellows. German language with some english translations. A typical Podzun-Pallas Verlag product. Photo's mostly cover early to mid-war period. Later period photo's are mostly personal photo's of various Officers and men. English translations leave much to be desired, some experience with German language / German military abbreviations is helpful.At the time (1970's) these books were hard to obtain although many are now available in re-print. I used them as reference for war-gaming and model kit building. Worth getting if you are a historian or book collector."
2,Fascinating if undocumented,"Sadly this volume does not include any prefatory matter. No description of which tribes the recipes are from nor any history of the recipes. The imprint on the inside cover says Pawnee, Oklahoma copyright 1972. From this we can surmise that the recipes are Pawnee in nature though this is just speculation. In any case the 16 pages are filled with interesting recipes including Dried Meat, Hominy Fritters, Acorn Soup, Fried Meat Pies, Persimmon Cookies and Grape Dumplings. Various Indian symbols are used in the book and a legend defining the symbols is included on the inside of the back cover."
3,beware,"the bottom line is that unless you REALLY know what your doing you can easily misinterpret things. not a good idea. its interesting, but dont take yourself to seriously afterwords."
2,Piece of ...,"This book is so boring. Handwriting analysis is a fascinating subject, but this book is poorly written. It has all the facts, but I didn't like how it was written. I fell asleep in the first chapter. Good info., bad presentation"
5,Another Great Book,"This one has a little bit of everything....Romance, mystery, and great characters....As much as I love Miss Thomas' historicals, Her contemporaries are just as engrossing and I almost feel like I know the townspeople by heart....I heard this author just won the national book award for Finding Mary Blaine, and have no doubt this book will be a strong contender as well..."
5,The secret is out,"In my opinion, Jodi Thomas can do NO wrong! Unlike some authors, Mrs. Thomas handles a host of main characters with ease. From the onset, I related to each of the main characters...from the spinster-like college professor, to the misundertsood bad-boy, to the down-on-her luck cheerleader. The characters, although unlikely accomplices, help to decided the fate of Rosa Lee's estate as they uncover the truth about themselves. Great read!"
5,The best,Just started reading Jodi Thomas and this is the best book I have ever read. I am book number 3 and enjoying reading again
2,Disappointing,"The Secrets of Rosa Leeby Jodi ThomasReviewer: Pamela Ackerson (author of Home of the Braves Trilogy)I enjoy Jodi Thomas's books but this time I was disappointed. With each page I turned I felt as if I had read the book before, even though I know I hadn't. There were times during the story when I was confused and had to flip back and reread sections to see if I could understand what I missed. Sometimes, I couldn't find what I missed and it left me wanting. I'm not sure if it is Ms. Thomas's writing in this book or if her content editor wasn't on target. Normally, I find Ms. Thomas's books engaging and moving, this time--well, we all have our off days. I will still grab her books to read."
1,JUST MAYBE NOT A GOOD DAY FOR ME TO READ!,I was so upset as this was nothing like the Historical Romances that Jodi writes. Only read if you like comtempary writings. It lagged and did not hold my interest either. I could have just been having a bad day so this is my humble opinion.
2,The Secrets of Rosa Lee,"As a diverse group of community members forms a committee to determine the fate of a lovely mansion, secrets begin to emerge that move an unseen person to make threats. If the house falls, then the secrets will be forever buried, and the mysterious person will be safe, or so they think. Potential secrets are not all that might be unearthed. Feelings are brought to light as relationships shift and find new meanings during the course of decision making. Aged sisters with a penchant for rose stealing, a rugged sheriff, a fiesty waitress, a preacher who does not meet the conventional image of a stuffy man of God, and others find their lives converging as the secrets of Rosa Lee come to light.** Though there are bright moments to the book and strong characterizations, it has a rambling quality that makes it easy to fall off of the plot path. As much as I love appealing characters, more focus is needed on the plot to make them work. **"
3,Cute ideas!,"This book has a lot of cute ideas, but I found that they are hard to recreate because they include a lot of free hand art. I enjoy looking at the pages, some of which are very elaborate and beautiful, but with my limited artistic abilities I have a hard time duplicating what I see in the book."
5,Very Cute for Teenagers,This product is very cute for teenagers that are about to go to college or get there first apartment.
4,Manichaeaism in Central Asia and China,"This is the author's second volume of selected articles on Manichaeism (the first volume, Manichaeism in Mesopotamia & the Roman East, is also published by Brill, 1994), and contains studies on the history and texts of the sect in Central Asia and especially in China. It also contains a working catalog of published Manichaean texts from Central Asia, Egypt and North Africa which is published here for the first time. Several of the essays were published early in Lieu's research career and such is the pace of research and discovery in Manichaean studies that they have all been substantially revised, updated and expanded for this book. Highly recommended."
1,Not as Described,This sword is advertised to have a brass guard when in fact it is only a brass color that is cheaply dipped over some type of metal. We understand now why it was priced as low as it is as it is a cheap wall hanger that should be hidden in a dark area of your room. Will I buy from this seller again? Likely not.
4,Easy watching,"I must admit that I was a little disappointed that the dvd's were region 1 and I thought that I would be able to recode them to region 4 for my Grandson, but I wasn't able to do this. So unless you watch them on the computer screen they are useless!! And of course I can't send them back.."
1,Does Not Age Well,"Some series just don't lose the excitement and enrichment of watching no matter how old the series is. However this is not one of those series.Yes, we all love Flipper, the dolphin, but the storyline (even for the young) isn't well written and extremely boring and predictable. It's hard now to look back on this series as anything but a long drawn out boring series that probably could have been made into a 3 part mini-series. Meaning; totally over priced for the quality of a series."
5,One of the Best Programs Ever Made,"I bought this to watch with my three-year-old daughter. I had no idea the whole family would love it so much and no recollection as to how good this program is. I'm 37 now and I haven't watched Flipper since I was a little kid. I remember thinking it would be so cool to have my own dolphin and I thought Flipper was so smart, but I had pretty much forgotten the rest. Surprisingly, even though this appeals to children, it is really adult orientated; the themes are adult (ie., a man has been poisoned by a dangerous fish and is laying dying in his submarine; will the ranger find him in time to save him?).This is also a refreshing video to share with children. The boys in this video are respectful to the father and obedient to adults. Adults are intelligent and in charge (unlike in modern kids' shows). Problems are ultimately solved by the grown-ups. Refreshing."
5,When will Flipper Season 2 be released on DVD???,"I tried many things online over the past few months, but cannot get any info on WHEN the second season of ""Flipper"" will finally be released on DVD. Does anybody know?After all there are 89 episodes existing, but all we got so far are the first 30 episodes from season 1."
3,Where is disk 4?,"We loved Disk 1-3, however, upon attempting to watch Disk 4 - the onscreen menu said it was Disk 3 (even though labeled as Disk 4) and all episodes were Disk 3 again! So, no Disk 4 in the box. Sent it back for refund. Ordered new one....SAME PROBLEM!! Again, sent back for refund. This was VERY frustrating!! We must've been unlucky to get two bad batches? No explanation from Amazon. We did NOT order it for a third time due to the lack of quality control! Has this happened to anyone else? Loved Disk 1-3 though!!"
5,Flipper,"In my opinion, TV shows such as Flipper were what TV was meant to be, intertainment. I have not seen this wonderful show since it first aired back in 1964. How wonderful it is to see such a beautiful, clear transfer to DVD. Flipper is great family entertainment and I highly recommend this set to anyone who loves classic television."
3,Musical Irish Angel Jewelry Box,"It's a pretty music box that I ordered for a gift, but I was a little disappointed on it's quality. It's more fragile than I had hoped and I would have looked further if I had checked a little closer. I would have gone with a painted wooden one instead."
2,Dreadful,"When ""Captain America"" was relaunched under Marvel Comics' ""Marvel Knights"" imprint, it began with about a year of good, solid, thought-provoking stories by John Ney Rieber. Then, for no apparent reason, Rieber was removed from the book in the middle of this story arc and replaced by Chuck Austen, who treated us to inane characters, insipid dialogue and contrived soap opera plotlines that were enough to get me to drop the book. (And having been a Captain America reader for close to a decade, that was not an easy drop for me to make.)As far as the artwork goes, Jae Lee did a marvelous job as always. He manages to fit superheroes into his darker style without losing what makes them majestic in the process. But he was saddled with such a lousy story and bad dialogue that you just wind up wishing he could have given his talents to something more deserving instead."
1,Not Cap's Finest Hour,"While the artwork in this compilation is very sharp, I was disappointed with the overall storyline. The characterization of Cap was unnatural, at times, and the plot was often implausible. Was the storyline politically charged? I'll leave that for the reader to decide on their own. If you are interested in this book, I would suggest tracking it down at your local library as opposed to buying it. It is not one you will want to keep around after suffering through it once."
3,Ok for basics,"If you aren't doing anything too complex this will be fine, but don't fool yourself into thinking this will make you into a mechanic."
1,Save trees and retire this dog,"This book was required for my college class. It is clearly designed for the student who enjoys reading textbooks over and over again, just to find the smallest bit of information; versus those who need information fast and reliable.Not designed for modern day accelerated learning. There are barely any examples and no callouts.The authors must be simply trying to get their 35 pages per chapter quota. It would be interesting to see what this book would be like if they were compensated based upon student comprehension instead."
5,Great Value,I looked at several everyday wine glass sets & these are the best value.Very well made & attractive. Can be used for every day or special occasions.
5,love it,The burgundy wine glasses are beautifully made and well-balanced holding in your hand. The quality is excellent and I would buy this brand over and over again.
5,Spiegelau Vino Grande Burgundy Wine Glasses,These glasses seriously make good wine taste better. They do break more easily than others but they are worth it!!!
1,DON'T BUY FROM WINE GLASS GUYS,I order 2 sets of glasses and only have gotten 1 set. This is a month and 4 days after the order was placed and my credit card was fully charged.
4,Trap it at the source!,"Wood dust is not only an irritant; it's a health hazard. That's why I was thrilled to see this dust nozzle being offered after months of unavailability.This dust nozzle fits perfectly in the fixed and plunge bases of my RF1101 router kit, however it does require a mounting screw which was not provided with the nozzle nor with my router kit.Specs:The dust hose connection is just a hair bigger than 1 716"" OD and 1 9/32"" ID. The actual dust opening diameter around the bit is 2"" at the base and 1 9/16"" at the top, something to note if being used with a plunge base.I cannot attest to its effectiveness at this time, as I need to find an adapter to connect it to my shop vac hose. I however have confidence that it will significantly reduce the amount of fine dust flying around during my hand held routing tasks, and it should reduce the amount of plugging that occurs when routing mortises.4 out of 5 stars given due to missing mounting screw."
2,OOC,"The concept of the novel draws you in, as Sam and Al have leaped TOGETHER for once. Unfortunately, the novel hinges on little details and frankly, both Sam and Al (Especially Al) seem out of character (OOC). Sam and Al don't even get to talk to each other for the course of the entire book, until the very end. Read if you are a hard-core QL fan, but I'm going to bet this won't be your favorite by a long shot."
1,Awful.. One star if only for the Quantum Leap name,"The worst of the QL book series. Avoid unless you're a completist. Characterization is way off, Sam and Al seem to have gotten estrogen shots. Male characters written by a female author the way she thinks men are/act. (No worse than the completely off base writing of females by some male authors I guess, or the many times trite characteriztion of african american characters written by a white author) But still, a bad book. OVERLY descriptive to the point of ""who the ... cares what he's wearing or what the setting looks like anymore, just move the story along already!"""
3,It's Alright,"This tube is definetly big enough for one or two people, three would be pushing it unless they were all real small. I only had a chance to use it once but when the boat slowed down the nose of the tube goes into the water. Otherwise it seemed fine for the price."
3,"Great Tube, NOT a 3-Man","Great tube, easy to turn over in the water, easy to get onto in the water, and FAST when you add the Booster Ball. All of that being said, it is NOT a 3-man tube, unless the men you're talking about are less than 60 pounds each. We tried to fit three slim 13-15 year olds on the tube, and it was much to small. This is a great two person tube though."
3,Smaller than expected,"If you are looking for a 3 person tube, this is not the one. This tube is much smaller than a previous 3 person tube owned. Can only fit 2 teenagers on it at best. It seems to be well made and durable, but it is definitely not big enough for 3 people."
2,good for thoose who have the main men but....NO NAME!,"this toy is nice great evrything but a name this toy is great if u have all the main guys like shipwreck and stuff, but if this is your first gi joe toy that u wantthis is i deffiniteNO NO!"
5,Trimble Paints a Panorama of Images...,"... about Longs Peak.On the back cover of this book is a quote from Harold Dunning, 1930: ""To tell all that one can see from the top of Longs Peak would be telling too much, so you must climb it yourself..."" That is true. Yet even those who have climbed Longs Peak, or attempted to do so, love to read about it. To such people, this book was dedicated. Trimble writes with passion and understanding about a subject he obviously loves.Fortunately, he has a grasp of history, both the more recent kind as well as the sort that is written upon the rocks. He also provides an appendix on climbing ratings, notable Longs Peak firsts, and deaths on Longs Peak. For those who want to read more about the topics he touches upon, he provides an excellent bibliography at the back of his book."
3,I never got to read it since I already had one book out on my Kindle Fire with Amazon Prime.,"I really wanted to read this book, it is one I have looked forward to reading on the new Kindle Fire with Amazon Prime, too, that my children gave me for this past Christmas (2012). BUT, since, even WITH Amazon Prime, I was told by Amazon customer service that I am only allowed one FREE download book and ONE PER MONTH on the book from the LENDING LIBRARY per MONTH. I read Moby Dick in one sitting.Wish I could have read it. Sad that Amazon sold me and my children a bills of goods. So when I wanted to return the Kindle Fire, I found out that I would be charge a fee of 30 (thirty) PERCENT of the value of my Kindle Fire and forget about returning the leather cover. Not a chance of returning that leather cover."
3,ea sux,"This game is pretty fun , but it really goes away from the old best games. When Westwood(R.I.P) died , they took over , and they killed the games. generals and C&C3; suck compared to the godlike C&C95.; EA made crappy skins for the units , the gayest names , like ATTACK CYCLE. comeon.but this review only appeals to the old diehard C&C; players. all the new people who jumped in at generals or so dont know what thier talking about.review- EA really sucks , Westwood will always be the best company , its a fun game but the night i bought it , i played for about 30 min and went back to C&C95; , if you want real games get C&C; The First Decade"
3,Warning!!!,"Command & Conquer 3 is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played. For people familiar to the C&C; series, you will probably be pleased with the original interface and the return to GDI/NOD conflict.Here's the catch: This game is extremely poorly programmed! It WILL crash either during a game or on start-up, if it installs at all. I think the un-updated game that comes on the disc is OK, but the patches will kill it. It's your choice, don't update and sacrifice online multi-player, or update and be ready for lots and lots of crashes. As of this writing, EA knows about the problem and may or may not be working to fix it, but the problems haven't yet been fixed.The game looks great and is fairly easy to learn, it is such a shame that it is so crippled with bugs."
3,The Wrong product came never tried it,The seller did a nice job in resolving the issue mistakes happen totally understandable can't really comment on the game though so i gave 3 stars to indicate that I don't really know lol
1,Boring,"This book purpose is more to entertain than to make some deep impressions. What can I learn from a tribe which kills man when found in bed (jungle) with another woman, shrink heads of their enemies and similar. To me this book is more a commercialization of the Shuars then wisdom shearing. Maybe author is not in power to ask them real questions?If you want to read a good book on amazon shamans (Shuars and others) and Ayahuasca (vine of the spirits) then rather try 'Cosmic Serpent : DNA and the Origins of Knowledge' by Jeremy Narby."
2,Disappointing!,"I was very excited at first when I bought this book. It's full of nice illustrations and examples, but I was very disappointed when I finished reading it. It's very general with no structural orientation. It does not serve as a guide on how to design and develop your portfolio and just mentions general common knowledge which, as an architecture student or professional, you can learn throughout college and work.I would not recommend it for those who want to create a portfolio with strong impact."
1,Disappointing and Vague,"Just like another person's review, I was very excited about the book. After reading, I felt like I just wasted my time! The book is very generalized and NOT STEP BY STEP as it reads on the back cover. Half the book also dicusses the professional architectural culture in the UK(wasting my time!). It is a good book that inspires to have a good portfolio, but no help on how to make it!"
5,Love this book!!!,"This is a great story. The size is great for slipping in the diaper bag and taking it anywhere for a quick read. Also, the it is a board book so it is sturdy and will hold up to any 2 year old."
5,"Fun, creative book for kids of all ages.","We really enjoy the ""Stinky Face"" series of books. My only surprise was that it was a board book, but that's okay because I have a 2 and 7 year old. McCourt is so creative and if you don't have this book for Christmas, I'd suggest you get it."
1,An autobiography of self promotion,"The book read like an extremely long ad in the ""personals"" section of a newspaper. A self published autobiography of a self-absorbed woman indulging in an intimate tell all, filled with pictures of herself taken by friends."
2,"Watch out, this only accepts Bostich nails!","Be aware this nailer only accepts nail strips at a 25 degree angle! Most angled finish nailers use nail strips at a 15 degree angle. LOW and BEHOLD, Bostich is the only nails made like this!As for the unit itself, I bought one of these reconditioned units and it seams just fine. I don't give it anywhere near a heavy workload though.Also, I'm not sure about other nailers but this unit needs at least 110 pounds of pressure to drive the 2.5"" nails below the surface. Good to know if your compressor doesn't go that high.I berate this unit heavily for these two very important points not being mentioned in the description."
5,great nailer at a great price,"I bought this nail gun for set building, and it has fired a thousand nails so far with out fail. It arrived in its case with one small scratch on the yellow paint, the 5 different tips, a users manual, and a severely dented box of 1000 2"" nails. This is one of the better finishing nailers I have used, and being oil free makes it even better."
4,got it nailed,"The nailer arrived on time and better than advertised, in that the product info did not indicate that nails and nose piece were included, but they were. This was a pleasnt suprise. Product works as advertized. All in all a very good transaction, would buy from supplier again. Norm"
1,This product is misadvertised.,Amazon website stated that 1000 fasteners are included. The third party seller of the product disagrees.
4,great book!!,"I really enjoyed this book! I think it is a good overview of the life of Bruce Lee, although the title is a little misleading. I recommend Mr Miller's other book ""Tao of Muhammad Ali"". I also recommend reading James Bishop's ""Dynamic Becoming: Reflections on the Philosophical and Historical Legacy of Bruce Lee"", which includes a chapter on Davis Miller. He has some very interesting things to say."
2,not so good!,"I thought, the first part of the book about, his life and all, though boring, was well written..I thought, it interesting, about some of bruce lee's life experiences.. i just thought, that, the book, was alittle one sided, by using joe lewis, as a reference..he's really a bruce lee wannabe! His karate concepts are just copies of what bruce lee was saying years ago.. I thought, he sounded a little jealous! Then, towards the end there's a comparision, to muhammad ali against bruce lee.. Just stupid..Bruce Lee 145lb,at the most, to Ali' over 200lbs, in boxing.. Bruce lee was not a Boxer, he didn't train that way, that's not what he was..Boxer's have rounds to take out there opponent, streetfighting, you want to end it as quickly and simply as possible..Overall, the book, seemed to me, that this author wanted to try to rattle some cages, to sell books.."
5,Davis Miller: The Greatest Bruce Lee Writer Of All Times,"If you want to read just one book on Bruce Lee then make it ""The Tao Of Bruce Lee"". See my review of Miller's other book ""The Tao Of Muhammad Ali"" to learn more."
2,Still looking for an objective perspective on B.L.,"The Tao of Bruce Lee is anything but. The story is largely about the author who drew immense, life-changing inspiration from Bruce Lee's life and then, in the second half of the book, proceeds to nitpick about a variety of the man's flaws including how his jaw isn't optimally shaped for a fighter. I am looking for a book giving a critical perspective and truthful examination of Bruce Lee's life but this isn't it. I got the feeling that the author had a ""bone to pick"" or a ""chip on his shoulder"" about Bruce Lee. In fact the author seems to have some unresolved issues of his own, which is no surprise given the uncommonly painful childhood he endured.There was some good information in the book but I couldn't get over the feeling that the author had an agenda; to tear down the Bruce Lee legend. I would have appreciated a more objective perspective."
3,"Great book, but not for diehard Lee fans...","Now the book itself is a work of art. Miller's mix of his love for Lee and biography of Lee is an amazing concept. But as a Bruce Lee fan. I expected more of a focus on Lee himself. Although the story is very interesting, it made no sence to me why the wasn't more on Bruce Lee himself. But like I said, the book itslef is awesome. I hope you all have followed me this far!!!"
3,Title of book is misleading....,"The title of this book is misleading. Bruce Lee's story only comes in in the second half of the book. If you want to read about Bruce Lee, I would recommend 'Bruce Lee, Fighting Spirit' A Biography by Bruce Thomas (published in 1994). It's detailed, interesting and more insightful."
1,one star,"One star as I do not feel this book is worth reading at all if your interested in Bruce Lee. If you wish to know about Davis Miller, then fine, buy the book."
5,"interesting, refreshing read about Hollywood and celebrity","Highly recommended. A short book with tremendous range. I'm noticing a pattern in the customer reviews: Those who can read and write enjoy this book, those who can't, and are looking for a simple-minded Bruce Lee biography, often don't, even though the story Davis Miller tells in the first half of the book, his own, is probably that of a lot of Bruce Lee fans. Davis Miller has written an ambitious book. I found it because it was an editors' recommendation at ""The San Francisco Chronicle."" It is not something I would have come to, otherwise. I am grateful that I read the ""Chronicle"" review and I'm anxious to read more from this new, original writer."
5,a story for mature readers more than idolatrous Lee fans,"Astounding writing. Wonderful story. Gentle with Bruce Lee yet mature and rigorous. Not a book for kids but for grownups who care about good writing. It's tough and courageous to write such a fresh, powerful book about someone who has never been taken seriously before by a real writer. Hope that Tao of Bruce Lee can somehow find the smart, discerning readers it deserves. If you like Richard Ford and Tim O'Brien books, you won't go wrong with this complex yet simply rendered tale from Davis Miller."
4,not as good as Davis Miller's other books,"Strong reporting, original ideas, very good storytelling, but not as good as its companion volumes, The Tao of Muhammad Ali and The Zen of Muhammad Ali, both of which I regularly recommend to friends."
3,Mooney &#65533; Deviant Ways,"This thriller was decently written but there wasn't much original about it. The story is typical - serial killer terrorizes families, cop with demons of his own becomes obsessed with tracking him down. In other words, this is nothing new. If you're into the whole serial killer thriller genre, you might enjoy this but only if you've exhausted the better novels out there. Otherwise, skip it."
2,"Oh, please!","Bottom line: Chris Mooney can write.Top line: This book is beyond far-fetched; it's badly edited (on one page the hero, Jack Casey, is in a truck with the supposedly good guy, ubermensch/superman [but possibly bad] Malcolm Fletcher; farther down the page, Jack's in a Porsche; then in the next paragraph, he's in a truck. On another page, a cop throws away the same cigarette three different times--a trick I'd definitely like to learn.)Deviant Ways is repetitious, and hardly credible, with a villain who-when he is finally introduced-fails entirely to come to life. He's simply not real.The book is beyond derivative; it reads like an homage to Thomas Harris. And while Harris's books may _seem_ simple, it takes great skill to write as well as Harris does. Mr. Mooney is nowhere near that point. I do think that once he stops trying to ape other writers and begins to explore the scope of his own abilities, he may well write a book worth reading. But Deviant Ways isn't it."
5,Literary fiction at it's finest.,"Well, what can I say about Deviant Ways??? Words can't even describe my love, and passion for this book. Let me start off by explaining how much this book has impacted my life. From the first second I read this book, I immediately ran to the goodwill, and donated all of my clothing to the poor. Honestly, this book turns a deviant person into an uplifting United States citizen. This book has changed my life 360 degress around...NOW, since I just lost this book, I am waiting for a new copy to turn in. But, I am going through withdrawls because I NEED this book. I crave this book with all of its components. I am addicted! HELP ME PLEASE SEND ME THIS BOOK!!!! AAHHHHHHHHHHH"
3,A Pacy Thriller,"As thrillers go this book isn't bad at all. The story twists and turns and rapidly unfolds, which I liked. I also liked the fact that the killer, the `Sandman', was unique in his murder technique, his methods being reliant on technology and of a twisted nature. Of course, as with most thrillers, the Sandman had a dark history supplying him with motive, and the detective on the case, Jack Casey, has his own history of a wrecked family, an unhealthy relationship with killers, is struggling to keep his current relationship together, devotes too much of his life to his job, is unhappy, etc. But there is so much more to this story, including gruesome past cases and crooked FBI officials, that you can't help but like it. I would recommend it, but hope that you don't get as frustrated as I did with the typical detective problems that Jack Casey experiences!"
2,This Thriller Didn't Thrill Me!,"I'm glad Deviant Ways wasn't the first book by Chris Mooney that I read, or it probably would have been the last. Deviant Ways has an interesting, although not very original, plot and it does have its moments of excitement. However, the characters never came to life for me and I found I gave up on caring what happened to them. Further, the ""bad guy"" seriously lacked credibility. It came to a point that I found myself skimming through the last third of the book, and the only real thrill I got from Deviant Ways was when I came to its end. Do yourself a favor and skip this book, but do read Remembering Sarah by Mooney."
5,This one is definitely a thriller,"I just finished Deviant Ways by Chris Mooney. His first novel, it is a winner, a great book, very hardboiled, with elements that some may shy away from (nothing wrong with feeling that way) -- crimes against children and some fairly graphic descriptions of violence. Serial killers, FBI profilers, bombs, hair raising suspense. This one is a thriller and a good one. Highly recommend."
5,What a RUSH,"Mix Stephen King, Thomas Harris and James Patterson, and you get this unbelievable thriller by first time novelist Chris Mooney. Fantastic. You won't be disappointed."
3,So So,The book was alright for it being the author's first. There was too much emphasis on bombs and not really any mystery to the book. I think it would have been much better if we did not know the identity of the villian and had to guess who it was.
4,Instruments sing - Joni style,"Finely crafted arrangements from David Lahm have Joni Mitchell singing with the instrumental voices of top NY musicians, adding another perspective for Joni fans, and some great solo work in a different setting from Lew Tabackin and Randy Brecker for jazz fans. A respectful nod passing from one creative head to another, produces novel enjoyment for all listeners. Joni's spirit arises so uncannily from these tracks that I found myself doing a double take from time to time. I enjoyed the experience."
5,Great movie!,"I love Sherlock Holmes, I love case closed; the combination is perfection in DVD format."
2,Black Flat Worms,"I am lucky enough to have a family of Chipmunks,a Bluejay,2-crows,and many other small animals, trust me enough, to let me, hand feed them. I buy 50lbs of peanuts every year. This particular bag, had many shells with 4 very small nuts inside. Also, inside about half of the shells are flat black worms, and nuts that look like they are covered in sawdust. I can not recommend buying from this company based on a comparison of other 50lb bags of peanuts that I have purchased in the past."
4,"a great gift , a real treat.","It is a delightful little book (and I mean tiny lil book) that I choose to carry in my purse. I find myself reading a couple of pages of it whenever I feel the need to boost my spirit, and bring me back to the real world with a healthier attitude. 4 or 5 short lines of wise words on each page are like little tickles though a hectic day."
4,One of the all time Dance music classics,"All throughout the clubbing communities of the world this is almost the national anthem. Not only is it good, but it's very bloody good Top banana!"
3,nice ... but a bit bulky,"I purchsed this watch as I needed a ""knock around"" watch that I could wear around the house. The casing is a bit thick - 1/2"" yes 1/2"" think... so its kind of bulky and hard to close your dress shirts. The display is great - big numbers and luminous (not sure if they always lite up at nite). The braclet is a mat (dull) finish which I couldn't tell from the pictures on-line. Overall, a good watch... but dont' think I would recommend purchasing jewelry on-line unless you have seen it before."
3,Title is misleading,"This is not a workbook in any sense, but a guide for instructors with suggested questions and answers. I will be reading reviews before buying anything else based on the product description!"
2,No redeeming values,"Bought this book a couple of years ago and finally got around to reading. I did not like it. Found that the main character was difficult to feel anything towards, the foray into Amsterdam's redlight district not understandably connected to the storyline and the story overall seemed disjointed. I kept hoping that the book would straighten out, that the characters would be believable and likeable but there was nothing important, worthwhile about this book. in my estimation one of Irving's worst."
1,1 star is still too much,I could say many things about this monument to Dullness. But I would waste even more time than I already did trying to get to any interesting passage. I surrendered in the middle of the book.Don't be as stupid as me. Run away from this piece of nothing.
5,A WRITER FOR ALL TIME,"The prose of John Irving seems to flow as effortlessly from his brain to the page, as his blood flows through his veins. It is articulate; witty; brazen; reflective; sharp; explicatory and perfectly readable.The saga of Ruth, Ted, Marion and Eddie sweeps across the pages like blustering wind at times, and like a gentle breeze at others. The characters are so entrenched in the reader's psyche, they elevate to close friends early in. What occurs in their day by day struggles becomes essential fodder for the reader's ever increasing interest. The prose is written lyrically, the descriptions keen, and sex scenes richy erotic; the characters are defined intimately defying complacency.To say John Iriving is genius is to say black is dark........he is beyond description. The man writes a story that lives within the reader's soul for seasons. John Irving is a master craftsman."
1,long-winded and annoying,"It starts with a titillating beginning but meanders through a plot and characters that defy reason and reality. Intelligent, educated people don't discourse with the f-word as their favorite adjective. Nor do women friends call one another ""baby"" all the time. The ending was predictable. The character were losers. It was annoying, and I wouldn't have wasted my time had it not been a book club book. One can easily skim, since Irving is so verbose, without missing anything."
1,Disappointed,"I thought the first third of the book was outstanding. Irving's writing style used here - going back and forward in time - was just beautiful. Then Marion left and the story went haywire. I could never figure out the relationship between Ruth and her father ... it seemed sort of perverse yet there was no explanation as to why that was so. The Amsterdam subplot was ricidulous and I ended up just skipping through those pages, hoping for a good ending. That never ended up happening as all of the characters were pretty much one-dimensional, and I didn't like any of them anyway."
3,Main character never grew on me...,"What bothered me most was that Ruth, the main character, never grew on me. Marion did, so did Eddie to a lesser extent (I didn't like Allan) but I could neither like nor dislike Ruth - she simply was who she was.Ruth was like a person in your life who you see often, know very well, but never think about. Like Eddie, I guess I ""never got over Marion"" enough to enjoy the less interesting character of Ruth.I don't know how else to explain it."
1,The Slide Continues,"After going to India with A Son of The Circus, John Irving attempted to return to his madcap, sexual roots with A Widow For One Year. Unfortunately, he has apparently mined this turf so well that he no longer has anything to add. A Widow For One Year is as exciting as watching a checkers game between two contestants who have no desire to win. Ruth is a dismally flat character, as is her father, who should have been more exciting given that he was portrayed as a womanizing geriatric. Hopefully Irving will soon tire of the Dickens length novels he's been writing for so long, and attempt some slimmer works, as Widow could easily have lost two or three hundred pages and been a stronger novel."
2,The widow according to Irving.,"I had such high hopes for this book as I'm an Irving fan, but the characters were so flat and the pages just drag on. I've not had the experience of being in love with the same absent person for 40 years but it makes for very dry reading, I must say. I agree with the other reviews that the first part grabbed me but then it just fell apart. The Hannah character was just plain irritating.I got about 60 pages from the end and I just didn't care what happened anymore."
2,bla bla bla,I am an avid reader of John Irving's Work...and Garp was not my first sojourn into his world... it was Cider House. I picked up Widow expecting another reallygreat story..and was really intrigued by Ruth as a child...as one other reviewer pointed out... but the rest of the book is sadly lacking in any kind of substance whatsoever. I read the book waiting for Marion to come to her senses.. and had to wait until the very end to find out and was only given about 3 sentences... And yes.. I did notice an inordiante amount if italicizing... and how about the titles of Ruth's last book. My Last Bad Boyfriend... I don't know.. the whole thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Hannah makes me ill...Eddie is just plain pathetic...only Harry resmbles anything close to an Irving character. This book lacks the warmth and humor that carrys Iriving's signature tragedy to a place of learning and growth.
3,"It's no ""Cider House""","One is entitled to expect a great deal from Irving after reading all of his published works. ""Widow"" doesn't measure up in many respects, but a mediocre Irving novel is still much better than most new fiction on the market today. An interesting story, but without the depth of earlier works. Irving's autobiographical tendencies were a bit misplaced here -- sure he's lived the life of a writer, but, as far as I can tell, not the life of a woman. The breast references were silly (I don't recall ever learning the size of Dr. Larch's genitalia, for example.) The relationship between Ruth and Hannah, as well as the voice of each woman as an individual, just did not ring true (this is based on my own 35 years of life as a woman.) And Marion simply wasn't developed enough to make a judgment. I will continue to read whatever Irving publishes, but this is not his best work."
4,"Wonderful, yet not quite Garp or Cider House","As with typical Iriving, Widow starts of a little slow, and ends possibly a little week, but the middle is fantastic. The story is classic John Irving in that it pushes the limits of plausability, but does not cross the line of pretentiousness that Owen Meany does or just plain ridiculousness that circus crosses. It is much closer to the excellence of both Garp and Cider House. Its true strength lies in its characters and the development of our true interest and concern for them. A Widow For One Year is a return to John Irvings best works."
2,Few bright moments in a dull book,"I can't imagine how people who had a hard time with ""Son of the Circus"" (which was one of Irvings best) could love this book. I'm amazed that Irving could write anything this bad. Had it not been an Irving Novel I could not have forced myself, as I did, to finish it."
1,Not up to Irving standards,"""Widow"" was nothing like his other novels. I am a big Irving fan and miss his Owen Meany-type novels. Reading this book was a total waste of my time. Unfortunately, I will think twice before buying another Irving book."
3,"Funny scenes, but contrived coincidences diminish effect.","John Irving is as wonderful as ever at creating colorful characters and laugh-out-loud funny scenes, but in this book his use of coincidence takes away from the humor. In addition, at times I felt that the characters were out of character. At the end of the first section, Eddie was finding a voice and becoming more assertive. It seemed pointless to describe that development considering the kind of man he became during the final two sections of the book. It was a fine book; I think I just expected more."
4,Widow is the Best of Irving,"I have personally only been a modest Irving fan in the past. I find some of his previous work just hard to read and enjoy. However, I loved Widow. I picked it up and could not put it down. The story of Ruth Cole and the lives of those around her fascinated me. I was also fascinated by her father and the role of women in his life and how that affected the other characters int he book. There was so much here worth reading and discussing that I look forward to finding a book club talking about the book."
3,Better than Son of the Circus. Short of Owen Meany,"After the debacle that Son of the Circus was , I worried that my favorite American author had lost it. WIdow is a nice recovery but falls short of his best efforts in Hotel New Hampshire and Owen meany. Irving teaches us little new about the human condition and fraility that epitomize his best work. The story is well constructed but at times way too predictable. Still it was a nice tale, although his characters are beginning to look more and more alike. Marion would have fit into Garp, Cider House, or Hotel NH. Eddy could have gone to school with Garp. Ruth could fit any of the books. I guess my main disappointment is the lack of uniquenes in the story and characters. Then again my disaapointment in Son of the Circus was that they were a bit too unique. There' a fine line between success and failure. I think Irving succeeds here but I'm hoping for better next time. At four years per novel, my expectations are high."
3,Irving back on the rise.,"After the somewhat disappointing A Son Of The Circus, the latest novel by Irving was definitely a leap forward, albeit not a giant one. A Widow For One Year certainly is a compelling story that drags you in once you start reading it but it is far less moving than some of his previous novels. It lacks the tear-jerking qualities of Garp and Owen Meany, it is far less touching than The Ciderhouse Rules or The Hotel New Hampshire. Although I got to like the characters I did not miss them like I missed Garp or Owen Meany once I read the last page of their story. In his latest novel Irving put a certain amount of distance between his characters and the readers, making the former into mere acquaintances instead of lifelong friends I find that a pity and the sole weakness of an otherwise excellent piece of work."
3,In which John Irving loses his way,"The only breathing author who can approach Dickens in the craft/art of the novel, Irving starts with a bang and then seems to lose his way. Summer 1958 (both characters and plot) is far more interesting than the two 1990s sections. I believe it's the odd structure of the novel that drags it down. Coincidence can be useful (in Irving's capable hands, it's often magical), but there was just too, too much here. Every main character had read all the other character's mediocre novels, even half way around the world? Is getting a string of mediocre novels published really that easy? It must seem so to someone of Irving's talents, but trust me: it ain't. So-so Irving is better than most any other author's best, but in his latest book, the beginning ranks with his best and by the end, much of what makes a great read seems to have careened woefully askew."
2,wandering story whose characters lack substance and interest,"I found the book tedious and almost defensive in its insistence that the novelist is a misunderstood creature. If that is part of his content, I found little to convince me that I should make the effort to understand. I found the characters neither not rich or memorable. The feeling I got was that he had the pieces of three unfinished novels written and decided to publish them without even reading the proofs."
2,Disappointed,"I have loved all of John Irving's other books. I was excited to read this one, but I was quite disappointed. The storytelling and the plot are usual Irving style, but Ruth's (the main character) relationship with Hannah as well her lovers are surprisingly superficial and unbelievable. Irving's usual ironic humor is missing, and there doesn't seem to be anything taking it's place."
3,Good book but could drag.,I liked this book but it had a tendency to drag on and on. I tried to quit reading it several times and even read a different book entirely before completely finishing this one. I do like the intracies of the characters.
4,"Don't give up, readers. Ending is truely Irving.","I almost gave up in the middle, but I am glad I didn't. This is a great love story. The ending is truely Irving. However, unlike Garp, this novel lacks his detatched, sarcasm on the world. Garp made me realize how crazy and unpredictable can this life can be, but this book is more about human emotions. I was hoping to share Irving's view on cometemporary America. I miss that very much. The point is: there should be more than Diet Coke to illustrate America in 1990's!"
5,I love this novel.,"I've just finished reading this. I really love this novel. I loved ""Garp"" and this novel reminds me of ""Garp"". I am attracted by the pecuriar world created by him. While reading, I felt I was one of the residents of his world. I was very eager to know what would happen next, and at the same time I wanted to go on reading forever wishing it wouldn't end. This is comical, though it has some tragic incidents in it. After reading, I felt life is worth living; with my beloved family. Anyway this is a bargain because you can enjoy various sorts of reading such as a children's story, a detective story and a love story. I'm looking forward to his next novel."
3,Not his best work,"This book is just OK. I didn't think it was as good as Owen or Hotel NH or Cider House. Different type of book where the lead character, Ruth Cole, is not in more than half of the book. I liked Eddie O'Hare, he was the one person who kept me interested in finishing, even though the ending was much too easy to figure out. The first third of the book was funny, but then it got pretty boring. Still a must read for all John Irving fans, but if you're not hooked on Irving - borrow this one from the library and save your money."
3,not his best but not bad,"okay. this is not ""a prayer for owen meany"" but what is? this is not ""the world according to garp"" but not many books are either. what this is is another example of john irving being the pre-eminent author of our time. there are some problems. unlike the aforementioned books, this reeally doesn't have much of an interesting plot. it's hard to care for the characters. but the words are so perfect. what's interesting is that he basically flat out tells you what's going to happen, and then you are shocked when it does. most authors wouldn't have been able to manufacture this plot into an purely enjoyable reading experience."
3,"Good, but not Irving's Best","Sorry to say this is not one of John Irving's better novels. But then again, how could anything top ""The Cider House Rules"" and ""A Prayer for Owen Meany?"" This one was just a little too slow moving for me though, although I enjoyed the happy ending. Plus, I knew Mr. Irving was a little sex-obsessed, but this book crosses the line! Next time I read I'm going to make a note of how many usages of the word ""breast"" I find."
2,"Contrived plot, no characters to identify with,","I have enjoyed John Irving since he wrote Garp. Some books failed to live up to that quality, but this one hits the bottom. The plot is too contrived, rediculous ending and although I love Irving's Dickens like characters and humor they are missing here. Only the pictures of the dead boys live up to Irving's usual inventive twists. His writing is fluid so I enjoyed the book for a while although I thought the premise of a woman who had just lost her two sons would bed a boy of the same age who looks like her son. Typically a man's idea! And why would Ruth and Hannah be friends, but then we don't really know any of these people who care about what happens to them."
2,Overly ambitious plot with underdeveloped character,"The ambitious plot to span three different stages of a writer's development in a humourous and engaging way could have worked. Unfortunately, Irving's style of writing and farcical story led to a meandering of waffle during the reading of which this reader managed to complete 2 other far more engaging books. It was impossible to empathise with any of Irving's characters and each chapter left a who cares feeling in this reader's head. Very disappointing, but I know a lot of people who loved it."
3,Longer is not necessarily more endearing.,"I have been an Irving fan since Garp and have been increasingly disappointed since Cider House Rules. In particular, Owen Meany SHOUTED throughout the book (whereas Simon Birch never did so), I put the Circus down halfway through it. Despite its length, the 537 pages could not really encompass the entire story which was more unwieldy than phantasmagoric. None of the characters appealed to me; most irritating was the overuse of italics, a gimmick which was reminiscent of Owen Meany's capitalized speech. Bring back the bears."
2,A major disappointment from one of my favourite authors.,"Although this book starts off quite promisingly and quite thrillingly I found it quickly descended into a contrived and finally uninteresting story. The plot twists were unbelievable and the characters motivations were, at times, ridiculous. Unfortunately, after the last two superb books: A Prayer for Owen Meany and A Son of the Circus, this was a major disappointment."
5,One of Those Books That You Don't Want to Finish!,"I've been an avid fan of John Irving since first reading The World According To Garp. This new book is by far my favorite since Garp. Irving is a master at making human tragedy the center of his characters lives. Reminiscent of Garp, a tragic car accident features prominently in the story. My only main fault with the novel was that Irving doesn't often write from a woman's point of view, and although his Ruth character was multi-layered, his obsession with her breasts was unrealistic. The novel was all the more interesting because all of it's main characters were writers. Getting to read the character's work added only added to the novel."
1,What a dissappointment,"Long ago I read The Hotel New Hampshire and fell in love with Irving's superior storytelling. I looked forward to each new novel, and treated myself to A Widow as soon as it came out. I had planned to attend a reading in Boston, but was not able to make it. Lucky for me! Irving refused to sign books. That certainly explains a lot, in my opinion. I hope Mr. Irving comes back to us soon and replaces this pompous imposter."
1,Disappointing,"Major word for this book is boring. Characters are unbelievable, story line predictable and slow. Unfortunately I allow myself the luxury of a novel during my vacation and I'm disappointed to say I picked this one."
1,A Widow for One Year,"This has to be the most boring novel I have read. In fact, once I put it down, I found that it is virtually impossible to pick it up again. However, since I bought the book, I picked it up again, at about page 106, only to put it down again at page 232. I doubt if I'll ever start again. The book stinks."
3,Good story but overrated novel by an irritating writer.,"After reading many glowing reviews I was eager to pick up Irving's latest. But I'm disappointed: John Irving is a good storyteller, yes, but as a writer he leaves much to be desired. What is it with all his italics? He uses so many italics it became irritating in the first chaper. It's like he doesn't trust his readers to know which words should be emphasized. Each page would average five words in italics. Am I the only one irritated by this? And by Irving's inevitable obsession with breasts; I find it tiresome and yes, infantile. Despite all that, his book stays with me because of the finely drawn characters: Ruth Cole is a believable heroine, and her mother, Marion, is truly tragic. The ending is poignant.I'll pass this book along to family, but with reservations."
2,A disappointment,"I love John Irving. He is a funny, quirky and captivating writer who often hits me right in the centre of my heart.That's the problem with this book. Its as if he is TRYING to be quirky, that he knows that is his hallmark. Instead, his characters come of seeming flawed or pathetic. The book started out where a tragedy is announced and I was immediately pulled into the novel and ready for some heartwrenching times.Instead, as the book progressed, I had trouble reading it becuase it seemed like he was just trying to hard or something.If you read Prayer for Owen Meany, then Son of the Circus, then you read this book, you are in for a big disappointment."
4,I Love Irving,"Even the 158 lbs Marriage. This is my third Irving read/listen. I've shared the many touching moments with Garp, Homer, the spouse swapping 4-some and now Ruth. I love the way John Irving draws you in and then brings you to tears or belly laughter. I am always moved to identify and sympathize with the many characters of his books. They all have their own very special way of touching me. This Irving story is no exception. No book is flawless. Some works are not intended to be analyzed or evaluated for an all encompassing message or moral. With Irving I've always felt it's the ride not the destination that is the pay-off. Would highly recommend this book to women especially."
4,Not his best but ...,"... up there among them.'A Widow for One Year' is not as good as 'Cider House' but better then 'Son of The Circus'.The characters are, as always in novels by Irving, strong and 'believable', and the humor is very enjoyable.We also get the good mix of happiness and disaster, characterized by Irving"
1,Please don't bother with this one,"""A Widow for One Year"" was my first John Irving book, and it might be my last. While I thought the plot was interesting (at first), it quickly went downhill from there. Irving cluttered up the novel with extempraneous details and subplots that did nothing to help me to the end. If anything, they were deterrents along the way. I didn't love, or even like, any of the characters. And Hannah was a nightmareÑI found myself wondering why Ruth (or anyone) would ever be friends with her. It was such an effort to finish the book that I vow never to force myself to read such drivel again. The only thing that I looked forward to in this book was finishing it so I could start a new oneÑby a different author.But, I hear ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"" is well worth the read. However, the next Irving book I pick up will be from the library, as I can't bear to spend more money on anything that has the slightest chance of being so mundane."
2,This confirms my belief why I don't read John Irving,"I don't know why I have struggled through this 5oo plus page book. Probably because I paid $16.oo for it! The main traits of the characters are continueously repeated. How many times does Irving have to mention Ruth's large right arm and breasts, and Eddie's penchant for old women, and Hannah's constant use of ""baby"" and ""f******"". Isn't there more to these people then this? I was most disappointed when Irving related the first chapter of one of Ruth's books. Did anyone notice that the voice of the author never changed? Are we to believe that Ruth writes and sounds exactly like Irving? At least he could have varied his voice to make it seem that this particular chapter was indeed written by someone else. My favorite scene was when Ruth beat her ""last bad boyfriend"" with his squash racquet. This showed imagination and wit - which a majority of this story seems to lack. END"
4,"A very detailed, interesting and involved novel.","I have NEVER read any of Irving's novels or a five hundred page novel !! However...I have never become so involved in a story as I did with Ruth's life. I like the way Irving presented this novel, with short sub-chapters, it flowed nicely. He is certainly a very talented author and I have never read a book in which so much was going on at the same time and it all intertwined. I was disappointed in the ending....I was expecting more from the reappearance of Marion..it seemed like he should have spent a little more time on the encounter with Ruth at least. I also thought that it was very coincidental that Harry happened to be so interested in an old murder case...so much as to pursue finding the key witness, and the fact that he was Ruth's number one book fan....hard to believe. Overall I was quite impressed with his work...and I am now reading The World According to Garp !! Thanks"
1,"John Irving, what happened?","I picked up A Widow for One Year, anticipating another great read by Mr. Irving, who's earlier works, The World According to Garp and Owen Meany, were favorites of mine. Instead, I've found a poorly conceived, puerile, rambling excuse for a novel - seems like a throwaway effort by a truly talented contemporary author. Loaded with badly developed caricatures of characters spouting infantile dialogue, droning in-your-face narrative, in which every subplot line is literally beaten to death by relentless repetition, I've been shocked into a mode where I just can't put this book down - I'm waiting for Mr. Irving's joke to end, waiting for a complete turnaround in style and substance - and if it doesn't come (don't think it will) I'll be more than confused that the reviewers actually liked this feeble attempt. Mr. Irving, what have you done?"
4,"Twisted. Very, very twisted.","I read ""Garp"" when I was 13 years old and have been an avid John Irving fan since then.""A Widow For One Year"" is an interesting mix of characters: A family who is nostalgic for two boys long dead before the main character (the four year old sister of the two boys) is born, and a young man who was hired to be an assistant to the father of the main character but specifically chosen to be seduced by his wife (the mother of the main character). The young man gains a lifelong friend (the main character) and a lifelong infatuation with older women.The story is separated into three parts, but the first part is the best - it is arguably some of John Irvings best work. Parts two and three finish the story, but don't have the impact of the compellingly twisted nature of part one."
4,Wonderful character development.,"John Irving is one of my favorite American novelists. In ""A Widow for One Year"" he again delivers a book full of quirky, but very human and believable characters within a good story."
3,Almost as good as Owen Meany,"Had everything together for a great novel, however, once Ruth gets to Germany, Irving loses me. Being a romantic, I loved the ending, but wished for more of the same in the middle of the book."
3,"Delivered, but just","The first words I heard about Widow went something like ""the best Irving has written yet."" Perhaps then the bar was simply set so high that the novel couldn't live up to the hype. I remember very particular details of Owen Meany, Garp or Cider House even after six, ten or twenty years. There are few details I can recall of Widow without straining myself, and I just completed it two months ago.The beauty of the book, as in all Irving's work, is primarily in the writing. His plots are so tight, so crafted, while still including the most bizarre of twists. His capacity to bring characters together from the most distant reaches of the plot never ceases to amaze me, and Irving is always able to ""wrap things up"" to a point of leaving one satisfied. He does this masterfully in Widow, and that, more than the story itself, is what warrants it my three stars."
1,A widow for one year - a waste of one month,"When people ask me whose books I enjoy reading, the name John Irving is always first off my lips. Ever since a friend in college recommended ""Garp,"" I have been hooked by his engaging style and fascinating stories. Until now. This book bored me to tears. I did not care in the least for Ruth Cole, the main focus of the book, or any of the other drab people we meet along this sad journey. If this is the only John Irving book you have read and you didn't like it - don't do yourself a disservice - please buy and savor his previous fine novels. I will be first in line for his next tome, but as for this one, it is a sad disappointment. Sorry, John."
2,The first and last Irving book I will read.,"Unfortunately, I have no desire to read another John Irving novel. If this is a good example of his other novels, you won't catch me reading any more of his work. It was a chore just to finish the darn book."
4,GREAT NARRATOR MAKES THIS A GOOD CHOICE FOR BOOKS ON TAPE,"John Irving is twisted, perverted, and America's Best Living Novelist.This book is of particular interest to NOVELISTS -- All the main characters in this book are novelists, so Irving is a bit self-indulgent in describing the characters' process of writing novels.There are so many reviews of the hardcover, i'll just say that i've listened to numerous books on tape and this Guidall feller is by far the best narrator i've heard.I definitely felt engaged it the story, which is what it's all about for me. But I wouldn't put it on my ""favorite books"" list for which I would reserve the five star rating."
1,Very disappointed,This book is almost pornographic in describing it s many dysfunctional relationships. There is very little else to the story besides a tragedy in a family that creates dysfunction between the characters and how they display their twisted emotions through their sexuality. It dragged on and on about the same porblems until it finally ended the exact way I thought it would end.
2,I hope to finish this someday...,"I overheard someone saying they were late for a dinner because they could not tear temselves away from this book. I have been working my way thorugh this for three weeks now, and am only 2/3 of the way (I usually read at least one book a week). Granted, it is long. TOO long. I just cannot bring myself to care about the characters, or Ruth's breasts. I want to give up, but feel like I may be just getting to the good part - sort of like with ""She's Come Undone""."
2,Sadly disappointing...........,"I was recommended this book by a close friend, who is an avid reader of ""titillating"" books, and she mentioned that this one had a definite erotic edge. Well, it definitely struck out on this and many other levels and toward the end, simply finishing it seemed like a chore. It was a mildly interesting story at best. The only parts of the book that could really count as any form of erotic idea at all were a teenager masturbating with his fantasy woman's sweater. An unfortunate offering from a gifted author."
5,Simply a great book!,"This is the first John Irving book I've read, and it blew me away. I've since gotten hooked on him as a writer. Honestly, I think it's the best book he's written. The Hotel New Hampshire and Cider House Rules were very good though. I'm reading The World According to Garp now! Great writer!"
2,not compelling,"I found that I could not sympathize with these characters. Most of them were simply not likeable. It was a really annoying read--overuse of foreshadowing, predictable flat characters, and not very believeable. And the word ""irony"" was misused more than once! Nothing good really happened in the book. I wanted to shout out ""Get some counseling!"" to each one of the characters."
2,"Same old, Same old...","I've finished A Widow for One Year and like some of his books, there is the same tired cast of characters. There is always an author, someone who likes track or running, and visits overseas, usually Germany of Denmark, with prostitutes and with street names that are unpronounceable. ""On the Molensteeg,and in the area of the old church on the Oudekerksplein..."" ""This time the prostitutes on the Korsjespoortsteeg..."" When you run into words like that more than once it gets annoying. Thankfully, there were no bears in this one."
4,Answering the question of Ted's suicide.,"This is in answer to the reader who ""didn't get it"" referring to Ted Cole's committing suicide after his daughter caught him bedding her best friend. Ruth trapped her father behind the wheel of his own car (remember the rules of not looking at the passenger while behind the wheel) and told him the story of how she'd bedded his squash partner and how he'd beaten her up. Ted is furious, of course, but Ruth says he can still play squash with the man, because it doesn't matter what happened. She goes on to say that Ted is still her father and Hannah is still her best friend, so none of it matters. What became apparent to me, at this point, was that Ted Cole's past justifications for bedding married women suddenly didn't work anymore. He realized, for once in his life, he was wrong about something big."
1,A disappointing book with unlikable characters,"By far one of the most nonsensical books I have ever read. The characters, while intensely detailed, are unrealistic and entirely unlikable. Ruth is an angry, convoluded woman who is only interesting as a child. Her relationship with Hannah is only slightly more unrealistic than the far-fetched love affair between Eddie and Marion. That we are to believe the ""love"" between a 16 year-old boy and a 39 year-old woman survived a 37 year estrangement is ridiculous. The only hihglight of the book is the tragic story of the two boys' accident. However, beginning Eddie and Marion's sexual encounters with Eddie's physical resemblence to Marion's dead sons is disturbingly unnecessary."
1,Dull and lifeless after the first 100 pages,"Mr. Irving starts off strong, with interesting well drawn characters. However, after the first section, there is nothing that's either interesting, compelling or particularly well written. It's my guess that Mr. Irving started a pretty good novel and either to explain or excuse his purient interest in prostitutes, tried to steer his good opening into a trite story about and unlikeable writer and her purient interest in prostitutes. I guess if nothing else, this book helped Mr. Irving explain to his wife and the IRS why he needed to hang out in Amsterdam's red light district."
4,"Entertaining, but...","While this 500-page novel was entertaining I did not walk away from it with the same energy from when I started it. The majority of the novel was not only entertaining, but very original. Towards the ending it became very cliche. Almost like Irving took the easy way out. He built up these characters and did not seem to know what to do with them at the end. The ending changed the book so drastically for me that I could not enjoy it as much as I had. What was the point?"
1,Not John Irving's best work by a long shot.........,"Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I really disliked this book. The first half was terrific, but the second half seemed rushed and pointless to me. I only wish the book had continued the storyline concerning Marion Cole, rather than Ruth. Once Ruth gets to Amsterdam you might as well turn to the last two chapters, since that's as good as it gets. I did like the last paragraph........."
2,It just went on and on and on...,"I started this book with such high hopes. Unfortunately, what a bore! It took all of my strengths to muddle through to the end. I wish I would have given up earlier and not wasted my time. Parts of the story were intriguing, but overall a dud! I am not recommending this book to anyone that I know."
1,I left it at jury duty.,"First I'm hooked by good writing, then by a profound storyline, this book had neither. I first attempted to read it while lying comfortably in bed, didn't work. Well we all know how boring jury duty is. I figured that while waiting to grace a panel of fine jurors, it will hold my interest. The book is just plain boring and left me asking the question, why? I threw it on the table with the rest of the magazines and opted to read ""The Great Gatsby"" for a second time. They just don't make books like that anymore."
1,A story in need of an editor.,"I regret enriching the author by one penny in having purchased this book. After a splendid set-up, the reader chases the dream that the little girl will ever be reunited with her Mother. Personally I coudn't care less about Eddie and his sixty times. I'm sick of all the ""breast"" references. Did Irving have a bet with someone about how many times he could illustrate a breast fixation? Somewhere in this book lies a good, maybe a great! short story. The ham-handed coupling of Ted's children's books with Ruth's eventual life ( Amsterdam and the Moleman for instance) seemed amateur. I'm disgusted with the success of this book, but it reveals much about the free time available to many Americans."
4,Irving still knows how to push those emotional buttons,"After reading The World According to Garp, one of my favorite books of all time, I read all of Irving's prior work. By the time I had finished I felt that I had heard enough about bears, wrestling and infidelity to last a lifetime, so haven't been inclined to read another of his books until recently opening A Widow For One Year. I have to say, he still has the talent for making the bizarre seem believable and for tugging at a range of emotions - frequently all at once, so that one doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. For anyone who likes the Irving formula, this should be a truely satisfying book. I enjoyed it much more than I expected to - even when I realized that my emotions were being manipulated."
1,A very disappointing book and a tedious read.,"This book is over-long and sloppily written. There are far too many parenthetical explanations of extraneous material or observations already made plain to the reader, distracting from what might otherwise have been great scenes, some of which could have made excellent short stories. I was disappointed -- only great determination kept me reading to the end. Sorry, John. Maybe I missed the point. Were you trying to write a pornographic soap opera, or what?"
2,Read GARP instead.,"Too many things in John Irving's latest novel are painfully repetitive, for instance...when Marion leaves her family earlier in the novel, the author even wrote at that part that Marion will come back thirty-some years later. As a reader, I'd rather to find that out for myself later in the novel when Marion actually returns. But the author spoiled that by revealing everything too early in the novel and knowing that Marion will return, I didn't have the chance to feel the actual loss of her. The author explains everything too early and then repeat them again and again throughout the novel. Simply a bore."
3,"Skilled, compelling, baffling...","After reading the first few chapters of A Widow For One Year, I was madly recommending it to my friends. After digging into the second section of the novel, I'd begun to doubt whether my friends would actually enjoy this. Having completed the novel today, I have mixed feelings. A glorious start, a touching conclusion--sandwiched around an Amsterdam-focused central section that nearly brings one's interest in the book's main characters to a crunching halt. I must admit that it was all interesting, but it sure doesn't rate with some of his better novels (I'm not just talking World According to Garp here...this isn't as great a novel as The Cider House Rules). Now I hope my less literary friends who pick this up don't think I'm some kind of a weirdo..."
4,Compelling,"I was thoroughly engrossed in this novel from start to finish. After having been bored by rehashes such as The 168-Pound Marriage, The Hotel New Hampshire, and The Son of Circus, A Widow For One Year was a refreshing return to the brilliance Irving demonstrates in Garp and A Prayer for Owen Meany. The character of Marion, although not present for a significant portion of the book, was most compelling. Her spectre haunts the novel with sadness and loss. Although the novel was at times self-indulgent (Parts II & III could be shaved down a bit), fans of Irving will come to expect and forgive him for his characteristic wanderings. His ability to draw startling real characters and depict the absurdities of everyday life is in full force in A Widow for One Year."
3,"Just not up to ""Irving"" par","Perhaps it's because ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"" was one of the best books I've ever read; perhaps it's because I was expecting more. But whatever the reason, I felt a little cheated by this newest book of Irving's. I kept feeling as if when John Irving was writing the book, he was thinking, ""Gosh, I am so brilliant..."" From any other writer, ""A Widow For One Year"" would be an achievement, but for Irving, it was a step down."
3,typical irving,"I've read most of Irving's works and have grown to appreciate his keen insight of the folly and quirkiness of sex and love -- but please, 8,312 references to breasts? Maybe he had a purpose (please, someone, tell me I just ""don't get it""), but I didn't see it among the other heavy-handed messages he was able to convey. As for Ruth, she held no appeal for me or the other women I know who read the book. I hope the author does some more homework before he attempts another main female character. OK, so I liked it, and I know what I'm getting into every time I pick up an Irving book."
4,Irving still reigns,"Irving never ceases to amaze me with his ability to tell stories. In WIDOW FOR ONE YEAR, Irving shows his highest talent (charecter developement) and takes it to the highest level. I have never been let down by a John Irving novel."
4,Loved it! Great summer reading!,My first experience with John Irving works. I'll definitly be reading more of his books. This one left me with breath-taking images I will never forget.
2,I'm BORED!,"This is the first book I have read in a long time that I question whether I want to finish it or not??? I don't think I get it. Is John Irving redundant or what?? I wanted a story, but I keep getting the feeling that he is just trying to give us filler..... in the words of Shirley McLaine ""blah,blah,blah"""
3,"Enjoyable, but a bit heavy on descriptions of breasts","I had very mixed feelings while reading this book...at times I couldn't put it down, and during some repetitive segments, I couldn't wait to start reading something else. The continued references to breast shapes and sizes was tiresome. Dispite this all, I am passing my copy on to friends and family, mainly because I enjoyed the first quarter and second half of the book, and found the story and the conclusion very satisfying."
1,"Wordy, colourless, and lacking in direction.","I was so excited to hear that Irving was coming out with a new novel, that I couldn't wait to read it. I can't begin to describe my disappointment in this stupid story. Not only were the long, rambling narratives unrelated to what I'd thought was the main plot, but the timing was 'off' in some of the key action ploys. My feeling is that Irving tries to emulate Robertson Davies, but he shouldn't even try. If he sticks to his own style, as in such works as PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY, CIDER HOUSE RULES, and A SON OF CIRCUS, he'll be just fine. Just because an author is a big name doesn't mean he can write a good book EVERY time. I mourn the trees lost on the paper for this 'work'."
2,Disappointed after waiting so long.,I am unaccustomed to feeling disappointment at the end of an Irving novel. The plot was uninventive. It had a disjointed sense and I felt no emotional attachment to any of the characters. There is a common personality type in many of his main male characters that is getting tiresome.I adore Irving and all of his other novels. This one was disappointing and anti-climactic.
1,Lots of wool pulled over lots of eyes,"How could anyone begin to believe that an intelligent, caring woman would hide in a prostitute's closet to gain material for a new book? I was enthralled to the middle of the book but it then looked like an automaton wrote the last half.....a terrible cop-out for Mr. Irving and a total waste of my time and money. I should have listened to the many friends who said they couldn't finish the book........"
2,Disappointed Irving Fan,"I have been a fan of John Irving's novels for some time. However, I was recently disappointed with this novel. Irving's characters, most often New Englanders living in prep-school towns have always been humorous, quirky and awkwardly loveable for their flaws. In this novel, Irving unfortunately recycles many of these character types, ultimately selecting a self-absorbed female novelist who is, not only surrounded by an extended family of writers (tiresome in itself), and feels the need to extend her lame autobiographical experiences into her own writing. The plots and sub-plots of this novel are weak. With the dearest intent, I sincerely hope that Mr. Irving has not run out of ideas. Although I finished all 500-some pages; I am regretful to say that the three parts could've been compressed into a mere 300 or so. In addition, I was irritated with the amount of circular (and boring) narrative that surrounded the often sex-crazed (but not shocking) and shallow characters."
3,Fair for Irving,"The novel is tremendously overwrought. But being a fan of Mr. Irving's I read on. I found the book tedious at times, and this for me was a first with one of his books. I have read seven of them now and this is my least favorite. The only character who I felt sympathy for was Marion, Ruth's mother and Eddie's lover."
2,The same book that Irving has been writing since Garp.,"This book contains all of the usual devices that led me to stop reading John Irving after college. It was only at the insistance of a neighbor that I read it at all. The formula-Take a few reasonably well developed though quirky characters, then kill or maim them or their loved ones in ways designed to play on the darkest fears of the reader. The structure of ""A Widow for a Year"" is the same one we have come to know from all of Irvings other offerings. While the storytelling is workmanlike, what we have here is a combination of the morbid fascination of looking at a car crash combined with a story with hooks that keep the reader turning the pages. In the final analysis, the experince is a bit like watching an episode of Jerry Springer."
3,"Interesting, but too long and too expansive","As Irving often does, this book flirts with being a pornographic novel...it is extremely profane and at times very sexually graphic. The premise is unique and done well, especially at the beginning and the end. The middle section is long and quite tedious. I still feel that his ""Prayer for Owen Meany"" is his best effort. I have not recommended this book to any of my friends, even though there are a few good things about it."
3,A disappointed fan,"I am a fan of John Irving, but I was disappointed by this novel. The characters and their reactions were not believable. As always, Irving's characters were described vividly. Their situations were unique and interesting. However, I was unable to feel for the characters or understand their behavior. I did not become involved with these characters as I have with past Irving novels."
5,An excellent novel with a simple/complicated plot,"I have read all of John Irving's books, and I was a bit disappointed, when I tried to get through ""A Son of the Circus"". ""Widow"", however, thrilled me from the beginning and I was reminded of Irving's great works, like ""Garp"" or ""Cider House Rules"". Mr Irving is an expert in creating the right atmosphere for each setting. His open, but also delicate handling of the sex-theme appeals to me. His characters are portrayed very cleverly and memorably. I enjoyed reading the book very much."
1,I was disappointed in this book.,"I had heard so much about John Irvings work, that I couldn't wait to start this book. I valiantly struggled to finish it, but gave up before reaching the halfway point. The tedious style of writing did nothing to enliven the characters.I found I was becoming irritated when Ruth, as a child, asked the same questions incessantly. I also couldn't see how diverging into every minor character's mundaneness was central to the theme of the story. Maybe you just have to be a fan, but my advice--skip it!"
3,too sad to be enjoyable,"and is too sad to see that I'm not very original because for me ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"" and ""The Cider House Rules"" are superior novels.Sin embargo,John Irving is a very good writer and ""Widow For One Year"" is a good book even thought I liked the first part better than the second part,but I confess that I skipped the part of the final driving test,I don't have the stomach for that kind of details. I loved all the characters,specially Eddie, but I didn't like the way that Irving treated the subplot of their work,I thought it was very obvious."
3,"Starts great,but fades in the middle.","A Widow For One Year looks at the long term affect (into the next generation ) the tragic death of two teen age boys has on a family. When the novel begins it is 1958. The boys have been dead several years and we are spending the summer in the Hamptons with Ted and Marion(the boys parents),Ruth(their four year old daughter) and Eddy , a 16 year old student who comes to work for Ted and Marion for the summer. This first section is brilliant-one moment hilariously funny and the next heartbreakingly sad. It reminded me of Anne Tyler's writing at its best. When th narrative leaps forward many years(too many) we all but lose sight of Ted, Marion and Eddy and the story loses much of its charm. I felt the ending was good but overall the novel does not deliver on the promise of the great first third."
2,Is this what happens to all writers,"I really loved almost everthing Mr. Irving has done but it seems that, like many writers, he has run out of creativity andonly writes about being a writer. Sometimes over and over. I am just tired of writers writing books where the main charaters, in this book it seems like even the pets were writers, are writers. I think it lacks creativity. More bears and less writers!!"
2,Will this ever end?,I normally devour novels. This took me from August through February to finish. I finished it out of stubborness and and the fact I purchased the book and did not want to waste $$$. Enough said!
3,Is That All There Is?,"I liked it, truly. I laughed a good measure of the time, and was moved by the pivotal photographs and the space they once occupied, figuratively and literally. But what does a reader glean from this story and the people in it? That licentiousness and outright abandonment of children and spouse is not only charming, but acceptable? That the seduction of teenagers, while pathetic, is a legitimate basis for relationships? No one evolves, they just plod on in the pursuit of orgasm and good wine. Welcome to John Irving's world, where women are appendages attached to breasts and men are applauded for their Peter Pan tendencies; all life is an exercise in futility. Yikes!"
1,Nah! Forget this one!,Sorry Mr Irving...after 150 pages the hard going got too darn much and I packed it in.....not recommended.
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,A Widow For One Year was our pick for my book club this month and it left me wishing we'd picked something else. I don't know why reviewers thought this was comic or interesting -- the hype surrounding it is just hype. No one in the book is likable; the actions the characters take is not believeable. It seems to be a book about sex and people who refuse to grow up and get on with their lives. Dissapointing.
1,Why?,"Sorry, after getting half-way through this book, I couldn't summon up any interest in finishing it. No particular complaints; sometimes an author leaves a reader wondering why he bothered to write a book and why the reader should bother to read it. (Not finishing a book is _very_ rare for me.)"
2,"By far, Not His Best Work","Having read the majority of Mr. Irving's works and throughly enjoying all have have read, I was sadly disappointed with this novel. Editorial reviews, which I have now learned to ignore, claimed that Ruth was one of his best characters yet! Where they reading the same book I was? Ruth does not possess any of the flare that his other main characters often have. She, and the other characters in this book, is dull. I had to force myself to finish this novel. I usually look foward to re-reading his novels, this novel will most likely end up in a garage sale."
3,A widow for a Year,"I didn't mind this book. I just expected something a bit different I guess from the author. What with his other novels - The world according to Garp.I read the whole book over the course of a weekend so I obviously got involved in it! But I just didn't think it was brillant. I probally never would have chosen to read the book normallly but I read it as part of a book club I am involved in. When I picked it up at the bookshop I thought it sounded a bit soft and romantic. Then I thought well it's written by ""whats his name - Irving"" so I thought it probally isn't as soppy and romantic as I first imagined.Anyway, the long and short of it is it's Ok. But if you had told be Daniella Steele or Judith Krantz wrote the book I wouln't at all be surprised. Beacause that's what it was like - a Daniella Steele novel!"
2,this was the same writer who gave us GARP?,"I can't believe it... GARP was such a masterpiece, and this was such drivel. Disappointing!"
3,too loooooooooooooong,I nearly bailed about half way through - found too much repetition - plot too unlikely. Not one of his better books.
4,"Tom woke up, but Tim did not.","Some books are meant for audiences with interests in themes such as death of adolescent children, its affect on the married couple, how each copes, father-daughter bond and sexual relationship between older women and younger men. ""A Widow for One Year"" is such a book and addresses these themes in fine writing. Ted Cole, the husband, is a flawed character who turns to adultery more avidly after the accident that kills his two teenage sons. Ruth Cole, the mother, mourns by withdrawing from the world and withholding affection from her younger daughter conceived after the accident. This is Mr. Irving's first novel I read and it easily met my expectations. The only thing I wish he had reconsidered was length of the book. At over 400 pages the book begins to loose some of its early magic by page 325 or so. Also, I recommend watching the movie version in which Kim Basinger and Jeff Bridges are great as a couple."
1,A pseudonym?,"I am very disappointed in this book. To me it was idle ramblings of a bored writer. It contained long passages of repetitive descriptions, which in my mind had nothing whatsoever to do with the story - for the was a story there but it was overpadded with witter. The book could have easily been editted down to 100 pages. Maybe John Irving is a pseudonym for Eddie O'Hare!"
2,Disapointed,"I want to say that first and foremost I am an avid reader, always giving a book a chance. After reading 90 pages of this book and waiting for it to show signs of hope I gave up. I was very surprised to see that it was a New York Times bestseller and notable book. I guess I should of read some of his better books first because after reading the reviews on this sight I saw that this was not one of John Irving's better books. I felt the book was very boring. I also felt that it had no plot, I just couldnt keep interest. I'm sorry if I have offended any Irving fans, but I just found that the author gave to much information. I found myself wanting to skip paragraphs, which I never do."
1,It's a book without heart,"If you're looking for an engaging book and you've heard John Irving is fabulous, skip this novel. You'll be disappointed. Try A Prayer for Owen Meany instead.Irving tells his story from such a great distance that none of his characters are people you can care at all about. The language is crude and the plot relies so heavily on absurd coincidences, that as I turned the pages, I became more and more frustrated. It is possible to create a fantastic ending or story arc if a writer has the right touch with humor and surprise, but in this work, Irving seems like he's ""phoning it in.""He touches on important issues and there are touching moments. Some of his narrative devices are effective and compelling, but overall the book lacks a soul. Skip this and look for John Irving elsewhere. You won't find him here."
2,"The scenarios seemed contrived, uninteresting characters.","As this was my first Irving book, and I had heard such great things about his writing, I expected to sit back and be thoroughly entertained. No such luck. I was relatively bored by Ruth as a main character. Her raucus friend Hannah seemed more interesting. And- big deal about the older woman, 16 yr. old boy story. Shocking? Not really. If the story was about Eddie's life after this love affair, it would have been much more colorful. Not much room in this book for titilation either, lest a murder get in the way. Yawn. Drawbacks: boring, and slightly interesting from chapter to chapter Positives: At least there was some resolution of conflicts- or hint at it. Loved the ending. Clever final dialogue."
1,Who cares about these characters?,"Going back to F. Scott Fitzgerald and beyond, it's the same old dilemma: Rich people make boring characters, and we don't care about their various dysfunctions and neuroses.There's not one likeable character in this book. They're all a bunch of spoiled, Volvo-driving, squash-playing yuppies.Maybe Irving was trying to do satire here, but the subject matter isn't worth satirizing.Irving is a very florid and wordy writer, in the tradition of Dickens, whom he admires. Well, at least Dickens wrote about real people, with real conflict coming from external circumstances. The conflict here comes from the pathology of the characters' sick and narcissistic minds--people who never had a creative thought in their lives because they were too busy worrying about ""themselves."" Who cares?Irving's novels always remind me that humanism is a hopeless philosophy."
4,Another Winner!,"Irving's newest entry is not quite as moving as ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"" but is still an impressive work. He is one of the few writers today that can tell a damn fine story. I was enraptured from the first chapter to the last and would highly recommend it for a long weekend reading session!!"
1,Betrayed by a lazy John,"I wish I had waited for the paperback so I could have wasted only seven bucks. A Prayer for Owen Meany and The Cider House Rules are two of the best pieces of new fiction I have read. A Widow for A Year, however, is a big disappointment. After the first part, this life story in three parts is simply a boring rehash of Irving's themes. Don't waste your time or money."
3,Entertaining enough to finish.,"This is my first John Irving book, though I have heard his work reviewed before. I thought the characters were somewhat like those in a Woody Allen movie. A little bizarre! It's worth reading;"
2,Such a disappointment,"It's hard to believe this is the same author who wrote the extraordinary Cider House Rules. It felt to me like one long (in Irving fashion) rebuttal letter to his critics. This book was transparently Irving's forum for justifying, through character Ruth, his style and choices in past works. If you read the book, you'll understand. Yes, I believe a man can write from a woman's viewpoint. No, I don't believe Irving was able to pull it off in Widow. The book read like a Sidney Sheldon novel. The only difference is that (so far) it's not embarrassing to read a John Irving book on the bus. The story was entirely predictable, the writing simplistic and even dumbed-down and the cliches ran rampant. I was expecting something more heady from one of my favorite American authors."
2,Find another book...,"After a strong start, it's all downhill--unless you're really a fan of trite plot, unconvincing characters, and a cliche ending. Don't judge a book by its author."
3,One third of a great novel,"The first third of this novel--Eddie's account of his affair with Marion when he was sixgteen--the engine that drives the rest of the book--is magical--on a par with THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP. It's darkly imaginative, charming, and impossible to put down. Unfortunately, the rest of the novel doesn't live up to the beginning. It's still an interesting read. All of the characters have gotten stuck in some way or another--unable to really get on with their lives as the result of their past. It's interesting reading to see how everything works out--but Irving doesn't hold me the way he does at the beginning of the novel."
4,A 4.5 star read by Irving,"I'm a friend of modern classics. I feel this is destined to be one of them.John Irving has a knack for taking you inside the world of his characters, a world often bizarre at best. Just at the edge of ""believeability"", he manages to make you part of his worlds. It was true in Garp, it is true in Widow for One Year. Ruth Cole, her best friend Hannah, and even the pitiable Eddie grow on you. You become invested in their lives, to the point where you want to know more when you turn that last page and find it is over.Egotistical it may be to write a book about writers, but the references, the satire, and the intimate feel make this book darkly comical and distinctly social.I recommend this book to anyone who likes to consider their world while reading, and afterwards."
2,Overrated Irving,"I love the writer but do not love what he's written here. The story never gets up to speed. The characters do not ""live"" the way they do in Irving's better books (see Hannah and the adult Eddie O'Hare). ""Widow"" is a series of episodes which culminate merely with a couple of lives having been lived; I know this is what life is about, but not great fiction. Irving has done much better, especially with ""Owen Meany"" and ""Garp""."
2,Irving's Mid-write Crisis,"To be plain and simple about it...this is hardly one of Irving's greatest accomplishments. It doesn't even touch ""The Cider House Rules."" Don't get me wrong, I finished the book and managed not to be thoroughly disappointed...but one thing is for certain, it did not leave me in anticipation every time I put the book down. While there is no doubt that John Irving is a talented (if not brilliant) literary novelist,this saga of the life of Ruth Cole was slightly better than luke-warm.I'd have to say that Irving should have spent less time with incessant detail and more time with raw emotion...I saw little of that here.In a nut shell, I found this novel to be somewhat predictable...and without trying to sound ridiculous, it seems more like it would have been written by Danielle Steele."
3,Not bad...not the best,"After never having read John Irving before, I was curious enough to read, ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"" which I absolutely loved. I soon followed that up with ""The World According to Garp"" which I also enjoyed tremendously. Having read those two novels first, I obviously had high expectations for this book. And while it is a good book, I was still a little dissapointed in it. The classic ""Irving earmarks"" are there such as writers, prostitutes, sexual curiousity. But I almost gave up on this book. I kept waiting for it to...start. And just as Ruth had the ""bad boyfriend"" experience, I really started to get into it. And once I was really into it, it ended. I still consider it to be a good read, but you have to work your way through the somewhat tedious beginning to get to the gold towards the end."
3,SOOOO LONG,"As a big John Irving fan, I was excited to read this book when it came out. However, I was slightly dissapointed to see that Irving's indulgent tendencies that were always kept at bay before came into the forefront with this novel. Simply put, it is way too long. As a reviewer wrote before, I too was put off by the all-encompassing, nothing-left-to-the-imagination, happy ending. One thought: I thought this book would have been BRILLIANT if it was just the first part. If the book would have ended when Eddie left that summer, I would have given this five stars."
4,and then the widow...,"John Irving has written another book of some interest to those willing to explore their inner selves when faced with the craziness of life. Like Owen, Homer and Garp, Ruth too must deal with a life that never quite adds up. I found this to be near his best, right along side of Cider House and Owwn Meany. Give it some time and you find parts of it continue to creep into your thoughts. ""Life of meaning: to be of use: a sound like soemone trying not to make a sound""...all of these stick. If literature is written so we remember and are marked by it--JI is hitting the mark."
3,Too Many Wonderful Characters,"John Irving creates some of his most incredible characters in this book. The problem is there are too many good characters and as you want to get to know more about one, Irving switches gears and you now are in the middle of someone else's life. This proves to be very disconcerting and takes your attention away from the plot. Much more focussed than Son of the Circus, A Widow for One Year is enjoyable but lacks the emotional depth of Garp or Owen Meany."
1,I waited for this?,"What a disappointment - I struggled through the first part of the book and then decided that life is too short to have to endure such bad writing from the man who gave us Garp, Owen Meany and The Hotel New Hampshire. Mr Irving, you have failed us - shame on you."
2,Not Irving's Best Work,"WIDOW is not as compelling reading as was GARP, CIDER HOUSE, or OWEN MEANY. I found it tedious and overly long for the story it offers. The characters were interesting, but disappointingly not fully developed. Curiously, I found myself more interested in reading Ted Cole's children's books than in finishing WIDOW. The scary children's book ideas were intriguing!"
2,Sex and Crime isn't enough for an Irving fan,Being an Owen Meany addict I was very dissappointed about the Widow's blandness. Somewhere in the book it is mentioned that fiction authors shouldn't go autobiographic. I believe that Mr. Irving should stick to his own advise. Keep inventing the unbelievable and unreal - I guarantee I'll stay your fan! Sex and crime doesn't suffice for an Irving fan.
3,"Not his best, but even so-so Irving is pretty good...","This story-within-a-story novel is not on a par with some of John Irving's other work, such as ""The World According to Garp"" and ""A Prayer for Owen Meany."" Even so, it was an engaging read.Irving's style is evident, with the most outrageous things happening to his characters. There is a murder, a philanderer is chased and nearly stabbed by one of his paramours, death and almost death by carbon monoxide poisoning, gum stuck in the most unlikely places...It almost makes you breathless, just keeping up.I wish the characters had been a little more sharply drawn, particularly Eddie.However, still a book I would recommend."
5,"Proof that a man can write a real, interesting woman","A Widow for One Year is on the same level as The World According to Garp and A Prayer for Owen Meany. Irving has a unique gift for making you laugh harder than you though possible, and then feeling bad for laughing at what turn out to be terrible misfortunes and tragedies. He has a true narrative gift, other reviewers claimed that he could be hard to follow, but I would vehemently disagree. If you have a the combination of a sense of humor but require more than a chuckle from novels, if you're daring to look for some sort of ""literary value"" than John Irving's latest is sure to please."
2,Only for die-hard Irving fans,"As a huge fan of JI, I was disappointed in this book. It's not a bad book, but it's not Irving. It didn't grip me as much as the others, wasn't was funny, and the characters weren't a memorable."
1,Why is this a best-seller?,"I really do not understand. I enjoyed The World According to Garp, I tolerated his other books, but A Widow... just bored me to death. I gave up reading it about 2/3 the way through, and I have never in my life stopped reading a book. Fellow readers--this one is not worth the time or effort."
1,"Boring, waste of time reading. Depravity. Much too long.","I found this book to be boring, and a waste of my time. Irving overdoes the sex thing. There was no real substance to the book, and went off in too many different directions. Much too long and drawnout. Could have been effectively said in half the pages.Disappointing reading and a waste of my money."
5,Just what I expect from Irving,"Unexpected twists and some shocking incidents were evident throughout the book. The characters were well defined and each had an appeal which made me want them to return to action.I wanted the book to go on, and savored the last 100 pages. The ending was dead-ass perfect. This is as good as Irving gets."
3,Same Old Irving (With Some Fun Twists!),"A Widow for One Year is sooo typical of John Irving in so many ways. A novel about authors, with samples of their work and their struggles (poor writers). Some of the ideas are identical to those used in his previous novels (e.g., the prostitute stuff). The biggest difference in A Widow, however, is that the characters in this novel are much richer, realistic and sympathetic. All of the characters are worthy of interest, and even the cruelest has some very endearing, almost likeable qualities. Some plot twists make this a good John Irving-roll your eyes at the old stuff-read. I would have liked it even more if I hadn't read Garp, Hotel New Hampshire and Cider House Rules all those years ago."
1,The worst book I've ever voluntarily read start to finish,"Did John Irving really write this or did he employ a 7th-grade ghost writer? He reduces his main character Ruth, a supposedly world class literary fiction writer, to the size of her breasts. Obsess much? There is only one mildly likable character (Eddie) -- even the 4-year-old children in the book are annoying. The children's dialogue is completely unbelievable, unless these kids are intellectual freaks. The entire book is littered with exclamation marks, which remind me of ""applause"" signs so a TV studio audience knows what's ""good."" But you won't walk away from this book empty-handed: you'll get a wonderful recipe for stir-fry shrimp, John Irving's work-out routine and a few squash-playing tips. I'll be happy if I can get $2 for this thing at a yard sale."
5,America's master storyteller in top form!,"When I reached the final paragraph of A WIDOW FOR ONE YEAR all I could do was burst into tears. A perfect ending to a beautifully engaging story. A week after I finished it I got to see and hear John Irving read the ""Masturbating Machine"" chapter at the Rizzoli bookstore in Santa Monica, CA. To hear the creator of these wonderful words read them aloud was, to put it mildly, an incredible treat. A WIDOW FOR ONE YEAR is a treasure not unlike A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY. The latter work being, without question, Irving's un-toppable masterpiece."
3,Writing about writers - who are writing about writers,"Irving is an excellent writer, with fluid prose and clear characterizations. His plots are compelling, and the stories involve effective human drama. But this book strikes me as self-indulgent to a too-large extent. The main characters are all wealthy folk, that live in a rarefied atmosphere redolent of specialized inks and more specialized neuroses. They are all either writers or writers-to-be - as though this were the only proper human ambition to have.And the worst of it is that the writer who is his main character is writing about a writer - an endless loop of navel-gazing. Outside of that, there is real drama in the family interrelationships. All the characters, their actions and relationships revolve around the central drama of the deaths of 2 brothers, and the separation of their parents.It is an excellent read, though I found the writer-writer-writer theme annoying enough to intrude into my suspension of disbelief."
1,Irving at his worst,"After reading Hotel New Hampshire and A Prayer for Owen Meany (one of the best books I have EVER read), Widow for One Year was completely dissapointing. The characters are dull and not well developed, and worst of all the plot resembles a Lifetime movie. If you like Danielle Steele or romance novels, I recommend this book highly."
2,Unbelievable!,"I'm surprised that many reviewers recommend this book as a good one for first time readers of John Irving. As a first time reader of John Irving, this book might be my last. It wasn't the prose or even the characters that bothered me, but the foundation of the story itself.As a mother of a 16-year-old boy, I find it utterly implausible that anyone could believe that Marion would seduce someone that reminded her of her dead son. Do we have reason to believe that she had fantasies of incest? Did her perverted husband have reason to believe it?You don't have to be a prude to find the multitude of references to masterbation and to the size of Ruth's breasts tiresome. This book is heavy on sex, and light on reality."
3,Finished It,"I picked this book up because it was on Stephen King's list of books in ""On Writing"" that King enjoyed. It was good, but not great. I am still trying to figure out what recommended it so strongly to Stephen King....The story was mostly fast-paced with a rhythmic plot but it got bogged down in obsessive descriptions of photographs, the main characters' breasts, and, worst of all, musings about writing. When you are a successful writer like John Irving it's probably acceptable to defy the truism that writers should not write about writers, but having all four main characters be professional writers proved too much. The writing about writing seemed self-indulgent & took me away from the story, which was the book's strength. I would not recommend this book to anyone but John Irving fans. Like many readers, I liked Cider House Rules and Owen Meany much better than Widow for One Year."
3,Enjoyable Read,"No question that this is an enjoyable read. At times, Irving can be repetitive, going over the same things until you just want to skip over portions (his descriptions of photographs comes to mind).As in Garp, Irving punishes certain characters for sexual transgressions, and knowing that Irving likes to do this, you expect this familiar device to appear. Knowing that Irving fully believes in ""What goes around, comes around"" tarnishes the experience of reading the novel, because you know what surprises to expect (no longer a surprise if you expect it).This book is not comparable to Garp, but an enjoyable read, nevertheless."
2,Ho-hum...,"I have been a fan of Irving's work in the past, but I found ""Widow"" a bit of a non-event. Mercifully Irving has abandoned his obsessions with bears, Vienna and wrestling, the familiar theme of prostitution (that is not sleeping with, but simply talking to prostitutes, as in Garp) surfaces again in this work.While the story is entertaining enough, the writing fails to sparkle. Irving's repeated use of italics for emphasis is grating. And as for other reviewers who have remarked on the absence of coincidences in this,as compared with Irving novels, wouldn't you call a family where mother,father and daughter (and the mother's ex-lover) are all published writers a little unusual? Give it a miss. Read ""Enduring Love"" by Ian McEwan instead."
1,yawn....z-z-z-z-z-z,"The desperation of the movie industry's tendency to produce movies about movie-makers is surpassed by this writer's writing about writers. John, put away the ""Playboy"" magazine and get out of the cabin once in a while!"
3,Not always believable,"John Irving does a great job of showing how almost all the lives in this book are affected by two deaths that occurred years before. The characters are complex, with the exception of Hanna, a two-dimensional harridan (why did Ruth put up with her ? )The plot was believable until the murder which occurs about halfway through the book. The subsequent actions relating to this crime, as well as the marriage that comes out of it, are totally unbelievable and inconsistent with Ruth's character up to that point.In general, I would recommend the book. There's certainly enough to discuss if you're in a reading group."
3,Not profound but still enjoyable,"While Prayer for Owen Meany 's implausibility could be accepted as part the fable that novel was, Widow is similarly implausible yet it seems we are asked to take it more seriously and it is far less profound. Despite the gimmicky coincidences and contrivances, John Irving still fills books with characters that the reader really gets to know and enjoy. While other John Irving books are better, if you like John Irving, you'll like this."
3,not the vintage Irving I am used to,"I had great expectations of Irvings latest.This novel disappointed. The heroine is unconvincing,and the graphic sex very boring.The skill of writing is the main theme here,interspersed with incidents which lacked the humor and genius of previous novels such as""Cider House"" or ""Owen Meany"". The whole book has a contrived feel about it. What a pity! I am a very loyal Irving reader, and I waded through the book to the end, even growing to like our heroine. But this one is not for new Irving readers, and I hope this is not signalling the end of what we really expect of an author of his stature."
2,Long winded and disappointing,I have been an avid Irving fan since I was in Jr High. I anticipate all his new arrivals with tingles. I am sure that I will laugh and cry. This time I did. Part 1 was great. I was curious about Part 2. It was all I could to finish it. Why? It totally faltered and was dull and predictable. I am afraid the creator of my all time favorite character has let me down. Next time I buy paperback and read the reviews.
2,next book..,I found this book to be too long for the actual story it told. It went on and on and on and by the time I was finished I was totally unsatisfied. Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah...finish it already. I loved Owen Meaney but this was a major dissapointment.
4,Love Conquers Grief...Eventually,"I always look for the moral in a John Irving novel because he doesn't seem ever completely to be able to avoid weighing in on some contemporary socially significant issue. This book is about sex and about love. Irving illustrates that while some non-traditional sexual liaisons are trivial and meaningless at best, demeaning and victimizing at worst, other non-traditional sexual liaisons may overcome all odds and transcend the years. The difference is love. ""A Widow for One Year"" contains perhaps Irving's simplest and purest message. Love prevails, sex does not. We all know that. After reading ""A Widow for One Year,"" we believe it... for a little while anyway."
2,"Production-line,commercialized story","This is the lowest quality novel produced by John Irving. The plot, cheesy and disconnected, a conglomerate of various mini stories, is almost an attempt to create an interest around a rather blunt storyline. The quick, gratuitus conclusions to each story (violent lovers get their knee broken, murderers get discovered, the bad guys run into the end of their line) will make good airplane reading - if there's no sit-com on the screen. Even worse, the writing style itself is not up to par with previous writing by Mr. Irving. The language handling is hasty and unworthy of previous examples."
3,Not Irving's best work...,"Anyone who is a big John Irving fan will be disappointed by his latest novel. It took me forever to get into the story. The first chapter is downright dull. Once I was able to get into it, it was an okay read, but I found myself unable to put it down only because I couldn't wait to get through the dang thing and get on with more interesting stuff. If you are a big Irving fan, I recommend skipping this one and re-reading Owen Meany or Cider House!"
5,A Fun Book,"If you are willing to ""suspend your disbelief"", this is the book for you. Totally outrageous plots make "" Widow For One Year""--the fun book that it is. Hard to fathom that Eddie would hold a torch for close to 40 years for his first love who was 23 years older than him --and that in the end the two lovers are reunited--but then--there is a happy ending. I loved Ruth's character development throughout the book---and the fact that once she became a a mother--she was complete---. I must admit though, the scene with Wim in Amsterdam--was sort of weird. Tim being chased by Mrs. Vaughn was hilarious, as was the ""interesting"" scene in Amsterdam's red line district. It is true that ""sorrow is contagious"", as is said by Marion towards the end of the book, but this book, with all its sad moments, was a fun book which I had a hard time putting down."
3,"Loved the book, hated the ending","As a long time Irving fan (A Prayer for Owen Meany is still the best book I ever read), I enjoyed reading this book. It seemed like a book in search of an ending. I certainly hoped that Eddie was reunied with Marion, and that Marion would heal from the loss of Thomas and Timothy, allowing her to be there for Ruth and her son. I got all of that, but the ending was anticlimactic. I am not sure what I wanted, certainly not another AARP version of ""60 days,"" but I found the ending wanting. Maybe it's just like the ending in ""Sideways."" You know what happens .... fill in the blanks. I just wanted more. Still an enjoyable story."
2,John Irving needs an editor badly,"If you think back to Garp and earlier novels and compare them to his most recent novels you get the notion that Irving has lost all sense of editorial constraint. Yes, there are some mildly amusing monents but they are few and far between. I used to wait eagerly for a new Irving novel and I had high hopes for this new one. I fear he has lost his muse and is just writing on technique with noheart to back it up. John- reread Cider House andOwen Meany. Maybe you can find your way back byhome. Try writing a 300 page novel next time andleave out all the filler. I think I'll go reread Owen meany."
5,"""Widow"" begs for your attention.","Once again Irving has created an odd lot of characters, mostly likeable, although in the case of Ted, it is sometimes difficult. Read this book with your disbelief willingly suspended. There are a few too many hard-to-swallow coincidences coupled with a pat ending to make this a GREAT novel, but as usual you read Irving for his well-drawn characters and his ability to create comedic situations on a par with the best of them. The scene in which Ted breaks up with one of his paramours is worth the price of the book."
2,Is this the author of The world... Cider House rules...,"Having so enjoyed Mr Irving's first books, this is a real disappointment. The story line is unfocused and the characters loose in being too detailed. None of them are people you would want to know. The subplots and interminable descriptions that add nothing to the drama or comedy (e.g.the time spent in Amsterdam) are distracting. Mr Irving's habit of underlying seems to indicate that he doesn't think the reader of sufficient intellect to ""get it"". The humour is just too facile. All in all, in the same league as his last novel. Has Mr Irving lost his abilitiy. Hard to think."
2,How the mighty hath fallen!,"The beginning was kind of amusing and beguiling, but the second half of this book left me with literary heartburn. I'm afraid Irving once more fails to live up to the standards he set in *GARP*. In the end, Widow is as trite and predictable as a one-star movie plot, and I couldn't wait for it to be over."
2,"A VERY LONG, DRAWN OUT BOOK","This is the first/only book of John Irvings I've read and probably the last. Although I DID enjoy the book and the characters, his writing style is just too wordy for my tastes. I found myself 'speed reading' through parts of it just to FINALLY get to the end. If the book would've been half the size I would've rated it higher because the story and characters ARE interesting and I found sympathizing with Ruth and all that she had been through."
1,"FOR SHAME, JOHN IRVING","I was sorely disappointed in this book. As somene who loved Owen Meany and the intricate messages underlying, this novel was porely crafted, and a sad regurgitation of what is obviously the same plot line or a trauma of Mr. Irving's youth. Mr. Irving, we who selectively choose our books and are not entertained by the Harlequin caliber or the Kay Scarpettas of the fictional world expect more from those whom we know are more talented. We are not easily amused by aggregious sex scenes, cumbersome alduterous relationships and unfulfilled women seeking healing from the emotional scars of their youth. Digest the world a little more thoroughly and possibly seek a sabbatical. We are harder on you because we know you can do better, and somehow this makes us even more indignant."
2,Really disappointing,"John Irving has a nice style, but does he really have anything to say in this book. Maybe I just didn't get it, but I couldn't wait to finish it so I could go read something else. And why are so many of his characters writers?"
1,Snore City,"I guess Irving is trying to be Wally Lamb - trying to make it to Oprah. Whatever the case, this is a weak and silly book. The characters are all reroutes of those created by better authors, and the plot is senseless."
3,An Irving novel misfire is like a Kubrick film misfire...,"A John Irving novel that misfires is like a Stanley Kubrick film that misfires; it still has the right stuff to engage us long after we've turned out the bedside light or the movie house has grown dark. Where ""Widow..."" is off center in its Dickensian targeting is substance. We come away from this novel as from a great meal during which we were surprised to be only stylishly served dessert; a fine dessert - visually interesting, well-crafted, PLENTIFUL, filling but not satiating. I found myself asking, ""Please, sir, may I have MORE."""
4,"excellent concept- but ""average"" execution","The core of this novel, to me, is about how truly deep relationships cannot be diminished by time and distance. Through the characters in the story we see how obsessions can be ""magnificent"" or tragic. That's the good news.The bad news, unfortunately, is that the author's writing was very tedious in several parts of the novel: he kept repeating the same thoughts --with no deeper insights -- page after page.The only thing that kept me reading was the compelling nature of the novel's theme. I waded thru the tedious parts just to see how it would all end. I must admit though; when I did get to the end, I had tears in my eyes!"
2,For Irving fans only. Others won't get it.,"Not a classic like Owen and Garp, not a total waste of time like Circus, this novel will be lost on those not already familiar with Irving (unless they like the word breasts). I think his next work needs a character or two that the reader can really care about."
4,"A delight for lovers of books, the makings of an author.","Irving's novels rarely miss for me, and Widow for One Year is no exception. While I did not find myself as emotionally entralled as with my two Irving favorites (Garp and the Cider House Rules), I found plenty of enjoyment nonetheless. Although Irving frequently sets the stage for his characters developing as writers, Widow explores the histories and psyches of several characters' development into all sorts of authors. From the bestselling protagonist to her morbid children's story writing father, all sorts of writers are explored. As an avid reader, I loved the typical Irving slant to the behind-the-scenes worlds of novelists and their novels."
1,Dog-do: Sophomoric high school boy stuff,"I detested this book. I read it for my book club and threw it away in disgust. Many of us in the club felt the same way. Trust me; there will be a bonfire when we talk about this book. How can someone write that many pages about breasts and cashmere sweaters and how jeans fit? Come on! There's much more to life and people than that. The characters had no depth, no souls, and I had no desire to know them as people. At a cocktail party, if I'd met someone like ANY of them, I would have moved on. I prefer REAL books."
2,What the Deuce?,"Personally, I can't understand why anyone would want a book with a picture of the author on the cover. Instantly, this dissuades me from purchasing the book! I mean... like... Is John Irving supposed to be a character in the book? Unless he IS actually a character in the book, the appropriate place for his photo is on the back of the book at the very worst!"
3,Fearless Story Telling,"Typical Irving. Fearless, raw, somewhat contrived, sad, comic, endlessly imaginative. As usual, expert writing from an American icon."
3,A Widow for One Year,"John Irving is a wonderful storyteller. In his books - at least the ones I have read so far, I always have trouble wading through the many, unnecessary details. In his novels Irving seems to have trouble sticking to one theme. Half way through the novel other plots crop up that are related to the plot, yet somehow take the focus away from the main theme. His writing style is similar to that of the of the 19th century naturalist writers, such as Zola, Balzac, Frank Norton. And, one more thing, A Widow for One Year has way too much explicit sex, at least for my taste."
4,Irving does it again,Author comes up with new ideas that keep his works exciting and new. He is one of the most creative writers I've read and weaves a tale that can grab the reader's heart every time!
4,big fan,"bought these for my daughter who is a big Yankees fan, she just loved them. She mounted one on the wall and smiles every time she eats from them. Just wish they had told me they were plastic."
4,Lots of Pretty Pictures,"This book has many lovely pictures. Some of the text identifying the pieces is very complete, but some of it is rather scanty. The pictures and the text describing the fascination of Vaseline Glass made me a believer. No guidance on how to tell reproductions and re-introductions from the genuine antique stuff, and no prices. But a good explanation of how to use a black light to tell Vaseline from other yellow glass. Don't buy this book for reference; buy it for inspiration."
3,Little Content,"I was hoping for something that went into a lot more detail about the chemistry in aquariums, but this really just summarized the basics. Good for people just getting into the hobby though."
2,Simple book for beginners,Good book for beginners maybe. Generally covers all important topics but on very entry level. I didn't find here anything what couldn't be found in public resources on the web.
1,Too much for nothing,book was very much into the chemistry...it did not help with the regular issues we have with water in marine aquariums....no mentioning of issues related to presence of chemicals in water....may be people with knowledge in chemistry can try....
5,I am that,"Great book, specially for beginners who want to learn how to meditate! help to stay connected with the higher Self, to your own Heart"
3,Not impressed,"One of my cats has never touched these ever. The other cat plays with them about once a month or so. Not a favorite toy -- will be disposing of them during my next cat toy ""spring cleaning."""
1,"Thankfully, I read an excerpt of the book before I actually bought it.","I was very excited to find this book, as I have read other works by Roger Abrahams and absolutely loved them. Unfortunately, however, upon reading an excerpt of the book I discovered that one of the stories contained a tale in which a man, in his attemps to assert his superiority over a woman, repeatedly beats her. While I am not sure of what age bracket this book is meant for, the fact that that story was included, regardless of it folkoric accuracy, is very shocking. I'm very dissapointed."
4,Great Feel,I love the feel of the rain-like shower this shower head provides. It makes showers fun. The only thing is that after a while some of the holes became plugged. It may because of the minerals in the water building up. But It was easy to instal and easy to clean. Great shower head.
4,The Barbie Lip Gloss Maker!,"I am 11 years old and for my age it is not cool to play with Barbie toys. But when I got this lip gloss maker for a birthday present acouple days ago, my friends were all over me asking if they could come over and when they were over they asked if they could make some. Being the considerate friend I am, I said ""Sure!"" Well, ten pots of lip gloss later I was left with a machine and NO LIPGLOSS! So now I ma back on Amazon ordering a new machine (my brother broke the other one also) I hope that I don't have to share the lip gloss I make out of this one because I love it and the flavors are fun, delicious and creative! Well, I would like to thank Matell for making such a wonderful product!"
5,Great gift for the upcoming holidays,"I bought the Barbie Lipgloss Maker for my daughter's 6th birthday. She has had a lot of fun making the lip gloss and inventing her own colors. She just recently ran out of ingredients and I emailed Mattel and they emailed me an order form for ordering refills. There may have been one in the original box but I did not pay attention at the time. I thought refills would be available in the store. Even though I had to go through a little extra effort to get the refills, I still feel that this was a great buy because my daughter has had so much fun with it."
3,"a little messy, a few complaints, but FUN","At my age it is way uncool to play with Barbie or dolls , but my teacher says the my age (11) it perfect and we should open up our imagination to them. Well I did. I bought this and made one the first day. I love the scents! It is hard to wash the tools because the base is so greasy. Also, it didn't look all that great on me. Matell gives us way too little supplies and I only have one pot left and barely no base. It was a little too expensive and I don't know where to get refills. But, I really enjoyed making it! Its just the mess, amount of supplies and the expensive price that makes me not give it 100% satisfaction."
2,barbie lipgloss mess,"When I began Christmas shopping for my daughter I wanted to find something ""different"" that she hadn't asked for or seen before. The Barbie Lipgloss Maker seemed like a great surprise! However, after Christmas, when Abby was asleep I decided to test this ""gift"" myself so that I would know how to help her with it. At first, although a bit more involved than I expected, everything seemed ""OK"". But, after attempting ""lipgloss creation"" with Abby at least 4-5 times - all ending in a very messy disaster - I have chosen to pack that ""headache"" away before I throw it away and crush my daughter's feelings in order to save me from my own grief. The toy is great in theory, but in practice, is more of a headache than it's worth."
3,Fun for a Day,"I sincerely agee with the other reviewer. This toy was lots of fun for one day, only. I thought, at the time we bought the lip gloss maker, we would be able to order additional supplies (no contrary indication). We paid the highest list price for the product and now it sits in on the shelf."
2,Disappointing,"I suspect many folks considering this book are like me: really loved Seabiscuit, looking for more like it. This book had some glowing reviews on its cover (including one from Laura Hillenbrand) and mostly favorable reviews here, so I was optimistic. But I found the book very disappointing. The quality of the writing is second-rate. Her knowledge of the subject seems fine, but I wasn't looking for facts, I was looking for an engaging story. I wish I'd read the first 10 or 20 pages before buying it."
2,What happened to great writing?,"Whatever happened to great writers? (Or even good ones?) Miss Ours should have collaborated with one. She certainly doesn't ""meet Hillenbrand's standard"" (Booklist review) in any way. I agree that she exhaustively researched her facts, but then she set down a monotonous, inferior presentation of them. Sleep-inducing."
2,Tedious,"Ours certainly researched her topic, but the writing is so poor it never captures or holds our interest. I tried again and again to get into it but couldn't. This historical tale needs the touch of a good writer to draw us in so we're not faced with endless recitations of fact, and this is where Ours fails. Such a great, exciting horse deserves a story just as exciting! Even if you don't compare it to Hillenbrand's acclaimed work on Secretariat, Ours's book can't stand on its own merits."
5,CONTINUED: THE END OF THE STORY,"I just purchased this book yesterday. I'll come back here and present my formal rating, once I've read it.For the time being, however, I'm really really excited about the book! I've been in love with horses (and all things 'horses') since I was a girl. Imagine my joy when I randomly came across ""Man O' War""? Having also enjoyed ""Seabiscuit"" (again a childhood horse-hero), I personally am thrilled that Ms. Ours has presented us with a book about Big Red! Until now, we had only Walter Farley's excellent, fictional account. (And yes, I own all of his books!)Off to read now.....And read it I did! A wonderful book...but apparently not the only 'serious' treatise on this subject. Please check the comments on this review to see another good book on Man O'War."
4,BRIGHT AND HUGABLE,"Have this on my day bed. My guests love to play with them and talk about them. It's soft, durable, beautiful and educational at the same time."
4,Excellent alternative to.....,"These glasses are a terrific buy. You can two sets of six for basically the same price as ""the other guys"" single set, and believe me, you won't regret it. These are very nice, well balanced glasses. If you are looking for a great value in wine glassware, this is it. Enjoy."
1,DON'T BUY THIS GLASSES,I ordered 2 sets of 6 glasses over a month ago and only got 1 of glasses. I haven't been able to get a response from wineglassguys nor Amazon.
4,Perfect Match!,"I absolutely love this collection and i have been looking for the matching sham!So happy to have found it. Great price, great design -- vendor sent it out right away!"
1,disappointing,"I found this software to be very disappointing. It was easy to use, that was great since there weren't any directions, but the hairstyles were not realistic at all, or of many current styles. Also, the hair colors were not reflective of real colors, but very magic marker-ish. I really wanted to experiment with some new styles and I felt very frustrated that I couldn't really get a clear idea of what I might look like. I would not buy this again."
1,Very Disapointing,I couldn't wait to get my Cosmopolitan virtual makeover deluxe 2003 home and try it out..But was extremely dissapointed when I couldn't get anything but error messages when I tried to use it..Most of the reviews I've read about this software is about the same as mine..This software is a big waste of money..
2,Cosmo Virtual Makeover 2003,"This software was cheap enough, and it did help some in choosing the right makeup colors, hair color, and hairstyle. But it certainly leaves something to be desired. The makeup won't go on straight at all and looks like a total mess. The jewelry selection is limited to about 20 pieces which look like all the same style. The hairdo's are outdated and weird. They look like they're from the rock-n-roll 80's."
1,Total waste of time,"I thought this would be more interactive and allow you to try out hairstyles and makeup before it""s done on you but it is very limited.This program does not worth purchasing"
4,ADHD and Children,One of the best books around on teens. Very comprehensive and practical. The focus is on how ADHD affects teens and can impact family dynamics. The emphasis is on helping increase both parent and teen awareness and understanding of ADHD and the positive role medication can play. But that medication alone is not the answer.
5,Another Spiegelau Winner!,"After purchasing a set of Spiegelau's Bordeaux wine glasses several months ago, and being very impressed with their quality and price, I decided to order a set of their rocks glasses. Once again, the product delivered to my door is of exceptional quality and very nicely priced. The look is elegant and simple. The glass is well weighted, with a thick base tapering nicely to a thin rim. My only problem with these glasses is that they make me want to add another set of Spieglau's many styles to my kitchen . . . and I'm running out of space. I won't be able to resist temptation very long . . . and I think I'll be ordering the highball glasses next!"
2,unimpressed,"these glasses don't have the heft or size to accomodate a serious whisky drinker. Cute juice glasses, but not a cornerstone to your bar collection"
1,Cover disintegrating after two months,"The cushion is firm, not too big, nicely shaped for my 2012 Camry seats, and comfortable. The problem is that the front seam on the side facing the passenger is coming apart after only two months. I'm beginning to think this is what they meant by ""removable cover,"" since as other reviews have noted there doesn't seem to be a way to remove the cover. Unfortunately, my return window expired after only one month, so I can't return it, apparently not even to replace an obviously defective product. I'll keep this cushion for as long as I can, and may even try to re-cover it. But I won't buy another one and can't recommend it."
4,Good for long road trips,I used this cushion for a road trip from Texas to New York and back. I have serious disk issues in my lumbar region and without the cushion I probably would have had to make more stops. Kept me sitting up straight and provided good lower back support. I'm 5'8 and the cushion bought me very close to the steering wheel. Was OK since I was doing a very long drive but not good for the shorter trips around my hometown. Have to adjust the cushion a lot because it doesn't stay in place. Overall I recommend the cushion. Great for using around the house as well! Good luck.
3,Good help for your back,"Good support for your back on long drives. A bit hard, it needs precise positioning. The elastic band which comes with it is not suffcient for that: a stronger strap with velcro can take care of the problem."
3,Not what was described.,Pretty disappointed in the item description. It does not have a removable cover and does not have a strap for securing it in place. The only reason I did not return it is because I can use for my computer chair when I have sore back.
5,A Must-Read for All Women and/or Writers!,"Most definitely needs more stars!If you read (have read) or admire any of the sixteen writers profiled in this awesome book, then this little jewel will not disappoint you in the least. It's enlightening, inspiring, encouraging and instructive; a voyeuristic peek into the minds and writing habits of some of the best women writers of our generation. I loved what Anne Sexton told the interviewer when asked if she had any advice to young poets. She said, ""Put your ear close down to your soul and listen hard.""The writers interviewed are: Dorothy Parker, Marianne Moore, Maya Angelou, Susan Sontag, Anne Sexton, Katherine Anne Porter, Simone de Beauvoir, Nadine Gordimer, Toni Morrison, Joyce Carol Oates, Joan Didion, P.L. Travers, Eudora Welty, Rebecca West, Elizabeth Bishop and Mary McCarthy."
3,Recovering the Lost Self: Shame-Healing for Victims of Clergy Sexual Abuse (From the Interfaith Sexual Trauma Institute),It wasn't at all what I was looking for. Otherwise I guess it was fine.
5,Meditation CD,With patience anyone can learn to meditate. Jackie Haverty makes learning easier. She has a plesant voice and Paul Armatage's background music fits perfectly with Jackie's voice. She really did a good job putting this together.
2,"Pretty redundant, extra tracks are live tracks","If you already have Welcome to the Videos and were thinking ""Hey, this one has ""You Could Be Mine"" and a bunch of other tracks on it"" save your cash, all the extra tracks are from the Use Your Illusion Live In Tokyo DVDs. The animated menu is kinda cool, but, yeah it's not worth it."
3,Total Burn,"Installation is too nagging. If you have other software in that category, you may not be able to use it after installing total burn. Keep that in mind.Once on, it's nice. I used their dvd maker to learn how to use Pinnacle Studio 8.You can link avi's to make one big file, but it likes to keep the opening & ending fades. I'd use another program for that if you can. But I have had some good results with it.Making Data dvd isn't bad, just have the right dvd for your burner. Sometimes it's an issue with cd burners, but that's so common any longer, most house brands work. DVD's are a bit different.The make a label software is only good if you haven't anything else. If you Print Master or Shop, then you have a better program already.Oh, Total doesn't like Avery's After Burner software. Just a tip.Overall, for one package deal, it's worth thirty bucks, more or less."
4,"very good, but no 'hey whipple'","A very practical and inspiring guide to creating great ads. Not as good as Luke Sullivan's book, though."
5,A DEFINITE MUST-BUY!!!!,"Without question, you need to buy this CD immediately, so that you can have it completely memorized before ""Jawbreaker"" comes out. 19 Wheels is full of such talent. Their music is ROCK . . . energetic, fun, with an edge. You can't sit still when you listen to it.Also, be sure to catch them live when they come your way - they put on a great show . . . enjoyable to look at as well!! ;-)"
4,A Hard-to-put-down Suspense Book,"I thought this book was really good. We have 5 kids and experience a lot of the same situations as Elizabeth went through. I found her unwavering trust in her husband inspiring. The story never got dull and kept my interest right to the end. I've just ordered the sequel from the used side of Amazon. Far from being disappointed that this wasn't ""religious enough"", I found it very realistic as a real Christian living in a sinful world. Well done, Brian! Keep writing!"
3,Not what I expected,"I did not read the author's warning ahead of time and expected it to be a more ""religious book"". If that's what you're looking for DON""T read this. It's not going to be what you want. I'm not sure what I think of using the Christian faith as just an example of a coping mechanism, but the book wasn't bad. It didn't turn out as I'd thought, but overall I'd say the same to anyone interested that I do for most uncertain books. ""Try it. If you don't like it, don't finish it!"""
3,Great comfort but only good quality,I did extensive research on which socks would keep my feet warm in the winter. These do the job. They are very comfortable and always want to wear them in cold weather. The problem is they don't last. After only 4 months (Through Winter) they wore thin and this caused holes.
3,Great sock IF you have slender calves,"I absolutely loved these socks and desperately wanted to wear them, but the pair I received didn't have much stretch in the cuff and the top of the sock dug in uncomfortably. (I'm a Women's size 22. I gave them to my size 10 daughter and they fit her just fine.)(If you have a wider calf, try theThorlo Women's Thick Cushion Hiking Sockwithout wool. They're great for me in terms of fit and comfort and they're decently warm.)"
5,The best socks ever!,"Warm and thick and cushy, but they don't make my feet sweat. Highly recommended. My old pairs finally got worn through after years of washing."
5,Excellent quality at a very good price.,"Very satisfied with this purchase. Good quality at a decent price. I would highly recommend this to others. I have bought this product before, so I know the value is there and that the product will endure for a long time of washings."
3,size is tricky,"Ordered ""Size 11"" (men's) and got ""Medium"" which the sock package says is ""5.5-8.5 Men's"" and ""6.5-10 Women's"". Fortunately, they fit my wife. I'm trying again, nervously, and will order Size 13 to see if that produces ""Large"".Great socks, though. 5-star."
2,Really nice socks at the beginning...,"These socks are a nice color and felt great on my feet. Trouble is, you get hole after hole in a short time if you wear them often. Surprisingly, these socks are not very durable and do not warrant the rather steep price that Thorlo socks command. I think the Thorlo brand is vastly overrated. I'm going to try Wigwam's or Gold Toe socks next time."
5,A Masterpiece!,Noein will go down as one of the classics in Anime. It's stunning and breathtaking to look at. You'll have to catch your breath a couple of times watching this series! I'm not going to give any of the story away. But IMO if you like Science fiction you'll want to see Noein.The characters are powerful and charming and the dub cast is great!Noein is Anime at its finest!
3,Neutral review......,"it is a modern version of a classic Hindi grammar from the 1800s. It is important for its historical significance and its information on dialects and pronunciation would be of interest to many, however as a grammar to learn Hindi for a beginning student, this is not the book for you. Try something like Usha R. Jain's ""Introduction to Hindi Grammar"" or ""Hindi Primer"" by Michael C. Shapiro"
3,My Everything - 98 Degrees,"Australian Maxi Single Track Listing for -""MY EVERYTHING"" - 98 DEGREEES1) My Everything2) Give Me Just One Night (Una Noche) (Hex Hector Club Mix)3) Can You Imagine4) Never Let Go2000"
4,Excellent utility blade,This is the knife I've been looking for. For the cheap price this gives me both a regular folding blade and a utility razor that can be easily opened one-handed. It's too bad these are so hard to find.
2,not a comfy bra,The bra is very uncomfortable. The straps are non stretch and the dig into your shoulders. The cups are too pointy...not a good buy.
5,Incredible Story,"This is a must read!! Every parent should read this story to their children. I think the most incredible thing about this story was that - it was true!! It is so incredible how this little girl survived in the wilderness and how she was found after everybody searched everywhere and had giving up hope. A wonderful story, very touching, it will bring tears to your eyes so read with your Kleenex box by your side.The pictures in this book are incredible as well. Very well done and an excellent addition to make the story all the more real."
4,"Thought Provoking, Riveting","Anitov was hard to put down. The imagery throughout was excellent, making you feel a part of the novel. Mr. Deremer's approach to the tagedy of the Thresher gives you much food for thought. I look forward to reading more from this new author."
5,Dynamic & Compelling to read,"This thought provoking novel is a tribute to the gallant men who went down with the ""Thresher"". I found the book exciting from the moment I read the first page. It left me with many questions unanswered but I guess the truth will never be known. I am looking forward to Robert Deremer's next book; maybe a sequel?"
5,The second best megaman zero game yet!!!!!,"This game is very fun but at the same time pretty hard!!!!! Alot of cool new weapos including the knuckle fist, and the new chip system that lets you make zero strong. This game cool new bosses and if you are a fan of this series it has the famous Dr. Weil!!!!! I have personaly liked thuis game alot and it is not super expensive!!! If you loved the other games you'll love this one!"
1,Essentially a drug pushing book,"Duchaine is a criminal, served two federal prison sentences for drug dealing. Steroids have made Duchaine rich but at the cost of other peoples' lives. To get the real story about steroids, read Steroid Nation or the autobiography by Dan Clark aka Nitro from the Gladiator."
3,I found this entertaining,This book is a simple take on lovetypes. I found it to be entertaining to say the least and beyond that not much else intrigued me.
1,Generally trite and unnecessarily formulaic.,"Alexander Avila's prescription for those looking for love using the MBTI is fairly shallow. He tends to loosely outline only the very surface behaviors identified by the MBTI and pairs types without any consideration for a deeper purpose to life and relationships. I had the sense that if I planned to stay as I am for the rest of my life, cling tenaciously to the habits of thought and action I formed early on, and never search for any deeper spiritual experience, then the person this book recommends would suit me nicely and cause me the least irritation as I went about my static little life. If, on the other hand, I had a desire to grow and learn beyond behavioral reactions, if I wanted to be more in ten years, than I am today, then the person I would choose based on this book would have no idea what I was about or why they were stuck with me. Generally I found the book not very useful or realistic."
4,Great Group Book,"This book was great. We used it in a group setting...taking the test and then discussing each persons categorization and mate types. It was so fun and so hilarious! The categorizations were dead on, and the activity was a lot of fun. A great idea for parties or other group activities..."
1,Huge disappointment,"My 9 year old son was so excited to receive this great looking boat on Christmas morning. We charged it before use and he used it only once, then it did not work again. Tried recharging it - nothing...a cheap and nasty toy and total waste of money."
2,Fun to play with but not very durable. Water got inside the boat the second time I used it.,Fun to play with but not very durable. Water got inside the boat the second time I used it. The battery holder broke which caused the boat to not turn on after it pulled out the power line. Poor design.
1,Boat doesn't work,Boat will not run. Directions are very vague. Boat isn't any good if it won't run. No address of company on directions to send it back.
1,Great but no antenna,"I bought not 1 but 2 of these for my daughters to play with on our vacation. Easy set up,and they are sturdy. Was pleased until we got them in the water -- after going about 15 feet, the controls no longer worked. It seems that there must be an antenna problem since the boat works great up close but not at range. If this got fixed I would highly recommend the product but 15 feet isn't that great a distance. Maybe I missed attaching another antenna? Has anyone else had this problem?"
2,Fun for a Short while - Doesn't Last!,It was great boat for a little while. After the 6th Use I encountered a major problem. I went to plug the battery in and the motor immediately started spinning at full throttle. Which is very dangerous. The boat's switch was in the off position and the controller was off as well. One motor spins out of control. I have seen another review with the same issue. That said I'm waiting to see what the seller is willing to do. I will update when I get a response.
3,product replacement,"After my previous negative review, the company contacted me and replaced the product. The second boat worked well. Customer service individuals were very28"" VBlazingly Fastictory EP Racing Remote Controlled Boathelpful."
4,"Reviewed earlier as no response from Seller, but","seller contacted me regarding boat not working and now we are sending it back for exchange. Very pleased that seller responded and is working hard to rectify the situation. My husband LOVES this boat and when given the option to return it his answer was ""no,"" -- it truly is alot of fun and as stated earlier the battery life issue is easily rectified by buying a second battery. We really hope the second boat has a longer life since husband and son are looking forward to chasing the ducks."
2,Problematic Propeller,"We purchased this boat for our 5 year old sons birthday.. thought it would be a good starter boat for him. He was sooo excited about it. First time using the boat, the propeller dropped off. We fixed it and again it dropped off..again, and again. We spent more time diving for the propeller. We have yet to see the boat ""blaze"". Very disappointing.. I believe it will be a lovely knick-knack on his bedroom shelf. :0("
2,Arrived without the antenna for the remote & broke in 2 days,I could have purchased this from a store for the same price and returned it the same day when we discovered there was no antenna in the box. Now we're waiting an additional 10 days to get spare antenna because it works like crap without an antenna. ADDED AFTER RECEIVING ANTENNA: One of the two motors will not shut off - even when it's not in the water. This means you can only turn one way and cannot pause - EVER! Seems that this was a waste of money for us.
2,FUN....but choose a different boat,"Bought 2 different boats, this one and another. Both were banged up somewhat after the first time on the water, and both took on some water inside of the hull. This one, however, never recovered. Whenever the battery is plugged in, the propellers spin at full throttle on their own, even when the switch is in the OFF position. I cannot control it with the remote. I let it dry out for 6 days...even used a hairdryer and the problem is still present. I am disappointed because it was ALOT of fun...the ONE time it worked. I came back and bought a third boat just like the other one. Keeping my fingers crossed."
1,fast but dead,"Boat was great, at beginning. It's fast and fun, but within a few weeks, totally dead - stopped working, couldn't figure out why and returned."
4,Fun toy,Great fun! Its powerful and goes to unbelievable distances for such a small boat! Only downside is that the batteries only last about 10 - 15 minutes and also water gets inside so you have to dry the engine out every so often.
3,"Built cheap, but grandson loves it!","It is fast. Batteries last about 20 minutes. Decals don't stay on. Built cheap but what do you expect for a few bucks? As long as my grandson enjoys it, thats fine!"
3,Don't buy two,"Which is what I did thinking that my son can have fun racing with his friends. I got them very fast and they both work except, each boat does not have its own radio frequency. So, the two boats run from any one of the two controllers at the same time. There is no band width setting on either the controller or the boat. One more thing, every decoration on the boat is a sticker and every time the boat bangs to the pool walls, a piece of the decoration is gone. It is fast and fun but very limited. The instructions does not have the name of the company or any warranty statement, so I am using other reviewers information to find out whom I should call."
4,Great toy,"Great toy at a great price. Fast, stable, worked fine on a small pond and lake. One suggestion would be to buy a second battery. Like most RC vehicles the battery is only good for 10-15 minutes."
1,Do NOT order from Trendy Nation!,"My product has not arrived. Order was supposedly shipped a month ago! Seller will not return emails. Have filed a claim, and I hope Amazon will correct. Very disappointed!"
4,Lots of Fun,"Bought this for my 11 year old son's birthday - he loves it, rated it 4 out of 5 - Huge amounts of fun, now my husband wants one too! Battery life is pretty short, consider getting extra battery pack."
1,Not functional after 5 minutes. Incredibly poor customer service,"The boat started sputtering after 5 minutes of use and did not track straight. While the first 5 minutes (literally 5 minutes) was fun, nothing but frustration after that.The customer service (RC Toys) was the absolute rudest I've ever encountered. The e-mails they sent were completely out of line and quite shocking. I requested a return and will file a claim with Amazon if the company does not allow it.I certainly do not recommend this boat or RC Toys!"
1,"28"" Blazingly Fast Victory EP Racing Remote Controlled Boat","This product is not worth the money. It was missing the anteanna on the remote and the sodering inside the boat is real weak. My grandson got to use it 5 minutes in the water.I dont suggest buying this product.28"" Blazingly Fast Victory EP Racing Remote Controlled Boat"
3,Fast and Fun Victory EP Racing Remote Controlled Boat,The only down fall is the battery...it only last about 10 minutes fully charged. I bought a back up thankfully.
1,No seller response,"This was a xmas gift I purchased and it arrived on time and packaged properly. This boat might have been a good product if you could keep it running. After all proper charging and battery replacements, the boat would only run for less than 3 minutes. I tried contacting the seller (Funtoys) to get a replacement, per Amazon's instructions, and only got an answering machine and no response. After numerous phone attempts I sent them an email via Amazon and still no response. Fortunately Amazon came through and refunded the entire purchase price - kudo's to Amazon. Bah Humbug to Funtoys!"
4,Fun but has flaws,"I bought this for my 6 year old son's birthday - he loves it. Boat is cheaply built but works real well. Supervision is definitely required. During the first use, one motor stayed on continuously even with the power switch turned off. I contacted A Xheli and they said it probably just needed to dry out internally. We let it dry out and tried it again and it works fine. Now I'm just more mindful about letting water get inside. The other reviews about short battery life are correct - it's about 10 minutes. I'm glad I bought an extra battery. Would definitely recommend it for the price."
3,works well,"I purchased this for my grandson, and when he opened it, the front of the boat was cracked. It looked as if it had been used and sold for new. He was so excited by the boat, he did not want me to send it back. It runs very well and my only complaint was the condition."
4,remote control boat,The store I bought the boat from didn't sell parts when we had a problem. So they sent an entirely new boat. I didn't even ask for it. Fine people. Happy grandson.
4,Good Fun but needs lots of space,"I bought this boat for my grand children to use in the swimming pool. The boat is simple to get up and running and seems well made. However, it is too much boat for a swimming pool, it needs open water. It is amazingly fast and therefore difficult to control in an in ground swimming pool, barely enough space to turn. I finally got good enough at maneuvering that I could make it do a figure eight in the pool (do not run with people in the pool!). As for durability it rammed into the side of the pool several times at full speed, and, lots of times scraping the side of the pool (tearing up the decals) and kept on running! A better boat for a pool is the 21"" R/C Super Police Boat."
3,Fun but broke quickly,"We loved this toy. My ten year old son is on his 2nd one / 2nd season. Bought the 2nd one and had the same issue with it breaking. It got to a point where the propellers were stuck in the ""on"" position - full blast. When this happens there is no steering and nothing I could do can take it out of this mode. Last time it happened it went screaming towards a group of kids swimming. Scared the heck out of me but it veered off and ran into a pontoon boat that was parked. If this had hit a kid the boat or propellers would have caused some serious damage. Propellers are turning at a very high rate speed.Going to order yet another one and hopefully it will last."
2,lasted 3 rides,"Purchased boat for Christmas Present, which worked for 3 days. On the third day, the engine will not turn off and is unresponsive to the remote control. Components are of cheap quality and glued in place so repair is not possible. Screw on tabs holding propellors onto shaft were loose (oversized), and fell off on first use. Don't expect more than a week or two of great fun with this boat."
1,Don't buy,I do not recommend this product to anyone. The plastic is low quality and the electronics are even lower in quality. The first time we put it in water it went around in circles on it's on. We had already disposed of the box so were not able to return. When I opened the control box I noticed the electronic board was very poorly built with no parts available for repair. Don't waste your money.
4,Good book if you are starting an on-line business,"I found this book to be very unbiased and helpful in learning how to start an on-line business. Very straight forward, with lots of great resources. The book is very specific to starting retail on-line businesses, so don't be suprised if it does not cover your specific business plan. Great resources, easy to peruse and to find information at-a-glance. I would highly recommend it to anyone starting an on-line business..."
5,,AWESOME! Fantastic it explains the exact dynamic of a relationship and how to live your life as a man that knows what he wants and stands by it!
3,A few good techniques,"Overall i enjoyed reading this book. I think that the author did a great job detailing the different types of women and how to identify what their intentions were. That being said, I feel that for the most part this book outlined what not to do.. it did not give many pointers on ways to approach a women or carry out a conversation."
2,The usual gender dividing herd politics...,"An average book filled with all the stereotypes of both women and men that you can read for free on any man-bashing / woman-bashing messageboard. Admittedly, it's actually an entertaining read with the core message of the book being that having loads of confidence is necessary when engaging any member of the homo sapien race.The book is brought low by its juvenile insistences that both genders fit into a sparse selection of 2-dimensional cartoon character descriptions as well as its adherence to a played-out, pimp-style POV that material goods make the man. Come on now, the only clothing a true mack wears are made of leather, mink, silk, suede or chinchilla? Guess you can't be environmentally conscious and a mack too. More evidence of the silly hood-type mentality that ultimately holds Blacks back while the rest of society tries to move forward.This book is not recommended for the individual thinker.Two stars for the entertainment value."
4,A Good Read,"My husband read this and really enjoyed it. Some may think this book at aimed at ""players,"" but really it's a confidence booster. This book basically breaks down how to talk to females and not make a fool of yourself."
5,ISM,"This book is for anyone tryna step their game up. In order for you to have the women of your choice and be like you want them to be and last you have to be right first. Everything in this book is fact, And what's crazy about it is as old as this book is the message and ism he lays down is still relevant today. EVERY MAN should have this book, especially if your single mom raised you. King Flex has the game and gone with it and I plan on getting some of his other works as well."
5,This will give you the skills needed to be fully prepared to maximize your game to the fullest potential!,"In order for a football team to reach its maximum capability, the coach must get the best out of your ability. In order to do that, one must teach his players skills.Thats what Mr. Nasheed is doing. He's laying down all the rules of the game, and with skills applied, one can reach his full potential."
5,Even Better Than The Art Of Mackin,I was a big fan of Tariq's first book the Art Of Mackin when it came out 5 years ago..I didn't think he could top that book..But yet he did it with The Mack Within. This book is basiacally an extension of the Art Of Mackin. The info in the Mack Within is DEEP..I really like how he teaches men to value themselves.And the list of Women You Should Not Mack To is classic...The game isn't for the faint of heart.
2,"Hard to ""get into""","This book is hard to understand and really get into the crux of it all. I have not finished it, because it was rather arcane. I feel the author was too nebulous in writing about the ""interior"" rooms of the spirit/soul. I wished to know what specific steps were taken as one entered into each room and what the different possible feelings/outcomes could be for people other than Teresa."
4,Best Gundam series but worst DVD release,"This is the most anticipated Gundam series released in North America and yet Bandai has put together one of the worst DVD releases. The biggest problem is that Bandai has replaced the original OP/ED songs without informing the fans ahead of time. To anime otaku's, changing the OP/ED is like raping their show. Fans pre-ordered the DVD box set, waited for its release and finally popped disc 1 into their DVD player, and then only to find out that the OP song was replaced by another piece of music. Had Bandai been more forthcoming, this DVD release would not be as worst as fans put it.Apart from the changed OP/ED, the DVD box set is a rather solid release, consisting of 10 volumes in thinpaks housed within a shiny collector's box. The box set also includes a 48-page booklet and 9 collectible action figure pencil sharpeners."
5,You have to be a true Gundam fan to buy this set,"Zeta Gundam! A true jewel! This is the direct sequel to Mobile Suit Gundam and its three movies. The animation is dark and gloomy, yet spectacular. The story line pulls you in, but you must have a fairly good amount of knowledge of the original Gundam to fully get the story."
2,Falls disappointingly short,"I found this book a bit pretentious with its L.A. dwelling main character and her proclivities for designer clothing. The middle of the book was excellent and touching as Dora develops a relationship with Bea and Harper. The ending disappointed, though, so that I was left with an overall feeling of ambivalence toward the book. Had the entire book been as heartfelt and tender as the middle section, this book would have merited five stars for sure."
4,Very good for a First Novel,"The authors had an interesting plot, and it was told with much humor. I enjoyed the book, and it was rather a ""quick read""."
2,somewhat excessive,"Not a page turner. Felt like authors were name dropping by listing so many other books and authors. I chose the book to read because I like to read and pretty much lived my younger life lost in books. I wanted to see if I identified with the character; I did not, because of the extensive details about sex and the desire for sex. This book is not one I would recommend to my book club."
2,Reads like a rough draft,"""I collect new books the way my girlfriends buy designer handbags.""Despite a main character who could be construed as a kindred spirit, this book disappointed me. The blurb on the back described the plot as that of a woman who deals with the problems of her life by going on a book reading binge. Okay. Excellent strategy. And the authors (Why are there two? Two authors concerns me.) tossed into the story every wonderful book title, every wonderful book quote, every wonderful author...but it wasn't enough.A stew of things obsessive readers love, but it wasn't enough. The book still read like a rough draft. Disappointing."
3,Fun read for an Angeleno,"Maybe others would enjoy it too -- it is particularly descriptive of the intellectual vacuousness of Southern California. The characters were far-fetched. A film mogul who can't fall out of love with his very eccentric wife, panic attacks and all? Ah, if you say so. And there were too many book references, it often felt self-conscious. But it was a lot of fun, and if you enjoyed ""A Year in Van Nuys,"" and long to sink deeply once again into a bubble bath of neuroses, you ought to give this one a read."
1,Ridiculous,"The best thing about this book is its sleek, sexy cover. It all goes south fast from there. The premise, that reading is wonderful, certainly doesn't come through in this effort. The plot is insipid; worse than a bad daytime soap. Listing & quoting great works of art does not a novel make. If the authors love reading so much, they should stick to it & give up the writing. It would do us all a favor. Clearly a vanity book; definitely not worth your time and money."
2,Not for Literati,"This book was sub par. It was funny some times, but I felt the plot was weak and the character kind of annoyed me. A good summer beach read, but not one that will keep you turning the pages. Kaufman and Mack's second book, ""A Version of the Truth"" is much better.A Version of the Truth (Bantam Discovery)"
3,I Longed for More,"The literary references redeem this book to some extent but sometimes feel forced as if the authors had a notebook filled with literary quotes and shaped the plot around them so as to get in as many as possible. That being said, without the literary references and the bibliomania of the protagonist I would not have liked this book at all. This book is perfect for a quick read in the bathtub, on a plane or at the beach. Read Jasper Fforde's 'The Eyre Affair' series for books written for true book lovers."
1,Just okay,"The literary angle is a good hook, but this slender book (like most chick lit) still wants to have it all ways. The relationship that the protagonist ends up with involves no real effort of her own other than the genre's need to provide a hunky man (preferably with a pot of gold) at the end of these types of books. The stuff set in the bookstore is the best (esp. if you're an Angeleno who knows the real store), but it seemed weird that a woman who spent so much time reading great works of literature still ended up so shallow, at least on the page."
2,"The product itself is amazing, but my reconditioned gun did not function.",The title just about says it all. I received my reconditioned Bostitch RN46 and tried it out the same day. Sadly it did not fire at all. My guess is that there was something wrong with the firing mechanism. I had this exchanged through a third party and the new gun was amazing. With four guys and one gun we couldn't lay the shingles as fast and the gun could nail them down. I will never roof without a nail gun again. -If- the gun works this is a great deal at $135.
1,Don't waste your time and money,"I've had good luck in the past with reconditioned products-- half the power/air tools I use were purchased reconditioned/refurbished. But this nailer is not to be trusted. The first one wouldn't fire a single nail. No pressure through the piston. The replacement that Amazon provided me (at no cost to me at all, thank you Amazon) fired ONE SINGLE NAIL, then started blowing by exactly like the first one. I know it's not my equipment, I had to use a rental DeWalt nailer for the past week while trying to sort this out, and it worked flawlessly every day, despite looking exactly like what you'd expect a rental nailer to look like: that is, beat to hell.Don't be afraid to buy reconditioned, just stay as far away from this nailer as you possibly can. A good start would be to not buy it in the first place."
2,Reconditioned not as good as new,"Had hoped this would work trouble free, but it didn't. Half way through the job, this gun failed to work correctly. Had to spend an hr or so repairing it. Finally finished the job, but it was frustrating for this gun to not work properly."
5,Great nail gun,I already own a different Bostitch nailer and it has never failed me. So far this gun is perfect. No miss fires.
1,DON'T BE CHEAP LIKE ME!!!!! BUY NEW!!,"Only a fool like me would buy this, wait for the day I need it to use it, and then it doesn't work. PLEASE read below. I have friends who bought this nailer NEW and they work wonderful, being the money savy person I thought I am, I bought a refurb model thinking Bostitch is a respectable brand and can be trusted. WRONG so WRONG. This thing fired 5 nails and after that the plunger stopped working properly. I was stuck on a job with 5 people and only 2 guns instead of 3, sure is nice to pay per hour while one of the guys are hand nailing shingles!!!!! Just buy new and be rest assured you have a good product. If I was Amazon, I wouldn't have crap like this available to my customers......."
3,Had to return for repair,The nail gun quit working after using it for about an hour. I returned it to Bostitch and they repaired it. It seems to work ok now. I will not use it until the weather warms up enough to do roofing. I was ou tcost to ship the gun to bostitch.
3,(Not) Reconditioned Bostitch U/RN46 roofing nailer,"Haven't had a chance to actually use this tool, but it wasn't in what I considered 'reconditioned' condition. Paint was worn in several areas, and there was obvious wear on the tip of the nailer. I'd consider it 'used, fair condition', not 'reconditioned'. Remains to be seen how it functions..."
4,Bostitch tools are of high quality,"Bostitch tools have always been made to high standareds. Even though I haven't used the nailer yet, I know it will preform as I expect it to."
1,Factory-Reconditioned Bostitch U/RN46-1 3/4-Inch to 1-3/4-Inch Coil Roofing Nailer,"Neither of these guns worked from the getgo. I have orderd a lot of reconditioned items, and some do come to me already busted, but you gotta expect some people to cheat ya when they know the product does not work and they can get away with just saying its reconditioned. Also after I bought these guns I have NEVER AGAIN Bought any reconditioned item. Learned my lesson from these clowns."
4,Used them with good results,"Within the last year my brother and I replaced two roofs. I was hesitant to buy reconditioned tools but wanted to save money. After all we only needed the nailers for a couple of jobs. I bought two of them and they worked beautifully until half way through the 2nd roof when one began to not fire. I believe it is the O ring that needs to be replaced and the chamber cleaned. Should be a simple fix, but since we had to get the roof done quickly I bought a third one to finish the roof. The nailers themselves whether new or reconditioned are good. They are easy to use, load and adjust and were reliable for most of the time. I'm not sure having had to buy a third one that I shouldn't have just bought them new. However, a new one could have had the same problem after some use as well. All in all I'm pleased with my purchase."
1,the tool is worthless,I bought this tool in june 2010 and I could not use it until june 2011. It would not fire one nail. It's great to have somebody to show up to help and have to go rent something that actually worked. Of course the warranty is long past. Don't buy this product.
2,A Little Mediocre,"After the impressive 1995 Firin in Fouta, this recording has little flare. It is less African at heart and more Western pop. It is thorough let down. Firin in Fouta with its rich texture of Senegalese rhythms and Western soul and dance, perhaps, set a standard too high for Baaba Maal."
3,Okay,Baaba Maal is arguably one of the greatest African vocalists ever to acheive international renown. Here on this collaborative album of bland pop and Celtic fusions. His distinct brilliance becomes submerged to lesser singers and you want to throw the CD against the wall in frustration. This does not mean the album is bad compared to lesser mortals this would be a great album and you still get the incredible Fulani melodies flowing through especially with his more successful reggae fusions. It is just that this album has allowed the other performers rather mediocre sound to dominate Baaba Maals on several songs. I would still recommend this CD because it has diversity but for Baaba Maal purists this will be a thorn in the side
2,Baaba Maal needs new management,"Whatever record producer came up with the idea to add guest vocalists to an album by one of the world's most gifted vocalists should be fired. I completely respect world / African artists trying to break into Western mainstream, but this isn't how to do it. As others have written the production is thick, choked full of synths and layers of vocalists piled upon Maal's voice. One wishes everyone would just shut up and let Maal sing. It leads me back to 'Call to Prayer' everytime."
2,Peanut quality is questionable,"Despite the bad comments from the previous reviewer, I ordered my first bag of 50lb peanuts bits in Oct/2008 because of the low price. I must had been lucky to receive a good bag of peanuts the 1st time of ordering. Didn't get any of the miscellaneous nuts like the last reviewer describe.In Jan/2009, I came back to Amazon.com to re-order my 2nd 50lb bag. What a disappointment! This new 50lb contains non-quality peanuts and also have some almonds, woodchips... etc mixed in it. It's truly opposite quality of what I received before.My experience of this product has been 50%good/50%bad. Hence, I rated it two stars. Not sure if I'll re-order the 3rd time (it depends if the price is still reasonable). Time will tell."
5,can you imagine?,"elliott or iain? Why not both? Neither will disappoint and both will help you to get through the day. Believe me, they have been there and the collective wisdom shared on this album is overwhelmingly good! Elliott has kept his hand in, touring incessantly, while Iain has kept a lower profile. Now, the two have determined it is time to release this passionate opus and let the listener know that all is well and that the road never ends. Enjoy the ride!"
3,"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: ""JUNIOR'S AT THE JUKE JOINT!""","This CD by Junior is a pure middle of the road ""juke-joint"" level blues CD. It's not bad, and it isn't great. There are 13 songs. (2 songs are under 3 minutes, 5 are under 4 minutes). Remember what Shaq, ""The King Of The World Blues Reviewer"" always says: ""You can't get the blues in 2-3 minutes!"". I think the best part of this CD, is the name of his drummer. Kenny ""Beedy Eyes"" Smith. Hoo! Haa!"
2,Lundberg rice cakes,I had great expectations when I ordered these rices cakes. Received my box today and tried a cake right away. I think my tongue is dead because I could not taste the buttery caramel flavoring that was supposed to be on these cakes. There was a coating but not enough flavor. This part breaks my heart to write. I held off ordering the rice cakes so they would not be shipped in the middle of winter and ordered them now so they would not be shipped during our rainy season. I did not want stale rice cakes. My strategy did not work. The one cake I tried was almost stale but still edible. I put it in a toaster oven to dry it out a bit and that helped though the coating got tough. Went ahead and ordered storage containers from Amazon. Will give an update on whether storing the cakes makes a difference.
5,Very informative,"John Sorenson doesn't make wild speculations in this book - he simply breaks down the information available in the Book of Mormon and, along with common sense, lays out how populations, geography, waterways and people all impacted on the events in the Book of Mormon.This book has definitely increased my understanding of and appreciation for the Book of Mormon - it's well worth a look."
2,Dislike Vocal,"I gave my cd away. Too bad it couldn't keep me interested after a few plays. Everytime I heard Robin Fox's voice, it made me sick to my stomach. She really seem to have a problem letting her voice out and she sounded in agony.I think if they leave her out and make the cd more instrumental then many people will come to like it. That's what attracted me at the first place. I can now see why it's taking Robin Fox along time to have a new album release. Everyone knows that you can't last forever with a computerized voice (I recommend Fragma, DJ Enjore with Engelina, and 4 Strings if you're looking for some trance music with vocals)."
3,Not too bad....not too great....,"In short this cd has a few good songs, and more bad songs. The only songs worth listening to if you truly love music are Freedom, I See Stars, Wonderland and It's Gonna Be Ok. Other than those songs, this cd is not that good at all. And yes i agree this cd is dance pop and her tampered voice is horrible on some of these tracks. To call some of these songs trance would be like calling Justin Timberlake's music trance. But if you have the extra cash to blow on something decent instead of something good then get this cd, if not you know where the new releases are."
1,Pure garbage,"Don't be fooled by the title...this is NOT a trance album. It's dance pop. And for someone who claims to be a better singer than the rest, she seems to have a problem with actually using it. Her actual singing voice very rarely appears on this record. It's all masked behind highly over used vocodor, and the end result has her sounding like a moronic robot singling simple lyrics with no meaning or depth. Lyrics that a 1 year old could have written. Same verse repeated 2 to 3 times and the chorus. ...i rate this album negative 5 stars"
1,not what i expected,"cd makes a cool coaster in my game room. this cd is beyond terrible. the lyrics were dumb and boring, the vocals were very altered and nothing speciial and the music was just...! what the record lable was thinking when they signed this i dont know, but i see they havent released anything else by her so hopefully they got wise."
5,Excellent,I love Robin Fox's CD. The tracks are very catchy and moving. It is a dance CD. Anyone who does not like this CD was probably looking for heavy metal or folk music. When it comes to dance music this CD just raised the bar. I look forward to Robin Fox's next CD.
2,Dislike Vocal,"I gave my cd away. Too bad it couldn't keep me interested after a few plays. Everytime I heard Robin Fox's voice, it made me sick to my stomach. She really seem to have a problem letting her voice out and she sounded in agony.I think if they leave her out and make the cd more instrumental then many people will come to like it. That's what attracted me at the first place. I can now see why it's taking Robin Fox along time to have a new album release. Everyone knows you can't last with a computerized voice (I recommend Fragma, DJ Encore with Engelina, or 4 Strings if you're looking for some trance music with vocals)."
2,desert storm ?,"I like Mr Johnstone's books about the ashes series but in this one I found two areas he should of refered to his earlier books. One was when Dr. Buck took over for Dr. Chase , in refering to Dr. Chase's age as in the 60's and also he referes to the Gulf War. THis took place in the early 90's when the USA was suposed to be down and out and the SUSA had not started. Whose army fought this war ?"
4,Finally back on track,"After the last few books in this series I thought that Mr. Johnstone was getting tired of this series, the stories were draging on and on. But after this book I think that he has gotten his second wind for this series. this book has a lot of the old style of writing I enjoyed in the series when I started reading it years ago, lots of action and suspense. The book is the next one in the story of Osterman and her plans to get rid of Ben Raines and the S.U.S.A. and the lengths she will go to to get her way. the fighting is in the style of books in the series like Valor in the Ashes and others of that time."
2,New or Old,"I have read many of the books in this series, however, I never know if this is a new release or a re-release. I have purchased books that I had read several years ago thinking it was a new release. It would be great if Amason would let us know when a book is new or a re-release."
2,Same Same,"Well from some one who has read 90% of William W. I'm disappointed. Following the series the series Ben is a Nam Vet, D-Day he is mid 40's, he has to be in his late 60's . Same Same Cecil amd Lamar. Dick Clark or what? William W seems to be getting sick of this series,thats cool, it's to bad, good series. I would like to see follow ups on some books like Last of Dog Team, Prey/Hunted, First Mtn Man and some of his other 1-2 book runs. I love his stuff agree with most of his philosiphy and wonder if maybe William W is Ben raines ???? William W. we hard core fans need fresh material."
5,Warriors from the ashes,What can I say. Another one of WIlliam W. Johnstone's Ashes books. I love the Ashes series. And this one is great too.
1,Not suitable for Kindle,It is simply not readable in black&white and the drawings are not adapted to one single page....a waste of money!
1,Never got product?,"Odd because I got one product from seller but not another and was very satisfied. I ordered at the same time and the sent the first package and the second package never came and was delivered but returned for ""inadequate address."""
5,Find your way to shine,"Again, this is designed for children, but I believe it is for anyone that is looking for that extra little boost to be inspired to do the things we love to do. We all have that child inside us."
3,Getting it right authors get it right,A focus of the book is the need to involve teens in all areas of the process of creating library services. As a result this book acts as a plea to librarians to realize the value and necessity of youth participation in everything that they do.
1,Worthless,"These are the most worthless piece of junk ever. They are supposed to be razors, but do not begin to shave even one eyebrow hair. I bought three packs and threw them out. Would have cost more to return than I paid for them. They are cheap, but it is still a waste of your money."
3,Too sharp for me!,"Worked great, a little too great. I cut myself too many times with this one-not a good fit for me."
2,Not a very high quality product,This did absolutely nothing for me other than giving me a rash. The blade is awkward and thick and does all most nothing as far as unwanted hair goes. It dulled after one use and left me with little scratches and red patches from trying so hard to get rid of my facial hairs. I would not use it again nor recommend this to a friend.
3,Not What I Remembered,"I purchased these a few years ago at a dollar store and loved them. When I went to buy more later, I couldn't find them anywhere. I purchased many other brands, trying to find one that measured up to noxema but they all seemed dull the very first time I took them out of the pack and used them. I was elated to find these eyebrow shapers online. But when I got them, I was disappointed to find that they were not as good as I remembered them. However, they are a huge improvement over the others I have used."
4,"Good product, Great price","Not much to say about these shapers. They do what they supposed to do, and are a much better quality than generics."
3,They do the job,"These aren't really mini razors like you'd use for shaving. They're really more like tiny knives with a few wires over them so you don't slice your eyebrow. I found these hard to use. Going with the grain, they don't cut the hair very well, and going against, they still don't cut very well. You'll have to run over areas many times before they're bare. Also, I hope you have a gel or something to use with these, because they'll give you razor burn if you use them dry. The problem with this is that they make them even less effective.One of mine also broke somehow, even though it was just sitting in a drawer. I super glued it back together.I like that they come with a cap though, and they're nice looking."
3,Works well,"Not the best blade (incomparison to a regular razor) but it gets the job done if you work at it. Takes a little longer than a regular razor, sometimes repeated swipes but it can get under the eyebrow better. Less risk of shaving off what you want to keep!"
4,works as expected,"This works just as I hoped. It is small, lightweight and has protective covers for when not in use. It is sharp so you have to be careful not to cut yourself, but you really wouldn't want it to be dull, right?"
3,"Noxzema Eyebrow Shaper, 3-pack","Noxzema Eyebrow Shaper, 3-pack it was okay but I felt it was not smooth enough for me and was a bit little for me will have to find a better shaper"
5,Can't live without!,"I have been using these for 7 years and my local Family Dollar store stopped carrying this exact brand. These are the only brand that are easy to hold, control, and shave without scratching your skin."
2,No e-Filing Rebate = No TurboTax Customer,I have relatively simple taxes but want to e-file. In the past I bought Turbo Tax so I could e-file. Now I have to pay for TurboTax + e-Filing Fees + tax + shipping. It costs nothing for TurboTax to e-file so this is a source of additional revenue for them. They lost one customer.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"I have used turbo tax since 2003 and it has never let me down until now. I made it through the entire process and now can't file because Turbo Tax doesn't have software updates from the IRS ""because of Hurricane Katrina"" according to one of their reps. The update won't be on the system until 2/17/06. I could file by hand long before then.They offered a refund but the price of insured shipping to South Carolina would cost me as much as my refund. I will NEVER trust Intuit again. According to the IRS, the updates were available on 12/6/2005. Why is it taking them over 2 months to provide these updates?"
1,Tank Your Taxes,"This software is always eager to sell you supplements and additional software. However, there are few insights for people who just want a quick and easy way to prepare their taxes. Turbo Tax seems to add additional fees for every step of the process. There is even a charge for most help functions if you need to contact a company representative. The state software is also extremely difficult to download. Unless you have used Turbo tax in the past and are familiar with its constant pop-ups trying to hype/sell other software then I would avoid this software."
1,Don't buy Turbo Tax Basic 2005 for Mac,"If you want to do your taxes before Feb 17 2006 this is not the product for you since Turbo Tax will not have all the forms available. Oh, by the way, you will have to pay tech support money to get this piece of information. I will be using TaxCut next year."
2,TurboTax lost another faithful customer,The program does a great job in figuring my taxes. But now Intuit is charging for filing and the state program. Also I was unable to download the updates over my dial-up connection. I called to have a CD version mailed to me but so far I haven't received it. I'm trying Tax Act this year. It is a free program and has free filing. IF I can complete the TurboTax version I will see if I can duplicate my return using Tax Act. If so then good bye TurboTax.
2,Mac Version... 2 Thumbs down!!!,"This was my first time to ever attempt using a software program to file my taxes. TurboTax sounded easy enough. And it was pretty easy at first. The software interviewed me in an efficent manner and saved all of my information. But the final tax forms I needed to file with were not included on the CD-ROM package. TurboTax instructed me to get them by using ""one-click update."" Well after I update and attempt to restart the software, TurboTax refuses to come up at all. I can't speak for this software on Windows machines. But if you are using Mac OS X, I suggest you explore other options first."
2,Not so much...,I am addicted to Roller Coaster Tycoon so have been trying out the other tycoon games. This one is the first disappointment. Too little interactions during the sell phase make it a guess and see type of game. Oh Well. My 5 year old nephew likes it....
4,Fun way to pass time.,"This game is fun and funny. The story line and little side comments are very cute. There is enough of a challenge to make it interesting, but it is also easy, simple and sweet. Nothing stressful, just a pleasant way to pass the time with a game that is fairly simple, but not so simple as to be boring.I enjoyed it."
4,These helped me considerably,"Before i got these pans my oven baked things unevenly and many sensitive dishes were ruined. The airbake makes the baking even on the bottom which helped a lot. Now puff pastry comes out nearly perfectly. And it's a nice size too.Cleaning these dark pans takes a moment (like any dark pans), as baked on grease is felt more easily than it is seen. Also, it is lightweight, so it bends easily. That means taking it from a hot oven to cold water will warp it slightly. But it can be bent back and used well.Overall, these sheets helped me a lot and i wonder if i could even bake some dishes without them."
3,weak,"this pump is surprisingly low quality construction, but i can't knock it too hard because while it looks like it's going to pop at the crappy banded seams any moment, it hasn't yet, and i've used it maybe 25 times to inflate a dingy. i may just be lucky. or maybe the pump is a sleeper...the crappy looking car in the bad neighborhood that actually runs fine, but no one bothers it because it looks like crap...i dunno. make your own choices, don't be cheap."
2,Fabric Ripped First Time Out,"On the PLUS side: Not a bad bellows, works well and has a nifty little closure clip right on the hose; you can't lose it. Comes with several nozzles and adaptors. On the MINUS side: the edge of the bellows fabric ripped the first time I used it. A bit of duct tape and we were good to go again. You shouldn't have to repair a new piece of equipment - but honestly, it was easier to slap on a bit of tape rather than box it up and send it back - and hunt for a new footpump."
5,Does the job,"Decent construction and capacity gets the job done with relatively fewer pumps. For larger matresses, it takes a bit, but this is what you want if you don't have electricity. My campmates are always borrowing mine."
4,learn your history,"Ok just because a bands lacks double bass, that doesn't mean they aren't hardcore. The last 3 Agnostic Front albums are hardcore. They are real hardcore. They aren't metalcore or any of that crap.Some old school hardcore includes Bad Relgion and Minor Threat."
4,Warm and relaxing,"I've listened to almost all of the Putumayo CDs and own more than a few. They've been instrumental in introducing me to all sorts of world artists. Unfortunately, with many of the CDs I end up really liking about 25% of the songs and wishing I could discard the rest. This was NOT the case with Gardens of Eden, though. The whole album is enjoyable and lulls you into a sense of well-being and peace. Recommended."
2,"Some decent music, idiotic lyrics","The first song, Homecoming Weekend in a Small Town, is quite good. It's catchy, with hooky lyrics and a great overall sound. Kind of a Postal Service/Go Find kind of vibe - but without the smart lyrics. And boy, in the rest of the album you really really notice the absence of those smart lyrics. Wow. Plus, the tones and beats also seem to suffer from a lack of imagination. I don't want to overstate this though as the music is nonetheless fairly nice. It's just that, coupled with the juvenile lyrics, one can't help but take away an overall impression of this album as being an (awkward) adolescent effort. I'd still probably recommend this album on the strength of the first song, but don't get your hopes up for the rest of this one."
3,Convoluted plot,"The murder(s) that take place in this novel are all ""off screen"". We only learn about them bit by bit through the narrative of Detective Cuddy. He does a truly Columbo-like job of interviewing and re-interviewing witnesses. In the end the explanation for what happens seems a bit of a stretch.Also, the characters lack depth and Cuddy's own romance fails to take flight.I give this effort a moderate to good rating. Worth reading, but not enough to make me really want to pick up another Healy book."
2,Way too small,"This serving set fell below my expectations because the pieces are too small. I bought it mainly because of its tart server which turned out with a serving surface shorter than 2.5"". If I had read the dimensions/descriptions more carefully before purchasing this set I would have noticed that it was a ""tart server"" and not a ""cake server"" (latter would be bigger). The pieces were also not of a good weight and didn't have the finish one would expect of this price."
1,"Too general,,,book of revelation better...","The final warning is too general, like getting a psychic reading she tells me things i already know, climate change, political revolutional, economic disasters and supposed revelations from an apparition (fatima) that re-tell the book of revelation, daniel and isaiah...never the less i give her some credit for bringing additional interest to the need of entire nations and peoples' need to change their ways or face judgement as never before witnessed..."
1,Really a big letdown.,"I, too, feel I must chime in and express my disappointment in this book. The subject matter is fascinating; I've been interested in End Times prophecy for quite some time. After hearing Kathleen on Art Bell's show, I ordered the book eagerly. There were some major delays with the book's arrival, but that's another matter.The writing is of poor quality. The book's production values seem to be not quite up to par. The fact that so much of the book was based on the Lueken work was the most shocking part of it all. The supply list in the back of the book smacked of hucksterism.I, too, am sorry I bought this book, and urge those who are interested in this sort of material to look elsewhere, starting with Father Malachi Martin's books. Fr. Martin's books will stand the test of time; this book will not."
1,Not much of a revelation.,"Lots of ""fuzzy math"" and typos. This book has a few interesting concepts but nothing to become inspired about.If your looking for a good ""end times"" novel there are many better reads on the market. This book makes some incredibly illogical assumptions. A good sci-fi short story but certainly not an addendum to your Bible."
1,Horrible Lies,"NO STARS-Anyone who would believe this garbage is either naive or stupid. The pictures are several decades old and the lies she tells about internment camps should put her in jail. The publisher lost ten million dollars in a lawsuit against his former company, because he defrauds the authors, who pay for him to publish them. The author has no real credentials as an investigative journalist; anyone could call themselves that. The whold thing is trumped up in order to sell ""survival"" items. Full of Catholic paranoia; none of it is true. Pure fiction."
1,Good for a laugh,The final warning seems to be that god is going to send a comet to earth to destroy all those who don't believe. However you will be safe as long as you are a true believer. You will be safe from earthquakes if you sprinkle holy oil around your door. You will be able to drink the contaminated water as long as you put some drops of holy water in it. She even conveniently puts a form at the back of the book so you can buy all the holy things you are going to need to survive. The author's evidence is mainly from visionary's and the bible. The rest is all spectulation on her part. Some parts of the book were very amusing however.
4,The Final Warning,"When I first read this book six months ago, I thought Kathy was way out there! Now, just watch CNN and you know she is on tosomething."
5,Intense,"Great reading experience. I'm sharing it with my study group and we're finding lots of new things that we have never heard about. After 15 years of interest in this topic, that came as a great surprise. I particularly liked the way Keating approached her readers in the book. Very friendly, and very profound. I'm going to keep this book on my bedstand and keep re-reading. I don't want to miss a thing!"
5,Earth shattering!,Kudos to Ms. Keating on this spectacular book! It's obvious that a lot of research went into it and that she took a lot of time to bring all of it together for us. This has just got to make the best-seller list. It deserves to be number one!
5,Moving,"I was taken so much by this book. It explains why evil is making such a push against good people. It is obvious to me after reading what other people have said here that the two sides are opposing each other, good and evil. I received so much joy from this book that I know that it is good.Oh my, the news in this book is troubling, but we need to know."
1,Shoddy research,"I had the displeasure of reading this book in it's entirety this week. There wasn't any new information here at all. The ""research"" consists of stories that can be found on any conspiracy web site on the Internet. Saying that I'm not impressed is about the nicest thing I can say...This book is a major disappointment. The same information can be found anywhere on the Internet, and requires no special research. Some of the information...should be viewed with a very discerning eye.Very disappointing!"
2,Disappointment,"I was interested in reading Ms. Keating's book after hearing her on Art Bell's Coast to Coast. I was very disappointed when I received the book in the mail. There are absolutely no footnotes or references, although the author makes constant reference to things that are happening in the government, in the military, in the Vatican. I guess we're just supposed to accept everything she says on faith! If she has sources that readers could look up, why doesn't she include them? She does include a bibliography, but it appears to be related sources of information, not the sources for the quotations she includes or the accusations she makes."
1,"Unimpressive, on several levels.","That pretty much sums it up. I've seen this stuff on the web, this appears to just be a rehash without anything new and notable. The line about packing the china (which another reviewer picked up on) was hilarious. This just strikes me as a ""quick-and-dirty"" effort, more attention being paid to getting it out and making money off it than to actual content and information. Again, very unimpressive, but hey...that's what reviews are all about, right? Like someone else said, SAVE YOUR MONEY."
5,Blew me away!,"I had to jump in here when I saw what some people were doing to this poor author. I can testify that these people certainly do not know what they are talking about! The book is just terrific! Well put together, nice length too. I am so glad it wasn't a heavy tome. I didn't know what to expect, but I really ended up liking it!When I heard that all the information in the book could be found on the internet, I was really worried. But, after reading it, I can tell you that there are a lot of new developments in there that you just can't find on the web. Great job, Ms. Keating! Keep em coming!"
1,Wouldn't Waste My Time!,"I almost bought this book until I heard Art Bell interview Ms. Keating on Coast To Coast AM. Fifteen minutes into the interview made me realize that this woman is a complete nutjob! If you like reading the opinions of religious wackos who think that we are all going to PAY for every impure thought that we have, go for it! She reminds me of those evil nuns of bygone days, who used to beat the little boys for looking at the girls and give the girls ugly haircuts so that they wouldn't tempt the boys! This woman is so sexually repressed and puritanical that she told Art Bell that the women who tempt him and cause him to have sexual thoughts will have to answer to God and pay for those sins!That is about as far as I got in the interview. I wouldn't read this woman's books if she autographed them and GAVE them to me!"
5,I'm Impressed With This Author!,"This is an excellent book with so much valuable information. I was so relieved to see that it wasn't one of these fat books full of trivial information. The author is an excellent writer and I have never known an author who was kind enough to apologize for the delay in publishing and mailing. I have waited much longer for other orders with no explanation nor concern about the delay. I'm very pleased with the book quality and especially the sincerity of the author. She shows character, which is unusual in this day and age, and a very strong devotion to Our Blessed Mother. I now feel well informed, especially about my Catholic faith and beliefs. This book should not disappoint anyone who has a sincere faith and an open mind to learning about the dangers which will eventually fall upon us. It is well worth reading and I recommend that more and more people read it and digest the material seriously."
1,Not Worth the read...,"I heard this author on Art Bell's show 'Coast to Coast'. In the book, only her way is correct on translations of the final days. Actually, the book is alot of gibbish, and more sci-fi/horror than anything. It could be considered a scare tactic to unnerve the populace.Believe me, this book isn't all that it's cracked up to be. It's really not that good. If you want to read about the New Millennium, read Edgar Cayce, or Nostradamus. They give a more open, more exact way of the new millennium"
1,Not worth the money.,"I've never written a bad review before, but this book deserves it. Poorly written, very sparse, and to echo another reviewer, shoddy.Don't bother with it.On the brigher side, there's a convenient list of suppliers in the back of the book. Give me a break.Read Art Bell. Read Malachi Martin. But not this."
1,This Book Is Pure Self-interested Fear Mongering,"This book is not a serious piece of work. Rather is a lie from copyright notice on. If the author was an honest person, she would have posted the first copyright date. No, she posts 2000 so as to give you the impression that this book entirely new. It was obviously written in the early 90's and has been doctored up here and there from time-to-time. But this only makes sense when you get to page 119. They have a for-profit catalog of product covering 18 pages. One real survival tool that is a must have in this for-profit money pitch is the book, How To Change Your Husband."
5,Can't Wait For The Next One!,"This book was just fantastic! I can't wait for the next one. Hopefully we'll be able to hear Kathleen on the radio again. She's just a wonderful person! I really enjoyed this book and I know the next one is going to be just as good. Her website is fantastic too, just tons of content. Keep up the good work, Kathleen!"
4,Good software package,"I am a lawyer, but hate preparing estate planning documents. I bought this software to see how it operated and find out if it worked very well so that I could recommend it to family and friends. This saves me the time of preparing the documents myself, and allows them to update them when they feel necessary. Good program if you are familiar with estate planning documents and their purposes."
4,One of few that is filled with mystery and humor,"In reading the previous reviews, I think this book has not been given it's due. I have read the book several times for the humor found within it. I have been a police officer for 26 years and found The Golden Orange to be full of police humor from the first chapter to the last. The lead character leads the life of a pentioned out officer who is constently battling his past using alcohol and levety to ease that past. Wambaugh molds every character into ones we can all relate to. The police characters are no doubt taken from Wambaugh's experience as police officer from the synical old timers to the optomistic green rookies. There are FEW books I would recommend as highly as this one for action, mystery and real belly laughs. I only wish he had 100 more like it."
4,Pulpy,"This is a really enjoyable read. What's unusual is that the author telegraphs the plot twist very early on, but you still enjoy the characters enough to keep you reading until you find out exactly how it plays out."
4,a good and entertaining read,"Whis book by Wambaugh was a wild and wonderful read. The lead characters were very well sketched out and very believable. Their dealings with each other was interesting and kept your attention. The conclusion was believable and an interesting surprise. It is an enjoyable and quick read and is well worth reading.J. Robert Ewbank, author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
2,A weak effort,"I agree this book would not have been published if Wambaugh didn't already have a good track record. The plot is a variation on ""Body Heat,"" but the outcome is telegraphed so early that the only fun was seeing how the details would vary. He also seemed to be emulating ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" in early chapters, but without success. Some of the dialog made me wince."
1,Poor,"If Joseph Wambaugh had no track record, this novel never would have been published. And I live in Orange County, so I was pre-disposed to like this book. But it is poorly written, and the plot doesn't even start until half-way through the book. I wanted to like this book. But I sure didn't"
2,Wambaugh dishes the dirt: Orange Curtain turns red,"What do you want in a Wambaugh book? Cheesy sex, tough cop talk, twisty plot, alcoholism... Plus Orange County gossip. Sound exciting? If you know Newport, or were there in the late 80's/ early 90's, there's some good in it. He captures that funky essence of the place. Remember the birdman, the mackeral runs, the smell of corndogs, the bikes, the piers...the Fun Zone?! So I'll give it a 2: Not quite a total waste of time."
1,Like Reading a Textbook,"The title sums it up. This was one boring book. Almost got me drummed out of my bookclub! While there are a few interesting facts this is not a book to be read for just the enjoyment of reading. Good for research, but remember it is the authors views not fact. I gave it one star only because I did find it interesting learning a little about the author. Otherwise, it would have received no stars."
1,Cultural String theory.,"I come from the same people as the author and see things quite diferently.The book impressed me as a very windy and preachy screed of self-adulation and pseudointellectual posturing.Filled with nonsequitors,gushing kudoes to his liberal friends and the Kennedys,and all based on this laboriously contrived theory thatIrish-Americans possess cultural and personality traits that have their origin with the Potato Famine.There are a few.The dont tread on me attitude is one but then most people who have been oppressed(and that is most people)have the same trait.I admit to a certain bias.While Mr. Hayden was sleeping with Jane Fonda and getting arrested in Chicago in the 60s becoming somewhat of a political celebrity,I was starting a medical career on the southside of that city while raising 5 very young children.Nice try Tom but Robert Emmet your not."
5,Good product for a good price,Looks good. It's compact - it folds up in a small plastic bag - which can fit in a purse. Easy to adjust.
2,The label that won't let go,"Functionally, the cane is fine. But one buys a floral cane for looks as well. When I took off the manufacturer's label, the paint came with it. I'll say this--the paint came off neatly and cleanly. There is now a neat white patch where the label used to be."
4,Great Travel Cane,"After a long drive in the car or after an airplane flight, I am often very happy I thought to bring along this folding cane. Too big for my purse but perfect for a traveling tote. I keep it handy in my car."
3,Light but needs something to keep it folded,"This is light and secure but with a few small problem. The handle does not hang off the arm well. If you need both hands, you will have to set the cane aside.The folding is easy but there is no way to keep it folded. If I fold it up to put in the back seat of the car, it will unfold itself.I'm looking to make a strap that will let me fold the cane and maybe a hook to hang it.It is good looking but the handle quickly developed a chip. I never dropped it or even used it much, so I cannot say much about the durability of the handle.On the good side it adjusts well and has no slippage."
5,It's a cane! It folds!,"It's a cane. It works for a cane. It's rather cute. I have intermittent knee problems, so it's nice to be able to tuck this away when I don't need it. When I do, just whip it out and limp away."
3,"Great Cane, but is i really blue?","I ordered this cane in the ""Blue Cyclone"" variety.As a cane it functions well, but as a 20-something recovering from an injury I didn't want to end up with a weird looking cane... And to me it looked more purple-haze than blue. Not wanting to carry around what could be a methaphor for a classic Jimmi Hendrix song, I decided to return this cane and when with the black foldable HUGO cane. That one is ACTUALLY black."
5,Fancy Cane,I had a great transaction with this seller. My merchandise arrived earlier than expected and in brand new condition. I would definitely do business with this seller again.
4,Bargain price and portable pretty cane,"This is my first cane. Who really wants to be cane shopping? Not me. I was happy to see there were lots of colors and patterns. I selected a folding cane because I only need it (now) for bad days. This cane seems quite sturdy when opened, is adjustable, and isn't depressing! I'm quite pleased with the quality."
5,Works well,I purchased this because I have some back and knee problems. It works well but if you require a cane for full support you may want to look for one that has a wider tip at the bottom. It is perfect for me in that I need it for moderate support. It fold easily and is very stylish.
2,Beware of Older Versions,"If you plan to use these to study for certification, beware of older versions that might not fully prepare you for the current version of the test. The workbooks/tests change annually."
2,Interesting but Disappointing,"An interesting compilation of many of Robert Johnson's most famous songs, with wide variation in the quality of performance. The album is worth having if you're interested in blues, especially if you like to understand the roots of the music and its development over time. As a series of performances, however, the album is fairly weak.The album features some well known blues singers such as Taj Mahal, and Honeyboy Edwards, now a very old man, who actually played with Robert Johnson. Edwards' interpretation of of a Johnson song may well reflect Johnson's actual style quiteaccurately.Overall, this is an album that will interest committed blues fans, but probably won't appeal much outside that group."
4,Get It,"You'll prefer Will Oldham if you don't actually like the blues...or want to meet them. If you do, this is one of the better releases of recent years, and it can also serve as an intro to some fine young players, including Chris Thomas King and Keith Brown."
4,An enjoyable view of ancient Egypt.,"The trials and social battles that the young girl, Thu, faces to rise from meager peasant to Pharoah's concubine entice and enthrall the reader from the beginning. Ms. Gedge's writing style, fluent and descriptive, is easy and comfortable to sit and read for hours and hours at a time. So, with the help of her new Master and leaving her family behind, Thu adventures through the various social arenas of Egypts aristocrats to rise and emerge a successful and cunning play-thing of the mighty Pharoah, only to be entwined in a plot so thick that the memories sting Thu still as she narrates this account of her youth. I really enjoyed the story and am now reading the second book of this series, ""House of Illusions""."
4,Not giving any exercises,don have any this to sy this book is the same as the manuali think if it has some exercis it would be much batter..
4,Nice little book,"If you are a begginer that's a good book, it goes deeper into the effects of different settings than the instructions that comes with the camera, and shows samples of pictures at different settings. If you know how to use and the effect of different values for complicated settings such as white balance and others, you don't need this book.I would also like to add that the book comes with a nice pocket guide to some settings of the 20D camera."
3,Good,"This is one weird compilation.Funk elements starts out with funk: ""Quit Jivin',"" by Pearly Queen. Just as you start settling into your platforms, the jam car starts swerving all over the place. There is Latin Jazz ""Latino Loco"" by Nelson Petion, Jimmy Smiths ""Tea For Two Mambo,:"" some Western Swing, some dancehall.You could plausibly argue all these form branches on the funk tree. Listening to this reminded me more of hearing a really good free form radio show than hearing an album: there are loose connections but not a solid sound that binds everything together. If you have this on while doing something else you stop to recall if you changed the CD and forgot.I like it, but if your looking for solid 1970s stomp, this is not the album to get.By the way, if you think you vaguely recall ""Quit Jivn'"" you probably are right. DJ Shadow sampled the horn break on ""Number Song,"" onEndtroducing....."
4,winter covers,"I will see how tit winters, but all is good so far. The material is a heavy but pliable fabric.. Good quality for the price"
5,Heavy Duty,This cover is great! Very heavy Duty and nice looking. It covered my stack of chairs completely and snugged down.
5,excellent quality and fit,I was skeptical of the quality even with all the great reviews. But the cover was much better than I expected.It has already seen a couple of snowfalls and heavy winds. Very good quality and details such as two clasps for wind resistance. I recommend it with confidence.
5,Stackable Chair Covers,"Awesome and well worth the money. I think the cover will hold up for a long time. The cover is thick and well constructed and will actually fit 7 or 8 stackable chairs, depending on the size of the chair. I was really impressed with the quality of this cover."
5,Veranda chair cover,This is the absolute highest quality cover you will find. The cover is well made with heavy weight material and well stitched. There are two quick release straps to fasten to the legs. Outstanding value.
4,covers,"The product is well made. I would have liked to have a little more flexibility with the fabric, especially around the edges. Time will tell if it holds up in the bad weather."
4,Great with one issue,I have some of their other products a grill cover being one. The material is very high quality and should last many years. My only beef is that the drawstring cannot be tightened. It is a thin elastic cord embedded in a hem. No matter how hard you pull it just gathers the material in the front while the material on the other 3 sides is still flapping in the wind. I just tied the bottom with a bungee...no big deal.
5,Fits my 6 chairs!,"was worried that it wouldnt fit my 6 foldable chairs but all I had to do, was reverse the Front Back to Back Front. Fits perfectly and protects my chairs from the sun and cold."
5,Great stackable chairs cover,"This is a very nice quality product that covers a stack of patio chairs. I have only four chairs with high backs and the cover was just a bit too long. It wasn't a problem because I tied it up a little higher on the chair legs. It does says that it will cover six chairs, and I am sure that it will. Heavy vinyl,supple, and well made. I have a grill cover by this manufacturer, and it is very nice and has held up well. I'm sure that the chairs cover will too. I definitely recommend it."
5,Veranda Chair Covers,A very high quality outdoor chair cover elegantly designed with durable materials for longevity and protection. Ease of use added to the allure of this product.
5,Awesome Product,This cover is relatively inexpensive for what you get. Quite durable with plenty of room for 6 chairs. Great for winter storage. What a pleasure it was to take the cover off and find the chairs clean and ready to use.
4,great for girls and boys as first novels,Both my kids liked these as much as the Magic Tree House series.
1,I only wish it was a comedy. Or was it?,"Where to start? Edits that go on for too long. Really bad makeup effects. Bad Dialog. Lousy sets, costumes and props. But I will give them a star for the idea of the plot and the lead killer's acting.This definitely stays true to indie, low budget Horror!"
2,Too expensive for its short life,"While I really enjoy this product, the pen is really too expensive for the short amount of time that the highlighter has ink. The ink will dry up severely quickly and refills can be hard to come across. The highlighter is also not very bright.If you are looking for a pen and barely using the highlighter, these pens will probably do just as good as any other. Plus the benefit of the highlighter will definitely allow you to save time. However, it is a little on the bulky size so writing becomes difficult.If you are looking for a highligher(as I assume most people are), you are probably better off sticking to your average sharpie than this."
5,Great Idea-Why didn't I think of this?,"I do a lot of study using both a pen and highlighter. This is the best thing since sliced bread. I bought a few and gave them to friends of mine who also study the Bible and they just love it too. Everybody asks, where did you get these."
2,i thought this would be a useful item...,"but unfortunately, the pen does not work no matter what i do, so now i just have a highlighter with a big hole in the middle. not very helpful."
4,Great item for scholars and academics,"I love this pen. I'm a graduate student so I have multiple articles to read every week. I usually sit there with pen and highlighter in hand to mark on the pages, but this can be annoying and cumbersome. Now that I have the Duo it is easier to study and to do homework in tight spaces like cars and while waiting. Plus I'm the envy of my friends - they all think it is a really cool pen. I only wish they came in more colors."
5,RIGHT!,"Yes! All of you are right! There really should be a new copy of the Transformer movie. And with the commercial success of Transformers: Beast Wars, it should only stand to reason that Transformers are still here to stay. Isn't that a good reason for these big wigs to make money off us? I don't think any of us would mind plopping down a few bucks for DVD's would we? So, you hear that, Hasbro? Easy money. You've got a horde of fans on your hands demanding action with money placed firmly in fist. Lets get to work on those videos and DVD's! (If I had kids, I would probably buy them Transformer cartoons and tell them how they were King in my day...)"
5,Motorola FR60 FRS radio,"This is a great basic unit to introduce your technophobe friends & family to the fun & convenience of the Family Radio Service. Here in suburban Los Angeles, I've had no problems finding a clear channel without using the 38 ""privacy codes"" (sub-audible tones inserted onto the outgoing signal to be recognized by the receiving radio set to the same ""code"" tone) Signals are crystal clear w/great sound quality through all 19 floors of my work hi-rise and hilltop range 'line-of-sight' is well in excess of the advertized 2 miles. Fortunately, the transmit button is ergonomically correct, on the left SIDE, unlike the incredibly awkward face-center ones on the SLKs. The heavy duty construction makes for a solid, substantial though still compact radio, much more impressive than the toy-like feel of most other FRS units. My only complaint about the FR60 is the overly loud beep that accompanies every button push (except transmit). Overall - GREAT RADIO !"
5,No need to buy any other model!,If you compare all the 2 way radio's out there you'll find that most are the same. The have the same range and the same number of channels. The only difference between this model and the 280 series is that this one doesn't have hand-free.... BIG DEAL! The FS60 is a little larger but sounds exactly the same as the better models. EXACTLY! NO DIFFERENCE. So if you don't need hands-free don't bother looking at any other model...this one's for you.
2,OK for the price,"This radio is an ok product for its cost, but no where near as good as the radios with a slightly higher price tag. I bought these radios for a summer trip to WDW and had little to no luck finding a free channel to communicate on. Spending a little more cash to get a radio with 40 channels would have been worth it in order to have good communication between our parties."
3,Not as pictured.,"The product shipped to me was a newer version of MetRx than pictured by the company. I knowingly spent more money ordering from this company to get the specific type of MetRx. Had I known, I would not have purchased this in bulk. Also, one of the packets in the box was sliced open a little and there was powder everywhere.The picture and the product shipped need to match!The company was responsive and very good about it (they refunded my shipping)."
4,I liked it,"I don't really agree with the other review. I did sell my lens but I did not have problems with the picture quality at all. You have to really be careful though how you set all of the settings to get pictures really far away to come in clear. This is a professional lens, and it does take some knowledge to use. As far as cheap, I do not for one minute think that this lens is cheap. It is built very well. As far as not being able to take pictures in the dark like the other review said, my God you are shooting so far away you would have to have football stadium lights for a flash if you wanted to light up the place in the dark. I really liked the lens pretty good. My only complaint is that it is heavy and you need a good tripod not some cheap piece of junk."
3,Great price. Ok lens,"I bought this lens too take pictures of primates in Kenya, and it works great in well lit outdoor conditions with a tripod. This lens is way to large for indoor use, and does not render photos well with out ample light. This is not an auto focus lens so get good at focusing it. Also you will have to set your DSLR to full manual to use it. My biggest problem is that all of the fstop numbers and focal lengths are at the bottom of the lens, but then again I'm looking through a viewfinder so it doesn't really matter.Not for beginners, but its a steal if you are willing to work with it.Also fast shipping was a plus."
4,Good lens for the price,"This lens is awesome, best for taking close up picture of wild life and you must use tripod during daylight."
3,Not bad for the price,You get what you pay for. For $70 I think it is very cheap. The bad thing is picture quality is not of professional quality and you can not take pictures at night or in low lit areas. But again for $70 it is reasonable.
3,Not as good as Little Fuzzy,"While I am a Piper fan, this book seemed to be somewhat cliche by the time I had read it and the other two. The first of the Fuzzy books was wonderful, and it was the first Piper that I read, but the other two were less interesting. I think that this is because of Piper's plan: to write one book per CENTURY of terro-human history, not three books about a span of maybe two years at the outside. Don't go out of your way for this book, but it is worth reading if you stumble across it."
2,Cocktail hour! Silver-based movie film! The 60s in Space!,"I first read the Fuzzies books in high school. I was glad to find another in the series. And it certainly reads like the real Piper. When you read Jules Verne, you're amazed that a writer a hundred years ago could predict things like weightlessness. When you read H. Beam Piper, you're amazed that a writer thirty-five years ago couldn't predict that anything at all would change. There are so many anachronisms. And then there are quasi-melting pot names like (get this) Hirohito Bjornsen. Hirohito Bjornsen?!"
2,"Very old , no longer supported","it was ok linux back in 2002. It has very limited list of drivers. It will not recognize any newer hardware. And it is no longer supported. Get new Fedora 14 instead. I see no point of buying it in 2011, unless you collect them..."
4,RedHat Linux 6.2 Std is limited. Special purpose needed,"I acquired RedHat Linux 6.2 Std for a special research project I was working on. I knew it's limitations (i.e. lack of drivers for present day hardware) before ordering. It was a great product for it's time. I run RedHat 6.2 in a VM and it performs as expected. However, I would not recommend this product for non-professionals or novices looking for the latest and greatest operating system and functionality. You must have a specific, well-defined objective for using this version of RedHat. Otherwise, you will be disappointed."
3,Typical of the Tech Volumes,"This whole series is spotty. Frankly, I recommend them only to those who have a pretty good understanding of the aircraft covered. These volumes, and this is typical of them, tend to focus on little known aspects of the aircraft. To get the most from them, they presupose some knowledge of the basic aircraft. Even at this, they are somewhat disappointing. They are spotty in coverage of the details and the photographic reproduction is abysmal."
4,Nice comfy top but a bit pricey!,"These tops are very comfortable and cute. The embroidery is very nice, but the top itself is a basic soft ribbed undershirt type of material making it a bit pricey when all is said and done. I am giving this as a gift, and it is not as high quality as I prefer gifts to be. If I ever considered one of these tops again it would have to cost less and I'd pick a black shirt instead of a white one."
4,A Good Rival for the JetBoil,"I have tried both the MSR and the JetBoil. Same price roughly same heating (MSR a little faster) and the same basic volume for the backpacker. The MSR requires you carry a good lighter as there is no auto igniter. When it comes to the operation at elevation, I think the MSR is a little more robust. Either way you cannot go wrong with either."
3,Good headboard for the price,"I ordered this because it was different from most of what I had seen when shopping around. Good price and decent quality. Black paint was flaking off of the metal in spots when I received it but not worth sending it back over that or the few minor scratches that were on the piece. Overall, nice addition for our guest room."
4,Two problems to an otherwise very nice headboard,"The good: Nice looking, attractive headboard. The bad: Lousy directions for assembly. Only minimal info on the sheet. The headboard holes did not match up to a standard twin frame so there was extra work involved in getting things to line up. The good, again: It looks great in the room and matches so nicely with the furniture."
2,functional,Few chips and scratches in wood. Did not want to return because I needed it immediately. Will cover flaws with stain.
4,Rainy Day,"Rainy day music is what it is about. Oh and by the way...Ian Webber is from England the band was formed in Atlanta. I have followed them since the early years when they played local night at Hard Rock Cafe nearly 10 years ago. They consistantly produce awsome albums. They are a treat to see live. Also check out Ian Webber 's solo project ""Blanket Covered Morning"". Their 1st album is the best."
2,Garage Beat,I did not think any of this collection was worth the listen. Disappointed as have heard some gems from that era but this copy did not have any for my taste.
3,Cute toy,We bought this toy for my son when he was 4 months old. He hasn't really shown much interest in it. He only likes to chew on it. Maybe when he turns 1 in a few months he'll show more interest in it.
1,Poo on Pooh,"Why waste your money on something boring and uneducational? My son was excited to recieve Pooh as a gift, but never touched it again. I donated it to charity a long time ago."
3,Cute Toy,"My baby likes this toy somewhat, she really liked Winnie the Pooh but she would probably mess with it more if it made some type of noise. It is good don't get me wrong for the basic stuffed animal."
5,Innovative and Passionate!! Rachel Z playing is hypnotic!!,"I have listened to the cd several times now, and have grown to like every song, especially Chris Cornell's 'Black hole sun' and Rachel Z's own 'interlude'. The albumn consists of Tony Levin, bass player of Peter Gabriel, who displays some magnificent riffs to back the sensuous, but heartfelt improv that Rachel embellish's over songs by soundgarden, smashing pumpkins, johnny cash, rolling stones and etc. If you like jazz piano and do not own this cd, you are missing out on some beautiful music!!"
2,"god, my soul just died....","every one I know plays better than her. A couple of left hand chord voicings that sound jazzy and suddenly you're a jazz artist.To call this jazz is an injustice. She's got a terribly small 'bag of tricks' to handle putting out an album. One clip had like three note on it.What's that about?Save your money people and get some Coltrane or Miles, like the site says: People who buy Rachel Z also buy Coltrane or Miles. What?"
3,Good story with a few flaws but still good,"I just finished this novel and liked it. I was unaware it was part of a trilogy until I came here to Amazon to look it up. That probably explains why a few elements of the story were not explained and I just had to imagine to myself what they were (transcience, transflexion, effectors). Also, some things were given simply a cursory definition (Reefer). Then there were some quirks in the writing, like frequent references to an adult woman character as a ""girl"" and always saying a character's first name and last name (Molly Zaldivar was never just Molly - why?). Even so, I read the book quickly and enjoyed it. While the main character was quickly annoying, I liked the rogue star and Cliff Hawk and I liked the ending.Maybe not a perfect story, but good and it goes on my preferred sci-fi book shelf at home."
5,Strawberries & Creme Candies,"Thank you for having this product available to be purchased on Amazon.com. PLEASE DO NOT DISCONTINUE THIS PRODUCT FROM this website. If so, please let me know immediately so that I can purchase these candies. Please do not give out my personal contact or credit card information to other companies, especially without my personal permission or authorization to do so.I am not sure about how to do this or whether I am even doing this correctly. Please explain this to me in a simple way for me to understand about this review process and how it works.Anna Mae Gardner"
4,These are delicious!,These candies have a delicious strawberry taste! I'd give them five stars if not for the sugar.
1,If I could give it zero I would,"Sorry, it's just not that good. I wish there were audio samples so you could understand. They are uneven and all over the place tempo-wise, their drummer has trouble keeping rhythm (a big problem if you are a drummer), and the songs sometimes seem so drawn out that you want to shoot yourself in the face. If you see this at a used CD store, buy it so you can make fun of it with your friends!"
5,Fingerprince is nice,This is one of the best records I own. The songs tie together so well it is hard to beleive that this was once actually two albums combined to one for cd release. Very unexpectedly this has become the most lisened album I own!
5,Get this player!!,"I just bought this unit recently and it plays beautifully!! The picture is sharp and clear and it is very easy to set up and use. I would recommend this player to anyone and everyone!!!! For the size, this IS the player to get!!"
5,Great deal,"I am always leary about buying off brands, but this charger works good and was a fraction of the price of the Canon charger."
3,They're OK.....,"I bought these bibs for my daycare and I have gotten a lot of use from them. They are better than the Circo bibs I was using and the velcro has held up. However, the three shown on the right of image are useless. They don't prevent moisture from going through the bib onto clothes! I use mainly the two on the left of image. They are now falling apart and the images are rubbing off on the children! Again I'm on a quest for affordable strong bibs."
2,o,"ok really didnt get in to it too much was free anyways from the online store, but good fine for people who like this"
4,What a Find!,Gospel-country-rock will soothe your souland heal your broken heart.This is a major talent.
4,Very useful book for computer sciences.,"This book have a good introduction of basic coding theory. Very interesting the Z/2 fields and the polynomial arithmetic. This book is used at University of Salamanca, 5th of Ingenieria Informatica."
3,"lots of facts, but a bit stodgy.","It's fascinating, and detailed as far as his rituals and philosophy. But the ""Confessions"" are much more fun. Also, he covers Crowley in Mexico very briefly, whereas AC has much to say about it in his book. Still, I liked it."
1,Bored me to tears,"Considering the colorful and strange life of a man who lived during the Victorian era - I see Crowley not just as a sexual deviant and drug addict, but also an icon of the sexual revolution-in his time even table legs had pants put on them, and chicken legs were never called that - but ""drum sticks"". Strange cage devices were strapped on boy's penises to prevent them from masturbating, and some women were made to wear a ""Chasity belt"" to ensure fidelity. That was the era Crowley lived in. Then he came - doing what he wilt :-) which means holle raising (in more ways than one), man and womanizing, and so on.At the same time Sigmund Freud penned his psychosexual development theory and shocked the world.Despite how interesting Alister Crowley was-the book was unusually wordy and BORING. I mean COME ON it was a terrible struggle getting through the first few chapters. DRY uninteresting reading with a complete lack of sources.****YAWN**** over and over again ***YAWN***"
1,Is Aleister Crowley boring? Is that possible?,"It's a shame that this book is so tedious, because the author knows his subject. I read Lawrence Sutin's biography of PK Dick and I was impressed, so I had high hopes for this one. But there's no structure to the story, no plot. Sutin moves from one moment of Crowley's life to the next, never making it clear if he's describing a high point, a low point, a turning point, etc. Halfway through, I promised myself I'd finish the book, sure that as Crowley's life reached the end, Sutin would bring things to a climax. But he didn't. Sutin knows the facts but didn't present them in a compelling way."
2,"Boring.....Really , Really Wordy & Dull.","I always sit thru the entire movie, listen to the entire album and finish every book I ever start. With one exception. I did what ""I wilt"" and returned this to the library after 50 pages. The book starts out very slowly and stays at a ""snail's pace"" page after page. Very little is revealed about the occult & magick aspects of Crowley's life. If you really need to know about Crowley's life this book is really the only one available, so I quess you could consider it a must read for that reason alone.."
1,what a despicable man,"I admit, my over arching dislike of this despicable man makes it almost impossible to do a balanced review of the book. The book does take us from the beginning of Crowley's life to his death and provides the sickening details of his ""magik"" progress. That alone would be sufficient enough to make one ill, but the author makes Crowley's perversions and mental illness sound like an everyday, ho-hum normal kind of thing. How a psychotic man like this ever got a following is beyond me. The author does do a good job of detailing Crowley's life and interactions with others, as well as his desire to elevate himself in his ""craft"". It seems to be a solid, true to life biography of a man who will make your stomach turn."
2,An unexpected result,"Somehow Sutin manages to make Crowley boring. This is a dull, patchy uninteresting book with a confused narrative. A more intelligible introduction is to be found in Martin Booth's 'A Magick Life' (at the time of writing UK only, but available from Amazon.co.uk), though Booth, too, tries a bit to hard to be kind to his frankly deplorable subject. Best of all, try John Symonds - not 'The Great Beast', but his lesser-known updated version 'King Of The Shadow Realm'; if you can find a copy, that's the book. Sutin has some good photos, though not enough of them, but his text is so turgid. Do what thou wilt, indeed, but I recommend that you avoid."
2,Disappointing,"This book is basically a chronicle of the places that he lived,the women and men he was with and his finacial problems;with only a most surface account of his magical practices or his philosophies. A dry,boring book that took some effort to finish."
5,Good Buy,"I bought this so I could save on the ""store bought"" waffles. I now know what goes into my waffles as well as preparing them to my satisfaction. I usually make up a week's worth of waffles, freeze them and use as needed."
3,Sandwich/Waffle maker,"I thought this was an okay item. I wish the pockets were just a little deeper and wider for sandwiches, but it makes really good waffles. I give the sandwich part of it a 3-1/2 and the waffles a 4. I do like that it clicks shut to secure the sandwiches and waffles and there is little, if any, spill over when making the waffles. It just depends how much batter you put into it. One other thing, it took quite a few uses to get the unpleasant smell to go away from it being new."
2,"Worked great at first, then broke after a few uses",The plus side to this product is that the plates remove. The downside is that it was defective and the plates didn't fit properly after a few uses. I had to manually put the sandwich plate on top for it to work and it still didn't cook evenly. The non-stick surface also lost its stick after a few uses. Next time I'll buy one that doesn't have removable plates.
4,works well but...,"Everytyhing worked well. The removable plates were easy to take in & out. The waffles were easy to pop out - the non-stick surface worked great. However, it really did take at least 4 minutes per batch of waffles. You would need to start early if you wanted to make enough waffles for a large family breakfast. That seems to be the main problem with this unit. I haven't used the sandwich plates yet so I can't comment on that."
5,Great!,"We are a family of two, so this waffle maker is the perfect size!It makes great waffle & cheese pocket pretty quickly, we use it so often."
4,good buy,i ade waffles from scrtach and they turned out pretty damn good...this is definately a good buy for the price.the sandwiched werent that crisp but may be if i would have kept them a little while longer they would have toasted well maybe.just one flaw i noticed was that the heating lights are a little diffuclt to spot...as they are both turned on during the cooking process so it can be sometimes confusing to undertand whether your sanwich is done or not
1,Cheap Quality Grill,One thing I find offensive is buying a name brand product and have the thing deteriorate. The coating on this grill was bubbled up and in some places cracked. Buy one if you only need it for the weekend.
3,Works fine but has issues,"This works great, and I love the versatality of the two plates. Also it easy to clean with the plates being removable. The only problem I had was when I was squeezing it shut the handle broke and cut my thumb pretty badly. I really didn't force it, the sandwich was just two pieces of bread and two thin slices of ham, or use much pressure. It just sort of popped and cut into my hand. the handle is a very hard plastic and broke like glass. I put tape on it for safety and we still use it, only very carefully now."
1,Bad latch design,"At first, I loved this product. It made great sandwiches and waffles. It was also easy to use ad clean. However, after only 7 uses, the latch that clamps the top to the bottom broke off. The latch is a terrible design made from cheap plastic. Beware!"
3,I must not be treating the plates right,"I love the removable plates, but after washing them (can never get them to stop coating my hands black) they started to stick even after a light coat of oil. Now I think I have over oil it because I have a film of sticky oily substance on them that won't wash off.The plates do not come together enough to cook the waffle from both sides."
4,It is well made sandwich maker,Good side:1. Hot sandwiches taste good2. Grill plates are easy to clean3. Makes eggs in perfect triangular shape4. It does not take long to make sandwiches5. does not need to use oil on grill platesbad side:1. When cheese gets on the machine it is hard to clean2. It does not have any timer (only green light and red light) therefore you have to guess when the sandwich is ready.
4,satisfaction,"I was looking for a product that would make sand, an waffel,s this has turned out to be the best. Easy to clean an understand the instructions, Very happy!"
4,Makes for a good dual purpose gift,"Bought this for my father who likes to make waffles, plus my mother makes cheese sandwiches on a rainy day accompanied by Campbell's tomato soup. It prevents you from having to buy two kitchen appliances."
2,Not to impressed,"I have used this product nowseveral times, only for waffles. It takes to long to warm up, takes way to long (15 minutes) to cook, and they still come out ""soggy"". I am not recommending this product at all."
5,From an RN,"This book is an informative guide to almost everything anyone would want to know about Parkinson's Disease. It has in depth information about diagnosis, meds, and a great amount of information on ways to manage this disease. The book was bought for a patient, but the nurses I work with all wanted a copy. In my opinion, the text is at a college reading level--it is not simplified, and readers not familiar with medical terms would want to keep a medical dictionary handy. It would make a very good resource for the patient with a high reading level and for members of the medical team who are looking for resources for patient education on Parkinson's Disease."
3,A good resource..but,The book is a millisecond behind the curve but is still a very good resource. It is difficult to read due to font style and size. I find Parkinson's Disease (A Johns Hopkins Press Health Book) to be more current and readable. Another plus is it is available for Kindle.
3,all looks,Very stylish however it doesn't hold much for long. I think it started to form a hole in the bottom after three months and I usually only carried a book or maybe a small change of clothes in it.
1,Great,For Christians searching for truth outside the Religious Box. This book is a light they need to use. It really explains what a prophet is in our modern day society and like the OT prophets. You will not be accepted nor understood by the people in their comfortable Religious Box. But to Seekers of Intimacy with their Heavenly Father this book is a real way to learn to look up instead of what the Religious Box leaders want you to do; which is look at them.
3,Lack of Focus,"This book starts off rather strong regarding the prophetic ministry, but only for a little bit. About half way through, the book veers off course, and by the end of the book, I believe it almost completely shipwrecks, with very little left to salvage. The end of the book seems to become more dedicated to some odd flavor of dispensationalism, and one almost forgets they are reading a book about prophetic ministry. I was expecting much more from Sparks."
3,What I think.,"I work in a grooming salon, and we use the Bio-Groom products. In my opinion, if I am washing a dog with an oily coat-like a yorkie-this is what I will grab for first. It does a great job cutting the grease. Although, I have got a very small amount in my eyes before (several times from dogs shaking in the tub) and it is not tear-free. It burns. The oatmeal shampoo from Bio-Groom does not hurt in the eyes though-at least human eyes."
1,The biggest peice of garbage in film history,"Don't waste your money on this half A$$ed attempt at film making.. watching paint dry on a monkeys rear would be much more entertaining.. Or even possibly stabbing yourself in the eye ball several times with a soldering gun.. I feel sorry for the cast and crew that worked on this debacle, i'm sure this is the film they ""don't talk about""."
1,"Really, really bad. Rent it if you must seet it.",The editing and direction are third rate. I've seen many student films that are much better than this. Avoid buying and rent it if you must see it. I'm sorry I spent the money based on the reviews which were probably left by some of those involved in the making of this home made video project.
3,OK at first,"I liked this a lot when it arrived, and it is doing the job of a doormat quite well, but, sadly, the lettering is fading already."
2,Beware of Cheap Materials,"I thought this was so cute and ordered two - one for the front door and one for the back. I have a big dog (Great Pyranees) so it was perfect. But, living in the midwest, we get snow and ice. My porches are covered so not too much snow got to them but the mats became brittle and started to fall apart. When it warmed up, I went to Menards and bought two black rubber sturdy mats and some flexible glue that is supposed to be stronger than super glue and glued the mats to the back to try to save them. On their own they only lasted 6 months but hopefully with the new backing they will last longer."
2,Very Academic,"This book did provide a good method of creating tables to help identify concurrency issues and as a possible method for analysis of concurrent systems. However, the presentation within this book is extremely dry and this newly learned method is truly overkill for most applications. If one wants to learn about the academic perspective on concurrent programming, then this book is absolutely for you, but if you want a book to give you the concepts and then some practical applications within Windows or Linux then you should definitely look elsewhere."
5,"Insightful, Challenging, Thought-Provoking, and Life Changing Book!","This is quite simply, an amazing book. It explores, most powerfully, how our perceptions of time affect our experience of time - and how we can learn to manage that. Stephen Rechtschaffen does a beautiful job of laying out the difference between clock time and what you might call soul time.His premise is that if we can shift the way we think about time and realize that every moment is filled with rhythms and possibilities that we usually don't even imagine, then we can become masters of our time, and our lives, in a whole new way!This is not about going faster or doing more -- it is about living more fully and more deeply. It is about getting to know ourselves again -- or maybe for the first time. It is about living NOW - which is everything.If you read only one book about time this year, this is the one that I would recommend. It is insightful, challenging, thought-provoking, and ultimately -- if you want -- life changing!"
3,Read Be Here Now instead,"Boy, I hate to do a bad review! I attended Dr. Rechtschaffen lecture of the same name last year. Fifteen minutes into the lecture...I got it already! Baba Ram Das said it better. Much better. But I picked up the book anyway. It was well written and would probably be very good for someone just beginning to feel dissatisfied with the mundane."
5,Easy and effective,I find this product to work very well with cats since they don't appreciate bathing all that much. Works great and easy to use
3,Doesn't spray right,"As far as the product it seems to work well. My complaint is the sprayer , it shoots a tiny stream instead of a mist like spray so it's hard ER to cover the surface equally."
1,scottish maid,"I was really disappointed with this book. It was lifeless and read like it was written by an elementary student. Not the teacher she is. With so many good writers out there, I'm surprised Joan Wolf is a published one...what were her publisher's thinking on this book!"
2,Beginner romance,"While Wolf has written other novels that I have enjoyed, this one felt like Introduction to Historical Romance 101. The characters were not in the least complicated, nor was the story line. The language and style felt as if it were intended for a very YOUNG female audience...Nell would be interesting to a sixteen to twenty-one year old reader, but not to one with more mature sensibilities. Even the vocabulary felt simplified. This does not make this a bad book, merely one that I could not recommend to anyone with any understanding of the period, or who wanted a more fully developed love story. It might be a good book to use to introduce your daughter or granddaughter to Historical Romance novels (but I'd prefer something there with more life to it and better characters). The sex scenes are tepid, the characters are one-dimensional, and there is a lot of internal prayer and moralising, if you like that sort of thing."
1,What happened?,"Wolf, used to be one of the best regency writers around. She's changed - suddenly her heros are beta males with no attractive qualities. Her heroines are wishy washy whiny babies. Her stories are watered down. Skip this one."
2,Bland.,"The Author appears to be trying to strike several balances in this historical romance, the first between history and romance. Because the characters she creates are rather shallow and lifeless, the emphasis veers toward the history...which she informs us at the end of the novel that she's *changed,* for the purposes of the book. That's one big problem. There is also an attempt to balance the physical passion of the couple with a strong attempt to make the heroine's Christian spirituality a major presence in the story. That doesn't quite work, either. If the reader isn't Christian, it's simply an annoying distraction, like a commercial for the same product that keeps interrupting the show.Religious agendas have no place in this product. There are far better historical romances out there for the price of this one. Hunt them down."
3,TO THE CASTLE is an OK Read...,"This novel isn't in the same league as her other novels, especially her Dark Ages Series and NO DARK PLACE & THE POISONED SERPENT. The story follows Nell de Bonvile and Roger de Roche and how and why they came to be together in the era of the War of the Roses between King Stephen and Maude. They were thrown together by chance when Roger's original betrothed, Sybilla de Bonvile, Nell's older sister dies. Her father continues the wedding plans with Nell as her replacement. Never mind that she has been convent raised from a young age.The story continues to follow their lives together in a rather mundane fashion. Parts of the book seemed unrealistic such as the husband waiting for the bride to be ready to consummate the marriage. It story moved rather slowly with no real surprises in the plot. Not one of Joan Wolf's best!"
4,relaxing read,Although not deep in any way it was a relaxing and enjoyable break from reality. Based on this book I will be buying more of her work.
4,The way back to where we are,"This is a very gentle book. It of course has to be gentle because of the subject matter; personal spiritual expierences. Attempting to write about these personal experiences is no mean feat. Words, in whatever language, cannot convey the personal experiences. The expierences take place where there are no words. This is a book to be felt rather than read. The expierences come from a place where we all are at, but due to the modern way of life we find it difficult to get back to that place. This book shows a way back to where we all are. A truly human book."
4,Thought provoking,A thought provoking sharing of experiences without pushing his own point of view; raising questions we all do well to think about.
3,A good read...,"This is a good book that is based on the recollections of Robert Wolff with a certain group of People. These People are what many would consider the opposite of North Americans. They do not have the same sense of time and they certainly do not believe in structuring their time. He passes on what knowledge he gained from these People to the reader. Personally, I found the book rather choppy and at times, rather dull. The point is that there is something within us all that has become lost because of ""civilization"". If you are looking for a quick read on the subject then this is your book. However, if you are looking for an entertaining and well thought out read on the same subject, I highly recommend Derrick Jensen's ""A language older than words""."
5,Adventure and Thoughts,Great book. Who says we have to travel to far away places for adventure? Tim Palmer had what for most of us would be a lifetime of adventures on this 9 month journey. At the same time the people he introduces us to and the observations he shares about all that he sees will make any reader think harder about our place on and responsibilities to this world.
5,Brilliant teaching book,"My heartfelt gratitude to this author and publisher--this book is so valuable a teaching tool,; it needs to be reprinted. It is so thorough and with so many clarifying vignettes. Enough color plates and plentiful black and whites. It's the knife work that most interests me, that can be seen in black and white perhaps better than color. I have never found a source so complete for knife painting. This author's writing style is so friendly and conversational, I feel as if he is speaking directly to me.Step by step, but nothing simplistic about it....very deep and valuable teaching. I am so grateful to own a copy it is a keeper...I expect it to be more in my hands thatn on my shelf, for frequent reference.If you can get a copy ...don't hesitate to."
3,"Short, sweet, and simple","If you want a ""quick"" read, this is the one. The characters are adorable and the plot simple, but touching. A sweet ending, makes you smile. However, the conversation appears stilted and so simple that it sometimes seems the characters are speaking to kindergarteners the whole time. A little bit too simple to be believed."
5,Teacher's Pet,This is a delightful movie -- and CLEAN! I was disappointed when I discovered it didn't fill my TV screen (guess you can get it both ways but I didn't notice that on the order blank.)I've watched it a few times since receiving it. Gotta love Doris Day and Clark Gable.
5,Great Movie With Two Great Stars,"Doris Day And Clark Gable Star In This Romantic Comedy With Gig Young Who Is Also Great In The Movie, A Very Funny, Fast Paced Ride Presented In Balck & White A Timeless Classic"
4,teacher's pet,"an enjoyable,riotous and fun to watch movie.clark gable gives a briliant performance as the over the hill editor with designs on the young and beautiful doris day,half his age."
3,Okay vehicle,"I kept trying to work out if there was any real chemistry between Gable and Day and I came to the conclusion that there wasn't really very much going on. He turns in a credible late career performance though there were one or two moments that suggested that he was just going through the motions and she, sporting an awful and completely UNsexy hairdo, is brisk and workmanlike. I don't know if that's largely due to the character she's playing or not..in any case there's not a lot of warmth there. The supporting cast are pleasant enough and it was nice hanging out with Mamie Van Doren, briefly. Gig Young's hangover act becomes aggravating pretty quickly. An amiable but slightly strained romcom."
5,One of my favorite movies,"This is a really a great comedy/romance and good plot, witty. Good support cast/characters and a charming story oftwo people who fall in love and the bumps and roads along the way. Well written and surprised that Hollywood hasn'ttried to re-make it but then again glad they haven't. Also enjoyed seeing how newspaper publishing used to be."
1,This movie should stay after class and clean the erasers.,"There's nothing like a good Mamie Van Doren movie, and this is nothing like a good Mamie Van Doren movie. Now I love Mamie, I'm passionate about Doris, and no girl with a pulse can keep her eyes off of Clark Gable and his potato ears, but I'd think twice before watching this boring thing. Not even Mamie'sRichter-scale sex appeal can liven up this dud. I'd suggest the vastly superior ""Pillow Talk,"" ""High School Confidential,"" ""His Girl Friday,"" or even the sub-par but tasty ""Thrill of it All."" Skip this one."
2,Morose Blathering,"I purchased this book based on the review of Bret Easton Ellis which highly rates Cooper as ""a brilliant, triumphantly lurid writer as well as a supremely elegant stylist, who prose is smart and nervy."" However, Cooper's melange of stream of consciousness and choppy philosophical masturbation does not equal great post-modern literature. The despondent philosophical ranting and speed-induced observations were annoyingly trite and tiresome after the first thirty pages. While I can appreciate this very self-deprecating genre, I would only recommend this book if you are looking to spend meaningless time reading meaningless flotsam."
2,"Fizzle, fizzle","Dennis Cooper has named his latest book after a punctuation mark -- the most common, perfunctory punctuation mark (except for the lowly comma). In case you're wondering why Cooper does this, I should probably inform you that _Period_ is meant to give closure to his previous novels, much as a period provides closure to a sentence. Actually, in this case it's more like a stake through the heart.The big news here is that George Miles reappears from Cooper's first novel _Closer_, and is marginally more interesting this time around.For such a tiny book, _Period_ is crammed to the gills with impenetrable incident. There are pseudo-satanic murders, body doubles, radio call-in shows and cyberchats, isolated teenagers shouting to the dark, rumors and rumors of rumors about a minor novelist, and a generous dollop of smoke-and-mirrors postmodernism just in case you think you might have understood what just happened.Not that there's any reason to care."
5,lifestyle choices?,"this one's even foggier, you just don't know what's going on, hardly any of the ultra detailed descriptions of, say, Guide, instead you're left with voices, diary entries and 'anonymous' internet chat, while the 'plot' just vanishes inside this multi mirrored projection hall. we're not really in the city anymore either, it's a small town, then a forest, then a house in a forest, and then someone gets lost in this house. Blair Witch? this is even scarier, I suppose, as we're left with traces, memories, voices and the usual all consuming dance of death and desire. Where next? we can't leave that house anymore, so we have to go back to 'Closer' and one of its characters, and we have to start a website with some strange photos of some distant looking boy, who we're slowly getting obsessed with...did i understand? are these still lifestyle choices? actually these are probably 5 stars, for at least 5 books. goodnight."
5,horrified? heartbroken? confused?,"'Period' by Dennis Cooper is at times horrifying, heartbreaking, or just confusing. Horrifying becauses of it's violent implications and stronghold to truth. Heartbreaking because of the overwhelming feeling of desire and missed chances. His dialogue and syntax keep reading interesting, if not hard to comprehend. He jumps around a lot, but that just adds to the whole darkness of the book. Without having read the other novels in this ""cycle"" , it takes awhile to figure out what's going on. 'Period' is a book that the reader will either read cover to cover three times, or set on fire after reading the first few paragraphs."
2,Do yourself a favor -,"Although this translation is concise and contained in one volume, the Penguin Books publication of this work (in that version, titled first as ""Story of the Stone"") is an infinitely better translation - the poetry is kept intact and the story is in full, instead of condensed for speed. In addition, the maids - who frequently outnumber the mistresses and masters in the plot line - are introduced to the reader with names in English, which makes the story a little easier to follow.If you really like this story and have not read the unabridged version, please do yourself a favor and find the Penguin publications. I love this novel, but there are better translations."
5,A great read,"The best novel ever written, in my opinion. The story is extremely complex. There are many subtle points that are easy to miss, but it is fun to read between the lines."
5,"'It's So Fine""","It ""so fine... I loved this book.Ms. Gonta weaves a poignant and fun tale of first love in an age of innocence. The blend of 1960's Philadelphia and catholic high school is a perfect background for this great story. It truly captures what so many of us were experiencing at the same time. I look forward to the sequel to read what happens to Mia,Ted,Sloopy and all the others."
4,Great Book,"This book is great an explaining principle, providing examples, and sample code. It would be improved my more visual explanation of method procedures."
4,a gift for a die hard fan,"he wears it to work, and he gets alot of attention so i guess it was worth buying . grear price !!!"
1,Do not buy this software,"If you are a beginning typist (or a proficient hunt and pecker) this software is absolutely terrible. There is no direct access to the lessons and practices so you can only go at a predetermined pace that is somehow built into the software. And if due to some glitch in the software, the program loses the level to which you have achieved, then it starts you all over again at the very beginning and there is nothing you can do about this."
2,Read this before Buying,"If you are a beginner, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I recommend, TypingMaster.Using this software, You can only go at a default pace set in the software. You cannot change the lesson time or repeat lesson rate. Forget about practice an extra set of keys.The one nice thing for advanced users : You can make your own lessons (even a simple *.txt will work). But as a beginner, I don't have the time to do it."
2,XP System users Caution,Each user of this program must have administrator rights on an XP computer for the program to run. I returned the program rather than give my 9 and 11 year olds administrator rights. Otherwise a wonderful program.
2,not for beginners,"This product looks terrific, with a lot of games, interesting features,etc.,but very soon you will be dissappointed as the program returns you to the same place again and again. You can do nothing about this. The seller's help is also useless.After 2-3 weeks of training I had to quit the program."
5,A real masterpiece,"One of the best novels I have read in a long time. The author describes in a very powerful and yet very touching way the difficult years of his childhood, when at a very tender age he lost his two brothers, 21 and 16 years old, his mother when he was 12, and his father when he was 16. The second part of the book concentrates on a man who lived during the Ottoman Empire in Cyprus and who is believed to be a distant ancestor of the author's.The novel is in essence autobiographical, but at the same time Costas Montis documents legends and customs of the island of Cyprus.Once you start reading this book, you won't be able to put it down. I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in a novel by one of the greatest Greek authors of the 20th century."
4,A book for any soccer fan. Well writen and understandable.,"I thought that John portrayed life in Kearny very well, and did an excellent job of stirring up the emotions involved with playing the beautiful game. The glorious ups and downs that he had through out his wonderful career were wonderfully and with full detail laid out for the reader to lap up. The last page-turner I've read in a while. An All around good book. Go Revolution!!!!!"
5,"""Ooh, aah, Johnny Harkes say ooh, aah, Johnny Harkes""","A must read for fans and non-fans of both John and the game of soccer. I'm a fan of both so that may be a biased opinion but I can't imagine that anyone would not enjoy this book. This is a story of a successful athlete from America in a not so traditional sport for our country playing at all levels here and abroad. I had no idea of what John went through during his career and it was very interesting finding out. Years from now while Major League Soccer continues to be a success and the game of soccer becomes more popular in the States, the author of this book will definitely go down in the history books as a player who helped make it happen. Thanks John for sharing your story and thanks for playing a great game!"
5,book review,"This is a wonderful book, and my grandchildren love listening to it and seeing the illustrations. Everyone sings along at the end of the story. I find that the children love to tell me about their favorite things when we are done reading, and that is what makes a book special. Making memories is what it is all about!"
3,Just Your Average Jazz-Rock Fusion,"I wouldn't say this one is as bad as some of the reviewers have stated here, but it sure isn't all that good, either. The playing is superb and it's hard not to be impressed by the sheer chops of all the players here, especially Tony MacAlpine. But I get the sense that MacAlpine is more of a rock player than a jazzbo and it becomes apparent that something is lacking there in this kind of a format. The compositions are really average or even below average here and there with nothing really to keep the interest going. It's not a bad album by any means because the musicianship is obviously superb, but in terms of melodic content, originality, creativity, feel and these other less tangible areas, I find nothing to keep me stimulated for a whole listening."
3,"Fun album, but nothing too special","Its always fun to listen to Macalpine tear it up. His technique is just sick. Other than his solos, i dont really find much else worth listening to on this album. For better Macalpine, check out Live from Oz by Planet X."
2,Typical Uninspired Fusion Fare,"This one should be viewed as an improvement over the first CAB album, but not by much. I was hoping for a marked improvement but it seems this genre in itself just doesn't have room to grow. The musicianship is typically superb but dry and clinical. There are no real melodies to really speak of, just your typical disjointed fusiony lines that showcase musical ""discipline"". An album like this should be of interest only to musicians playing the same kind of stuff. For listening, I think it's so boring that it will be useful for fighting those occassional nights of imsomnia."
3,Track 2 is great...the rest we don't use,"There are 3 tracks...the first one and the third one are a lot of talking. Only track 2 is music which IS really soothing. But having it sandwiched between talking makes it difficult to just press ""play"" and walk out of the room because the talking on the last track wakes up our son. Luckily, our son's CD player has a program feature so we just program it to play track 2 twice."
1,112th St.,I lived in Richmond Hill from 1947 to 1966. Going through the book was like stepping back in time. Having attended Holy Child Jesus Church and School I was thrilled to find my picture in the class photo. What a great time I had going back.
3,80s pop brilliance,"EG Daily's first album sounds just like an 80s movie soundtrack. Alot of great pop, and a softer Bonnie Tyler style vocal.It's incredibly rare to find on CD, so if you find it hold on to it as it sells for a fortune on Amazon and Ebay.The best tracks are by far the 4 Harold Faltermeyer tracks, espcially the classis ""Love In The Shadows"", and the Jellybean produced Stephen Bray written ""Say It Say It"".The other tracks are sadly not as strong, but overall still a great pop album.It's a shame the Giorgio Moroder songs from ""Scarface"", 1985 single ""One Way Love"" were not included on the album.It's an album that begs for a re-release with these tracks and also the great Stock Aitken Waterman produced ""Mind Over Matter"" from 1987."
4,Laughed until 3:00 a.m.,"I had so much fun reading this book and I could relate so well to the story that I couldn't put it down. I didn't cry, but I laughed alot. It was entertaining to read the author's impressions of my home state of Oregon. I was only disappointed that they stopped in Eugene briefly to make a phone call and fill up on gas. I guess they had to go see about a girl... Kudos!"
5,Excellent Reading!,"Donald Miller is an excellent author with great ideas. This book is not a masterpiece by any means, that is what makes it so great! It's easy reading, and it deals with so many of the issues that are facing Christianity today.Beyond being solid Christian reading, this book is incredibly entertaining. I love golf, and after reading this book, I can't wait to play it Donald Miller style! (Read it, and you'll find out!)I highly recommend it to all people in all walks of life, in every step of faith, it's worth your time, and your money!"
4,Creative and engaging scholarship,"Israel Knohl offers engaging scholarship that is accessible to a wide audience and offers some challenging and plausible theories regarding Jewish Messianic beliefs. For the price this volume is very slim, but I recommend this for anyone interested in exploring Jewish messianic beleifs in the period just preceding and contemporary with early Christianity. I find this work quite interesting; it helps Christian readers to better appreciate the Jewish context of early Christian belief."
3,Forgettable.,"Released in 1982, his days with Inca are over and with it his old-school sound. This album has more of a progressive sound to it. Frankie Ruiz does lead singing and starts the album off with one of his most famous songs, ""Lo Dudo."" ""Pancuco"" is pretty good and ""Te Estoy Estudiando"" also. However, (heres the downside) ""Patsy"" is a horrible attempt at an English merengue-ish song. The worst thing I've ever heard Frankie sing. ""Aha-Uhum"" is a merengue that's not half bad, still not my taste and what you're used to from Olivencia. If it were.nt for ""Lo Dudo"" this would be a completely forgettable album. ""It's okay"", but not by much. Tommy has done better."
4,a little confusing,"took me awhile to figure out how to load staples. instructions were not very clear. once loaded ,worked fine."
1,Received in bad shape,"This arrived in bad shape, looked as if it had just been used, had dirt in it, very disappointing, sent back."
5,Great Read,"I absolutely loved this book. I couldn't put it down. I haven't been able to say that since the Shopaholic series! This book had great insight to trials of the modern family. I laughed, I cried, I was inspired. I highly recommend this book. As I see other reviewers think her other books is better, I will be reading it as soon as I get my hands on it."
5,absolutely fabulous,wonderful novel. Easy read. I couldnt put it down. fabulous ending gave me goosebumps! A must-read!
1,Made for TV Movie to be.....,Don't waste your time. Even for a quick easy read this book was painful to finish.
2,Left me disappointed...,"After reading ""Good In Bed,"" I could NOT wait to get my hands on another book by Jennifer Weiner. Although I feel this novel was incomparable to her first (Good In Bed). At many points the book left me uninterested and the story plot itself becaming dragging. I stopped reading the book after I only had 112 pages left. I was extremely disappointed. Maybe if I read this book first and then Good In Bed, I may have had different views because I would not have had anything to compare it to. All in all I felt this book did not live up to my high expectations that I had for it."
5,Jen Weiner Does it again,"After grabbing ""Good in Bed"" and not being able to let it go, I was floored by ""In Her Shoes."" Weiner manages to subtly integrate seriousness and humor onto every page, creating charaters who are honest enough to criticize themselves, vain enough to excuse themselves, and hurt enough to beat the dead horses of their pasts into the ground. It is an insightfully real look at the relationships between related women.Any woman who has ever fought with her sister should read this book, then send her sister a copy."
3,Just OK.,I did a lot of rewinds as I found my mind had drifted off to other things while listing to this audio book. I got through the whole thing but thought it was nothing fantastic and a little slow.
4,Good book!,"this is another one of my favorite books. I own in the paperback version, and recently put it on my Kindle. I have read it several times, and is a nice, light, enjoyable book. The movie is also good!"
5,"Loved it, and the movie!!!!","Jennifer is an amazing writer. This book was not only well written, it was also heartwarming, touching, and sad. This book is a book that every mother should read before passing it on to their daughters. The movie is also very good except it leaves out some very important parts like the part when Maggie goes to Princeton. I recommend reading before watching In Her Shoes. This book is a perfect mothers day present for your mother, grandmother, and daughter. Thanks for reading my review. Also, don't forget to check out Jennifer's website and also her other books!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,A Great Read,"Despite the ""chick lit"" label, I think that Jennifer Weiner is an excellent author, not to be disregarded as pure fluff. All of her books that I have read have been page turners with great, character-driven plots, and ""In Her Shoes"" is no exception. The characters are often humorous, even extreme, but always believable. The sisters, Rose and Maggie, are completely different people, but both likeable. Even if you find yourself more like one sister than the other, you will sympathize with both of them and all their struggles."
4,Come on now....,"You have to take this book for what it is. Weiner isn't trying to write the world's greatest novel here. I too loved Good In Bed, and was struck by the similarities between the books. However truth be told the author managed again to create an enjoyable read, with likeable characters."
5,What an AWESOME read!,"What an amazing book this is! Jennifer Weiner is a fantastic author and she has definitely done it again. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a close sister, cousin, or best friend. Thank goodness for books like this one!"
2,A chore to get through,"I forced myself to get through this bore of a read because I kept thinking SOMETHING would happen to tie it all together! Unfortunately after trudging through this boring, go nowhere book I was left absolutely unfulfilled and disappointed that I had wasted time and energy on this. I usually like to save books or give them to friends, this was so bad I purposely left it in an airport, I couldn't stand looking at it! I apologize to anyone who found it and read it!"
2,it's been done before,"I loved Good in Bed but this was too close in story line and not nearly as clever. I had a hard time finishing this book because I kept feeling I had read it before. In her fist book, the main character had a life changing experience and then walked her way (literaly) to a thinner, healthier women with a child and a husband who was right there under her nose from almost the beginning. This story has 2 sisters (of course they hate each other...mostly due to envy) Both have life changing experiences and find a way to change. One of them even walks her way to a thiner, healthier women with a man who was right under her nose the whole time. Sound Familiar? I thought so. I don't know that I will ever read another one of her books for fear that I will already know the story...beginning, middle and end."
5,this is a great book!,I loved this book! I did not want to put it down. It is very similar to the movie but there is a lot more to it then what was in the movie. I think it's actually better then the movie although I enjoyed both the book and the movie. I highly recommend this! Next I'm going to read the sisterhood of the traveling pants by Ann Brashares.
5,Great characterization,"I don't think there's a person alive who couldn't relate to the tumultuous feelings between the two sisters as they struggle to find their own places in the world. Weiner's writing style makes it easy to slip into the characters' lives, to begin holding your breath as they encounter good or bad things in their lives. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I hope it stays true to the book."
1,Disapointing,"How can the author of Good in Bed produce such drivel? I am sorely disapointed with the sophmore release! Nothing grabbed me here, the characters are one dimensional, the plot nearly non- existant, and just generally boring. I did not feel any sympathy for any of these characters nor did I care what happened to them.If you want to read a good Weiner book, read Good in Bed again!"
4,Good writing. Sympathetic characters. Not your typical chick-lit read.,"Some chick-lit books are empty on plot - and even characters. That doesn't happen with this one. The two main characters (sisters) are very different from one another. One's smart, heavy, and unlucky in love, and the other is the complete opposite. Just as you start hating Maggie, the one who has it easy getting jobs and men, Weiner emphasizes a hidden dimension of her character that allows us to empathize with her and realize, that maybe, she doesn't have it so easy after all. This is not just a good chick-lit novel, it's a good book...period."
2,"Try ""Little Earthquakes"" instead","If you like Jennifer Weiner, bypass this one and turn to ""Little Earthquakes"" instead. ""In Her Shoes"" opens with Maggie, one of the two ""heroines,"" having drunk sex in a bathroom with a stranger. How is a reader supposed to root for her throughout the book when she's utterly unlikeable from page one? And Rose is more than a bit of a dud.The book covers a long time span; but it leaves out a lot of important day-to-day details that would provide valuable clues to the characters' motivations. I'd give plenty of specific details, but won't at the risk of revealing plot points. I just get the sense that even the author didn't care about these characters."
1,"Formulaic, at best","""Good in Bed"" was decent escapism, but this book is formulaic, at best. Maybe I am looking for too much in a beach book, but neither sister is this dramedy is likable, the run-in with the main character from ""Good in Bed"" is completely self-indulgent, and the story lines are predictable and tedious. You can find my copy of the book in the nightstand at the Maui Marriott next to the Gideon Bible and the Book of Mormon if you are looking for something to put you right to sleep."
3,Mediocre...,"I have mixed emotions about this book. I read it quickly, and enjoyed the story enough to want to know what was going to happen to the two sisters. Yet, there seemed to be little characterization going on. I wasn't satisfied with anything that happened in the end. A lot of the juicy story seemed to be left out in favor for a quick and easy reconciliation. And it is the type of book that I will forget quickly, unlike Good In Bed by the same author."
3,Forgettable...,"2 1/2 stars.This was an OK story for when you just want to read something real light and required no thought. Read it while you're on a week, or maybe 2-week, beach trip since it is also unnecessarily long.SPOILERS -This story was very predictable - I knew that Maggie would sleep with Jim, that Rose would end up with Simon, and that the grandmother would reconnect with everyone. I can usually overlook predictability for good writing but I did not connect with any of the characters and I did not understand some of their actions. Why was Maggie so rude to Ella initially? Why did Ella put up with it? And why did Maggie suddenly just open up after months of quietness to Ella? The relationship between Rose and Simon started suddenly and so fast that I question whether Rose really loved Simon.I still can't understand why this book was made into a movie!"
5,Rave reviews,"Haven't read yet, but got all rave reviews from friends. Fun to read, yet quite thought provoking and ""deep."""
3,One of those rare cases...,"...in which the movie is MUCH better than the book. The book is well-written and interesting, but not nearly as tightly written as the movie. The movie script definitely improved on the plot. I will read more of Jennifer Weiner's books. I'm sure I will enjoy them. If you haven't seen the movie yet, read the book first, then see the movie. You will enjoy the book more, and reading the book first will, in no way, detract from the movie."
3,Sappy Tear-jerker That's Worth Everything You Want from It,"I've watched my fair share of click flicks, but reading books from this subset of chick lit genre was a first (i.e. In Her Shoes reads nothing like Girl, Interrupted). Part One is slow, discordant, and full of disorienting switchbacks. By Part Two I couldn't put the book down. Part Three was everything you expect from the ""chick lit"" label: sappy tear-jerkers that culminate in a fairy-tale ending."
2,A literary snooze fest.,"One word: boring! When I pick up a chick lit book, I can usually expect to read it in a few days, one week max... Sadly this was not the case here, as I had it in my possession for about 2 months and just could not muster up the strength to pick it up time and time again (although I was able to get through several other books in between). Long story short, Maggie messes up, tries to make it up, gets frustrated, messes up again, attempts something else, messes up again, you get the picture. Grandma Ella reminisces a lot, and does a good bit of staring. To Weiner's credit I say Rose is a humble, likable character. As is expected, all ends happily ever after."
3,Good read but 'Good in Bed' still better,"I think this one rare situation where the movie was better than the book - the book still captures the style that I like about Jennifer Weiner but it isn't as absorbing as 'Good in Bed' and i think the movie really took its strengths and reduced the weaknesses while still delivering the same message (good job!). That said, if you like this author then this is still a good read, but tend to agree with other reviewers that Maggie is more of a horrible person that could be tolerated plus there were parts of story that could have been missed ie meeting up with the characters from 'Good in Bed' as that didn't go anywhere.So 3 stars as my litmus test is do i want to reread it straight away, do i keep thinking about it afterwards? (even for chick lit) at this point i would say it'll be a while before i feel like reading it again, compared to 'Good in Bed' and others."
3,Sweet,"I thought this was a fun, sweet book. Not having read Good in Bed, I have nothing to compare it too, but this book was interesting enough to get me to want to read other books by Ms. Weiner. Sure her characters were a little stereotypical, but that makes it much easier to find something in each one to identify with. Even after all Maggie does to alienate her sister, I still found myself wanting her to succeed and better her life. And as I was able to highly identify with the stuffy, uptight naive-about-men Rose, I kept wanting to shake her and make her wake up! When she finally did, I was happy to see her do well. Overall, an easy read that doesn't ask too much of you as a reader."
1,Pretty lame,"Sorry, I just could not like any of the characters, but especially not Maggie. I invite anyone who has read the book to answer the question, ""what motivated Maggie?"" Nothing she did made any sense whatsoever in light of the information we were given about her (sadly, that holds true for most of the characters in the book.) I don't think her biggest problem was a learning disability, but rather one heck of a personality disorder. If you want a bad girl you can learn to like, read Ain't She Sweet by Susan Elizabeth Phillips."
2,Lost me at hello,"I did like Good In Bed not only because it was finally a good book about a fat woman in love, but for Weiner's writing. It was flawless and as natural as a river flow, with carefully selected words. But In Her Shoes ""lost me at hello"". It looks like it's written by another person: cookie-cutter characters (smart fat girl, dumb pretty girl, nasty stepmother, etc.), clumsy sentences and a story so far stretched that it is tearing apart. Also for another book trying to make a point that ""appearances are not important"" there is too much paper and ink spent on actual descriptions of the looks, shoes and dresses. I give 2 stars only for the portrayal of Golden Acres senior community - it was the only part of the book that was close to real life and actually funny.Good In Bed felt like it was written from a heart (and this is why it stood up), but this one was made only for the money. I think I'll pass on Weiner's next creation."
5,Another enjoyable Jennifer Weiner book,"I am admittedly a fan of most of Jennifer Weiner's books. This one is no exception - I found it as enjoyable as ""Good in Bed"" and ""Little Earthquakes"". The characters are well developed, and have a goodly amount of depth to them - even Maggie, who personality-wise is shallow and selfish.It's very easy to warm up to and enjoy Rose early on in the book, despite her her lack of self-confidence. Maggie takes a lot longer to warm up to - you really have to get to know her more in depth and watch her transform to be able to like her better, as she starts out fairly badly. However, the book does a good job giving you background on both sisters and their personalities. And it's fun to watch both sisters develop into ""better"" people and ultimately develop a better relationship.Yes, you will occasionally want to yell at one (or both) of the sisters. But you will also laugh, cry, and cheer for them as well. This is a great read, and one I would highly recommend."
4,Great Follow-Up,"I read Good In Bed and was instantly hooked. When I got my hands on this, I admit I was expecting the same kind of basic rhythm. It is different, but still great. The relationship between the sisters is detailed greatly and needed to help explain where they are in their lives. You find yourself pulled into their lives and rooting for one and despising the other. While it is not as funny as Good In Bed, it shows that Jennifer Weiner can move into other areas of fiction. I do admit that the moment where Rose meets Cannie seemed a little forced, but it was nice to see her attempt to cross-reference the characters. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loved her first book. It is not the same, but still quite good. I realize some people were disappointed by this follow-up, but anytime the author gets you pulled into a book, the have earned their paycheck and this book does just that."
4,Love it alot!,"I have to admit that I let ""In Her Shoes"" sit on my bookshelf for a while, before I got around to reading it. After just finishing it up, I so sorry that I let this happen! ""In Her Shoes"" is a great book that tells the story about the relationship between sister that are totally different. Readers of Ms. Weiner first book will be happy to know that we get to see what Cannie has been up too. This is a really great book that should not be missed."
1,"Good in Bed was GREAT, I fell out of In Her Shoes!",I loved Weiner's Good In Bed. I was excited to read her next book In Her Shoes. What a disappointment! It has taken me forever to read and I haven't even finished the book. I began reading it in September 2003 and have not picked it up since. I have about thirty pages remaining but I just do not have the motivation to complete the book. It is very unrealistic. The writing is good but the characters are not appealing and interesting. I just was really disappointed with the book and am sorry that I wasted my time reading most of it.
2,In her shoes,"The first 2/3 of the book is really good and believable. The writing still is not impressive, but I read 2/3 of the book in something like 2 days, and I was very amused and entertained. But the ending of the book was way too cheesy for my, and I really had a hard time believing in the book (it's like the 3rd Lord of the Rings movie... the last half an hour should also have been cut out). The book became so bad in the end that it toke me 2 weeks to read the last 1/3 of the book. And I did not enjoy reading the end at all... A shame the ending was so bad, because the book really had potential! 4 starts for the first 2/3 of the book and 0 starts for the ending."
3,JUST LIKE THE MOVIE!,Just in case you didn't figure this out (like I didn't until I started reading it) this book is just like the movie with Cameron Diaz. Oh well - the movie is cute. Hate that I wasted a few dollars on this!
4,Pleasant read,"I really liked this, I haven't not seen the movie.Not my favorite book ever, but what a wonderful read! Author has a way . . . And I did cry at the end!"
3,awesome,"Jennifer Weiner's books get you hooked from the first page becasue of her unique style of writing. I enjoyed reading both, Good in Bed and In her Shoes, books but comparing them I liked Good in Bed. I felt like In Her Shoes was a very predictable book about two sisters who don't get along but at the end they realize they are more alike then different. In Her Shoes didn't pull as much attention to me then her other book. Reading these two books have encouraged me to read her third book. I am really anxious to know how Little Earthquakes ends."
4,Modern Fable of Sisters,"I'd give this four and a half stars if I could. I liked this book better than Good In Bed, and I especially liked the character of slutty beautiful Maggie Feller, who loves her dumpy, smart sister, Rose, but takes advantage of her.I didn't expect Maggie to like Maggie after her terrible, selfish behavior but she really grew on me. I loved the way she matured and how this maturity was not tied to a relationship with a man but by connecting with her family. Rose's transformation is a little too pat which is why I call this a fable.I loved the touching, funny scenes at the Grandmother's retirement community. A really entertaining and touching story."
4,Charming...,"Not normally the type of book I'd pick up. But somehow, I was tempted, and allowed myself a little guilty pleasure. Definately don't regret it. Characters you feel for, written extremely well.At first, I was frustrated... ""Don't put up with these behaviors"" I steamed at one of the characters. But the book pulls together it all intricately and beautifully, as you can only find in books, yet still amazingly realistically.Awesome book."
4,Great read--even if it's not entirely thought out,"I love this book! I 'm from that area, and I could identify with parts of both sisters, which was why I relished even the fights between them--in fact, one of my favorite bits was the cataclysmic confrontation between them at the end of Part I.The one thing that rings false with me is Maggie's dyslexia. I get the idea that there were better treatments for dyxlexia generally available then. I have had friends who were dyslexic in college and even graduate school, so I somehow don't see Maggie falling into the trap that she does in real life--at least not without finding out later that it was all a big unnecessary hassle that might have been avoided and yet another thing to be bitter about."
3,Funny- for two chapters!,"In Her Shoes By Jennifer Weiner.Starting as a rip-roaring funny story the first two chapters lead the reader to believe that the laugh will just keep on coming.It is not until you get comfortable with the idea of a good hilarious read that the story turns serious. But that doesn't distract from the enjoyment of the book.Telling the story of how two sisters come out of a difficult childhood it is easy to swing in favour of one sister to the other as their lives shoot off in to different directions.Funny, melancholic and thought provoking In Her Shoes is probably more suited to a female audience. You can almost picture Rene Zellwegger strutting her stuff in one of the leading roles as the story progresses to an unpredictable end."
2,Huge disappointment,"Did Publishers Weekly really call this book ""witty and original...a must-read"", as the book jacket says? I find that hard to believe. I liked Good in Bed, but this was a waste... Completely unbelievable and thoroughly unlikeable character of Maggie really doomed it. Ugh. The writing was much poorer than in the first book. Too bad."
4,Book Review,"In Her Shoes, is a novel about two sisters who have one thing in common; Family. As the novel progresses Rose goes through a mid life crisis, at the same time Maggie (Roses sister) begins to turn her life in the right direction. At the same time Ella the girls grandmother begins to move her life in the right direction, while doing things she never would have imagined.Jennifer Wiener combines different points of view so that the reader can better relate to one of the characters weather it's the smart, hard working, Rose, or the parting, and young, Maggie, to Ella the wise grandmother. Jennifer portrays the relationships between sisters so that an only child can understand the relationships between siblings. The unique writing style keeps the reader intrigued."
4,Excellent Follow Up to Good In Bed,"I am surprised to see so many ""so-so"" reviews on here for Jennifer Weiner's second book. After reading Good in Bed (which was my favorite book of the year way back when it first came out) I cold not wait to get my hands on her second novel. And, while it wasn't as good as the first (and honestly, I would be surprised if it was-- Good in Bed is truly a one of a kind novel)-- it was an excellent book... and better than any Marion Keyes or Sophie Kinsella you could pick up (by the way, i LOVE both of those authors). You will NOT be disappointed with In Her Shoes especially because Jennifer Wiener writes so effortlessly and so perfectly. Now... I'm just waiting patiently until next month when Little Earthquakes comes out! Don't be fooled by the somewhat negative reviews on here. Don't expect Good In Bed when you read In Her Shoes... and you won't be let down at all :)"
4,In Her Shoes,"Well, I'm actually reading this book right now, because it was recommended in this magazine I read. I'm reading it in hebrew, but by browsing in the author's website, I can see it's translated in her style, and really well - might I add.I really like the book, especially the parts with Ella. I'd defenatly recomend In Her Shoes."
4,"Not as good as ""Good in Bed"", but worth the read.","This was a good book, really. I guess after Good In bed, I expected it to be earthshattering, I did give it 4 stars, and they were worth it. The story was good. It was a good read."
2,Less than impressive,"I anticipated this novel to have some of the spark of the other chick-lit books I've been reading lately, but I ended up feeling disappointed. The writing was mediocre and I found myself questioning the believability of Maggie's character- she was like a charicature of what most women would like to believe beautiful women are- excessively hare-brained, manipulative, greedy, stuck-up. The book was a really fast read, but at many times during the readings I felt like stopping, and wondering if I should continue. I wasn't sure it was worth it to continue because I didn't feel very invested in any of the characters. The characters were kind of flat like soda that has been left out for too long, the writing full of cliches."
2,More whining by Weiner,More shallow 2 dimensional characters from Jennifer Weiner. The only interesting person in the book is the grandmother who acts as a sounding board for the messed up dyslexic whoring younger sister. I was not the least bit interested in the heroine nor her problems. COmpletely unsympathetic and uninteresting.Read Lynda Currnyn for much better chic lit with a tone of discovery.
3,Entertaining,"It is a fun novel ~~ one based on two sisters and their long-lost grandma with a family secret that only Grandma has the answers to. The two sisters, Maggie and Rose, raised by a grieving father and a distant step-mother, grew up different as sisters can be. Rose is the older sister, successful and one with the brains. Maggie is the scatterbrained younger sister with the looks to envy for. This novel is their stories ~~ fun, sometimes complicated and entertaining.This is a perfect summer read ~~ it's an entertaining tale about two sisters who never thought they'd be friends since they are so different. But deep down inside, they began to realize that they may be a like after all.So if you're looking for a fun book to read on the beach or on some dreary winter night ~~ this book is the perfect escape! It's enjoyable and funny in some parts! And sometimes, it will make you long for a sister as fun as Maggie and as responsible as Rose.1-10-05"
3,in her shoes-by sarah,"Rose feller is a 30-year-old lawyer for a big law firm in Philadelphia. She graduated from an ivy-league college with high grades. Anyone who met her would think her life was great-but it wasn't! She had a drop-dead gorgeous younger sister named Maggie who had so many boyfriends one time or another, she could no longer count. Maggie was a party-hardy bartender. Her beauty and fashion sense made rose jealous. Maggie's life wasn't perfect though. She was dyslexic and dropped out of college. These two ladies had nothing in common. Rose had to bail her sister out all the time. She finally got sick of it and kicked her to the curb. Maggie ran away, and finally got in touch with rose when she had made it all the way to Florida to see their grandma who they both didn't eve know they had. The sisters reunite to figure out family secrets. The book was okay and I hope that Jennifer Weiner makes a sequel so I can figure out how rose and Maggie made out in the end."
2,In Her Snooze,"This book was well-written, but a disappointing read. I never got a sense of the pain felt by Rose and Maggie over losing their mother. I found it unrealistic that their grandmother would have not made more attempts to stay in contact with her grandchildren. And I found the details of the main conflict between the two sisters - cheating with the other's boyfriend - ridiculous. If a guy were to sleep with his girlfriend's sister in that sister's apartment when he knows that his girlfriend is on the way home, it would be a quickie session that didn't involve taking off clothes and lingering in bed. I also find it hard to believe that a woman obsessed with shoes would own a pair of Payless shoes."
2,Good In Bed : Part 1 1/2 ?,"Weiner's sophomore effort should not disappoint believers of her debut novel, GOOD IN BED. She plays it safe - very safe - by even as going as far as bringing in the Cannie Shapiro character from her first novel, to let readers know she (Weiner) hasn't strayed from her formula. And that disappoints readers like myself, who enjoyed Weiner as a writer (America's Maive Binchey ?), but didn't love the plot. As with her debut novel, IN HER SHOES once again comes across as a good idea for a network sitcom - saccharine sweet, lighthearted, inoffensive, uneventful, and rather brain numbing."
3,"Four star story, two star ending","Weiner definitely is one of the deeper writers of the chick-lit genre and has a gift for telling stories. Her characters are well-flushed out: I especially found the different sides of Maggie's personality intriguing. Her portrait of the sisters' relationship is quite compelling. However, there are some obvious flaws: Ella (the enstranged grandmother) seems to be consumed with guilt that's out of proportion to what happened with her daughter. After building a really intriguing story, Weiner seems to have a rather slap-dash ending where all of a sudden one character gets engaged and the other becomes responsible with very little developement. All in all, I liked this book and give it a beach-reading approval rating, but it doesn't make it into my favourites catagory."
4,Good read.,"After reading 'Good In Bed' I was very eager to read this book. This book is definitely worth picking up. My only problem with the book was Maggie was just such an unsympathetic character! I'd find myself getting irritated with Rose for putting up with so much [...] and being a doormat. But don't get me wrong, I liked this book and would recommend it."
2,hopeless,"can someone please tell me why this book became and bestseller AND A MOVIE??? i was irritated by the trite plot and its shallow characters and had to force myself through it. don't get me wrong, i'm always up for a fun, light read but this was just too mindless to bare. don't buy it!"
4,Not Your Usual Chick Lit,"This novel is more about the relationship of two sisters than it is a romantic comedy. And it is more layered and emotionally involving than the usual ""chick lit"" such as The Devil Wears Prada or The Nanny Diaries or Elegance. I read it in one sitting, so it clearly isn't hard to digest, but it stayed with me. I wondered which of us could be as forgiving as Rose, even though the author eventually showed that Maggie was more sympathetic a character than first perceived. With its neatly tied up ending, it's easy to see why Hollywood snapped up the rights. I now will make an effort to watch the DVD. Comment: I found 4 or 5 mistakes that an editor should have caught, especially by the time the book went into soft copy. This seems to be a hallmark of best sellers, these days..."
5,This is a great piece of work...,"I purchased this CD after hearing ""Snakebite"" playing on my local Detroit smooth jazz station. And despite some of the mediocre reviews, this is an excellent piece of work, don;t let anyone fool you. People reminiscing and comparing Lorber's work from bygone decades serve no purpose if you want to hear some superlative work that is infectious, fun, and extremely well produced. Buy it, you won't regret it."
2,Playing it safe,"Man,this guy's stuff has sure left me flat over the last 10-15 years.When he collaborated with great R&B singers(some of the names escape me now,but Audrey Wheeler was one),Manhattan Transfer,and The System back in the 80's,he was a top funkasizin' son of a behotch.He's either sold out and went Kenny G,or he's just uninspired.Case in point-my favorite tune(might not be yours,but I hope it's up there) from this one is the title track,written with the amazing Robbie Nevil.I think he should get back to producing other artists."
2,Hazard to Pets!,"I bought this gate to keep my puppy out of a carpeted room. It's easy to install and is fairly sturdy, although not as sturdy as some metal gates I've seen. The problem is that it's a hazard to pets. Rather than jumping over it, my cat squeezed through the bars and just barely made it. Squeezing through the bars like that could cause him to strangle himself in the future. Also, the door closes and latches on its own only if you open it all the way then let it go, but even then the latch doesn't always catch. The door slams shut with such force that it could injure any pet or small child that gets in the way. I'm returning it today...definitely not worth the money."
2,Not Summer's Best Gate,"This gate does not feel sturdy and doesn't close automatically as easily as the Parents Infant Deluxe Walk-Thru Gate. I don't like this gate and don't recommend it. It is functional and will protect your little from getting into an off-limits area, but I recommend you get the Deluxe version of the gate."
3,Good book but lacking,This book is very imformative and educational but I don't recommend this as an animation handbook. It offers very helpful hints and displays various animation styles. I don't think it will teach you much on how to animate. More like a reference and animation library than a how to book. Great read and somewhat obsolete.
3,Concise and Diverse,"The book is concise and covers the entire spectrum of animation. It is consistent with others in the Encyclopedia of Art Series. For animation students it is a good introductory book, but you will find yourself needing more information soon."
5,Couldn't be better,My two four year olds love this toy. It is packaged well for storage when not in use. Nothing has broken (owned for 10 months) and they can clean it up and get it out on their own. They can follow the picture instructions with minimal help. This is by far the best toy we have bought in a long time. Even my [...] and her friends love it.
3,Good flick,"This is a good movie. Martin Landau does a good job, & John Garzarian also does a good job. Lindasy's direction isn't bad, & I love the video cover with John with the gun!"
4,Teil Convert,"I really like the Ethere! I had tried Sirene and loved it and decided to give Vicky Tiel another try. I was not disappointed! The only thing I regret, is that her other frangrance of the set, is not sold separately. I also like the cool bottles!"
3,Not quite Bisnation...but not bad,"Veering from their usual formula, Bis finds themselves in a techno setting for 'Music For A Stranger World'. While the lack of guitars and usual breakneck beats aren't exactly abound here, Bis still manage to try things musically that most wouldn't dare think of. 'Are You Ready?', clearly the best of the batch, is anthemic and is deserved single status. 'Dead Wrestlers' is musically melancholy and a little silly, but still somewhat clever...in that Bis kind of way. Hopefully, this isn't the direction the band will continue in, but, for an experimental ep, it's not a bad place to visit. But...a message to Manda, Steven and John: Bring those guitars back and lay off the sequencers for a little while."
4,"""Dead Wrestlers"" is the best song ever.","What a great song. Probably one of the best songs that I've ever heard. The rest of the EP is good even though I don't think that they could ever write a song as good as ""Dead Wrestlers"" again. That's the only thing. If every song by Bis was as good as this song, they'd be the best band ever. All of my friends like this song, even though they don't like dance-pop. The difference between this and radio dance pop is that this is actually intelligent. Something in music that I've been looking for quite a while for."
4,"""Your politics are pantomime..."" (!)","The opener ""Dead Wrestlers"" is a track that should be played (and probably will be) over and over and over and over again. One of the best pop songs of the last ten years or so. I have to be honest and say I haven't heard the other tracks more than once or twice, a shame really , but that's how overpowering ""Dead Wrestlers"" is. I keep setting the player back to ""1"" and enjoying. I just wish there were a couple of extra verses in it. But as for the other tracks ""I Want It All"" and ""How Can we Be Strange"" also sound promising. This was my first Bis CD. It won't be my last."
2,Too Big for Bottles is just really Too Little,"I ordered this book in hopes that Baby Cookie and Baby Bird could help me convince my 2 year old that he was indeed too big for bottles. I read this book at least once a day (my choice, not my son's) to him, and he paid attention to the story. But he wasn't convinced this book had anything to do with his addiction to the bottle. He just didn't empathize at all. I think he is too young. Some other toddlers may have more empathy, and perhaps this book would work for those particular children.Plus, this book is not worth the money. It's only like 8 pages or so long. It's very skimpy.I wouldn't even call it entertaining."
5,Great Adventure,"So, this series revolves around a boy that becomes involved in a adventure that he is the key too, although, not at first. One by one, the main body of characters filter in. This is a fan service series, but wouldn't call it harem. Not too many adult situations minus drinking and some minor obscenities, but you can see worse on daytime drama. Each character has a back story that gets filled in, but also, you get to watch the growth of defining characteristics that existed. The ditsy blonde just adds so much like Brittany is to Glee."
2,good but not great,"I want to start by saying i am a big fan of Steve Earle. That being said i found this dvd to be mostly uninspired. Steve seems almost tired and struggles to reach his notes vocally for most of the performance. He just seems kind of burnt out or something. At one point in the show you actually see someone in the audience yawn really big & that is kind of telling of this performance. I was touched emotionally by ""Goodbye"" and from then on out the performance gathers some steam and is pretty good actually. It's just too bad it took Steve almost 3/4 of the way through the show to really start getting into it and making us feel something."
5,Best Value for the Price,"NO Shotgun, for me at least, out performed all other pre-lifts. I have used Black Powder, which did help me get more reps but does not assist in actual power gains. With NO Shotgun I was immediately able to rep ~20 more lbs on my bench press, and after I stopped use of the product I did not lose any mass/power. If you're looking for a product which will help you get stronger faster, and provides you with an extremely fast recovery this is for you. If you want something that will help you get in endurance shape, I would lean more towards Black Powder, however that will end up costing you 20-30 dollars more per month."
2,wouldn't suggest this,"Tried it doesn't work for me. I get the tingle in the skin, but no extra energy. Cant seem to get a good pump either. Mixes grainy. The grape bubblegum flavor isn't bad."
2,Not my favorite pre-workout,"I've tried a slew of pre-workout supps over the past 6 years. I have returned to some older favorites and tried newer brands on other people's recommendations. Just beware of what people say (even me) because pre-workouts work vastly differently depending on who is taking it. No brand will work the same for every person who ingests it.NO Shotgun V3 left me with a feeling of ""unwellness"". Seriously, I do not know how else to describe it. It didn't give me much energy or pump, and I always ensure my sleep, calories (especially carbs) are high, and I am well-hydrated at all times. Usually that's enough for a pre-workout to work for me, but this one still didn't cut it.I didn't like the taste or the aftertaste. I felt okay during the workout, but I didn't feel well afterward. I have since switched back to an old favorite which tastes and works better for me. The only problem now is that I am up all night after my workouts."
2,No Pump,I really liked the original Jack3D (before they changed their formulation). I have taken Redline before so I expected a lot more energy and pump from this product. The energy impact of Shotgun NO I find to be fairly mellow and I would rather drink a cup of coffee before a workout. As to the 'pump' it was mild and I barely feel the NO tingling that I associated with it. I would pass on this. I am up to 2.5 scoops with a poor return.
3,"Weird flavor, contains caffeine.","I had my husband use Shotgun and give me his opinion on it since caffeine triggers migraines with me. He liked the product but found the grape bubblegum flavor odd, but not entirely unpalatable. While he's not a fan of caffeine either, he was able to tolerate Shotgun without ill effects.What I did like was during the short time he used Shotgun, I did notice some good muscle results on him I had not otherwise seen before. We workout off and on and he usually can drop weight quickly, but muscles are hard to build on him. Shotgun, I feel, actually gave him somewhat better results than not. It was an unexpected but welcome surprise.Shotgun seems to be a decent product and worth trying if you can get past the unusual but not too bad grape bubblegum flavor. As with any these kind of products, your results may vary."
4,"NO, 20 Grams of protein, need I say more?","I tried this product several times, and every time I stop and use something else I find myself asking why did I switch. It is not the strongest NO supplement out there, but it does provide enough energy for a workout and then there is the 20 grams of protein you get with it which makes this product worth it. For the price, you cant go wrong since you get all the necessary ingredients on one serving (Check the label)."
2,Why grape bubble-gum flavor?,"For better or worse, this drink tastes exactly as advertised -- grape bubblegum. Why grape bubblegum and not a more pleasing and traditional chocolate or vanilla smoothie like other muscle-building powders? I don't know, but grape bubblegum is not high on my list of desirable flavors. Made according to the proportions of powder and water, I found the taste overly sweet and unappealing. I was unable to get through more than one glass of it. Even diluted to 3x the amount of water, the taste was still rather unappetizing. I could not get past the flavor of this product to continue using it. Other people, however, may like the taste. A co-worker in my department, who is a certified fitness instructor, or example, said he didn't mind the taste. He didn't love it, but he didn't find it as repulsive as I did."
2,Way to much to handle,"I took this expecting great results and that is not what I got. I have used superpump and NO-Xplode and with out a doubt I will be sticking with those. I literally felt like I was on cocaine when I took this and I only took half a scoop! I only took it twice and felt weird for days after taking it. Couldnt sleep, shakes, stomach ache. It all sucked! But, apparently it works for most people I just didnt react well with it apparently."
5,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS REALLY WORKS .....AMAZING PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!...NO JITTERS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT JUST LASER FOCUS AND INTENSE WORKOUTS THAT ARE OFF THE CHART .....HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
3,HULK SMASH!!!!,"great stuff. feel like you can rip a door off the hinges.mix it with more water than it says, otherwise it tastes like WAAAAY oversugared koolaide..."
2,Honestly I can't tell a difference either way,"After using this for more than a month, I still have yet to feel or see a difference compared to not using it. It does not give me any additional endurance for a strength work out and certainly none for a cardio/strength workout or straight cardio. I also do not see any difference after the workout in terms of building muscle mass any faster than I was before.On the positive side it does not taste bad and it did not make me jittery at all, which I was concerned about. But, ultimately, it is around 70 calories that doesn't seem to be doing any good so I can not recommend it from my experiences."
2,After taste,"After drinking this I wonder if the productis very safe, they sure didn't do much tastetesting. I can drink it mixed with fruit juice, but alonethe after taste haunts me.I have noticed no muscle change ( yet at least)and it is a product that it probably going to stayon my shelf."
3,an acquired taste,"Basically, this is a powder mix for one of those caffeinated energy drinks.Based on the packaging, I was expecting something more akin to a protein powder. Kinda think, creamy, smooth, etc. WRONG! It has a strong sharp flavor just like an energy drink. Regardless, I slammed it down and now I have some pretty interesting jitters.I will not mix this with water again. It would go great with vodka. Definitely vodka. Not tequila, not rum. Vodka.Maybe I'll use it in home made ice cream too. That should be interesting.Did I say jitters?Yow"
1,"Be very, very careful!!","Be very, very careful when you use this product! When I first used the product I read the product info on the bottle. The product information said use no more than one scoop. I always use caution so I took 1/2 scoop. Within 30 minutes I was shaking like a leaf. This product didn't help me get a pump. I couldn't even lift the weights. I didn't get a wink of sleep that night. It took 36 hours to feel normal again. O.K. I'm not 20 anymore. Maybe if I was young I could take it. But, for me, this product was ""NO-help""."
2,Good but not great,"I have used about 4 different pre-workout supplements before I used this product (Jack3d, Super Charged Extreme NO, NoXplode, and Black Powder). This was my least favorite. It does not seem to sustain me through a full workout like the others I have used. It taste the worst by far! I have also gotten tingling sensations (not the good kinds, more like needles) from using this all over. I do not recommend this product at all. My favorite product so far has been Black Powder, it cost more but I have had better results and no side effects using it. Good luck!"
3,not a bad product if you like stimulants supplements,"taste decent but you have to take at least 3 scoop for it to give you that "" kick"" energy boost."
3,Can't get past the taste,"I really wanted to like this product, but I just can't. I wanted to be able to give a thorough testing and give it at least a balanced review, but I can't. At least not now.The problem is that I can't stomach the taste of this product. It tastes like really sweet bubble gum and that's not the taste I want when I'm chugging down 8-10 ounces of this stuff before or after a workout (or when I make the mistake of taking this with me on a run). To make things worse, I couldn't get the powder to fully dissolve. The instructions are to mix 1 scoop with 8-10 ounces of water but even with 16 ounces, I was still getting mouthfuls of undissolved nasty-tasting grit. The bad taste is one thing, but adding that ""too much Kool-Aid, not enough water"" texture doesn't help at all.I have a full canister of this stuff, so I'm sure I'll give it another go at some point to keep from wasting it, but I'm really disappointed in my experience with it so far."
2,"Decent Results, Bad Taste","First and foremost, this supplement is a hard swallow; the mixture is very thick and strong to the point that I had to double check to make sure I had the right mixture of water. And the grape flavor is very strong on has a bubblegum flavor to it. Once you can get it down, it gives a decent result, but I found that I would skip the supplement more and more often before workouts because of the taste."
5,no-x results,"I've started using No-x shotgun on the 7th of december 2009 in combination with nitro-tech hardcore protein in my daily trainings and plus with a dieet plan. I'm a 62kg, 5ft 7"" guy with a waist of size 30 sow it wasn't hard for me to get nice formed abs but i did have a little belly fat and in those 2 weeks and a half i've managed to make my abs appear more and using no-x shogun in training gives you the extra lasting energy to do a good hard training and feel that your muscles stay hard. Give it a try with your trainig and see how it can make a difference for you!"
4,It has pros and cons.,"Let me start out by saying that I use 10-15% of the recommended dose.Pros-I'm totally out of shape, and this gave me the boost I needed to get back in the gym and establish a gym habit.It has a nice energy boost that translates to more reps and longer duration of workouts.The boost lasts longer than I am in the gym, so I feel great for about 6 hours after taking it.Cons-The taste is sort of rough.38% of your RDA sodium in one serving. The other ingrediants also raise your BP, so if you are on any sort of heart meds or any med that regulates/raises BP, talk to your Doc.Like many other reviews, this product made me a little gassy.Given my body weight and my dosage of Shotgun, I would need to drink 1.3 gallons of water. That ain't going to happen. Makes me a little paranoid about what the product might do to my kidneys/liver. I'll find out in six months when I get my blood checked.OVERALLIt's a good buy, but be careful!"
5,Great Stuff,This stuff is just as good now as it was in the 80's.Melts in your mouth & has chocolate chips.They usually ship out in 1 or 2 days.
2,Dry ice cream,I could taste the choco chip flavor but three of the five children did not like itThey said it tasted chalky
1,OUT OF DATE!!!,"The 4th edition of this ""Collectors Handbook"" is a reprint of earlier editions rather than a much needed rewrite.The background information provided in this book IS very interesting and helpful. HOWEVER, the first question asked on the back of this book is ""What is the value of an Audubon Print?"" This book answers that question with print by print price information (almost 1/3 of the book) that is over 20 years old. NO price information is even given for the Octavo prints.As a guide for collectors looking for current value information for Audubon prints this book is worthless."
4,Great series,"I like this series for homeschool language arts, but don't think I need the teacher books."
5,"A winner, one of the best regencies ever written!","If you read one book by Edith Layton, read this one. Regina, the heroine, is a woman on the cusp of a delimima, starve and be virtuous, or accept the protection of Jason, Duke of Torquay. The conversations/decisiions between Regina and Jason are some of the best ever written in a romance novel. This ranks close to Georgette Heyer's best such as ""The Devil's Cub"" or ""These Old Shades"". Jason shows multiple sides to his personality as he finds himself both wanting Regina and hoping she will continue to decline his offer. If you have read her other books and wondered about who the Duke of Torquay was....then this is one you should read."
2,"With ""heroes"" like that...","who needs villains! Oh sure, Torquay ""reformed"" at the end, but only after he had put Regina through sheer hell. St. John was even worse, because he was lying to her the whole time. Why on earth was Regina attracted to a man who treated her like dirt?! He was disgusting! I gave this two stars because it was well written for what it was. I just could not like the characters, or the romance."
4,it's a good grill,it's a good grill but only if buy it from amazon.com.the only thing bothers me is that it is ver ugly.
3,Durability?,"I've had my grill for about 5 months and used it no more than 20 times and I have some concerns about its durability. The detachable plastic spatter shield broke after about 4 months, but luckily it isn't a critical component. The nonstick surface is showing signs of wear already. There are small, raised, ""spacing bumps"" along the cooking surface and the coating has completely worn away from them, showing the aluminum underneath. I can also see a couple shiny spots in the rest of the cooking surface, where the coating is thinning. I recommend using only a sponge if you hand wash. Lastly, this grill will splash some oil from the sides when cooking burgers, so you might want to make some additional cardboard splashguards to keep cleanup to a minimum."
1,Great grill! While it worked...,"This grill performed flawlessly for about 6 months. I used it about once every two weeks to cook a large batch of chicken breasts.I was very pleased with it and even wrote a 5-star review for Amazon.Then, one day out of the blue and right in the middle of a grilling session, it just stopped working. I shipped it to my local service center for warranty repair, but they told me it was not repairable and T-Fal would be sending me a replacement in 3 to 6 weeks. Not that terrible, but not exactly very impressive service either.And one wonders how on Earth anybody manages to manufacture an electric grill that can't even work 6 months without breaking down; we're not talking cutting-edge electronics here!This grill deserves a 5 star rating... when it works. Unfortunately my recent experience (which seems to be corroborated by at least a few other reviewers) indicates this is not a reliable product, and warranty service has room for improvement. Stay away from it."
1,Really awful,"I bought this book because I saw it had been recommended as a good summer read by some talk show hosts, and am thoroughly skeptical now about their book picks. Apologies to the author for what was I'm sure a lot of work, the writing style is juvenile, the characters are weak, and the ""thriller"" was not thrilling. I've read a lot of great easy summer books in the last few years - pass on this one and get Skinny Dip instead."
2,An easy but dull read....,"An easy read but a dull read. I'm starting to feel like author's are thinking of good titles, or a good premise or synopsis material, and then wrapping them in a story that just doesn't come through. This book is an example of that. You stick the word ""abortionist"" in the title and it gets people's attention! ""Abortionist's daughter"", ah, even better! Then we're presented with this tired story full of characters (characterizations, really) we care little about and a mystery about as obvious as an episode of Scooby Doo. The only good thing I can say is because it's an easy read, you'll probably only have to suffer through it for one weekend."
2,No surprises here,"You can tell that Elisabeth Hyde has done her ""Creative Writing"" homework.Rule #1: For a classic whodunnit you need to develop several suspects, and hey, the most obvious suspects turn out to be innocent, of course.Rule #2: Be specific. That's probably why we learn what everybody in the book is eating (Top Ramen soup being a favorite) and wearing (layering is crucial for menopausal women, just in case you didn't know or never wanted to know).Rule #3: Be at least a little daring. That's where drugs, oral sex, abortions etc. come in.It looks like this book has all the ingredients, and still fails to make good on its promise. The characters remain strangely one-dimensional and stereotypical. So does the plot. While reading I was really trying to shake that constant deja-vu feeling and hoping for at least one unexpected twist. It wasn't meant to happen."
4,Engrossing Summer Read,"This book is a thinking person's who done it. The psychological motivations of the characters seem sincere and well thought out. The issues of family dynamics, work and abortion work well to bind the book into an entity greater than the sum of its parts."
3,"Good read, but not in the ""could not put down"" category","This was not a book that I would rush home to read. Surely not a book that I would ignore chores for, ignore sleep for, or give up dinner for. The story of the Murder of Dr. Duprey, the abortion doctor was somewhat intriguing, the family dynamics were interesting, and the stalker dude was weird as hell. But, at the end, it was a little more disappointing."
2,The Abortionists Daughter,At first I thought I wasn't going to enjoy THE ABORTIONIST'S DAUGHTER. It seemed to be more about family relationships than murder. However it didn't take long to discover that the family dynamics help inform the murder investigation.THE ABORTIONIST'S DAUGHTER is written on a number of levels. First and foremost is the murder of Diana and the investigation. We learn the family's back-story and what happened to bring them to this point in time. It is also an exploration of an extremely emotive issue from both sides of the argument into which is cleverly woven a theme of the nature of obsession and what it can do to people.THE ABORTIONIST'S DAUGHTER is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. There are many who may find parts of the book offensive and many more who will be upset by it.Hyde has written three other novels; each examining different aspects of family relationships. Her website is [...]
3,A Good Read,"This book was good enough to read all the way through, which is sometimes a problem for me, but overall I wasn't blown away. Overall I liked it enough to recommend to anyone who thinks they might be interested."
1,Not Much Mystery to This Mystery,"I was quite disappointed in this book. Based on the professional reviews I had read, I expected a better, more absorbing story. First of all, I could not find a single character in this book that I liked, much less related to. From the ecstasy-popping daughter of the title to the fanatical ""Reverend,"" I found I didn't really care what happened to ANY of them. Secondly, I thought that maybe the provocative title meant that the book would make me think about my own position on abortion and why I feel that way, but there was nothing there I hadn't already considered. In the end, the doctor's chosen speciality had nothing to do with her murder, which made me wonder why the author even chose to make her an abortionist. What was the point?"
2,Somewhat disappointed,"After reading the great reviews, I was really looking forward to this book. But I was disappointed. The author's prose was excellent, and the story well conceived. But the only compelling character happens to be the victim, Dr. Diana Duprey, whose story is told through flashbacks. She is a multi-layered and very interesting character. Her husband Frank is bland, and her daughter Megan is a spoiled brat. I wanted to reach out and choke her halfway through the book. The ""romance,"" if you can call it that, between Megan and the detective seemed unnecessary and not believable. I also saw the ending coming a mile away. I kept waiting for a twist at the end, but it didn't come."
3,"Interesting characters, engrossing read","I particularly appreciated Hyde's rendering of a longtime marriage with unresolved conflicts, which rang very true. As did the relationship between Diana Duprey and her daughter. A minor complaint: an autopsy report indicates that Diana had sex near the end of her life, but unless I missed something, this element is left dangling."
3,parts are too hard to believe...,"i know it is fiction but am I supposed to care about a detective who can't control his sexual urges when confronted with a 19-yr old girl who may be a murder suspect? and are we supposed to believe that a homicide detective is 26 years old? if they are in Colorado, maybe that is whatJo Benet case was such a mess..."
2,Could've been good...,"I got halfway through this book and had to put it down. The characters were not sympathetic or even likeable. There were times that I could feel the author using her ""skills"" -- descriptive phrases and throwaway lines that felt too forced and technical and interrupted the flow of the story. At one point I thought, Wow--she must have used that in a different story in some writing class! Then, half-way through the book I could see what was coming, and just decided that I couldn't spend more time on the story when I could already see the outcome. I read ahead some and skimmed the last few pages and was not at all surprised by whodunit. This is the second book by this author that I have read, and I come away from this one feeling the same way I did about the first. Maybe one day she will break out and have a fantastic and moving story, but right now her stuff is just good 'nuff...just not for me."
2,"Entertaining, but very predictable","This book was entertaining and fairly well written. It was a vacation read for me and I got through it in a few days. The characters are well developed and I found myself caring about them. Sadly, by the second day of reading, I was able to predict the ending."
3,Took a long time to get into,"I had read this book almost halfway through before I began to get into it, but then I really liked it. The first part actually annoyed me a little bit; the gratuitous sex and drugs, the shallow characterization and seemingly pointless drabble made me wonder if they story was ever going to pick up. I eventually came to care for Huck and Megan and enjoyed the last half of the book immensely."
4,A good novel to occupy your day,"This novel from Elisabeth Hyde was the perfect book to blitz through in one day's reading on a just-concluded vacation. I think Publishers' Weekly review hit the nail on the head when they said that ""rather than generating suspense, the murder provides a frame for the turbulence in and around a woman propelled by idealism and strongly held beliefs."" Agreed. In a bit of a twist on the normal structure of stories of this ilk, the murder gets solved about 30 pages from book's end, at which point Hyde doubles back and plays out the final day of Dr. Duprey's life. It's a microcosm of the forces that have buffeted every day of her life.This was my first experience reading Ms. Hyde's work. I'll surely consider her earlier efforts."
1,Doesn't work yet,this came to me very dirty. When I opened it a hair ball came out with dirt all over it! Then I had to get all the different cables and still had to download the drivers.Finding the drivers was a significant task. I still haven't got it working yet. I need to find the drivers I downloaded and then try it out again. That's what I get for buying used electronics!
1,hodgman boot hanger,Worst product I have ever purchased. The boots fall out of the hanger about every 10 minutes and land on the floor..told the people who sent it to me and they did do anything ..guess they didnt care...the surfaces need to be some type of rough surface that grips the boot....these are smooth as glass and the boot just keeps sliding out...i know this is a waste of time but at least i got to vent my frustration.Hodgman Boot and Wader Hanger
5,Does what it's supposed to do,"I bought two sets from Sports Authority. They were $2.99 each on sale. Unfortunately I got the last two they had. The ""standard"" price seems to be $5 - $10. Dick's has the same product (different ""brand"") however identical in appearance for $12.99. I have no complaints. My waders have been hanging for three days now without falling on the floor. For a ""no frills"" approach to hanging up waders, and at $5 or so the product is a bargain."
2,Better for Britons,"This book is interesting, yet focuses primarily on sports business in the UK, and particularly in regard to dealings with soccer clubs. But in terms of applicability to the US market, it's mostly interesting only as a tangential reference."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this, and then realized it needed a control unit to make it work. So I went back to Amazon to purchase one and it said ""out of stock"", I kept checking back, and now they have quit carrying the control unit. The only one I've found is over $250.00! And I had to search very hard to even find one, so I returned product and had to 17.00 more for shipping! :( It was a waste of time and money!"
1,JUNK!,"As they say, you get what you pay for. This fell apart a week after getting it. Had to throw it away."
2,Somewhat Helpful but Disappointing,"One of the best things about the book was it mentioning to do the NCAA 101. Unfortunately, you cannot do that in the game! Having the information available about the schools (over half of the book) and their favorite plays was helpful. So was the descriptions of the plays. However, the play images did not include player movement, which is crucial -- there is no excuse to ""save space"" for such crucial information -- one of the big reasons for such books is to be able to carry it and not have to have the game in front of you. The instructions and strategy are good, but not great. Helpful but disappointing."
2,Not worth the money,"If you have any understanding of football then this book is of little to no value for you. It has alot of general information, but the NCAA101 on the game is alot more informative on how to do actual plays."
2,Nothing but crumbs,"These rice cakes have very little flavor and are very crumbly. I have thrown away the equivelent to 2 from all of the crumbs. The flavor is barely there and tastes more like a rice cake than the flavor says. I will go back to the Quaker brand, they are worth the extra money."
4,"Very Good, Fresh, Tasty","I like to munch on these when I just HAVE to have a snack, but don't need extra fat and calories. I've ordered several flavors from Amazon and this vendor, and have been pleased with all of them. I always have a bag tucked away in the kitchen and workshop to make it easy to grab a snack that won't damage my waistline :-)"
2,not insightful,"This book gives you an overview of the topic but does not go any deeper. The exercises are way too easy and does not help you grasp the topic. If you are a curious learner, this book is not for you. The book is also monotonous and boring but is written in plain English and is easy to understand."
2,Boy was I surprised!,When a I received a large box containing only a 40-page booklet. $7.90 to ship a $3.95 booklet when perhaps 2 or 3 first class stamps would have sufficed. The booklet cover states a $4.99 value which I find to be a stretch only because Grizzly opted to ship the booklet in a box which could of contained 50 or more copies. Ouch!
1,BS,I have worked with the Disney Co. and found that the authors should write for a tabloid magazine. This is just another poor attempt at bashing Disney. In every incident the truth is or seems to be twisted to fit the author's version of what goes on behind the scenes. Please do not give up your hard-earned dollars for this waste of paper.One star is too much!
1,What Trash! Can't Believe It Was Even Published!,"The authors of this extended diatribe against the Disney Company claim to have written a book based on fact, not on opinion. Nothing is further from the truth. Every page of this book betrays their right-wing agenda, how Disney is betraying our children, with the obligatory gay-bashing of the Christian right (To set the record straight (no pun intended!) Disney doesn't even sponsor ""Gay Day"", it just sorta happens!).Don't waste your money on this trash. Read Carl Hiaasen's clever (and critical!) book instead."
1,"Not journalism, mostly editorial opinion of sparse facts","At first I found this book appealing and informative (up to Part III), however, halfway through this book I realized that the authors were trying to slam their political beliefs down the public's throat with Disney as a vehicle for such action. Yes, there is documented truth in this book - and it would have been a better book if they had just presented the facts and let everyone draw their own conclusions. Instead, the authors chose to draw those conclusions for you, making it a highly political piece of editorialism that makes the reader wish they purchased another book. This is NOT journalism, just a small sampling of facts and moralistic opinions drawn from the authors."
1,Mouse bashing!,"Obviously these authors have a grudge against Disney and are out to make a cheap buck. I question the geniunity of the ""documents"" and the ""interviews"" with the ""sources."" When a company or person becomes very big and powerful and well respected by many it becomes fair game to people who want to tear it down, unfortunately. I am not saying the Disney does not have some skeltons in its closet (what company doesn't?) but I think this was blown WAY out of proportion."
1,Don't waste your money!,The author claims this is a work of journalism...don't believe it. It is all conjecture and rumor. Very poorly written...A basic hack job.
5,COURAGEOUS RENDITION OF THE TRUTH ABOUT DISNEY,"Peter Schweizer and Rochelle Schweizer exercised great courage to step up against a major conglomerate like Disney to finally reveal the truth in a well-written, precise and intelligent book that is a must read for all Americans. I give this book 5 stars and recommend it for all parents. This is a great book!"
2,important journalism mixed with agenda-driven politics,"Part of this book is simply the tired mouth-covered-in-horror conservative sermonizing, with more than a dash of homophobia. To imply that Disney is somehow subverting its mission of entertaining children by owning a film distribution company that deals in more adult fare, for example, is muddled thinking. And the authors seem horrified that Disney treats gays like actual people. But the chapters that detail the cover-up of accidents, use of sweatshop labor and plagiarism are important and solid reporting. It's too bad that the book isn't half as long as it is. That much of it is a story that needs to be told. The rest is dismissable."
5,Great Book on the Real Disney Empire,"This book is a great book on ther real Disney empire. Some of the incidents at Disney would make Bill Clinton and Larry Flynt blush.Sodomy, Pedophilia,Peeping Toms,Employees exposing themselves- Walt Disney musy be turning in his grave! ABC was going to run a report based on the book until big daddy Eisner stopped it! Its not the same Disney that I grew up with! It gives more substance to the boycotts."
3,Objective Attempt,"This book begins with an objective attempt to prove Disney is involved with questionable practices. The book's proof is several confidential Disney documents, which ironically, the publisher must have obtained through their own questionable practices. Unfortunately, the second half of the book gives way to subjective data and opinions which simply places it in the same category as the myriad of other books attempting to discredit Disney. Could be disturbing if you choose to believe it all, but bottom line is that Disney always tries to protect its public image."
2,Not What I Expected,"I grew up in Orlando, FL the home of Mickymouse. I hated how much our city depended on tourism and have an innate dislike for super corporations. Where a compay is to big to fail, to big to be sued and has their own police force there's bound to be corruption. However the conservative, self-ritious tone of the author had me actually defending Disney at times. The author longs for a world of bubbles and sunshine and is appauled when it is not. The authors take offence at anyone who trys to depict the lives of children as anything other than happy and innocent. For that reason I could not enjoy the some of the better parts of the book in which they discuss the issues that matter."
1,Journalism? I think not,"What a piece of trash. I cannot believe that I bought the book. I admit that I work for WDW, and at first I was intriqued to see some of the secrets of Disney revealed but realized the authors main goal was to push there hatred of Disney onto the reader. I seriously question how the authors obtained police and internal Disney documents.I have worked for Disney for 10 years and never have seen anything that would lead me to belive that it is this ""all powerful evil empire"".Can a company that spreads so much joy and happiness and does a excellent job of telling good stories to young an old really be that evil?-eric"
2,Why do Americans love to deface their icons so?,"Disney is a corporation, in the business of making money. One could tie any organization with bad business ideas or unfavorable business tactics if you try hard enough. People expect too much from Disney, we shouldn't look to a company for our own standards of morality. This book blames Disney for trying to make money any way it can, isn't that what all of us do, and what the author is trying to accomplish?"
1,should have been at the check out stand of a grocery store,"The book while entertaining, does not contain complete information. In some portions of the book, it quotes people who confessed to crimes and aberant behavior. In others it only addresses one side of the story. hence half information, half truth. Anything that is a half truth is at best a lie. The whole story should be published. In the section about the fire department, it only quotes some employees who have had axes to grind, and less than desireable employment histories. It does not interview or attempt to address the views of the people accused of the acts."
5,Judge for yourselves,"This book is not an easy work. Its contents are at times graphic and disgusting. It includes photocopies of several police reports, court hearings, etc. Certainly, this is not something for Disney fans, but something for people who are interested in truth, more so than money, fun, and entertainment. If what the book says is true, and with all the proof included, I wouldn't see why not, then Disney is to be avoided by all means, boycotted, and shut down. But judge for yourselves. No one wants you to believe anything without evidence. Pick up the book, read it, and see for yourselves if it's an honest account or not."
2,"Tons of ""I hate Disney"" Opinion","While I would still buy this book again, I would say that you have to prepare yourself for all of the anti-Disney opinion. You should know that some of the stories, as well as the way Disney handles ""problems"" in the park, are typical. What business wouldn't want to hide away a problem--they're bad for business. In the end, I would recommend you purchase this book if only to laugh at some of the stories."
2,A BAD MEMOIR,"I really like Phil Silvers, and grew up with the platoon and his Sgt Bilko character. He was wonderful as the con man and his foil, Col JT Hall. I bought the book, and was not happy with its poor writing and very little to say about his show, and more about his earlier life and entry into show business."
5,Well written and very engrossing,"This book collects a fine, five-issue mini-series that gives Doc Ock his most in-depth origin story yet. Going back to Otto Octavius's preschool days, the first chapter shows him as a pudgy egghead, tormented by cruel kids and big bullies all the way through high school. A side story about an abusive, insensitive ogre of a father rings a bit false, but otherwise the lengthy comparison between Ock's miserable school years and Peter Parker's is an interesting touch.Mainly it's the quality of the writing and artwork that stand out here; this is a very wordy, yet totally engrossing story, well complimented by Kaare Andrews' fine, fluid artwork. I was glued to this book from start to finish, and thought it was an excellent addition to the ongoing Spider-man saga. Recommended!"
3,A new Year One for an Old Foe!,"The Year One subtitle automatically brings to mind ""Batman: Year One."" Every hero has had one, but they never do a comic that focuses on year one for the villains. Okay well rarely. In Doctor Octopus Year One we see young Otto Octavius and all the issues he deals with that make him the shy introverted genius that creates his famous robotic arms. We also see the change in his personality after his accident, but Zeb Wells made it very organic. And I love Kaare Andrews artstyle. It's classic and yet modern. He captures early Spidey and Doc Ock to perfectly and the writing is very good. You almost feel bad for Otto...almost. If you're a Spiderman fan this is definitely worth a read."
4,It's About Time!!,"After searching for several years for a Christmas craft book that is simple enough for the average person to follow, Martha Stewarts ""Parties and Projects for the Holidays"" hit the spot. She does an excellent job of illustrating the instructions to make them easy to follow. She also included some great crafts for children of all ages in this book. Not only are there these beautiful crafts for us to try, but just as many good recipes. A definate and all around great buy!!"
4,I can finally do it!!!,"After searching for the past seveal years to find a Christmas project, I have finally found a source that can help me do just that. Martha Stewart's ""Parties and Projects for the Holidays"" includes so many unique and exciting holiday crafts and recipes. The book also does an excellent job of illustrating the directions for almost each and every craft, which comes in great use. She did a wonderful job including a section of crafts that are great for children and easy for them to complete. A definate and all around great buy!!!"
4,Another Martha Classic!,"Here's another Martha book for the collection! With all the ideas and beautiful pictures, it's a book that sure to inspire most to creating beautiful tables and decorations for your own spectacular party!"
5,A shift in perspective can be the difference between heaven or hell,"This is a diamond find. At the very least this book should inspire you to write a daily gratitute list ... and begin a record of how blessed your life is. There is always room for improvement, we are not perfect, but it is in being grateful that we are in a mental state to see what else is possible. I believe Nelson Mandela once said that hate has caused alot of problems and solved none of them. If hate only begats hate, only love can heal hate. Both emotions are two sides of the same coin. Start with this daily counting of blessings, and see what more you can be grateful for."
3,Curious,"I'm interest of this book in oreder to write for my english lesson abouta slangs, vulgarity and jargons."
4,Not About Harry,"This book actually focused on the era, not the person.What an era it was! As a society, we returned from our military triumphs to a series of huge adjustments at home. We were victorious but profoundly uneasy of who we were - and who we were to become.To understand the fifties and sixties, you must understand this era."
3,Worth a read,"Though I found a few of the plot elements more than a bit contrived (even for a fiction title), I thought this book was well-written and interesting. I would recommend this title. However, those with a highly technical background might find some of the creative liberties taken a bit hard to swallow."
3,I'd rather eat a fetus,"After listening to Feed us a Fetus for a few years I had to order a new album from Dayglo Abortions. Maybe I am just stuck on the classics I know so well but Two Dog's Fucking isn't as good as the first album. This album does has a lot of cool disgusting lyrics that I love, like Sit on My Face and Bleed. These guys are a couple of sick bastards, I love em."
4,Blue Good as New,"Arrived quickly, in good condition, in time for me to study for my first quiz. Thanks."
4,The Blue Planet Review,This book was delivered in good condition and on time. I did not miss my test day without the book. Thanks to Amazon for shipping it out ASAP! I will recommend this site to friends.
5,I wish I had read it before I went to Barcelona,"This is a delightful book and a joy to read. It's wonderful mix of many aspects of Barcelona (e.g., history, architecture, food, lifestyle) and some nearby places. Makes me want to return to Barcelona very soon. I'll understand it better next time thanks to this book."
2,Kind of expensive.......,"It lives up to its reputation, but I have found Ronsonol to be just as good. If you are into BULK discounts.... A gallon of Coleman lantern fuel (Naptha) is about $8.88 at your local big name retailers in the camping dept. so 12 ounces for about $9 or 128 ounces for $9. I know you cant efficiently fill a lighter with a gallon can, I just refill my Ronsonol bottle."
1,Half empty,Yeah I got my 12oz. can of lighter fluid but it should be marked as 6oz. It came half empty... I don't know how else to put it.
5,great deal,awesome deal for such a huge supply of lighter fluid. should last a lifetime the way i go through it.
1,READ THIS BEFORE BUYING!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This product is WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY too over priced!!!!!!If anyone wants to buy zippo lighter fluid just look for Ronsonol in any hardware store. It is the specific lighter fluid used to fuel a zippo, and only cost about 3 dollars for 5 fl. oz. (or 148 ml)"
5,Large can,"This is a lot of fluid. The can is huge, it may feel empty but it is the lightness of fluid. the fluid will last a very long time. Not disappointed with buy."
4,Lighter fluid,"I don't like how hard it is to get the small spout out if you push it in too far but other than that I got this for 7 dollars, can't complain about that. Amazon shipping took about a week or so and it had a dent but the shipping is not up to the company that sells the fluid. Good low odor fluid."
5,Works great with lighters and hand warmer,"I own several zippo products and it always seems hard to find fluid in Chicago area. I checked amazon and, sure enough, not only do they sell it but it's cheaper than the brink and mortar!"
5,Wow,"Zippos waste a lot of gas, this will keep my zippo fed for a long time it seems. Awesome product and good price."
4,Exactly as it was described,zippo lighter 12oz exactly described although it felt kinda used around 7/8 of it? i dont know if it was used or not but 4 stars
3,"It works, but overpriced","There is a ton of fluid here, and the zippo lighters don't really use much, but compared to other brands of fluid it is a little pricy. I have used fluid found at a local gas station since purchasing this can, it worked just fine."
2,Overpriced,"Ronson makes lighter fluid that works just as well in zippos, and is WAY cheaper. It's at Walmart, so no waiting for it to arrive or paying obscene shipping charges. You're just buying the brand name here."
2,lighter fluid is lighter fluid,nothing special about the fluid but the shipping was VERY slow. ordered on 4.4.10 and it STARTED to ship on 4.9.10 so i recommend buying same product from different seller.
2,It seems to require a small tool to pop open the spout,"It should let me open without any tools. Plus, there are no instructions for opening. The fuel works, of course."
1,Stinks...,"The fluid itself is not as described it does have a heavy oder and is difficult to use and refill you Zippo. the fluid, when burn, has even a heavier odor and will make you light headed and dizzy. i have used many Zippo brand lighter fluid and i must say this is the what you would expect for the price."
3,Tastes awful!,"Gave me horrible gas, that I could ignite with my Zippo into an impressive cone of fire emanating from my stern. AHOY."
5,Lot of Fluid,"Lot of fluid for a cheap price, if you buy a zippo buy the 12oz can, because you will need it! You will get addicted to your lighter and if you buy the 4 oz can you are going to be sad when you run out!"
1,Was indented,Even though a product is made out of metal it came indented and the box was half soaked in the lighter liquid. I don't really know how this could happen because the box was in perfect condition but the can inside was broken. fortunately it is sold by Amazon so I hope to get a new one that is not broken.
5,Good Price!,"This purchase was definitely worth it, this can is huge. I got it for $12 I paid the same price for a 4 oz. once."
2,half empty...,"I have been an Amazon happy customer for many years. This was the first time I was not so happy with what I got from Amazon. The zippo lighter 120z is not full when I got it. By shaking it and turning it up and down, it seems only has 2/3 of fluid in it.I don't know it was caused by the manufacturer or the stocking at amazon. But probably won't order it again unless I couldn't find it anywhere else."
5,Zippo Lighter Fluid Review,The Zippo 12 oz. Lighter Fluid that I've ordered was very worth my purchasing. It arrived in perfect condition. The product is very effective (I bought it to fuel my boyfriend's new Zippo lighter and he really enjoys it). I am very satisfied with this purchase.
3,Half full,"It's Zippo lighter fluid, what do you expect? Well I expected a completely FULL bottle!I had read reviews claiming they had gotten a half full bottle but I figured ""What are the chances?""3 stars because if u buy a bottle of any kind of fluid, you expect a new,full bottle. Stealth Rabbit was the seller."
5,"Came on time, nice price. It's pretty darn big too.","The cap is childproof. Came safely packaged, and again it's pretty good. Use it right, and it'll last you a long time."
4,"works good, flame backtracks stream...","this works as it should, especially for zippo lighters. the fluid dries within 2 weeks of non usage in my stadndard zippo brand lighter so I think it is the zippo not this fluid.using this to light fires is unsafe because THE FLAME GOES BACK UP THE STREAM.unlike charcoal fluid, when you poor this on a flame, the fire will go back up the stream to the container, which is unsafe and I don't recommend using this for that purpose."
4,Works well enough,"It burns, as lighter fluid should. It's reliable, lights, and is fairly clean. I guess the only thing to get used to is the odor. It smells very kerosene like when lit, also leaves a bit of a tiny smoke when you light a Zippo. But it's made by Zippo for Zippo, so might as well go with it."
2,Lighter Fluid,"The product is good works perfectly, but i got half the fluid. When i started to pour it i realized there was only half of the fluid which was dissapointing and not what i expected."
3,It is not full,"I don't know why it is not full of fluid, when I shake it, I feel it is like 3/4 full.And it seems has opend by someone."
1,Disappointed,"returned this item. Very cheap looking, Got a great ring at another online store. Ths ring was lightweight and thin."
