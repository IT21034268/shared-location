4,contrary to some reviews I have read,"I found this machine to fit my needs and work well.This is the only ink jet fax with an answering machine built in I could find since HP took the answering machine function off of thier's. It was straight forward to set up and get going and easy to use. My only complaint, and this is true for several printers as well is that it will not run without the color cartridges installed,I would use just black if I could rather than filling all of them."
3,BROTHER INTELLIFAX 1960C:,"I, BOUGHT THIS AT CHRISTMAS TIME: I'VE HAD GOOD LUCK, BEFORE MY BLACK COLOR INK ("" STOPPED WORKING?"")...I'M, TRYING TO GET IT REPAIRED, FOR MONTHS ! ANYONE OUT THERE KNOWS A REPAIRS ? CAN'T, SEND IT BACK!"
1,If Could Give the No Stars Rating it Deserves I Would,This machine has been nothing but trouble since I bought it from Amazon in February. To Brothers credit they are now arranging a no charge repair at a local service company.There are many more attractive units on the market and I recommend bypassing this one.I have a Brother MFC unit at my summer home and it works flawlessly and that's the reason I bought this unit. I should have returned it for credit soon after I opened the box as it had problems from the start.
1,Brother what a major disappointment,"I bought this machine to replace a former Brother telephone answering machine /fax. I even spent more money than the usual fax machine in order to have the ansering machine feature. However the new machine can not be set to take incoming faxes AND receive voice messages if you have voice messaging on your phone service. AND you cannot even leave it plugged in to receive faxes without disrupting your (AT&T;)voice mail service. So we have to plug it in to receive faxes. WHich means we leave it unplugged most of the time, and so cannot even use the telephone feature.My Prior Brother handled this fine: it took messages if you were not on the phone, and sent messages to AT&T; if you were on the phone. I really liked the convenience of hearing the incoming messages before I picked up the phone.Customer service was not helpful and said I would have to pay for a distinctive phone ring and an extra incoming number."
2,Frustrating maching,"I like the features: cordless phone, ans. machine, printer, fax machine, not overly large. However, I have threatened so many time to chuck it in the trash (first have to replace it). Paper jams are frequent, It's extremely difficult to extract a paper jam from the innards of the machine. I rarely print with color, but the machine frequently reports near empty color cartridges. I must replace all the color cartridges, even it I only want to print black -- it just won't print black without the costly replacement of dried up color cartridges (and I guess they dry up in a matter of just a couple months)! It is very temperamental. Often cuts off phone messages while being recorded. Trouble shooting is a bad joke. I definitely would not purchase another!!!!!"
2,Not a good choice,"Printer line does not come with the package. The voice of the phone is low and unclear, unable to scan photo id, printing speed is slow."
1,Poor performance,I was never able to get the machine to copy or print. I was not able to send or receive faxes. I returned it.
2,Got Burned,"To get satisfaction for being sold a defective refurbished machine I have to tote it to factory rep twenty miles away at my expense or ship it to same at great expense. Vendor only sells. This model is a disaster. Paper tray is clunky. Fax/copy insert mechanism often grabs paper unevenly or grabs too many sheets even when paper is pristine. Fax mode has sent a fax twice of its own accord which caused problems with the businesses I was dealing with. Copy is always too light regardless of setting. IOW, do not buy a low end refurbished machine."
2,Meh,"Well this book was recommended to me from someone I know. I found the idea to be intriguing, but the character of Devlin was flawed, and not in a good way. I prefer characters in books who are flawed yet it is very rare to find one. I found that Devlin was easily predictable, as well as the plot. I also found the writing to be very bland and boring, I found myself at times taking a paragraph or two and rewriting them with more passion, and colorful word choices. As others have said this book is a simple read, if you do not want anything complex, if you want a predictable story line with not a whole lot of character development then this one would do well for you. Myself I will not be rushing to the store to buy the next book, though because the story had, or has some small faint shimmer of potential I might buy it in few years."
3,A bit flat...,"Possibly my expectactions were inappropriate, from the cover blurb I expect the hero to be a man suicidal with survivor's guilt who would be recklessly successful in his search for an honorable way to throw his life away. I was hoping for some deep soul searching and psychological insight.Instead I got a basic story about someone becoming a hero against long odds because of great internal resourcfulness. Nothing wrong with that, it's often done, but it's often done. So it seems a little flat. There's some interesting insight into the nature of free will and psychology courtesy of the geas, but that was the main differentness of this book.To me it was just same old-same old."
5,Excellent Beginning!,"Patricia Bray has managed to start up a convincing and well written Fantasy world based not off amazing magics, nor off the defeat of some uber ""dark god,"" but off characters and their interactions with their world. Devlin Stonehand is a very well written character and all of the other minor characters from Stephen and Captain Drakken are as equally well formed... The story doesn't drag and simply proceeds onwards in a concise and tight manner.Well done!"
3,Forgettable,"The plot was overall rather nice, nothing special about it. What I liked the least though, was the Devlin himself. He seemed too snob and not nice enough to the few friends he has to earn my respect. Just after a few pages he started getting on my nerves. Other than that, it's a good book and I'll probably read the next one if it falls under my fingers."
1,Text to speech disabled,"I have enjoyed Patricia Bray's other works and have read 2 of her book on my kindle. However, she has now chosen to use publishers who do not allow text to speech.SHAME ON THE PUBLISHERS FOR HAMPERING THIS BOOK.I will not be buying any more of Ms. Bray's books unless text to speech is enabled."
2,Low contrast ratio,"Realized too late that this monitor has a much lower contrast ratio than the f2105. You might not notice the difference if you hadn't already seen the f2105, but it's obvious that the w22 is not in the same league as the f2105. The colors are washed out, and the sharpness suffers, even though the resolution is supposed to be the same.Odd how HP is regressing in their package deals...six months ago I bought a similar package with the f2105, and assumed that six months later, if anything, I'd get a better monitor. Wrong.Live and learn."
4,I like it.,"The red gun completely died in my old-fashioned CRT about a week and a half before Christmas. Because of Christmas, I found it very difficult to find anything wide screen in local stores over 19"" in stock with a decent resolution. Being pleased with a smaller HP monitor I bought for my parents last year, I bought this one directly from HP without seeing it in person. I was disappointed at first. I switched from VGA to DVI (there wasn't a dvi cable in the box, I had to steal one from work). It was a little better but still disappointing. My video card couldn't be set to display the optimum resolution that HP recommends for this monitor. I ran Microsoft Windows Update and found a monitor driver that allowed my old Nvidia video card to display the optimum resolution -- it improved greatly and am now pleased that I didn't throw my money away. Unforunately I can't compare it with the f2105 or any other similar sized monitor at this price point so I am limiting my review to 4 stars."
4,Good but not like my iMac,"I like this monitor but it seems a little washed out compared to my 20"" iMac, which has richer, brighter colors. I have tried to optimize it and think it's at its peak. But it's still not as good as I was hoping for."
5,An excellent applied reference on The Natural Step,"The authors provide a real service with this book. So far much of the published work on The Natural Step framework has remained conceptual, without a lot of practical examples of the model in practice. The case examples of IKEA, Collins Pine, and Interface provide valuable references for organizational managers and consultants who are working to build more sustainable organizations. I highly recommend this book."
5,Companies on the right road.,Exceptional book describing the background of the Natural Step process but more importantly provides evidence that companies who embrace sustainabilty in every aspect will be well rewarded for their efforts. Well done with loads of detail.
3,Quite informative and not technical,"This DVD leads us through time to examine the strength of the Earth¡s magnetic field through various perspectives, from potteries to volcano rocks. It also briefly describes the consequences of Earth without the protection of the magnetic field, how Earth generates the magnetic field, and when the next reversal of magnetic field occurs.I find that the information on the DVD is not detailed enough. However, the PBS website (http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/magnetic/) gives me a better understanding of the Earth¡s magnetic field."
5,Great supplement for earth sciences study,"We watched this video as part of an earth sciences study with my girls (9 years old, 12 years old). I was hoping it would be accessible and not overly technical ... and it is! The girls (and their parents) enjoyed and learned from this episode just fine. Like someone else mentioned, I was happy to hear that it wasn't a huge doomsday, magnetic field reversal scare video. Just a nice overview perfect for a supplement or review to a study of our magnetosphere."
5,Super NOVA production!,"As usual with NOVA, it EXPLAINS things like no other programs do - other programs (Discovery/History) bring UP a lot of topics, but they lack EXPLANATION and topic focus so that you don't understand the topic properly - they cover a lot but don't explain much. NOVA programs leave you filled with information, understanding and mystery - ""Magnetic Storm"" is typical. The Earth's magnetic field is weakening and explains how it does this, how many times in the past, what it means when the fields switch, etc., etc. The story is complete. It's told by many scientists - narrator is just there to tie things together. This is a very good production. Great topic focus."
2,You probably want the other version of this song,"There are two Mad World singles, a red one and a blue one. Get the later:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000X1K4M"
2,Never Received,I ordered this CD more then a month ago I stil have not received it. When I emailed to complained they gave me a tracking number. I don't want a tracking number I want my CD. They said that they have sent me another one but I'm at the point where I just don't care anymore. They can keep the CD the money everything. I will never buy from these people again.
2,Not a typical Benoit recording,"This recording, though not typical David Benoit, demonstrates David Benoit's talents. Nevertheless, I was disappointed. My first disappointment came when I noticed that I'd purchased a Not-For-Resale promo CD. Next, the recordings aren't that catchy. Still, this piece may be one of those that I have to let grow on me. It has two mini-orchestral works that are multi-segment pieces, one or both of an oriental theme. The fact that I don't really remember shows that I just don't care for the work, it just doesn't inspire. The only nice work is a testimony to the fallen at Ground Zero, New York where the Twin Towers once stood before 9/11/2001. It's very touching.If you want to risk a few bucks on a 50s sounding orchestral work, buy it. Its somewhat interesting. It is definitely NOT smooth jazz. But it just never caught me by surprise."
4,Whimsical Wonderment!,"I've always loved David Benoit's orchestral backdrop to his playing and this treads new ground, in that the majority of the CD is orchestrally driven, and it works well. He's a talented and clearly skilled conductor also and sets various scenes, in a well considered musical form, in conceptual fashion, as described in the liner notes.Having said that, not all of the orchestral material flows in a way that I appreciated or indeed enjoyed as much as I was hoping. The first part of the CD, in particular the 9/11 tribute song, is very appealing though, and remains for me, the highlight.A must purchase for all die-hard Benoit fans."
1,Disappointed,"I was able to copy files to a data DVD once, now it won't work. I was able to copy a Music cd, but was never able to make a DVD. Tryed to work with the company, but was unable to get an answer that worked except the last comment, delete all burn software, so I deleted theirs, the one that came with the Sony laptop does work, but takes 2 hours. Perhaps it is my newer laptop that is the problem, I will never know. A thumbs down to Pinnacle."
3,heavy,It took me a month to read this book. Very deep and realistic and depressing. The ending seemed very artificial.
1,Definitely NOT for kids!!,"I remember reading this book in college - it was wonderful!! So, I decided to get it for my nine year old daughter. I remembered the basic plot, but forgot that there are very mature topics in this book. In one instance, it describes a rape in some detail, which might traumatize young readers. PLEASE do not buy this for young children or even young teens!! This is much more suitable for high school students and older."
5,Christy: An Enjoyable Read,"Christy is a heart-warming story of a 19-year old girl who yearns to find fulfillment in life. The book covers approximately a one-year period beginning with Christy leaving her comfortable life for the incredibly challenging task of teaching at a mission school in the Tennessee mountains. While there is romance, I see it more as a (spiritual) coming-of-age book where the events and people lead Christy to find meaning in life and to claim her Christian faith as her own. The book is very well written with interesting characters and thought-provoking situations. I found it hard to put down and highly recommend it!"
2,Too many coincidences.,"Sorry, but the glut of coincidences and melodramatic writing was just too much. I'm going back to my nonfiction now."
5,what I think:),I think its a well writen story of a woman who because she choose to follow the Lord and his will for her led a extrodenairy life and learned the true reason she came and true love
5,"Christy is such a great book, I couldn't put it down.","The characters struggle with real problems that many people have, but no one will talk about. ""Christy"" takes you into the life of a young girl struggling, but not afraid to voice her hardships and trials. She works her way through failure, hope, love, search for acceptance, and journeys through the paths of life that eventually lead her to her place in the world."
5,My Favorite Book,Christy is my favorite book of all time. It's one of those books you can read over and over again and never get board. It's wonderful.
4,this book was like really cool.,I think that this book was just like totally awsome and i reccomend that other people read it.
4,Seed on Soil,"It's a true story on a city girl who's tired of sitting inChurch every Sunday and wanted to do something out of herlive.High above the city dwellers, Christy found the real meaningof love in teaching the mountain kids. And because of love,the highlanders were changed -- for good."
5,My favorite,This is not much and I'm only 12 years old butI must say that this is the most wonderfulbook that I have ever read. So inspiring!
5,"was it a mystery, or am i dumb?","i may be totally stupid, but whenever i read this book it drives me insane because it doesn't say WHO she ends up marrying. Am i just missing it, or is it the greatest secret of all time? help! Anyway, David is awesome (he is sooooo cute in the tv series! my sister and i have ""fallen in love"" with Randal Batinkoff) Christy is an intriuging character, and I really could ""see"" through her eyes the way C. Marshall wrote it. check out ""Julie"" by the same author, it's really good!"
4,Moving and poignant book,I really enjoyed this book. I also enjoyed the fact that many of the events in the book are in the series released on DVD. I would have preferred if certain subjects had not been discussed in this book so that it would be more appropriate for younger ages. Other than that it was a really enjoyable read.
4,Christmas is covered,Well presented book that does most of it's work through the very good large format photographs that illustrate the various concepts included. Loose 1 star because the last inclusions appear to around the year 2000.
4,Very Appropriate For Those Special Moments,"There are certain times when you won't to creat an intimate sensual atmosphere. Exile On Main Street and Abbey Road are two great master recordings, but each of these classics can not match Barry White for a soothing sensual moment when a man just wants to be close to a special lady. Barry's soft rap and soothing vocals along with a steady instrumental backing just sets a relaxed atmosphere. The songs do not vary too much in tone and its all about making love and giving love and yearning for love. Normally I like variety in my music. However, this style is so on the money that the limited variety that exists here certainly fits my bill......especially when love is in the air!"
5,Good Loving,"This is an absolute essential album to own if you are in love. It has a reputation of being the classic make-out record of all-time, and classify it as that is just not fair -- it is much more than a cheap way to get the vibe going. It is an excellent, soul-making album of the finest order. Listen to it with someone you love, and share the greatness of the cool sounds of Barry White."
4,one of the best albums for getting you in the mood.,one of the best albums in the world to get you the mood for dancing and romancing.He is truly the master of love.
2,A Final Disappointment,"You all aren't going to be happy with me (press the unhelpful button all you like), but I just couldn't enjoy this album much beyond a couple of listens. Maybe it's me -- I keep buying Wainwright expecting to see him re-capture the magic he had on albums like Album III and Unrequited. You can't get better than ""Dead Skunk"" or ""Red Guitar"" or ""New Paint"" or ""Mr. Guilty"". Now it's like he tries too hard. The music is passable, but the lyrics -- though sometimes inspired -- too often seem forced. You see the rhymes coming from a mile away. This from the guy who came up with a gem like ""You can feel it in your olfactory""? And it's the self-absorption apparent in all his songs that give you clues to all the failed relationships he has demoaned throughout his career. Anyway, that is my humble opinion."
5,Move Over Paul...,"I used to be of the opinion that Paul Simon is the best poet of my (increasingly aged) generation. Loudon Wainwright's perceptive, literate, and poignant CD, ""Last Man On Earth,"" has disabused me of that notion. And I'm not even counting the quality of the music, singing and production -- all of which are top drawer. Music and lyrics that can simultaneously bring a tear to your eye and a smile to your face is true art. Virtually every cut of this very special collection achieves that end. And the songs here are as noteworthy for their brevity as they are for their beauty. Wainwright's music doesn't wallow in verbose pretention or self indulgence. He says what he has to say with precision and eloquence -- and he doesn't take all day to do it.I pride myself on being a contrarian, but this time I'm just another sheep in the flock. I loved this CD -- and my bet is you will too."
2,Grat album,I listened to the album and am again pleased with my purchase. Another good solid album from a folk song master.
4,A man who sings what he feels,"I heard of Loudon Wainwright III and his new album on a talk show on National public radio. His songs really hit the spot of a man into his 50's and what he is going through. Stark, sad, and funny at times this album portrays life as it is without all the fluff. Go buy it and support Loudon and his small record company that produced it."
3,Everett TItcomb not on this CD,"I bought this CD specifically because it came up in a search for the composer, Everett Titcomb. I scanned through the album previews to find out which of his pieces was on the CD. However, the previews don't have the composers listed with them, so I took it on faith that a Titcomb arrangement was among them. That is wrong. He is not on this CD. It's a good CD, but if you happen to be searching for Titcomb, he ain't here, so don't buy it for that reason."
1,Definately not art.,"The attractive appealing young woman on the cover is the only thing attractive and appealing about this DVD. The DVD consists of a group of amateurish, crudely done clips that barely qualify as pornography."
1,some misleading,"There is a sort of misleading between the face picture and the content of the DVD. The face picture is a pretty young lady and looks like a fine art. However, the main episodes of the DVD do not follow the taste of the face picture. I will say, they look ugly except the first episode that is posted in the face picture. However, if you simply need a documentary, then go ahead and get it."
3,A nice kitchen LCD w/DVD Player,Audiovox VE727 Ultra Slim 7-Inch LCD Drop Down TV with Built-in Slot Load DVD PlayerA nice LCD TV w/DVD Player for the Kitchen although you will need a digital to analog converter when viewing over the air TV Channels in Feb of 09. I thought the Audiovox TV was digital ready since any set manufactured after Mar 08 was supposed to have this capability. The DVD quit working after 1 week and the set was returned to the manufacturer under an RMA for repair and return. The DVD player was repaired and has worked ever since.
1,Won't Hold Charge,"The Gizmo is a great idea, but mine doesn't hold a charge long enough to make it useful.I've only used it to mix meal substitute powders into milk, so I haven't asked much from the Gizmo.A 4-hour charge gives 10 seconds of high speed power, then it will contine on slow -- which isn't much more effective than mixing with a spoon!I charged it all weekend and was only able to mix for about 30 seconds.I don't understand the reviewers who said theirs stayed charged for a long, long time. Did I and and another complaining reviewer get lemon Gizmos?Final Answer: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GIZMO!"
2,Great for Drinks.... that's about it,"Not a happy camper right now.... I just finished whipping a batch of body butter - By Hand - with my Gizmo-with-the-dead-battery. I'd like to meet the rocket scientist who designed the Gizmo to NOT work while plugged in. Major design flaw! I purchased this thing with the intention of using it for soap making. It doesn't have the oompf to handle body butter, I'm not even trying it on a batch of soap. I have been unsuccessful beating eggs with it - the yolks dance around the beater until finally I smash them with a fork. The one beater design flings liquids over the sides of bowls so be sure to use extra-deep bowls. Does a grrreat job mixing drinks. Just make sure the glass is tall enough to contain the liquid and don't add anything too thick. Highly recommend this for traveling protein shake junkies. Otherwise, it's fun to play with but doesn't stand up to real kitchen use."
5,Excellent hand mixer,Very nice to make shakes or a quick cake without the hassle of cleaning up a regular mixer.
1,"Handy Little Mixer but, Short Battery Life","I bought this for my wife because the NiCad battery on her old one had quit holding a charge. The battery is the only thing wrong with these handy little mixers. I don't understand why any company still puts NiCad batteries in their products. Eventually they all develope a memory and then won't charge back to full capacity. As for the mixer it's great. It's not quite as efficient as two beater models but then it makes up for that in portability. My wife simply wouldn't be without one. The only reason I don't give Gizmo five stars is the battery. I purchased this from Amazon and as usual they provide the best service and prices of anyone. I give Amazon five stars every time.UPDATE: One year later, the batteries are weakening on this one too and just charge enough to barely make the mixer turn. I don't recommend this mixer unless you want to replace it every year."
2,Not remotely a replacement for the older version corless mixer.,"I had the earlier version of the mixer for many years and felt bad when it finally died. Tried to get a new battery to no avail so purchased the Gizmo as a replacement. It's not even a close second! Doesn't hold a charge and is one of the wimpiest pieces of kitchen equipment I've ever used. (And I've been cooking for a long, long time.) It's also a major struggle just to get the mixer out of the holder. Would definitely NOT recommend it to anyone. Black & Decker should be ashamed to put their name on a product as bad as this one."
3,good,It's a good equipment but the slow speed it's too slow and the fast it's too fast then when you use for some time the batteries (in the handle grip) set too hot
4,Like this but liked the previous version better,I like the Gizmo portable mixer but was disappointed by the changes from the last version which we had for years. I saved the one attachment from the last one that had 4 attachments instead of 3 and it works alright on this but would be handier if it had a slot to attach to the mixer stand. I also liked just being able to pull the mixer off the stand and put it back without having to plug the cord in and take it out every time I used it. It is only suitable for light mixing not for heavy mixing.It was very difficult to find this product. I had to google it to find it. I couldn't find it on the Black & Decker site.
1,The Gizmo would not hold a charge from the day I got it (as gift),"As many reviews have stated, this ""gizmo"" has some serious problems - mainly many will not hold a charge. I got mine as a gift so did not take it back to the store (should have). Instead I finally spent the money for a new battery thinking the original battery was faulty. Well, the new battery would not hold a charge either! Now it is headed for the trash."
5,The Gizmo is better than what it replaced.,"The Gizmo is better than the old Black & Decker cordless mixer it replaced. With the Gizmo you are able to leave the charging line unpluged when you replace it in it's holder. This let's you run the battery most of the way down before recharging, thus keeping the battery from developing low charge memory. I do wish they had put in cord cut-outs on the ends. You can overcome this by eather making your own with a small file, or by just snugging down the mounting screws whike storing the excess cord behind the mounting holder."
1,waste of time and money,"The item is bulkier than it looks, does not work, and brings the name Black and Decker to a new low. I wasted my time looking for the item, and waiting for it to arrive. Then, it does not work."
2,get a better product,"I have purchased the Gizmo mixer twice and have been disappointed both times. I am looking for a suitable replacement and will purchase it when I am satisfied, I am receiving value for the hard earned money that I spend."
1,Don't bother,Battery died after less than a year. Old Handy Mixer lasted for years. Not much power when it was new. Now its just a paper weight.
1,"Neat Mixer, But battery goes kaput in less than 1 year","Loved the mixer. It is neat, compact, and worked well on small to medium tasks. However, in less than one year, it would no longer hold a charge. Zip, no buzz, no purr, nothing. It could not even be charged to work for 1 second. Sorry, B&W, but you need to work on better quality rechargeable batteries for this baby."
5,Great for certain applications,"It's not all that powerful, but I use it to mix my diet drinks--only one thing, the beater, to wash; and it travels extremely well; it also doesn't put too much air in the diet drink--a problem w/stronger blender. I also use it to beat an egg for an omelet or scrambled eggs.I really like it. I've bought an extra one for work, and given one to a friend who went on the same diet."
4,Not as slick as previous version but works well.,"As the other reviewer stated, the corded charging system is a step back but other than that it works well. I mounted mine on the back wall under the upper kitchen cabinets and pinned the cord toward the front under the cabinet. This way if the cord isn't plugged in it hangs down in clear view as a reminder, when plugged in it has just enough length to reach the mixer so you can barely see it."
1,No power at all,"My dear hubby bought this for me last year for Christmas and since I had a great hand mixer, I did not use it until a few days ago, when my old mixer burned up. Well, first, it is designed to not work while it is charging, so you have to wait once you lose the charge for it to charge up completely again before finishing what you started. I tried to beat egg whites today and when I went to add sugar to them, the battery started dying, or the mix (of egg whites and sugar) was too thick, I am not sure which. I barely finished and then just decided to mix everything else by hand. I am quite dissappointed with this machine and am hoping for a full blown stand mixer this Christmas!"
4,"Handy, but not as handy","Replaced a 10+ year old B&D; Handi Mixer.A very convenient kitchen tool, but the old model did not require you to plug in and disconnect to use. It automatically snapped into the recharging base.I would still highly recommend.On line order was priced right and arrived quickly. I could not find this item in stores."
5,Awesome mixer!,"I bought this mixer to replace an old one I had. I have used this to make cakes, pies, soups, ANYTHING! I love this mixer because it's small and compact and has no cord. I don't have room for a big KitchenAid mixer, and the cord on my old hand mixer always ended up in what I was mixing (and ended up with food all over, and all over me). I highly recommend this mixer, it's awesome!"
1,Attachments rust out.,"This is a good unit, it has 2 speeds, but you only use the fast one. I like how it sits on it's end when you are in between mixing, but all of the attachments rusted out after a few mos & I wash/dry them the same night. Very poor metal for the gizmo."
3,The Gizmo Mixer,"Good mixer for the ""lighter mixing"" chores. Not for mixing through tough cake batter. Engine not strong enough for those heavy mixing jobs."
3,All the attachments RUSTED out,"I like my Gizmo. My fav part is after I mix something I can sit it on it's flat part. And the attachment can drip over the bowl or measuring cup while I get something, like more ingredients. I do think the whisk is almost too unwieldy for the power & size of the mixer. I don't like it that I've had it about a year and ALL of the attachment are rusted & I can't get it off. It has 2 speeds, I never use the slow. I use it mostly for making salad dressing & little things. 13.52 still was an xlnt buy."
3,I liked the prior design better................,"It works very well and I wouldn't be without one in my kitchen, but I REALLY liked the prior design better that recharged the mixer simply by putting it back in the cradle rather than fooling with a plug-in cord."
5,Love it!,"Convenient, easy to use, takes up no storage space. I'm sure we'll wear this one out as we did the previous B&D mixer."
5,Gift,"Black & Decker GM200 Gizmo Mixer, White. Was purchased as a requested gift and was greatly appreciated. Thank you."
1,Black and Decker Gizmo,"Please don't waste your money!! This mixer will not mix a protein drink or powdered milk, after 3 minutes and still lots of clumps I gave up. It will, however, mix sugar into hot tea but a spoon would be more practical."
5,This little gizmo cordless hand mixer is dandy.,"I just ordered two in case they stop making it. I owned the other model (not gizmo) and had 3 of them---gave them for gifts too. It is just a dandy little mixer for small jobs- whips heavy cream in a minute and dips and sauces. I love it--so handy and at fingertips. It is not intended to replace a stand mixer--but is great on icings and puddings and gingerbread and cornbread, etc. You simply cannot find it in a retail store or on line at B&D either. So, always go to Amazon when in doubt."
1,DOESN'T WORK,I had the earlier version of the mixer for many years and felt bad when it finally died. Tried to get a new battery to no avail so purchased the Gizmo as a replacement. It's not even a close second! Doesn't hold a charge and is one of the wimpiest pieces of kitchen equipment I've ever used. It's also a major struggle just to get the mixer out of the holder. Would definitely NOT recommend it to anyone. Black & Decker should be ashamed to put their name on a product as bad as this one. I hope Black and Decker will honor it's 1 year warranty!!
5,Cordless Hand Mixer Replacement,"We've had a B&D; Cordless Hand Mixer in our kitchen for over 10 years. It served us well for many applications until recently when the NiCad batteries finally gave out. A search of popular chain stores (K-Mart, Sears, Walmart) turned up no suitable replacement.Searching Amazon.com revealed the B&D; Gizmo which we ordered immediately. Upon receiving it we found that the holder which stores it matched the mounting screw locations of the previous mixer perfectly. The plug in charging cord, as opposed to the charging contacts in the previous holder, is a great improvement. There was no charging indicator light on the previous model to assure a good connection.The Gizmo performs as well as, if not better, then our ""old friend."" We are very pleased that B&D; continued to make this vital kitchen appliance and Amazon.com listed it for sale. Both should keep up the good work."
1,Not what I expected,"I own an old Black and Decker truly cordless mixer that is now worn out so I ordered a B and D ""Gizmo"". I'm disappointed. It is not the same. This Gizmo is designed to be unplugged when it used and manually plugged in again after use. That is an inconvenience. The older model's dock was designed to be energized so that you did not have to plug and unplug the mixer itself---just remove it from the dock and put it back in after use. The Gizmo is also difficult to remove from its holder(or dock)"
1,charging time is too long,I don't understand the logic of this product.It requires more than 10 hours to charge. and it cannot be used while charging. and the battery loses its charge in a week. I end up having an almost depleted battery EVERY TIME!It is a stupid design.
4,"Handy, but the ""only show in town""","I bought this to replace one which I had for only a year before the battery died. I did find it handy enough to replace despite the short life of the battery, so I must have liked it. I searched for one by another manufacturer but it seems when it comes to battery powered hand mixers, B&D is the only show in town."
2,Not as good as the original,"I was disappointed in this version of the Gizmo. I had the original and loved it. My old one, you just put into the base and it automatically got charged. This new Gizmo needs to have the power cord connected to it manually before placing it in the base. Also, the power doesn't seem as strong as the older one. It took a lot longer to scramble eggs. I really miss my old Gizmo!"
2,All attachments rusted out,"I like my Gizmo. My fav part is after I mix something I can sit it on it's flat part. And the attachment can drip over the bowl or measuring cup while I get something, like more ingredients. I do think the whisk is almost too unwieldy for the power & size of the mixer. I don't like it that I've had it about a year and ALL of the attachment are rusted & I can't get it off. It has 2 speeds, I never use the slow. I use it mostly for making salad dressing & little things. 13.52 still was an xlnt buy."
2,B&D GIXMO MIXER,This is an excellent product with one flaw - the blender attachment cracks in the dishwasher. One has to hand wash it. This is not explained in the instructions.My biggest complaint is the cost of the product. I bought the same product at Wal Mart three years ago for under $20. The cost this time was over $45. Why the extreme price jump? Inflation was not 225% over the past three years. The reason for my giving only a two star rating was the price gouding.I realize that Amazon dealt with a third party for sale and handling of this product. You might want to quiz this company about its pricing policies and then take appropriate action.
5,great,perfect fit and nice construction. I even ordered another for my other car and would not hesitate to buy again
3,Pretty Good,"This book is pretty good.There are no answers to the homework problems, so it is hard to tell if you have mastered the concepts when used as self-study.It would be nice if it went into a little more depth in places.While it shows the far-field spot patterns (point-spread functions), it doesn't describe the near-field phase can lead to such PSF's even for on-axis objects."
1,Buyers Beware,"I only had the opportunity to scan the texbook to extract technical info to understand a training manual written by Donald O'Shea for Photon Inc. (who makes the BeamScan machine). The manual is an absolute disaster: numerous diagrams are wrong; some instructions are incomplete; theory is given in hard-to-follow style. I got the training manual for free and did not have enough courage to buy O'Shea's textbook (at $130), i.e., if a training manual is that bad, the textbook must be in similar shape. I expected better from a PhD professor at Georgia Tech."
2,will do,Needed cheap camra for boy to take to camp outs. Takes blurry pictures. Pain in the neck to down load.But serves the perpouse
1,Melted,"I ordered the Milka Alpine Milk Chocolate and the Creme chocolate, but was very disappointed when I got my package. The chocolate was completely melted and packged VERY poorly. There was no ice pack in the box at all to help keep the items from melting. I ordered chocolate from other companies on Amazon and all their chocolate arrived in excellent condition, but this was horrible. I'm sure the chocolate will taste great once it reforms its melted self though! Just watch when you order from Euro Food Mart cause you might get melted products too or you might have to additionally pay for an ice pack to be added to your order."
5,avant pop not alt.country,"YFM falls into many categories - most noteably the avant pop world. Don't let the country twang fool you, there's more than beats the ear to this band. Beautiful, quirky and thoroughly refreshing lyrics - laced with subtle melodies and samples make this a great summer ""open the screen door honey, let's sit out on the porch"" type record. i saw 'em live - and they can rock too! check out the richie valens cover of ""donna"" and their ""excercise"" and ""your favorite music."" quite dynamic. i just wish they'd record the version of Sonic Youth's ""schizophrenia"" they do. wow."
5,Best of 2000,"What can I say. The last time I was so love in with a cd was when Galaxie 500 released On Fire. I takes awhile to warm up to, but its worth the effort and is of course more subdued. Best tracks: Dairy Queen, Loneliness Finds Her Own Way and Messiah Complex Blues. Just Great. My favorite cd of 2000."
4,Revenge of the Nerd,"Eef Barzelay's voice is a 98 pound weakling of an instrument, a tuneless mewling whine that sounds like he's auditioning for a lead role in ""Revenge of the Nerds VI."" And yet, that voice works perfectly in the context of Clem Snide, a band that deals exclusively in morose acoustic shambling that often seems as if they're following the beat of a metronome with a dying battery. Everything here crawls at the same dirge-like pace. The exceptions are ""I Love The Unknown"" and ""Messiah Complex Blues,"" both of which manage to flex some pecs while delivering a decent tune. Even during those two comparatively upbeat endeavors, however, Barzelay's voice remains front and center, bleating out wiseass lyrics (that settle for clever more often than smart) with absolutely no deviation in tone. So it's all for Eef and Eef for some - his voice is definitely not for everyone. But if you're the type who always cheers for the underdog, then make sure to give ""Your Favorite Music"" a fair chance."
1,Vastly Overrated,This is among the most boring records I've ever heard. Vapid tuneless doodlings here pass for wry deadpan commentary. Sonic quality of a Violent Femmes 45 played back at 33-1/3. Gets my vote for most overrated band of the 00's.
3,Reba finally scores a #1,"This collection contains Reba's very first #1 hit, ""Can't Even Get the Blues."" Other highlights include ""I'm Not that Lonely Yet,"" ""Everything I'll Ever Own,"" and ""What Do You Know About Heartache."" For the most part, this is a good album, and actually one of the best of Reba's early works. It shows her growth and experience in the studio."
4,"5 Great, 2 Good, and 3 Mediocre Songs","I was really crazy about the album track, ""Everything I'll Ever Own"" when this came out and the two waltz singles (""First Time I've Thought About Leaving"" and ""I'm Not That Lonely Yet."" ""I'd Say You"" and ""What Do You Know About Heartache"" grew on me and I really like them now, but I've grown less fond of ""Can't Even Get the Blues"" over the years, (though I really like the songwriters Rick and Janis Carnes own country records from this period). ""Whoever's Watchin'"" teeters in that ground between bluegrass and Southern rock that was gaining ground in the early 80s, and while it's fun for a fast polka, it's not listening music for me (and I'm too old and fat to dance that fast anymore)."
1,More Junk for Billiard Ball Sized Noses,"It's not just that the blade is so low in the trimmer (which it is), it's that the trimmer is short, fat and stocky. It's huge. Who is this target market with nostrils the size of a billiard ball that this thing is supposed to fit up? Only an idiot would design such a model. Whoever is getting paid in product testing needs to be fired."
4,Learning more about the world,"Susan Kearney really knows how to build a world. Learning more about the different kinds of aliens and societies she can come up with is always intriguing. And this one is no exception. The only thing I didn't care for (and thus, why I took 1 star off), is the sections with Kirek (a super genius and the possible key to saving the future) as a sexual slave. Slavery is just hard to take, even for the sake of a story.But otherwise, the story and the characters continue to feel fresh and interesting."
2,Fell for it again dammit!,"Every time Kearney comes out with a new one I read the synopsis and it looks good. Unfortunately there are no laws against bad authors taking good ideas. If Kearney were a true book lover she would give her ideas to someone who could do them justice. I mean my god! Every single one of her books is disappointment after disappointment. You'd think that even if she couldn't manage to come through with the story she would at least put some spark into the romance. I swear she uses the same sex scene in every book. And its not even a good one! Spanking, and 'tavis's' and submission as if she's following a manual. She manages to remove any sexyness (not a word I know) from the sex scenes! How the hell did she get published? It's just wrong! I know the story looks good, but if you read them you will only be infuriated that an author like this got her hands on a plot with such potential."
5,"PROTECTED BY "" DACHSHUND HOME SECURITY SYSTEM "" PARKING SIGN DOG",PERFECT as described. Buy one for the front door and one for the back door!
5,It's about time,"Shred has been dead since day one. Wether it's Malmsteen or Vai (who was good when Zappa told him what to do) or... it's been nothing but amazing guitar licks over bad, bad rythm sections. But didn't we all hope that one day those techniques would be used to a more interesting effect? Shawn Lane's work with Hellborg did it, Buckethead did it, and now... Mattias IA Eklundh, killer player. but most importantly he has great taste. This disc is very Zappa inspired and sounds alot like Buckethead, but with tighter compositions and more of a European influence (gypsy scales and what not). Definitely worth picking up, and what a sense of humour. I haven't laughed this much at someones guitar playing (laughed in a good way I mean) since the day's of Danny Gatton. Hellborg has just picked this guy up for some power trio work with Jeff Sipe. I am really looking forward to hearing what they do together."
5,match made in heaven,"you just got to luv this from the Chemicals...teamed up with the Flamming Lips, match made in heaven!! :-) lol... My 5 year daughter rocks along with it, it's been on the Cd player for a few rotations...so she knows the words already, provoking interesting conversations!! It's all good, and the longer Patterson remix is great as well..."
1,did this come from a butt hole? cuz it sounds like...sh*#,I dont know what to say.. this PILE has attachments to the flaming lips.. and that makes me so sad.. they are good but if they even put thier name on anything else like this.. I will quit buying thier stuff eww I heard it a weeks ago.. and it still hurts.. I never knew sound could smell so bad!!
3,Denzel in Period Drama,"In the same way that Errol Flynn played in period dramas, Denzel Washington was now given the opportunity to play in period dramas as a leading character. In 'Devil in a Blue Dress', he did not need to bounce off other big names actors because just seeing him alone in a period drama was enough.The film is set just after the Second World War, and Denzel returns back to his neighbourhood aiming to own his property and develop a lifestyle. Throughout the film, we follow him on his journey to independence, and enjoy the fruits of his labour with him. As all good stories end up, Denzel achieves his goal by the end of the film."
2,average,i was looking foreward to this film but it was just so-so.Denzel Washington who is the best Actor in Hollywood today is rather average in this film.this is however a breakthrough for Don Cheadle.he stole the film from Washington.Jennifer Beals is to me pretty Wooden in this film.not much substance.the Direction was solid.
2,Good directing is wasted by a confusing and boring plot,I saw some good reviews for this movie so I got it on DVD and it was absolutely boring. The plot is too confusing. I wish the same effort was put in to a movie with a decent plot. Denzel Washington put in a good performance which also goes to waste. If you read the book...
2,Seriously Miscast,"I loved the book, so I rushed to see this movie when it came out. Walter Mosely is listed as an ""associate producer"" but I wonder who ultimately cast this movie? Denzel is perfect as Easy, Tom Sizemore is perfect as Albright but Don Cheadle was miscast as Mouse. In the book, he's described as light-skinned and handsome ( a ladies' man ) but small in stature. I pictured a guy like Giancarlo Esposito in the role. Also, Cheadle could not do the deep southern accent Mouse speaks with in the book.But the most serious miscast was Jennifer Beals as Daphne a/k/a ""The Devil in the Blue Dress"", she was way too old for the part! In the book she was a beautiful teenager, 16 or 17 ( I can't remember exactly ) that could pass for white. Someone maybe like Lisa Bonet or even a young white actress should have played her. With this crucial error, the plot failed to make sense."
5,Don Cheadle Steals The Show,Denzel Washington is my favorite actor of all time and I have seen all his movies accept his new one coming out in 2006 ''The Inside Man''. until I saw this movie with alot of great performances. There was this one character that Don Cheadle played that I really enjoyed by the name of Mouse Alexander a quick-slick killer named Mouse Alexander. I thought Cheadle gave a great performance playing Mouse which leaves Denzel in the corner. I think if it wasn't for Don Cheadle this would've not have one of the great movies of 1995.
5,all that i expected,denzel washington and wesley snipes are my two favorite actors. this dvd rounds out my denzel collection nicely. this was a 'sleeper' movie that became a cult hit after its first run in theaters.
3,better than average book to movie,"Don Cheadle had the best lines. But the casting of Jennifer Beals and her makeup was a huge mistake, ruined the plot. I had read the book & as soon as she appeared I thought WTF. Imagine her as a blonde and it makes more sense."
5,denzel washington,"This dvd movie is like all the work of the great actor denzel washington, great entertainment very tastefully done. Jennifer Beals is a great supporting actress in this movie."
2,Needs a better transfer,This is a very good story with good characters and actors. It is a great pity that the dvd plays very dark and one loses the scenes and facial expressions due to an alost black screen far too often. Disappointing to say the least.
2,"Good acting and production values, but ultimately fails to engage the viewer","""Touch"" has characteristics of a well-crafted TV drama; namely, well-developed characters and a premise which is unique and initially engaging. However, once all the components of the story are assembled, the result is dull and contrived. Ultimately, everything will work out because the numbers say so. That's about it. So the viewer is basically promised some sort of magical happy ending from the get-go. The numbers are little more than an omnipotent deus ex machina, and there's no real mystery, wonder, or drama to the plot resolutions they achieve. All this makes for a boring and saccharine hour of television that really isn't worth investing in."
5,Touch is Excellent,"The show is excellent and upbeat. He is a sweeter, kinder Jack Bauer with all the intensity and the kid is wonderful"
2,Yawn Inducing,"Every episode of this show is exactly the same formula. The first show was pretty good. The next was ok. By the third, I'd lost interest and now flip the channel after American Idol. The social worker in the show is laughable. As a Master Social Worker myself, I can say that no social worker can just arbitrarily decide someone isn't right for their kid and take him/her, stick them in an institution and let the parent come and go as they please. The family court system would be involved. And in this case we have a father who obviously has money, has a nice loft, and loves and takes good care of his child. The child would never have been removed. The writers are very uninformed."
5,Totally original and completely engaging,In 2012 we should have expected this kind of story. . . one that shows us that we are connected in so many odd and wonderful ways. Sutherland is definitely not reprising his persona on 24. He shows much more vulnerability to the issues of his unusual son who doesn't speak. Both father and son Jake find ways to communicate while solving connection glitches between seemingly unrelated people. It looks like we're in for another season since Touch was renewed. This is a fresh approach that makes for great TV.
5,Very intriguing,"I'm totally hooked. I enjoyed ""Heroes"" (Heroes - Season One), pretty much; so far ""Touch"", from the same creators, has the feel of what Heroes could have been if it wasn't so wildly erratic."
4,Great!,I purchased these dvds for My 15 year old son. He really enjoys them. Good to find an engaging movie that is clean for the kids
3,just ok,"Watched the pilot on Amazon and didn't watch another episode. It was ok, but a little too predictable and unbelievable at the same time."
2,"Jake, Jake, Jake and more Jake","If you love hearing the word Jake you will love this TV show. I had such hopes for it, but after 3 episodes I quite watching. Sutherland's character ends up constantly running after his son Jake in efforts to protect him and says Jake all the time. Of course the boy has a special gift and pays no attention to his father. The twist and turns were interesting but the constant Jake thing just wore me out. It is a frustrating series to watch."
1,No way like 24,"Barely keeps you following what's going on. Nothing exciting, especially the past few episodes. Stopped watching last week. I was just watching because I liked Keifer Sutherland from 24. However here, the story doesn't make much sense. It is very boring and embarrassing. Some people say it's because the movie is about a weird idea, but nothing is more weird than Fringe. When you watch Fringe especially the fourth season, the story looks very convincing and keeps you following what's going on. Touch has a brite idea but just doesn't have a strong story.Overall it's more like a hype rather than a good movie. Things could change and maybe future episodes and seasons become better, but as of now, it's just so boring."
1,"Is there anyone else SICK and TIRED of Kiefer Sutherlands breathy whispering?,","Come on dude SPEAK LIKE A REAL ACTOR. What, do you think soft porn breathy is dramatic or something? Annunciate for Christ sake. It is so damm distracting that I can't even stand to watch anything that you are in. Or is breathy whispering your trademark like the dweeb knob is Steven Segal's? Well at least Segal is no longer sporting it. It's laughable."
3,This season was okay,"This show was okay, my husband lost interest about half way through (to give you an idea, some of our favorite shows are Madmen, Dexter, Modern Family, Revenge, etc) I might finish the season if I get bored and and have nothing else to do, but there are other shows that are more captivating."
3,Kiefer is amazing. But the story/dialogue are so contrived.,"As always, Kiefer Sutherland is extraordinary. He's at his best when he's running and yelling.The plot is so contrived; it gets irritating quickly. In this episode, Clea turns her back for 3 seconds; in that period of time, Jake managed to fingerpaint 4 numbers and then disappear from the room without making a sound (try that). She runs to look for him; in the cut away, he is slowly walking around downstairs, yet he has already disappeared by the time she gets there (so he walks faster than she runs?).I don't mean to nit-pick, but can't they find ways for him to get away that don't require time to freeze? The conversations are similarly contrived. They need better writers."
2,Disappointing,"I loved ""Heroes"" so I thought ""Touch"" would continue this writer's success. However, while it does have some attractive carryovers from Heroes -- most notably realistic-seeming foreign locales and (subtitled) dialogue, it verges on self-parody right out of the gate. The excellent Kiefer Sutherland has to work really hard with a woefully underwritten part and can't get the character to be believable. Too many scenes of his following his autistic kid and yelling: ""Jake, Jake, don't go there! Jake. Jakle, come back! Jake, Jake, be careful!"" led me to stop watching after the third episode."
5,Loved it.,"His faith in his son's abilities is touching. He's a broken man who loves his son enough to risk it all. The numbers are really interesting. Knowing children with autism, its fascinating to take the unusual talents they have another step further - almost into a spiritual realm."
5,Touch,"Great price, great series, great service! It was no less than $40 everywhere I looked around Christmas time, but I was able to finally find it by sheer luck on Amazon for half the price! It is a touching/intriguing series...especially fun if you are a fan of Keifer Sutherland."
3,Very energetic!,"An interesting recording that is of excellent quailty. All voices and bells and other musical instruments are crystal clear and at the appropiate recording levels. The tonality of the vocal music can to tinny and high pitched at times, hard to the sensative ear, and the majority of bells that are used are high pitched as well. A tough hear if one is used to the deep resonous tones."
3,Great sci-fi surprise in would-be technothriller,"When mysterious accidents plague American and Soviet military units (I read this book in 1988), the superpowers are pushed to the brink of war. A team of fringe scientists, however, sees a more ominous cause behind the strange mishaps, one that goes beyond politics and transforms your typical cold-war technothriller into a doomsday tale along the lines of that great Brit sci-fi flick ""The Day the Earth Caught Fire"". Unfortunately, the author waits a tad too long to make the transformation, leaving his best charachters a bit underdone. Still, once the charachters are brought in, author Wheeler doesn't just jump to the chase, but prolongs the mystery and the scientific underpinnings of the story."
4,"Oh, man, is this exciting.","I've been voraciously reading this book for a week, and it is so exciting. Plus, I met Dr. Wheeler at an astro lecture, so it is fun to read sci-fi where you know the physics is *right*. It elegantly captures the tension of the Cold War, and it is a wonderful mystery story."
4,Flagg waving,A very entertaining story. Not a block buster but I enjoyed the whole story. Held my attention and it was a fast read.
4,A fun and easy read,"I think we all have known an Aunt Elner kind of relative, or wish we did. Her story was an affirmation of the goodness that life has to offer - here on earth and hopefully beyond. This is a feel good book (as all Flagg's books are), and it was full of the down home kind of characters that she's so well known for. There are lots of laughs to be had in this story, and although it's much breezier than Fried Green Tomatoes, it didn't seem too sweet. As with her other books, the characters are very well developed and believable. The way Elner's death brought the town together was a charming touch. Beyond the comedy, there are some nice moments that made me reflect on my own life, and the lives of those I love.It has been quite a while since I've read a book by Flagg, and I'm glad to have spent more time with her. When I finished reading I thought to myself: Wouldn't it be nice if heaven were as she described in the book? I hope it is."
2,What Happened?,"I so enjoy Fannie's writing...but this one fell flat. I returned it to the library half finished because i was so bored with it, i didn't want to even pick it up to finish. Hopefully her next one will be a winner!"
2,Terrible Theology - Trite premiss,"I have always been a fan of Fanny Flagg's novels - she has such a quirky sense of humor and creates such lovable characters. I usually want to live in the town of the novel. But not this time. I was really disappointed in this novel. Disgusted too. Even if you're not Christian, I can't see anyone liking the heaven that she interprets here. Not only that, but many of the characters back on earth are either shallow or their problems are solved by a word of sage advice from the main character. Gag. Don't waste your time with this one."
2,Can't Wait to Get to Heaven,"Not that great - she's done a lot better - ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" for instance -"
2,error on page 111,I am reading this book and don't find it as good as Fannie's other books. Too much fantasy. Another reviewer mentioned a serious error on page 111. I can't find it. There is a small grammatical error but I assumed that was intentional. What did I miss?
2,no brainer,"I read it. I finished it. I put it down and didn't speak of it again. Not my style: Too much floof - not enough substance. However, if this is your thing, it's not poorly written. There are other books out there that are much better. Mitch Album did one, and then there was Lovely Bones. If you want a book on the fictional heaven, I would try one of those first."
3,"Modestly inspirational without being maudlin, a fun read.","The story flowed, the oddball characters delighted, and Flagg's view of life on earth and beyond through the eyes of Mrs. Elner Shimfissle comforted my soul. Octogenarian Elner has perfected the ""live and let live"" philosophy, and we slowly discover how her life has influenced those around her. Revealing much of the story would spoil a few surprises. Suffice it to say that, when faced with misfortune, all of the characters learn from the experience and become better for it. Perhaps a bit simplistic, but I don't need to get whacked over the head with deep symbolism with every book I read. The book was difficult to put down, a disappointment when it ended and a pleasure to read."
2,Did anyone notice a problem with the fig tree?,"I've been a huge fan of Fannie Flagg, but I was tempted to put this book down and not finish it. It was the size of the fig tree that put a bad taste in my mouth for this book. Since when do fig trees grow the size of shade trees? As a reader of fiction I can only suspend belief for so much. I wish I had just waited for the paperback version instead of investing in the hardback."
3,"Can't Wait is a nice, light read","While I have read only one other title by Fannie Flagg, I found Can't Wait to Get to Heaven as enjoyable as the other I read. The book is humorous, contemporary and light. The characters are loveable and down-to-earth.I felt that the author could have expanded upon Elner's journey to Heaven, but was creative with what was written -despite reviewers who are appalled by Flagg's characterization of God. Since none of us know what the afterlife is like (if there is an afterlife), Flagg has made a creative and playful attempt to explain this great mystery of life or the beginning of life in the hereafter.Loved the book and I recommend it. While the book will certainly not become a great literary classic, it is a nice, easy read for vacation, a plane ride or a weekend by the fire."
5,Just Plain Five Star Fun,"If you enjoyed Flagg's Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whstle Stop Cafe ( as I did ), you will like Can't Wait to Get to Heaven.What's not to like, extremely well written, wonderful warm characters, small town America nostalgia, several ""put down the book and laugh out loud "" moments, fun story line, etc.And then there is Tom Edison, and Ginger Rogers, too.Unqualified recommendation, even for those of you who might be like me, not particularly inclined to read warm fuzzy relationship books."
5,Elner's life well lived,"Fannie Flagg continues to keep her place on my list of favorite authors.When all the problems of the world seem so big, it is a treat to rememberthat a life well lived changes the world one person at a time. This book wasfun to read and conveys a strong message without preaching. I was attendingthe Prairie Festival at the Land Institute in Salina, Kansas when I read thisbook listening to wise speakers talk of being open to new ideas and ways ofliving and solving problems. This book fit right in."
5,Loved this book,"Lots of laugh out loud moments. I loved the characters and all their quirks. Keep writing, Fannie."
5,Wonderful Life In Written Form,"I read this during the holidays and it puts that ""It's a Wonderful Life"" feeling in your heart! What a great read this was. Fannie Flagg mixes humor with a touch of heaven. This book is sensational and a great book to curl up with a cup of tea, comforter on a snowy day. Can't say enough good things about it !"
4,Read it for a book club.,"I bought and read this book for a book club. I never even knew that the actress Fannie Flagg was an author before this. The book spent a lot of time developing the characters, and took a lot of turns. It was a quick read and I enjoyed it."
4,A LOVABLE AND LAUGHABLE READ,"If you enjoy books involving small town characters (such as Fried Green Tomatoes), you'll enjoy this fast/easy read for a ""play on afterlife and return to earth"" for the main character, 96-year old Elmer, who really doesn't know how old she is?? Fannie Flagg's descriptions of the town's inhabitants are so lovable and laughable, and everyone should have an ""Elmer"" in their life...and hope getting a short trip to heaven will be as great an experience? This book delves a bit into the unknown in a humorous way and leaves you wondering, ""WHO KNOWS""??"
5,Such Fun (And So Sorry When It Ended)!,"Some people guffaw when they read, but I'm not one of them--generally. This book had me howling with laughter and slapping my knee. What a happy, feel-good book. What a great sense of humor. I'm jealous of anyone who has not yet read it."
5,"Sweet, Guiltless Pleasure","What a treat! Especially if you listen to the author read the tale, with that expressive drawl. And the characters--Mrs. Elner Shimfissel is a gem, reminiscent of Arsnic and Old Lace. A story that reminded me that people still laugh and love, almost forgot that."
4,Entertaining,"If you like an easy-to-read book about a well-liked elderly lady in a small town atmosphere with a great deal of humor thrown in, this book may be for you. Aunt Elner Shimfissle is the central character and is quite a character. Her closest kin are her niece, Norma and Norma's husband Macky. Norma is a born worrier so Macky has a lot of responsibility with Aunt Elner. After an unusual accident Elner is taken by ambulance to a Kansas City hospital. While there she enjoys a magical visit to heaven and is thrilled to meet others who have gone before. The description of heaven is one which would hardly meet the expectation of any religious person regardless of religion. In this story God's name is Raymond and he is married to Dorothy. This ""God"" is not perfect or ""all knowing."" He smokes a pipe and is God to Christians, Buddhists, Muslims and most everyone else. However, even in the heaven discussions some good points are made."
1,UTTERLY DISAPPOINTED,"I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A BIG FAN OF FANNIE FLAGG. WHEN I FIRST STARTED READING THIS BOOK I THOUGHT IT WAS WONDERFUL. THE CHARACTERS WERE SO FUNNY AND YOU SOON FELT LIKE YOU KNEW THEM ALL PERSONALLY. SHE'S A GOOD WRITER FOR SURE. BUT LESS THAN HALF WAY THROUGH THE BOOK, I CAME UPON A CHAPTER THAT BROKE MY HEART AND I THREW THE BOOK IN THE TRASH.THIS BOOK IS DEFINATELY NOT FOR ANY TRUE CHRISTIAN THAT KNOWS OUR TRUE HEAVENLY FATHER OF THE HOLY BIBLE. NO, OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN IS NOT NAMED RAYMOND WHO SMOKES CIGARS, NOR DOES HE HAVE A WIFE NAMED DOROTHY THAT HELPED HIM IN CREATING THE UNIVERSE!HOW HORRIBLE TO REPRESENT OUR TRUE GOD OF THE BIBLE IN SUCH A MOCKED WAY. FANNIE FLAGG BLEW IT BIG TIME WITH THIS BOOK.SHE HAS A RIGHT TO THINK WHAT SHE WANTS ABOUT OUR GOD AND TO MAKE HIM OUT IN ANY FORM SHE WANTS, BUT THIS IS NOT A BOOK FOR A TRUE CHRISTIAN. IT WILL REALLY MAKE YOU MAD. BEING UTTERLY DISAPPOINTED IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT."
3,Feel-good Southern Literature,"Can't Wait to Get to Heaven is feel good Southern American fiction. It's about an elderly woman who falls off her ladder while picking figs and has an afterlife adventure while all her friends and family adjust to her sudden and unexpected death, and even more unexpected recovery. It's funny, sweet, and entertaining. A good read for people who want to reminisce about their own loved ones who've passed away, as well as people who just enjoy some good fluffy reading, with good moral and family values."
4,Can't Wait to Get to Heaven,"This was a fun book to read. I was interested in Fannie Flagg's ideas on what might await us in heaven. I don't think she's right in everything, but I guess we won't know until we get to heaven, too! I especially liked the ending, where you were given what changed in everyone's lives because she came back from heaven for a short time."
2,Flat,The story was flat and boring most of the way through. The typical irreverent style was more annoying & offensive. I was very disappointed in this book. Not the usual Fannie Flagg.
4,Fannie Does It Again,"You catch up with your Missouri friends Norma, Aunt Elner, Mackie and others. Nothing's ever going to stay quite the same, but we find all works out in the end."
4,Great Summer Read,I enjoyed this book very much. I've recommended it to others and plan to read it again. When you finish this book you feel great!
3,Fiction is always fiction...,"A sweet book. I liked Elners' version of Heaven. Her simple way ofthinking about life made her a ""Grand"" person in all her friends and families lives. Maybe you can learn something from fiction after all."
2,Not as good as past novels,"I love Fannie Flagg's writing - and have enjoyed her past books. Sadly - this time around - this title does not measure up to her usual fine quality. Her past novels were glib, engaging, heartfelt... This installment is flat. Great characters - but they don't go anywhere. I have loved her past works - folksy, charming, real characters that you wish you knew. In the past - I could not put down her books and could not wait for this to come out. This one - I literally put down half way through. I was disappointed."
3,enjoyable,"This is not great literature, but it is an enjoyable turn of the page. It should remind all readers that it really does matter how we treat each other -- and that good deeds are not forgotten by the receiver."
3,I finished it,"Looking for some lighter reading and remembering Fried Green Tomatoes, which I loved, I ordered Can't Wait to Get to Heaven. If you are looking for any depth in the content forget this book. The author uses the book to express many of her personal opinions; political, about hospital experience today, liberal values most of which I would agree with it is not what I was looking for in the book. If you are looking for any depeth in the after life experience you will not find it. The book is a light read and there are some laughs but if also drags at times."
1,Not so much a star as a dark hole.,"This book tries hard to recapture the hilarity of Fried Green Tomatoes, but it flops harder than an 18-wheeler dropped from the top of the Empire State Building. Undoubtedly the most disappointing book I've read in years.Actually not 100% true... I wasn't even able to finish reading it."
1,Shame on Ms. Flagg,"What was it Dorothy Parket said in her review of a performance by Katherine Hepburn: 'She ran the gamut of emotions from A to B.'Sad to say, Miss Flagg didn't even get to A with her latesteffort.She made us care for the people she wrote of in 'Fried Green Tomatoes At the Whistle Stop Cafe.' In this novel, she seems to 'painting by numbers,' so to speak. Writing through formula rather than from the heart."
2,book and cd's,can't give a review it was given as a gift as were the other two products i purchased i assume they liked them as they did'nt say otherwise
5,A COMFORTING READ!,"Like Jan Karon, Lori Copeland, Mignon Ballard and Nancy Atherton this book is an old comforter on a cold night. Look for a fifty-ish kind of read, a faith based attitude and a short cry at the end of the story. Fannie Flagg is a wonder and a relief from the violence on TV. If you want to escape to yesteryear and hope and belief in people - this is the book for you. Read all of Flagg's books - they have the same comforting level that make you just feel good when the book is finished. Excellent reading!"
5,GREAT NOVEL!,Can't Wait To Get To Heaven is one of Fannie's best novels. The book will have you laughing and crying from the beginning until the endIt is a book written from the heart with poignant and true mannerisms of the characters. If you read STANDING IN THE RAINBOWyou will love the continuation and continuity of these belovedcharacters. It is down home America and a feel good book.Forget your troubles and immerse yourself in this can't stop reading book.
5,Almost as good as the book. Good movie about the Corps,I first saw the movie in 1956 and it was in color. I have seen the movie at least 30 times and it has always been in color. I have never watch this movie in black and white.
5,Battle Cry,"I have read the book 25 times or more and have seen the movie Boo Ku times. I even bought the sound track on Amazon.com last week. The movie and the book helped to form my thoughts on joining the Corps when I was a little boy growing up in the 50's. So, as a former Marine who has a son with 3rd Tracks I can say that Battle Cry is by far the best Marine Corps movie out there. It may not be all blood and guts. But, then most of a Marines life is not all blood and guts. Its garrison duty and field training. It can be lonely, boring, fun, mind numbing, girl chasing. Not to mention a big drunk at times. The Corps is made up of a cross section of American youth as is portrayed in Battle Cry. We all can relate to Huxley, Mac, Danny, Ski, Andy, LQ, the Farmer, Tex, Padro, Gomez, Rea, Kathy, Nancy, etc.I may be biased And I am. But, Battle Cry is the best!,"
1,"DVD Not For Me, But The Film Is","Won't buy this DVD because it's in 1.33-1 pan-&-scan format while the original film is in 2.55-1 CinemaScope. Why must DVD releasers crunch fine CinemaScope movies into horrid 1.33-1 pan-&-scan?The film, in its original aspect ratio, I love, but I refuse to buy it on a disc that circumcised it into pan-&-scan."
4,A pretty good film,"This would have been a great film if they had left out all of the soap opera aspects. Good characters and interesting story, with pretty good productions values"
1,Faulty Disk Review,"The cd of the movie Battle Cry is faulty. The first 1/2 hour of the movie does not play. There is a split screen thing going on that shows the title screen on one part and the movie on the other. The movie fits and starts, skipping several minutes at a time. Sometimes there is no sound and sometimes sound with static. After 1/2 hour it plays along fine. I played several other disks as well as the Battleground to make sure that there isn't something wrong with my player. They are all fine. Sounds like a damaged disk slipped through the cracks."
3,"A good movie, ruined","I think that this is a highly underrated war movie. The story has a certain realism that most typical ""yay for our side"" war movies lack, and that is possibly the reason why this film doesn't show up on TNT every month. The only problem is that this edition has been colorized (and poorly at that). My father is one of the Marine extras used in some of the drill scenes, and due to the colorization he can't even pick himself out of the crowd. If there's ever a re-release of the original B&W version, I'll be first in line to grab it. (By the way; make it a DVD, please!)"
2,"forget about battle this is just ""days of our lives "" and not even as good","battle cry lurches foward at a snails pace and for a war movie very little fighting goes on,just long stares off to nothing and some romance. really with all the people involved in this it should be better. a waste of time!!!"
2,where's the battle or even the cry,this would be epic of men in world war II is lifeless and as dull as they come. very little battles are shown and little else happans in this long boreing movie. check out the longest day it's better
5,Excellent adaptation of Uris novel,"An outstanding motion picture which deserves a widescreen release on VHS. By the way, viewer from Minneapolis, the film was originally released in Warnercolor and CinemaScope not in black and white. (Fox, the owners of CinemaScope, didn't allow black and white releases in the process in 1955)"
2,Could be alot better,"I had this camera over a year and i hate it. You have to hold it exactly still for 3-4 seconds and if you move it, it will mess the picture up. you can't take any decent pictures inside and when you take them outside.If your taking pictures of nature or art or anything that don't have motion and isn't a person then buy it. others wise save your money.one thing I loved about this camera is that it doesn't take batteries and you can charge it up by putting the usb port into your pc."
4,Decent pocket camera for the price,"I've been using my 130 for well over a year now. Yes, the picture quality isn't the best. It needs to be held very steady, and taking pictures indoors is hit or miss (usually miss) It is quite handy though, and easy to always have around. I haven't found a better slim pocket camera for under $200.The metal case especially is great, as it means this camera can live with keys and other pocket items that could seriously damage a lesser armored camera.One can't fault the lack of a screeen for a camera this inexpensive, and the built-in battery is easily enough that you'll almost never have to worry about charging the camera (through the USB connector) leave it plugged in overnight once a month, and you're good to go."
4,Great for what it is,"Don't expect this to be a great quality camera, it's not, and it's not meant to be. It's meant to be small, which it is, and fun, which it is. It's also durable feeling, and the photo quality is plenty good enough for email and the internet. It's cheap, too."
2,Blurry off-center pictures,"The pictures are blurry and off-center. I tried many tests to see if it was my unsteady hand causing the problems, but determined it was the camera. I took both indoor and outdoor pictures - both came out terrible."
2,Does not live up to the hype,"I bought this camera after reading positive reviews on amazon and the web. Don't believe the reviews. The camera is on its way back to amazon as I type this. It is not worth the money.The pictures come out good if you can hold the camera still long enough for the camera to take the picture. You push the shutter release and have to wait 2-3 seconds before you can move.Also, the lens is not ""true."" You have to be pointing the camera perfectly at what you want to get what you think you are getting. No room for error."
3,Sooo much colour,"From the very moment you open the cover, the photos in this book are very obviously ""glossy magazine"" photos. The colour is incredibly rich. The has obviously been a lot of work put into setting up each photo, and they would work well in magazine format. It was a little strange to see them set out in a book like this, but does it makes for a really interesting book. Whilst it isnt an ""elite fashion photography"" book, I dont think it is trying to be. It is simply a nice collection of photos of some of the popular people (eg. singer, actors) form our era. Mark Seliger and Isabel Snyder are superb fashion photographers, and it really shows in this book. Their photos really stand out from all others in the book, and are all incredibly good photos taken in an interesting manner. Its a good book to sit back on a couch with during the day, with some good tunes in the background."
4,At Least I Saw It,"Don't you just love it when people who haven't seen the book (and can't spell) post reviews, like the two below? No? I don't either.For those of you who don't judge a book by it's cover, you just might like this one. It has some of the best pictures from Rolling Stone in it. Judge for yourself."
5,If you want to Worship our Lord this Album is AWESOME,"I was first introduced to Vineyard Music about 20 years ago, The ""Lift Jesus Higher"" song made me cry every time I heard it. So I had to find out more about the Vineyard Ministry. We do not Worship our Lord the way we should, Most of our worship songs are written long ago, and some of them sound so 50's and 70's that I feel like the church is out of date. And Young People even myself hate Old Music. Bring new life into your Church. Vineyard Ministries have a great program for churches with a Mission to Help Churches Worship our Lord and give Praise. The spritual uplifting of these songs will bring into tears, weaping in Joy for giving praise to our Lord. Warning if you use this CD while Driving, People will think you are nuts while raising your hands to the Lord while Driving. If you wish to Give Praise to the Almighty High! This CD Rocks! (PS No I don't work for VineYard Ministries, I just work for our Lord.) God Bless..."
3,candle review,Candle was very nice only thing i did not like was that i paid full price for this candle . I looked underneath the tin and there was a sticker that was marked with $5.00 on it . I was not to happy to find this.
1,Poor Mechanism,"Despite oiling the lock entry, I still have the dickens of a time getting my key into this cap every time I stop for a fill-up. The ""sliding gate"" just doesn't want to move out of the way. So I fumble around until it finally works. Look elsewhere ..."
5,The Big Issues to Music,"If you are already a John Adams fan, this one is a must-have. The other reviews give a better musical critique than I am able to. Adams likes to tackle the big issues of the day in music. However, if you haven't seen the opera or don't know the story, it'd be best to do some research online or buy the full version with the story. As one of those who remember the event, the impact comes as much from the libretto as the music."
5,Amazing!,"This is John Adams at his finest, writing with a truly distinct voice. Calling this music ""minimalist"" does it disservice. In fact, there's only problem with this recording: I liked it so much that I had to splurge and buy the 3-disk complete opera!"
3,Sheep skins are great but this one was skimpy and the dye washed out,"It may still be worth purchasing, but the one they sent me was thinner than a sheepskin I had ordered directly from New Zealand via a different company a couple years back and doesn't seem to be of the same quality.I've washed this skin precisely once in my washing machine and it has changed color--becoming a light gray. Disappointing. The other rug I mentioned has gone through several similar washings with no significant change.But my little daughter still likes it and enjoys kneeling on it as she plays (the floor is tile), and it's still attractive. And the price was pretty low."
3,Classic Kiss,"This is the reissue and it is on 180g vinyl. But the sound is just ok to me. I do not have the greatest turntable at the moment so maybe that has something to do it, as well as it was originally recorded in the 70's. Nonetheless I have always been a huge Kiss fan and it's a must have if you like them."
5,Brilliant,"This album is amazing. I heard Ann in person last fall in Hollywood and she did most of these songs in concert- this album captures all that and more. The arrangements, the musicians, the perfect engineering and capturing of her music- and Ann's phenomenal vocal talent add up to many MANY hours of listening to this CD over and over.And Sarah Vaughn is up there smiling somewhere - when she hears Ann's opener ""Tenderly"" in tribute to her. Miss Callaway has obviously spent MANY HOURS listening to, and soaking in the greatness of the artists she pays tribute to here. It shows....."
3,Beauty can be blinding,"everytime i listen to ann, i am so taken by her beauty, inside and out. her interviews show her to be lively, thoughtful and passionate. i want to love her and make her my diva--but the fact remains--i'm not sure what is behind that relentless beauty. she's not cold--i just don't get the real emotional jolt i get from singers who have put more of their guts into the material. i'm not looking for ella to become billie--i just think there is so much more ""there"" there and i want her to dig it out and show it to us. when she stops being afraid of who she is and how she would be seen if someone knew her secret--(and believe me they'd only find you hotter and more interesting) she will give us her own signature--the only one that really counts."
1,Signature is a forgery,"I'm a big fan of Miss Callaway's. I've seen her many times in cabarets, but the concept of this album is sheer folly. She's very talented, but not talented enough to stand comparisons with Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, etc. She never really put her stamp on the material, and each cut only makes me think of the earlier, and superior, original. I have all of Miss Callaway's CDs, but this one is the one I'll be playing the least."
2,Unable to see display,"I bought this item thinking at $29.99 was too good to be true. Well, I was correct. The display is not bright, in fact, you can't see the numbers unless you get your nose down to the scale, by then, the 20seconds they allow you to save your information is up and it shuts off. I would not recommed this scale to anyone. I will pay a little more and get something better. I do like the features though, and will continue to look for something similar."
1,Skip this scale!,"I've head this scale for over a year, and the numbers can vary 1-3 lbs within five minutes--not very accurate. Second, you cannot see the numbers on the screen-terribly lit screen. Third, now just after a year, it just shows an E and there is no remedy in the instructions on how to fix it when E appears.It feels cheap when you step on it as it creeks and cracks and I am a normal weight of 130 lbs.Shame on Health o Meter for promising much with this gadget and delivering nothing of real value. You cannot see nor turst the numbers--then the whole thing just goes kaput after a year."
1,Lose 5 lbs. in just 5 minutes!,"Yes, you can be just like me, and every morning lose up to 5 lbs. as each successive weighing bounces all over. I got this scale to keep track of my weight, and it has been almost entirely worthless in this regard. Hard to read like others have said, but a scale that can't reliably measure weight is not really a scale."
2,Scale with a short life,I bought this less than a year ago. It is now totally worthless and will wind up in the trash. It worked fine until recently and then the readings became erratic. Won't buy another of this brand.
1,False Advertising,"For those of you who care the back cover photo of this item indicates that the disc is the European edition of this collection. In fact, that is false advertising. There is, as I know because I was sent it, an American edition of this CD. This muckup is yet another example of Amazon laziness. Presumably they can't be bothered to get the photos right (particularly when they can borrow them from Amazon.uk) just as they can't be bothered to weed out reviews for DVD's when a new transfer of a film has come out. They seem to assume that once you have seen one transfer you have seen them all. Sloppy if not ""criminal"" practise.As to the Bernstein Gershwin, it is not bad. As commentators have noted, however, Bernstein makes cuts in the score (boo) and these performances seem more Bernstein than Gershwin (boo).So to sum up three stars for this performance and 0 stars for Amazon."
2,Song list is incorrect,"This cd is NOT an import version of the Tomato releases Early Years v1 and v2, which product description would have you believe. I ordered it and this is a much earlier collection around '47/48, from Savoy sessions, likely recorded under one of JLH's aliases and rereleased. Buyer beware. The song list above is not correct."
4,Wow.,"Pokemon Sapphire is one of the best GBA games you can get. You can't really get better than 2-on-2 battles, that awesome multiplayer thing, and the neat graphics. There's shameless plugging, too (there's a GCN with a GBA as the controller in your room automatically :P), andthat's always fun.Overall: Get it, you'll be glad."
4,GOOD GAME!!!,"this is the best pokemon game so far!! I recently got this game and it RULES!!!! the Graphics are awesome, and there are like 200 new pokemon, all new gym leaders, and 2 on 2 batteling!! And the best thing is,it's not one of those games when youre into it and then it just sits in your game boy advance and you forget about it. It's an awesome game, and i HIGLY recomend it to any pokemon fans out there: ""GET THIS GAME""!!!"
4,Torchic!,"This is a game with great graphics for a 2-D game, esspecially for Pokemon (not an insult). Water reflections, weather conditions, footprints, 135 (exactly) new Pokemon... Nice work, Nintendo! Here's a recommendod team for Sapphire: Torchic(Fire/Flying), Mudkip(Water/Ground), Heracross, Latios(Phychic/Dragon), Sableye(Dark/Ghost), and Cocodora(Steel/Rock). Pokemon contests, berries that improve contest status, Boy or girl as main character, Torchic, Treecko, and Mudkip are the next starters, and that's a wrap(don't ask why I did that, please)!"
1,Didn't Work,"The video did'nt work, and the company STILL has not returned my email about it!! Will NEVER buy from them"
1,review,"i was very dissapointed and upset about this purchase..This particular item was a fake, and when i tried to return it to the sender, the link said it didnt exist anymore..the game never even loaded, never worked, and was never even able to play it.i have never had an experience from amazon like this before, and am not happy with it at all.i will never purchase a used product again.thank you."
1,Same old same old,this game is horrible. one of my frriends have it and the only thing new is those weird 2 on 2 battles. i think that they should stop making this game. its getting old.
5,Best of all the Pokemon Games!!,"Man, I love this game! I have Pokemon Gold, Yellow, and Crystal, but this one BY FAR is the best! Not only do you get to have your own hangout, but your ""dad"" is a gymleader! The graphics are superior to the other games, and you can learn more about your Pokemon, and the Pokemon info has an awesome layout!!! All hail!"
4,Some info about this game,This game improved a lotcompared to the other versions.you can pick gender and pick 1 pokemon out of 3 of course.But the problem about this game is there isn't any pokemon from gold and silver and some from red and blue.for the people that pick torchic it is not flying type and fire just fire and when it envoles it turns to fire/fighting.I picked mudskip cuz it does well in the starting gym leaders.the pokemon on the cover of each pokemon are the 2nd rarest on the game.the rarest is like lugia but it is the same type and it is lv 70 for both versions.you can use the master ball you get in the game to catch those rare pokemon.when you play the sapphire the enemys are team aqua for ruby it is team magma.
4,Sapphire : ),"A really good action game, Even though they took out some of the old Pokemon.: ( There isn't too much to do after you defeat the Elite four. But Pokemon fans won't be dissapointed!"
4,I just wanna say,"That I'm almost 40, and I love the pokemon games. They're not just for little kids, and they are certainly something I can Share with my kids. I guess I'm just a PokeMom..."
4,"Nintendo: smart, or out of their mind?","When I first bought these games on poke'mon some 3 or so years ago I thought they were the best games ever made. I was even more suprised when there counterparts gold, silver, and crystal came out. Then I had figured out that you could trade back and fourth between all of them. Then when I was strolling through a store I saw an advertisement and the ""Cool"" pokemon the game possesd, I went nuts! I think it was a little foolish that nintendo did this for two reasons: Pokemon, aare pretty much over. And the new pokemon look somewhat ""unattractive, or uncarismatic if you will"". Then I thought of haveing a whole new world to explore in the game and thought it might be fun, and the ""hip"" thing to would be to purchase them. All over all this game will probobly be fun and challengeing in Its own way, but these new flashy games,(no Quotes)will never replace the origional pokemon games.(P.S. Why didn't nintendo release pokemon green in america?)"
4,Pokemon ruby / sappier,it is a very intesting game but is confusing though. but if u get the guide for it it is much easy but cost more money.
4,pokemon is back!!!,This game is great!I got it the day it came out and I am now hooked on pokemon again.I already have all 8 badges but I dont know how to get to the pokemon leage. If someone finds out then post it on a review.well finally pokemon is back and better than ever.There is now differant weather but no day or night.Despite that I gave the game 5 stars and would have given it more. Tis game is a must by.team rocket gav up and now team aqua came in.Just because team aqua has a stupid name doesn't make them easy.They are hard core and so is there boss Archie.I hoped my reveiw helped and untill next time.
4,Pok'emon Fever is back!!!,"I JUST GOT HOOKED ON POKEMON FOR THE SECOND TIME IN OVER 4 YEARS. THIS GAME IS BETTER LOOKING , BETTER SOUNDING , 200 POK'EMON (MORE THAN EVER) THE BEST FEATURE IS 2 ON 2 BATTLES THEY LET YOU CONTROL WHICH ONE WILL ATTACK WHICH ONE DEFINITE MUST BUY FOR EVERY ONE"
3,Just OK game,"This game was OK. Nothing exciting, but just alright. There are better Pokemon games out there. Would not recommend if you are an avid Pokemon fan."
4,Great Pokemon game,"My 7 year old son really likes this game. He said this is a really fun game with cool Pokemon. He has both Ruby and Sapphire and likes Sapphire a little more than Ruby, but both are very fun."
4,I Love this Game So Much!!!!,"I like Sapphire. That is why I think I'm going to get one on my birthday. I already know the game because my friends have the guide book.I don't want to spoil the game so you can find out on your own. I am a big fan of Poke'mon. I already have some of the great games...I know the starting Poke'mon.1.Treeko-Groville-Spectile2.Torchic-Combusken-Blazeican3.Mudkip-Marshstomp-SwampertMy favorite Poke'mon(s) is(are) Mudkip-Marshstomp-Swampert, Todidile-Croconaw-Feraligator, and Squirtle-Warturtle-Blastiose. My favorite type is water, ice, and dark.I like dark the most because they come in the night. You can e-mail me & be pen pals...I would like to start with Mudkip. I can tell you how Swampert can learn Hydropump(Swampert cannot learn Hydropump)...I LOVE POKE'MON!!!!!!!"
4,same as ruby...,"really there is no difference in the versions of pokemon except that there is different pokemon in each one and somtimes there are different characters. also the covers. so I don't really mind playing ether one, both are good for me."
5,The Best Game of Pokemon I've seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is awesome, the other games compared to this one are like an ant. I love this game all my friends in the school have it.This grafics are much better and also there's so much mure adventures. The new pokemons are so cool! I recomend you to buy this game, you'll enjoy it."
2,Pokemon Yellow was better!!!,"You know what I think? I think it is a really great game with a lot of flaws. I starts out as a fun, cute little game, BUT... the gym leaders get too hard too fast. The first gym leader was easy, but then, it seems that the seventh leaders were out their teenage minds(they could read minds too)!!! The leaders catch up too fast! Also, if you don't choose the right pokemon... KABLOOEE!!! The whole thing goes to heck!!!So over all, I gave it a C-."
2,So-So,"This game is horrible. Im basing this off of actual gameplay. Since I am anbiased gamer, I can say that this game series needs to end! The creators think that adding new PokeMon will save the series! Well it can not and will not. Adding new Pokemon, and a few new perks just is getting boring. Also there is basicly no stradegy whatso ever! Its like the stronger of the two will win, and nothing else. Its sooo boring looking for people to battle and just walking around getting badges is old too!!"
3,Sapphire,"This game is great!The only reason I knocked 2 stars off is that they don't have all the 150 original pokemon in it! You have to trade to get the original 150 with Leaf Green and Fire Red to get them, but still you can't get all of them. It was a real dissapointment to me.Anyways, you can battle with 2 pokemon at a time now if you are battling 2 people. It's cool! You can also take advantage of this. You can use protect for one pokemon, while doing a attack that hurts all pokemon in one hit (including your pokemon).Another reason I knocked off 2 stars is that you can't get to the old citys, like the ones in Crystal, Silver, and gold version and in Blue, Yellow, and Red version.They have it so that you can take berrys off trees and replant them somewhere else!And you even get to be in Pokemon Contests and make Pokeblocks and feed them to your pokemon!To all Pokemon Fans - I recommend you buy this."
3,sapphire,"this game is okay ,but it needs more reality in it like, in pokemon stadium the pokemon doing awsome blows one by one, with great graphics or like people traviling with you,or stuff that happens on pokemon advance (on t.v.)."
4,So cool!,"I got this game once and lost it. Now I'm buying it again. That shows how much I like it.This game is really cool, and it has graphics that blow away the other games. Instead of a mechanical bleeps for music, this stuff is real. Very small pixles make the images crystal clear, and the people look more, eh.. peopleish than in red and blue (where people looked like a two-ball snowman with eyes). It is a bummer that you can't trade with all of the other ones though. But still, its a great game.One problem, though, is that I miss team rocket! Their whole evilness is gone from the game, and I miss it.This game has sweet graphics. It looks so real! (for a gameboy game, anyway). Even though these games appear childish (like the other review said) they're really cool. They have a really uniqe style which I really like. Pokemon has and always will be my favorite type of game. Anyone who puts it down is a stereotyper or a to-be-critique. POKEMON RULES!"
5,Awesome game!,"I have to admit, back in 1998, when i first saw Pokemon red, i was completely unimpressed. I never even gave it a second thought until about two months ago when i saw Sappire version on the shelf. After looking at the website, i was very impressed by the graphics, and so i decided to give it a try. I am very glad i did.Graphics: 10/10excellent graphics for the GBA, i have never seen better.Plot: 7/10The plot was too simple, and Team aqua abd the Elite four were incredibly easy.Gameplay: 9/10The only reason this didn't get a ten was because it only holds one game file! that is EXTREMELY stupid!Overall: 8/10i also wish i could link up with friendswho have previous editions of Pokemon, but oh well, it's a great game as it is.If you are even considering getting sapphire, rush down to your local video game store and buy it right away!I hope this review helped!"
4,they took them away!!,"one thing about this game that prevents it from getting 5 stars is..NOT EVERY POKEMON IS IN THIS GAME!! about 70% of the pokemon on here are the new ones. they only have a few of the old pokemon, but they TOOK ALL THE GOOD POKEMON AWAY!! no lickitung, no mr.mime, AND NO AMPHAROS!! :'(...and YOU CAN'T TRADE WITH THE OLD GAMES..., BUT THEY IMPROVED A FEW THINGS. the BOX SYSTEM IS BETTER. it takes much less time to change boxes and find a pokemon, and there's also two kinds of bikes now, the acro bike and the mach bike. the acro bike is slower, but can get you through certain obstacles the mach bike can't, and the mach bike is just a fast bike. they have more legendary pokemon in this game than in the past, and ANOTHER REALLY GREAT THING IS there isn't any pokemon that require a gameshark to obtain!! even though they took away my 10 favorite pokemon...you should still buy this if you like the pokemon games"
4,Pokemon Sapphire+ Ruby Preview,"Another way to get into Pokemon! Pokemon Sapphire and Ruby will bring a whole new way to play. This time there will actually be 134 new Pokemon! Like in Crystal, you can become a boy or girl and start a Pokemon journey. There are a couple of bad parts too. One is that you cannot journey to the following regions; Kanto (from R,B,Y) Johto (from G,S,C) and the Orange Islands (not in any game). Another one is you cannot catch most of the R,B,Y,G,S,C Pokemon! But for the most part these games will be fantastic!"
5,My Second Favorite Pokemon Game,"This was my second favorite pokemon game and I have played it multiple times. I would recommend this to any pokemon fan! Loved the ""new"" pokemon for this version and a decent story line, especially if you add in a little of your own imagination!"
4,Pokemon Sapphire Version Review,I actually bought this game for my boyfriend who liked Pokemon way back when Game Boy Advance was big. He thought it was a nice idea and really enjoyed the game. It was a nice blast from the past.
4,Pokemon Sapphire,"I love pokemon. Great game. Alot of fun and very addicting. I just wish they would make a game like this for the bigger systems. One that you can actually go and catch pokemon like on the TV show. Until they get smart enough to do that, I will continue to have fun with what they have out."
2,Pokemon Sapphire,This product was a waste of my money as it did not work properly. It deleted my saved data all on its own. I am not happy about it.
4,Great,"It follows the basic gameplay elements as the earlier games, but it is packed with new pokemon, a new storyline, and well new everything. Can be a bit tedious at times but the hours of fun are worth it!"
4,uh....,"This is a very good game but it's missing something. I feel like they could have put more into this game, It's still worth the price but after you beat it it get's a little boring i think the pokemon emrald might be a little bit better it should have more pokemon. I beat it in a week i think. If you want a game that is hard and takes a long time to beat this game is probbley not for you. I would sugguest Super mario sunshin even thoe it is'nt for gameboy advance if you have a gamecube you should get that game."
4,BUY THIS,"This game is what anybody would ever want in a game. Action, advention, battle, and others, will be in this game. In the game, you start out as a boy or girl and you visit your neighbors in your new neighborhood. He is a boy or girl depending on who you are. Soon, you will receive a pokemon(Treeko, Mudkip, or Torchic), and after you receive a pokedex, which records the pokemon you see and catch, you will visit different towns, battle different trainers, and capture different exotic and rare pokemon. You can also go into pokemon contests if you get a Contest Pass from the contest center in Verdanturf Town. There is cute, cool, beauty, smart, ect. Each of your pokemon's moves has a different describing words(cute, cool, ect.). It can be very addicting and fun. Don't worry, even though the price might be a little high, it's worth it! BUY THIS"
5,Pokemon Sapphire,"I like this game a whole lot. Ever since I recieved it on christmas I've tried to beat this game and so far I'm close to winning the game. Now there are two things I don't like the game. First, that pokemon Kyogre that thing is hard to capture. Why doesn't anything work? I've tried everything I could catching it first, weaking it and catch 'em and use the poke' balls that should've given me an advantage.Now about the master ball whats the deal? Why do you have get all matches for your ID just to the ball? Can't you just get it from someone like Steven? You fix the game using my requests and you'll get more customers in no time."
5,Super great game,"That menhoven guy is full of it. Why is he writing reviews if it's so ""juvinile"" obviousley he's obsessed with pokemon.The cards are stupid but the games are great. I loved the first five games. But I only bought yellow and gold but i've beaten gold about 5 times so I was thinking they needed a new version. What I've read in the reviews on the sites from what I heard It will be the best yet. Alls I Knows is I'm gonna to get it."
5,Greatest Pokemon Game Ever!!!!!,"Trust me, you've got to get this game. I think that that the originals were fine and there graphics were lagging but sapphire has a great story and great graphics, the game is great because you are in the all new Hoenn Region and only 52 of the original pokemon were kept and the new pokemon are so cool, if you have any intrest in this interview you obviously are thinking about buying it, buy it! The game is the best, the features are the best, buy it!<br /><br />Sapphire rules all. Sapphire kicks the originals out of commission. Sapphire is definitely, a game that will be remembered as a great game."
4,Erik's review on pokemon Sapphire,Pokemon Sapphire is preety good because it's fun and it's very challenging for people of all ages. Overall this game is on my favourites list. It is one of the best games!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
2,Im so sorrry,"This is the saddest thing scince the release of Crystal,Silver,and gold i mean come on the card game lost it years ago really leave it to the sales if it buys well good if not dont just come up with new pokemon and cards if it starts to flop let it. i used to play the game and card game. its just sad that they keep the games and stuff. ohh my a new set of pokemon better graphics whoopedy dooooo just leave pokemon to flop"
1,Another Example of Nintendo Trying To Make Money,"Enough with the Pokemon stuff already. It's a fad that died out a few years ago, yet Nintendo's making a sequel with some of the most dated graphics I've ever seen. The series hopes to get young kids into the RPG genre, which is fine, but for them to keep at it this long is abseloutely pathetic. They should have scrapped this project and focused on the new Golden Sun game, an RPG series that's actualy GOOD and requires DEEP THOUGHT. I doubt anyone over 10 is playing pokemon anymore. But those who are should try to expand their intrests. Maybe try a ""T"" rated RPG and see how much more comlex and interesting it can be."
1,Two Thumbs Down,"First lets get things straight, I'm just trying to help and have nothing against Pokemon:The graphics are really bad for GBA.I would recommend for 10 and below but everyone older than that should get something like Golden Sun or Breath of Fire II.And Pokemon is just a bit too, err juvinile for the elder players."
4,Good But Gets boring..,I love this game but after you play it for a while it gets old. It's always the same thing but also exciting at times.
1,yeah!.....ahh!,let me first say that the game was in good condition and shipped quite fast but i looked online and did some research and found that the game i bought was fake or so what many youtube videos told me by the markings i found that werent there so i played the game anyway hoping for something and found it worked but the catch was that the game deleted my first save and when i tried to replay and go and save again it said that the internal battery was dry and couldnt save now i have messaged the seller and am trying to return it and the seller is CapnGames so i am wondering the credibility of this seller for the sake of other amazon shoppers i am telling this too.
5,Tis game is good i have codes for it Gameshark Sp codes,to get all lvl 100 pokemon type in 10937847264 to get mewtwo type in 728783493728 to get steelix 35848r883753 to get deoxys go to space on the pokemon rocket and kill donkey kong and rescue the fart heads just playin ummmmm the est code is ulimeted masterballas 34957386735847483759589547854795493ri4hr44933h483y38r8r8u38 type exactly beat the elite 400 and destroy fox and rescue kyogre.
4,Looks like a good game,"This game looks appealing. The graphics look near to Gold and Silver but there is also more to do. I am going to buy this game because it continues the pokemon story (I hope Geovannii retunes). Although the battles will be tedious, the 2 pokemon action will make up for it. Buy this game!"
5,Pokemon #1!!!!!!,"I have played every single version of Pokemon (Red, Blue, Silver, Gold, Ruby, Sapphire) and Ruby/Sapphire's the BEST!! The graphics are sooo cool! So is the gameplay! T'ts so awesome!! Another thing i like is that its so easy to get stuck in this game. Its more of an RPG like Final Fantasy. You have to figure out ways to do stuff! And there are so many side quests! Kyogre and Groudon are AWESOME!! So is Rayquaza!! omg! and uh if all of you out there that dont know what that is, go to Pacifidlog Town and surf outside the eastern part and go up and look for a cave door thingy. Enter the tower there, and get past the cracks with a Mach Bike and Rayquaza is at LVL 70!! but u can only get it after beating the elite four...oh well! so anyway its so good! Fly, ExtremeSpeed, Outrage, and Uhh I forgot last move, but oh well!! Anyway Keep on Gaming People! Oh and anyone who disses Pokemon (the game) is so stupid! Ive seen 14+ year olds play this game and say its awesome!!"
4,Good Buy,I purchased the game for my grandson. He says he is enjoying it very much and the price was great.As usual the product was delivered in a timely fashion.
4,very cool,i love my pokemon sapphire. it's a great game for people who have played pokemon before but if your a beginner i would get help from some online website. sadly you cannot trade with gold silver crystal red blue and yellow :-(. for once you actully fight the leader of the team your fighting ^__^! but i'll say it right now after youve betean the game it gets kind of boring. but boring or not its very cool :-)!!
4,I have caught all of the pokemon in 15 hours,"I completed the game in 15 hours, catching all 200 Pokemon. I have a Deoxys, Jirachi, Celebi, Mewtwo and Mew, but you can get these Pokemon by using only Action RePlay. This game is fun! RATE IT!"
3,Poopymon,"I'll cut to the chase.Goodies:New Pokemon.More updated-like.Better fighting.Baddies:All the classic all-time favorites such as charizard and mewtwo and been retired from this game.Dumb names and creatures. (who would think of mudkip? either a big fat party animal or a gay guy?)IQ dropped 10 points and gone to the 8 year olds.Cannot trade with other classic Pokemon games, so forget about your old favorites.I am very dissapointed... :("
4,The Craze is Back with Two New Games,"TIMELINEApril 4, 2003Purchased Pokemon Sapphire at local Toys R' UsApril 4, 2003Beats Gym Leader RoxanneApril 15, 2003Purchases Golden Sun: The Lost Age at local Toys R' Us. ( Not pertinent, but hey)April 15, 2003While eating ham sandwich, declares Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire are some of the best RPGs on the Game Boy Advance. With over 200 Pokemon to catch, eight tough gym leaders, the Elite Four, and rare Pokemon, these games are so fun you won't put them down for at least a few hours.Helpful Hint:You can capture the legendary Pokemon Kyogre or Groudon in the Cave of Origin."
4,THIS GAME ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I don't have this game yet but my cousins let me play theirs and i am getting it in 6 days!! By the way ,whoever wrote as ""a gamer""you're completely wrong!!This game would not dissapoint other costumers, it would just make them happy.Over all I reccomend this game to any pokefan!"
5,"Great,no,Exellent,no,THE BEST!!![...]","Saphire rules the game scene!That's what I think,I also think I'm the one you should come to for Pokemon Sapphire tips,I have the guide and am halfway to becoming a Pokemon Master.But first lets get things straight,there are more than 6 2 on 2 battles,there are limitless 2 on 2 battles.Also,although I haven't played any previous ""Pokegames"",I can say for you people who think Sapphire's ""horrible"" because it can't trade with old ""Pokegames"",get over it.Act like it's not in any specific series of games....I did.Also,people who think the game's ""childish"",I've seen peolple over 40 yrs. enjoy it,you just have no taste in video games.Lastly,people who think Saphphire's too hard,you just don't know how to plan strategies.Now more about the game,and not you tastless peolple. Uh oh,I'm about to be cut off,bye."
3,i am disappointed,"This pokemon game was good and all. But nintendo can't get rid of great pokemon like Charizard, Dragonite, Blastoise, etc. In my opinion Gold and Silver were the best versions. Since you could have all the pokemon up to 251 that's plenty to catch. Breeding wise off the start a person can catch five pidgey at level 2 with a Totodileand trade with another version where it's completed and have a team of a totodile, charmander, chicorita, dratini, larvitar, and someone else off the start. While ruby and sapphire some problems they're still good but if u are starting to play pokemon now get either Gold or Silver pokemon version."
3,Jugando con la Infidelidad,"Creo que Walter Riso ha llegado a un punto comodo en su vida personal y asi lo demustran sus ultimos libros. Un amor relajado, una vida apasible y no muchos cambios. Jugando con fuego es una obra interesante para leer con cuidado. Al igual que el tema de la infidelidad es para escribir con cuidado. Personalmente no soy muy amigo de los consejos pero debo reconocer que los de este libro pueden ser utilles y apropiados para ciertas relaciones. Para saber a que se juega y que se esta dispuesto a arriesgar para ganar o perder."
2,Not a technical referance,"I agree with the previous review. However, in my opinion the book is very very basic. If you had a ten year old who was interested in material science, this is the book for him. Just to, re-iterate there is ""ZERO"" technical information."
3,Meh.,"This book did have an interesting topic, something that initially caught my eye when I was looking for a good book to read. One usually finds more generic medieval eras as the setting, rather than the crusades specifically. However, when I began the book, I found it rather disappointing. The main characters were, in a word, flat. There was no real sense of being in the story, and I found a surplus of slightly clichéd supporting characters which was very disheartening, as the plot was fairly original, though still very easy to predict. While this particular work didn't live up to expectations, I do think the author is heading down the right path, and given more time and experience, could create some magnificant writings, though this book was not one."
1,can't view the dvd,"I love Johnny Hallyday and would love to be able to review this dvd. However, I did not realize that I would not be able to play it in my player and therefore, I can't review it. Bummer. Major bummer. I really wanted to watch this. Anyone know if there are copies formatted for North America that I can get?"
1,160 GB IDE Hard Drive,"I bought this product and it did not work at all. I plugged it into my main board and it sparked, smoked and did not work. Do not buy it!"
1,Review for Kindle Edition only,"There is no access to an index or a table of contents. There are 11480 ""locations"", i.e. Kindle pages. The ONLY way to go through this text on Kindle is page by page by page by page....it's use as a reference is greatly diminished because of this. Unless of course, one has nothing but time. I figure I may be able to finish it and submit a review on the actual contents sometime in 2047."
1,Disappointed,I thought this album would have more than 2 songs on it. I was quite disappointed with this album. I do like a lot of the Josh Pyke songs but not these two.
5,Excellence turned into Ecstasy,"I think this game is excellent in every way. Everything is top notch here. Although the camera is annoying, it doesn't really ruin anything. So you ask, what propels this game from being merely excellent to out-of-this-world?"
4,This is such a great game!,"I tell you never liked ""Zelda"" games, until now! I have to say the bosses a little work, but other wise this game is fantastic! The graphics are great, the story is great, everthing about this game is great!!!(except the bosses, but you already know that.) The only thing I want to say now is...This Game Rocks!!"
5,The best game for gamecube out now!,This is a excellent game!I was hooked on the game from begining to end (even though the begining could seem slow and boring) and I played in all of my spare time. At first I was disappointed with the graphics but you quiclkly get used to them and noticed them as normal. It has a very compelling storyline and even though I would perfer graphics with more of a realistic look I am still extremely satisfied with the overall content of thia game. You should buy it or at least rent it. It offers quality fun from begining to end.
4,Wow,this game is awsome it is 2 player if you have that gba hookup thing. you can use enemy wepons and everything you should get this
3,......What,"Okay I saw all the E3 crap and I'm like all wowed and stuff then BLAM Links got FRIGGIN tiny feet and a huge head. God I was expecting much better. Some of the dungeons were original, SOME. I kinda liked one boss and that was in a temple at the end of the game. IT MADE ME LAUGH. So I figured out that it also had a crappy story line. NOTHING compared to Ocarina of Time. Link was mature and the game had blood and gore pretty much. Now links sister gets caught by a fat bird with a fudging mask over its face. Dont even buy it. Buy it if you want to laugh."
3,good and bad.,"Many people got ticked off by the new island hopping system. I found this to be anoying as well. You don't really fight many enemies on the ocean, and you have to take the time to change the wind direction before you can get anywhere. This stops when you learn the cyclone teleportation tenchique, but that's not all that sucks about this game! After you play through all the dungeons, you have to sail across the ocean, complete all these stupid puzzles, and get these seven charts. Then you've got to somehow find Tingle Island and get them deciphered. Then you have to salvage for all these stupid Triforce pieces! It takes so long to do that, I still haven't gotten past this long part. The bosses look cool and are pretty fun to fight, plus the dungeons are somewhat enjoyable, but the spaces inbetween the dungeons are just to boring. Buy this game if you love zelda games, but otherwise let it slip."
1,Why the cartoonish graphics!,"I had loved the Zelda series, but was dismayed when I saw Wind Waker. The cartoonish graphics look childish and amateurish. I nonetheless decided to rent the game and give it a shot. However, I gave up after a half hour or so. It just wasn't fun and wasn't worth my time."
1,que juego tan malo,este juego es el peor de todos para los que han jugado todos los zeldas se podran dar cuenta que en la mayoria siempre pelea uno por 8 pendientes y que las 3 fuerzas estan en los castillos no en el mar hundidos este juego apesta
5,"The best game ever!! well, second best","This is the best, well second best, game ever!! The graphics are awesome, but they will take some getting uesd to. the gameplay is supurb, and the musical score is awesome. I would have given this game a better rating, but this is the highest they allow."
5,Outstanding,"Don't let the Cel-shaded look put you off, this is one of the best adventure games ever."
5,THOUGHT I DIED AND WENT TO HEAVEN!,"I have been playing video games ever since I was a young child (about Link's age in this game), and this is definitely one of the finest video games I've ever had the pleasure of playing.Every single aspect of this game exudes polish and quality, from the graphics to the storyline, controls, gameplay, dialogue, level design, music, etc.I really pity anyone who considers him/herself a serious gamer and has not picked this one up yet. I especially pity them if they're foolish enough to avoid this game because of the cell shading. The simple fact is that ALL Zelda games have had a cartoonish look (example: look at a Goron in OoT). This one just pulls it off with more class and charm than any of the previous ones.You really need to go buy this game right now.No, seriously... what are you still doing reading this review? I said GO BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!"
5,Great fun and Game,"Been wanting to replay this for a while. I had beaten it when it came out, and borrowed it from a friend. so i can now say i finally own it.Also playing each Zelda game chronologically is really fun.Thanks for the game"
5,another round of sweet nintendo goodness,"nintendo, yet again, proves that they dont know how to make a bad game. even if it using a very different style such as cel-shading, which even though its being used by everyone now, is still fairly new, they managed to make a world that is as much fun to look at as it is to play in. while seeming a little easier then Ocarina of time, and with an instrument thats not nearly as fun as an ocarina, its still a blast to play, im only 3 hours into it and its already right up there as one of my favorites. do yourself a favor, dont listen to those who think it [is bad] just because it looks like a cartoon, and go buy this game. at least rent it, then buy it. youll be so happy you did."
4,Great Game,This game is great. I love the graphics and the cartoon looks. It is not as bad you you might think. The controls are simalar to the ocorcrina of time. It is kind of hard to control Link but that is a minor problem. This game is very long. This is the best Zelda game ever!
5,"It's Zelda, That Tells It All","At first glance The Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker might look like it was made for 4:20. It took some time for my eyes and feelings to get adjusted to the graphics. I was never a great fan of cell-shading, but hey! It's Zelda. Putting the visuals aside. The Legend Of Zelda:WW is a game that can be fun but very frustrating. You will travel by by foot and boat while you traverse the lands once in order to stop the dark hoards of none other than, who else? For more go get the game it's worst it =P-CONZelda is a great game and I love everything but there is one thing that gets on my nerves. **??MIGHT BE SPOILER???**Don't Read On.Unlike any of the other Zelda games you actually have to save up a ton of rupees in order to progress."
5,Zelda is the best!!!![.]4 sure.,"Zelda is always gonna be the best game in the world.Windwaker is no exeption. I liked the cell shading. It was cool but the cartooniness of it turned me off at first. But when u play it and look around u see that everything is perfect. The cartooniness of it made the graphics awesome. It looks super cool.The grass moves in the wind, Links hat wiggles around etc.If u like Zelda games get this one trust me u wont regret it.((-:"
5,Best game EVER,"This is literally my favorite game of all time. The play control is so intuitive. The graphic style is amazing. If someone told me that I had to pick one game to put in my Gamecube and never open it again or it would explode, I would pick The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. If you don't already own a Gamecube go buy one just so you can play this game."
3,"Fun, But Short","If there was ever a gam made for the graphics technology of the GameCube, it was the Zelda series with all its fantastic creatures, wizards, and monsters. On that level, the game does not disappoint. It is one beautiful game to play. While it is fun to look and play, it is not as deep as i would have liked. I played the game fairly regularly for a week and beat it in not time. There was not as much to explore as I had hoped or many challenges.If you love Zela, by all means, buy it. Personally, i think a casual fan ought to rent it first and gauge whether the challenges involved have any replay value. i, for one, do not think so. But the game is still well worth playing at least once."
4,Best game ever!,"Zelda windwaker is a great game. I've never understood how the zelda series works, but then I got this game and it explained everything! This game is so much fun. You could get lost plaing all of the limitless sidequests. The fighting sistem is easy to get down, but hard to master. This game is worth every penny. I would buy it if it were $80!!"
4,The series contines!,"When I heard about a new Zelda game for Gamecube, I was thrilled. And this title exceeded my expectations. The new meathod of cell-shading complemented the fun gameplay and thrilling new cast. The story is basicly this: Link's sister gets kidnapped by a giant bird. Using the Wind Waker, which allows Link to change the direction the wind blows, he travels among fifty islands in his boat, The King of Red Lions, to rescue her. He meets and befriends many characters, including Tetra, Valoo, Medli, Makar, Miss Marie and many more. So if you are a Zelda fan, or are just looking for a fun game with many sidequests and adventures, The Wind Waker is a must-buy!"
4,Zelda,I am sorry to say to all of you who said the n64 games were the best but the truth is the very first one was the best. The graphics are not that good but anyone who has pplayed should agree. Just to tell everyone usaully sequals are not as good!!!
5,Zelda : The Wind Waker,"Ok , I got this game the first day it came out along with the remake of ocarina of time for the gamecube.I played OOT for awhile but the graphics made me wanna kill myself so i started playing wind waker. I played it for about 2 weeks straight and got pretty far , and really enjoyed the game . Then i got new games and played them and forgot about zelda for about a month. Then i started playing it again and forgot about it. I havent played it in like 1.5 months but i really like the game and im gonna start playing it again hopefully right after im finished with this.The game deserves a 5 out of 5 , the graphics are amazing and so far the gameplay is sick .Thanks :)"
5,The Best Game EVER!!!,Okay people listen up this game is the best game ever the graphics are different but hello its called technology. The nice thing is there isnt alot of blood and guts when monsters die they just poof into a puff of smoke. This is also not just mindless slaughter it is for the good of your sister and the world of Hyrule which is underground the game will explain. there are tons of cool characters and a talking boat. somethings are realy realistic and some are not so realistic. The water is so cool. Stuff blows in the wind and you can cut very realistic grass so listen up all you people with skulls to thick to apperciate these realy cool graphics if you dont like them close your eyes and then play the game lets see how far you get trying to play like that. all in all this is the best game I have ever played!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,disappointing,"I just received this game yesterday night, and I didnt really like it. It was boring after playing it for an hour or so. I think Mario would be better than this, but then again..I have my own opinions. I got the collector's edition zelda..And i didnt like n e of the games.....they just seemed sort of boring....but i have my opinions and u have yours.... I would recommend bomberman generation as a great game for all ages!"
5,One of the best zeldas out there!,"Anyone who thinks this looks like a cartoon is blind!this looks more 3-d than cartoon!this is one of my favorite games on the gamecube!they should have make a sequel of majoras mask and went realistic,but dont get me wrong this is a great game!this is one of the reasons i bought my gamecube!i pre-ordered it and got the bonus disc free and i have already beaten the game twice!the windwaker is very addictive and is very fun to play thats why i give it 5 stars!"
4,"Good game, too short.","It's an awesome game. Very well-made and designed, but it's just too short. A very good game for Nintendo though."
4,Decent,Hey the games good but people are just a little suprized y its cel-damaged?I have to Admite people dont like the game because the Cel-Graphics. I really dont understand why its cel damaged but trust me this THEY! DID! THIS! ON! PURPOSE!Just because the graphics are Cel Damaged (Cartoon Animated) doesnt mean the games bad or any other ways.If you still dont get the point can U make a better game?Yes: Tsh ya right. (If yours do have a higher rating then you should be a freak of the game)No: I guess Some people can get this rightFuns and Goodies: Well the games battle system is fun and great(The games kinda short).But you will need to do something about something after your done with the game.Cons:1.Cel Damaged (ill kinda have to agree)2.Kinda short.3.You gotta backtrack alot.
3,Doesn't live up to Zelda legacy,"Pro:- Graphics(could use more detail in certain spots)- Soundtrack- Control- characters- most gadgets- Good dungeon designCons:- Difficulty -1 star(imagine Madden only shipping with a rookie mode)- Length/Pace - You do a lot of nothing. Overall gameplay is on the short side.- Story - not fleshed out- Mechanics - Long WW animations kill certain parts.Overall the difficulty REALLY hurts the game, but a shortage of dungeons and non-optional fetch quests also are a pain. I find sailing kind of fun, but it's obvious that it was pushed on us to pad the length. If they would of put in difficulty settings and added a couple of dungeons(I heard two were cut, worst move ever) the other flaws would of been much more bearable."
5,Best game I have ever played,"The Wind Waker is a phenomenal game. Strangely, it is the true sequal to Oot, which has been named the greatest game of all time, yet it is better than Ocarina. I have never played a game this fun and deep, and yes people it is better than Metroid Prime, Oot, Halo, Perfect Dark, GTA3, Eternal Darkness, and other recent critically acclaimed games. Click ""buy"" as fast as you can, because you will regret it if you don't."
5,Best Zelda game ever,"Graphics are really good,environments are very big,gameplay is fun and if anyone complains then they are not a true Zelda fan."
3,The first time through is awsome but it's all downhill after,"I played through the game once, and it was incredibly addicting. I started the second time through cause you get a cool bonus (pointless, but cool). After that I had to force myself to sit through it. The whole ocean thing is kinda cool I guess, but it's gets incredibly boring until later on in the game when you get a warp song for your magic stick, or baton, same thing. I'd rent it for five or so days just to beat it instead of buying it. Go to Blockbuster, five bucks for five days, best deal. The reason it gets boring is because in the end you have to collect these maps. Then to get them translated it cost you 398 rupees, and you need to go looking around the whole ocean place to find a fairie that gives you a bigger wallet. You have to do that EIGHT TIMES!!!! Oh well, I gotta go, peace."
4,Zelda is back in action!,"This is a really good game.To me no GameCube collection is complete without it.This is my first Zelda game and I've already come to love the whole Link adventure thing a lot!The whole game starts out in a peaceful little island then...boom!You save a pirate girl,your little sister is kidnapped by a giant bird,and you are thrown into an evil fortress!Did I leave anything out?In other words:YOU HAVE TO GET IT!"
5,BEST ZELDA GAME,I own this game and beat it so trust me... THIS IS A AWESOME GAME!you get to sail to many islands lokking for your sister. the grahics are cool (the smoke of a bomb after it explodes!) the controls are easy when you get the hang with it. RATE:A+++++
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I decided to pick this game up, but was disappointed. I was expecting alittle more action death coolness, but it wasn't there. It was pretty little link prancing around with a little dagger ""getting the bad guys."" If your over 11 years old i wouldn't even bother. Though the fact that it is link with a sword, and a well made battle mode i give it 2/2 stars"
2,Close but no Zelda,"This game is cool only because ""Zelda"" is included in the title.What a major dissapointment. I, like everyone else after playing the N 64 versions, had great expectations for this one. I set myself up for a big let down. The game is boring and too easy. The graphics are the only thing I like. It seems to me that theymade this game for 4-year olds. Maybe I'm getting too old for games. -(18)"
2,Sailing is not fun,this game is fun it has some good parts to the game. But it also has alot of bad parts the sailing is to long also the cartoon graphics make the water look dumb. So you have to look at bad water for the whole game. Also the game is to short
2,Why did they kill Link?,"Alright, let me start off by saying that I absolutely loved Ocarina of Time. It was one of the best games I have ever played. But what happened here? Its like a wanna be paper Mario, or something. The new graphics all the magazines claim are ""revalutionary"" are really really sad. The puzzles and stuff in Wind Waker borrow too much from OOT. They basically took the old ones and stuck them here in the hopes that noone would notice they are the same. The fighting is all right, but it wasn't as satisfying as previous titles.Overall, its not that bad of a game. Its zelda, so its got to have some value. However, it just wasn't the old run around with Link and kick butt feeling. It was more of a ride a boat with a geek and hit people with a stick feeling. Rent it, don't buy it. That's my final advice."
1,Worst Zelda Ever,This game is the worst. It is horrible sailing from place to place for the first half of the game. It is way too comic bookey. It doesn't hold a candle to oncrina of time.
1,Not into Zelda really. not that good,Zelda games arent as good as they used to be. This game dosent seem to look that good really. I think this should be the last Zelda game.
1,It stinks,"I hate this game. It looks like a cartoon and is just stupid. And for the ones who like this game I have played it. The Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask were the best games that Nintendo will ever make. I am now not a Nintendo player. You really shouldn't buy this game. There may be more people who like it but this is definitly where the Zelda series went wrong.Don't listen to those people who write good reviews, they are wrong. You will be disapointed."
1,Borring!,This game is lousy! the gariphics are very fake and boring! it isn't as good as the legend of zelda: the ocroinie of time. sorry for the spelling mistake. I hate tingle and he is in this game! Don't buy this game. Wait for the legend of zelda: A hero reborn.
2,Disappointing,"I played Ocarina of Time quite a while after it first came out, and it was the funnest, and most challenging, game I had ever played. So when I heard of Zelda: The Wind Waker, I was excited beyond all belief.So, I rented it (thank God I didn't buy it,) and it was really a let down. The graphics were alright, but not nearly as captivating as OOT, and the storyline was unoriginal. My biggest gripe was the sailing. It was way too time-consuming; I could actually just point the stupid boat and get up and do something else. I finally realized: there are so many better things I could be doing with my time.I don't recommend this game, unless you just don't care because it is Zelda. Why Nintendo changed what was already a huge success so drastically is beyond me."
2,worst zelda game of all time,This is the worst zelda game of all time for all nintendo systems. It just doesn't have the charm of the other zelda games. It gets really old and tedious spending all that time sailing across an ocean. Somehow sailing across an ocean and Link just don't match up. It doesn't stand the test of time like the other zelda's. I played through all zelda games all the way through. Here's my favorite zelda games in order.........1. Link To The Past - snes2. Ocarina of Time - N643. Legend of Zelda - nintendo4. Majora's Mask - N645. Legend of Zelda 2 - nintendo6. Windwaker - gamecubeSorry folks nintendo got it wrong with windwaker. Hopefully they'll redeem the magic of zelda with twilight princess.
2,Couldn't believe it,"There was a lot of anticipation for this game in my house. Having the two ""64"" versions made it so.I could not have been more disappointed. I was aware of the change in character look but nothing was even remotely as challenging as the ""64"" versions.The ""hints"" booklet left a lot to be desired in terms of actual information, so it DID take longer to do some things. The fact that you must constantly be going from one place in the sea to another for one little thing is a bit annoying. It truly gets you nothing.I was hoping this game would redeem Nintendo for not being very forthcoming with games....NOT!"
4,Possibly one of the best zelda's ever!!,"I got this game a few months ago and I was easily satisfied. Like most Zelda games this one really rocked.The new graphics express more of Link's emotions and are incredible. Link is looking for his little sister who was kidnapped and has to go through challenging dungeons, collect a piece of the triforce, and revive the Master Sword! I have to recommend this game hands down. This is one of my favorite games ever. I've beaten it so I won't spoil anything but you have to by this game. this game deserves this :)"
5,A True Zelda Game!,"I have set a layout here of the whole game and gave each feature a rating along with a reason why.Graphics:10/10-Who cares if it's cel-shade? I know I don't This game is a gr8 adventure alone!Music:10/10-No more of those anoyying beeps for music. A full orchestra plays all the new and classic hits.Plot:10/10-The story is set almost 100 years in the future from 'Ocarina of Time' and everyone's favorite baddie is back. Yup, Ganon. He also has new minions with him.OVERALL: 15/10-This game exceeds what every fan of the game series was looking for. It's definately one to become a classic.P.S. Someone needs to make a 'Zelda' movie!"
4,"best zelda game yet, a must buy for all ages","The first 10-15 mins. of the game bored me but the rest is godly. The cartoon animations don't make this game bad at all. i like the way you can string together combos to beat your opponents and variety of items is good. the story is very good and keeps the player hypnotized; I played 5 hours until my mom told me to quit. I still wanted to play. The only reason I didn't give the game 5 stars was because sometimes I had to look at the walkthrough because i was stuck. for example, in the dungeon with lava, i woulnd't hae poured a pot of water in lava. In real life the water would have had no chance, but in the game the water makes the lava hard so you can easilly pass through it. Get the game if you can find it at a great price. A must have for all gamecube owners."
5,"Great game, easy on the eyes.","I had this game when it came out and then had it scratched up by my younger brother. I recently purchased it again so just relive the game and I have to say this is a great game. The previous Zelda games for the N64 were a bit more difficult and probably not for inexperienced gamers but Wind Waker is great for the younger new gamers looking for to play an adventure/action game. The graphics weren't what I expected from the Zelda people but it's really easy on the eyes and younger gamers may appreciate that. I have to say, the N64 Zelda games were pretty scary, my brother couldn't stand to watch me play them but this game is great, he even plays it now. All in all, great game for a more casual gamer or to relax from the super graphics of the other Zelda games."
4,The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Review,"The Legend of Zelda the Wind Waker. I'd have to say that this is one of the best video games EVER. It stays true to the Legend of Zelda series, so hardcores like me won't be dissapointed. The game takes place some 300 years after Ocarina of Time. Now, Hyrule is just a big ocean with many islands. The Hero of Time ( Link ) is everyone's hero. The Wind Waker is a great game with many places to explore and LOTS of things to find. The only problem is the graphics, which knock the game down from a 5 to a 4. The graphics make Link look like a pansy little girl, not qalified to save the world from darkness.Overall, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker is a great game EVERY Gamecube owner should have."
5,comon cartoon looks cool,it haves very smooth Graphics but once you get into the game youll forget about the Graphics! becuse this game is 100000% amazing trust me you can't go wrong when buying this.a must buy!
4,The Legend of Zelda:The Windwaker,THis game is totally awesome.A must for all zelda fans. I think the new cell shaded graphics are really cool and add a nice tuoch to the game and the story line is really cool. One bad thing is in the beginning it takes forever to get from one island to another. Over all this game was great.Great fight scenes and many different items.
4,Yes and no...,"I have been a Zelda fan since the very first one came out when I was a boy. I would have to call myself a Zelda ""purist"" in regard to I believe it was a mistake to make this game cartoony and childlike. Don't get me wrong I liked playing parts of it and the storyline is a good sequel to Ocarina however I would have loved to play a more adult version of the game. This is Gamecube not NES, you would think they would try a different angle and use some of that impressive 3d graphics used on games like Resident Evil or Eternal Darkness. Hopefully in the future they will make a game for those of us who are grown up now. I guess I will just wait and see."
2,Can somebody say OVERRATED?,"Before you skip this review just because ""I don't like the graphics"", let me tell you my smallest gripe with the Legend of Zelda: The Wind waker is the graphics.First of all, the gameplay is similar to Ocarina of Time, and it could've stayed the same way. But no, Nintendo had to switch to this new ""stealth"" crap. Now, before you get all exicted that ""Zelda's going to play like Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell!"", let me tell you a little something: It doesn't. Instead, I'm treated to sitting in a barrel next to a guard that will sometimes stop for no reason to sniff his spear and waiting for hours on end to get to the end of a 3-foot area of land. BO-RING.The bottom line is, WW just isn't as fun as it should be. Next time, Nintendo should get the hint and go back to OoT style. If they don't, there's one less Zelda fan."
4,Is this a new trend?,"I loved many things about LoZ:WW, but I am sorry to say that I am somewhat worried too. It seems that many new games for the Game Cube are much shorter than they should be. They are too easy to beat, and Nintendo knows this. They think that players will enjoy sprinting throught the game and continue to play the ""mini-games"" which, despite their addictive nature, are secondary on my mind. I want a meaty game that is hard to beat and an accomplishment rather than a blink of the eye.I wondered about the size of the Game Cube disks before, now I think they have lost much in this new system."
4,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker for GameCube,"While the cell-shading (cartoonish graphics) has discouraged some Zelda fans from purchasing this game, you truly have to play it to appreciate it. Th graphics on this game are unbelievable. And very realistic as well (Link will actually drip dry for short period after leaving the water.)The storyline is very well thought out and the land had a history that ties back to ancient Hyrule.The ability to sail the seas is a great concept. However, later in the game, it seems to be time-consuming and kind of boring (...running laps in Hyrule Field...) Once you obtain the melody, Ballad of Gales, the amount of time spent sailing is greatly decreased.My only complaint about this game is the short life-span. I spent a total of about 8 hours playing this game only to realize that I had finished it. I ended up going online for a walk-through to make sure that I had actually finished it. A great game, but it could have been longer."
4,Zelda Windwaker,"This game really lives up to the status of the past Zeldas. However the storyline is different. This time it takes place in a totally different time where Hyrule was overcome by Ganon after Link died. In the game Hyrule is in a uh...different place, (I'm not saying where b/c then it would give the suspense away!)you have to beat this *uknown character* to save your sister after she gets kidnapped. One clarification, you are NOT Link. It is common on the character's island to dress accordingly when you reach a certain age. in the characters case, he is that age when his sister gets kidnapped. Overall great game though."
4,Zelda's back!,"When i first heard that the new Zelda was out a ran out and purchased a copy for myself.I sat down ,and played it for 6 hours straight,it was addictive ,fun and the gameplay was fantastic.Do not be put off by the graphics at first,you will soon relaise ,that the game is as good as it isbecause of the graphics.The storyline is very long and interesting,believe me it is a worthwhile investment ,it took me a couple of weeks to complete and i was playing for hours on end.you will not want to put it down.The only fault i found with it was there was no speech everything was in subtitles,yes the music was nice and cheery but i think they could have done better with that part.Anyway it hought the game was fantastic and i would definetly recommend it."
1,disappointed,"The product was no good, the game had multiple scratches and did not work in three different game systems. My 12 year old was very disapointed. We will never shop Amazon again"
1,I HATE WIND WAKER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Worst zelda game ever (apart from the CDI games)! Its sssssooooo kiddie and childish,and it embarrases me to play it because it makes me feel like im 5! The new graphics are very boring and bland. If you want a proper Zelda game, GET TWILIGHT PRINCESS!!!!! That game is so much better than **** like this!"
1,I hated this game!!,I had heard great things about this game! BUT...when I got it? I hated this game! All you do is walk around doing stupid things.You dont even jump.I am just glad I only rented it.......
1,Just another shovelware children's game,"Let's see; bad graphics: Check! Music I'm not into: Check! Too long and frustrating: Check! Good luck trying to beat this kid's game in the same week you get it, because this is much harder than the first. 0/999 quadrillion"
5,Magic!!,"THIS GAME IS PERFECTEverything gets a 5 out of 5. You may not think it but the graphics are amazing. GREAT game. Just like orcarina of time, but maybe even better"
3,It's kinda fun,"This game is fun in some ways: like the parts where you go and around and discover new islands and stuf, but it is NO WAY as good as the other zelda, the Legend of Time. If you want a game that's good for little kids, then get the other zelda. If you are older and are just looking for a good game, get Resident Evil or Splinter Cell or something."
5,great!,this is a wonderful and complex game do not pay attention to the screenshots they stink. the actual game WOW!!
3,10 cons on this game,"all the other zelda games where pretty cool you know and were pretty fun and took about 1-3 month without help or a book to beat it and stuff and i am going to tell you some cons on this one.1. the graphics could have been better.2. ""where are the hookable roofs""?3. ""2 short temples... you have got to be kidding me.""4. game took me 3 days to beat without help, book, or friends help5. the enemy is butter and you are the knife (meaning enemys are too easy)6. light arrow too cheap7. cant take pick-upable weapons through doors8. bettle man is soo anoying when he keeps saying ""Thank you!""9. no red, blue or any other color of tunic (just green)10! 2nd time through game is boaring"
4,The best game ever,"Hey, you just have to buy this game, i know that it hasn't even go to the market but this gives you enought time to start saving your money to buy this game, I know that the characters look a little childish but they said the same about the last Zelda so you know that Shigeru Miyamoto is not going to let us down.Start saving because this is a game you can't miss...By the way, I'm sure that this game will come with the Ocarina of time version so its going to be really worth the price."
2,Too cartoonlike...cel-shaded,"A long time ago when Zelda first came out, it was a lot fun. The graphics were really cheesy but still a good time. Now, the graphics are still cheesy but the game is terrible. There's nothing worse for a game when you can't speed up the conversation; and there's a lot of it in this game. It is one of the most frustrating games I've ever played. I think this is one game you should rent first before buying, because it really is frustrating."
1,"Fun, but DO NOT BUY!","The problem is in Earth Temple, If you save and quit, then start at the file you were at Earth Temple at, then YOUR DOOMED!!!!! There is no way to go in the first door!!!!!!So if you want that game SOOOO badly, then get Gameshark for GC, otherwise, avoid!"
5,WIND WAKER?!?!?!?!? Well...its got an OL'GRAMPS/KUNG-FOOER!!,"Wind wakers a renter-then-buyer type, definately. unless, of course,your a complete legend of zelda fan like me...K,heres the deal.this miget pirate girl who wants to hit on you lets you go with her&her crew 'cause a giant bird stole youre sister and saved in [the] ""Fairy Forest"". the wind wakers a silver wand which lets you pull/push the wind to N,S,E, or W.(north,south,east or west.)you need to do this to navigate you boat to the next island or dungane or whatever...."
3,"cute fun, but far from legendary","The Wind Waker is a charming, beautifully rendered game in some ways, but it doesn't live up to its lofty lineage. The first three Zelda games were probably the most epic and well-balanced gameplay experiences of their day. The Ocarina of Time was an absolute revelation - bigger and prettier than anything available in the day and redefining 3d action gameplay. While fun and nostalgic, the Wind Waker's action is simplistic and mild compared to, say, the latest Prince of Persia and Ninja Gaiden games. Its game world is downright miniscule and uninteresting compared to the fully realized worlds of, say, GTA, World of Warcraft, and Fable. For a series that has traditionally represented the state of the art, that's pretty disappointing."
3,Not the best but ok,"The Legend of Zelda the Wind Waker was a disapointment. I didn't mind the graphics, but it was way too short compared to Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask. The storyline was crap, it turn's out both you and Tetra are decendants of Link and Princess Zelda. There were good items and the sailing was alright,as far as the songs to play I liked the ocarina better. In my opinion I thought that they should continue after Majora's mask, instead of a newer story. You should just rent it and see if you like it before considering buying it."
5,Best game I've ever played,"I've been playing video games since the 1980s but this is my first Zelda game - and I see what the fuss is about. This game took 4 or 5 years to make, and it shows. The plot, play dynamics, graphics, music and combat are just about perfect. What really amazes me is the depth of the game. There's a main plot but a staggering number of side quests. When I play this game, I really feel like I'm in the presence of genius. Don't miss out on this one."
5,Zelda perfection,"I think it's ridiculous that so many people are bashing the game because of the fact that you do a lot of sailing throughout the game. If that's the only thing preventing you from giving this excellent game a 5-star rating, that's a dog on shame.I also believe that, even though Wind Waker is pretty easy overall, that's not enough reason to bash the game either. A game doesn't have to be incredibly difficult to be fun.The graphics, sound and everything else is what you'd expect from a classic Nintendo game. So please, don't be fooled into thinking the game is boring when it fact, the game is completely enjoyable from start to finish."
5,Short and to the point review.,"I'll make this as short and simple as possible as I can for such a great game. First of all, for those of you put off by the graphics, I would say get over it quick if you want to experience one of the best games ever made. Just trying to understand the amount of imagination in this game is mind-boggling. Everything fits perfectly in this world that Nintendo has created, and the game just keeps you going and going, and it keeps giving and giving. Just in the few hours I played, I feel like there is so much I am missing, which will make me come back again and again to search for every last treasure. If you don't buy it on Amazon, buy it somewhere...NOW!"
4,Great buy,"Quite a good buy, everything was in perfect condition, it was described perfectly. 4 Stars. No problems with the game so far, it was a great deal compared with some others. A Awesome purchase."
4,best zelda game ever!,"I loved the windwaker, ecpesialy the graphics. I think the story line was changed dramaticly though, being a small fan of the originals. I have never beaten the game but I have got into it and it is awsome. if you'er a zelda fan, buy this one."
3,A comparison of zelda games,"the gameplay is great and the added camera control feature is excellent.however, the cel shading doesnt exactly draw my attention. The overall effect of the game is good. again i cant stand the cel shading. But i guess that is the price you pay for the great graphics. I still think that ocarina of time is the aBsOlUtE BEST zelda game ever. alot of pros alot of cons alot better than majoras mask."
2,Can somebody say OVERRATED?,"Before you skip this review just because ""I don't like the graphics"", let me tell you my smallest gripe with the Legend of Zelda: The Wind waker is the graphics.First of all, the gameplay is similar to Ocarina of Time, and it could've stayed the same way. But no, Nintendo had to switch to this new ""stealth""...Now, before you get all exicted that ""Zelda's going to play like Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell!"", let me tell you a little something: It doesn't. Instead, I'm treated to sitting in a barrel next to a guard that will sometimes stop for no reason to sniff his spear and waiting for hours on end to get to the end of a 3-foot area of land. BO-RING.The bottom line is, WW just isn't as fun as it should be..."
2,Aaarrrrrrggggh!!!!,"This is actually,surprisingly,one of the worst games to come off the Nintendo production line for quite some time.Yes,the magazines love it,and loads of gamers love it,but this is only because of a)the hype and b)it's Zelda.Borrowing VERY heavily from Zelda:OOT, it comes off as it's retarded little brother,and though I have nothing against the graphics,I can't help but think how much better this would be with a revised storyline,more inventive and origional dungeons and bosses,and would be more appealing to the wider gaming world with more realistic graphics."
2,IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE GRAPHICS!,"Many writers seem to think that a reviewer's dislike of this game is based solely on the graphics, but this is only one of the many reasons I was so disappointed in Wind Waker. The entire mood of the game has gone from fantasy good-vs-evil to Saturday morning cartoon. In the previous games you are battling genuinely scary creatures (hair standing up on the back of my neck the first time I encountered the re-deads for example) and having to actually use a little brainpower to make your way through many places, instead of now having the whole process spelled out for you. We now battle cutesy enemies that vanish in a puff of Disney-esque smoke, play hide-and-seek with annoying kids, and collect butterfly necklaces. There's just no comparison. This game would be perfect for the gradeschool set who maybe haven't played the previous ones, but in the long run, I'll stick to the older games and hope there's more (better) Zelda planned for the future."
1,Very Bad,"I don't know about you guys but what made me love the Ocarina of Time was the intricate characters and the very well developed story, the music and graphics were a plus. But in Wind Waker the story is awful!!!!! (i can't emphasize that enough) the characters are childish and the graphics, oh my god!!! i felt like i was playing rugrats... Comparing the Link i see in Smash bros and the one in Wind waker it pains me, i don't know what Nintendo was thinking but i pray they won't make the same mistake in the next one."
1,What in the world?!,"Ugh, that is the most dumbest game! I loved Zelda: Ocarina of Tim and Majora's Mask. They looked great for the N64. But I was also baffled by the myster pick they showed in magazines. When this cartoon load ...came out, I screamed and hid under my bed. Link (the real one) was supposed to be in it. Not some bobble head little thing. The graphics where good, but I wanted Resident Evil looking Link and Ganondorf. Oh, Ganondork looks like he is 6000 years old, not hip and 30 like the older ones. The King of Red Dragons mouth was dubbed badly it looked dumb. STILL NO VOICE TALENT! I could understand why on the N64 they couldn't talk. But on the GCN, look at the other games! They talk! Why can't Link?! Oh and don't forget that bobble-head can't say a sentence. ..."
2,This game is stupid.,I got A Link To The Past and loved it but this game is just repetitivie and annoying.Most of the time youre in a sailboat and other times youre playing in dungeons.It is so unoriginal it misses everything that made A Link To The Past and Ocarina Of Time so great.Do not buy this game!
5,Wind Waker is Awesome!!!!!!,My Dad surprised me a month ago by giving me The Legend of Zelda The Wind Waker and its AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!! It has a great storyline awesome characters and all around one of the best games I've ever played. Totally buy it!
2,Good game with one major flaw,"First of all, I'm not under 13, I just don't have a password. second of all, i got this game after hearing some good reviews. I had never played a zelda game until i got this one. i actually thought that this game was pretty good. The graphics are ok, the gamepaly is great, and the levels are fantastic. there is only one problem with the game. in order to extend the length of the game, nintendo put in alot of filler material. There is so much filler material in the game that it ruins what could have been the best game in existence. The worst part is that the rest of the game is great, and the filler ruins it. if there was anyway to get around the filler, then i would not have given the game this low score, but unfortunatly there isn't. i just hope that nintendo, fixes this when they make the next zelda game. Note: if you would like some more detail on the good things about this game [...]"
3,Acceptable...barely,"I really liked some aspects of this game, but others are in my opinion really disappointing. Some small details are more realistic than in previous games, like how you can't hold nearly as many items at once, and how you can throw Deku sticks. But I think that the way the graphics are made really lowers the overall quality of the game, the way colors are put 'at median' to smooth performance, as well as the way Link's body is somewhat ill-proportioned. I really preferred the N64 games."
1,I wasted some money here...,Zelda ww is so boring i hate it. The graphics even my little kids didnt like em theyre for youngsters.
1,this game is just downright wrong in every way,"this game totally blows. You start out on an island and it's your BIRTHDAY! that my friend, is the most lame beginning in the history of mankind. Your sister gets kidnapped and very scared by a bird. Lemme repeat that. a bird. A freggin bird that was on like steroids or somdin because that is one fat bird. well the game goes on.... and on..... until your fed up and u wanna see the end. and POOF! Your in the end... or so you thought you actully get to start over. oh noo this time it's special. this time you get to have tadahhh INVISIBLE CLOTHS oh yes this is gonna put my eyes on the screen. I just don't get it. This is NOTHING like the lovely other zelda's with a story that makes sense, graphics that don't make me throw up every time I see something ""evil"", or link with an ocorina, not some lame baton that changes the wind. Whoever thought this up, must be on heavy... heavy... drugs."
1,This Game is stupid!!,The disc can be snapped apartIt is not educational and involves violenceIt is not fun at allIt is the dumbest game I ever played since Halo 2!
1,Wow they really did it this time.,They managed to absoutley ruin a game. This game is so terrible because of its graphics. Thats not the only thing either. The gameplay stinks too. I am judging this game after playing it and wow it makes you think how people can make such bad games. Link looks like a pre-schooler who found a sword and decided to journey. Im confused why games like these are made.
1,Too Cartoony,"It's not a bad game, but the graphics are really disappointing. It feels too much like a cartoon. It's fun, but not as engrossing as previous offerings. I enjoyed the musis as always with Zelda games and the gameplay is essentially the same as N64 Zelda games, so that's cool. The cel shading is great, but I know it's capable of so much more."
4,Very enjoyable!,I have been a fan of Zelda since the game first came out for the NES and I have been addicted to the series ever since. Wind Waker has been a very challenging game for me to play for I still have flashbacks to the original Zelda where play was more two demensional. The cartoonish graphics took a little getting used to and the challenges are fun (even if there is one that is quite aggravating to me).I am really enjoying this game.
4,"Beautiful Graphics, and that's all...","Well I rented it, because I didn't want to waste my money if I didn't enjoy the game. Like I said beautiful cartoon graphics, but the whole Zelda series just doesn't appeal to me. The controls I think are difficult to use. Overall I think if you're a Zelda fan you should buy it, but if not PASS!"
4,Gamecube ZELDA:WIND WAKER game= good,This is a new good Zelda game!I think its pretty darn good!The look has changed all the way and so has the gameplay but this is a good game for GC.Its not as good as some other Zelda adventures but still...I love it!Its a work of art!I liked the old cooler 3D graphics but still I love this game!Zelda fans:go get it now!You will like it!I sure did but it isnt really perfect but still excellent.
3,Awkward,"I liked this game for the first few hours, but eventually the awkward combat controls got in the way. I love the art style and the game was fun, but combat required too many buttons at once. Even doing things like crossing rope bridges was tedious at times.I can understand why this game was a big hit, but it's not my style."
3,Wierd... wierd.... childish.... not challenging...,"The Nintendo 64 probably could have supported this game, both sound- and graphics-wise. It is moderately enjoyable at times, and the sailing is a nice touch, but it did kind of feel like an Ocarina Of Time sequel.I'm not saying that this is not a decent game, it is, but it lacks challenge and the only reason you NEED the strategy guide is because it would take you forever to find all the stuff you need due to the vastness of the world that this is set in.That is about the only thing that requires the power of the Gamecube vice the N64."
1,so bad i wanted to screw a donkey,i am pimp daddy king of all that's good and nasty!this game sucked i barely see the point of this game. o u rescue your sister whoop de freaken do. i would'nt rescue my own sister[i'm just kidding about that i think] the graphics are awful like construction paper. DO NOT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TRY THIS GAME.
1,This is NOT Legend of Zelda quality,"Do you remember how awesome the Ocraina of Time was? If you were hoping this game would be another great continuation of this story, you will probably be very disapointed. Instead of the great elf-like Link in the Ocraina of Time, his head now precicely mimics the demensions of a balloon. And while they claim that Link is 12 years old in this game, he looks more like 6. I don't think that The Legend of Zelda was ever supposed to look ""goofy"" like this. Even though the gameplay is similar to Ocraina of Time, the look of the game makes it just not fun. I DONT recomend it."
1,amazingly horrific,i have played the demo of this game at EB and wow what a shocker. this is one of the worst games i have ever played i would have to say. first of all cel-shading doesnt go with zelda. second of all everybody wants it because of gameplay when the gameplay makes a stench like no other. it could have been backed up by good solid graphics but they are nowhere to be found. my advice is play this game before buying. it is not a game for everyone or for all of the past zelda game players.
2,a 15 year old gamer,"I Want to no what where they think when they came up with the graphics for this game, I love Zelda games, any games with Zelda characters like the Super Smash Games, but what is with the baby face graphics. I am really thinking about not buying this game over the graphics. Why couldnt they just go back to the ones they used on N64 if the couldnt make them better. I also heard from another gamer that they could of make the graphics better but they deicide to use these. I dont care what the plot is, the point is this game's graphics are the worst."
3,okay for a zelda game,i bought this game when it first came out because i am a huge fan of the zelda series. i can't say that i was that impressed with it after playing ocarina of time. the game gets a little tedious with all the traveling (even after getting the warps). it's still a fun play but make sure you have plenty of time on your hands! i didn't think it was the best game in the series but it was fun compared to most games.
5,The Legend of Zelda re-awakened!!!,"The Legend of Zelda: the Wind Waker is set 100 years ahead in time than Ocarina of time. Nintendo has created a brand new style of playing, with a unique graphics design. This is probably Nintendo's greatest Zelda yet. It is challenging for old players, and yet easy for newer players to the genre. Link, the main character uses his talking boat, the King of Red Lions to sain across the Great Sea. The storyline is innovative, funny, and sometimes touching. All in all, this game has something for everyone in the family. You probably won't put it down!"
2,monotonous,"essentially, this is dull and overlong and you keep on wondering when it will come to an end; the main problem is not so much the arrangements, which ARE dull, but also the fact that there are no good songs or melodies here to speak of, and it's a drag that summer breathes 90% of the vocals here, instead of singing with that powerhouse voice of hers; well, ok, 'prelude to love' is interesting and its segue, 'could it be magic' is engaging"
5,Hot Stuff!!! :),"Why I didn't purchase this when it first came out,I'll never know! This is probably one of Donna's stongest albums that she has recorded.From ""Try Me...to Come With Me""each song has a wonderful sound and just fun to dance to.I have almost every one of her albums/CD's. Just waiting for her to put something new out! I did purchase the CD single ""I Got Your Love"" and was very pleased.Thank you,Donna,for all the wonderful dance music you've contributed to the music scene and has been a part of my life for all these years! I love to love you baby! :) If you don't have this CD,purchase it! It's great!"
4,"The Ever Important ""Sophmore"" Album","As 2nd albums are called this ""sophmore"" effort showed that Donna was far from a ""flash-in-the-pan"" Disco Star who would come and go quickly. When your first big hit is a novelty sound such as Love To Love You Baby, many wonder if you can move on from that.Donna continued to move forward with Love Trilogy, yet the album contained more of an erotic undercurrent than her first domestic release. On the LTLYB album, side 2 portrayed a more diverse side of Donna where on this release side 2 continued with the sensual side of things. Her steamy reworking of Could It Be Magic (much steamier than the live read that she does today), and the tracks Wasted, and Come With Me feed into her developing image as a Disco Sex Kitten.This album gave Donna her second gold single (Try Me, I Know We Can Make It), and her second gold album.I would have loved this release even more if more of Donna diverse talent was allowed to be exposed."
5,A Love Trilogy,"One of Miss Summer's early nice works. I really like especially,""Try me..."" which is over 17 minutes. All of the cuts are good, too.The CD itself is of superb quality. Disco music lovers must have this album."
5,Another Memorable Album!,"Like ""Love To Love You Baby"", ""A Love Trilogy"" has another 17-minute memorable song ""Try Me, I Know, We Can Make It"". The track is not as orgasmic as ""Love To Love You Baby"", but it is still enjoyable. If there were any doubts about her singing ability, it was put to rest by ""Could It Be Magic"" along with the one-minute prelude. That song was previously performed by none other than Barry Manilow!All Donna Summer fans should have this album. It may be hard to find it online, but you may be able to find it in a music store that specializes in Dance/ R & B."
1,Thoughtful,Harbison's songs are worth a listen. His piano quintet is also a remarkable piece. Performances are accurate and passionate.
5,It's About Time,"Finally a new Christmas Book for children featuring a female reindeer!Easy to read, no big words,and once your child starts it they won't put it down!"
4,Good basic intoduction,"I got some insight from this DVD that is not easily found. Once you become very familiar with the Afro-Brazilian patterns, you may think this DVD is rather basic, but when you are starting out, the information is very valuable. Fairly amateur producton values, but that's OK. It's the knowledge transfer that's important. Maria is cool and to the point. You are not spending a lot of money on this DVD, so I say it's a good value, especially when you are trying to get a handle on how to work all those seemingly exotic Afro-Brazilian patterns into something you can play your self on the kit."
1,I am extremely disappointed in this game!,"I am very annoyed at this game, simply because you can't play it! The ingredients slide right off and you're lucky if your kids can even get 3 toppings on before it tips. [.....]"
2,"You're Kidding, Right?","If you pre-heated the oven for your four year old, then gave her some dough, sauce, and mozzarella, she'd stand a better chance of making a pizza than by playing this impossible game. The toppings have to be perfectly balanced in order to stay on the way too slick surface of the crust. They need to be in the exact center of the playing surface, too, unless you simultaneously balance another piece at the opposite pole with the care of Indiana Jones at the very beginning of Raiders of the Lost Ark.One reviewer here recommended sanding the crust for better friction. That's an excellent idea, but should my kids' toys really require this of me? Isn't ""some assembly required"" scary enough without having to break out the belt sander?Average game time: three seconds. If you have any success at the ""advanced version"" of play, where you remove the base at the bottom of the chef, I heard you qualify for immediate employment with Cirque de Soliel."
2,Not fun anymore,"They must have changed the design of this toy because I played it 5 years ago as an occupational therapist and it was fantastic. We could get numerous pizza items to balance and my therapy kids loved it. I recently bought it for my own kids and every pizza item falls off. It's frustrating and my girls lost interest quickly, which I can't blame them. It's not fun to have the pizza tip after every turn. I will try and return this item."
1,Lousy toy,"Poppa's Pizza Pile UpThis game is well designed to frustrate anyone who plays it. It is almost impossible for an adult, much less a child, to balance the ingredients. The pizza very quickly falls off the figure's finger no matter how careful the players are. Sorry I bought it."
1,Horrible product,"A great concept, but horrible since the pieces slide right off. This was a gift, so at least I didn't spend my money on it! The game does not get played at our house but the pieces get used very frequently for sorting and kitchen play. So if you do have the game there is at least some good use for its pieces. I would strongly discourage people from purchasing this game. There are many other balancing type games out there."
1,so disappointed,It looked like it would be such a fun game. VERY DISAPPOINTING. It really isn't possible to get more than 2 or 3 pieces on the pizza (if that.)My 4 yr. old actually started crying and my 7 yr old was so frustrated. I don't understand why Int'l Playthings didn't figure this out before they put it on the shelf?!
3,OK game,"This game doesn't last very long. There are only so many pieces you can pile on the pizza before the game is over. No game lasts more than a few minutes. My 4 year old likes it, but it isn't worth buying."
1,very displeased,None of the toppings have a chance of staying on the pizza except the one that is placed directly in the middle. The pizza is way to tipsy for any fun at all and the toppings are made of hard plastic. Trying to think of a way to modify to use it...should just send it back.
4,GREAT FAMILY FUN!,"Our 5 year old daughter got this as a holiday gift. It's turned out to be a favorite game for the entire family and friends. It's a clever, fun, fast and creative game for the whole family. Even our 2 year old son loves it - however it changes the whole out come of the game. He stands back and just throws toppings at the wobbling pie but he's entertained for 15 or 20 minutes so that's worth a lot! We'd recommend this as a birthday gift to kids because it's unique and fun."
2,Very Difficult to Balance,We bought this for my 4 year old son and he became quickly frustrated with the game. The surface of the pizza is very slick thus not allowing any pieces to stay on top of it. It becomes quickly unbalanced if you do manage to keep any toppings on. Both my husband and I found it difficult as well. It looks and sounds wonderful but it wasn't a hit in our home.
3,fun but frustrating,It is a fun game but also frustrating. Almost too sensitive to what you put on the pizza. Most of the time it topples over after three pieces. Can be frustrating for kids because it is hard to advance -- even for adults :)
2,Mild Equal Plainly Nothing,"There is barely enough to use as a body cleanser. I don't like this product at all: left a residue, smelled, and didnt help at all. I went back to the same stuff I can get for a lot cheaper."
3,"Excellent ""Hammerklavier"" and very good Op.111, but...","I own the complete set of Beethoven sonatas by Goode and I have to say that he is significantly better at playing the early- and mid-period sonatas, at which he is probably the best pianist on record (though never perfect, unfortunately). He is not so good with the late sonatas, with the (large) exception of the Op.106 sonata, which he performs marvellously (one of the best of record), and the Op.111 sonata which is excellent too. He has been praised for his Op.101 and Op.110 sonatas, too, I believe, but I distinctly prefer Brendel for those and the Op.109. Although, I have yet to hear recordings of those works which come close to my idea of perfection.I would strongly recommend buying the complete set of sonatas by Richard Goode, but I do not believe he is that brilliant for the 'late' ones."
2,A Weak Documentary,"I rented this because I've been to Ostia in Italy and have walked around the ancient apartments, and couldn't resist a documentary about the subject. It seems to me that only someone who is interested in ancient apartment buildings would buy this DVD, but there is really very little about Ostia or its apartments. There's a lot about modern apartments, health clubs, fire departments, but the ancient buildings themselves are on screen for only a few minutes and very little of interest is said about them. For me it was a waste of money. Terry Jones has a better show about ancient Rome, where he actually walks around an ancient apartment building and discusses what life there was really like."
5,Nice Bible Study --- Just what I was looking for !,"This Bible Study is just what I have been looking for!! ---- I wanted a Bible Study workbook that focused on FACTS from the Bible (as well as ""meaning"") --- this book fits the bill! I have only had the book a short while, but can say that I am already impressed with the style and form of the information presented. I especially appreciate the questions that call for factual responses --- (there are also questions regarding personal ""use"" of the information). ---- Good workbook with lots of information presented clearly --- I will be buying more books in this series! Recommend !"
5,Vade mecum of card players,"A lot of people think they hate cards. They haven't read this book. Written by an acknowledged expert of card games, card tricks, and detection of cheating, the book starts out with a priceless explanation of how card sharks cheat, and how to spot it. His advice is always to just get up and get out when cheating is suspected. He then explains how to play poker, gin, pinochle, blackjack, and many others, with great advice on how to win within the rules. There are plenty of ""complete Hoyle"" type books with lists of rules, but this one goes them one-up with the priceless savvy it gives you about the real world."
4,Great book for gamblers,"I loved this book as a teenager and recently reread it. Scarne gives a good overview of gambling strategy and mathematics, plus some info on looking out for cheaters. His style is great too and a trip back to the cool 50s and 60s."
5,"Colorfully written, detailed guide to mountain biking in CA.","I look for three things in guidebooks. 1. Advice that won't get me lost. 2. Information on stuff I didn't know about before. 3. A sign of wit or humor. All of these matter, and I'm happy to say they're all abundantly presented in this book. Compared to a lot of the regional mt. biking books, this one is superior. The trail directions are clear, the histories & backgrounds are enlightening, and best of all, it's not boring or geeky. The maps are good too; unlike other books, they have a new map for each new route, instead of cramming three routes onto one dinky page. I also get the feeling that these authors worked a little harder than a lot of guidebook writers, who seem to hit one area then try to milk four rides out of one trail. In contrast, this book seems to cover a vast area with a lot more discrimination. The rides I've done so far have been fun and easy to follow. What more can you ask?"
3,Overall good.,I gave this DVD 3 stars because there are only a few base yoga poses and each advancing level is a variation on the few basic poses you learn in the beginner section. Jennifer gives clear explanations and the calming tone of her voice makes working through the poses and lessons easy and enjoyable.The purpose of the DVD seems to be to introduce the viewer to different poses you can do on your own when you need to slow down after a long and stressful day. She advises in the DVD that you should hold the pose of your choice for (anywhere between) 5 breaths to 5 minutes. Depending on your choice of pose and your availablity of time.Some people may disagree with this format because the DVD itself is more of a visual guide than a program you follow along to the end.
5,Excellent Yin Yoga DVD,"I have used several yin yoga dvd's and I like this one the best. I like that there is a choice of levels. In the advanced level she goes through the positions rapidly which I prefer because I pause the dvd and hold the position for as long as I choose. The tutorial explains easily and clearly why yin yoga is different from yang yoga and how it works differently on the body. I have done yoga since I was a teenager and once I incorporated yin yoga into my workout just once a week, I felt the improvement. The benefits are cumulative, you will find that each week you will feel more and more improvements."
5,Still use it!!!,"I bought this video over two years ago and still use it on a regular basis. Yin yoga is good not only for your joints and connective tissues, but for your organs as well. Jennifer does a great job of explaining why this kind of yoga is critical for you to continue as you get older..."
3,"Pretty good instructional, not for practice","This video taught the poses, but you can't follow along and do the workout with her, because it is merely instructional. I like to put in the video and do my workout with the tape. I learned the poses and do them in my own time. It was only ok."
1,There's a reason it was so cheap - it's mostly crap.,"The one movie I managed to look at was totally lame, as the Stooges were in it for less than a few minutes. Disappointed."
1,YAWN!,"I love reading and enjoy most books, but when i was assigned Certain Death to read fo lit., i almost fell asleep. there are a billion swear words like the d-, b-, h-, and s- words. this book is rated r for language, scary events, and boredom!!!!!"
5,its really good,"no one should diss this album because its simply wut it is..a ""raw"" live recording. its presents maiden with a certain ""rawness"" that makes it great. it lacks some of the classics...but it carries many of the essentials. some of the recordings are even better than ""live after death"" which isnt really maiden @ their best anyway."
2,A Real Crappy Recording,"As the last reviewer said, there are some great songs on this CD, but the recording quality is really bad. If you want to hear Maiden live, get Live After Death. This CD is put to better use as a frisbee, however. I suspect that when vocalist Bruce Dickinson quit the band, the rest of Maiden decided to milk him for all he was worth to delay hiring a new singer. This album, along with the other live album released around the same time, A Real Live One, was the result. It's actually an insult to the fans to release a low quality recording like this, so don't waste your money on it."
3,An Energetic Live Album with Rockin' Metal Grooves!,"There once was a time when I would have rated this album as 5 stars, but I have fallen out of that stage of my life. I have to admit though, when I was in high school, and these albums came out, most folk at my high school probably couldn't have been paid to listen to these cds. That was in the 90s, and when pop music had fallen to new lows in quality. When I was a teen, Iron Maiden was a band that I could turn to that was a few notches better than what I was hearing on the local rock radio stations, which didn't want to have anything to do with heavy metal. Also, this is a good one to listen to in order to find the roots of metal, which did not use compression in their recording. Many of these songs are head banging classics, and in my opinion, they sound better on this album than they did on the albums themselves.The best tracks on this one are Hollowed By Thy Name, and Number of the Beast"
4,"Raw, Live and Loud....Maiden fans could not ask for more.","This release is not as bad as what the previous reviewers wrote. It has classic songs that every one remembers. Check it out, you should have no complaints."
2,A real dead one for sure,"The band sounds like they're just going through the motions most of the time. If I saw a video of this I'd half expect them to glance at their watches from time to time, wondering when they can wrap it up and go home. The sound quality is terrrible too, the bass is far too heavy and the treble is too piercing. The album does however contain a very good version of Sancutary. A Real Live One was much better than this."
1,wax remover,I received a notice that the delivery would be delayed and then a notice that the order was cancelledI was very unhappy as it is a great product / just AWFUL delevery!
4,PUNK AT IT'S FINEST,"Dude, Murder in a Foreign place is a classic. Then they throw in all kinds of other old songs and recording. I'm a man of few words. This album rocks. My favorite song is I Hate Hippies. It reminds me of Junior High in 1980-81 when the punks and hippies were at each others throats."
5,"great food, simple instructions, readily found ingredients",It's all in my headline. This is a treasure. Add it to your collection or give it away to someone just starting a cruelty free lifestyle.
1,Not an essential guidebook,"I bought this book based on the fantastic reviews it has received. So far, I have found the recipes to be uninspired, just simply boring. This may be a useful tool for those truly unfamiliar with vegetable-based cooking - who need a lot of help with cooking basics, but if you are already able to put together a vegan meal of any type, this book isn't for you.Her recurring ingredients include Sucanat, Ener-G egg replacer, and red wine/cooking sherry. None of these are in my pantry, and I am a vegan who loves to cook. Also, there are a LOT of potato recipes, in fact, there are a couple for which the ingredient list is nothing more than potatoes and garlic powder, or ""any favorite seasoning"". Your money would be better spent elsewhere, like on ""A Celebration of Wellness"" by James Levin, MD."
5,Excellent food!!,"There's a lot of wonderful information in this book, but the bottom line with a book about food is, how good's the food?!This book has a lot of original recipes as well as interesting and very tasty twists on some familiar ones.Usually, I buy a new cookbook and then actually use the ones I already have. This one is hard to put down. So far, we've enjoyed all the recipes we're tried and are coming back for seconds."
5,"lose weight, eat to your heart's contect, feel great!","wow, what a book. I never understood so many things about why I ate the way I did. For the first time, I understand how to get out of the junk food trap- pounds are dropping off, I'm having a blast with the recipes, and I'm beginning to look really good for the first time in years. People are asking me what I'm doing- did I have a face lift- did I go to a spa. I'm giving this book to all the people I love."
4,I truly love to cook,"I truly love to cook and was successful cooking recipes in the Joy of Cooking at age 10. I'm constantly searching for good ideas -- in magazines, books, and on TV. I've been working on ""evolving"" my approach to be more healthful, and found Kitchen In the Clouds to be a true inspiration! In addition to the easy and delicious recipes are wonderful words to raise your consciousness. Perhaps not for the jaded vegitarian, this book is definately nourishing for those cooks who know the most essential ingredient in every dish is love!"
4,too small for a man,"I looked at this in a store. It seems like a nice knife (with watertight compartment), but the handle is too small for the width of a man's hand. I'll be looking for a bigger one."
4,Jeep knife,"I bought this knife because I wanted something smaller than the normal 15"" survival knives. It's a little easier to carry around because it's small. I aluminum handle seems nice and sturdy."
2,Praying with the Orthodox Tradition,"It's OK, however it is somewhat awkward to use. The different sections for various prayers are too spread out among the pages and not indexed in any way. Cosequently, I haven't used it as much as I would have liked."
2,"Nice, but expensive",They are certainly nice prayers; but not special. You can find similar ones in breviary of any denomination. It's only a 76 pages pamphlet(not 101 pages as described) with several blank pages. There are no more than 200 words on each page. To sell it for 10 dollars is outrageous! You'd better donate your 10 dollars to charity. Or pay 10 more bucks buy a much better Prayer Book: The Jordanville Orthodox Prayer Book.
5,Great Buy!,"This is a wonderful machine. We didn't know that much about making cappuccinos. This machine makes it incredibly easy and impossible to mess up! I was a little put off by the cost, but the quality of the end product and the ease of use make it well worth the expense. The built in coffee grinder is also fantastic because you can use whole beans which ensures the freshest coffee with each cup."
2,"Good coffee, machine has some issues","In short, coffee is great but machine has some issues. I boought it a few weeks ago and the water warning light is on continuously (regardless of water level). Also, the amount of coffee for one or two cups is exactly the same and if you want to switch from steaming milk to making coffee again, you have to wait 5 minutes. Not very practical with a house of guests that want to taste the coffee. Hopefully this is just a problem with the machine I bought."
4,I love lattes,I am really happy with this espresso machine. holds a lot of coffee beans and 64oz water reservoir so you don't have to refill all the time. Only thing i don't like is the frother head is in 2 parts and they are hard to get on and hard to clean.
1,Weak coffee & no foam,"What a disappointmant! We have had many espresso coffee makers over the years and could always make great foam with them. Not this one. & Don't say we don't know how to make foam, as I said, any of the other machines from Starbucks to Saeco made great frothy light foam. & Someone wrote that we need to make sure we have lots of room for the foam expansion. What a crock!. We can't get 30% more when we try and make foam, so forget the idea that it will double or triple in volume.This is a truely awful machine. Worse, we paid full price about 8 months ago and have regretted it ever since."
1,Delonghi does not honor their warranty......,Be very careful dealing with delonghi....we are out 600.00 after buying their ice cream maker...very very hard co to deal with...they don't care what your opinion is either!
5,Pricey but WORTH EVERY PENNY,"Just got my machine and after a morning's use I rushed back to amazon to type my review. This is so much better regular coffee, so much better than Starbucks. Better than most of the coffee I had in Europe. This is as good as high-end Italian cafe coffee. I am so wired. It was very easy to set up and is so easy to use, but above all, the coffee that it produces is really really good. And strong, if you have it set to max strength. My productivity seems to have doubled now that I don't have to spend time making coffee. Now that I won't be visiting Starbucks I'll save the purchase price in lattes over the course of the year, and after that I figure we're in the black! Friends had avoided our house for fear of being served bad coffee-- now they are lining up to make excuses to drop by. You must buy one of these machines. It has CHANGED MY LIFE."
3,GOOD OLD MUSIC,"The mix is great but i dont advise spending any money to help eminem or 50 cent. i mean you gotta be kidding me...anybody could mix a good song with tupac and BIG together but somehow eminem manages to put in the most disgusting chorus conceivable. it really is bad...doesnt match the tone of the lyrics at all, and it is waaay too long a chorus for how annoying it is. eminem's song with tupac isnt that bad, and i dont disagree that he is a very good rapper. i just still cant believe he messed up that song with BIG that coulda been PHAT... and the 50 cent song is awful (by far the worst rapper of all time; his voice, his lyrics..all horrible). otherwise, the cd is a good mix of tupac's old material."
2,"Fan of his, but not this offering","2Pac was one of the most gifted poets the country has had, but this offering does not ring out to his talent and capture popularity to the masses."
4,2pac,"this is more of a greatest hits cd if anything, just with a few unreleased songs, best unreleased track is ""Ghost"" and best overall track is ""Death around the corner"""
3,Pac can not be ressurected,"This albumn is good and bad. There are some really good songs and really bad songs, the 5o cent and pac song called the realist niggaz is high tempo true pac stuff. the song Ghost is also very good and has bad lyrics and a nice bassline. The album is let down by tracks such as PANTHER POWER which is a poor song which is not catchy at all even though it delivers a strong message.This albumn is for dedicated strong 2pac fans who love everything and every song by the greatest rapper on earth 2pac shakur.I still recommend this album for true worldwide rap fans but 2pac can not be ressurected 2pac will live on 4 ever in our hearts and so will his music but the new stuff is not true pac material and will never be bigger than the man himself would have made it."
3,Good album but 50cent?,"Okay if Tupac had done a piece with 50cent we would of known he had sold out...... So Eminem why make him sell out? Everyone knows 50cent doesnt have the cred or skill to be on the same track yet alone same cd as tupac..... And using tupac on a diss track thats pettiful, other then those small complaints the album is decent enough and Eminem actually produced a couple decent beats!"
3,Could have been better,Why did they a let a white boy rookie produce Tupacs tracks? I dont ever wanna see this happen again. Hes messing up pacs reputation with those beats he should have kept for 50 cent. If Dr. Dre would have produced the pac tracks this album would have been a hole lot better.
4,Very good but....,"I Liked the CD. ""Runnin"" with Biggie was a good song, but I liked the first version better. ""Ghost"" was so tight!!! I couldn't believe that Eminem did that track. I gave the CD four stars because of one song ""Realest Ni****"". 50cent shouldn't have brought his beef on that song. It was very disrespectful and Spice 1 who was originally on the song should have been the one on that second verse. They replaced a real street intelligent rapper like Spice 1 and put a studio gangster like 50cent on it. I really didn't like that song at all. The beat to that song wasn't all that impressive either. If it wasn't for that one ear ache of a song, the CD would have gotten five stars from me. I love Tupac's music and I've been listening to him since ""Brenda's got a baby."" He forever be missed."
1,get over pac and get a job,"he got shot. he died. he ain't coming out with anything that could possibly be relevant. save your money and send it to me, i'll give you some old pac cassettes and tell you that they are the ""magic"" last words of the prophet pac, you can hear a pac like whispering in the background and every time you listen to it, the whisperings change."
2,Not Good,This cd was not good at all. There were more old songs on it then there were new ones. The songs sounded like they were like 15 years old. Please if another 2Pac cd comes out make it of new songs. I still am a good 2Pac fan though.
2,When will it end?,"Every year greedy producers like Suge Knight keep getting rich off of tupac's work and it just continues. They should have just stopped with the horrendous Better Days album. How is this an album? These songs have already been released countless times. The only reason I rated this album two stars because ""One Day at a Time"" is actually a new song that I've never heard before and it is a deep track. ""Ghost"" was good, but could have been better. Any real 2pac fans know that these constant unreleased albums that keep coming out every year are just crap because it's just recycled songs. It's not the real 2pac. Be real with yourself. Stop disrespecting the poor dead man and stop destroying his music. The legacy ended after the Makaveli album, and these 4 new albums (with the exception of Until the End of Time) were a sorry-ass attempt at more publicity for more money. If anyone has any shred of dignity, they would let the man rest in peace."
4,One of the best posthumous TuPac CDs,"Of all the CDs that have been released since TuPac died, this is probably the best one. Many tracks are solid, and Eminem and 50 have a pretty strong presence on the few songs they're on. Unlike a lot of the CDs put out after TuPac's death, this one seems a bit more true to his stuff in life. This isn't the best TuPac CD, definitely not. But it's solid, and a good addition to your CD case if you're a fan."
3,I HAD MOST OF THE SONGS BEFORE THIS ALBUM WAS RELEASED!,"This album has some songs that I agree are good and din't get as much as attention as they should have from previous albums, but I had all of them already. The only ones I didn't have were the previously unreleased songs which are: Ghost (4/5) a great song with awesonme beat, One Day at a Time (4.5/5) Eminem did a great job with this song and put it together perfectly, Runnin' (Dying to Live)(5/5) This song is the best song on the album and the others don't compare to this one, The Realist Killaz feat. 50 Cent (4.5/5) 50 Cent and 2pac are the best in the rap game and showed it with this song."
3,Not as Great As I Thought It would Be,I love TuPac - have for years - I WAITED and WAITED for this CD to be released after hearing the preview on AOL Music of the Biggie/2Pac song...I got it and it does have alot of great songs - but some of the new ones aren't all that.
5,IT IS THE BEST ALBUM I EVER HEARD!!!,I love this guy and I will never forget him and I will always love him. This is the best album I ever heard except his other albums. HE WILL BE ALWAYS ALIVE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,OFF THE HOOK,"yo why u hatin guys u give it 3 stars and say its old its not like its ganna be new DON'T BE A RETARD hes DEAD dead people dont make new songs for soundtrack did you expect him 2 walk out a grave and say HEREs some new stuff NO! and his name tupac because thats his real name most rappers use fake ones like curtis jaxon carnell haynes and jah rule he dont compare to him cUz jah rule suck everyone know that jahs a punk i fyou say your from the hood you would understand his albums better then most people he dont just talk about cars and ice hes REAL and ""who is this guy?"" have you been hiding under a rock and if you expected him to come back go buy a brain 50 is the new best rapper niether though not as good as pac or big hes good since now day rappers are fake punks ludacriss is also dope"
1,correction,"""runnin""'s not an unreleased song; it was released in '94. and ""secrets of war"" isn't either; it was released in 96' and then again in '99"
2,Recycled,Most of the songs on this CD are available on his previous albums. The new material is really subpar. Whomever was in charge of selecting the material did a poor job in grouping songs for this compilation. Seems to be more publicity for 50 cent and Eminem (who happen to be artists on Interscope). The song produced by Eminem has a horrible beat. The music tarnishes Pac's lyrics. Don't get this soundtrack. Youre better off buying his previous releases or his bootlegs.
2,Only for Fans,"If you love Tupac, you will like this CD. Musically, it's the typical sounds and style he's famous for. However, I've always had a problem with the support and idolizing of a man who lived a thug life and died a thug life. Sure, he tells it like it is, but to me doesn't deserve all of the respect and props he gets. We idolize the wrong people!"
4,Good..................BUY IT!,"This is a very good soundtrack,so buy it.Not all of the songs i liked,but most of them were off the hook.Some of you people are stupid sayin that 50 is tryin to extend the beef with ja.I'll fill ya in bout the realest killaz.Its an old old song made around the time when 50 made power of the dollar.So its not new.the track was simply made officially released.Wellz,anywayz,buy this cd.....you wont regret it.TOP 5=Ghost,One Day At A Time,Death Around The Corner,Runnin (Dying to Live),& The Realest Killaz."
3,Tupac ressurection review,"This tupac cd first of all has a great beat to it however once you start listening to it daily like everday it kind of gets boring so dont excpect to love every song on it, however the two songs that are the top best is starin through my rear view and dying to live so good that you love playing it everytime your in a blue mood."
3,Its Alright,"This album is a lot different then (Better Dayz) and Pac's other hit records, yet it brings back some old pac songs."
1,Proof?,"Ii there really that many ""slept on"" tracks by ANY artists to keep releasing this many albums after death? C'mon now."
1,WAS MADE ONLY TO EXPLOIT HIS NAME AND MAKE$$$,"This cd has alot of songs which most of his fans already have so why buy it?It was made only to make his mother and 50 cent,eminem more money.There are some new songs but they really suck.The people who knew him and are supposedly his friends are milking him for everything hes worth.He's been dead for eight years and yet more and more records are being made.First of all,he was a great rapper but I dont idolize him because he stood for many of the things which are wrong in this world.He hasnt changed the world like he said his message would."
1,Too many old songs,"This was simply nothing but a way to get your money. If you are a die hard 2 pac fan, you may have all of these songs already. I would recommend FORBIDDEN: THA ONLY CHILD."
3,If Pac was alive,"YEAH, YOU MAY HATE THIS REVIEW AND THE REVIEW HATES YOU!!!!He would have never made an album w/ eminem or had commercialized 50 cent backing him up on a cut. Expecially when he was beefin wid Dr. Dre till his death why would he hook up wid Em to do an album? Even though I give eminem his props as a rapper but dont really listen to him that much. Eminem worships tupac and trys to emullate his every move, style and motive ""HE AINT PAC"". However I'm glad 2pacs mom got the rights to his muzik but dissapointed she decided to let eminem produce those tracks that he did. To Rap It Up It is a good album (not pacs best) 2 have just doesent have the same feel as 2pacs classic albums! oh yeah ghost is the best new song on there!!! LET ME REMIND YOU JUST INCASE YOU DIDNT RELIZE IT, THIS REVIEW HATES ANYONE WHO HATES IT!!!! FCK YALL!"
1,A Total disgrace to tupac's memory,"Why would stupid rappers like feminem and 50 crap appear on this soundtrack, the late 2pac would have never shady/aftermath, and 50 claims ja is like pac, then why in the [...] is he doing realiest killas with him, I'm ashamed at afeni shakur for letting this garbage for new fans, 2Pac RIP You will always be remember for your realness and your emotion.This soundtrack is a disgrace.and if you think that was bad enough wait until Loyal to the game my review on that later"
4,solid album,"this album was good not great. The first 7 songs are really good, then i was not impressed with the selection of the rest except for the Realiest Killas (last song) which was a very hot track!!!"
5,Best rapper of all time,"Tupac can be said as the best rapper of all time without any controversy. Tremendous lyrics, phat beats and of course good features (Eminem, 50 Cent)wat makes this cd different is 4 unreleased tracks."
4,"Great SDTK to ""One"" of the Best","This is more of a documentary SDTK than anything else. But it is still good. Ghost is probably the best track on here. I am not that impress with the 50 Cent song or the Eminem track. They are not whack tracks, but they are not great either. Hardcore Pac fans like myself, this is a definite buy. Everyone else, you shoudl buy it and not download it.Top 3 Songs: Ghost, Runnin, Death Around The CornerBottom 3 Songs: One Day At a Time, Realest Killaz, Same SongSleeper; Bury Me A G"
3,Maybe 4 starz,"THis SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER, seriously, there were only a couple of good tracks. However those tracks almost make tha album worth it!nyce guest apperances though!R.I.P 2Pac!Lyrikai J$B"
1,quit phukking up pac's music,I hate this cd pac never knew eminem or 50 cent and would diss them if he was here as for running it features the outlawz when they were dramacydal and other dead homie stretch all their verses have been erased and did'nt add pac's verse from the song but took another pac song and you do the math.rest is classic material from 94-95 pass this right on by and get the bootlegs.
4,"tight Cd ""holler if ya hear me!!!""","A Cd that really show what 2Pac had to offer to the hiphop world. New stuff with some old stuff all mixed up together to form a masterpiece of hiphop music. some features include Biggie,50 Cent,Eminem, and the Outlawz. Some of the great songs include ""Runnin"" (featuring Biggie), ""Same Song"" Even though it's an old song it's still good. The song ""Realist Killaz"" (with 50 Cent) is one of my favs on the cd as well as ""Ghost"". 2Pac is what hiphop used to be about, making good songs and keeping it real. Today it just seems everyone just want to talk crap abbout each other and put chicks on their cd as features to make radio friendly hits. I understand wanting to make money but please.... The legend lives on through this CD enjoy...."
5,Legend.....,"Like Bruce is to martial arts....Elvis is to rock....so 2Pac is to Rap. Immortal and a Legend. Through this album...going through his career from early to later times...the emotion and passion id highly evident and damn strong...2Pac had a gift and talent to create music that made u feel pain, happiness, anger.The songs manage to encapsulate most of his feelings.""Runnin"" is a powerful song..Bigups to Em for this.Imagine if Pac and Big..sorted their issues out,and did a compilation 2gether!Imagine..R.I.P 2pac..The Greatest Ever!!!"
3,Mediocre...some good stuff,"A few tracks on this CD have the effect of one-hit singles, such as Runnin', Ghost, and Same Song. They have a good beat while other tracks such as Panther Power seem to be thrown together at the last minute."
2,Greedy people still enriching themselves off Pac's legacy,"To start off, I think the Resurrection movie was a good idea. I learned a lot of things about Pac that I hadn't previously learned. Now as for the soundtrack, I can't say the same. This soundtrack consists mostly of songs that have already been released. If you already have all of Pac's other albums then the only tracks on this soundtrack that are worth hearing are Runnin', Ghost, and Realest Killaz. Overall the album just shows how desperate Death Row is for money and is still extorting Pac.I recommend this album if you don't have Pac's other albums or haven't heard most of these tracks before. If you already have all of Pac's albums then I don't recommend this unless Pac is your favorite mc and you want to buy this to have a full collection of his cds."
5,A man is not dead until he is forgotten - Tupac,"this is an awsome cd, it is mix of his old and his new!!!If u love tupac i recommend this cd to u!!!! i cant wait to go see his movie friday november 15th!!!!"
2,Pac is sick this album licks.,"Ok if Pac was alive Pac would have never let this album be produced. Half of these reviewers don't know about Pac or the orgin of these songs. So let me tell you. Half of these song's are from older Pac albums and the rest were bad enough that they never made it past the tape reel. When you make as much music as he did it's not going to all be platinum material. Pac is one of the best rappers in history, he's an icon even in the afterlife, but folks save your money and buy this cats old stuff before you waste your time with this joint."
3,Why 50 Cent?!!!!,"I Have To Tell You, I am The Biggest Pac fan of them all, buti don't understand it. 1-13 were good, but when it Got To 14 (The Realist Killaz) and i saw heard 50 Cent's verse and i wondered why?! Why did they put 50 on A 2Pac Song? If Pac werealive he'd be kickin 50's ass..."
2,4 da Luv of Pac,I'm truly a Pac fan got everything he evvvaaa made. Which is why this I aint feeling. it's only 3 things on here that weren't on any previous Cd's. I was expecting more. But it was a soundtrack & it is Pac.
3,PACxploitation at BEST,"As it relates to the 2Pac:Resurrection SDTK, I'm gonna keep it short & sweet. PACxploitation at best. And I mean that in a good way. While I was LOVIN' Eminem's reworking of ""Runnin""(f/t Notorious B.I.G., RIP), and the joints from 'Pac's older works, the album would've passed for a classic if there weren't such a D12 flavor about the joints featurin' Outlawz...and now that 50 is startin' to pop out...Em could've left him off of Realest Killaz, cause while he's clownin' Ja still...HE AINT PAC EITHER, only a petty thief from up north who got shot up and lived to see another day. But overall, this one's still a keeper if for nothin' other than hearin' Pac & Biggie together. Pac & Biggie, RIP."
3,Ghost,"This album is generally of an expected standard by Tupac, so the 3 star rating is by tupac standards, but by the standard of Rap today I would say its a 4 or 5. GHOST is unbelievably strong and represents the type of strong lyrics that rappers should bring to the table if the want to be taken seriously. Rapping about ICE and 20"" rims is ok but can get very boring very fast. Tupac raps about whats real!!"
3,The Gospel At Colonus,The songs are wonderful. My only regret is that there is no DVD of the actual performance available. I loved the presentation on TV when it aired. I've looked for the DVD everywhere.
2,Not his best,"I'm a big fan of Keith Laumer, I've been reading his books since the 1960s. I love most of his work, but this is a very inferior example. I've been told that Keith Laumer had a stroke, and that this was written afterward. I can't verify that, but it sounds right. His sense of humor is all but gone, along with most if his timing, which is what usually drives his stories. This is an easy read, somewhat amusing, but I can't really recommend it. If you want Laumer at his best, try Dinosaur Beach."
5,Most Excellent Resource,"I own numerous quote books (and use them weekly) but none of them are so full of great quotes(pardon the expression) as this one. Every page has numerous quotes that are succinct and interesting for most any reader.The book is lacking when it comes to crediting sources I will admit...but there are just so many gems here in such an accessible format. Many books are ponderous with the amount and number of quotes...this book has about 10 to 15 quotes per page that are pithy, to the point and organized well.(If you really want to find out who said what you can google any quote and usually you will find the original source.)"
2,Very Disappointed,"As a fellow quote collector, I have bought nearly every quote book I have ever run across. This is literally the first quote book I have ever seen with hundreds of quotations that do not list the author of the quote...not exactly what most quote lovers are looking for.I did give the book an extra star because I enjoyed the table of contents that seperated the quotes by categories, which most quote books do not do. There are plenty of good quotes in here, but I would advise customers to take advantage of the ""Search Inside"" function on Amazon to make sure that this book is the kind of quote book they are looking for."
4,The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and Other Pieces,"Thank you the book was in great shape, the book was for my son, it was required reading for his english class. He liked the book. He even told me he thinks I would enjoy reading it."
5,great sound,"I owned a Onkyo amp purchase 12 yrs ago. Now I bought this onewow what a difference - clear - crisp sound,- I use it to listen to music and its greatcan't say enough about how good this."
4,"very good ""throwback"" integrated amp","After a break in period the amplifier sounds fine through my Infinity Primus P162 speakers. Very nice range when kept in the speakers limits, when pushed the sound gets compressed and harsh--but I am thinking its the speakers and not the amp. The phono section seems to be good, I need a new cartridge to be able to judge accurately. I recently got all new equipment, which makes it hard to compare, but I'm happy with the amp, its much nicer sounding than the 1990 vintage chinese Marantz it replaced. Also got a Sony HD tuner and its a nice pair with this amplifier... very nice sound... I can crank the dance/trance commercial free station I get and feel right there in da club!"
1,A-9555 Amplifier died after 14 months,I purchased this amplifier with the Onkyo CD player DX7555 Audiophile Single Disc CD Player. They made beautiful music together but the A-9555 amplifier just died about 14 months after my purchase. I then discovered how difficult it is too get any service on an Onkyo product. I cannot recommend any Onkyo hifi product based on my experience. My only option is to take it to a third party repair service who will open it up for $70 with no guarantee that it can be repaired and the location is not convenient. The CD player is doing well. I would recommend that one consider post-purchase support or repair availability in buying these very complicated hifi components. There should be a site that rates the long term reliability of these components. I am not alone with the experience of a Onkyo amplifier/AV receiver just dying on them.
2,Missing balance control knob!,"I agree that this is a good amplifier. However, it lacks a balance control knob, making it is impossible to adjust the relative loudness of the left and right channels. I consider this to be a major design flaw."
1,No Quality Control - Unit DOA,"Apparently Onkyo has limited quality control. The unit arrived DOA (Remote unresponsive, all source selector lights lit up except for the Tuner & MD lights. No other lights would light up).On a side note, for those planning on using the phono pre-amp, it does not work with Moving Coil cartridges.***UPDATED***I packed up the defective unit and sent it back to Amazon. While packing up the defective unit I noticed that something was loose inside. Perhaps the unit was damaged in shipping and it had nothing to do with Onkyo's quality control. I don't know.What I do know is that my replacement unit works and the sound is absolutely stunning. The Pure Audio button is is a very welcome feature as it allows me to hear the sound from my records the way it was intended. For reference I have this hooked up to a Rega P3-24 turntable with a high output moving coil cartridge. That's right, it does work with my high output moving coil cartridge. Your mileage may vary."
2,Mine must have been different to what others are listening to...,"I really wanted to like this amp - because it's cheap...But unfortunately I found the bass to be unnaturally overblown and loose sounding - I particularly like a clean and tight sounding bass, which this certainly wasn't.My unit had HiFi Tuning fuses added for what it's worth.I am now using a Denon PMA2000IVR which is light years ahead of the Onkyo."
1,"Customer service is bad, hope nothing goes wrong with it!",I just got off the line with their product support. They were very rude to me. It seemed they were trying to get me off the phone as quick as possible. Completely unwilling to help or stand by there product. Buy one and hope nothing ever goes wrong with it.
1,not product advertised online,"I am returning this item because it does not include a receiver. On the description of product line on the website it is listed as a receiver (""Onkyo Digital 85 Watt Stereo Receiver""). My understanding, based on information on the website, was that it was both an amplifier and a receiver. Since I need a unit that performs both functions, I am returning it."
5,"Love him and hate him, Kane is a great hero","Karl Edward Wagner's character Kane is a great blending of Moorcock's tragic hero Elric, with his sorcerous powers, and Robert E. Howard's Conan, with his enormous physical strenght and skilled swordsmanship... Kane is a great hero, with some of the best sci-fi stories I've ever read- and I've read just about all of 'em... Give Kane a try- especially Bloodstone, Night Winds and Death Angel's Shadow..."
4,Blood and Chaos rules all.,"If you are a chaos and violence fan then this book is for you.Kane is the main chara. in the book. A huge immortal warrionthat lets no one control him. Gods or Kings beware for whereKane goes, death and destruction is not for behind. In thisbook, he is after a relic known as the Bloodstone ring. Withthis ring he can finally rule the world. This has always beenhis aim for Kane will be controlled by no one. He may feigntan alliance but in the end only Kane will gain an advantage."
2,Disappointing,"Wagner's stories of Kane, his infamous anti-hero, have reached legend status within the fantasy and horror literature communities and their being out of print can make it difficult to even get a glimpse of one of modern fantasy's epic anti-heroes.Perhaps I let that hype raise expectations too much, as I found this work to be fairly uninspired. Kane, as an anti-hero, seems to lack much that might draw a reader to root for the bad guy. He lacks the sort of dark humor that might make his evil exploits truly entertaining and, while the characters in the book call him a genius, the reader is likely to understand the elements of his plots for conquest far sooner than the characters themselves. In that sense, there's not much here that kept my attention.Based on the ratings, it's apparent that others disagree greatly with my assessment and, should you decide to delve into the world of Kane, I hope that you get greater enjoyment out of it than I."
5,Grand Slam,"I loved this show as a kid, and watching Batman Begins resparked my love for Batman. I saw sets being sold for 30-40 dollars, and then all three were being sold for 96 or more used. But Amazon has an amazing deal where you can buy all 3 volumes for less then buying them seperate and get free shipping. My set was shipped on Wenesday and I got it by Saturday, notaa bad deal at all. The only problem I notice is the video sometimes have some white spots on it, but other then that im very pleased with the purchase. Batman is the greatest super hero ever!"
4,Wait One Second,"This collection misses a vital episode! Somehow, everyone forgot about the fantastic episode ""Judgement Day"" where Two-Face develops a third personality, The Judge. If you are a true Batman fan like myself, you will want to ask the creators of this collection, where in the world is that episode. Although this is a phenomenal collection, it is incomplete!"
1,Disappointed in the quality,"I was very disappointed in the sound quality of the birds. You can hardly decipher some of the birds sounds. The price is low, but now I know why. For bird lovers, I would not recommend this."
2,Lost potential,"This is a great idea especially for beginning birders. Once past sight identification, sound identification is such a great help. The device is handy and quite easy to use. However, this instrument flops due to lack of crisp sound quality and limited number of birds featured. It is unfortunate that, putting aside the sound quality problem, additional packets cannot be purchased to add to the number of bird songs."
2,Kelp forest fishes,"This video is apparently aimed at children and the narration reflects that. Some of the video was shot under less than ideal conditions, too. For the price, though, it's not all that bad and it provides a pretty complete view of the common fish and invertebrates encountered in California's kelp forests. I put some classical music on the stereo, mute the TV sound, and watch this video with my morning coffee as a ""virtual"" dive."
4,remember this???,"gotta love this was sooo excited to see this. Madonna at her best (well in my opinion) and just pure 80's fluff and fun.Relive the past, love the music and enjoy!! I know I did and have introduced this to a whole new generation with much enjoyment."
4,Great 80s comedy,"This is a great little comedy from the 80s. It did a great job of capturing the hip and trendy at the time as well as using the tried and true conventions of amnesia and mistaken identities and the fish-out-of-water gag. The cast is so appealing here: Arquette and Quinn are adorable; Metcalfe and Wright are hillarious, and Madonna is Madonna and that is just perfect for this film. A great rainy day or pick-me-up film that has aged well for the 80s in the same way Doris & Rock did for the 60s."
3,Desperately Seeking Madonna.,"Desperately Seeking Susan was Madonna's first film and probably still her best performance. Too bad Rosanna Arquette took a backseat to the superstar, her performance is just as good too. I like and dislike this film, parts are entertaining but this comedy seems too lightweight as well. Aidan Quinn's beautiful eyes is reason alone to watch this '80s classic. Ok movie but nothing special."
2,"Not worth buying, unless you're a Madonna fan...","I'm a big Madonna fan, but honestly, I didn't like this movie. It was boring. Madonna is a co-star and I might have liked it more if I got to see more of her in it but I just don't care for Rosanna Arquette's character in the film. The amnesiac storyline is done so many times... Save your money and rent this is you're just looking for a movie to watch. But of course if youre a Madonna fan, then this should be a part of your collection just for the sake of Madonna being in it."
5,A great look at New York City,"This is one of my favorite movie ever and i do believe that is maybe the most representative picture on the New York of the '80's.Watching it is like you live the life of that period.The story is about Roberta, a bored housewife who lives in Fort Lee and daydreams about Susan's life, a wanderer girl who keeps in contact with her boyfriend through the ads on the newspapers.Roberta has got the main chance to follow Susan in a beautiful walk trip from Battery Park through Manhattan's Lower East Side;equivocals by equivocals Roberta's life is meant to be changed for good.Roberta is played great by Rosanna Arquette who won a Bafta for her performance;Madonna gave us her best performance as Susan on her screen debut.The scene when Roberta,in the middle of her birthday party,goes out on the balcon to take a look at Manhattan island is extraordinary and let us understand all the gloom of her character."
5,best madonna movie!!!,this is definately my all-time favorite madonna movie. i just love 80s movies and this is one of them. i've seen this movie many times. i love the plot and that fact that it's taken place in nyc. this is one of the few movies that madonna shows some good acting skills. i think she can only display good acting skills if she portrays a character that is similar to herself. i also love the outfits that she wore. the bathroom scene of her changing and using the hand dryer to dry her hair is epic. the movie was just so incredibly funny and romantic at the same time. this movie is definately for all 80s lovers and madonna's fans alike.
5,A Great Madonna Movie,"I remember as a teenager seeing the TV advertisement of this movie, and had been wanting to see it at the theaters, but I never got to. I was a fan of Madonna then, and I am still one now. I finally got to watch it years later on VHS. The 1980s fads and fashions in this movie really brought me back memories, plus it is a very good movie! The punk nightclub scene made me laugh when the bald guy ended up dancing with Roberta's husband who was trying to dance with Madonna. I especially like the twists and turns the characters in this movie brings. I recommend anyone to watch this movie, because it is a very interesting tale and I never got bored watching it, even if you were a 1980s teenager like I was."
5,Good,"This book is a great read, I suggest that anyone who is interested in rhetoric and composition get this book!"
1,Poor Construction!,"When looking for good resistance bands, do NOT buy Danskin. The handles are affixed by means of a bulb pushed through a ring. Not only does this poor design not hold up to (go figure) resistance, it also snaps the bulbs off and sends them flying (not to mention snapping the hell out of the user with the broken end of the tubing...OUCH!). Do yourself a favor and stick with the GoFit or Thera-Band brands."
1,Poor Design!,"When looking for good resistance bands, do NOT buy Danskin. The handles are affixed by means of a bulb pushed through a ring. Not only does this poor design not hold up to (go figure) resistance, it also snaps the bulbs off and sends them flying (not to mention snapping the hell out of the user with the broken end of the tubing...OUCH!). Do yourself a favor and stick with the GoFit or Thera-Band brands."
1,bad purchase,"This is a horrible product that will not get you in shape. It offers no resistance or weight training. I know it's like 17 bucks, but I can find something better to do with 17 bucks and so can you."
3,ok-ish,"I used this for about 10 months and then the elastic broke. Given its price, I think it is not bad. I am planning to buy a higher resistance ones and see how long that holds."
2,Way too big!,"This would be great for meds/vitamins that are on your counter, but not for what I was wanting it for (to carry in my purse).Like many other reviewers, I noticed the 'flip-lid' (the hole where the pills come out) is a little difficult to open, and looks like it might break when used a lot."
4,Great to keep many pills organized,I'm very pleased. The previous one I had was similar and lasted about 2 years before the plastic got cloudy and a bit cracked. I'm sure this one will not last any longer; that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It keeps the pills separate and organized and lets me know my remaining supply at a glance.
5,As good as the old one!,"This is a replacement for one just like it. I had the old one for about eight years when it finally needed replaced, the flip top was broken. I fully expect this one to last at least that long!"
1,Not what I expected for a great idea,It is way too big. I bought it thinking it would be great as a gift for my parents to put all of their medication into one container. When I received the dispenser I was disappointed to find that it was bigger than my coffee cup.
5,Good traveler,"Although I haven't used this dispenser yet, I bought it for when I travel. My last cruise partner had one and it worked perfectly for her so I decided to purchase one for my next travel. When it arrived the lid was cracked on the edge, I contacted the provider and he promptly replaced the lid, no charge. I thought that was amazing!"
4,Very helpful,"Very helpful. It has been a very good review for me on driving techniques -- sometimes you forget.I do disagree with him on two points. I would not ever get out of a car to pick up something on the freeway or get involved in dealing with an accident on a busy freeway that I was not a party to. Also, you should not get out of your car and approach the patrol car if an officer pulls you over -- the officer needs time to finish checking your plate on the radio and does NOT want to deal with you yet!Yes, it does meander off-topic sometimes; yes, it is a very personal style; yes, it is VW-centric. But these aspects do not materially detract from the tremendous amount of thought and collected information in the book. And it is very readable.Well worth the money. Thank you, Mr. Pease!"
2,A sad coda,"It is a sad coda that Bob Pease died in an auto accident this weekend (6-19-2011). Search for ""Driver, 70, Dies in Saratoga Crash"". No seatbelt, 40 year old car, ill health, winding road. He was an icon in his profession."
4,Decent bargain,"Except for the writing on the outside pages, this used textbook was in decent condition when we purchase it. Would purchase from this seller again. Price was fair."
5,A gift with class and meaning,I have always welcomed the opportunity to give a gift that has conversation as its central theme that is both ongoing and reflective.
1,Love the VARIATIONS,"I have recently fallen in love with Multi grain CRIX (green package). I know...there is wholewheat too geeeeeeeeeez...NOTHING beats the taste of Multigrain!! Try it, I'm so sure you WILL like it. Once you start using it, you will continue to buy it. CRIX really is a VITAL supply, that's why I keep one in my office drawer..."
1,Not the Tru Congnito,"When i first seen that Cognito had a new album out in 2005 i was excited to hear it. Have yet to hear this album, and will most likely choose not to, however I listened to a couple of samples at music.[...] and realized this is not the same artist whom brought out the Tru Cognizance album with Poe Boy Entertainment. Cognito is from Florida this guy raps about westcoast. Plus his flow and voice sound like the standard california wanna be Tupac artist. Dont know which Cognito was first but this is not the Good one."
1,A Communitarian pusher,"A clue as to where and how the West would be roped, harnessed and destroyed. All in double speak. His vision not ours and not America's."
4,"Unpolished, but good.","Live After Death was pretty much a flawless live metal album. It's so polished it pretty much shines. Which frankly is not *always* what you want from a live metal concert. With A Real Live One we have the band playing with less polish and perfectionism. In Live After Death it sounded like they were playing in huge arenas fully packed with adoring audiences. Here it sounds like they're playing in ""mere"" medium sized venues, and frankly I prefer it.A rough diamond."
3,An alright one.,"The CD came quickly, however I did notice the sound quality sounded as though it had been a mp3 download. I am not complaining, considering the price along with shipping was around 4 dollars, but I was a little disappointed, that will not deter me from ordering from them again!"
3,Puppy not a hug big fan,"I got this to mix in with my weimaraner puppys hard food to try and get him to eat more when even if I was not in the same room. It worked at first he ate it but was not overly thrilled with it. After a few days he did not like it as much and only ate it if I was around. So I had to try something else. Good product I know other people whos dogs love it, mine did not."
3,Nice set,"several flaws in the marble, almost too many to overlook mention. A nice set overall, but the board could be of much higher quality with fewer natural flaws (gaps, flaws, cracks, etc..)average. you would not accept this as your countertop in the kitchen."
4,This Company is customer service focused,I am happy with my purchase of this product. I think you would enjoy this chess set.
3,THERE IS NO VIEWMASTER INCLUDED!,"I purchased this for myself actually, a fun toy from my childhood. However, the deceiving product description states:Product Features:3D reelsViewmasterDisneySleeping BeautytoyBUT there is NO VIEWMASTER INCLUDED. YOU MUST BUY IT SEPERATELY! Just FYI."
5,Sleeping Beauty View Master Reel,I loved the viewmaster and the reels when I was young. This is what my granddaughter saw in a catalog and asked for for Christmas. I think Sleeping Beauty and the other princesses are her favorites.
2,Short Term Investment,"I first one I got lasted 6 months. The customer service was good and they sent me out a brand new one. This last one lasted almost a year. But now that it broke after the 1 year warranty of the original purchase, I'm SOL. If you want a disc printer that will last more than a year, look elsewhere."
1,"Great idea, but poor quality","I was really excited to get this product it was exactly what I was looking for. The day I received it, took it out of the box and tried it. Hooked it up and printed my first cd (one included in the box). The logo that I had downloaded was printed incorrectly in one quadrant and another quadrant had text misprinted. 2 out 4 quadrants misprinted. Hmm, I tried it again and again . . . after 6 cds I gave up. E-mailed Primera and they gave me RMA. At first wanting me to send it back on my dime. I protested and they sent me a shipping label. Waited for the second unit, hoping it was a fluke. Second unit, same thing . . . now I'm returning it for a credit. I hope no one else has the same problems.Like I said great idea but the product did not deliver. I guess I'll have to buy a Epson or HP to print directly onto the cds."
4,Ribbons are a little inconsistent,"I've printed hundreds of discs with this printer and, when it works correctly, the finished product is great. However, it doesn't always work correctly and, on occasion, the output is a mess.What I have discovered is that the printer isn't really at fault when I get a bad print job. It's always been the ribbon. The take-up reel is very unforgiving and, if you get twists in the used-up ribbon, the print job won't be very good. With the exception of one ribbon that I could never get to feed correctly, I've always been able to solve the problem by pulling the used ribbon out and rewinding it on to the take-up reel with a pencil. I shouldn't have to do that, but it isn't like these things cost a fortune, either. You get what you pay for, and I'm fairly satisfied with this printer."
5,"The Z1 is a great, low volume CD/DVD printer","We use the Z1 to print professional looking labels on our CD/DVD projects. This is more of a 1 off printer. Each disc must be loaded and unloaded manually, and if you're looking to do volume labeling, this isn't the printer for you. If you only need to do the occasional label that looks professionally done, this is the perfect machine. One caveat - This printer prints monochrome labels. There are 4 colors available, but the color of the cartridge determines the the color of the entire label."
1,If You Feel Like Wasting $140 Just Send It To Me,"I will send you a rock or a hairbrush or something else that won't print on discs either.I am on my second printer. The first one stopped working after 3 labels so I sent it back. This one has worked for several months now, however won't print on the botom part of the disc unless you hold the carriage down, so I hardly ever use it.Cue the disappointed trumpet noise... wah-wah."
4,Very good performance but color is lacking,"The good: The Primera Z1 delivers excellent and reliable printing directly onto the surface of a standard CD or DVD. It works much better with text printing than any graphics printing. The thermal nature of the printer prevents any ""rub-off"" or smudging even immediately after printing. It does work best with unlabeled CDs (although it will print over any other markings or engravings on the CD). The ink cartridge lasts a very long time (I have printed over 200+ CDs on my first cartridge). The software is easy to use (but a bit limited).On the downside: The Primera only prints in one color. To get any other colors, you need to buy and replace the standard black cartridge. It is also pretty slow (it takes about 45-60 seconds to print a CD with pretty basic labels). It is also expensive for a one-dimensional CD printer.Overall: This is a quality product for those who only want to print text labels in one color onto CDs."
5,GREAT PRICE,This is a nice pack of Baby Einstein dvd's. My son is 16.5 months and has been mesmerized by BE dvd's all of his life. I feel these are a necessity for every home with a baby.
2,mediocre programs,"My daughter Kelsey (1 year and 8 month) owns about 12 of these Baby Einstein DVD's (gift pack 1,2,3). She is not a fan. I don't think she ever watched any of those DVD in its entirety. I find that, regardless of the ""age guidelines"" on the Baby Einstein videos, there are a lot of overlapping and simple ""scenes"" with shots of plastic toys that never really facinated her. As I watch plenty of children videos nowadays, I do feel the Baby Einstein series are comparatively boring and repetitive. The whole series just appear cheap and simplistic.Obviously every child is different and Baby Einstein seems to work great for most parents, but I would strongly suggest buying only ONE dvd at a time to see how yours react instead of buying too many in one go like I did. My daughter loves the Wiggles and will sit through...no, rather, dance through, the whole DVD. She also like Barney so I know she will watch children programs if we give her the right one."
1,Not What I Ordered,The title of my order was Baby Einstein Gift Pack Volume 3 and the format was a DVD. I received one CD. I returned it and got my money back. I was impressed though at how quickly I received a refund and how easy it was to return something to Amazon. I had never done that before.
5,Definitely worth purchasing!,"Baby Galileo and Baby Neptune are our favorites! It has a ""repeat play"" option if you need longer than a half hour - I also use this in the middle of the night if my daughter won't go back to sleep. I'm definitely a fan!"
4,My son loves these,"While I don't particularly advocate tv for babies and I don't believe these to be super educational, everytime its on my son (8 months) is MESMERIZED! Its become a wonderful tool to allow me to shower! lol my son is quite attached to me. He moves side to side, his way of dancing, when the classical music comes on. I am very glad we have these around and appreciate how entertained my son is by them. I also love to hear the classical music myself;)"
5,These are a life saver!,"I bought this video collection for my sister. I have the entire baby Einstein collection and I cannot live without it. It was the only way I was able to even get time to take a shower when my kids were infants. It is also a great teaching tool, my son (who is 3) loves to watch and repeat the words and signs that he sees on the videos. I also find them very entertaining, even from an adult perspective. It is really fantastic that it doesn't annoy the parents, entertains the kids, exposes them to fine art and music, and helps them learn. This is a must have for any parent."
5,One of my Top 10 albums of all time!,"I remember hearing The Adventure track on the radio for the first time. I knew Tom's voice right away, but it wasn't the old Blink 182 sound. It was modern and upbeat. I love the new sound and am also very pleased with i-empire. I can listen to this album all the way through over and over and it's great to fall asleep to. The Adventure is my favorite track."
5,A Unique Historical Perspective (Why Didn't We Know Before?),"This is the unique perspective on the discovery of the New World and its conquest by the Europeans. Wright has written a fantastic book based on years of research that dispels myths that are still taught in classrooms all over the western hemisphere. This is a definitive book for New World or Latin American history - and it's also a great story for the rest of us!.Wright follows the stories of each major Native North and South American culture through each of three time periods that span from the landing of Columbus to the present day. Haven't we heard this before? No! The book is based on actual accounts from Spanish missionaries, Aztec kings, Iriquois documents and U.S. History.What was the Cherokee role in the Civil War? What happened to all the books written by the Inca? What myths are still taught to children in our schools? Discover this and more in this book about how the Western Hemisphere discovered Europe"
2,If you have a UTI,"They claim it's 100% accurate which it probably is, but my problem with this product is the top portion of the dip stick. The color is never what it is on the chart. I find myself looking under every lamp to see if I can see it better. I always end up calling the company to ask what it means if the color isn't the same as their chart for negative, but it's also not the same color if there was an infection. I'd pass next time.Tiny Dancer"
4,Be careful could be wrong film,"Be careful. I've seen this film but under the listing Aftermath', which turned out to be this film, Genesis, instead. The question then is if you buy the on demand version of this listing will it too be Genesis or will it be Aftermath?"
5,Well with your time......,"What a comfort to read this book, If you are struggling with an adolescent daughter, do yourself a favor, take the time and read this. It will validate how you are feeling, and also help you to recognize that things are going to be ok......"
1,what were they thinking?,"The book lists every fantasy book ever written by any third rate female author. At the same time it misses absolute classics of the genre, for example the Cyberiad or the Roadside Picnic.This is a very distorted picture of science fiction and fantasy. If somebody's looking for pointers about books to read, there are much better resources both in print and on the web. I'd include URLs but Amazon's policy is that the reviews should not contain URLs. So you have to search on your own. But don't worry, it is easy to find better sources than this book."
5,Very delicate and pretty!,I used two panels along with the matching valance and together these pieces look great! I couldn't be happier with the results!
2,"Tomie won't die. She goes on and on, just like her movie.","Tomie one super hot love-love cutie. Tomie steal boyfriends from other girls. Other girls not like this. They write ""Demon Girl"" on Tomie's pictures. Boys see pictures, they go crazy and chop Tomie's head off. Bye bye, Tomie.But Tomie CANNOT DIE. Tomie come back, kill everyone you know, and make you eat a bug. So THERE, girls who write nasty things on Tomie's pictures! And there is a twist ending! Very surprising! Also completely impossible to understand! Ah, so frightening!More to the point, this odd, sadistic film drags on endlessly before finally reaching an inane and bloody conclusion that makes no sense whatsoever. I only recommend it to rabid fans of gore movies that make you feel icky and sleepy at the same time."
3,Interesting but.........,"I found this film to leave a lot of things open. So, anyone who can break it down for me. Please do......"
2,Uh what happened here?,"I have been a fan of Junji Ito's work since Uzumaki. Chances are if it has his name on it, I've read it,seen it, or both. The man and his work are inspiring for manga/horror. Tomie(the movie) is slow paced at best, the acting is sub-par, and just...what was going on here? So many plot holes you could drive a convoy of semi's through. Also if you got the ending of this film consider yourself lucky. By the end I thought it was a David Lynch film. On the upside the subtitles were excellent, but understanding what they said only confused me more. Good luck."
3,Ok little horror movie,"I saw this movie a few months ago on an import dvd. I do have to say, the movie was VERY VERY slow. It had some creepy moments, and some good acting, but in the end, it was just to slow. Also, there is some very out of place nudity, and some sequences (like the flash back of the death of a particular student) that just fall flat due to weak direction. Maybe Replay will be better. I shall see."
4,Nice case,"As a lot of Epiphone owners have learned, cases designed for the Gibson ES-335 clones won't fit Epiphone guitars, as the Epiphones have a slightly larger headstock. This case, however, fits my Dot Custom like a glove. The padding is perfect, the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar, and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level."
5,Fits like a glove,"I got this for my Epi Sheraton II:PROS: It fits perfectly; it's ""fur"" lined and has a decent sized internal compartment; it's solid and the hardware is sturdy; it has one locking latch (out of five), but nothing that would stop a real thief; it has two knobs on the bottom that allow the case to stand on end without tipping over, two knobs on the side for when you put it down on its side, and three knobs on the back that allow it to lay down without being completely on the ground; it's relatively thin.CONS: It's heavy; the handle is positioned oddly and at an angle; it has some ""Made in China"" characteristics.I've had several cases and this is one of the nicest. On a personal level, I'd prefer it didn't say ""Epiphone"" on the outside. But since it does it's a good place to hide a $3000 Gibson 335."
4,Fits my Dot (with Bigsby) just barely,"I have an Epiphone Dot and I installed a Bigsby V5 on it. I could not find a gig bag for semi hollow body guitar so settled on this one due to the price. And a previous reviewer said his Dot with Bigsby fits. Well it fits, but just barely. The guitar fits snugly in the plush lined case. I have to turn the arm of the Bigsby around, facing down, to close the case. I think the case probably pushes the arm down a little bit even in this position. I probably wouldn't store my guitar in this case for long periods cuz I'd worry about tension on the strings. Otherwise I like it."
4,Perfect for my Epiphone Dot!,"Good quality, just what I needed for my Epiphone Dot Archtop. Guitar fits snuggly, case is very solid. Very good deal here."
4,Just about perfect.,"What's there to say? It's a case. The Guitar fits? Almost everything was perfect, loved the little pouch inside. I was unaware it was (supposed) to come with a locking buckle in front, too bad it's broken, or if it's not then I'm just absolutely stupid and can't figure out how it works. That doesn't concern me too much though. All in all I'm happy with the purchase, it should do fine to protect my new baby Dot."
4,Meets Expectations,"Does what it says it will do. Great quality, looks well built and solid. Doesn't feel plasticy (made out of wood or something that feels like wood) or cheap. It still doesn't serve the purpose with my belts that dont have rings, i.e. the slide and punch hole kinds."
4,Helpful,I love the amount of belts I can put on this hanger. I love it! The material is really good.
4,Love it!!,"This is a very nice & sturdy belt rack. Before I was using a hanger & it was frustrating tryigng to get to the belt on the bottom of the stack. Now I can easily grab the belt I need. The only downside for me is that I have a few belts with very narrow loops so they don't hang on the hooks, but I use the top part to place them on instead, similar to what I was doing before."
4,Wish it had a way to secure the belts,"I put at least two belts on each hook, and sometimes they don't stay put. Otherwise it works fine and looks good."
3,"Sturdy, well built (for thin belts)","The product is well made except for ONE minor issue. If all your belts look like the product picture then it will work great. But for women who have more stylish belts with bigger belt buckles, it does not work very well, the large belt buckles won't fit."
3,Doesn't work with belt buckels,This is a find product but notice as pictured if you have any standard belt buckles like a cowboy would wear they don't fit on the hanger.
4,why did you choose this rating?,Just perfect for the belts. Very easy the place belts on the hanger and very easy to remove when needed.
4,Useful accessory for anyone's closet.,Useful accessory for anyone's closet. It very reasonable and I am using it for at least 10 belts ; it stays on your closet rack and you are good to go!
2,I am STILL waiting...,The seller has not contacted me concerning the obvious delay in shipping. This is not good customer service.
5,it's great I love it,"product arrived NEXT DAY! everything is in a perfect condition, first i think the hooks will be not big enough, but fortunately it is, i can hang even two belts on one hook. Love it!"
5,Joe M,I was very happy with this purchase; it allows me to keep all of my various belts organized for easy storage and selection.I recommend this product.
5,"Good quality product, saves space","The brand of this belt organizer that I ordered and received was ""It's Your Planet"" made by Richards Homewares. It is good quality. I've seen similar-looking belt racks that are lower quality with cheap wood and thin hooks.This belt hanger is about 17-1/2 inches long and 3/4 inch thick. It has 12 belt hooks - six on each side. Each hook will hold a few belts if you want to load it up. Obviously you have to balance them out, front to back, or the hanger will tilt.The wood seems strong and the hooks are secure. The wood is nearly 3/4 inch thick.You may get a different color from that pictured or described in the ad listing. I got black instead of the walnut brown listed. From the photo on the attached tag, it also comes in a natural clear wood finish (and maybe some other colors too)."
3,"OK for men, not for women","Good quality, but the design is mostly for guy's belts. The hooks are too thick to fit in most women's thin belt buckles."

3,Read their lips!,"I have seen this DVD for the third time now but either I am going deaf or something is wrong withmy TV sound. I bought it for the witty dialogue a.o., but half of the time I simply cannot hear what the actorsare saying. I turned up the volume and read their lips, but still the good cast (!) are happily mumbling and whispering along most of the time - (is that what they mean by 'tongue in cheek'? ) ...and then there is also this disturbing background music!All in all I find it very strenuous to follow what is being said and I don't believe that was the idea.It feels as if it has been dubbed afterwards and perhaps the actors were asked to only whisper to give it some sort of intimate feeling; who knows?I should have looked for a DVD with subtitles and I am sorry to give this a bad review because the actors, costumes and scenes are really nice, but it would have been better to also get the bloody point - so sorry, Mr. Wilde."
1,HORRIBLE re-issue of an otherwise EXCELLENT film!,"I was truly shocked at just how bad this re-issue looks! Mushy, washed out color and ALL of the action on screen including even the camera pans were completely lacking in fluidity. Motion archives from beginning to end. Nearly unwatchable! Mind you, this was not the fault of my player as it was tested in several units. Shame on you Echo Bridge for this horrible transfer of an otherwise excellent film! I would warn everyone to stay clear of this re-issue, and seek out the original Miramax release from 2000. Even the cover art of the original release is far superior to this sloppy mess."
2,Oscar Wilde Lite,"As other reviewers have been, I'm also unhappy with the removal of central plot elements, especially Mrs. Cheveley's broach. The effect of removing this element is that it is Chiltern who saves Goring, not Goring who saves Chiltern, and the play therefore never gives Goring his moment of heroism and nobility. This film is too jolly and innocent. Laura Cheveley's hubris, Robert Chiltern's anguish, these are really side shows in the film which focuses more on Goring, his wit, and his pre-marital uncertainty.I do think the film is entertaining, for what it is worth. Anyone who has an interest in romantic comedy or a very casual interest in Wilde will probably enjoy it. If you know this play and Oscar Wilde well, though, you may be frustrated."
3,An okay film,"The ideal husband falls short in pacing and interest level. If you like priggish Victorian-era characters who have difficulty communicating feelings with one another then this movie is for you. Yes, the dialogue is witty, but you end up feeling like the movie was 3 hours long and that, in the end, you didn't really care about the characters all that much. The acting is good, but I suppose it was the director's fault that this film didn't achieve greatness. This is a rental only, I wouldn't recommend buying it with so many other great comedies out there like Emma, Much Ado About Nothing and even Shakespeare in Love."
3,Ok but it could have been better,I liked this movie but I almost gave it two stars but the cast is grate they make the movie a hole lot better then it would of ended up to be without them. Cate Blanchett is just a grate acctres and I think she did better in this movie then she did in Elisabeth. Minnie Driver is grate in evrey movie that she is in and I love her she will win a Award for one of her movies or at least she should. Rupert Everett well I have not seen too many movies that he has been in but he is grate in this movie offcorse he dose make the movie seem boring in some points of the movie where he is the only one flubing and the rest of the cast are playing there parts with no flubs. Julianne Moore is another grate actress and I love all the movies that she is in.
2,not good,"quite boring. this actor, Rupert Evert, was a hit in ""my best friend's wedding"" but didi nothing for me in ths movie."
5,Great movie,"I dont watch much tv and less movies but this was an exceptional exception. A fuuny, witty, romantic and intrigueful movie, I laughed throughout, and have seen it three times. It is addicting as it is welcome relief from the usual romantic [stuff] out there, this is romance with brains and wit, not for the simple minded."
2,Wilde was wilder,"A vain attempt to straighten out Oscar. Or at least tidy him up a bit. This adaptation takes out the obvious machinations of the play, and presents us with an extremely pallid ""real"" version.Why? The very definition of Wilde's art was in its artifice. That said, there are some saving graces. A delightfully witchy Julianne Moore (who keeps proving she can do ANYTHING). A lovely Cate Blanchett taking a cypher of a character and making you believe. But other eyebrows were way too arched. And why did I get the distinct impression that the cameraman was having a torrid affair with Rupert Everett?"
4,Good movie.,"I love Wilde's sense of ridiculous. The understated humor, in combination with the glamour of the first circles in England, creates a very entertaining movie."
4,Amusing & Witty...,"An Ideal Husband is based on Oscar Wilde's play with the same name, which is a witty comedy about black mail, presumptions, and the search for true love. The film has the same elements and is set in the British sophisticated upper-class society where ""there are those who seek a husband and those who hide from them."" In addition, there is a source of unreliable information and black mail that increases the chances for assumptions. Entering the story with this in mind, there will be presumptuous errors that can be fatal for relationships, careers, and friendships. The films' excellent cast and the wit from Oscar Wilde is tied together in an amusing cinematic experience."
4,A classical romp with the British upper class,"Witty repartee abounds in this film filled with scheming, blackmail, and more than a hint of dishonor. Starring the ever so dashing Rupert Everett, as the cad that everyone loves, some more than others. Also starring Cate Blanchette, Julianne Moore, Minnie Driver and Jeremy Northam. Exquisite dialogue, refreshing and aptly delivered by this star studded cast. Kelsana 8/8/02"
4,True to the Play,"The story of the politician Robert Chilton who is threatened by a woman to expose his past should he not give a public address that serves her interests. His friend becomes entangled in the blackmail and is misunderstood by the politician while he tries to rescues him from this woman. The politian's worst fear is the loss of his wife's respect, which is also the concern of his friend Lord Goring.The movie is very true to Oscar Wilde's play. The wit in the conversations, the beauty of the costumes and decorative art, and the actors' expressions were all commendable. I did not like Sir Robert's sister because her looks did not quite match the simplicity of her character. I would have given it five stars had she not been in this movie."
5,highly recommend it,"So much fun to watch this movie. Rupert Everett is the star and he makes you laugh, seemingly without the least bit effort. It fits the character he plays here, a very laid back, unambitious sort of fellow, yet extremely likeable. Minnie Driver plays the eventual object of his affections, yet her role here is a minor one. Julliane Moore plays the nemesis, not a typical character for her. She's good, ofcourse, as is this movie. Enjoy it."
4,Very entertaining,"This movie boasts an awesome ensemble cast, with superb performances from all, especially from Everett (who's absolutely letter-perfectly charming and dashing) and Blanchett (her character's good and kind heart is a pale light that radiates). This is a period piece that's blessed with beautiful, lavish visuals. Though the film is undeniably irresistible, there's something a tiny bit stiff about the way its executed; a few times, the comedy feels a tad bit forced upon, as if we can't feel the humour naturally. Overall, though, ""An Ideal Husband"" is unbelievably witty, magnificently funny, and very entertaining."
3,OK,When I first got it I thought it was to small. But it actually did fit. It is a tight fitting shirt not loose like I thought it was. But is OK
5,"If you're looking for THE book on Photoshop 4 , its this one","I have been disappointed in 3rd party books in the past as they have been either to technical or just a rehash of the softwares manuals. Not with this book. Once you start using this execellent resource you will find that the author is not only passionate about photoshop but also passionate about delivering the sorts of techniques most of us want to know.Best suited for beginners and intermediates, the example tutorials are excellent in their ease of instruction and are easily adaptable to any creative experimentation. You won't regret buying this book and it certainly won't be collecting dust on the bookshelf."
5,Found an Oldie Goldie on Amazon,"Inside Adobe Photoshop 4 is a classic. As a new photoshop user, I needed a comprehensive guide to help me catch up with the rest of the photoshop world. Inside Adobe Photoshop 4 is doing that nicely. Text is easy to read and the accompanying cd provides the material required for the guided tasks.For customers buying a used text ---- make sure it comes with the companion cd!"
1,Could not read companion CD,"Like the person from Florida and others, my versions companion CD did not work, so I wrote the publisher and they sent me another one that also didn't work. This is very frustrating when you hear how wonderful the book is from others. you absolutely cannot do anything without the companion CD and that's where this book fails, it's cmpletely useless without it."
1,"Maybe good for some people, I found it boring and unhelpful","This book definitely does not have a ""cool"" factor, ei it does not show you how to do cool tricks. It may be helpful in some areas of photoshop, but I had already learned much of its contents on my own. It seemed to cover all the stuff I didn't care about, and nothing that interested me. I wish I hadn't wasted my money. I am never buying a book without looking through it beforehand at a store again!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not a solid product,"The reel has a very weak spring and is so small inside that it will not accept the final 10 inches of cord. I would usually purchase much higher end tools, but i will not use it more than 2 to 3 times a year, so I'll keep it. This is not for any serious home shop or for long term use."
4,Good Spikes,these spikes are easy to fit to the shoe and work well. My other purchase of them before had yielded some which fit loosely but this set has been very good Amazon shipping excellent
3,Loose,"Good price. But have experienced spike loss each round with my Nikes. Have not experienced this with other spikes. It's too bad, since they are great spikes otherwise. It's good you get a few spares."
5,Great Price,"Golf spikes, not much to say but these were a great price. As long as you have a tool they were easy to replace."
5,Champ Stinger Spikes with Asics Gel-Tour Lyte Golf Shoes,"I purchased and really enjoy the fit of my Asics Gel-Tour Lyte golf shoes, but the one problem with them is that I always seem to lose 1-2 spikes per round of golf. To solve that problem, I was happy to find the Champ Golf Stinger Spikes with the small metal thread attachment. These threads are a perfect OEM match to the original cleats on the Asics Gel-Tour Lyte. However, to keep these new spikes on the shoes I've applied Medium Strength (blue) Loc-tite to the threads before fitting the cleats to the shoes. Thus far no lost spikes!I've had trouble finding replacement spikes for my shoes at the clubhouse, as not many shoe manufacturers seem to use this metal threaded style. I was very pleased with the speed that these cleats were delivered to me from ClubsandSticks and would purchase them again if needed."
2,wear out too soon,"These spikes wear out too fast. After only two rounds the yellow portions are worn to stubs. The softspike pulsar and black widow tour cleats last much longer, although the BW tour cleats clog with a lot of grass, so I rate the pulsar cleats best."
4,Simplify your life,This book provides checklists for all aspects of life. The lists allow you to be proactive in dealing with the ups and downs of daily living by having everything in order to avoid or take care of an impending or unexpected crisis.
1,I RETURNED this book,"This book is terrible. The lists are disappointingly incomplete and inconsequential. For example:A list on tipping includes tips for restroom attendants, but it omits tips for valet parking. In my life, I have used valet parking significantly more often than a restroom attendant.A list of common foreign phrases omits pronunciations. How useful is that? Knowing the spelling of a phrase does one no good during conversation should the pronunciation of a phrase be very different from its spelling.Basically, if one had been raised by kindly wolves in the forest, and recently dropped into modern society, this book might be marginally useful. But anyone with a modicum of planning or forethought would have outgrown this trite little waste of words and paper by age 10."
1,"Good Idea, Lousy Execution","This is a very disappointing execution of a basically good idea. I bought the book thinking that it would provide clever ideas and strategies for accomplishing tasks that I otherwise would not think of. Unfortunately, there isn't a single list in this book that could be remotely called clever,or original, and some of them are downright bad (see especially ""From Pigsty to Presentable in Six Steps."" Oy!). Unless you've been living in a hermetically sealed bubble your entire life, this book won't do you a bit of good."
1,"Yes, this is for a late teen.","This is one of the internet pit-falls. A book seems very promising, and arrives a disapointment. For ones just starting out in the world, this is a very good book."
3,Goog Quality but colors not as expected,I ordered this online without seeing it in person & was disappointed in the colors. I did not realize there was a checkered black patter in it & did not find the red vibrant enough but it I thought the quality was very good. I decided to pick another set though
4,Knowing how God has designed you,"This relatively short book helps the reader understand how God has uniquely designed each person, with special gifts and talents unlike anybody else. It then guides the reader through a process of self-evaluation in order to reveal those special qualities that determine how we operate, and what we like to do on a daily basis. Armed with this information about himself, the reader is then prepared to look for job opportunities that will match his specific skill set, and result in employment that will have a good probability of being man satisfying, and God glorifying."
3,"A thoughtful, worthwhile movie","A thoughtful, worthwhile movie. . .The courtroom scene is particularly effective.I assume that the movie was based on true events, but then it would be crazy to run a sailing ship with nearly no experienced adults.One thing i didn't like was the overly long shipwreck scene, showing people trapped and drowning. I also skipped the killing of the porpoise.All in all, a very commendable effort."
1,WARNING: RIDLEY SCOTT FANS,"I'm sorry I didn't like it. I have a REAL PROBLEM with animal cruelty and the scene with the dolphin absolutely repulsed me. Seeing a bunch of pretty boy pubescents torturing a dolphin is NOT MY IDEA OF ENTERTAINMENT. That whole scene should have been cut from the movie. But even that act alone could not save this movie. And who is this Ryan Phillipe character anyways? Every movie i see him in is just plain awful. I call it the Ryan Phillipe curse. I am astounded my favorite director, Ridley Scott directed this movie. I will just pretend he didn't."
1,Common sense would of come in handy,This movie was really stupid. A bunch of hormonal teenage guys trown together on a boat does not appeal to me. The movie was a typical movie showing just how useless guys really are. They showed girls as nothing more than dumb airheads and sex toys. This movie did nothing for me at all. It had a bad boy who wasn't really as bad as every one thought. A wimp who wasn't as whimpy as every one thought. A boss who wasn't as bossy as every one thought. Did this movie have anything as it was meant to? How dumb can you get?
5,White Squal Movie,"THis movie teaches a lot about life! I think it's great especially if you have boys!SUsieMiami. ,Fl"
3,White Squall,"Lots of character development - action.Story was very cool but we are sailors, so any sailing movie is great.Jeff Bridges was OK as captain, but they could have chosen a better lead."
4,Excellent Movie - Excellent Book,"I never knew this movie existed until I read the new book ""White Squall - The Last Voyage of Albatross"". I loved the book and wanted to see all the visual elements described therein. The photography of the movie was excellent and what I had envisioned as I read the book. I was disappointed that the movie did not accurately describe what really happened during the time at sea and after the rescue. And I didn't care for the the portrayal of Skipper as somewhat of a Captain Bly. But that is Hollywood's way of making a great movie and they succeeded. This movie is well worth watching. The only delema I can see is whether to watch the movie first or read the book first, but I will leave that up to you."
4,This movie is worth seeing,"This is a really good movie and I recommend for everyone to see it. It has a lot of drama in it but it also has a good bit of action. I really like the movie and think it is a shame that a lot of people have never even heard of it. You should watch it, I know you will like it."
4,Good movie.,Excellent movie. Explains a lot about human nature. It has the good and the bad characters we meet in life.
1,umbrella base,This base was too light weight for my 9'umbrella. Sent it back.purchased a 65 pound weight base that will hold a 9'umbrella.
2,Umbrella Base,"Poor quality, filled with sand, water no matter what I used it was not heavy enough to hold umbrella. I would not recommend."
3,Just good.,"The base itself is alright once it's filled with water, but it HAS to be used with a table so the umbrella doesn't move around. There is no way to tighten the grip on the umbrella base. Overall, it's not a bad product for the price."
1,Not worth the money,"Cheap plastic umbrella holder, filled it with water, installed umbrella, tightened it against the pole, then two days later the wind yanked the umbrella out of the stand and broke the umbrellaI guess you get what you pay for, and this was quickly thrown in the trash"
1,Insufficient for a freestanding umbrella,"This product might do okay as a base below a table, but we had purchased it so that we could have a freestanding umbrella beside our inground pool. Fifteen minutes later, the first strong breeze of the day caused the plastic sleeve holding the umbrella to kink and fail - permanently compromised.We returned it to the hardware store we bought it from and paid an additional $14 for a more substantial (and more attractive) metal decorative stand, which has held up to all kinds of wind since then.I do suspect that this could be used with a table above it, so that the base isn't responsible to handle all of the wind's load, but that wasn't what we were hoping for."
2,"Umbrella, Umbrella, Please Stand Up!","I have not been able to get my umbrella to stand up in this base. I have used water, sand, and mud! It still bends at the neck and falls over. Contacted the company, and they were glad to send me another one, but it did the same thing. Maybe my umbrella is to big, weight wise, I don't know, but didn't have any luck."
2,Plastic Umbrella bases yuck!,We tried filling them with water at first that didn't work very well. So then we filled them with sand. That was a little better but the bases weren't heavy enough to hold the umbrellas upright in a steady breeze. We ended up getting rid of all of them and replacing them with preformed concrete bases. Those worked very well.
2,Not worth it.,"Definitely not worth the money, it will not hold the umbrella up unless it is in a table. Not meant to hold an umbrella without a table for support. This is the first time I have been disappointed with anything I ordered off of amazon.com."
3,Took a long time to get,This product took a long time to get. Shipping was over 10 days. It was exactly as described but it turns out it did not meet my needs. It was not stable enough to hold our umbrella. Not the company's fault - we ordered the wrong thing.
3,Think about sand,"Remember, it is very important that you fill the base with sand or water in order for it to support the umbrella. I liked it, and I would recommend it."
4,Convienent umbrella stand,"Very light weight as shipped, but can be filled with water or sand to make a good umbrella support. The friction clamp for the umbrella shaft was a little difficult to get lined up."
4,painstakingly artful,"The kalingas are a proud people. One author withstood 4 months of pain and gain of course, to write a book about a tribe, nay a community; not even - a nation!The Philippines would be better of as a nation to read this art of a book, and learn from the customs and practices of an older civilization - close to 5,000 years old (my fact); their songs and wine and love and adventure deserves a niche in the heart of Filipinos, to help undo centuries of colonial mindedness (the effect of ""liberal theology"" as conspired to by the catholic leaders in colonizing the country) (you - [spanish] clerics think we don't know what you did to our culture? Ha Ha)Back to James skibo: James skibo, may your tribe increase- but one thing. Stay there longer (than 4 months)for some real-life imersion please. And do another book on the ""budong"" which means peace pact but more than that - it is a government!"
3,"Not exactly like the picture, but does the same job.","The one in the picture looks interesting, and my old one was getting a bit frayed anyway, so I added it to my existing order. When it arrived, it was exactly like my old one, which is exactly like EVERY other one out there. The handle is not ""ergonomic"" (if that is the right word, maybe ""contoured"" is better) and the bristles are not as shown. All in all, it does the job, just like my last one, but I probably wouldn't have ordered it had i know it was the same as the one I bought at my local sports store, for the same price!"
5,One to read over and over again,"I bought this book without ever having heard of it or the author; but my son was having a dragon birthday theme, so I took a chance. What wonderful luck. It is good for children age 4 to 40! We have read it numerous times and the chapters provide comfortable break points as well. This book stirs the imagination and keeps the reader and listener interested!"
5,perfect transaction,Bought this old book on a recommendation from a friend. I am a librarian at a elementary school and the kids love it.
5,Great first chapter book,"This book grabs the attention of kids 4-7, which is pretty rare. It's a great story and an absolute classic. It can be read again and again."
3,Could have been better,"Not every childrens book can be The Wizard of Oz, Charlotte's Web or James and the Giant Peach. My son and I liked this one, but I'm sure within a few months we will have forgotten what is was about. It just wasn't very memorable."
3,Great album but I did not need two disc 1's,Ordered in good faith but I received a 2 disc set containing two disc one's. I waited too long to complain.
3,Half a glass is better than none_,"This was supposed to contain 2 CDs. It did, but two copies of CD #1, and NO copy of CD #2! I didn't discover this immediately. I'm happy to have what I have, but would be happier if CD#2 had been included rather than a duplicate of CD#1. I'm sure Amazon had no way of knowing!"
1,DO NOT BUY not rap.,This is not the former No Limit rapper T-Bo. It is some lame ass rock band. They are not even good for a band. DO NOT BUY if you are expecting the white rapper. Look for 'Before No LImit' & 'Firecracker.' This cd is not worth even $0.01.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Unless you are buying this product to measure body fat percent, these are the most undependable scales that I can recall using. It is routinely off by as much as 12 pounds from one reading to the next. This is true even when the time between readings is just a couple of minutes. I have to go to the local YMCA to get an accurate reading - which I was hoping to avoid when I purchased the scales in the first place.In addition, a new 9 volt alkaline battery only lasted 5 weeks in these scales.On the positive side, I will say that the body fat monitor gives consistent results, and the LED readout is readily visible."
5,scale is great,This scale was one of the best we ever owned. The battery lasted 14 years and was never replaced. The weight was always accurate. Too bad it has been discontinued. We loved this scale and tried to find new parts after my boys broke it wrestling around.
3,Ok Shimmer,I used another smashbox shimmer before and really liked the natural looking shimmer that wasn't too sparkly. This was a little diappointing for me. I had hoped for a little more shimmer and a little less powder.
4,Descriptive and informative,"This book was written by a journalist who interviewed all the siblings of several families. The descriptions of the people that she met were well-drawn. The author also outlined some of the concepts that have been put forth by psychologists studying sibling relationships and character development. These were interesting, and went beyond the most usual system of birth order characterization.My intent in reading this book was to gain some insight on some pernicious troubles that persevere in my relationships with my own siblings. This book didn't seem very helpful in that light. A few of the relationships had some undercurrents, or outright problems, but there wasn't a lot of narrative about solving the problems. The problematic relationships seemed to be glossed over by the subjects themselves, so that there wasn't even any material that gave me a chance to see problems similar to my own from the other perspective."
1,I didn't like it at all.,it was boring it didn't talk about the door that they found it just used a lot of long words to say what we already know. I advise you not to spend your money on this book!
4,The Miracle of Zin,"This is a terrific book for wine lovers. It tells the complete story of the develpment of Zinfandel, the uniquely American wine, with humor and erudition. I learned a lot about my favorite wine and enjoyed every page of the education!"
3,A decent rap album from Dallas's best rapper,"This album never really rises to anything great. Mr. Pookie remixes some of his best such as ""Texas"" and ""Stoney Crook,"" but they are just not very good and simply do not approach the raw power and impact of the original. The other original material on this album is not very good, and the music and beat is particularly mediocre.Not a very good effort from an otherwise solid and intersting artist."
4,Hannah's Garden the best book in the libray.,Hannah's Garden is the best book in the libray at my school and in my towns too.
5,Excellent 'atmospheric' metal,"Some would say that all these extreme metal bands going 'commercial rock' is another trend just like glam was. If so, it's the best trend I've heard in a long time. Entwine is an excellent band who started out doing brutal death metal and quickly morphed into an excellent rock/metal band. I would roughly compare their sound to a mix of Amorphis, Katatonia, Lacuna Coil, and Radiohead. Yes, their vocalist sounds uncannily like a certain vocalist from Radiohead. Its a very cool sound that works well with the music that they do. Every song stands out on its own and they show just the right amount of variety without sounding disjointed. A very good listen and a band I'm eager to keep following for years to come."
2,Intensely boring,"It's so aggressively boring that it can't even be background music. Lo-fi in the sense that it's fuzzy as hell and filled with tuneless shouting. I've tried to listen to this thing multiple times, I've tried skipping to different tracks, I can never last more than 10 minutes."
4,A Must Have,"If you want to know what D.C. punk is about, buy this. Great music from real musicians. In other words, people less concerned with vanity and commercial success, and more concerned with the music that they're playing and their fans. If you don't already know - it's time that you did."
2,please explain why this is so great...,"maybe i'm just narrow minded, but i find this to be tedious. i prefer any of mackaye's other bands over this. the songs on this are just slow and pretentious in my opinion, but sadly this is the best thing i have heard by fugazi. i wish i could like this band, but everytime i sit down and try to listen to them i get distracted."
1,Pedestrian,Do not waste your time or money with this one. The music is very ordinary and pedestrian. The first three or four songs were such a bore I turned it off and never listened to it again. Do yourself a favor and stick to 13 Songs or Minor Threat's Complete Discography for Ian MacKaye's best work. This definately is not it.
5,There's no place like home (so where am I?),"In 1986, while bemaoning the death of Minor threat, hearing that Bad Brains had broken up (rumor had it that HR had died) and learning to like Metallica, my friend from DC came up with an incredible tape of demos from Ian's new band, Fugazi. The tape became a local classic, dubbed and copied untill it was hardly audible. We had the stupendous Fugazi shake the floorboards of our house twice in '87 and '88. One of my favorite live bands of all time, for sure, their studio albums always pale in comparison. I'm glad to read reviews from all the people who love ""13 Songs,"" but all I can say to them is ""damn, you should've heard that demo tape..."" Well, this album sounds as close to the raw fury of that demo as you're going to find on Amazon.com, so you might as well buy it."
3,Decently Funny,"Though not as good as the much funnier ""Joe Dirt"", this movie was good for some laughs, though not of the all-out side-splitting variety. It's actually more of a story about how having a family and being loved is more important than fame or money."
4,Entertaining and often funny,"Alright. I knew this movie wasn't going to be amazing. Infact, I am not a huge fan of David Spade. His last few movies were brutal, but this one looked like it had potential-so I bought a ticket. I was surprised. Spade does his usual corny and mildly funny act, but other actors make it work, and I found myself laughing quite a bit. If you go into this movie thinking its going to stink, it's gonna stink. But if you give it a chance and not expecting too much, you may be pleasantly surprised as I was. The end credit sequence with Gary Coleman is worth the price of admission. Altough formulaic and cheesy, Spade gets it done finally. This movie isn't hilarious laugh out loud every second, and it barely gets 4 stars from me-(should be 3.5-3.75 stars), but delivers and makes you laugh. You could wait for it to come out in video/dvd, but with the lackof any good movies this september, its a good bet."
1,For Future Golden Turkey Awards,"Dickie Roberts is good fun if you like yours served up with the least amount of comedic talent. This film is just astonishingly bad. I can't believe the positive reviews here... I want to get on the shill list so I can get my payola money too!Most comedians getting movie gigs risk winding up on a painful slide downward. It's partly because of the limited vision of producers finding suitable story vehicles, and partly because good comedy seems to come from borderline personalities. There's something about movie success that too often gentrifies and dilutes a comic's edge. Likewise, Spade is too comfortable with being mediocre and he lacks the talent to hold up a film by himself.You get the same comedy value out of staying home and watching a TV sitcom, if not more... 'Makes a re-run of Mr. Ed look like the most inspired side splitting experience on the planet in comparison.If you haven't guessed, I hate, hate, hated this film!"
1,"Not Funny, completely pointless","When I saw the previews for this movie, I thought it looked alright. It was definately the worst David Spade movie I've ever seen and the jokes weren't at all funny. It was about a former child star who really wants to get his career back on track by starring in an upcoming Rob Reiner film. In order to get his acting motivation back, Spade's character, Dicky, decides to live with a random family and re-live his childhood. This is really a kids movie with corny humor that only someone under the age of 12 could appreciate. Don't waste your money."
1,IF YOU'RE A SPADE FAN DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE,"I like David Spade and I thought JOE DIRT was his best movie. This one is terrible. I don't think I laughed once. Spade plays a washed up actor who decides to pay a family to give him the childhood he never head, so he will have the experience to play a roll in a Rob Reiner film. Spade cracks lame jokes throughout and ends up with the family's mother. (The father was a creep and Spade behaved himself throughout, so no need to shelter the kiddies.)The only good thing about this film was the appearance of former child stars like Leif Garrett, Danny Boniducci, and Barry Williams. If they had had larger parts the movie might have been funnier. At the end during the credits a large group of child stars assemble to sing a ""We Are the World"" type song. The only reason I gave this POS a star.Don't waste your time. See JOE DIRT instead."
1,No,"This movie was the dumbest ""comedy"" i have not fully watched. My girlfriend and i left the theater about halfway through after not laughing once. He was painfully unfunny. Too bad Chris Farley died, because his career isnt going too well without him. If anything, get Tommy Boy instead."
4,Dickie Roberts,This is a very funny movie and is great for middle agers because it has so many child stars in it.
3,What a piece of shizit!,"Okay, if your script uses 1,000 year old jokes as a source of comedy, then you might need to call in some ghost writers, some great and powerful Ozes, something. The joke I'm referring to is, of course, the dead rabbit. I heard that in second grade.And what is up with Spade? After striking freaking gold in ""Joe Dirt,"" this movie, which had so much potential for good comedy, drowned in sentimental drivel. In ""Dirt"" it was okay for him to be sweetly sentimental because he was a moron. But here...I just don' t know. It was cheese corn, bad cheese corn.Watch out for the following jokes: ""Insane in the membrane,"" the little girl doing the hip slapping little rhyme, the dead rabbit, and pretty much everything else.Come back to us, David, you and Sandler need to relearn the value of a good fart joke.This review did not help one single, solitary soul"
2,"Took a while to get funny, but it was decent...","This was a very weak comedy. I mean, the previews made it look funnier than it actually was, but it still had its scenes. It just took forever for the movie to get to them. It drug for about thirty minutes. After that, things picked up a bit, but still, it could've been better. I wasn't expecting TOO much anyways. I loved ""Joe Dirt"" - yes, I said 'loved' - but this was a bit of a disappointment.If you're in the mood for some dumb humor, go right on and rent it when it's released on video."
3,"""Are You Nucking Futs?""","David Spade is Dickie, a sitcom child star who never shook his signature catch phrase. J. J. had ""Dy-No-Mite!"" The Fonz, ""Sit on it!"" And Dickie: ""Are you nucking futs?""Early on we learn that Dickie used to be the king of sitcoms, but is a modern day moron. He is oblivious to the fact that his time has come and gone.I won't bother you with the plot line; you can watch the movie for yourself. But I will say that David Spade delivers an ""allright"" performance. The jokes are sometimes lame. It's childish humour, so it does not appeal to adults, but adults shouldn't let their children watch it, as this immature jokes are delivered with launguage most of the time. And believe it or not, the main character learns something about himself, and believe it or not... there IS a moral!""Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star"" isn't worth a purchase, but it's a good rent."
5,Had to have DVD,"I enjoyed the story because it had faces I hadn't seen in a while. Also, because of the care the family took of the main character. Had to have the DVD."
3,"Fun, Retro Comedy","Fun, retro, comedy that unfortunately bases itself on bad over acting to carry the plot along. Was that, no, David Spade acting? Yes, once in a while David actually stops the ""stand up comedy routine"" and appears to have, uh, ""emotional feelings"". I don't care what other people say, the movie is a fun ride as long as you can overlook the occasional, if not frequent, ""acting school drop out"" performance by some of the actors. It delivers some good laughs and that's what it's all about.Bottom Line:Great surround sound. Lots of child actor 60's, 70's and 80's actor ""cameo"" appearances."
4,I Loved It!!!!,"This movie made me laugh, laugh, laugh. If you grew up watching all those old 70's sitcoms, you will love watching them in Dickie Roberts. There are some absolutely hilarious scenes where Dickie is trying to re-live his chidhood. Remember the Slip 'n Slide? Learning to ride your bike? You'll die watching Dickie learn...."
4,not as good as joe dirt but good,critics claim that this movie was funnier than joe dirt but i didnt think so there were some funny parts in it but a lot of it was serious. joe dirt was a LOT better than this movie. i thought the brady bunch singing part was cool but it wasnt as funny as it was hyped up to be.
3,So So,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it really just isn't that funny. I am a huge David Spade fan and loved Joe Dirt but I felt like this movie could have been much better. The idea is really good but it is poorly executed and you feel like the actors are trying too hard for a laugh. It does have maybe 4 or 5 parts that you will probably laugh at, but for the most part you will be trying to figure out who all the grown up, former child stars in the movie are. I recommend watching it before you buy it."
5,girl to the rescue!,"Wendy Wright is a chubby middle-schooler who avidly consumes her twice-weekly local newspaper against her mother's better judgement. Wendy enjoys all parts of THE BUGLE, & makes sure never to miss her favorite comic strip, except she's never paid much attention to the advertisers.When THE BUGLE's headlines announces that Moffat Corner's only newspaper is in trouble & unless it finds more advertisers or a buyer, it's going to become as extinct as dinosaurs.That's when Wendy goes into action.Rebeccasreads recomends SAVIORS OF THE BUGLE as a good & interesting read, with some unusual ideas & fun along the way."
1,A poorly written disappointment,"This book disappointed me in several ways. First because in too many places, I found the writing to be awkward and somewhat amateurish. Clues were dropped with clangs that reverberated with the same resonance as a concrete block dropped into a galvanized washtub. Taylor Morgan, the protaganist of the book, blunders through her investigation, and solves the mystery herself only because the investigating officers, both State Troopers and NTSB investigators, are depicted as boorish, thick-headed sexists incapable of recognizing a smoking gun when it's pointed at them."
2,A waste of money,We bought this and we gave it away. The film might have been alright if it were not for the language. Hollywood threw in the unnecessary foul language in order to appeal to the trash of society obviously but it is of no interest to us.
1,Book,Bought it for my husband and he didn't read it. Should not have bothered with it. Thought he was interested in subject
4,Very good late dc music,"I agree with much of the review. I do not own the release, but own all of the original material and the material is good. However, I disagree that Fugazi fans will enjoy it. If I were to drop most of the material from the release into a bucket, I would compare it to Rites of Spring and Embrace. The first album doesn't compare to anyone *IMO* but the later releases were just different, more similar to feel as Embrace (but not as good).Excellent taste of what was happening in DC in that time. If only dischord and sammich would team up and release the Becoming less.. and Lunchmeat material...aaargh!"
3,A soap opera,"I enjoyed the first book I read by the author,( The Trespassers) but can't say much about this one. It was more like a soap opera with little real action and jumped from place to place so I lost interest in a few spots. Another thing that bothered me was the repeated attemps to make Geoge Armstrong Custer a super hero when any reader of the indian wars or civil war knows he was like Patton of WW 11, a egotistical commander with little regard for his troops. A poor tactition as proven by his last battle. It adds nothing to the book except taking up pages. I have 2 more I havn't read yet and hope they are better than this one."
2,Stunning.....NOT!,"I had high hopes for this book after reading such glowing reviews, however, I was disappointed. The problem with it is that this author is L-A-Z-Y. She used the word ""Stunning"" or some form of the word over and over (and over and over...you get the idea.) The two main characters were ""Stunned"" so many times I began to think they must be using tasers on each other. Overuse of a word or phrase causes it to lose its effectiveness, and becomes distracting to the reader. There are multitudes of wonderfully descriptive words in the English language, authors, use them!"
3,"Great concert, but you'll want more","Both new and well-traveled Avalon fans alike will enjoy this concert collection, but unfortunately you'll be left wanting more. The DVD claims to be approximately 58 minutes long, but only contains around 45 minutes of footage. It's a mystery where the other ten minutes went. The filming is great quality, and the vocals sound great (which is expected). The disappointment comes in the little things-- a black-out between almost every song, which gives the concert very little flow, and it just seems too short for an advertised concert DVD. There are no ""clunkers"" or songs that are unenjoyable, but the length of ""Testify to Love: Avalon Live in Concert"" slims down and doesn't share enough of this group's top-notch material."
3,Atypical of Chris,"I was introduced to Chris Rice a few months back, and I was very intrigued by the mellow and honest songs. I grew accustomed to a particular style that I enjoyed very much.And then I was given Smell the Color 9. It's just not the same thing. It's not a bad album, but it's not the same Chris Rice I appreciated so much from Past the Edges and Deep Enough to Dream. The sound is so different, and the words less striking to me.I guess as a CD in general, I'd give it a 4. But as a Chris Rice CD, I'd give it a 3."
2,One of a few,"I bought this cd for the title track. Chris's songwriting in my opinion was a little weak on this album. I have heard other stuff he has done and it was great. But for when this came out, the title cut was really hot on the airwaves."
5,PRAISE GOD FOR CHRIS RICE!,"I bought this CD because I had heard the song Face of Christ on the radio. I hadn't heard the rest of the CD. Now I have and I love it!! Chris says all the things that I have thought and wondered. When I listen to Chris I feel like I can almost see heaven. Questions for Heaven is musically and spiritually a joy, your heart sings along. I give praise to my Father in Heaven for Chris Rice's musical ability. CAN'T QUIT PLAYING THIS CD, THANK YOU CHRIS!!"
4,Excellent device,Bought this product for a client. Works wonderfully. Able to get up and at 'em without relying on a staff member. Client had it plugged in and ready to go in a matter of minutes.
4,Clarity 600 Wake Assure Alarm Clock With Bed Shaker,"Shaking alarm clocks are notorious for breaking. This one has not broken, but I did have to add a different bed shaker to make it strong enough for my son."
2,The Box Lies,"The tag line on the box is ""The Alarm Clock That's Guaranteed To Wake You Up!"" however the manual clearly states that the manufacture is not responsible for the alarm clocks failure to work.This Alarm Clock WILL NOT WORK IN A POWER OUTAGE you can use a backup battery and it will keep the time current however it will not display the time or sound the alarm during a power outage.This Alarm Clock is SEVERELY overpriced. Take your $50 and spend it on an Alarm Clock from a reputable manufacture."
4,Good book for the serious student,"This book is great for the serious student of psychicdevelpoment, but is no book for a person simply wishing tobecome a ""mind reader"". It contains heplful information,and diffrent exercises to increase your psychic ability.Be warned however, if you have no intention of dedicatingan amount of time to this or working hard on the exercises,you might want to try a diffrent book instead."
4,Ok Book,"This is an ok book to learn of psychic works. But it lacks much dangers and ups/downs of psychic developments, as many psychic works books do. She tries to make the book fun to read and learn, and teach as best as she could. Which she lists some low level tools and fun games. It just she was not fully intune with her psychic nature to know more how and why, and follow the mind to teach the way it should be taught. Other then taht, it is a good book for a starter.For those who want to be psychic, caution! I was born as clairsentient, and had many years of expereince with the unknwown and unseen, and being psychic has its ups and downs. It is no fun and games, it is a spiritual life. If you want to practice to be at your true psychic state, be aware there are things you can not control, evil beings that you may have to fight, and that true psychics serve all sentient beings, healers and holy ones for all on earth and off. Abuse it, you will suffer spiritually."
5,Mitch Altogether,"The CD comes w/ the DVD. Hedberg's terrific and this 2nd CD is better than Strategic Grill Locations since the background bass is gone. The DVD seems like a last minute rush job by Comedy Central. It's about 45 minutes long but the two taped shows both get repeated, the Premium Blend NY show, and the show from the Palace in LA. It's a total let down which isn't helped any by the fact that the DVD does not include an intro or menu screen. It's straight to the concerts and these are 15 minute jobs. The one thought that comes to mind is, ""I've been ripped off."" Thankfully, the CD more than makes up for that promotional garbage.RAR"
4,Hilarious but somewhat flawed,"I've now seen Mitch in all his efforts I think, from his first stand-up bits to his developing the somewhat stoned delivery that made him famous. He didn't need a schtick but it does work somewhat, his laid-back delivery is reminiscent of Steven Wright and his jokes come nearly as fast as Wright's. It's somewhat more adult material and his stoned demeanor gets wearing after awhile but this is still one of my favorite comedy CDs. The DVD is also great and you can see him progressing over time, which only makes his early passing worse since he might have been even better today. Getting this set will give you most of his material in one place and nearly all of his funniest stuff so I highly recommend it if you like Steven Wright, enjoy zingers and one-liners given in a somewhat deadpan delivery and don't mind the way he speaks as if he's high all the time."
5,Original and intelligent stupidity,"This is the first comedy CD I've ever bought. Why? Because the majority of stand up comedians bore the hell out of me. Mitch Hedberg tells intelligent jokes about everyday stupidity; in other words, he makes you think about the most inane things and laugh about how obviously ridiculous they are! I've played this for pretty much everyone I know, and I must say that Mitch has a pretty impressive following in Duluth, Minnesota. It comes with a free DVD, too! Listen. Watch. Be extremely amused."
4,almost great,Mitch was on his way to being great. You can hear it on this cd. Too bad he will never achieve what would have been his. RIP
2,Disappointing follow-up to his masterpiece,"My favourite comedy album of all time is Mitch's Strategic Grill Locations but this does not come near it's standard. His delivery has changed and seems very stylised whereas on Strategic it just seemed like Mitch was being himself on-stage all the time. This is considerably shorter than his first album and the quality of the material isn't great either. I really wanted to laugh but I only laughed at a couple of jokes and smiled through the rest. I was double-over listing to Strategic. The audience interaction was great on that and it didn't seem like Mitch was taking it too seriously. This album comes across as a ""show"", rather than Mitch just fooling around with some people present. He was a great talent and I would have loved more from Mitch but he has left a legacy of a truly great comedy album and this so-so follow up. Whenever I need an instant laugh I just stick on Strategic Grill Locations. Thanks Mitch wherever you are!"
2,MITCH ON SPEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Mitch's first CD was Brilliant!! I got a lot of my friends into Mitch because of that CD. However, I don't know what the heck happened to him on this one. The jokes are great, but the delivery is flat out terrible. It seems like he had about 30 cups of coffee and is trying to rush the laughs instead of just letting them happen. I saw him at the Hard Rock Live in Orlando and he just rushed the jokes there as well. I'm still not giving up on him though, however, he's got to change soon or I'm out. Along with many others! I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIS FIRST CD, which you can get on www.mitchhedberg.net. It is one of the funniest stand-ups I've ever heard. With regards to this one though, I lent it to a friend and don't care if I get it back. MITCH, IF YOU READ THIS PLEASE SLOW IT DOWN ON STAGE!!"
2,"Wow, huge disappointment.","I loved Mitch's first cd and the Comedy Central special, so I was looking forward to this one for some time. What a letdown; he sounds totally different and not as funny. Part of what made Hedberg fantastic was his laid-back, casual tone and delivery. On this, he sounds like an angry, cursing speed freak. There's no sublety; he just rushes through his act.What happened?"
2,explicit language,"I was sorry to find out about his passing and only heard of him through Sirius radio on the ""Family Comedy"" station. When I bought a few CD's I didn't pay much attention to the ""explicit language"" description. It was so explicit, I couldn't hear the jokes for the language and had to return both CD's. I'm sure he would have been just as funny without the ""explicit language"" and feel like I missed some good humor smothered in bad language...too bad."
1,TERRIBLE,"The reviews on this CD made this guy seem like a rock star of comedy. Not sure if these people can actually hear.I listened for about 5 minutes and shut it off. The delivery was AWFUL, he talked too fast, and the jokes were subpar....at best."
4,Some pieces of the puzzle are missing.,"Mitch Hedberg........Comedy Central commercials say ""He stands on the outside of comedy, critics have hailed him as the ""second coming of Comedy"" Time magazine said he was the next Jerry Seinfeld. I don't know about all those labels, the only label I have is.... the dude is funny. So why not a 5 star? Mitch switched up his style in this CD. The thing thats unique abut Hedberg, is he's slooow, acquired style and delivery. If you hear a Hedberg joke, and tried to tell it to a friend, you would look stupid. The funny part really isent the punch line, its the after joke. ""I always wanted to have a briefcase handcuff to my wrist"" That joke is stupid, but its the way mitch handles it thats funny. (the after joke) I felt this CD lost a little of that, it doesn't seem as laid back, and the delivery is spead up. Don't get me wrong this is still a great CD, The material is still very Unique, and there's nothing thats going to make your eye lids heavy."
3,Too many drug references.,This guy is a talent but uses too many drug references. Some bits are very funny. He is who he is.
4,w00t,"I am a big Mitch Hedberg fan, but I liked the first CD better myself. This newer CD has no pauses and is very fast paced, which I wan't too big of a fan of. It was a lot better when he had tons of pauses on the first CD. But, getting the negatives out of the way, the CD is still one of the funniest things I've ever heard. Mitch is so dead on on almost everything. I definitely recommend this CD."
5,Mitch is an extremely funny man,Mitch all together is truly a great dvd and cd. I watch and listen to them both over and over.
4,Great set!,I really enjoyed this CD as it was extremely funny. If you are already a fan you will probably love it. If you aren't a fan check out the clips first.
3,Losing His Touch,"Indeed, his first CD is considerably better. Lots of old material on this one delivered with a new and speeded up sense of timing. Sometimes, no often, it just doesn't work. Part of what makes Mitch funny is his delivery. How many comedians can make this joke funny? ""I haven't slept for ten days...That would be too long."" I dunno, but not too many. Lots of profanity that is simply superfluous on this CD. He doesn't need it if it doesn't add to the joke.Mitch is one of the most talented comedians I have heard in years. His mind works in mysterious and remarkably funny ways. But I have a feeling he is trying to be something he's not on the CD. Save your money and get the first one."
4,"this one's for free, mitch","I'm gonna tell you this one for free.bro- you're funny. and charismatic- but what do I care. Dude- your funnier on t.v.. your humor doesn't need all that cussin'. I swear like a drunk uncle, so it ain't that- I'm just saying that your vibe of hilarity is more so when it ain't all tied up in all that cussin'. cussin' that isn't integral to the riff, is lazy and distracting.understand, hippy, I've listened to this cd- both actually- I think the most recent is funnier, but the bass on the first one was dope...I've listened to this thing about a dozen times in 3 weeks- It's f**kin' hilarious, but do what I say. clean it up and go to the next level. what are you, redd fox?I'm a fan of few, but one of you.peace, dw"
3,Mitch what's going on,"i've only got one thing to say about this cd-dvd set, it's not good. first off Mitch man what's going on?please lay of the caffine. Your first cd was so funny it never gets old. your new one is to fast and it sounds like you've got cold because you keep snorting through your nose.second your dvd isn't too great either for two reasons. one you can get more than 3/4 of it off of your website and two it's not that much.come on Mitch. slow down on stage, you're not a sell out yet."
5,Buy it for the DVD,"This CD and DVD are great. The uncut version of Mitch's special on the DVD alone is worth the price of admission. Usually the ""DVD included"" means a few skits of material but this one actually has the Comedy Central Special in the ""aired"" and ""uncut"" versions. On the uncut version he goes on for awhile after the special was supposed to be over. The crowd was ""late-arriving"" as far as getting into Mitch's style. Mitch was great and everyone should have an opportunity to experience his unique and thoughtful material."
4,Oooohh man...,"Okay, Mitch Hedburg is simply one of the best pun-oriented comics out there. This CD is awesome for the car and trips. The DVD is pretty cool too but it doesn't compare to the actual CD. Its very well-thought out, on the spot, and hilarious. He's probabaly the smartest and funniest stoner you'll ever meet. This CD guarantees you'll quote his lines with your friends. Its just way fun. End of story."
5,BIG T,"I LOVE PASTOR TROY HE IS THE BEST RAPPER. ALL HIS CDS WERE GOOD. LIKE WE READY, FACE OFF, AND FACE OFF 2."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A bizarre fever-dream of a movie, Blue Velvet succeeds in its attempts to shock and provides several memorable scenes, but the glossy exterior hides its lack of interesting characters and a soul."
1,"This movie was BAD with a capital ""B""","Some have found this movie to be daringly shocking. The only shocking thing that I found about this movie is that some many great actors let themselves participate in such a bad movie. At the start of this pointless film, it seems interesting and full of suspence, but it soon becomes overly melodramatic and the plot becomes boring. If you like dry, poorly made movies that have no qualities of redemption, this is the movie for you. If you have any amount of self respect, stay far away from this film."
1,Weird film,"Blue Velvet has got to be one of the strangest films I have ever seen. It started off o.k. but when we first see frank booth it just gets weirder and weirder. The film also suffers from bad script. The acting in the film is very poor expect Dennis Hopper.There are so many films like this and I can't understand why people think this one is so special. I was really looking forward to watching this when I bought the DVD but after watching it I felt cheated into buying a poor film.Overall bad film, bad acting and bad script. People who appeciate those three should steer clear."
1,"Unseemly, Nasty and Rank","If your taste runs towards the morose, then David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"" is for you. Unfortunately, there is little in this widely acclaimed film that makes it watchable or enjoyable. It's a depressing exercise in non-humanity, and is better left on the shelf. The director shocks us into thinking his characters have a real raison d'etre, when in fact there is little to explain why they behave the way they do. A waste of talent, time and critical support."
4,Definitely a nightmare.,"The icy, but strange Lynch mood enters Blue Velvet from the very beginning. Starting off semi-squeaky clean, things start darkening as the main character, Kyle MacLachlan, begins to discover, of course, wierd things in his hometown. After a meeting with Isabella Rossellini's character, MacLachlan begins a downward spiral into an evil world of desparation, wickedness and corruption. Blue Velvet's 'plot' is much easier to follow than Lynch's Lost Highway. However, it's a bumpy mental road for those who try to figure it all out. One of Lynch's best."
5,She wears...,"..Blue Velvet..and so goes the title song. Bkue Velvet is a kind of movie that, when it's watched on a surface is nothing more then a simplistic detective thriller. But it is so much more, if you view this film with an open mind and a keen eye you will be blown away by it's meriad of subliminal metaphors and cryptic symbolism. A movie that will leave you feeling a bit uneasy, yet satisfied, you will feel somethin after you see Blue Velvet. David Lynch has a way about his films that draws you in and never lets go, you are no longer sitting comfotably in your living room chair, but instead you are thrust in to take on Denis Hopper's pure wrath and evil and to weep for Donny..Blue Velvet will move you, wether you want it to, or not."
3,BLUE RIBBON PRESENTATION,"Boy comes back from college. Finds High School darling. Finds amputated ear in field. Calls Police. Hides in woman's closet. Watches her and her pissed-off boyfriend have weird sex. Tells his girlfriend. She tells Daddy. Daddy is a cop. College-boy falls for the victim. She is old enough to be his mother (HINT,HINT). Psychopath beats up boy. College-boy decides to revenge. High School girlfriend sings weird song about people. Yellow Man sets up sting. Psychopath gets shot in the head. Boy and girl marry. OH! PARDON ME! I WAS TALKIN' ABOUT MY LIFE LAST NIGHT. This movie is pretty good."
3,Dissappointing,"This movie wasn't near as disturbing as I had hoped. I was actually bored during quite a few scenes. It would have been better if I hadn't expected so much, from reading all sorts of reviews. I'm actually watching the end of it right now while I'm writing this review, that's how interested I am. lol Oh, well."
3,Good..Bad.. Ugly...,"This film, in my opinon will entertain you. But to put it up there with some of my other four and five star film's would be wrong.The story line is pretty good, the acting did for the most part, carry the film for as good as it was written.I do think that the director tried to accomplish too much in too many area's.If they had just stuck with the story line and amplified that, it may of done better with the general public as well.But, as I said, it will keep your interest, and you should enjoy it for what it is... "" A good movie"".. not a great or an awesome movie..."
1,Waste of Time,"I was really looking forward to seeing this one. I had heard nothing but great things about it, especially Dennis Hopper's disturbing portrayal. Now my only question is, why did Hopper agree to be associated with this trash? The film makes a bold-but unsuccessful-attempt at delving just under the surface of small-town America. The result is a convoluted, over-acted, downright laughable piece of grade-A garbage. The only reason I gave it one star is that there was no choice for ZERO. A whodunit? How about a whocareswhodunit? Don't waste your time with this. There are more exciting and/or fulfilling things to do in life, like licking stamps or folding socks."
2,Get Mullholand Dr. instead,I like Lynch. Dune-good. Wild At Heart-good. Twin Peaks-good. Mullholland Dr.-great. Blue Velvet-BAD. Now most Lynch fans would hate me. They would say i dont know what i'm talking about. Well i dont know why but i almost couldnt finish this film. It was just awful. It was werid and some parts were interesting but in the whole there are other lynch films i would rather watch. I think Mullholland Dr. is his best picture. It requries many viewings in order to figure it out so i would suggest gettin that instead. I do think that this movie is definatley worth a watch. I just think it was one of lynch's poorer films.
1,Horrifying Rubbish,"This film is a terrible waste of celluloid. The cinematography is extremely overrated and utterly pretentious. It splatters colour and various ""unique"" images in an effort as to appear creative. Subpar performances all around, except for Dennis Hopper who had some moments. Isabella Rosellini was laughable as a depraved femme fatale, totally laughable. It was a film that relied on its ""weirdness"" as the selling point, and as the vehicle on which to convince the viewer that this piece of garbage is somehow a good film. The so-called weirdness grew tired and banal, because it was obnoxiously prententious and self-indulgent. Highest Recommendation to avoid."
2,Dennis Hopper swears a lot.,"David Lynch is a very unconventional storyteller and filmmaker. There is nothing wrong with that, but one must at least make sense of the story. In 'Blue Velvet', Lynch explores the sexual underworld of a clean-cut suburban town. A young man finds some suspicious things happening in an apartment complex. What he finds out is quite distrubing; Dennis Hopper has a fetish for blue velvet and performes some bizzare sex acts. It was interesting, but the story is ruined by Hopper using the f-word for every other word. The young man falls in love with the victim of Hopper's sex acts. Other than that the story is not very interesting. The characters are more like robots and once again there are scenes that are obviously stolen from Alfred Hitchcock, specifically 'Vertigo'."
2,Blue Velvet,Words really can't describe this movie. Was relatively bored throughout and thought the acting lacked incredibly. At the end I felt like it was just one big waste of time.
1,Bad bad movie,One of the worst movies I ever saw. Dennis Hopper must have been on drugs to have acted in this movie. It was crap from beginning to end.
1,Don't waste your time.,"After seeing Mulholland Drive, I figured Blue Velvet and Lost Highway might be interesting as well. Boy was I wrong. Those two movies were horrible wastes of time and money. The acting was extremely poor, and the Angelo Badalamenti music is not only terrible, but plays at all the wrong times. David Lynch doesn't have a clue.Buy something else if you want a good movie."
1,Unadvisable,"I thought I was going to see something of Roy Orbinson. It was only in the title of the name. I could not watch it when it became vulgar with offensive material. It is too bad to have a good story with great actors lowering its potentially good quality with such degrading vulgarity. There are better ways of getting this aspect of the story across with such depiction. Silly me, I should have checked the rating. I ""assumed"" it safe as it would involve our beloved Roy Orbinson. I was sadly and horridly disappointed and cannot in conscience recommend it to anyone at anytime. By the way,I destroyed the tape in good conscience. Watch at your own eternal risk."
5,Disturbingly Great,"What really strikes me about David Lynch is his insane sense of humor and juxtaposition of funny and sick, for example having a puppy and a baby playing in front of a stroke victim, Dennis Hopper's polite way of ""showing a neighbor a good time"", and on a side note, the importance of Pabst Blue Ribbon. I also enjoy the simplistic cliches about good vs.very bad things and the hope that some day the birds will return and everything will be good again."
2,Great movie but surprisingly poor transfer,"I won't say anything more on the movie. it's a ""love it or hate it"" kind of movie. But I have to point out the very poor transfer. It's full of digital artifacts and my dvd player confirms this by showing a transfer rate that is an average of 4-4.5 and drops very often under 2.5. this is really poor and unacceptable from a ""Special edition"" version. I guess they had to use such a high compression to fit all the extra material. but I'd rather watch a good quality dvd than some dull extras."
3,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I watched this movie tonight and was a little disappointed by the story. I read all of the reviews, looked at the plot line and thought it would be a good movie to watch. I was a little bored through the movie because it traveled kinda slow and was a little disjointed. At times, it was very boring to me. Maybe in it's time when it was made, it probably was a milestone in movie making. It is now outdated with it's story line and ""director's tricks"" which made the movie very confusing. It you want to see a movie along this line that also has a ""mystery"" to it, see ""StrangeLand""."
2,whoatere,im not even going to that place. girlfriend. that's a....... who was that ear why was it cut off. why is that woman there. what was the point of this. just see isabella naked? don't know where palmer. bob has a tattoo for you laura
2,"Dennis is the reason I gave it 2, otherwise 1 star","I love hoppers role in this movie, he is evil and twisted enough, but that's about as far as the good goes on this movie. ..... I think the movie began aggravating me around the point when the sang the blue velvet song for the 20th time in the film (the whole thing) bunch of time killing if you ask me, as sign of a bad movie!! The character of hopper is enough to keep you watching this, and waiting to see what will happen next, but that's about is far as it goes, boring movie, stupid movie - because anyone else in this ladies situation would have done something to get out of the situation. Verdict: if you like hearing Blue Velvet 20 million times, get this!"
1,WELL...IT'S GOT ALOT OF PRETTY COLORS.,"and that's about all it has.After reading countless reviews for this i gave it a try..needless to say it did not impress.The cinematography is exceptional...however it is relied upon to heavilly...this movie was like looking at a shiny penny,at first it dazzles then you realize it is just a penny.lynch seems to prefer style over substance as every scene could be a still picture(then be called art),but in trying to evoke a story he relies on the viewers ability to read between the lines and hoping that the pretty colors will be enough to make the B-movie writing thought-provoking.If you feel like zoning out for awhile,looking at some pretty colors and giving your brain a little rest then rent this.other than that there are numerous movies out there that rely on sound writing and stories than visual flair."
4,Still Powerful Film-making,"I had first seen Blue Velvet in the theater when it first came out. I was confused, disturbed and, yet, inexplicably mesmerized by it. There was nothing around like it. Nowadays, film-makers try to challenge us with ""innovative"" cuts, digital manipulation, gratuitous sex and over-the-top characterizations.What makes Blue Velvet still worth viewing (for those who can stomach it) is its very ""conventional"" film technique and character/plot development which still manages to produce a disturbing and inexplicably mesmerizing experience. I'm less confused now but much more appreciative of David Lynch's film-making. It's all pretty tightly done. Once you get through Dennis Hopper's unforgettable portrayal of a Frank Booth -- realistic and demonic -- you'll wonder why he does those bland commercials now."
4,wierd film!,This is one David Lynch film you have to see. It is so wierd that it's great. On blu-ray even better.
3,disturbing???,"I'm just curious as to why people keep referring to this movie as ""disturbing"" and ""dark""..it really wasn't.It wasn't graphic or gory or anything..I watched this movie last nite with the expectations that it was going to be incredibly weird and freaky and thought provoking..well it really wasn't-it pretty much just had a basic murder mystery plot..I'm not saying it was a bad movie,it wasn't really and I liked the way music played a big role in the film,I just honestly don't understand what the big deal surrounding this movie is."
2,Sorry... not very good at all,"Beautifully filmed, but utterly stupid in its meandering and dumb plot. I'd love to smack Kyle MacLachlan's character over the head about fifty times with a rubber mallet. He may well be the single most stupid and naive dolt in all of cinema and I'm not sure that Lynch meant to make him quite that stupid.Movie tries to be cool and creepy and weird (""Hey, small towns have strange people in them, too!"") Whoopee-stinkin'-doo, I say.I had an acquaintance who used to say ""I hate weirdness that exists for weirdness' sake only."" Now I know what he meant. Pass."
5,"dark, disturbing, and extremely delightful!","Blue Velvet for me is one of those rare films that you can watch over and over and never get tired of.This movie has remained in my top five favorites for over 12 years.All the actors are supurbin thier performances.Especially Dennis Hopper and his airmask!One of the most suprising things about the film is how quickly it turns from an innocent bit of story telling to one of the mostcontriversial masterpieces ever! Although I will not give any details about the plot,I recommend this one with a vengence! However, this is not a movie for everyone. Lynch's trademark strangeness shows no mercy and could perhaps shatter the sensesof some more conservative mainstream viewers.I only wish that Lynch had followed this same pattern with Wild At Heart."
4,Right brain vs left brain-> everyone wins!,"Lynch subverts the logical paradigm in high style with a lovely piece of neon noise starring the LOVELY Isaballa Rosellini. It is a beautiful mish mash of colliding worlds where no normal reconcilliation can be found. Crazy people doing CRAZY things behind every door, under every floor, where sanity is a sign of weakness, and love an article of trade. Not so much shocking as stimulating, not so much viscious as visceral... worth watching."
2,Very unsettling and confusing movie!,"Dennis Hopper is a Great actor, Kyle McLachlan is better than average. But why they would agree to be in this weird, confusing movie is beyond me. Why does Kyle sleep with Rosselini when he already has a girlfriend? And when he knows he could be killed at her house if Frank shows up? Yes, this was the weirdest movie I have ever seen, weirder than Existenz or a Clockwork Orange. I didn't think the plot was very developed, I though the motivation for the characters' action went mostly unexplained, and I did not understand why so many people love this movie...But if you do love it, good for you - at least Lynch has made some people happy. I am just voicing my opinion, not putting down anyone who loves this film. Like some have said, this film is not for everyone. I give it 2 stars (instead of 1) because it was original, even though I didn't like it, and Dennis Hopper was convincing as the villain."
2,Art thou entertainment?,"There are enough opinons about this movie to make it mandatory viewing for anyone who likes things a bit off center. It has interesting characters and visuals, but is short on plot and acting. Kyle McLachan and the rest of the cast are not very interesting to watch; Dennis Hopper is, but goes over the top to the point where his character is almost comical. Some satire going on here too, which not everybody ""gets."" Watch it once to see what all the fuss is about, but it's more something to render judgement on than to enjoy."
5,yum,"The pretzels were delicious and a big hit as favors at my daughter's bridal shower. 4 were broken, but they were tasty."
3,Good for light duty,The support is exactly as shown and would work for many but is is light duty. Tools are required for assembly. My therapist recommended that I not use it as it tended to slide and tip if pressure was applied other than vertically. I would recommend it for those who need only slight assistance or steadying to stand.
4,Great help!,"I got this for my husband. It works very well with the rocking chair in our living room! Wouldn't work for all chairs, but fine for some! It was simple to assemble with clear instructions. The magazine rack will holster a laptop if you prefer. Had to reverse the direction of some bolts so the bolt ends would not scratch. Great for the price. My only complaint is that our kitten had a go at the padding on the hand grips; it must have smelled interesting. At our house it's known as the standee-upee."
3,Accessible handrail alternative,"I'm a polio survivor wearing one full-length leg brace, 5'3"" 135lbs. This product works okay for me. I didn't want to have handrails installed on the walls on either side of the toilet and thought this product would work okay for me.It is pretty stable when used, easily moves when I want to vacuum and mop.I would be concerned about usage if I weighed more than 200lbs. I don't know how long the screws would stay in place because of the force that is used when pushing down (and out) as I stand. For now, it's working fine.Reasonable alternative to putting permanent handrails on the walls."
1,Mr. Unnhappy camper,"It is a cheaply made piece of junk ---------- I'm giving it away, for it's too much trouble to send it back."
5,All 5 were put to good use.,They have ben a help and life saver for me because of my doble knee replacement. Helping me get up from low seats.
4,Toilet safety support fits small bathroom,The support works but the person using it is handicapped and has to be very careful to keep it from overbalancing.
2,This didnt work for me,The side bars were not adjustable so they couldnt be raized higher. Too low to help with getting up. Will be returning.
1,junk,"Sent 2 left arms, so had to drill holes for mirror image. Tube covers were not all there. Wobbly after construction. Made in China."
2,Ideaworks JB4349 Deluxe Toilet Safety Support,"Support system is very flimsy. Was very difficult to assemble, requires many tools such as wrenches and philips screwdriver. If you are handicapped or not used to assembling difficult poorly manufactured items. pass on this one. We discarded it as a big mistake."
2,Not steady enough,I bought this toilet safety support for my mother who is 88. It doesn't stay in place and scoots across the bathroom. It also made blocked the toilet paper which I hadn't considered when I bought this item. It is now in the garage--useless.
3,Dictionary-Style,"I was expecting this book to be similar to the ""dirty spanish"" set up. However, I was disappointed. It is set up just like a dictionary. Some phrases are in one part and not in the other; I really dislike the organization at all. Disappointing."
5,"The hottest, comprehensive book on Spanish slang ever!","Of all the books I have read on Spanish slang and idioms, this is by far the best I have ever seen. It's quite comprehensive and well documented by country and region, easily accessible by Spanish to English, English to Spanish entries. One of the great pluses of this edition is that native readers from several Spanish-speaking countries contributed in developing the final manuscript. Thus, regional variations are clearly delineated, which makes this book so highly valuable. You can easily dispense with the authors's previously published book, especially the popular Street Spanish series, and make this your ""bible"" on Spanish slang. First rate! Indispensable!"
4,"Not bad, but more polite in some ways that the Mahler book.","[See also the review for Dictionary Of Spanish Slang and Colloquial Expression by Michael Mahler]This volume uses different expressions than the above-mentioned, which is also recommended, but where some words are shared, e.g, desconojarse, to laugh one's a** off, this volume can be more polite, due to (possibly) women translating these expressions, as opposed to men [not to be sexist]. Still, as mentioned in the Mahler review, Calo, or Gutter Spanish [out of print] is the most direct [and it's a much thinner book]. Like with the Mahler book, it could do with a pronunciation guide, otherwise, a fine book. [This is the ""real"" Spanish most of us weren't taught in school, much like with German and any other foreign language.]"
3,Reprise of 1950s to 1960 TV,"These discs contain skits, out takes, and full shows. The full shows include commercials and singing/dancing numbers- remember Red Skelton had a variety show. Fabian sings in his appearance. The best part was the ad libs or when he forgot his lines. He had some great “straight people” to play off of and several times they steal the scene. You’ll really be taken back in time when Tide was a new detergent for “wringer washing machines”. Red works the sponsor and products into his comments. Sure different from today.While some skits are funny, fans of Red Skelton will be disappointed that his gut splitting skits do not fill the discs. Some of the skits are repeated on the 2nd disc. My preference would be for his show in the late 1960s through the 1970s."
3,ehhh it's OK at best,"This ""collection"" is mediocre at best. There are about 2 REALLY good songs per CD. The rest are eith just ok or down right stink. There's a reason why some of these bands are no longer bands. I'd give this collection a 2.5 at best. Save your money and just download the individual songs that you know you like. I was hoping to discover some new stuff, but I didn't."
1,A Waste of Time,"If you're looking for a read with some excitement, an interesting story line, and hilarious characters, you've come to the wrong place. Rose's husband leaves her after twenty or so years of marraige and she gets on with her life; end of story. No meat, no cheese sauce, no chocolate syrup. Just boring, dull, and uneventful."
2,What a depressing book.,"I kept waiting for the ""revenge"" part but it never came. The main character was a wimp who let her husband and his mistress walk all over her. I never felt that the characters were real, they seemed very one dimensional."
3,Too British!,The Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman by Elizabeth Buchan was mediocre. Sooo British. Feelings understated - the weather and other mundane things detailed like a Rembrandt.
3,What Revenge?,"I'm a middle-aged woman and I was very disappointed in it. I wanted something that showed how age and experience can outwit youth and miniskirts, but it's not here. It's not that Buchan doesn't have writing talent; it's just that her characters were pretty unbelievable to me -- they have no standards, no guts, no pride. Read Beth Gutcheon, Anita Shreve or Anita Brookner instead."
3,Not my type of book . . .,The book is written in UK English and it took me a while to get into the book.
3,the title says it all,"This book, while written beautifully, is too predictable. Rose is married to Nathan who leaves her for a younger woman. Everything just continues to go downhill for Rose at that point and only till the end, does the reader have some room to breathe.I was disappointed in this book because it looked like it would have such potential but the flame was shortlived."
2,Predictable,"I have to admit that I am not generally a fan of ""chick lit"" but this came with high recommendations. I predicted the affair and the participants and was impatient for the ""shoe to drop"". By that time, I had not even developed a fondness for the heroine, which made the rest of the book less than desirable. I prefer Anita Shreve or Elizabeth Berg for similar story lines with more complex plots and engaging personalities."
1,Best thing about the book is the title,The best thing about this book is the title.Middle-aged woman is abandoned by her husband for m-a-w's (very youthful) assistant. I missed the revenge of the title.Don't waste your time.
2,an easy read but very predictable and cliched,"Other reviewers have recounted the plot in more detail - a middle-class married woman with 2 kids, a career and a husband who leaves her for a younger woman until younger woman turns ugly and middle class woman finds an old love to turn to - so I won't do that here. It is easy reading, not requiring any real thought and very predictable. The reader knows how the book will end a few pages in. I actually became annoyed with the main character at times becasue I thought she was too much of a patsy. She never really stood up for herself and her children to her husband and for what she probably deserved out of the divorce. She easily gave up her house and garden, something she truly loved. This is something for the beach but not something to read if you want to actually think."
3,not great/not bad,"This was an entertaining read. Nothing so gripping or so wildly entertaining that I couldn't put it down, but it was a good 'no-brainer'. Once again I find myself grateful for the 'bargain books' section where I found it. How I long for one of those books that I just can't put down, that I stay up until the wee hours absorbed in......seems like forever since I've had my hands on one."
4,Great PMS read!,"Oh, great book if you've ever lost a love to another woman! My British mother in-law sent this to me (telling me something?!) and I just loved it. I'd never read this author before and was surprised it wasn't a over-winded ""Rosemund Piltcher"" type book. It also fuels that fantasy of ""The One That Got Away""! What happens to the hubby in the end is just grand. Read it with a smile on your face. It's not just for ""middle-aged"" women either. Anyone can appreciate what Rose goes though."
3,what revenge?,"Maybe it's because I'm not a middle aged woman, but my perspective on this was a bit different. Was her revenge that she didn't take him back, even with everyone in her life telling her to? I had a bit of trouble with it. I read it for my bookgroup - not sure it would be something I'd choose on my own."
2,Where is the revenge?,"Title does not fit the book. All she does is roll over and let the world walk all over her. I was dissapointed there was no revenge, even at the one point in the book it would have been easily available to her."
2,Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman,Boreing Boreing i just did not enjoy it it was just about ok i cant find anymore words for it
4,Wonderfully satisfying,"Buchan writes with amazing honesty infused with humor and pain and insight, and draws her characters in 3-D. Her words are strung together like a beautiful garland, and I am anxious to read her other works. The heroine was immensely sympathetic, but not without her own admitted flaws. I very much relished this book."
2,Warning! It's not too late to cancel your order!!!,"After reading the ""blurb"" on the back of the book, I was looking forward to tucking-in to a pleasant, light read. Early on, it was obvious that this story was FAR from what I expected. According to what was promised in the synopsis, ""funny...witty"", ""...cheer for Rose Llyod..."", ""...this triumphant novel will strike a chord..."", it sadly turned out to be NONE of the above. I never found any reason to cheer, as it was not that type of story, and I slogged through poor Rose's sad state of affairs. I also grew weary of the many flashbacks and ended up skipping some of these sections all together. If you are expecting what I expected out of this DEPRESSING book, you too, will be disappointed."
2,A real bore,This book just did not get interesting until the last couple of chapters. It is predictable and just plain boring. Don't waste your time.
2,Wrong Title,"Instead of ""Revenge of . . ."", this book would better be titled ""Resignation of . . ."". I kept waiting for the main character (Rose) to take hold and deal realistically (not ballistically) with her circumstances. However, the author was determined to mold her character into a pseudo-mature, compliant, long-suffering blob. I suppose we are to appreciate how marvelously evolved and noble Rose is. Sorry, it doesn't work! Capitulation should not be confused with strength. This book is fiction indeed -- an improbable manipulation of characters and plot."
5,STOLEN LIFE,"Iloved this book and am so happy I have discovered Elizabeth Buchan for myself.The heroine,Rose, was betrayed twice - once by her husband and once by her best friend. Which is the greater loss? The author leaves it up to the reader.This first book, of a series of two, paints Rose as the undeserving victim of theft. Her husband was stolen by her best friend. Is Rose the only victim? Is she not at all to blame for the circumstances that result in this broken marriage? Read this and discover where your sympathies lie.A really good read! There's a message for everyone in this tale."
3,A Slow Revenge,"It was not too bad, wasn't what I expected. Was expecting good old fashion she-devil kind of book. What you get is just a normal story... of a divorced lady, dealing with divorce, like all divorced people do. No pizazz, no drama, no revenge in sight.It read slow, it was back and forth, present and past...and when she was writing in the present, it was a fast wonderful read (a little like Daniel Steel), but it would drop when she flashed back, and she flashed back often. Most the flashbacks were drawn out and boring.I have to agree with some of the reviews, I never saw much of a change in her, I was hoping for a metamorphosis, a moth to a butterfly. What I got was maybe... a grub to a June bug."
2,wallbanger,"Wallbanger! Didn't like the way Rose acted towards her husband, Nathan when he dropped his bomb. Heck didn't like the way she acted towards Minty or the fact that Nathan thought his bomb wouldn't affect his grown children and that Poppy should deal with it too. Nathan wasn't very likeable at all! Seemed that he was just searching for excuses from the word go and then when he got what he wanted with Minty, along with the marital home which felt like he railroaded Rose into giving him, he didn't seem to be to happy. He seemed to believe that Rose settled but I think he did later on. Didn't like Hal either. He was selfish and self absorbed. Sure he apologized but I think it was too late."
2,What Revenge?,"I was ready for something fun and inspiring. This book (which I listened to on CD) seemed dull and depressing to me. Where was the revenge?It was also very difficult to follow in the audio format. It kept jumping around in time without any warning. On paper this might not have been a problem, but it was very confusing to listen to. I can think of several ways this could have been rectified, but no signals were given. I wouldn't recommend it, particularly not in audio form."
2,You Call That Revenge?,"I am really tired of woman gets dumped, Woman seeks revenge kind of books. They are a dime a dozen! And what's more dissappointing is in this book, I kept waiting for her to take revenge and she never really does. It was a totally depressing book. This was a book club read and I had such a difficult time getting through the entire book. If I did not have to read it, I would have quit reading about 1/4 of the way through."
3,Read it only if you love to be sad,"This book is nicely written with characters you fall in love with - but then the author rips apart their lives. The book ends with pretty much everyone sad, their lives mundane and definitely no revenge. There are no happy people in this book - just people getting by, barely. And yes this may be a look into what real life is like but most of us have already realized that as the Buddhists say ""all life is sorrowful"".Don't read this book if you are looking for light entertainment."
3,A bit stiff but good for the price,I wanted something cheap for emergencies. This tool is solid if not a bit heavy and the tools are hard to twist out but that's a good thing. Would buy again.
3,"Solid, but bulky","This is a well built tool, and it contains most things you'll need. It is on the bulky side though. There have been a couple occasions where it didn't fit the job; pedal work mainely. For the price its ok, but in hindsight I would have spent a bit more to get something better"
3,Fun until...,"...you lose the 6x8 adapter. Don't kid yourself, you will, and nobody sells a replacement. (Calling Topeak, maybe they'll mail me a freebie.) Also, only has hex wrenches, one torx and one phillips; I don't like going out without box wrenches. On the plus side, its so small, its like carrying nothing at all, and you usually don't need more."
2,Mini 9,Topeak The Mini 9-Function Bicycle Tool don't know why i have this in my review don't have this tool someone must have updated the wrong account looks to small to use
5,Excelente,"Me encanto el producto, es como lo describen, y es de excelente calidad y lo recomiendo a las personas que lo quieran comprar."
5,Great Multi Tool,I carry this tool in backpack when I ride. It has come in handy several times and has all of the basic needs. I have also used it while working on my bike in the garage to avoid pulling out all of my tools. The quality is great!
5,"Awesome, Gory, and Indie for sure!",Great gory cheesy horror flick! I'm a huge fan of over the top horror films and this one fits the mold quite nicely. Low budget? Sure. But what else would you expect from an indie horror film. A must for the movie library if you like/love horror films!
5,Gory fun!,"Okay, this movie is a bit amateurish, but the plot is plausible and lots of gore when you least expect it. Not appropriate for kids."
3,"Lots of Attachments, in fact too many!","Really just wanted a beard trimmer, it does an alright job at that. My Norelco beard trimmer was much better. Both trimmer heads of the Conair are just too small and the height adjustments are rather clumsy and have a very narrow range.As far as the other attachments- probably won't use them."
3,It works but,It works just like all the rest. My only complaint is that u can't use it while it is plugged in. So annoying.
2,poor quality,This rope only lasted one month outside before it was rotten and brokemaybe good for inside jobs watch yourself
3,"No really, it's not solid braid.","The rope is nice diamond braid rope, but it is not solid braid. There is definitely a core in this rope. This rope should be relabeled. Be careful when buying this rope because it is not as strong as true solid braid. For my application it is fine but for others it could be dangerous.Also it did not come on the spool that is in the picture. The spool is thinner in diameter but taller."
5,Final review: a mamooth entreprise...that paid off,"In a late Eighteenth Century setting, between fashionable London and backward Virginia, two twin brothers from the nobility spend their formative period trying to flee a domineering dowager mother in different ways - the older a saturnine, melancholy character, the younger an easy going type. Both, in their own way, succeed; but both reach old age feeling themselves equally swindled. The usual Thackeray touch of good humoured aristocratic melancholy aimed at bourgeois philisteism. A lot of good episodes also. Only, for XXIst. Century standards, enormouly long-winded and difficult to read from cover to cover. However, perservere, and you will find yourself rewarded as you finish."
4,Feels Good,Great CD! I've been a fan of Take 6 since their debut and this CD is as good as the rest.
5,Wow!,"Take 6 is America's preeminent acapella gospel group, and they knocked this one out of the park! Powerful, beautiful, strong, sweet, smooth, precise, engaged, warm, loving. Brought tears to my eyes! You know you want this, so go get it, you will be glad you did!"
2,Better than no spare!,Batteries hold up well but takes both hands and a little manuvering to get out of the charger once locked in place. Thought I was going to break one of the tangs getting it out! Battery won't charge until it's fully locked into the charger!
4,DOLPH DOES IT AGAIN!!!,Russel Mulcahy has made a absolutely great action-flick with Dolph Lundgren. Maximum with a twist! Plot is good (not smart but good)Lundgren is just great an Bellman is also good.
1,"It's Dolph Lundgren, people...","This movie fails on all counts. The action is bland and weak, the script sounds like a third grader's nightmare, and the acting... oh the horror! Dolph Lundgren carries big guns and walks around with a hot babe in what seems like an eternity of soul-murdering hell..."
2,Substandard Fare From the King of Action!,"This particular Lundgren movie was slow moving and dull. Through the whole movie you're waiting for Lungren's rock em', sock em' action. There's just not enough of it in this flick. Dolph is too quiet and to boring. They just threw the broad in. She really doesn't fit in at all. The only good thing about this movie is Dolph Lundgren's Swedish good looks; and for that reason only ,I give it two stars."
2,the DVD is short,The DVD is not up to the same standards as the VHS tape. It is shorter and is only pan and scan. Usually movies for rental are P&S. Collectors of movies want widescreen and full length (at least what was seen on the big screen).I liked this movie but I am [not happy] that they would release a less that optimal version on DVD. The VHS version is only P&S but atleast the whole movie is there.
3,stylish action,"The beginning scene is strange, with Dolph exiting his street-level apartment with his ""violin"", as if he is about to go amble over to work , in some forgotten, quiet, mill town. The setting is strange..., a huge, modern skyscraper, again, in the middle of an unnaturally quiet city.Summed up, the movie does not really make sense-yet I still enjoyed the action and sarcastic remarks. Dolph's war weary mercenary character seemed improbable ( why keep working for the ""corporation"", if you continually refuse to do the dirty work--do they have some unmentioned black mail on him? An explanation would have been nice ).It is a dark movie and makes no apologies for that, right up to the ambiguous ending.On an unfortunate note, if you are a fan of the movie ( I am ), then you will be disappointed by the lack of wide screen, and by the missing scenes. We could hope for a director's cut release, but the general lack of popularity of this movie might preclude that."
2,Keillor is a pessimist,"G. Keillor has once again proven, in the style of his 'Book of Guys', that American pessimism is alive and well. I liked some of the songs, but too many were inherently sad. I hate sentimental portrayals of cats, but more texts inspired by admiration for cats would have been welcome."
5,More great music about my Favorite Pets,"After listening to the musical ""Cats"" numerous times, a friend recommended this to me as more entertainment for Cat Lovers. It is very cute and entertaining. Arrived quickly. and at a reasonable price."
1,Not for me,I did not really like the cd. It is not my type of material. I find it more for those that like musicals or broadway.
4,Awesome dictionary,"This is awesome for those who are rusty in Viet. It is not good for someone who needs to understand grammar, but is excellent for those who need to build vocabulary. I am using it to brush up on my Viet. It looks like this is a series so they should have it in other languages. It is definitely worth the twelve dollars and change. I bought this along with The Rough Guide to Vietnamese Dictionary Phrasebook 3 (Rough Guide Phrasebooks). Get it now!"
4,The Child's World First Reader,"I received my book today. It is in great shape for a book so old! I actually ordered it for the Dark Pony story. I read this as a child and I told the story to my children (although they do not remember it). I was trying to get my 2 year old granddaughter to go to sleep 2 weekends ago and was trying to think of stories to tell her. I remembered this great story and she absolutely loved it! Of course, I then had to search to find the book and I am so glad I did! This will be treasured for many years to come!"
2,another mediocre album,"I have yet to see why people rave about this band. Sure, the drummer is really good, but that doesnt make Cryptopsy as a whole a good band.You want something different, go listen to Obscura by Gorguts. It'll blow your mind and it sure blows away anything that crapsloppy has done."
4,Lord Worm aint so great...,"I love the music, I love Cryptopsy but Lord Worm aint so great. The only thing that bugs me about this album is his voice. I really would have wished for some throat like in None So Vile but you cant always get what you want..."
4,WHY????,"Why in the name of all that's holy did Cryptopsy bring back Lord Worm? Oh man, I thought he sounded ridiculous on None So Vile... but he just sounds horrible on this. Such a shame, because the instrumental work is some of the best cryptopsy has done. Flo is amazing as usual, the guitars are blazing, great bass work... but then Lord Worm comes in... Well, what I can say is that Lord Worm does write some fairly awesome lyrics, so I'll be a bit more generous with the amount of stars I'll give this. Bottom line: Ignore the vocals, and you have one killer album."
4,great comeback,"I'm a lord worm fan to the grave. I was so happy to hear that he was coming back and he didn't dissapoint me. Granted, he doesn't do very much low growling but his mids and highs are still in tact. You've got to keep in mind these guys are almost 40 years old! Flo breaks down walls with his drumming here. My friend (a drummer) and I have been trying to figure out hot he does the fast snare work in Carrionshine all while hitting symbols. It's mind boggling!"
3,I'll have to check out their older stuff.,"Yup. By all accounts Lord Worm's vocals are much stronger on older releases such as None so Vile, and I feel the need to check that out. This album shows great promise, particularly in the drumming department, but the vocals are so weak that I find myself actively trying to ignore them throughout the album. There is also some definite guitar-slop to be found, less than equal to the ""technical metal"" tag this band has recieved. Otherwise, this would be a 4-star release."
5,"Tha Real OG ""Original Gangsta"" - Check out Devin the Dude's latest","if you love OG Ron C, check out his homie Devin the Dude Smoke Sessions, Vol. 1- track 3 getting high is something to smoke to - whoah - this is the first album of Devin's to hit the Billboard Charts - Congrats - OG Ron C states this is one of the best albums of 2008"
3,Bad quality...too edited..too short,the best footage of the set comes from the copenhagen gig...that one looks the best almost like they are recording in a private studio. its the footage where there is an american flag as the rug.i don't like how they cut in between this gig and a couple others and the others look horrible...they should of just shown 1 gig at a time....all this inter-cutting in between gigs ruins the immersiveness imo.if you want the complete copenhagen show. get the soundstage dvd.
3,Misleading,"Most of the contents are from the Roundhouse DVD...which was released in its entirety as The Doors are Open. Here is the correct tracklisting:THe Doors Live in Europe DVDTrack Listing:1. Light My Fire (London, sEPT 6, 1968)2. Love Me Two Times (cOPENHAGEN, sEPT 18, 1968)3. Back Door Man (London, sEPT 6, 1968)4. Spanish Caravan (London, sEPT 6, 1968)5. Hello, I Love You (AMSTERDAMN, SEPT 15, 1968)6. When the Music's Over (cOPENHAGEN, sEPT 18, 1968)7. Unknown Soldier (cOPENHAGEN, sEPT 18, 1968)8. Light My Fire (II) (London, sEPT 6, 1968)9. Five To One (fRANKFURT, sEPT 14, 1968)10. Alabama Song (STUDIO TRACK)"
2,Must be a Doors fan,You probably need to be a big Doors fan to enjoy this DVD. The sound is mono and pretty poor. Don't buy it for the music.
1,Don't bother,You have to be a real fan to find anything positive with this DVD. It reminded me of my home movies from grade school.. It was in black and white for the most part and the sound quality was terrible !!!!
5,Newsflash: Doors Rule!,"This is one of my favorite DVD's. I have always liked the Doors, but being only 22 years old obviously never had the oppurtunity to see them live. Well, now I can. The audio and video are in great condition considering it's three decades old. Morrison truly becomes part of the song and he definitely sets the mood. The organ will shake the walls with home theatre. Grace Slick provides a mini-interview, it shows the band and fans showing their respects to Morrison at what I assume is his burial site (it had a bust where people threw flowers), and there is even a music video.SONGS INCLUDE: Light My Fire/ Love Me Two Times/ Back Door Man/ Spanish Caravan/ Hello, I Love You/ When the Music's Over/ Unknown Soldier/ Five to One/ Alabama Song"
4,"Around Auburn, NY","Good historical photos of my home town the way it used to be. Before ""urban renewal"" turned Auburn into a ghost town."
5,Excellent shoes,"Found my first pair in a Clarks retail store. However, as usual, when I went back to get another pair, they were out. Found it on Amazon and ordered them. Good waterproof shoes that are very comfortable, and look good too."
4,A very good read.,"I found the book full of well referenced observations, put together in a thought provoking and inspiring style. I was a little puzzled by the liberally used terms: 'God' and 'religion' which did not come with any reference. Which God the author was presenting is not made clear. Most of us live in a world surrounded by different cultures, many claim to follow the true God. For the most part the book relies on clear empirical data, but I found the introduction of unsupported terms like 'Divine transcendence' and 'the hand of god must be there' totally out of keeping with the rest of the book.For the most part the book laid out clear lines of thought, but I found that religion was left without the same examination, although it seemed to be presented as 'the' possible answer, without any material to support this assertion. It may well be, however, the book introduces this main concept, and moves over it, rather than through it."
5,Social Psych,"I am finding The Social Animal to be quite interesting. It seems to cover the relevent information thoroughly, and yet fails to be boring in doing so. Aronson is,of course, the father of social psychology, and that alone would make this a must read for anyone interested in the subject, but Aronson also makes the subject fun as well as educational."
5,The Social Animal: Bible of the Psychology of Society,"This a fantastically user friendly guide to understand whether or not things we say about much of human behavior is true. For example ""Is beauty really in the eye of the beholder?"" ""If I want people to believe me, should I speak first or last?"" ""What attracts people to each other?"" ""Will seeing violence on TV matter?"" Elliot Aronson, author of 15 books, noted scientist, and member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, concisely explains a number of social issues with the light of scientific truth. Internationally recognized for sixteen years, The Social Animal, offers plain and often funny insight as to what psychologists know about human behavior in the social context. Used as both text book and sophisticated reading, few books offer enlightenment about what happens in social cirmstances, with such easily understood and scientific presentation."
5,IT STARTED IT ALL,"Even if we have been treated to the more realistic dinosaurs courtesy of JURASSIC PARK et al, Ray Harryhausen's groundbreaking 1953 movie is still delightful to watch. Released in the era when nuclear bombs were more prominently in our thoughts, the movie scolds science and yet embraces our long past as well. Savor the joys of this classic: the stop animation dinosaur seems real because it's well done; there is no foul language; no nudity; the hero and heroine act like high school teens of the fifties; the violence is cartoonish and never overplayed. The monster's attack on the lighthouse is still a classic moment from our science fiction monster films. The DVD includes an interview with Harryhausen and esteemed sci-fi writer Ray Bradbury. Harryhausen died not long after this interview was filmed, leaving a legacy that fans of this genre will long extol."
3,One of the classics,Have seen this movie before. Plenty of action special effects are not to bad but nothing to brag about. Good late night movie when not much to do. Good acting for that time period.
5,Harryhausen awesomeness,"One of the greatest scifi films of the 50's the Beast from 20,000 Fathoms is a ray Harryhausen classic. It follows many of the large radioactive monsters of the time, however the monster in this is what makes it so impressive. From the destruction of the lighthouse to its demise trapped in the fencing of a rollercoaster. There's also a small role by Lee Van Cleef."
5,Superb Monster Movie From The Atomic Age,"Consonant with Everything Atomic in the 1950s, this great monster film bought into the vision completely. When a prehistoric reptile suddenly emerges to wreak havoc on civilization, conventional weapons (tanks and so forth) are ineffective, so they must kick it up a notch.Having seen this film as a kid, I watched it again in college with a friend who majored in nuclear engineering. At the point in the movie where everyone realizes that ordinary munitions won't kill the beast, and they turned to a scientist who said, ""There's only one thing that will work in a situation like this: RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES,"" my nuclear friend nearly choked laughing at this Hollywood-concocted absurdity.It's doubtful, with contemporary special effects, that today's kids would find this movie appealing. But for all the boomers who grew up with this sort of thing, it's an eminently enjoyable classic."
4,"One of these days, they'll listen to those scientists. . .","A hungry Verasaurus goes in search of his spawning grounds and stops off for a roller coaster ride at Coney Island. This is a surprisingly engaging film that doesn't go overboard, mixing adequate special effects with a decent story line and an unusual amount of character development for early Science Fiction. There are no standouts in the cast, but the acting is superior to most films of this era and genre. Watch for a very young Lee Van Cleef as an Army sniper at the end of the movie."
3,Adult Popcorn,"This movie is what I call ""Adult Popcorn."" That doesn't mean you have to be one, but it helps.When you are asked what movie you want to rent or buy, try this one.Corny yes. Not great special affects. This is Jurasic Park 50 years before that movie was released. Old yes and fun to. Don't forget the popcorn."
5,Godzilla's Anceaster,"This movie is not a very famous movie. The thing is it should be. The story's about a group of scientists that head to the artic to explore the poler icecaps. Suddenly there was an explosian. Two scientists were around the area. Out rose a monster larger than Taro, the sinbad dragon. A moster stong enough to be a powerful Godzilla foe. The beast caused an avelanch, killing one of the sientists and injuring the other. After that he new what he just saw was too terrifying to be real. But there was a humongus problem in his mind, it was. This movie should have been given more credit than it was for without this movie and without Rhedosaurus, we would have no Godzilla."
4,Absolute classic of the genre,"YOu've seen the basic plot 100,000 times: Big creature, often dino-like, wreaks havoc on major city. BUt this is the one that started the ball rolling. Harryhausen's solo effort is still entertaining, despite the mediocre acting associated with all films like this (it actually adds to the whole experience). This is one you'll want to watch again. Don't let anyone give away anything. Just get it and watch it! Great fun!"
4,one of harryhausen's best,it took awhile but beast is finally on dvd...video quality is very good but once again sound is only 1 channel mono...warner bros again has done a injustice by doing this in one channel only. the previews and extras are at least in surround..why can't the whole movie be done in surround...not sure.. house of wax was put out in surround but most are not..one channel mono is the worst sound you can put out on dvd...but sound notwithstanding the movie is one of ray's best work..especially the rampage in downtown new york...excellent work especially when the monster goes thru buildings..that is the work of a genius.
2,Beats from 20000 Fathoms,"I love old sci-fi movies and this wasn't one of the better ones.It was okay, but I was a little disappointed in it."
1,Parents use caution - not for children,"I am very disappointed and shocked by this video. I took it out from our public library with high hopes for my children who enjoy Dr. Seuss books. Mixed into this video of bits about different Dr. Seuss stories are images of swastikas, Nazi's and even Hitler. Apparently the author of Dr. Seuss books did a documentary during W.W. II and footage of it is included in this video. I strongly feel that this is inappriate for children to watch. There are scenes from Kristallnacht - when the Nazi's looted and burned Jewish stores. Why was this included and why isn't there a warning on the box? I do not want my children seeing images that will stay in their mind of these terrible things. I am shocked by how many positive reviews of this video are listed. After informing my local librarian of the contents of this video, she removed it from the children's section."
1,Truly Awful!,"This has to qualify as one of the worst films of all time. It has the unfunniest jokes, the most bored-looking stars, and the stupidest makeup of any film! It is an insult to Dr.Seuss, Ted Geisel, AND Theo. LeSeig(His various names). It has a good story to tell but botches it totally. A pain to watch."
5,Childhood Nostalgia,"The first time I saw this movie, I was 5 years old and loved it. Cut to 17 years later, I had to buy it (for myself) and I love it just the same! It's educational as well as entertaining, and I think it's a great film for all ages. The price was reasonable and the shipping was quick. I chose standard shipping and received it within what was listed as the minimum delivery time. All in all, it was a great movie and a great ordering experience."
2,One size shouldn't be plus size,"This is product is advertised as ""one size"" but mine came as a plus size/Q size. Which I am not. So I can't use it. Not really worth returning since it cost under 5 dollars, but still annoying! The actual stocking look good though!"
1,ViZ releases $25 DVDs with only 3 episodes are rip-offs!,"I have nothing against the TV show. In my opinion, its great and its an anime classic. However, I hate the fact that these DVDs which contain ONLY 3 episodes are sold for $20 and (if you go to some foreign Jap/China town in the US) they sell for $30!! I mean, three episodes? Rip off! In my opinion, one episode is worth $1. Plus, the extras in these DVDs aren't even all that great either!Back in the early 2000's, company's like Pioneer/Geneon Entertainment sell one Sailor Moon DVD for $14.99 and they contain 6-7 episodes! Boo to ViZ. At least put 6 episodes in a DVD if you're going to sell your products at ridiculously high prices...but I guess its too late for that. I wonder if they're going to release the Final Act series... Also...why doesn't ViZ sub the opening and ending songs?! LAZYYYY!!"
1,mediamom,"I am always on the look out for good sing along dvds for my toddler. We have 5 other disney sing along vhs and dvds. This one is so poorly done, my kids could do better using their computers. Animation from all the winnie the pooh cartoons were used but the characters had different dialog that didn't match the animation. The voices of the characters weren't even close to accurate. My toddler loves winnie the pooh and I expect that is why she will watch this. Anyone older than 2, will have no patience for it."
1,very disappointed,"I have to say I love every Disney movie we have ever gotten, until I purchased Disney sing along with pooh bear and piglet too. I have a 3 year old and she loves the sing along movies. After watching this movie my daugter will not get in the bathtub without shaking and will not allow us to put anything in the bathtub with her. We discovered that her fear came from the movie where there is a part where rabbit and tigger are taking a bath and tigger pulls the plug and rabbit goes down the drain. My gaughters bathtime used to be her most relaxing time of the day. She would take all of her toys in with her, but not anymore. It has become the most stressfull time of the day for her. It is very sad to see her so scared and I just wanted to share this with all who could benefit."
1,Not as good as the other Disney Sing Along,"If your child is a fan of the current Winnie the Pooh show ""My friends Tigger and Pooh"" then they will probably not like this one. Also if your child likes the more upbeat sing alongs this one won't compare."
4,Strictly Winnie...,"It's a cute video, but unlike many other Sing Along Songs versions, only scenes from Winnie the Pooh are included. I find this can start to bore my kids, since the others are usually a smorgasbord of songs from all sorts of the Disney classics.One of the best Sing Alongs by far is the Under the Sea version. Great clips are included from movies as far back as Peter Pan and up to about the Little Mermaid time. That's a great video."
2,Pooh's Sing Along Songs,"Note for Disney Sing Along Songs fans- This DVD only features songs from the Winnie the Pooh films, videos and television series. It doesn't feature songs from any other Disney classics. But anyway...I love Winnie The Pooh. I even bought a shorter version of this on video- it was simply called Sing A Song With Pooh Bear. Now they've added And Piglet Too to the title, as well as songs from Piglet's Big Movie. Piglet's Big Movie was my least favorite of all the Pooh movies so I didn't expect much from this Sing Along Songs DVD- I wasn't disappointed. If only they had songs from Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search For Christopher Robin. Still, this is fun for really young kids and as an added bonus it teaches you how to draw Winnie The Pooh."
2,"Meh, typical Hollywood nonsense","A sad bundle of cliches laced with juvenile Hollywood politics. If you like real espionage, watch (or better, read) The Spy Who Came In From The Cold."
4,The library version,"Received my book pretty quickly, and it was well packaged -- but was surprised that it was actually a previous library item! Don't believe this was mentioned in the description of the book, only that it was like new. Good condition and this was fine, just not expected and I would have preferred a more current printing of the book."
1,Fooled by the contents,"I didn't realize at the time, that I was purchasing a C.D. that only had 3 songs on it. I realize that I am new at these on-line music purchases. My son told me that it probably was stated some where, but I didn't see it anywhere. So I will be much more careful next time to read everything about the C.D. that I'm buying. I love the music of this women but feel ripped-off and wanting a full, at least 10 song C.D."
4,PHAT -,This is a tough track - the clubs here in Vegas blow up when it comes on - a must for the weekend freak list - Buy it
2,What happpened?,"I know rappers gotta grow up and change their styles, but Ice Cube used to be the smartest most powerful rap voice in the industry. Now he's clubbin. He's used to be the rapper we loved to hate. Now we'd just love it if he'd leave quietly without releasign another booty-bouncing radio friendly rap."
2,WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OLD STYLE?,"The song is a-ight, but Cube done changed his ways. Coulda been better - way better."
4,Gift for Dad,"I got this for my Dad, who loves Sudoku and baseball, combining the two is a great idea, he loved it!"
2,Oxo 16' tape did not hold up.,This tape worked well until the return spirng failed. The return spring is totally out of commission. It has broken in several places. Looks like a material defect. DF
1,Good book for 1996...but not 2000,"In brief, this book has not been updated since 1996. Much of its information (and the contents of the companion CD-ROM) is sorely outdated.The introductory chapters, which give an encapsulated history of the Internet and the Web (and all the terminology that goes with it), are interesting. But after that, it's basically an abridged Webstar 1.2 manual. The latter chapters on CGI scripting are still helpful.Those interested in specifically learning about running and managing your own site server are better off going online or just reading the current Webstar manual."
3,The primordal ooze starts here,"Good first efforts from Shudder to Think. This sets the tone for Get Your Goat, when Shudder really caught fire. Compare and contrast this version of Red House from the one on 1,000,000 BC."
1,this band is produced by anyone with a conscience?,"Oh my god, this cd is really awful. I had no idea how terrible this wuld be, I trusted in my love of former Minor Threat frontman Ian and was horribly wronged. I feel jipped, these songs are jangled, unmelodic and ridiculously crappy. I feel like I've been raped by an elephant. BUY THIS......IF YOU LIKE CRAP"
2,Discard,"Face it kiddies and hipster oldies, Ian cannot sing or even bark right. Remember that Minor Threat and Fugazi shirts have nothing to do w/ Dischord--just so we're on a PC level here folks. Why form a band from your favorite bands rather than doing something imaginative and creative? Oh, I forgot Ian is the master of aping something and calling it his own i.e. Minor Threat--a poor Bad Brains ripoff band who had racist/idiotic lyrics--don't try covering it up, it's the truth! Sorry I cannot forgive even if Mr. Mac-eye was a youngster when this all went down. Fugazi=Gang of Four, Mission of Burma, Wire, The Clash in such an obvious and poorly executed manner that it's sickening. Props to Discord however for being so fiercely independent yet at the same time so intolerable to any other beliefs/ideas outside of D.C. or even inside D.C. for that matter. Straight edge foreverxxx."
1,Spin magazine needs 2 die,"I found out about this band from the new issue of Spin where they talk about the best punk cds ever. I dont think ill be checking out n e of the other bands on the list because so far theyve all been really bad. This might just be the wrost of them all. Fugazi cant sing they cant play and this cd sounds like it was recorded in a closet. If this is punk, then punk must be dead."
1,Fu-Get-Over-Yourselfs,"Lemme tell you something about the Fugazi's. This is supposed to be their best record, so back in about 1991 I went to see 'em at my local college music venue which shall remain nameless, and has since been turned into an Arby's. Why do these guys have to be so serious? I know, I know you're from washington d.c, where Bill Clinton was born, but that don't mean you's so much smarter than the audience in said club/Arby's. On stage they was prattling on about how they didn't like how the crowd was so unruly. We's unruly because we don't have good jobs or much money from touring the country like you Fugazi's do. So as punishment to their fans, they stopped playin' after about 4 songs. It really didn't improve my attitude about their band or their music or washington dc."
5,Ten years later and it still blows me away,There are very few albums that send shivers up and down my spine after a decade. This is one of them. Punk rock classic?Yes it is.
3,Hasn't aged well,"I loved Fugazi in high school and this was one of the first albums I ever purchased, but I've noticed it hasn't aged well. I'm personally am not a fan of Ian Mackaye's leftist politics either, or atleast not now. While I will give Mr. Mackaye credit he has managed to keep Dischord independent for over 3 decades. Hits for me are Suggestion, Bad Mouth, Promises, and Margin Walker, the rest I could give or take."
3,We're not a minor threat.....,Love Minor Threat. Love Waiting Room. Hate Fugazi.I am at a total dischord for this album. 3 stars for a song(?) and a small step in the way-back machine.God you kids are so lucky these days to sample music BEFORE you waste your hard-earned greenbacks.
2,Bleh...,"If this music was ice cream, it would be plain vanilla, left in the freezer for too long.I just don't get it. I absolutely love Minor Threat, the Minutemen, Sonic Youth, Husker Du, and many other bands Fugazi is usually grouped with on alt/indie lists, but I find this album nearly unlistenable, even after many listens. It's so bland and boring. It's like Husker Du on sedatives, writing bad songs.The only songs that keep me from falling asleep are ""Waiting Room"" and ""Margin Walker."" The former has nice, loud bursts of guitars and the latter has a cool, uptempo, catchy chorus. All the other songs bore me to tears. They're boring, uninspired, and not in the least bit catchy.I do, however, admore Fugazi's musical ethics. They're very non-conformist, and very punk in attitude. They have their own rules, their own music. It's just not for me.Give this album the skip unless you really enjoy boring, uncatchy alternative/indie rock."
1,Disappointment at it's best,"I enjoy downloading new music in order to find new bands to listen, and Fugazi was one of them. I downloaded ""Waiting Room,"" and was completely blown away by it. So in my typical fashion I immediately went out to buy 13 Songs thinking that it would hold more brilliant songs. But lo and behold I was wrong. Fugazi had fallen victim to the dreaded disease of having one good song on an album. The rest of the album is unoriginal, and just not up to par with the first track from the album that I had fallen in love with. If you are contemplating buying this album, save yourslef the money and download ""Waiting Room"" instead."
4,Malox,Good product - very effective. Have used this product for years but it is no longer available at local drugstores - they only carry their own brand.
4,Devlin Book's captivating...,"I love Patricia Bray's books, but this book was and remains my favorite. I think what I loved about it is the vulnerability of the Devlin's character. He is a true leader with no desire to lead. Once he realizes he may have no choice in the matter, he accepts his fate and throws himself into it full tilt. Bray manages to paint a great picture of the land and time Devlin lives in, but her true abilities lie in character development. I think anyone would love these books, I was actually disappointed when I was done reading the series, I didn't want it to be over."
1,Book was defective,Book may have been okay but I got lost when reading page 25. It did not make any sense until I looked and saw that pages 345 thru 376 were in place of pages 25 thru 56. Anyone else have this problem with Bantan Books?
1,Devlin's Honor,Slooooooow reading. Lingers on and on. Extremely predictable. Big let down compared to the first book. Seems to be a trend with author's to continue a series without a true storyline in order to sell more books. Shame on you Patricia.
3,Not quite a three hour tour....,"I was hoping for more. The first book in the series, ""Devlin's Luck"", was quite good and showed a lot of promise. Unfortunately the author gave less in this second novel than she did in the first. Very simplistic plotting and superficial characterizations, combined with a large font make this book a quick read. Albeit an enjoyable one. Save this one for reading on an airplane and if you want something with more meat to it, go check out Michelle West's latest book. Ms. Bray has some good ideas and a very pleasant writing style, but her follow through is a bit weak."
3,Psychology of Tournament Golf,"The four CDs contain a lot of truth about golf, needing to be 'in the moment' and not focusing on outcomes. The presentation is an audio of a group information session, and thus the four CDs take a long time to play through."
1,WTF???,"I dont own this and still i can come to the conclusion, WHY THE H*** WOULD ANYONE WANT THIS??? this is mario party guide, since when do you need a list of minigames and tips, you could get that anywhere, this is a waste of money, only get it if its free in some garage sale."
2,The Premise of David's Echatology Books is Wrong,"Of course, this is based on personal opinion. I love and respect many of David's other books, but his books on eschatology (and those of Tim Lehaye) are patently wrong. Any person who says that the Tribulation is 7 years long - well, let's just ask: where does it say that in the Bible? It doesn't. Oh, Daniel talks about the 70th week, yes. But no where does it say, or imply, that the 70th week and THE Tribulation are the same. No Christian before the early 1800's (almost 2000 years worth of followers of Jesus) ever taught that. Oh, there are vague references, when take out of context, from Clement of Rome and Origen. Even Kay Arthur (who is a pre-trib believer) doesn't think the Tribulation starts before the Abomination of Desolation (tho she does hint, 20 years ago, that the Rapture is at the beginning of the 70th week). So, David Jeremiah is good - and he's a wonderful Christian, but he's mistaken about eschatology."
5,must have to study Revelations,This was the most exciting and revealing of the books I have read on the last days before the return of Christ and the tribulation times.If you are studing Revelations this is a must read.
3,Escape the Coming Night,This book appears to be written from a head knowledge of studying rather than from God given spiritual insight. I do not particularly agree with some of Dr. Jeremiahs views as stated in this book. I would not recommend it to anyone to further their knowledge about the end times.
5,Escape the Coming Night,Ordered these for Sunday School class. Was very happy with service & the books are terrific!
4,making it clear,great book - all 3 read by jeramiah in reverse order of publcation.... yet consistent with explanations only more details involved as the prophecy is revealed. really really enjoyed reading (oldest of the 3)
5,An inspiration for all ages!,"Racing Against the Clock is a precious gift for anyone who sees it. Although we may not all aspire to being competitive athletes, the movie is a tribute to the extent of human possibility and the power of will and the power of positive choice. The filmmakers approach their subjects with admiration but also with a realism that avoids fawning, I work with many older adults as their physician, and wish that all my patients could see this film. It is one of the best I've seen.Charles H. Weiss MD"
3,"Great sound, but same-ish","I bought this CD after seeing Megan open up for Kathleen Edwards in San Francisco. I was really impressed with her sound, her stage presence, and how the cover of 'Modern Love' stuck in my mind.On first listen, the CD has a great sound and I was captivated by Megan's voice and the sound of the lap steel. But...after a few listens I found myself getting bored with the sound a few songs in. That is the only problem with this CD: the songs all sound very similar in sound, arrangement and tempo. A little variation in instrumentation and arrangements would have gone a long way to making this a great CD.I look forward to what she comes up with in the future and will go see her live again if she comes to town."
3,"Pleasing, but lacks emotional range","I find this CD a fresh musical wave in a sea of mind-numbing pop. Like others here I bought this because I heard their cover of ""Modern Love"" and was wowed. Indeed, the vocals and haunting instrumentation on many of these songs are a winning combination. Overall, it's a pleasant CD that works well as background or for quieter moments when you can focus more on the subtle complexities. However, I find that the lead singer's vocals don't change; her emotional expression is static. Quite like Margo Timmins in Cowboy Junkies -- after a while I want to switch to another CD. I admit I am drawn to vocals and I value singers, like Rufus Wainwright, who convey their interpretation of a song via a wider range."
1,Not as you would expect...,"We had received a lambskin for our newborn and he loves it so much, we decided to order a spare. This was a poor choice. I was lured by the price, but you get what you pay for. The fur is straight, not curly and soft, and it really looks like a dog pelt. And that's just too creepy."
1,worse with age?,"each release seems to be getting worse and worse. i can't say anything good about this album. Maybe they should spend a little time on quality, not quantity of new releases.. don't waste your money."
2,Jobst supportwear therapeutic support,Tried this product for a few times. The first time was fine but after washing they would not stay in place.
4,Better Than Expected,"I wasn't looking forward to having to wear ""support stockings"" - but these really are not bad. They are more sheer than I was expecting and very comfortable. They stay up all day long. I definitely plan to order more."
2,It keep fall down,I have no idea if my size is wrong or the product is not tight enough. It keeps fall down.
1,Stockings don't stay up. Horrible customer service!,"The stockings don't stay up even though I ordered the correct size according to measurement guidelines. Furthermore, I am extremely disappointed in the seller's customer service! The first time I contacted them to return the item, I was informed that they don't accept returns, only exchanges. When I asked who would be paying for shipping, the response I received was ""you received this item shipped for free""-rude and unhelpful. After I complained to Amazon's customer service and they wrote to the seller, the seller responded that ""the item is a stocking and can't be defective""-again, rude and unhelpful-stockings that don't stay up are clearly defective as there is an issue with the elastic band. I will never buy anything from this seller again!"
1,Disappointed,"The product looks nice when I opened the package. When I used it, the thigh high compression socks rolled down below my knees while I was walking. Thank goodness I was still at home. That would have been an embarassment if it happened in a public place. I am very dissapointed. But the lower part was stable and comfortable."
2,Hose,Good product but thigh band not tight enough allowing them to slip down to knees. Size is critical. Would recommend with this qualification.
2,slips down,"These support hose do not stay up, they start out fine but then slip down the leg as you move about."
4,Effective compression and relatively comfortable,"I bought these stockings because I'm a vet student in my 30s, so I'm on my feet for 12-16 hours a day on clinical rotations, and my husband and I are expecting our first child so I was worried about varicose veins.The stockings are more comfortable than some other pairs I've tried, and continue to stay up exactly where I put them on even after multiple wears and washes. They're not as effective at compression as some of the other brands I've tried, but my legs and feet still feel MUCH less tired at the end of the day when I wear them than when I just wear regular socks. They really make a distinct difference. And, I'm 6 months pregnant and so far (knock wood!) haven't gotten any bulging veins!"
3,Cirrculation,This is not my first purchase. Wish they were cheaper!!My mother has bad cirrculation in her legs. She likes to go to church and other placesso when I found these amazing looking and feeling stockings right off the internet I boughtthem and she will not wear any other. They were bought for a nurse and other ladies inher neghbour hood too!!
4,great for nurses!,suffered from tired achy legs and varicose veins. these stockings definitely helped. wore them for the 1st time for 3 straight shifts and usually my legs are beat tired from 1 12 hr shift. these stockings definitely worked. you feel the slight compression but not to the point it was uncomfortable. and surprisingly they stayed up all night. i had no problem with it falling if i needed to run or walk quickly. I recommend this product.
1,itchy top band,"These stockings seemed great in the beginning. they gave me just the right amount of support, however after a few days i developed a rash right where the sticky part of the top band is. it was really itchy and i ended up with a red bumpy rash. i can't wear them now at all not even 10 min. i must have an allergy to the sticky stuff they use."
4,super product!,I have to wear these compression stockings to keep the swelling down in my legs and feet. I have purchased lots of brands but these are the best quality for the money spent. I need a couple more pair. I will definitely buy them through Amazon its easier that way. It is hard to find thigh highs that actually stay UP!
3,Not as supportive as I thought,"I got these because I was having varicose veins problems during my pregnancy and needed more than one pair. They look a lot better than the one I had bought before (better color, more sheer), but they're also a lot less supportive than the first one I got. But then again, they are less pricey, so I guess you get what you pay for.If you're not having serious varicose veins issues, I think they're good enough."
5,Fabulous,"I have a old, arthritic knee and these stockings are the best thing that I've found. The knee is now in much better condition and I am not experiencing the edema that I was before using.Definitely would recommend."
2,"Larger than espected, and not supporting at all","I'm 23 weeks pregnant, and I need to use therapeutic support socks. I got these because of the good reviews I red on Amazon, but I'm really disappointed. The foot is longer than it should be, and the elastic doesn't stay up, unless you just sit... I've being using other brands and these are not even close to be supportive, nor I can feel any good compression. I also double checked the size I ordered, thinking I may have chosen the wrong one, but nope, the size is right, they are just larger. I would use them as normal socks if it wasn't that the elastic doesn't stay up at all. I contact the company to send them back, but they told me they do not accept returns, they can just change the product."
3,OK,"Too lose on my thigh, so they fall down. Very annoying thing. The knee highs are great, but these need some work."
1,wrong compression!,"Not the right compression, never stated what type. not happy with this purchase. wish I would have bought something else"
2,My wife wore those only once and they got a run,"Well, they look nice on woman's leg and as my wife says they mostly do the trick of keeping veins in place, but as for durability - they got a hole the second day she put them on."
4,support hose,"My first time wearing support hose, found these comfortable. This pair was not to short or to long. I would purchase another pair of Jobst."
2,Too much trash,"Starts out with classics from lion king, Little Mermaid, Aladin, and Beauty & the Beast, then slides down hill into garbage from straight to video sequels. Definitely not on par with most of the other Sing Along Songs discs.Also, instead of cartoon transitions between songs, like the others in the series, it is just a narrators voice saying the song title. This breaks up the flow pretty noticeably."
3,Not so 'Classic',"Growing up with the more 'classic' sing along song VHS, I was excited to share songs I grew up with and loved. But upon getting it in the mail for my little one, I was disappointed. The songs weren't those of the original movies. And the DVD only lasts 32 mins TOPS. I know it was a while ago, but I'm pretty sure the VHS version lasted twice as long with twice as many songs. Seems to me like they took one Sing Along Songs movie classics from VHS and split it into 3 DVD movies. Out of the dvd lion king, jungle book, and peter pan- I prefer the Peter pan DVD more, it has much more of the original version of sing along songs to it. The singing bird in the beginning of the dvd and all."
4,I used to watch this series as a kid,"The old Disney Sing Along Songs videos were classic. My little sister and I loved them and now my daughters enjoy them. They like some of the songs on this modern version, but they dont yet know all the movies the songs are from. They'll appreciate this more as they get a little older (they're only a pre-schooler and toddler)."
2,My son didn't' really like this,"My son didn't really like the video and I was a little disappointed too. I thought (due to the cover of the DVD) the videos would be more of that new computer animation, not the old style cartoons. I think its really based what you like and are expecting. I was thinking the cartoons would look more like the new Mickey Mouse Clubhouse cartoons and it doesn't. The old school cartoons just don't capture my 2 year old's attention."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"It is 6/3/09 and ordered this DVD on 5/2/09 and still have not recieved the DVD. I contacted them and suposively they are going to ship it ""again."" Never will go through them again!"
2,A Puzzling Mix,"Not a bad video, if you don't mind exposing your impressionable young child to jarringly racist depictions of Arabs (Prince Ali) and Asians (Everybody Wants To Be A Cat). These disturbing stereotypes seem particularly inexplicable when sandwiched between such gems as Circle Of Life and When You Wish Upon A Star. Not exactly consistent with the squeaky clean image Disney so aggressively cultivates."
4,Spanish/French tracks,"The thing I like about this one is that it has sing-alongs in both Spanish and French. The music and the words on the screen are in that language. As a French and Spanish teacher, I can say that my students really enjoy this DVD (yeah, high school kids!) and since they already know the songs, they can start to sing along immediately.The list of songs is not exactly the same in each language, though, and ironically, the French section has MORE songs than the Spanish. Almost all the songs are there for both languages and they have a completely separate section for them so you can use the ALL PLAY feature and play all the songs through automatically (all in French or all in Spanish) or choose one individual one to use. I've not been able to find any other Disney sing-alongs like this one with the other two languages (there's a Winnie the Pooh, but it only has a Spanish track)."
3,Ok,Would of liked some more top songs ... Its ok though my son really only like a few but maybe the others will grow on him
5,Love Disney Sing Along Songs!,"Disney's Sing Along Songs are great for toddlers. They have songs from popular Disney movies. Each song is just long enough to keep their attention without being too long. When they get old enough to read, they can read the words on the screen while singing along. My kids loved these when they were little and here I find almost 20 years later buying them for my grandchild.."
1,The Lion King Sing Along,What I didn't like about this is the sing along was too fast and also the narrator that announced the songs sounded like he was tired and didn't care. My son usually won't move a muscle when a sing along is in and this one he walked away from several times.
4,Fun,I enjoy listening to it while I drive and keeps my toddler's attention for a little while. Nice song selection.
5,An earthquake to vain ritualism and observances.,"This book does two things at the same time: 1) It shows clearly the intrinsic value, worth and wonder of our precious Jesus, and 2) It exposes how some of the ritualistic things we THOUGHT were as important as Christ, simply are not. The contrast between Christ as a living and resurrected person, and the religion that often disguises itself as the Savior, is repeatedly shown in wonderful and enlightening examples, and biblical exposition.I believe that once a person has read this book, they will see Christ more clearly as the living God, and see religion as mere activity (whether needed or not) around Him. One cannot help but think differently and more carefully after reading ""Christ vs. Religion""."
1,Not in Stock,The product I ordered was not in stock and they had no information as to when it will be available.
3,Box wave I Pad protector,"This product is pretty much as described.. It seems like a decent protector. The thing that I don't like is the way the protector fits around the screen, it doesn't lay flat to the glass.. it raises at the edges in center of each edge of the screen. It is very functional and I have it on until I can find a better solution. Basically it just looks and fits a bit sloppy around the screen, the back fits perfectly....Hope this helps"
3,i was happy,i was happy with the item. Especially since i had to go through two websites. i thought it was going to get mixed up. Everything ran smoothly and got to me in a timely manner.
2,"Save your money, find another book","Waste of time and money, there was almost no information, not a Zippo in sight, all odd ball lighters, no details just quickie price information including sections on matches, holders and other non-lighter items. We needed a price guide to lighters, and this was not it. The only thing big about it, well there was nothing big about it, as a matter of fact there was not a big value, or even a big book, much smaller than most price guides."
1,Too Many Hokey Stats,"If you're a baseball stats junky (like me), how can this not be the perfect book?They decided to add a whole bunch of hokey stats, while leaving out some of the vital one's. Come on guys...""adjusted"" batting averages instead of pinch hitting stats? A seperate section for (incomplete) post-season stats, rather than listing them with regular season stats?Let's bet back to basics and skip the nonsense!"
2,It swings and misses!,"After visiting the Total Baseball website, and reading glowing reviews by others who read the book, I was hopeful that Total Baseball would be the end-all of statistical tomes. I was completely disappointed. Fielding statistics are almost non-existant. Hitting and pitching stats are pared down to a bare minimum of the common ones. The web site carries more thorough batting and pitching stats for free. I guess now that Total Baseball is the official book of Major League Baseball, they decided to do away with the effort that got them there in the first place. This wouldn't be the first time people got lazy once they figured they were all that. I was so disgusted that I returned the book. I wish they would put the complete batting, pitching, and fielding stats on a CD and sell it, and get rid of this annoying piece of weight training equipment. At least put a handle on it for easier carrying!"
5,Simplicity...,"All I can say is that Jennifer Knapp has it... she has the most down to earth talent that an every day Christian can identify with, and cherish.I've never written a review before, and I don't pretend to call this a review. The only words that seem fitting are, inspiring, honest, introspective, and phenominal. This artist surpases the gumball effect of the Newsboys, and other surreal Christian artists. I am not saying that others (including the Newsboys) aren't good nor inspiring, but Ms. Knapp simply has the talent, the melodies, the stories that make you feel why being a Christian is truly the real deal.js"
1,Hank would be spinning in his grave.,"I guess this movie comes under the description of ""rarity""- one of Hathaway's famous Zane Grey Paramount Bs.HOWEVER- I don't think I have ever seen a worse copy on DVD of ANY film! Every few minutes there is a jump-cut as an average of about 150 frames is missing. What remains of the rest of the copy is scratched faded and downright filthy. My DVD of ""To the Last Man"" is pretty poor but if THIS copy had ever run at a kid's Saturday Matinee there would have been a riot! BE WARNED! Put the cost of this abortion toward a DVD of Hathaway's ""Shepherd of the Hills""if you haven't already got it.Now that's a masterpiece in a great transfer-and Betty Field is a knockout!."
2,"Video quality poor, but audio quality far worse.","The video quality on this movie is poor, but what you should expect for a movie of this age that is not remastered. The audio quality on the other hand is very poor, for there is a loud and constant scratching sound throughout the entire movie, like that made on an old turntable before or after a song is played. This is the first DVD that forced me to turn the treble on my TV all of the way down in order to drown out as much of the scratching sound as possible so that I could hear the dialogue, and I have a great many westerns on the DVD format that are as old or older than this one with far better audio. I believe that with modern day equipment the manufacturer of this DVD could have nearly eliminated the constant scratching sound in the audio with little effort or expense."
4,A real boon for office workers!,"I'm at my desk for upwards of eight hours a day, and by the time I leave for home my back and shoulders can feel twenty years older than the rest of me. This cushion alleviates the discomfort a lot. I just purchased my third one--for me they have a lifespan of about one year before they get too flattened to work well. I've never tried any other memory foam cushions simply because this one is so much more inexpensive than most. My only real complaint is that the hinge that holds the two parts together always ends up breaking apart after 8-9 months, although the cushions are still usable. The included carrying bag feels like it's made of dryer sheet material and rips as easily--I just don't use it. All in all, though, I love this cushion. It's a great conversation piece too: people always want to try it out, and then they always ask me where to get one!"
4,Short and Sweet.,"Selove's memoir is short and sweet. I especially liked the style of writing, which seems to match and convey her nonchalant but passionate outlook on life. The book is short and to-the-point. It's honest and thought-provoking.The obstacles that she faced as a physicist may not be as pertinent today, but they still do exist. The book would provide an excellent read for male and female students and faculty members at major science institutions, especially physics departmental personnel.I recommend the book to anyone who has the chance to read it!"
4,God has more than one way to reach people...,"I was delighted to find this Bible. I was raised as a Christian, but, truth be told, did not want to read the Bible. When I saw this version, I *wanted* to read it.Don't let someone else dictate to you what you should read--least of all someone who tries to put a ""proper"" spin on things.God is not about ""proper""; rather, He simply wants you to receive His message. Legalistic ""Christians"" will never understand this, and that is their sad loss."
3,"Wrong, but funny.","It may not be an accurate translation of the Bible, it may even be straight up WRONG, but it was pretty funny to read."
5,God's Baadasssss Word,"Imagine if Donald Goines, or Iceberg Slim wrote an interpretation of the Bible. It would look a lot like this. This is the most readable version of the bible I've found so far."
1,This Bible is an insult,I found this interpretation of the bible to be an insult to the African-American community. Are we so unable to understand the writings of the bible that there must be an interpretation from the underbelly of the African-American society.
4,Trumper Sandalwood Tube,"This product has the same consistency as other high end shaving creams and delivers a closer shave than any grocery store cream. It smells like sandalwood and leaves a pleasant smell after shaving. Just in case you are not familiar with sandalwood (as I was), it is the same scent that Old Spice uses. My wife told me ""duh""."
1,The worst scent ever...,"Smells like a heavy smoker. I tried the Geo F. Trumper shaving cream in Lime scent and really liked it. When I ran out I decided to give the Sandalwood scent a try. Awful. If your a three-pack-a-day smoker then you'll probably love this scent. Otherwise, stay away."
1,Bad Bogart film,"The premise of the film is very interesting. But this is the worst of the Bogart movies I've seen. This movie is badly written. Bogarts wise cracks are badly timed within the dialog- it seem the line should be funny within the context of the dialog, but the lines instead seem isolated from the tone and emotion, adding nothing to the scenes.There are many problems with the editing. There are several places where they seemed to have ran out of film or had no pickup shots.Hollywood should remake this film... they can only improve on it.There are plenty of good Bogart films out there, this is not one of them."
1,Do not see this movie!!,"If you liked the Maltese Falcon or The Big Sleep then don't see this movie. The direction and writing are terrible. The first 15 minutes of the movie is done as first person with only Bogarts voice - which is extremely distracting. Once you actually see Bogey it doesn't really matter. You aren't invested in the characters and there is no plot. The story goes on for almost 3/4 of the movie before anything worth while caring about happens and when it does it is so poorly written you are more relieved than satisfied because you know that soon the movie will be over. There only a few actual tense moments in the movie, the last 20 minutes, and the final one is so stupid as to be laughable. I felt like I was watching a first year film student film. You know the kind - the director does such obvious camera and plot work that it IS obvious the message they are trying to send and as such you feel dumber for having watched it."
1,You gotta be kidding.,"People, what the hell have you been smoking? Did you actually watch this wildly improbable stinker or did you just hear about it at a party: ""Bogart-Bacall, wow!, etc."" C'mon, crap is crapno matter who is starring."
3,Surreal Bogart,"This must be one of the most idiotic plots ever produced by a major American studio, and yet the acting is so good it's not only watchable but enjoyable. From the momemt escaping convict Humphrey Bogart rolls himself off the back of a truck in a garbage can at, say, 35 miles per hour and lives to tell about it, not one incident has a single shred of believability. But the Hollywood studio system could make a silk purse out of even this sow's ear. The acting, locations, production values and Delmer Daves' direction of his ludicrous script are all first rate. Which equals one of those intriguingly bad movies that sometimes are more interesting than good ones."
3,Lesser Bogart / Bacall Film,"Dark Passage is the least well known of the Humphrey Bogart/Lauren Bacall films, and with good reason, since it is not of the same quality as their other three films. Bogart plays Vincent, a man wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of his wife, who escapes and is greatly aided by Irene (Bacall), a woman familiar with his case who believes his innocence. Bogart remains out of camera range for the first part of the movie, and is then covered with bandages following surgery to alter some of his facial features. The story is somewhat far fetched, and the climax seems a bit rushed. Bogart and Bacall give good enough performances, and Agnes Moorehead pulls out all the stops as Madge, the shrew that has complicated both of their lives. The film is entertaining, but it's not up to the level of their other films."
4,Interesting Bogart...,"This is a little different for Bogart and Bacall, but I found it quite interesting and worth the watch for sure. The premise of the movie dictates that you don't see Bogart's face till quite a ways into the movie, and it's very interesting to see the movie work with that angle. Overall, I think that even weaker movies by Bogart and Bacall are great! This may not be non-stop intensity, but it's still exciting."
3,"Not Bogart's best, but little is.","The other reviewers are pretty accurate with their reviews, but maybe a little harsh.Parts of this movie don't work. At least, they don't work now, maybe they worked fifty years ago. The revelation of the central mystery is unsatisfying, and some of the character relationships are unbelievable.But so much does work! Eighty percent of this movie, the great camerawork, Bogart's plight up to and even after the plastic surgery, the young tough who wants to move up in the world. Yeah, it isn't Casablanca, to have and have not, or treasure of sierra madre. But it's fairly darn good, and one Bogart's top ten. For a noir or Bogart fan, it is a must see."
4,Riveting...,"Dark Passage is classic Humphrey Bogart! Suspenseful, romantic, and plenty of last minute twists. The beginning is fascinating! You do not see H.B. face for the first 30min. of the film. A must see for any suspense/mystery fan. Well done..."
2,"Great Film, Lousy Sound! We've Been Bagged Again...","Terrific film with Bogie and Bacall, love it, but not the sound quality. During the credits the sound and music were great. Once the film started we had to keep increasing the volume. It is not our system, it is the DVD's sound reproduction that lacks. This is not the first vintage film rerecorded on DVD that hasn't measured up with regard to sound quality."
5,Great Bogie Movie,"I love this movie! I watched it first on PBS, but it's one of the greatest ones with Bogie and Bacall in it!"
4,Bowled over,"I was bowled over by this forgotten piece of Forties High Style, wacky and quirky and unpredictable as it is. Yes, the idea of subjective camera for the first third of the film was campy and too much, and certainly neither Bogey nor Bacall added significantly to the allure established elsewhere. The Waxman musical score is great, though, and the supporting cast, and the lines and situations they are given!, is brilliant, one of the best ever. The couple Bogey overhears at the train station! The plainclothes cop with all the weird questions in the diner! And, above all, the cabbie driver and his wild stories about goldfish and the seven hills of San Francisco! I laughed with delight all the way through, and I readily forgive the film that it is no straightforward thriller. So much the better!"
4,Bogey & Bacall at their best !,"Warner's Dark Passage (1947)together with The Big Sleep (1946) imho is the best teaming of the on/off legendary screen couple Humphrey Bogart & Lauren Bacall, the chemistry they project in the scenes they're together is awesome.Delmer Daves direction is efficient -with excelent shots of the San Francisco locations- and the script is very original.Agnes Moorehead and Tom D'Andrea shine in their supporting roles.A highly recommended film."
5,a must see movie,"i'm not going to sum it up for you, just read any movie encyclopedia for this, but this movie is a masterpiece. Lauren bacall is wonderful, and you really don't have to be a fan of any of them to love this movie, i taped it from tnt and i keep watching it, it's a timeless movie"
4,A mystery with a love affair,"The man in the bandaged face, the taxi cab driver with the quickieface job (plastic surgery) friend and the trash can escape from San Quentin.I didn't know how frail and thin the tough guy Bogart wasuntil I saw this movie with older eyes. The acting, plot and 40's San Francisco made this very good viewing. The music wasn't as goodas some of these films, but there is a chemistry herthat time hasn't erased."
4,"Dark Horse, But a Winner","The best of black-and-white films are such that the viewer forgets very quickly that there is no color. If truly good, it will impart a style and an atmosphere that color can't duplicate. By 1947, when this movie was made, there wasn't much that a major studio couldn't do superbly in B/W. All their talent has been transferred to this DVD.The premise for this movie is indeed improbable, and the idea that someone would want to change into the Bogart time-worn face is laughable. However, the interplay between the Bogarts is electric, and she never looked any sexier. The San Francisco art deco buildings and scenery is an added bonus. Agnes Moorhead, certainly one of our most underrated radio and film actresses, was never better as the catty friend. As a variation of film noir, though, this is fun to watch and gets better with each viewing."
2,Don't buy it for the Belfegore,"I bought this to get Belfegore's ""All that I Wanted,"" which is seemingly impossible to obtain elsewhere. I hoped against hope that the remix would be close to the original, but it is not: disappointing. The other mixes are even less appealing. If you like remixes, perhaps it is worth money; I don't, so it was not."
2,A bit boring.,"I think this author has a good future and has written a decent book, but there is just no substance. There is no suspense, no mystery, and not much of a story. Eventhough he spends a great deal of time with his characters you really dont get to know them and in most cases they are in many cases unlikeable. There is one section 3/4 through the book which was very incestual and disgusting and did not lend anything to the story. I think if he takes more time to develop a REAL story, he has great potential as a writer. This book was 3.99 on kindle so it's a bargain and was obviously enjoyed by at least 7 very positive reviewers. However, it completely felt flat to me."
3,Hidden in Plain View,Hidden in Plain View (Darryl Billups Mysteries)Not the best mystery I ever read but tolerable. A newspaper manager becomes detective after the death of two black citizens in his city. The police department has no clues as to the cause or suspect of the murders. This became a personal issue for the man who had won an award for another story and he did not want his city of Baltimore going without solving murders of black citizens. The story leads him to Atlanta where he becomes entangled with the murderer and is unsuccessful at apprehending the suspect. Back to Baltimore and the love of his life as he becomes more involved with the police in solving the mystery.
3,View of Hidden in Plain View,Interesting enough to make me read the whole thing. But not much substance to it. Interesting plot but no decent development.
1,Disappointed in Denver,This author gets 1 star for the story line. I believe he is a bigot if you are not a person of color. All his characters are black of some other color other than white. The one or two white characters did not get described well.t Won't be reading any more of his writing.
5,Hidden in Plain View,"This book held my complete interest. I did not want to put it down, but when forced to, I could not stop thinking about what was happening. This book will hold the interest of anyone who enjoys reading, especially mysteries. The book was not too long nor too short and it held my interest throughout, until the end. I told my friends about it and suggested they purchase a copy.Darryl, keep up the good writing."
4,DifferentKindofMystery,"While this book is not your typical mystery or ""who donit"", it keeps you guessing. Even after getting to know the killer, you wanted find out what was going to happen next. The only thing I didn't like about the book is, it just stopped and disengaged you from the main character. I wanted a little more at the end. Over all good book, I'm looking forward to the next book."
4,Eccentric romance novel,"OVER BEMERTON'S is a romance novel centering on a fifty-five yearold bachelor who has returned to London after spending thirty years in Buenos Aires, Argentina and who takes up rooms overBemerton's secondhand bookshop. The author, E.V. Lucas, as a young man worked in a secondhand bookshop. Lucas went on to write a number of novels and books of essays. He also edited the Letters of Charles and Mary Lamb. Lucas was a bibliophile and that interest is inherent in this novel. The chapters of the novel often have vignettes that read like little essays. The various characters of the novel are cleverly intertwined, which adds cohesion to the plot. Lucas cannot be described as Christianin his viewpoint but the novel does reflect Victorian values.The book was first published in 1908."
3,They are invading... again,"Mostly a martial arts film with a beautiful female alien,all flame tattooed with a chain whipand an innocent young girl who fixates on the agent herowho is trying to prevent the ancient race with the dying sun frommoving in and taking over Earth. Really with global warmingno sane alien race would want this place?It appears in the end he manages to blow up the gate ...another 'B' sci fi film that isn't too bad.I enjoyed it."
3,I've seen worse..,"First off, I like Marc Dacascos, he's usually pretty good in his movies. He's good in this film too, but Alien Agent suffers from a miniscule budget and a re-treaded plot. The Hidden, Dark Breed, The Silencers are just a few of the movies that have used the ""Alien Cop"" motif; and had bigger budgets.All in all, Alien Agent is a mildly pleasing diversion, don't expect much and you won't be disappointed."
1,DVD would not play.,"This dvd would not play, so I ordered a second one which also would not play. I have two very good players and neither would play either of the two discs.I suspect they are not region one usable and if so the vender should have stated so in his listing,.I have tried to find an address for this vender to no avail, so have given up.Charline Hutton cgreenhut@comcast.net"
4,Shirley is Forever,"This is a reasonably good concert, although I was at her 60th birthday concert (at the same time this concert was taped) and it was much better. That should have been released on DVD.The interruption of the behind the scenes material is obtrusive, and could have been refined to a separate section of the disc - or even placed on side B.It is inextricable to me why this is the only representative of Shirley on DVD. This disc is all very well, but why not have some complete (unedited) concert releases, or the BBC TV series from the 1970s?This is a good start, but Shirley's artistry could, and should, be much better represented in this medium."
3,"Dated, but a Classic","I own the original, German version of this book (""Wo große Weine wachsen"", I think it's called--circa 1974.) I am glad to have this book because it's a classic in its field, but quite dated. It contains considerable information for a few well-known and high-quality wine estates in Germany, as they were then, and is good to have as a reference. It's possible that the information has been updated in the English version, which I have not seen."
5,Auntie Pris,"This is my most cherished guitar song book. These books have been to church, school, on camping trips, at barbeques, and everywhere we wanted music. I have two prior editions, the brown cover and the fuscia cover, and they are in shreds from the heavy use they have been subjected to over the years. I was beginning to panic because I had been unable to find it locally. To avoid this problem in the future I just ordered four more. You cannot go wrong ordering this song book."
4,"If you love the Police, you'll love Maxeen","They're probably sick of the comparison by now, but Maxeen evokes early Police. It's their own fault, they're a 3-piece with a lead singer/bassist. The bottom line? Great songs well played. Tom's vocals are unique - slightly off-putting at first, they've got a nasal timbre and almost a bit of a whine - but his desperate, passionate performances and pure vocal horsepower overcome the flaws and make a fan out of you after two songs. His ""beautifully defective voice"" resides somewhere in the category with Geddy Lee and Elvis Costello."
4,A moving love story with beautiful performances,"I was really surprised that this film film did so bad at the box office. I mean it gave a chance to Robert Redford to not play Robert Redford again. As Siskel (god bless him) and Ebert said this film is a burried treasure. It has a great story and becautiful sceneries and performances. There was a lot of chemistry between Redford and Olin and they are good together. For those who complained about lack of chemistry watch Horse Whisperer with Redford. Now, that is a film with no chemistry among leads. I particulary enjoyed the last scene when Redford gets out of his car in front of the beach and looks at horizon hoping for Bobby to show up. But he knows she is not coming. It was an unjustice not to give Raul Julia credit. I don't why they did that. But he was very good. I think in time this film will be rediscovered. Frankly, I enjoyed this much better than Out of Africa which I found slow and non involving."
1,WORST Movie I've EVER SEEN!!!,"The acting is terrible!!! (Redford should have hung up his spurs after the ""Sting""!) The dialogue is Terrible!!! The Directing is terrible!!!!!!!! The pace and tempo are out of wack. They must have spent all their budget on Redford and shiny old cars rather than story, direction, continuity, and production. AND yet there was so much potential. My frustration is unbearable!!!Any movie I can think of is better than ""Havana""!!! Try ""LA Confidential"", ""Chinatown"", ""Casablanca"", in fact any Bogart movie...the list is endless!!! I'd recommend my five year old's ""Dumbo"" ahead of ""Havana"".AHAH!!! I just had a stroke of genius!!! Redford crash lands his Gulfstream V in remote Africa and loses his ability to speak, and the chimps nuture him back to health. The name of the movie, ""The Homo Sapien Whisperer""."
4,Better than I expected,"This is really a beautiful movie on several levels. The sets and atmosphere really do seem to capture the feel of pre-revolution Havana. Redford is quite good in the lead, although I was less impressed Lena Olin as a leading lady. She seemed a bit stiff in many scenes and I wasn't as convinced that a hard core gambler and pleasure seeker like Redford's character would be so quick to fall for her. I thought that Raul Julia was great in a relatively small part.The movie really was more about atmospherics for me than anything to do with the love story. I enjoyed the depiction of Havana and the decadence of it's nightlife as well as the growing threat of violence as the rebels approach. The night of the government's fall is very similar to the scene from Godfather II including people smashing parking meters, etc.All in all I would recommend this for those interested in Cuba during that period."
4,"Loved it then, love it now","I absolutely loved this film when it was first released in 1990. I thought it was terribly underrated, and was disappointed when I learned that it got some negative reviews. The performances by Redford and Olin were understated and wonderful. I thought they worked well together. The music alone is worth the price of admission. I purchased the sound track on cassette, and played it to death. Today this movie was shown on AMC and I, once again, was mesmerized by all of it. Now Olin is gaining some fame again on the TV show,""Alias"" as Jenifer Garner's mother. She is as beautiful as ever. Havana is a great flick-----buy it and see for yourself!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not thrilled,"I got this for my husband. He has some back issues and the Chiropractor recommended to do Pilates/ core strengthening. He found it too difficult. I thought it was a little tough for a beginner - maybe I need a Pilates for Dummies. Anyway, I think the video got watched once."
1,"Worst ""workout"" and ""instructor"" EVER!","This was by far the most irritating dvd I have ever used. Instead of having a brief introduction that explains the proper breathing techniques and form, she literally talks nonstop throughout each movement and constantly stops the people demonstrating the moves to explain the ""right"" and ""wrong"" way of doing the current move. This is a total joke if you are wanting an actual workout.After watching the first ten minutes without her having you do anything, I became totally bored and I don't think she actually did any of the moves herself. She just sat on a chair in the center and talked, and talked, and talked! I used to use the Living Arts Pilates vhs tapes with Ana Caban as the instructor, but when I compared the reviews, I decided to switch to Jennifer Kries. Big mistake! I just ordered Ana Caban's Pilates dvds and will be using hers instead!"
5,Move over Mary Higgins Clark!,"Move over Mary Higgins Clark, Laura Bradford is on the scene! In Forecast of Evil, she even tops her previous book, Jury of One, which was nominated for an Agatha best first novel. A tough heroine and her love interest match wits with a devious murderer while battling a blizzard and some demons from the past to succeed in the end. A story with turns and twists on every page. If you love Mary Higgins Clark, you'll doubly love Laura Bradford's fresh new series. And be sure to read Jury of One, too."
1,Manufacturer does not stand by product,"The concept is good. There are many mechanical problems with the .The ""touchscreen"" should be renamed the ""hit-screen"", as I found it difficult to touch it...I had to press very hard to get it to work. My son, who is only 7 months old, cannot make it work.My son enjoyed it from 3-6 months, until it broke. The screen froze and the motor kept on trying to rotate the picture. I took the batteries out and back in again, and it still didn't work.I called the Discovery Channel and they said because it was not bought from them, I would have to contact the store who sold it to me. I contacted Tuesday Morning, and they had a 45 day return policy and said to contact the manufacturer. For a $80 toy, Discover Channel should have some type of warranty...I still have the receipt and box and they wouldn't do anything. For a toy that is less than 6 months old and in great condition, I think this is very unfair. I will never but from them again."
2,Did Not Meet Expectations,"We hoped this would be a fun, stimulating toy for our then 10 month old. Christmas morning came, we tried it, and the touch-screen buttons didn't work. Received a new one and the buttons worked but only if you pressed very hard on one particular spot. Also, there is not a lot going on, gets boring and redundant very fast."
1,DON'T BUY THIS,"I HAD TO WRITE A REVIEW.. I GOT THIS AS A GIFT.. AND JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE NO RECIEPT.. WELL THE PRODUCT TURNED ON FOR 1 SECOND.. I CHANGED THE BATTERIES AND IT DID THE SAME THING.. BULL.. AND DISCOVERY LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WONT DO SHIT.. THIS IS BULL.. IT HARD EFFORT HAVING A BABY TO CARE FOR, NEVER MIND HAVING COMPANYS DO THIS SHIT."
4,up to snuff,"I'm a big fan of the idiot's guides since they are always clear and easy to follow. The authors do an excellent job of explaining complex terms and concepts so even an ordinary person can understand the reasons behind drafting a will. After reading this book, you'll see that you'll want to do everything you can so that you do not find yourself ""intestate"" -- then the state fights over what belongs to whom. Although it's difficult to think about dying, it's even worse to think about having all your money thrown to taxes or tied up in court as relatives fight. Prevent this ugly mess by learning the basics of wills and estates. I should add that this book goes well beyond the basics -- even a millionaire could learn a few good tips from this excellent book."
2,Important Detailed Information Missing,"In the book ""Cruel Hunters"" MacLean fails in several areas: first, he does not give detailed information as to how many women children and others innocent villagers were brutally exterminated during the war in Russia by the SS Commando. What really happened during that savage war, as it had been documented in numerous other books, and what really misses from that particular book are the details about the holocaust that was perpetrated with extreme organization and methodicism by the German SS. What Maclean gives are just dry details about some of the operations of the commando without conclusive analysis about the ideology and the fanatical indoctrination with which all German troops, and particularly the SS, were imbued before the invasion. More details about precisely the number of exterminated people, which furnished by other sources, reaches approximately millions."
4,"Tirelessly researched, though a bit dry in the long run","A very thorough work, meticulous in it's presentation of as much original documentation as possible. The book presents a very vivid picture of one of the most infamous anti-partisan SS units. No compromise is made in detail, though the author chooses not to provide any conjecture or analysis of the events involved. Although the events themselves were painfully poignant, the diction itself is rather dull.Despite it's flaws, I highly recommend the book as a research tool for anyone interested"
1,Great Subject........Terrible Book,I was very excited when i got this book and couldn't wait to read it. Well as i started to get deeper into the book I just couldn't believe I was reading about a great subject written so poorly. I have read 100's of WW2 books and i have to say this was by far the worst. All the author talked about was so and so got promoted or recieved the iron cross first class. Stuff the nobody really cares about. And when someone does get promoted you have to read the entire recomondation. Its truly a brutal piece of work. Basically he skims over the fights that the Cruel hunters were in and just had stats on how many people were killed or shipped back to the Reich. I have to say if you really want to read this book E mail me and you can have mine!
3,"Vague combat history , but.....","The actual combat accounts in this book are far and few between , which is a shame . I wish the writer would have spent more time tracking down eye witnesses and former members, rather than old documents which may have been 'doctored' at some point in history anyway . BUT , the detailed personnel apendix in the back of the book made it all worth it for me . Being that i positively I.D'd one of the helmets in my collection to a member of this unit! So in that respect , this book can be a bevy of information to the right people ."
2,Not My Favorite...,"This was a very slow-moving book. I picked it up on a whim at the bookstore, and now I'm regretting spending $25 on it. The idea of the story is very interesting, but the execution of it was poorly done. Luce Adams is traveling with her dead-mothers female lover Lee, to Venice and Athens. She's there to give important family documents to the Sansovinian Museum in Venice, pertaining to her ancestors travels with the great Cassanova.As she travels, she reads the diary of Asked For Adams. The ancestor that traveled with Cassaova on his journey to Constantinople in 1797. This part of the story was interesting, but still slow. And the story-line of Luce and Lee was strained.Overall, this book had great potential, but I just couldn't get into it. From beginning to end, there was no real high point. I trudged on thinking someting exciting had to happen, but nothing. Not something I recommend, save your money."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I got this phone mainly because it was free. It is completely barebones, which is fine with me since all I really want it for is talking and sending the occasional text message. HOWEVER, the battery is HORRIBLE. I thought it was just my unit, so I exchanged it, but unit #2 is equally as bad... I'm going to have to suck it up and pay for a better phone."
3,Decent,"This phone has several major drawbacks:1. You can't put your finger over the antenna and get decent service which means you have to hold the phone by your fingertips and results in me dropping it frequently.2. The default rings are pretty weak, and there is NO short text message sound--most are approx. 30 seconds in length. There is a beep sound, but everytime I set it to that, it reverts to the default when I turn it off and on.3. The speaker phone is basically unusably quite. Unless you're like in a museum you might as well use the phone normally because you have to hold it that close to hear anything anyway.4. The battery life sucks. I use my phone as an alarm and have never had a problem with a phone dying just from being in standby mode. This thing frequently dies overnight (not as a result of the searching-for-service problem.)"
1,great phone but terrible battery charge,"I just wanted a simple cell phone without all the fancy things. This Samsung phone would have been perfect. Small size, cute, sturdy, etc. But, the battery charge was unpredictable. It would stay charged for only 12-36 hrs, even though I talked on it for about 15-20 mins total. My previous Samsung phone did not have this problem. Verizon replaced the battery, but there was no improvement. Since quite a number of people have made this complaint, I wonder if there is a bad batch of Samsung U340 phones. After a month, I eventually switched over to a different brand."
2,Annoying glitch,"This phone is fine for a basic phone. I like the size and appearance of the phone. The issue is that I cannot make the settings stay set. I have been back to Verizon, and they said it was a software problem, so I left it with them for a couple of hours, while they loaded the latest software, but it still doesn't work. I emailed Samsung two days ago, but they have not responded.It's annoying to set a ringtone and have it reset to another one as soon as I receive a text message.Bad service from both Verizon and Samsung. I much preferred my LG phone."
4,good for a basic phone,"I owned this phone for a little over a year. There is nothing fancy about it. If you want a general phone to call and text on, this is a good phone. I am very rough on phones and this one held up quite well. The only reason it finally died was when I accidentaally dropped it in a bucket of water for the 3rd time.Would have bought it again but they didn't have it in the store."
2,disappointed,"While the phone doesn't have a bad look for the price they fail to inform you that it has no get it now options which means you cannot download ring tones or any applications, not even your phone book if you have it backed up on the computer. All in all my old clunker of a phone has twice as many options as this newer model."
2,beautiful and small but don't waste your money,"I have this cell for 3 month and is already broken, the charger connection is weak, even considering that the guy of the store who sold me the phone warned me about that and that I was ver very carefull .... nothing to do about it, It's a poor design"
1,Do not buy this phone.,"I've returned with it twice to the Verizon store because it doesn't hold a charge more than a day or two -- even when turned off. And I only make an average of one or two short calls a day. I own it mainly for emergency use. Both times, they replaced the battery. The second time, a surly manager at Verizon in East Cobb, Ga., only growled something about a bad batch of batteries. I will go back to the old phone it replaced before I'll give Verizon the $20 they want to replace this piece of junk before my 2-year contract is up."
1,battery is terrible,everything else is fine. but the battery is just terrible. I fully charged it and it only lasts about 24 hours.
1,DO not BUY THIS PHONE,"I have already had it replaced once, and it still does not receive calls. I will be sitting there and then I get a notification that 4 people have called me and left voicemails, but my phone never rang once, or even acknowledged that I had a call. THat means no missed call notifications and no ring. All i get is voicemails. Occasionally it will ring. My last cell phone never had this problem and i live in a decent sized city right around the corner from a verizon store. This is the worst phone i have ever experienced. DO NOT BUY IT."
3,Inconsistent,"I enjoyed most of this book, but found it inconsistent. Some parts extremely interesting - especially the portion on President Polk. For instance the White House was considered completely public, so he had difficulty working. Also, there was much insight into a little know president. Other parts were tedious, such as the older ancestors. All in all I thought it was an interesting way to portry history. The author used an extremely interesting and accomplished family to walk us through the decades and centuries."
3,Pollock's Folly,"Pollock's FollyThe material in Pollock's Folly that I have read so far is interesting from the historical point of view. I am lookinbg for clues that would hook my family ""Masten"" up to the Delaware family of Pollock. I do not think the form that the author has chosen is the easiest to read. I will try to read in bits and pieces the time frame which the author has written soon."
2,"May be a book, but not a guide","This product may contain decent content but it exhibits the most retarded way to put it in an electronic guide format. (1) no sensible cross-references; (2) maps are tucked away in obscure pages and are basically unusable because of lousy resolution; (3) the text just pours out location after location without giving you any idea where the hell this place is - you can only make sense of this ""guide"" if you shuffle between it and a google map; (4) ""navigating"" the guide itself means essentially ""flipping"" pages - which is OK with a printed book, but miserable with an electronic one; (5) you can't copy even a couple of words, for instance, to paste a name/location into a search line; (6) search returns all (!) instances of the word without discrimination - good luck trying to figure out which of them just mentions it and which actually gives more detail about the place.Summary: shoddy piece of work."
5,Quite Good but I used Lonely Planet more,"Rough Guide is quite good but I actually used Lonely Planet Australia as my primary guide (they vary from country to country as to which is better). Rough Guide has, naturally, a few things the Lonely Planet guide doesn't (I used Rough Guide as a complimentary guide).If traveling a fair amount by train ""Australia By Rail"" (Colin Taylor) is truly excellent (as are the Austrail passes).For Queensland alone the Lonely Planet Queensland guide is outstanding."
3,A reasonably useful guide for Down Under,"Wow, it's a steal at $6 - I paid about $20 originally. It covers quite a bit of ground, seems to be fairly current, and gives more focus to the touristy things to do (which makes sense). It was definitely the guide I most used while on the vacation but if it was 100 pages lighter I would have been grateful!"
3,has a little too much info for one country I like the rough guide books that cover multiple countries.,it has a little too much info for one country I like the rough guide books that cover multiple countries. also the hostel info is often wrong and the prices are never right
2,Not A Good Buy,"First, this is indeed a Kirov production so why the front cover says Bolshoi is weird. It is not filmed in front of an audience and someone thought to ""enhance"" the performance with special effects which are awful. They distract from the dance and are very irritating. The performances aren't that good overall and the whole thing is not up to Kirov standards."
1,Scandalous Junk,"This is junk. It looks like someone camcorded it off of a television, copied it 1,000 times and then transferred it to a DVD. It would be one thing if it sold for $3.00, but it doesn't. The recorded sound actually isn't bad, but the acting is so absurd you laugh."
4,"This is Kirov, not Bolshoi production","This is the Kirov film made for TV. The credits on the film correctly identify the theater as Kirov, so there is no explanation for the incorrect attribution on the DVD cover. Dancing is quite good, but the general tone of the production lacks energy."
5,Easy to Follow,Michelle explains and demonstrates very easy to follow makeup applications. I have watched other cds and this by far has been the easiest to watch. I would recommend this cd if you are looking for a professional way to apply your own makeup.
5,This pot is fantastic!!! I'd do it again,"Besides liking Cuisinart for glass top stove - has the heavier bottom that stays flat, great for glass tops - the diversity is great. I was concerned that 3 qt would be too big & heavy and that I would not like the glass lid. However, it works great & now after using it for 3 months I have no concerns about scratching the glass. Easy to clean. The built in strainer is not only great for pasta, but I've put my metal steamer (the folding kind) into this & have used it extensively to steam vegs. A definate must."
1,too thin of sides,"After lots of looking I chose this saucepan. It's deep and the right size for my family. I had just thrown out 2 saucepans purchased from a department store that lasted under a year. I got this one with high hopes, the bottom is thick as you can see, but the sides are incredibly thin. I have a gas stove, and even with the gas as low as it will go (only touching an inner diameter of 3 inches) the food that is touching the sides burns and sticks to the edges. That's with no flame even near the sides. If I was using it as a frying pan it might work, but I want to make sauce in it. I have tried stirring more frequently (which wouldn't be a great solution since I have little kids), I've tried various heat setting, and I've even sprayed cooking oil on the sides of the saucepan. It doesn't help. The sides are TOO THIN! I have a $25 pot from Target that is better than this. Don't waste your money."
5,Great pan and cover combo and price!,This chef's pan and cover combo with (2) different strainer openings is very useful for a number of cooking chores. I also think this is a real bargin for the price! I wish I had bought this years ago!
4,great pan but,I love the pan. It is just what I needed BUT I wish it had a handle or hand grip opposite the handle to make lifting it easier as it gets heavy when in use. I am older and don't have the strength in my hands and wrists that I used to have. The finish on the pan is great and makes it easy to clean. It sits well on my stove and fits my burner. It cooks evenly.
2,Not for the serious cook.,"This pan, though from a reputable company, is an under-performing pan. It takes forever to get water to boil, and the small bottom makes it useless on my large gas burner. Why I really am not happy with the pan is that i can not cook rice in it. The lid does not seal because Cuisinart decided to put a pour spout on it. This spout, in my opinion, ruins the pan. If you are serious about cooking, I do not recommend this pan."
3,Not as Good as it Should Be,"I own alot of older Cuisanairt Cookware. This pot isn't up to the old standards by a long shot. I needed an 2 quart to add to my collection, after much researching, I decided on this. It is VERY slow to heat (which means it has a negligible copper core), also the pour spout is on the wrong side of the pot. I'm right-handed, so I usually hold the pot in my LEFT hand while pouring - this make the spout on the wrong side. It's an OK pot,but only just so. I wanted stainless steel with a copper core - guess you can't find that anymore."
1,Developed stains after one use,I bought this pan and at first it came scratched and with a little bump. I asked for a replacement and received another pan. This pan had no scratches however after only one use it developed little stains in the basis that did not come off with cleaning even with a special product for stailess steel cookware. It seemed that tiny pieces of the metal coating were coming off. I was very disappointed and asked for a refund for this item.
4,"All-In-All, a worthwhile purchase",Bought this pot for boiling up small amount of pasta. It is perfectly designed for this and this is all I use it for. It's a little on the light side so I can't speak to its heat distribution properties. But as far as weight goes...it weighs enough so that when you pick it up you can tell that it's definitely NOT a piece of junk.
3,Nice but thin sidewall.,I like the pour spout and strainer lid but it is much thinner than I expected. Will easily dent and ding.
4,Good pot for cooking stuff.,"Good pot overall, would recommend people buy it.PROS/Like:-Good pot, heats stuff at a decent pace.CONS/Dislike:-Easily scratched when using a metal fork to stir pasta.Other thoughts:Scratches are not deep, but are just not aesthetically pleasing.Wish Cuisinart would label the manufacturing country on these pots."
2,Not the Usual Cuisinart Quality,"My other two Cuisinart saucepans have much heavier bottoms. This one is much thinner, and the bottom doesn't distribute heat nearly as well. It's OK for boiling pasta or potatoes, but rice sticks to the bottom. I wouldn't have bought this pan if I'd seen it in person. I should have returned it, but now it's been used."
2,Very poor handle design. Awkward to use.,Poor balance and skinny handle make it hard to pick up and extremely awkward to pour from. It's so difficult to control when lifting or pouring hot liquids that I actually thought it was dangerous. I returned it.
5,My Go To Saucepan,"I purchased the 2 quart saucepan with cover and I absolutely love it! The cover is key for draining pasta and the 2 Quart size is perfect for 1-2 person. I also use this saucepan to boil water for tea/ coffee, making soups, and even risotto.I have had this saucepan for over 6 months now and it still looks like it's brand new despite using it nearly every day."
5,>>> GROWING UP,"Haing not seen the DVD yet, i went to see this show in Philly and I know that this is one that you would not want to miss being a Peter Gabriel fan or not. With stuning visuals and great songs to boot this is a show that is good for any music collection. From the zorb ball, to the bike, to the upsidedown walk, to the light show it was one of the best shows of 2002-2003. I highly suggest this DVD for people who missed the show and who want to relive it. I here the extra features contain and making of featurette and many more. If the 5.1 mix is anything like the Secret World Live DVD its going to be worth it in everyway."
5,Preview,"I went to his concert in June 2003(outdoor version) and it was fantastic. Let's face it you don't just go to a Peter Gabriel concert--you experience it and ""what a show"". If it is anything like the ""Secret World"" DVD, it will be great. I am looking forward to the experience with the new DVD. If anyone would like a preview, go to ""www.petergabriel.com"" and click on the ""news"" feature on the bottom bar."
5,blown away...,"Peter's US tour back in '92 was the first concert I ever attended, and it remains one of the best live shows I've ever seen. I did not get a chance to see Growing Up Live in person, but this DVD is phenomenal in every sense of the word. Amazing sound/picture, great song selection, incredible band. What else can I say? If you love live music and mind-blowing visuals, this is for you."
5,"IT'S THE SOUND, MAN!","Peter Gabriel has always embraced technology as it has emerged. This disc has a fantastic DTS presentation. If you like Peter Gabriel, and have a system that you can turn up, you will especially enjoy Sledgehammer. Sounds great, looks great!"
5,Best live music DVD in my collection,"In short, this live DVD is tremedous. The concert itself is phenomenal and the production quality of the dvd match this quality. I highly recommned it.I'd also plug the Soundstage Tom Petty DVD for incredible quality."
3,growing up,"No too bad ,only thing dissapointed with was the amount of time showing under the stage. Got annoying after awhile.Over all just a bit dissapointing."
5,"Brilliant sound, visuals didn't do much for me","I'm a big PG fan and have been since the second album, and I was eager to see this disc. I'm not a big fan of concert videos usually, and I probably wouldn't watch this more than once. However, the sound is excellent - the best thing I've heard on my DTS system and I've played the disc with the TV off and the audio only - it's fantastic!"
5,PERHAPS THE BEST CONCERT FILM EVER,"Ignore the review from my state's northern area, this is a brilliant concert! Yes, the crew are visible... so what? They are an extremely important part of this show; besides, this isn't the first time the crew has been integrated into a concert (remember the Jawa-like techies on the ""Rust Never Sleeps"" tour?)The picture quality is excellent; the sound is fabulous. I only wish there was more behind-the-scenes stuff, like interviews with band members, etc. Obviously, fans are going to want this. Most will love it."
5,Simply unbelievable,"Being an avid PG fan for years, I was eagerly awaiting a DVD release of his new tour. Having seen him live in 2002 in NYC, I was amazed how lifelike the concert seems, and the sound quality (especially in DTS) is simply impeccable.Personally, I would've preferred more extra material on the DVD, but mixing Tony Levin's photos with a GREAT remix of ""More than this"" simply makes it worthwhile.Once again, a great release from a great artist."
2,Beatiful audio...but the video is *&%$#@,"I didn't like of video quality. The audio quality is ""ok"".A believe that production manager didn't has good resourcesto film this video. There wasn't hight technology how there is in Rush(Rush in Rio), Pink Floyd, U2 and Rolling Stones.Is true: Growing Up Live was filmed with 10 cameras. See techanical caracteristics in oficial site.2 stars"
1,Great Tour,"The Growing Up Tour was a fantastic presentation by Peter Gabriel. With that said, today is Oct. 13th, the DVD isn't released until Nov. 4th, and already Amazon is allowing folks to review it. What a farce. Who can anyone honestly review something that doesn't exist yet? I saw the show live, loved it, but that says NOTHING about the quality of the DVD. 1 star for stupidity."
1,Incorrect Region Code,"I'm disappointed as this DVD is of Region Code 1, whereas my player (as logical in Finland!) can play only Region Code 2 DVDs. Region Codes are not mentioned at your web-site and when making the order/purchase.Your return policy is also unclear. I see it unfair that I should pay for a postal charge, or any other compensation, when you send a product that I can not use with my DVD player."
1,Absolutely Horrendous,"I have never been disappointed by a Peter Gabriel performance...until now. I am really glad I didn't spend the $150 for tickets to see his show in NYC. What was up with the monks who sat under the stage and changed the stage sets inbetween songs? They also followed him around with a camera. Very creepy. Peter looked like he went to a Star Wars garage sale and layered on his purchases.His entrance was very undramatic and not like him at all. It worked alright just not what I expected. His voice was stressed and he looked very uninterested in being there. The studio overdubbing of the vocals was too much. So much that it sounded bad after overmixing.His background singer is NO Paula Cole and whatever New Jersey diner he found her at, she needs to be returned.The whole performance was painfully performed, painfully shot and only need be bought to complete your collection."
2,Big disappointment,"Having seen two of the performances from this video on Youtube, I was very disappointed in the entire performance. I have seen other performances by Peter Gabriel and he is always a dynamic performer. Most of the songs on this are very melancholy and slow, the performances are subdued. I knew when I was watching this that it would go on the shelf until the next yard sale or donation run. Do not waste your time or money on this."
5,Fantastic,"I often thought that when he left Genesis, they would be better off anyway. Not true. I could only wonder what Genesis would have been if they had stayed together. Who would have guessed that Genesis would fade away and Gabriel's genius would prove itself. Secret World Live is fantastic if you haven't seen it. This is not disappointing. Sky Blue arrangement is one of his best. My suggestion; get a projector and enjoy."
5,Straight Foward,"Dag Nasty is one of the many D.C. punk bands to thrive in the early 80's. But what makes them stand out among the rest is the explosive power of the guitar riffs with the bass and drums not far behind. And the combination of the two albums shows not only that bands can survive with different members, but also how they can grow and stay true to them selves."
3,Helpful for finding food and lodging but I question the ratings,The book was helpful for finding food and lodging but I disagree on some of the ratings. Some motels listed as excellent were worse than some rated as good. The food ratings and recommendations I found to be more reliable. We stopped at many of the recommended food places and were not disappointed. The addresses listed in the book were helpful for navigating route 66 and determining what towns would be good for stopping.
3,Not quite what I thought,"I'm getting ready to take my first full trip down Route 66. I bought this guide to direct me to authentic 66 dining and lodging. I was disappointed to find that a lot of the places listed are chains and places that didnt exist on the original 66. However, it does mention if an establishment is a supporter of Route 66. In general, it is a good guide, if you don't care about the authenticity of the place."
4,Route 66 Dining & Lodging Guide - 12th edition,Well written with lots of places to eat and stay. I would recommend this to everyone.
4,Basic Book,"This book pretty much provides what it advertises. I was a little disappointed in the description of most of the places. It is very difficult to tell what is a true can't miss place to stay and eat, or just a run of the mill restaurant or motel.I will give it credit for the abundance of places listed through out all the states, look forward to making use of it on my Route 66 Journey."
4,Holiday Planning,I propose to drive The Mother Road this year and this booklet is part of the planning scheme. Its very helpful when planning the driving stages between meals and overnight stays
1,Actually 0 stars,"Don't waste your money. This book was useless. I just returned from my trip on Route 66 and never once found this book useful. I suggest Route 66 Adventure Handbook, by Knowles and highly recommend Traveling Route 66, by Freeth. The last a great traveling companion helps figure out mileage and what to see."
4,Compact and useful,Great resource for finding places to eat and sleep while following Route 66--or for anybody traveling through the areas covered by this guide. An invaluable supplement to road maps and/or turn-by-turn guides to 66.
3,Two Warner Bros. Melodramas for the Price of One!,"An overrated potboiler, ""They Drive by Night"" (1940) turns a gritty look at truckers into a noir melodrama lifted from 1935's ""Bordertown."" Raoul Walsh's vigorous direction and a solid cast redeem the schizophrenic storyline. George Raft has good chemistry with Humphrey Bogart and Ann Sheridan - while Ida Lupino makes a compelling femme fatale. The Warner Bros. stock company provides memorable support. Walsh, Bogart and Lupino would fare better in ""High Sierra"" (1941)."
4,a very entertaining movie,"The only thing i was a little dissapointed with was that there are two charming stories in this movie yet they have the misfortune of being thrown together so we don't get to fully examine either one...The movie starts out as a very campy expose about the hardships of being a trucker working in difficult economic times.. The dialogue and characters are priceless... somewhere along the way the plot takes a twist.. the two brothers are no longer in focus.. and we get a ruthless yet satisfying melodrama of a woman so desperate to entrap the george raft character that she goes to any lengths removing all obstacles...Despite the uncomfortable switch in plot, 'they drive by night' remains a great example of raoul walsh's direction and of film noir in general.. The characters in the movie were enough to keep me interested and highly satisfied..."
4,A diverging story brought together under crime...,"The Fabrini brothers, Joe (George Raft) and Paul (Humphrey Bogart), are truck drivers that struggle to make it on their own as a loan shark is on their heels trying to repossess their truck . It all seems futile as Joe and Paul's competition is full of bigger companies that do not care about the smaller companies as it is a dog eat dog world. This forces the Fabrini brothers to work long hours often without adequate sleep. One night after a rough day Joe and Paul pick up a hitchhiker, Cassie Hartley (Ann Sheridan), and together the three of them witness a truck accident where some friends die as they fell asleep behind the wheel. This is a wake up call for the brothers as they have different priorities in their lives, and it brings them in different directions. They Drive By Night is an interesting film with multiple themes, which offers a good cinematic experience"
1,Yawn....,"This movie is terrible. It's obvious why a young Bogie surpassed Raft like he was standing still after this movie. Raft was an awful actor. The only decent role he had was ""Each dawn I die"", and that's because Cagney carried him. To compare him with Cagney or Bogie is like comparing Tiny Tim to Elvis !!!!"
5,bogart/raft,"bogart / raft type move frome 30,s ,rare to see them act together.story of that errer. very good"
4,GOOD CHUTE,THIS WAS MUCH LOWER THAN WHAT SEARS HAD THEIRS PRICED AT. SAME ITEM EVEN THE BOX HAS SEARS ON IT SO THIS ORDER WAS LESS & THATS WHAT WE ALL LIKE TO SAVE MONEY.
1,I should have known better ......,another one of those books with Anonymous as the author ....I do not know why erotic literature written about California women manage to paint such disgusting and unlikeable characters that rather than erotic they are downright aggravating ....The book starts out with a one night stand where we meet Linda Kittridge as a man hating female witch ... yeah right feel free to change the first letter of the last word if you like ... The reader expect this to be a show .. but well into the book we find that Linda is truly a man hating witch ..... By the time that she supposedly discovers her sexuality and softens .... thereader hates her so much that neiter she nor the book have any redeeming value ....Sorry but forget it .... forget it .....
4,Decent concert footage,"Mixed feelings on this one, ""One step beyond"" is almost worth it by itself. The crowd goes nuts (pun intended), but then its a bit downhill from there. The extra's are kind of weak, but decent enough for fans of the music."
4,a good movie...,"This is basically a movie about the adult single scene in the mid to late 80's. It's based in Chicago and is about a couple that gets together after a ""one night stand"" struggling with love and life. Throw in their friends that are not trying to help in the least (his is the typical @#$hole and her's the typical b@#$%). All four actors play their parts well and this remains one of my favorite movies from the 80's.I've watched this movie several times and even bought the soundtrack. I recommend it for a good watch. This is back when Demi Moore was absolutely beautiful in my opinion"
5,A real love movie,"I saw this movie more as 30 Times in the last 10 Years. And every time the same will happen. I cant'stop laughing or crying. The Actors and the Dialogs are so impressive ( In the German Version) About last Night is not a regular Love Story, but it could be a real Love."
