5,Very easy gummi rail cover,This is a great product! I have a sleigh-style crib so it works great for us. We only had to cover 2 sides of the crib rails and had a little left over. VERY easy to install and doesn't come off.
5,Saved Madelyn's beautiful crib!!,Great product/protector of Madelyn's beautiful crib. She was just into her teething and making marks on her oversize crib rails. This saved the day! Was concerned over reviews which gave a negative for sticking power of this guard. We had NO problem applying and it has certainly withstood Madelyn's constant chewing.
4,"Adhesive not perfect, but I have another suggestion","So, the adhesive started peeling up for us after a few hours, and we tried the hairdryer reapplication. I don't know how that would have worked because we instead came up with the following solution:This will only work if you have standard, not overly thick rails. We had the 4-piece Prince Lionheart crib rails before, but they were a joke because she could rip them right off. But then we discovered that we could put the Prince Lionheart ones OVER the Gummi Crib Rail, and they're wedged on tightly now. Now the adhesive problem of the Gummi Crib Rail is solved because the Prince Lionhearts are holding it down, and the too-easy-to-pull-off problem of the Prince Lionhearts are solved because the Gummi Crib Rail wedges them on.Anyway, this will only work for you if the Prince Lionhearts fit your crib rail in the first place but are fairly easy to pull off. Great solution if it works on your crib though!"
2,"Eh, good idea, poor execution.","We purchased one of these back in October. It went on smoothly, and stayed on.. for two months. Then it came up at both ends (I'm sure my 15 month old assisted with this process!) and using a blow dryer, like the directions suggested, did not help. After looking around for something else, we went ahead and just bought another one of these about a month ago. It never stayed on, despite the fact that I had cleaned the crib rail pretty thoroughly before applying it. For a couple of weeks, I could get the Gummi rail to stick with the aid of the blow dryer. Now, however, nothing will work. What a waste of money, especially this second time! I am going to try the hard plastic rails next.."
1,Doesn't stick.,"The adhesive just wouldn't stay down on the side rails. Don't know if mine was defective or what, but wouldn't recommend."
1,Did not hold up well.,This product was more of a hassle then anything else. It was a pain to put on and my 10 month old at the time destroyed it. He would just tear it off and then the finish would go with it. I would stick with a cloth cover that has teething hook attachments.
3,not enought,"Product works ok. Stayed on so far but, not enought to do crib. Not even enought to do the 2 side rails."
2,No match for a determined baby,"Purchased this Gummi Crib Rail based on majority of positive reviews. Followed instructions by cleaning crib rail with rubbing alcohol prior to applying product and let it sit overnight with vice grips to ensure proper application. At first the protector did its job and our baby was happy to have something to chew on. The problem developed as our little one learned he could ""pick at"" the protector with his bottom teeth. Slowly but surely, he's managed to peel up the crib rail and the product has been rendered useless at this point. Surprised this hasn't happened with more people. Money down the drain. I wouldn't recommend this product unless you think your baby won't be so determined."
1,"Terrible product, save your money - Does not stick to crib","Purchased this recently to install on my 8 month old daughter's crib. Followed the instructions perfectly and allowed more than ample time to 'set'(about 24 hours without a baby touching it.)I walked into my daughter's room the next morning after install and she had peeled 75% of the gummy crib rail teether off already. Attempts to re-stick it have failed. It's only purpose is entertainment for my daughter as it keeps her occupied trying to pull it off. This hunk of rubber is not worth your money, look elsewhere. Don't take my word for it, just read the other reviews (I should have)*Updated to say that I decided to throw this in the trashcan. When I tried to peel off the only remaining section where the gummy crib rail cover ACTUALLY stuck, it ripped the paint off my daughter's crib."
4,So far so good,"Our son started chewing on his crib recently, so we immediately bought rail guards. So far, the rail guard is staying on the rail. We cleaned the rail first, and cleaned again wiping it with rubbing alcohol. There were no issues getting it on, or getting it to stick. The look of the product is nice. It's clear and blends right in with the crib. We like it better than the fabric covers because it looks unobtrusive and does not move when our son grabs the rail for standing support. The only drawback is that it is about 3 inches too short to cover the whole rail. Since crib sizes are pretty standard, I'm amazed that it couldn't be lengthened to fit better."
4,Just what we needed,Just in time and what we needed. Our baby started to chew the crib a day before we recieved the cover. And it worked perfectly. It could be more esthetic or with colors though.
1,"Ruins crib finish, defeating the purpose of having it","I installed this protector in hopes of saving the expresso crib finish from our teething little angel. Because of the crib design, we were unable to use one of the cloth covers that strap on over the rail, so this was a nice alternative. Installation took a little time but a hair dryer helped to get those loose corners to stay stuck down. The protector held up nicely over time but approximately 8 months later, when our little girl was over her chewing phase, I started to remove the protector and it was stuck on really good. I worked it off slowly across the crib but as I moved along the protector adhesive also began removing the crib finish with it. Now I have a damaged crib rail and it looks probably no worse than if I had installed nothing and let our girl just chew on the crib. Im very unhappy, please do yourself a favor and do NOT buy this item. Zero Stars!"
1,Couldn't attach it to the crib,The material was made well but their suggestion for attaching it to the crib was useless. It fell off right away. Waste of money.
1,total garbage,Great in theory but the product itself is garbage. The adhesive lasted maybe a week then peeled off on half of it.
3,Great but needs adjusting,The product overall is good. We have a crib that is arched so you have to cut to properly fit to the crib rail.
2,Adhesive doesn't work,"It worked well for only a couple of weeks, but the adhesive came loose soon after. The manufacturer's suggestion of re-sticking it with a hair dryer simply doesn't work. Looking for a better product."
2,"Prevents little teeth from chewing crib, but sticky feel to it.","This crib rail guard did stop by toddler from chewing on the wood rails of her crib. It stuck on well enough, and fit well over the wood of the front of the crib too, but the plastic has a sticky feel to it (even the upright side that isn't supposed to stick to anything). I noticed when putting the baby in the crib, her blanket or clothes would sometimes stick to it. I ended up buying the cloth crib rail guards which look better and can be put in the washing machine. I'd recommend the cloth tie-on rail guards over this one."
3,"Nice idea, but very easy to remove from crib by child","""dedeee33w22w3232"" that is what my son wrote when I asked him about this product. What this means is that he had lots of fun removing this guard from the crib. The guard lasted about 2 weeks, before he completely ripped it off."
2,Dissapoiting....,"Iwas dissapointed watching this DVD. I think the idea of just a basic rock band, with guitar, bass and drums was a good idea, but Gary's mates who are playing bass and drums simply don't care! They are playing like if they were not interested with the show, showing no guts, no energy, no vibe. Maybe they're reflecting the audience's lack of interest. I was shocked by this. They are playing alongside one of the most underrated guitarrists of all time, and apparently don't give a dim about that...Also, Gary's performance is very uneven, maybe because his carrer was always a little bit unfocused and irregular, so the set lilst is a shamble.Gary's physical apperance is also disturbing, but this is not the important thing. He is playing his white guitar apparently in unusual manner, like he, also, don't care about the gig. Very weird."
2,Long Time Fan Dislikes This One,"Where to start, Well the playing is excellent but the vocals are horrible. Other than the new songs from his then current disc he forces all of the vocals on this. I was glad to see the older tunes on this release but could of done with out the harsh vocals. I was also not very happy with the length on this DVD. Oh well I'm waiting for the Gary Moore:Live at Montreux 1990 DVD I know that one will be better. Being a fan for over 25 years I can't say to the casual listener to buy this this is for hardcore fans only."
1,Disappointed,"Being a Gary Moore fan since the late 70's, I was really excited about this release. His playing is sloppy, singing ( or I should say shouting )and bends are out of key, and his rhythm tone sounds like proccessed, Nu-Metal. This dvd is pure rubbish. I don't know what he's been doing recently, but it certainly hasn't been keeping his chops up. I would suggest finding a used copy of the out of print, 1984 Emerald Isles or Live in Stockholm from 1987. This is terrible and it saddens me to write this review on one of my all time favorite guitarist. Don't waste your money. This is terrible.I'm editing this because I just got Live at Montreaux 1990 for Christmas yesterday.It's smoking. Buy that dvd instead of this one"
5,I don't understand how Anyone can criticize this dvd...,"Gary Moore has always been one of my favorite guitarists, composers, songwriterssince Day One...He's a master of his Art, no matter the style. The one reviewerwas disappointed by his vocals...Who cares? He's got his own raspy style whichcompliments his own work..This dvd is One Very Kick Ass Experience..Ive had itfor two years, and have yet to have grown tired of it..I cannot agree morewith the others who gave this 5 stars..Rather its Rock, Blues, or FusionGary Moore is a World Class Gutarist (Bar None)...Buy and Enjoy thisconcert..It will Knock Your Socks Off...!!"
3,"Moore is Less, but blame the Venue","I have most of Gary Moores Concert dvd's and this was a very tuff crowd he had to play in front of Mullets and all.The 3 piece band was a little thin sounding and as ussual as the warm up act he got half the lights and half the sound.His amplifier tone was different in this concert it was very hollow not the normal big blistering Marshall tone he is known for.And i can't completely blame his voice in this dvd the sound man did not give him any effects or reverb or delay.The choice of songs was good and i liked his opening song ""Shape of things to come"" which you also see him play and sing in the bonus material at the sound check when the venue is empty.Good but not his best....Try live at Montreaux"
5,A well-researched and entertaining social history.,"This well-researched and informative book about the grand resort hotels of the White Mountains is simply one of those books which you add with pride to your library collection. It shows the hotel's importance in the architectural and social historical realm of New England and American history. It is full of andedotes on the hotel industry and is a vastly entertaining social picture. The book is full of many illustrations of present and long-gone hotels, 200 b&w and a number of color plates. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the hospitality history of this country, and the importance in the realm of things that the hotel places. Dr. Tolles have expertly brought this subject to life and I commend him for it."
3,Needs conclusions,I found this story not written for historians or people interested in history but written for architects. It's just not a compelling story. I find it lacking in the human aspect and really doesn't tell a story which makes for informative sharing. Basically it's too dry and doesn't really make me feel compelled to learn more.
4,A good single with lots of extra remixes!,"This little single has a lot of suprises and good techno beats. Faith No More has to be one of the best bands in the world. Blending Rap, metal, funk, and techno this album couldn't be better. Take it from me, the worlds biggest Faith No More fan!"
3,Good but could be better.,"Pros:Excellent accuracy. On-screen maps. Waterproof and floats. Rugged. Big buttons. SD cards (add a card reader and save hours).Cons:Big & heavy. Buttons too easy to press accidentally. Serial connection (serial?! why not USB?). Screen hard to read in shadows. Messy menu navigation.On a like-for-like comparison to other mapping handheld GPS this gets 5-stars. On the basis of what it could have been had Magellan really thought it through, it gets 2-stars.I'd say this (and others like it) are the last of the 2nd generation GPS. Good for their time, but rapidly being obsoleted by developments in other areas. Expect to see a switch to a variety of GPS/PDA/phone/bluetooth/radio combos with much better integration into the wireless PC world coming in the next product cycle."
3,Average GPS,"This was my first GPS. I ended up returning it. Here is my experience:Cons:(1) Difficult to use for driving even though it received signals very well. When I bought it I thought it was voice prompted. Actuall it was audio prompted, meaning that it beeps when it thinks you should make a turn.(2) Rerouting is not automatic. You have to press a button. That's not convenient.(3) screen is small and black and white. Looks primitive. For $450, I thought it should be better than that.Pros:(1) Does have detailed street level info when you load the CD."
5,"Excellent, excellent, excellent","I could not put this book down. I pretty much read it straight through, stopping only to make dinner and throw another load of clothes into the washing machine. I would have liked to read more (maybe even a sequel?) about these thoroughly enjoyable, interesting, lovable characters. I loved this book and plan to read more, if not all, of Luanne Rice's books."
2,Disappointing!,"I first read Luanne Rice's ""Home Fires"" and loved it so much I went looking for more, then read ""Follow the Stars Home"" which was also wonderful, and I started collecting her books. This is the 3rd one I have read by her and was sooo disappointed that it did not compare with the other 2 mentioned here. It is a lot of boring dialogue in the beginning, seeming to lead to nowhere in the first 100+ pages and you want to scream ""get going here with something"" - I am not giving up on her however, as her later books were better and this was only her 2nd book. Maybe she was experimenting or something. I am reading Summer Light next and keeping my fingers crossed!"
3,Not her best,"This was my 6th Rice book and I grabbed it from the Library with bated breath. Alas, I am so dissapointed. It is hard to say why this one fell flat, but the earlier reviews shed some light on this book. Only 4, 3 who liked it and 1 who had read others and was disappointed with it as am I. I did not like the sex scenes and I am not a prude. It was just not as even as Rice can be. and it is very hard to review this book."
2,A must for any Luanne Rice fan but,"But other then that go for another one of Luanne Rice's books. I enjoyed this one enough, but it was not a favorite of mine. I felt that she jumped around between the charactors quite frequently, never spending enough time with her strongest lead charactor Cass. Sometimes I also felt that the parts where she cut off to what little Josie was thinking were rather odd, and disjointed containing little pertantent information to the story line. Pick up her newest book Dance with Me instead of this one. I guarentee you won't be disappointed."
2,Blue Moon,Not her best. Too much information that doesn't interest me. I'm only reading it still to find out how it ends for the hard of hearing girl.Eleanor
3,It's Different,"I liked this book although the writing was a lot different than her other books, but it did have a good story about an extended family and the ties that bind families together and family relationships. I hope that a 1st time Luanne Rice reader doesn't base their opinion of her writing on this book alone, since it is quite different than her usual style. Give her another chance with some of her newer works like Dance With Me or Beach Girls."
5,Luanne Rice,"I love Luanne Rice as an author. I used to read Danielle Steel, but Luanne has now got me converted. I've read almost all of her books, and can't put them down once I get started."
1,Gross,"I normally love Luanne Rice but this book was disgusting. I hated the way it started and the treatment of the deaf child made me ill. I hoped it would get better but I was unable to get past the disgusting ""sex"" scene in the parking lot. No author needs that much explicit sex to sell a book, but since the book was so bad I guess she had to do something to sell it. I will be very leary of her books in the future."
3,All I want for Christmas,"The movie arrived good and in an a timely fashion, except the movie itself is very dark. Much darker than when it played on TV."
1,Not the same movie,This is not the same movie described in the Editorial Review. The actors are totally different from the ones mentioned there.
5,Wonderful movies,"The Christmas Card, was a wonderful move of love of how a simple letter can effect someone's life.All I Want for Christmas, was great too, it showed the sacrifices a mother would go through for her child and about how you can miss love that if right in front of you."
5,Christmas movies,I enjoy Christmas movies all year long and have an extensive collection. These two additions are enjoyable viewing and help put you in the mood for Christmas (if you need any help).
4,a cute christmas movie,True this is not the movie described above. But it is a cute christmas movie that was on the Hallmark channel last year.Its about a boy who hears about a contest that would grant 1 child's christmas wish. So he asks for a husband for his mom and wins. Making it a very interesting holiday season.
5,DVD review,"I ordered Christmas movies, got a great deal and it arrived quickly. Can't get any better - good deal, quality merchandise, quick arrival. Thank you very much!!"
5,Christmas card is my favorite,I enjoy this movie every year . And I will enjoy watching them when I want to with out waiting for them on tv.
3,mixed feelings,"The Christmas Card had me teary eyed regarding our soldiers serving during the holidays.There is a warmth and loyalty in this family and town.A lesson in getting to know someone before getting too involved is revealed.All I want for Christmas is the reason I didn't give a higher star.This movie is not so much about Christmas as an inappropriate romance.Although, it has a good ending there is too much to watch before that happens."
1,Heroine Selfish/Movie Horrible,"Do not want to write a long review, but definitely avoid this one! Heroine is selfish and does not really sit down and talk to her son to see what his feelings or wants are. She accepts the rich guy's proposal knowing she doesn't love him, but reasons that he will provide what her son with family. What she didn't say, but was evident, was that he would provide her son with wealth. She calls off the engagement when he decides to send her beloved son to boarding school. When the heroine kissed the hero, she made the most disgusting face, as if she couldn't stomach him. Finally, she accepts the hero's proposal right after she breaks it off with the rich guy. I felt sorry for the hero that he was only a consolation prize. She probably accepted his proposal because the engagement ring looked to be at least 1-2 carats! Avoid this one at all costs!"
2,"Same old, same old","If you were not able to predict the ending within the first 10 minutes of this generic offering then you haven't watched the zillion other Christmas movies of this genre. The good guys are over the top good (plucky but troubled widow, next door neighbor conveniently serving as father figure), the bad guys are dastardly bad (evil toy company out to roll over the competition) and the fatherles kid is (supposedly) cute as a button. If you have a child that believes in fairies and Santa and you are looking for something to pass a couple of hours, it might be OK if they don't get totally bored by the sentimental pap."
4,A very good movie.,I would have given it a 5 star but there was a lengthy problem of downloading it. The movie was great.
4,Christmas Movies,I've seen both these movies previously during the holidays. Each year I look forward to seeing them again. I finally decided to purchase them because I liked them so much. Now I can watch them anytime I want. I would recommend them to anyone who likes a good love story.
5,Great Christmas movies,Loved the Christmas Card especially. I watch it every year. Highly recommended to those who like happily ever after endings.
5,A heart warming program.,This boy really likes his neighbor who has lived next door to him since he was a little child. When the mother starts dating fellows as a campaign promotion for a company the boy becomes worried that she will pick the one fellow she kind of likes. In the end however she discovers that the fellow has plans to send the boy to a school somewhere and that he has different values than her so she breaks up with him. The neighbor is always there to pick up the pieces at the end of a bad day or situation and make it all work out. Excellent program!!
2,"Not the best, but not the worst","This was a cheesy version of the Sleepless in Seattle theme. Son enters a contest to get his mom a new husband. The woman doesn't seem like an idiot at first. Unfortunately, she turns out to be just that. She turns down several guys because they are obviously not right for her and her son, but the one she finally chooses is the worst of all. It was a very forced story line. The writers could have made her decision make sense, but they chose not to do that. So, she was just left looking like an idiot. The son was cute, and I enjoyed the relationship between him and the next door neighbor. But the mom and the neighbor just didn't have enough chemistry. It was pretty cheesy in the end. Having said all that, I liked the first half of the movie. It was just the last half that left me wanting more."
3,"Lighthearted, but a little disappointing","I enjoyed this Christmas story but was disappointed at the unnecessary and contrived storyline of the toy company competition. The acting was ok and the friendship to romance premise between the main characters was nicely developed and the Cinderella-like makeover was enjoyable to watch. The whole ""find my mum a husband"" competition winner, and subsequent media coverage of this seemed unnecessary and a little unbelievable. The toy company executives were also a little one dimensional. This part of the story seemed contrived to me. The simple love story, with a little more character development, would have been enough to make this film more memorable."
5,Saving your life,"The Christmas card is a very touching emotional, heart felt movie, that you will love and can relate too. All I want for christmas is great, but says we are looking for our perfect partner, and our gift to love is around us always. Both very good"
5,old time gaming,i owned it once but could not find it to save my life. im just grateful someone is still selling it
3,STRAIGHT TO THE FACT REVIEW ON THE P15-S409,"I have had this laptop for over 6 months now. Here's my review:PROs:- Good lookin!- Nice wide screen- P4/ 2.8 GHZ/ 60GB HDD is great- Love the DVD/CD burnerCONs:- It comes with XP Home. It SHOULD have XP Pro. I had to upgrade mine, but you have to take care to upgrade it before you install SP1. This was a big issue for me.- Battery life is about an hour. With P4 and all the applications, this is expected I guess.- No INFRARED port!! I was disgusted when I found this out recently.- Toshiba Support is NOT good. They do not even have a decent user forum on their site!!!EVERYTHING else is fine. I love this laptop, despite its 3 shortcomings above."
1,Power Plug Issues,"WARNING:Please note the following,Toshiba laptops have a design flaw with their DC power plug on the motherboard. The back pin of the power plug tends to get a hairline fracture that forces consumers to ""wiggle"" the power cord on the back of the laptop.In most cases, all power connectivity is lost, and the laptop will have to be sent in for repairs.This usually occurs after 1 - 2 years of ownership of the device. You will most likely be out of warranty when it occurs; however, if you are still in warranty, there are toshiba service centers available.Out of warranty repair costs: $300.00+"
2,TOSHIBA SERVCE & SUPPORT SUCKS.,I bought this laptop and using for 2 years. The major problem 1 is Fans installed at bottom of the laptop which makes system power off when u place on bed or any cushion surface. The overheating problem was never fixed even though after I sent to Toshiba repair.Major problem 2 is laptop screen messes up most of the times and screen will be with colors and lines dancing which was never fixed even though after I sent to Toshiba repair.TOSHIBA SERVICE AND SUPPORT STINKSSo if you buy this and if you have any problems take the laptop personally to the local service center and get it fixed.The other problem that I have is this fan makes a very loud noice all of a sudden and then its back to normal...I think it is so annoying.IT IS BETTER NOT TO BUY ANY TOSHIBA PRODUCTS.
2,Toshiba support stinks,"Just bought the P15-S409. So far so good. Until I called support in Istanbul Turkey. Polite but only capable of telling me official Toshiba policies and not caring about actually solving the problem. To quote them: ""Toshiba does not support upgrades from XP Home to Pro"". Well gee, I guess I'll throw this computer away and buy a new one. Nothing like having a product represented by a third party that doesn't give a."
4,Great product,"This mini water cooler is a life saver for the workplace. The shared water cooler is really far from my desk, so it's very convenient to have this right on the desktop within reach. Haven't had a problem with it yet and I've been using it for almost 8 months now. It's very quiet and cute. Office mates have commented positively on it since I brought it in."
1,Deceptive Looks - zero rating,"This unit is for 3 LITER service only.A 3 GALLON bottle WILL NOT FIT because the top well is tooshallow. I know because I bought one of these by mistake.It looks way bigger than it really is in the pictures.The Avanti WD200 Mini is really mini, only 11 inches highwithout bottle.For standard 3 & 5 gallon counter top service theAvanti WD29EC or the Haier WDQT165W is the way to go."
1,Frequent Reviewer,"I got the product quickly - but it's an awful product. It's a very low quality s-video cable, and since it's so long and lacks high-quality wire insulation, the video signal gets very distorted, blurry, and washed out. Do not buy this cable. Although it may cost more for a quality 50ft s-video cable, it's worth it. Buying this one was a waste of time and money."
2,Ehhh....,"Don't think you are getting a smokin' deal on s cables, they are worth the price. Very thin jacket and after awhile the molded plugs pull away from the jacket exposing the insulated conductors. Cables are usually worth the money you spend on them, except Monster. A 50 ft s-video cable should cost at least $15, below that, bleccchhhhh!Don't rate Parts Express on the quality of this one cable. They are a fantastic supplier of just about everything electronic. This product is an anomoly."
5,S-Video cable,"This is a standard 50 ft. cable it worked fine and came in on time, no problem after a year of use."
4,Cable,Bought for my projection TV and it has a good clear picture. Was very easy to connect. Good price for this item.
5,good item,"very good quality cables, very soft sleave, so far no issues with them, they work good, picture quality is nice"
1,Not a good option !,"I purchased this item to run my laptop signal onto my big screen tv.I don't know if its the cabel quality that is the issue or the length ofthe cable iteslf but the signal projects just fine, but there are scrolling horizontal lines on the tv that go up and down the screen and never stop.I tried a different s video cable and the lines went away. so the problem is with the cable and not my equipment.I would avoid this s video cable if I were you...."
1,Garbage. Suitable as a clothesline.,"Replacing my 30' Belkin S-Video cable, to get the proper position for my projector.WOW! I normally expect to have a video picture transmitted through an S-Video cable. This piece of crap couldn't even approximate the background color, though to be honest, it was hard to tell the background at all among the squiggles and distortions that rolled mercilessly across what could optimistically be described as ""the picture"".The cable I received was about half as thick as a pencil. The photo makes it look like a nice thick cable. This is a lie, its the thinnest s-video cable I've ever seen.Save your cash, get a little nicer cable, this one sucks."
5,quality razor - quality price,"I have used many razors, typically just falling into the marketing hype surrounding them, and the razor i keep on going back to is the sensor3. It not only lasts longer than the more expensive mach3 turbo but provides an equivolent shave to the mach3(regular). It costs less than both and when used with the right shaving gel(i prefer neutrogena razor defense gel) provides and extrodinary shave with little irritation. All in all, it's a great buy."
2,not what you think,"I heard shabazz's appearience on gravediggaz album 6 feet deep (diary of a madman) its an awsome song. I went and bought this ablum (hidden scrollz) to find only 2 good songs on it. I thought shabazz would of kept his sick style he projected in diary of a madman, Dont expect the simular style on this cd, except Crime saga. 3/10"
3,shabazz,"shabazz tearz up on Crime saga like the other rating said, best song ever made, couple of other good tracks, expected more horrorcore style on cd kinda disapointed"
5,Masterpiece,Shabazz the disciple hidden scrol is a f*ckin tight album. Whoever didn't like it doesn't love hip-hop at all. Shabazz keep dropping knowledge songs after song with a nice flow and excellents beats.I prefered this album to liquid swords and OB4CL
1,DON'T BUY,I wound this according to directions. It didn't hold a charge or work no matter how long I cranked the handle. I returned the product the day I received it. Waste of money.
1,Practice Safe Cranking,"I bought this for a Christmas present- it was the only model the store had, and I thought the idea was great. When the recipient opened it, I took the opportunity to read the package more closely. The back of the clam shell lets the user know that it is made with lead and other toxic substances, so the user must wash their hands after handling it! I took the item back to the store today- and will purchase a different model from Amazon."
1,Not a reliable product,"I used this flashlight for a few days to test it out and now the batteries no longer hold a charge, no matter how long I wind it. I am sure glad I didn't wait until a ""dasaster"" to test this out! (Perhaps the typo in the product name should have been a warning to me about this company's attitude to quality control!)"
1,It Just. Didn't. Work.,Not even a little bit. Totally worthless.Not even a little bit. Totally worthless.Not even a little bit. Totally worthless.Not even a little bit. Totally worthless.
1,bad,this product its too bad it doesnt work ........i hate itits tooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo bad i guess you need to put it on fire
5,See the in-print version of this book,"My full review of this incredible book is listed under the in-print description of this book. Just click on the ""all editions"" option next to ""edition"" option and below the price."
3,Only One,"This is a very interesting cd, nothing else really is quite sodiverse in a (techno-pop) kinda way."
5,One of the best albums I've ever owned.,"Just simply incredible. I could play this 50, 60 times straight. Every song is masterful. Absolutely one of the best albums I've ever bought."
5,A classic through and through !,"Joe's final album is his best ever. I loved ""Global"" and ""Rock Art""...but Joe and the Meskies really nailed it on this one! It has it all! The rock, the funk, the reggae...it is truly his best. And he hasn't rocked so hard since the Clash days. Pick this one up...you will not be sorry. The music world will never be the same without Joe. He's a legend. RIP Joe... Leather Beatle Boot"
4,Thats All Folks!,"And what a finale! Joe Strummers final album proves itself to be a real gem. The best one of all 3 Mescalaro albums.Not since The Clash disbanded has Joe made music like this.""Streetcore is a real winner!""""Coma Girl"" a great rockabilly tune from ""A real rockin gang""""Get Down Moses"" A true Roots, Rock, Reggae tune; A cry out to The old testiment prophet.""Arms Aloft"" and ""All In a Day"" are rockin tunes you might expect from a modern day Clash.Acoustic songs:""Redemption Song"" and ""Silver And Gold"" are real tear jerkers.Joe couldn't have selected better cover songs than these (for his own genius).If you are a Clash fan then this album is a shoe-in for you.If you are not, give this album a chance to broaden you musicial tastes.Well-produced, great liner notes and photographs:A MUST HAVE!God Bless The Meskies, and Lucinda Mellor.Rest In Peace Joe."
3,a bit disappointed,"I read all these reviews and I get excited then buy the CD only to be let down. I love everything the Clash ever did. I thought earthquake weather was very good. The Walker soundtrack was excellent. Loved Trash City and Love Kills. Rock Art was OK (Yalla Yalla's a great tune), I didn't like Global as much as I tried to. Same deal for streetcore. Get Down Moses is very good, the best song on the album. I thought his version of Redemption song was quite awful to be honest. I like Arms aloft and Coma girl could be a great tune but I cant get past the lyrics. The other tunes just seem to ramble lyrically and melodically and don't go anywhere. If it weren't Strummer I'd only give it 2 stars. Oh yeah- try listening to his vocal on the Blackhawk Down version of Minstrel Boy-- It'll send chills down your spine. RIP joeP.S. don't bag on me for being honest..I'm just as much a fan as you are"
5,"""Getting Down"" with Joe Strummer","Wasn't a huge fan of ""The Clash"", but as a high schooler in the 80's thanks to heavy radio play and MTV, I realized that without Joe Strummer ""The Clash"" wouldn't have existed!!! Had a chance to see his autobiography a few months ago and in the closing credits the tune ""Get Down Moses"" was played and I knew I had to find the cd!!! Joe & the Mescaleros lay down some serious Southwest sound. Great fun, I'm a fan!!!Streetcore is Hardcore Joe Strummer!!!"
5,The Testament of a punk hero.,My personal number one for 2003. Is it possible that Joe has seen his own dead coming ? Silver and gold sounds almost as a farewell.This albums proves that there is more to punk than screaming guitars.Joe has left us an album to face our own demons with.
3,Sympathy and loss don't make a great CD,"I loved Strummer. I have all of his recordings. I have been dissappointed by all of them too. I still support him though. He was a good person and his music is better than most.But, as much as I want to like his later music, I can't. Without Mick Jones I believe Strummer lost the center-that is I think he has a hard time coming up with a catchy melody. Great lyrics, cool instrumentation but ulimately, not very memorable to me.So fans, don't think I'm a traitor.P.S. Try the new Stiff Little Fingers CD."
2,A Bad Folk Singer,Sorry folks these albums suck. This is folk music like the 60's and it's badly done. Not worth the money
3,"Worth it for ""Coma Girl""","It's so sad about Joe Strummer. I'm nearly 50 and my son's 16 and we both love the Clash. That says a lot about Joe Strummer and company. There's nothing really weak on Streetcore, but nothing particularly memorable, with two exceptions. I like Ramshackle Day Parade, and Coma Girl is simply one of the best songs I've heard in the last two or three years. Powerful, anthemic, tuneful, transcendant."
4,Fantastic,"Joe Strummer's final release is an eclectic mix of genres and moods, much like Sandanista and Combat Rock from The Clash. The best tracks include the rocker Coma Girl, the reggae head-bobber Get Down Moses, the groove-laden Burnin' Streets, and the bittersweet ballad Silver and Gold. Fans of The Clash who preferred the band's all-out punk anthems may not like it quite as much, but those who appreciate The Clash's experimental side, or those who just like Joe's persona and songwriting, will find much to love here."
5,burnin' streets,"Simply one of the best albums I have ever heard in my life. During my first listen, I cried through all ten tracks, because I finally realized how much influence Joe Strummer had on me. He was at his core a street poet, someone that could have come out of the beat generation. And Streetcore is a testament to that. The 10 tracks are full of such raw emotion that it is tough not to sense it and to feel its beauty stirring within you. By the end of Silver and Gold, my heart was about to burst. Joe was my inspiration. Rest in peace."
4,Joe's Last Will and Testament,"Enough has been said about the untimely loss of Joe Strummer and the impact he had on our lives. As a very doubting agnostic, my wife asked me recently ""without a religion, where do you get your ideals?"", and the first name to come to mind was Joe Strummer. Joe is a man who I have worshipped since I was a rebellious teen and still do even as I push 40. His music and his messsage gets into your blood and your soul, and ""StreetCore"" is no different; it is a wonderful cap-off to an amazing career, albeit a little sad, as the man just seemed to be hitting his stride again when the Grim Reaper decided to make his unwanted appearance.If there is in fact an afterlife, I hope Joe finds that heaven is a more just place than earth, and that he sees his pluralistic vision of a better world come to fruition, even if we can't all enjoy it in this life.Rest in peace Joe, and thanks for the music!"
5,This is a standout album!,"Every song on this album is excellent. ""Coma Girl"" kicks it off and sets the tone for the album; story threads run throughout it. The 2012 reissue includes great live tracks. This is a must-have for any Joe Strummer fan."
5,Awesome,"This makes your hard wood and tile floors super shiny! Totally recommend this to family and friends! A little difficult to find in stores, although Walgreens does carry it!"
1,not working,The sweeper quit working two weeks after purchase.The problem seems to be in the switch. I'm trying to contact Holloway House at this time.
2,Not great,"I had previously had a shark-type electric sweeper. it finally stopped charging, so I got this one. What a letdown! It does not pick stuff up on carpets. Period. even on a runner (no nap, really just a big, stiff piece of cloth), it strugglesBut it does do an OK job on linoleum and wood floors."
3,good buy,almost carbon copy of swivel sweeper. great buy. light duty but works well for small spaces. flimsy construction. great for small jobs and light cleanups.
4,"I like it, but they don't last forever",Great device for quickly cleaning up large debris on almost any surface.This is the second one of these that I have owned. The first one stopped working because the battery didn't line up with the contacts anymore.Plan on buying a new one about once a year.
3,Sweeper vs Broom,"I really like this sweeper. My children managed to lose my broom. I decided to purchase a sweeper instead of replacing the broom. I am so happy with this purchase. It does not compare to my dyson, but it does what I purchased it to do. Great for kitchen floors, and is great for a quick vacuuming as well. I would recommend this product."
1,no good,"i owned one similar to this untill it got so old i couldnt get a replacement battery for it anymore so i decided to upgrade and buy this one thinking it would be as good as the other, pffff the handle is extremely flimsy on this and broke after 2 weeks of using. plus the brushes didnt work right so it didnt pick up very good unless i actualyl lifted up on it so the brushes barely touched the floor!!! bad bad bad"
5,Excelent customer service,"I wanted to comment on the personal-service I encountered. I received the little sweeper to which I discovered was electrically defective. I just wanted to replace it with one that worked. The customer representives not only helped me with replacement of the sweeper but reimbursed me for the correct amount of return shipping costs, which was more than was stated in their return policy. This is the way a great mail order business should operate. Amazon, you're doing it right. Shocked me! I'll be a return customer. Thanks for being integritas. Michael R. (Calif)"
2,A quick picker-upper,This lite little sweeper picks up very well but the battery runs down very quickly within three minutes. I would not buy this product again.
3,Sweeper works okay,"I have only used the sweeper 3 times. It works okay, it doesn't pick up all the debris. I wish it could be more powerful, but it does work well on hard floors, tile and carpet."
1,Would not recommend this product,"I have purchase this item in the past and have recommended it as well. However, I have purchased 4 this past year, and I'm returning the second one as it's not working properly and the return time has expired. I have two that were Christmas gifts that I am hesitated to give, as this product obviously is problematic."
2,damage very quickly,"i bought it in july2011 and it damage in november2011, also it just works with pet's hair on the floor, but didn't work as well with dusty and more heavy stuff like pet's food. So i recomend it just for pet's hair loss on the floor."
5,Very easy to use and works great!,"I ordered this sweeper after visiting my parents house for a week and my mother had one, but she had the one that is more expensive, you know the red one. Anyway this sweeper is great to pick up light messes, like those left by three, 3 year olds, and it gets dirt right next to walls and baseboards, and is very easy to manuver. It does not work very well on ground in messes, or feathers, but so far it works very well for quick pick ups around the house,in our bathrooms, and the kitchen."
5,"Great concept, very good product, exceptional customer service","My wife recently purchased this unit, and I was immediately impressed by its superiority over the Swiffer vacuums that we have had for years. It works on carpets (to a degree), has sweepers all around, is lighter and easier to use and swivels. The concept of battery storage and charging is also excellent. And it's inexpensive! What's not to like? Make sure you use this product on bare floors only or the battery will run down quickly. Upset, I called and spoke to a customer service rep, who noted that a) I should let the battery run down somewhat before recharging and b) this unit is made for bare floors only (which is what it says). The customer service rep then sent me a brand new battery pack and a card for a new free swiffer sweep + vac starter kit. Now, that's customer service!"
3,Solid Joe for long-time fans,"While it may disappoint those fans expecting another helping of ""Look Sharp!"" or ""I'm the Man,"" the Joe Jackson Band's ""Volume 4"" is a solid album worth picking up for fans of Jackson's broader pop library. Except for jaded gems like ""Little Bit Stupid,"" ""Fairy Dust"" and (arguably) ""Awkward Age,"" most of the songs here would be more at home on later Jackson albums (whether ""Night and Day"" or ""Blaze of Glory"") than on ""Look Sharp!"" That said, the trio of ""Chrome,"" ""Love at First Light"" and ""Blue Flame"" is a rewarding combination of balladry that longtime fans will appreciate, especially with repeated listens. Many of the other songs - ""Take it Like a Man,"" ""Still Alive,"" ""Dirty Martini"" - are merely passable in comparison with Jackson's other work. Nevertheless, this fan finds ""Volume 4"" a welcome return to rock and pop for a consistently solid songwriter and performer. The six-song live bonus CD is definitely a nice addition, although there is nothing revelatory here."
5,gotta love Joe,"It's a great compilation disc of his greatest hits, plus a bonus CD included--It's almost as good as seeing him live in concert. If you are a Joe Jackson fan, this is an absolute must have!!"
5,Best Album in 20 Years,This is easily the best album Joe has made since the first four from the late seventies and early eighties. Even the throwaways are good.
3,Stronger second half cannot salvage this record,"I prefer the ""One More Time"", ""On Your Radio"", ""I'm The Man"" Joe Jackson as opposed to the ""Steppin' Out"" Joe Jackson. The Amazon.com and Blender reviews I read made me think I was getting the former with Volume 4. Nope. What you get is a mix of both styles which should certainly please a number of JJ fans, but didn't really do much for me. Unfortunately, IMO, this winds up being a bit of an uneven mess. Things don't kick in until track 6, ""Fairy Dust"", a song that could have come from ""Look Sharp!"". Everything leading up to that point was sort of flat and unmemorable. ""Dirty Martini"" is also pretty good.Music fans are passionate people. Joe Jackson fans are probably some of the most loyal fans out there. Don't take this review as a personal attack, or think I'm saying this record stinks I'm simply saying Volume 4 is not for me. Listen and tell me if I'm missing something."
5,Will Be In Top 10 of 2003!!!,"Call me nuts for picking a ""Top 10 CD of the Year"" before April, but this is THAT GOOD! The bonus live disc with six songs is possibly strong enough alone, but the new studio material also is cracking. The original band never sounded better, and in fact is more mature and confident.Mr. Jackson's lyrics have not softened with age. He continues to sharply profile his current situation in life without resorting to nostalgia or -- god forbid!!! -- melancoholy.In addition to my prediction that this'll be on lots of critics' Best-Of lists, I am confident it'll be among my Top Five listening discs. There's something going on around here. . ."
4,Good as ever,"Joe Jackson has a lot of different styles, but they are all inimitably his. This album will not disappoint any JJ fan. All the songs are well-crafted and they all ""work"". There are some first-rank standouts: ""Awkward Age"", ""Love at First Light"", ""Blue Flame"", and ""Thugz R Us"". The others are enjoyable but don't have the dazzling originality of these four. With the bonus live disk, this album easily deserves 4 stars. It doesn't get the 5th because it's not the kind of unified masterpiece Joe has written in the past, where every song contributes to the overall effect; it's just a bunch of songs, all good, some great."
4,This is Ms. Mayr's debut and I enjoyed it very much,"The Rancher's Redemption by Elise MayrSilhouette Romance #1801 ~ January 2006This was a sweet romance with our heroine Kaya returning to her late husband's family ranch to ask for financial help for her very ill daughter. Seeing her brother-in-law Joshua again is the last thing Kaya wants, but she'll beg this man if she has too. Only how is she going to get the funds without revealing that Joshua has a niece. This is Ms. Mayr's debut and I enjoyed it very much. I think the book cover is very pretty."
4,Theory Plus,"This book is thorough in both its theory and explanation of card manipulation. An enjoyable reading, it is a bit lengthy, but well worth it. From simple shuffling to expert three card monte, this book gives it all to anyone truly interested in studying card manipulation. Set forth to professionals and amateurs alike in 1995, it is a one of a kind in both content and style. Made to last, it is not written in common jargon and is not fancied with useless information about the latest crazes. Erdnase uses his knowledge of cards and card manipulation to create this compelling compendium."
4,Was Expecting More Technique,"Great book, I was expecting there to be more to it from the way other magicians talk about it. I hadn't read this one yet. Also I understand why the diagrams are lacking but they could use improvement."
2,Poorly Written + Edited,"This book feels like it was written for elementary school students. The patronizing tone of the text quickly becomes annoying, and there are frequent and numerous typographical errors. The index/glossary are woefully inadequate, and I spent hours at a time flipping between the book and a dictionary in order to understand the numerous architecture terms which went unexplained.The organization of the book is decent, and it covers as fairly wide range of introductory topics, but it could do far better than it does. There are numerous pictures of important historical sites, but the lack of focus on any one site makes it difficult to gain a firm understanding of the topics being discussed."
5,unbelievable !!,"i have replaced all my Michael Bolton albums, & Phil Collins records with this one.Richard Marx, John Tesh, move over ....Bed of Eyes rule !!"
1,Not legible........,"I saw the hard copy of this book at a relative's house, and decided to order the Kindle version for myself. Very interesting cookbook.BUT, all the measurements and numbers are garbled, so the book is interesting if you just want to read it, but the recipes are unusable because the measurements read as gobbledy-guk..."
3,Pretty...pricey,"Very nice shirt, but wrinkles too easily for my job! Then I found out the hoops you had to go through to return. 15% restocking fee and $7 pressing fee."
5,An absolute steal,"I purchased these (2) Y- adapters for use with my new sub-woofers. After reading the reviews here I was pleasantly surprised to find they also come with 15 foot cables. So buying them was a no brainer. Several days after placing my order, OSD called to say they no longer had the 15 foot cables with the Y-adapters, and would I accept the 25 foot cables instead (for the same price). Again this was a no brainer (after all it's better to have and don't need than..). First off I have to say these are some of the best cables made at any price. The build quality is absolutely stunning. All cables feature locking collars which aid in signal transfer and are very well shielded. If there are any complaints (and there isn't) it's that the connectors are larger than the standard type and therefore need more room behind the components to secure them. Overall this is one of the best purchases made in cabling. I highly recommend them."
1,Buyer Beware!,"This isn't a review of the guitar, but rather the listing itself. I have ordered and paid for this guitar twice now. Both Times I have received a silver tone Offering tray, those things they pass around at church that hold little cups of grape juice! There is obviously some kind of inventory issue in their system, so just be aware that you may be tieing up your money for a few weeks thinking your getting a guitar when in realty you will receive a plate."
3,Its Ok but not great,"purchased this guitar recently,,the box it came in wasn't very strong and secured..anyone could see what was inside because of all the pictures and labels..appeared like the box had been opened during shipment..the guitar has a 10 inch slight scratch on the front of the body, I'm not going to return it because it's a hassle returning anything to Amazon..I replaced the strings, adjusted the string height,adjusted the pickups and leveled off the truss rod.(had string buzz by the first/second frets),used a sanding cloth to smooth out the rough frets..tighten all screws..most were loose..playing the guitar on my Fender amp sounded clean..on my Peavey 2/12 sounded a lot better..then used a Boss M20 and the effects made it sound a little better..the tuning pegs do not stay in tune..it looks like an LP, but doesn't have the sound of one...overall it's good for practice and or a small gig..this way I can leave my more expensive axes at home..not bad of a guitar."
4,Pretty solid fresh sound,"If you're into thrash like slayer or The Haunted, etc etc...definitely check this one out. I think they provide a slight street hardcore sound to the mayhem going on here, and that difference gives a fresh feel to the music. Definitely more aggressive than most. It's not spectacular and flawless, but definitely worth buying...definitely better than 90% of everything else out there."
4,This is genius at work...,"Jason was so good that he got his scratch recordings and demos released. Jason is regarded as one of the most technically gifted guitarists ever. He hadn't even had a chance to play to his full potential. Guys like Yngwie could only talk[...] because they knew that they were one-dimentional hacks. One of the great things about Jason was his ability to adapt and play anything. As for having no feel? Listen to ""Rain"". Tell me then. This album is totally scratch demos. There are no full production songs or anything new. It's just a look inti the mind of a genius."
1,This CD is OK but not a master piece like some people claim.,"To say this kind of guiter playing is outdated is a fair point. Jason and many many other similar guitarists - Richie Kotzen, Paul Gilbert, Greg Howe etc etc were playing this kind of thing in the eighties. To say that this is original and a master piece of fret work is an incredibly daft statement especially with the amount of guitarists around during the same era. To be honest people who seriously belive this gut is a master of the guitar, really don't know anything about the genre. Or are perhaps a little to young to fully appreciate all the other great guitar shredders that were around before Jason Becker was even heard of."
1,To say this guy is another Mozart is crazy.,"My main warning to any buyers of this CD is that there is nothing on thats never been released already. Funny that a reviewer thinks Jason is a modern day Mozart. Well it's simple, people will be listening to Mozart a thousand years from now and somehow I think Jason will be lucky if anybody is still listening to this dia CD at all in over 12 months time."
1,Look at the facts !,"In one album 'Van Halen One' the guitar playing world was inspired. In one album 'eat um and smile' the guitar world was stunned. Jason Becker has had his one album with DLR and nothing. I'm sorry but even if Jason was still playing now, he was never original enough to call elite and these old speed picking out takes show why. He never played with feel !!!"
1,Stop living in the past,"I'm sorry but I have to agree with a previous review and say this is outdated. So many guitar players in the Eighties were playing this kind of thing back then, and in 2003 it has to be said that the shred scene is totally boring. Records like this are usually only available on the bootleg market and it should stay that way. I'm sure that if Jason were still playing now, his music would have moved on. Jason was never a guitar God like Vai or Satrioni, he was a duplicator of Van Halen, Vai, Malmsteen and his pal Marty Freedman. Jason was perhaps the last guitar player of his kind to emerge from an era, which any sensible and honest musician would say, is now dead."
1,Get up to date you lot !,"This album is boring, uninspiring and well and truly outdated. Jason Becker's fretwork was good during an era that's passed. However, for those who cannot get out of the Eighties and like listening to outtakes from previously released material that in all fairness is average, they will probably enjoy this CD. For me personally, I would rather listen to something more original, so I understandably regret buying this."
2,Outdated and scrappy.,"I find it disappointing that Jason Becker is now releasing these scrappy old recordings from the past. All this CD does for me is dampen the final articles released in their heyday. Perpetual Burn and the Calchophony albums were great albums. But to now release all these old outtakes over a decade later shows signs of desperation.Whether Jason is doing this to keep money coming in, I don't know. But somebody had better tell Jason sooner or later that it is 2003, and the music world has now moved on."
4,Good alblum,"Very good alblum. Comparable in sound to Keane, but is actually better then Keane's Hopes and Fears. Also with a slightly darker edge. It is well produced. A good addition to anyone's collection."
4,Extremely Pleasant,"Thirteen Senses use piano, acoustic and electric guitars, and orchestrated strings to wonderful effect. For the sophistication of the compositions this album manages to be pleasantly mellow without ever becoming sonorous or redundant. In fact the richness of the melodies from tune to tune draw you in and keep pulling you happily along. Will South has a very good voice and the lyrics are literate to poetic. Excellent album."
4,Nothing picks us up when we are down,"Well, let's just put aside the comparisons to coldplay or keane, and then listent to the cd, so you will realize this is a little bit more a rock album than any of coldplay would be, in they're own style Thirteen Senses offer us twelve really amazing songs with good lyrics, Perfect album to listent to in a rainy afternoon."
5,Quick fix,"Worth it for the William S. Burroughs' ""Quick Fix"", one of my favorite Ministy songs! It's hypnotic!"
1,Boring Book,"Authors have unnecessarily made the book too big. Hence very, very boring to read. I would recommend Microsoft BooksOnline, which has the topics laid out very well and makes it interesting to read."
1,Basically the BOL regurgitated,"I would be surprised if you could find more than, say, 20% of this book that is not also in the online product documentation. It is far too general and shallow to be useful in the real world where most of us live."
4,Audio Lessons are also availible online,"The audio lessons appear to be available as well from University of Texas here: [...]I haven't checked if these are the same edition as the text from from Education Resources Information Center, but it looks like it. I know this isn't a review, but I wanted to add this info for others before i forgot.I cant wait to sink my teeth into this. I am excited, there is really a lack of good learning material for English speakers trying to learn Malayalam. I hope it helps impress my soon to be family-in-law."
4,Very pretty,"Pretty, sturdy but a little too loud.Also, I wish the grill in which the water falls, would be made out of a better material because the metal it's made of at the moment, gets rusty and breaks very fast."
1,Loud and Splashy,"This fountain is LOUD! If you're trying to cover up noise from a very busy street, it might work. But it definitely does not work for an office. As an extra bonus, it allows water to splash all over my desk. When I contacted the seller they suggested that I try using a different level of water. No matter how I manipulated the water level or the pump level, the splashing and the noise continued. When I let the seller know that I wanted to return this fountain, I was told that the packaging had to be ""perfect"" in order for them to accept the return. I was also told that there wouldn't be any refund for shipping and that there was no guarantee that the return would be accepted. My suggestion: Spend a little more and get a really good fountain. This one stinks."
5,Fun!,"My 7 year old daughter loves scratch magic - these were extra fun since the light shines through, making a neat effect. Wish the kit came with more than four sheets."
3,they curl up,"My daughter had fun making these, but when you put them in the window for display, they curl up when they are heated by the sun. She got so frustrated with them that she took them down :("
2,Mick Farren/Jack Lancaster - 'Deathray Tapes' (Alive),"I guess on 'Deathray Tapes',Deviants vocalist Mick Farren is trying his hand at poetry.In this case,it IS most apparent that 'spoken word' albums are NOT for everyone.Ten tracks and a running time of just a hair under 70 minutes.That was 40 minutes too long.I tried to get into this one-time gig that was recorded at a bar in Santa Monica in June,1995,but I just simply could not.The only two cuts that even held my attention were the opener ""Disgruntled Employee"" and the eighteen-minute ""Memphis Psychosis"",which is fair.At least Farren had other musicians on stage with him,Jack Lancaster on sax,Andy Colquhoun on bass and Wayne Kramer on guitar.He should have at least played some actual tunes.For die hards ONLY."
4,wrong cable,"this works fine but i thought the s-video would produce 720 or 1080i (it doesn't) i ended up getting the hdmio cable and component video cables instead - with that said, the s-video cable does produce a clearer picture than the standard analog cables"
3,shipping!,its a good cord. but i payed more for the shipping then the cord itself. and theres no other cords from the same brand.so when i buy 2 cords i had to pay more for shiping...think about local stores then online
2,I think its the cable,The cable seems to be very sensitive. I had a cable prior that was lost and it worked perfectly so I do not believe it is the computer. But it does not always recognize and a touch can cause a lost connection. Bad buy.
4,Good cable,Great cable... worked better than the $25 cable I had originally bought from Radioshack and later returned. Video quality is superb.
5,S-video cable,I bought this cable because I like the price of it.Same cable cost a lot more if you buy it from the store.It's a good product.
1,I got a Lemon,The product I received does not look like the picture. The cord was very thin but the reason I give this a 1 out of 5 is because the cord did not work at all but for $2.50S-Video Cable 6 ft. Gold Platedit is not worth my time to send it back. I'll just looks for a well made product. You get what you pay for.
2,No worky,"I tried hooking these up to my kids tv & dvd player & got nothing out of it, I didn't contact seller I just ate the loss on a faulty product, so product bad, not sure about seller... but who knows they might work for you."
5,Perfect,"The product looks exactly as the picture shows although i never understood how to use it, it looks like it would work for someone who know how to use it"
5,It works.,"It's an S-video cable and it works. Quality seems good; color isn't off or anything, and construction seems solid.Note: I have noticed some reviews for S-video cables saying you must have a 7-pin S-video connector to hook up to a 7-pin output (like on a laptop). As far as I can tell this isn't true; my laptop 7-pin output works fine with this cable which is 4-pin to 4-pin. The extra pins in the laptop output jack are used for transmitting RGB component video over a special 7-pin S-video cable, which I don't think ever caught on widely and has now been superseded by HDMI."
1,Actual item differs from picture shown,"I concur with the previous reviewer.Actual item differs very much from the photo.At the same time, it is not worth my costs sending back for a replacement since I am based overseas.This is my first time encountering such a problem at Amazon.com and it is shocking for me. Even though it is a cheap item, it is no reason to resort to this sales method."
2,Not as pictured...,"2-1-2013 RevB.Look at the picture, you can see a thick cable. This implies that it is shielded and has two twisted pars (this is what S-VGA is, according to the spec). What I got was very thin, and is not grounded shell to shell as the spec requires. I went down to the local HW store and got a cable. It too was not shielded, as there supposed to be. Tomorrow, I will go to some other places to try to find one that meets the spec's...Good luck."
4,Nice vid,"Once again I find I am short of cables to hook my stuff and make all things work. This is the ticket for making that device pass it's picture proper. Again the price is nice, don't let the shack hijack."
5,Exellent price!! Works great on my DVD capture device!!!,"The price is exellent. It works great on my DVD capture device. The quality is amazing, better than the composite cable."
3,s-video cable,"Rating is probably not fair, but I really didn't need this item as it turned out. My TV couldn't use it."
1,Junk,"I have order 2 of these blankets and the first one was heavyweight and pretty high quality. The first was ordered last September and the second one was purchased about 2 weeks ago and I am already throwing it away. It snags and the threads pull and it is complete junk. Please do not waste your hard earned money on this, you will be sorry. Too bad Amazon let you think the second blanket was just like the original and that is very dishonest!"
4,Superior weave,"After purchasing 3 cotton thermal blankets, I finally found this one that didn't shed all over the bed covers, carpeting and beyond. This is a good quality pure cotton blanket suitable for summer or in winter underneath a wool blanket to stay warm as toast. I give it 4-stars because its only available in one color."
5,Very versitile and comfortable.,"This blanket is soft and cozy, warm and keeps its shape even when bitten and pulled by a mischievious puppy. It looks expensive, but very priceworthy. I've used this all summer and even brought it camping. It washes up nicely and looks great."
1,Awful!,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... and I like shlock! There is no actual acting anywhere in the film. It's as if the people hired to play parts are reading their lines off cue cards. Lines are delivered with almost no emotional content and what there is tends to be completely wrong.The screenwriter needs to wake up and take a hard look around. Many of the actions taken in the film make no rational sense. While I completely understand the need for literary devices, they should at least have some grounding in the real world.I have no idea why some reviewers gave this movie high marks. Perhaps they watched a different film. If I could have, I would've given this movie zero stars."
1,Looks and feels like a high school video production,"Could not get past the ""feel"" of the movie being like someone took it on their cheap home video camera and got their friends to act on it. Way below what is considered a ""B"" movie."
1,lost on mars,"Dumped out it was so bad. couple days later resumed. re-dumped. I have never in my life seen anything as pathetic. Some while back my brother converted our family's old super-8 films to VHS, and dubbed sound tracks of commentary and vocal 'interpretations' over. Much, much better production. This must have been generated as some sort of psychology 101 experiment, because nobody in their right minds could suffer thru more than 5 minutes of this absurdity. It's clearly in the ""make it stop... please, God, make it stop"" category. Still, it's better than anything I could do."
1,B Rated,"B Rated, collage type class room prodject.I want my money back.not worth it at all.It was not what I expected."
5,Another Solid Record from Rufus & Chaka,"'Streetplayer' is another great record from Rufus & Chaka, this record has them placed in a more mellow smooth jazz\r&b setting, Chaka's voice is so great on this record! and Tony as always adds his unigue voice to the mix, 'Streetplayer' was alittle ahead of its time for 1978, this record is a concept album which needs to be heard in it's entirety, that's why only two singles were released 'Stay' & 'Blue Love', now this gem has been remastered, the original cd release had some audio flaws, those have been cleaned up... the remastered sound on this cd is fantastic! the sound is crisp and full, i'm hearing things i've haven't heard before... this is a limited edition so get it while you can."
5,play it again and again.,"Growing up as a teen in the seventies, I listened to a lot of Rufus. I thought they were one of the most progressive artists of their time, and me being a white boy growing up in the urban inner city, I could really identify with this genre. This album got little recognition because Chakas long awaited debute album with I'm every women overshadowed it,however this is a must have for collectors. The fusion of r/b,rock,and jazz sounds flow throughout along with chaka great vocal abilities. Two great instrumentals let rufus showcase the band. great ballads also."
2,Not great,"Though there were no reviews, I thought to myself when I looked at this item ""how bad can a step stool be?"" given that there are no moving parts and few variables. This step stool is OK. I was disappointed in two things: the finish, which seems like a cheap looking sprayed on finish (instead of a nice stainless steel) and the ""feet"" on the bottom, which are made of a hard plastic instead of soft rubber. I would not want to use them on a wood floor as I think they would scratch...and they don't seem to have the same holding power (i.e. they're more slippery) than the rubber feet you find on most stools and small ladders.Will I return it? No, it's here, I can use it, I'm not going to the trouble. But if I had read a review like this .... no, I wouldn't have ordered it."
4,step-up,this step stool with handle helps family member who has had a stroke.It allows him to get up and down by his self
5,"a nice ""step"" for us older women","I looked in local stores and could not find an item like this. I ordered it and it came quickly. I have been using it at least 1 time a day. It is a strong ""step"" and it keeps you safe if you are older . I am almost 67 and it helps me (a short female) to reach the top of things and not worry about stepping on it."
4,Great Step Stool,I looked all over locally for sturdy stool with legs and an open bottom so I could store stuff underneath it in my pantry. But I needed to be able to reach the top shelf. And I just didn't want anything ugly. This is perfect.
5,Very nice stool,Since it's just a stool there are only things that can be complained about. This stool is of excellent build and quality. Very sturdy.
3,Quilt book,"This book was in excellent condition, however, it reeked of cats! If you know what I mean. I love the book and have used it a lot (after airing it out a bit.)"
5,love it!,"This book has a wide variety of sample quilts shown. The blocks used are primarily traditional, but the samples range from true antiques to newly made traditional style to very contemporary. Basic instructions are also given on piecing a quilt. Each quilt is rated based on difficulty.One thing I especially like about it is that it has smaller (less chunky) blocks than most books qwritten for using jelly rolls or fat quarters or what have you. On the other hand, some traditional block pattern books don't give instructions for rotary cutting. This book is a nice combination.I also feel that the variety of quilt styles pictured as examples has helped me to consider using fabrics I might not have or to position colors or patterns differently. They're not all my style, but there are quite a few I plan to make. Even where the example isn't my style, I may use the blocks with different types of fabrics or colors."
4,101 Fabulous Rotary-Cut Quilts,"Although it was within the time span allowed, the book took longer to arrive than expected. However, it arrived in excellent shape, just as described."
4,"Generally good, but....","I had made 4 quilts before making one from this book, so I would describe myself as between a novice and an intermediate-level quilter. Even though I have some experience,1) I am disappointed that the instructions are not more detailed (e.g., ""assemble the blocks as shown on page such and such""). I can figure it out, but it would be nice if the instructions were more specific.2) I also find that I don't sew well enough to profit from the shortcut techniques they reccomend at the beginning of the book. My pieces do not match up well when I use those techniques, so I find myself resorting back to the way I used to construct these pieces.3) I only like a handful of the quilts in the book. However, I am constructing one that I am very pleased with, so I guess it's a matter of personal taste.In general, I think this book has a nice assortment of quilts, most of which don't seem terribly difficult to make. I'm glad I have this among my quilting books."
3,Traditional quilts. all here!,"101 Fabulous Rotary Cut Quilts! What you need here is 101 days because Judy Hopkins and Nancy Martin will have you marking each page as a must do. If traditional patterns are what you are seeking, these ladies have gathered all the ones you will ever need. Many of them are familiar to traditional quilters: Broken Dishes, Cracker Box, Jacobs Ladder, Four four time, Nine Patch... If you are on the look out for one book that has all of these designs, then this book of 272 pages will not disappoint you. Their quilting suggestions in the glossary is a nice surprise."
4,I am just beginning to review the book,I am new to quilting . I like the many patterns. Directions seem easy to follow. I do wish that more of the patterns were in color.
3,She had no scruples,"Christina Wilkerson was every woman's envy and every man's dream. She was exotically beautiful, remarkably intelligent, and compulsively driven to making it-to the top of the modeling world and to the most powerful peaks of success. Regine's. ""21."" Houston. Palm Beach. Christina wanted it all, everything money could buy. But even more than fortune and fame, Christina wanted revenge-on the rich, ruthless, cold-blooded scoundrel who scarred her childhood and destroyed her life. She's use her flawless body. She'd sacrifice the man she loved. An empire could be hers for the taking-if she was willing to Pay the Price."
5,Just Buy It!,"If you love Les Miserables, Miss Saigon and Phantom and had the pleasure of listening or seeing Martin Guerre (only made it to LA), you will absolutely love it. The story is as beautiful in song as it was in prose! I started listening to it two days ago and my CD is almost worn out! I cannot wait to get to New York to see the show....no need to say more"
2,no passion,"well recorded, but all over rather flat. James Barbour (mr Rochester) who has a powerful wonderful and deep rich voice, but use's it with no passion or colour, I have seen him recording ""secret soul"" on you tube, and this shows that while he sings with this demanding song with ease, his face shows no emotion or involvment with the song , and this evident across this recording. Marla Schaffel (Jane Eyre) gives a fine performance , but can sound a little strained in the higher notes,all in all if you collect musical shows then it is ok, but over all I don't really recommend it. spend your money on the 2006 recording of ""Company"" with Raul Esparza. a master class in how to do it."
2,I wanted so much to like this...,"I wanted to like 'Jane Eyre', because it was the epitome of the Little Musical That Could, in that we'd been hearing that it would come for years, and then it was the underdog in the box office its entire run. However, I just do not like it. I think that the problem with 'Jane Eyre' is the same problem with 'Martin Guerre' and most of Frank Wildhorn's music- they're trying to be 'Les Miz' or 'Phantom' (not a lofty goal), and falling just short, and instead the lyrics and score just seem very lost and jumbled, not sure where its going.However, something does have to be said for Marla Schaffel's performance- she does a good job as Jane, and her voice is beautiful. Still, it's not enough to save the show."
5,Great musical,"This is a wonderful recording for those who enjoy Broadway shows, in the genre of Les Miserables and Phantom of the Opera. After seeing this on Broadway, I had to have the cast album. The music is lovely and the talent is first rate. For anyone who loves musical theatre, this is a must!"
5,Absolutely Entrancing!!!!!!,"Jane Eyre is not only one of the most touching novels written, but now one of the most wonderful musicals ever on Broadway. Jane Eyre has a very beautiful score. Not to mention the perfect cast. It's heard to find a recording with a perfect cast, yet Jane Eyre has done just that. Marla Schaffel is terrific as Jane. She has a beautiful voice that flows wonderfully with the music. James Barbour, one word, INCREDIBLE!!! James Barbour has a deep strong voice that carries so much emotion. Something I haven't found in many male singers. As well as Mary Stout doing a superb job as Mrs. Fairfax. And of course Andrea Bowen as the charming Adele are two other highlights of this recording.Another person to gice credit to is Marguerite Macintyre as Bertha. She has a beautiful voice that is haunting during Sirens. The only downside was Lisa Musser not singing Young Jane. However Bonnie Gleicher still does a decent job. Overall BUY THIS RECORDING!!!!!!!!!"
2,Ho-humming on Broadway,"There's some nice voices, but not a fresh idea, in this Broadway CD. What's good is echoes of better shows (although the live musical is a solid ""B,"" it's not because of the score), what's immemorable is most of it. How can shows like ""Wild Party' or ""Passion,"" with genuinely gorgeous, push-the-envelope songs, close swiftly, while this dour show, with a lot of plaintive songs that don't sound half-bad but do all sound a lot alike, gets a big theatre? It's just not interesting work, here. Jane Eyre: as a CD, it's a great book."
1,Yawn......,"Jane Eyre is a very pretentious show. It masquerades as a deeply, emotional, brilliant show but under the over exaggerated orchestrations, gaudy costumes and sets there all that remains is a show that wishes it was more like Les Miserables but does not suceed. The melodies are repeated over and over so that the songs just blend into each other (with the exception of the excellent ""Painting my Portrait"") The portrayals are very stagnant with the exception of Marla Schaffel. Everyone but her portray their roles in ways that have been done before. Jane Eyre is not a piece of art. It is a disgrace to the broadway musical."
3,It is NOT Les Miserables!,"This is an okay CD, but to begin, it is not, and never will be like Les Miz. Don't even dare to compare the two! Les Miz is a masterpiece, with haunting songs and melodies. Jane Eyre is just so-so.But don't do Les Misérables the injustice of comparing It with this.... if you can't tell, I'm a die-hard Les Miz fan. ;-)I was never especially fond of the book, but when I heard ""Secret Soul"" on Rosie I was interested, and was excited when I received it for Christmas. It has a few good songs, like ""Painting Her Portrait"" but I got bored easily.I would really only recomment getting this CD if you're a big Jane Eyre fan. However, there a pleanty of other musicals to spend your money on!"
5,Balsam to my soul,"Doubting for a long time before I did actually buy this CD, I immediately liked the harmony of the songs, which are like balsam to my soul"
4,Perfect Match,"The music in this album really gave me the feeling of reading the book. I think the songs were well chosen and well written, except of course for the songs sung by Mrs. Fairfax... I could have done without those. Jane and Mr. Rochester's songs carry the story well and they sound lovely. For any musical lover, or romance fan I definitely recommend this album."
5,"""Floating on Eyre""","The Jane Eyre soundtrack is wonderful. I saw the musical three times, and wish it hadn't closed. If you saw the show, you definitely need this CD. Marla Schaffel and James Barbour have such wonderful voices and great chemistry together. I have listened to the CD over and over again. I was at the 4th to last performance of Jane Eyre and the actors sang their hearts out. It was beautiful. I was in the third row and afterwards waited by the stage door to get autographs from Mary Stout, James Barbour, and Marla Schaffel. They were incredibly nice!! Even though the show closed, Eyreheads still have the beautiful soundtrack!!"
5,"Lush, beautiful musical","The Original Broadway Cast recording of Jane Eyre is a beautiful score.Paul Gordon's music is lush and epical in the way that the Bronte novel is. ""Forgiveness"" is beautiful song that conveys an essential theme to this work. ""In the Light of the Virgin Morning"" sung by Elizabeth DeGrazia and Maria Schaffel convery two different points of view that contrast well. And Mrs. Fairfax' ""Perfectly Nice"" is amusing and lively. I can't wait until the show goes on tour."
3,If you liked Les Miz...,"Okay, so I saw the show in preview on Sunday November 19, 2000, for the matinee showing. The music is lovely, but let's face it: The score sounds and fits together like Les Miz. It is basically the same show with a new plot.On a side note. The sets are amazing, and you really have to see it to appreciate it."
5,Hauntingly Beautiful,"Jane Eyre is my favorite story and I loved every moment of this CD. Maria Schaffel and James Barbour are absolutely perfect for these roles and the passion of the story comes through in every note. Brilliantly performed and well written, this is definitely a must for musical lovers."
1,where is my cable?,"I have not received my order. I notified UPS about the address problem and they still have not sent my order. Again, I called them to correct the adddres and they did nothing so far"
3,get what you pay for,"cables worked, but had slightly fuzzy lines in the picture. not as good a quality as other s-video cables I have used."
5,A Nice Solution,"I bought this cable to run from my pc to my TV to watch the shows I missed w/out having to sit at my desk. This does the job nicely. If you got a video card w/a S-video connection, this is for you."
2,Spend the money on a better cable,"An Amazon shop had this for a bargain basement price, and for good reason. It has a decent picture on my 25"" television using my GeForce video card when you can see past the waves of interference. I guess the cheap price comes at the expense of decent shielding, but oddly enough the cable feels thick and sturdy. Nevertheless, pass on it and just buy a better reviewed name brand."
2,don't be fooled by the upfront cost,"this cable looks inexpensive, but then you get charged $10.75 for shipping - not so cheap anymore! i chose to go with a different cable that i feel will be more reliable for a couple bucks more and free shipping.just my $0.02..."
5,"Item worked great for me, video quality was great!","I just plugged the cable up and will be happily watching tv off of my computer tonight. The quality was great and nothing like what some of the other reviews said, I was a bit nervous thinking I was going to end up with a snowy coaxial quality picture or something. This cable however, was just as clean and crisp as any s-video cable I've used. I'm not going to doubt some of the less pleased reviewers though. A lot of companies in all industries have certain inconsistencies with their products. Some cables come out great fine, another batch is terrible...fine. This mentality sucks and I certainly hope that's not the case here, if so make sure to let the company know to send you another cable from a ""good"" batch and don't let them inconvenience you with shipping the old cable back if you can."
5,The next best thing to wireless.,I run this cable through the ceiling tiles from my projector to my receiver. The setup works and looks great just like the product itself.
3,good buy for the price,Great purchase for the price...definitely not the best out there...but it does the trick for me!
5,Its an S-video cable,Like the title says it is what it is and 25 ft of cable for something like 10 cents can't be beat. It works and it seems to be sturdy construction. Amazon had it to me within the week.
3,"Inexpensive, Not the Best Picture, but it Works","I used this cable to connect my computer to my tv. I see scrolling lines across the picture sometimes. I can't guarantee this is due to the cable, but I've never had problems in the past with this tv's svideo input or my video card. It doesn't bother me too much, but if you're really picky about video quality I'd spring for a better cable. Then again, if you care about it that much, you probably shouldn't be using standard definition technology anyway..."
5,It works great,"This works just as what I expected, no need to say more about the prod.. bla bla bla bla bla"
3,It works but eh,"The wire is way to thin, can easily be pulled to hard and snapped, or chewed thru if you have animals, I mean it does what its supposed to but can be a royal pain due to the thiness of the cord."
1,not working!!!,not working!!! i did everything what i can but this cable is not working. no picture.. no movie!!!i tried to connect from my laptop to TV and dvd to tv but all things are failed...it is useless for me...
1,DO NOT BUY THESE CABLE!,"There is con artistry at work here. As soon as I plugged these 25 ft S-Video Cables in I saw crosshatching across the image, additional wavy lines, and a large roll pulse up and down the screen. I tried plugging them into different devices, moving them away from outlets and power chords, using different TV's. The bottom line: these cables don't work. I guess I should have known based on the price but I thought if they were Amazon approved they had to have some value."
1,Terrible,"The quality of the cabling was awful, and there was considerable distortion of the picture quality using these. I threw them out ( I had ordered 2 ). Luckily I didn't pay much, but I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Exactly what I needed,All i needed was a long cable to hook my laptop to my TV through the S-Video Slots. It works perfectly and was quickly delivered. CHEAP TOO
1,S-Video & 3.5mm Stereo cable by Cmple,I'd like to inform u guys that please DO NOT fall prey to cheap price of both these cables (svideo&stereo). both cables had scratches on them even when i bought new and add to it they give very very poor performance.SVideo cable is horrible!! Stereo cable works as if loose connection...humming sound is always there. Totally Dissatisfied with both Cables........will never order again.
1,BAD quality,Bought this cable to connect the laptop to the tv as a monitor. There was a lot of static so we cannot use it. Thank goodness it didn't cost more!
3,Works good with TV,"Works good with TV rather than Projector, I would recommend 12ft S-video cable to get a normal quality of video."
4,Good for the price,It worked great for me when I had a old laptop and TV with S-Video connectivity. I don't use it any more but it served me a lot.
2,Feedback Problems,This cable definitely causes 60Hz noise problems in our setup. We haven't been able to use it because it causes a buzz in all of our audio. It's a shame because this is a very solidly built cable.
4,Nice Surprise,This is a good note to people this will come as a surprise but this does not suck infact it is a joyable tune for us to listen to.I am from the STL and I actually liked this song.I have always been a little fan of The School Boy with platinum skillsLyrics 8/10 Production 8/10 Overall 8/10
3,not a book for a crafter,"When I ordered the book I hoped it would be a help to make shell projects. Yet it was more a nice book for an artist not for an average crafter. The photos are gorgeous, but no inspiration for me to create these projects. There would not be a place for me to display them or make gifts. Yet it is a very good information about all the available shells on the beach."
5,A Very Nice Faucet,"I bought this to replace a leaky faucet & my son (not a plumber) removed the old & put in the new in about 30 minutes. Very nice quality, good price with Amazon & very pleased with the purchase.Love that prime shipping...once I tried it, wouldn't be without it."
3,"Another good book by Huggins, but what happened?","This book was great, but unfortunately it was more of a rewrite to ""Cain"" than anything else. Both had ""indestructible"" villians and ""determined"" heros. And unfortunately, both entered into new territory for Huggins with profanity (although sex didn't show up until ""Hunter""). ""The Reckoning"" - Huggins' best work in my opinion - went the whole way without giving in to the need for profanity, and the story was the better for it. Please, Mr. Huggins, we're not asking you to have to preach the gospel in every book, but give us an alternative to the profanity-laden drivel that others pass off as fiction. It serves no purpose in the books and you've already proven you can write incredible works without it."
2,Disapointing,"An interesting concept, a super predator created by altering human DNA, but a creature that is immune to moderen military small arms weapons, but seriously injured by the fangs of a wolf and the blade of a ""Bowie"" knife, was far to unbelievable."
2,A very poorly written piece of fiction.,"I was really excited to see this book in the store. I am a bit of a werewolf nut and thought this book would be an interesting read even though the monster was not a werewolf. Boy was I wrong. Mr. Huggins has no concept of what character development is. He fills this gaping hole in his writing ability by subjecting us to superfluous drivel on both the hero's and the villian's superhuman abilities. The book was also chock full of typographical errors, incomplete sentences, and contradictions. Mr. Huggins has taken an interesting concept and rendered it almost unreadable. This was my first read by Mr. Huggins and I can assure you it will be my last!"
4,Looking for action? Look no further...,"After reading Cain -- my first book by this author, I was anxious to read another. Hunter is a pretty good book, but not as good as Cain, but then Cain would be hard to top. Hunter has plenty of action, a good story, and a drop of romance. I even enjoyed Hunter's pet, the wolf. If you can suspend belief for a short while, take a look at this book. You won't be disappointed."
4,Great quick heart pounding read,"If you like action, military fiction, firearms, wilderness survival and a diverse group of characters hunting (or perhaps being hunted by?) a monster not matched by anything else in the animal kingdom you need to read this book.Yes the corrupt governmental group is clichéd, yes it's fairly simple good vs. evil plot but the unique combat, inclusion of tracking and interesting backstory combine with the things I mentioned above to create a nice thrilling quick novel you can read over and over again to get your action fix."
2,OK but not the best,I admit I liked the book enough to finish it but I did have some complaints on the way. The dialog is so lame and the way Hunter is charactorized is just a bit over the top to believe. And the plot is a mix of Dean R Koontz's Watchers and Predator. This book is good for a distraction but definatly not the kick--- book others say it is.
2,A bit of a cartoon - Incredible Hulk maybe?,"No other villan I have read about has absorbed as much lead and lived. Some of the minor charactors are enjoyable and Huggins prose is easy to read - it was just tiresome to read about somthing taking 30+ hits from a Barrett sniper rifle and asking for more. I also found myself saying ""Shoot the thing in the head."""
4,Excellent,"Although Huggins is beggining to write with continually bad language, I don't believe his books are any less exciting. I was hesitant about buying it because of all the so so reviews, I am glad I did now. Hunter still follows his military style but is an excellent read and I would really recommend buying it."
2,Evolutionary materialism from a Christian author?,"There is no doubt, Huggins is an exciting author. As a Christian, I have enjoyed Nightbriger and Sorceror as fantasy thrillers and Rora as historical fiction. I am disappointed that Huggins has written a book so deeply imbued with evolutionary materialism. It seems quite inconsistent with his other books and I hope this doesn't mean he is losing his talent to 'the dark side.' If this is an attempt to appeal to a wider audience, it probably works but Christians beware. . . this book does no glory to God."
2,Disappointed after waiting months for book's release.,"I was so disappointed with this book. Why Mr. Huggins thought he had to stoop to profanity and sex to sell his books I don't know. I've bought and read all of this author's other books (The Wolf Story, Leviathan, The Reckoning, and Cain) and couldn't put them down. But Hunter was different. I did like Hunter the man and his wolf. The story plot was good. But the profanity totally threw me off. I don't like or enjoy hearing profanity, nor do I like reading it. Please Mr. Huggins, write the kind of books we've come to trust you for! Get rid of whoever's telling you that you have to add moral decay to a story to sell it. Thank you."
5,Goodguy vs. Monster,Very entertaining. I have read it twice so far and loved it. Its alot like that old Dean Koontz book Watchers but has way more action. I wish there were more books like this.
1,A DEPRESSINGLY POOR OUTING,"Having pushed my way through the book, in hopes of some redeeming quality, I must say that it is perhaps the worst piece of tripe I have ever laid eyes on. Trying desparately to echo Jack London or Dean Koontz - Huggins loses his own voice in the mish mash that follows. Characters seemed to have stepped out of some bad television series and have no real life. Even his word choice show a sudden lack of taste. Whoever compared this to Watchers really missed a few beats. I wish I could remember who said ""The problem with the book? Why the pages between the covers!"""
3,SHOOT FOR THE EYES!,Another bulletproof monster. Another indomitable hero. Both equally improbable. Corny but entertaining.
4,"good, or is it?","O.K., I've noticed that people either absolutly love this book with all their heart or totally hate it. What side are you on?If you like the actors: Arnold, Stallone, Bruce, then you will like this book. If you like warewolves, then you will like this book. If you like big guns and big expolsions, then you will like this book. If you like violence, you will like this book. If you liked ""Predator"" then you will LOVE this book.Now, if you demand a believable plot, hate swearing, hate unnecasary violence, want down-to-earth personalities, you will hate this book. If you want in-depth conversations you will hate this book. I hope I have helped."
4,"ACTION, ACTION, AND MORE ACTION!","Hunter is the first novel I have read by author James Byron Huggins. It was a fast read that jumps off the page like a movie more than anything I have read since Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park (which made it to a movie) or Robert McCammon's The Wolf's Hour (which like Hunter cries out to be developed by Hollywood).The characters in Hunter are solid. The settings are well done. The pace is like a roller coaster. And the monster is well...a monster!The only real problems that this novel has are that 565 pages is a bit much for a simple action novel. And yes, sometimes there is such a thing as TOO much action (which is why we went from 5 stars to 4).Still, if you're a fan of action and horror and prefer to stick to a more ""pop"" style of writing then HUNTER is a great place to start."
4,Hunter,"Hunter is an interesting novel. The best I can explain the story is Rambo meets Predator. Hunter is a real page turner, with characters that you grow attatched to. There are plenty of shocking moments, as well as plenty of gore. I highly recommend this book if you are a fan of sci-fi/action."
2,Truly Terrible Writing,"The story is extremely derivative - monster on the loose, military can't handle it, mysterious loner battles against all odds, government conspiracy. The whole thing comes across like 'Aliens' transposed to the Alaskan wilderness. But it's not so much the lazy plotting that offends me, it's the truly terrible writing. The prose is not only packed full of unnecessary adjectives and adverbs, but uses the same handful over and over and over again. EVERY character is repeatedly described as muscular. EVERY confrontation between wolf and beast is described with the improbable phrase 'fang to fang'. Time and again, words are used with only the faintest understanding of their meaning. The experience of reading this book is one that passes from boredom to frustration very quickly. The only reason that I don't give it just 1-star is that it's infinitely better written than crap by the likes of Edward Lee and David Wellington."
3,Dissapointing to see the author has lowered his standards.,"I was quite dissapointed to see that Huggins has lowered his standards of the other books he has written. Now that he has become more famous, he feels a need to put vulgarity/swearing/sex scenes in his books? The other books were quite good without them. Why does he need it now? I will not be buying any more of his new books in the future. I do not need to fill my mind with useless profanity."
1,a waste of paper.,"bad writing, ludicrous and pretentious plot, suspect ideology... This book has it all. I wish I could give it negative stars."
2,"Its ok, but its seems to be the same theme in all his books","I loved Cain - but Hunter, Leviathan etc are basically the same plot and cast of character types with different names - how about writing something new?"
2,If you can not find anything better...,"Interesting idea for a plot, very poor execution. Character development is minimal to non-existent. Plot development is linear, shallow, repetitious, uninspired and often disjointed. The author continuously falls back on one tired cliché after another to support the plot. This book was actually painful to read most of the time. If it had not been for some long flights, long layovers, and only one book in my briefcase, this would have hit the trash after a few chapters. I actually did make it to the conclusion of this work, and the only positive comment I have is that the author was consistent. The best thing about this book is the hope it offers to aspiring authors. If this can get published . . . . My advice, pass this one over and move to the next book in your list."
3,"works better then the sensor 2, but...","Its work pretty good, but Mach3 works better, stay sharp longer.Already try all the 4/5 blade type on the market as well, power or not, nothing come close to the Mach3."
3,Not worth the price,The 2 bladed Sensor is more accurate around nose and sideburns and I can't tell the difference in the closeness of the shave. Don't waste your money on Sensor3.
2,2 better than 3,"I am fine with the 2 blade sensor but the 3 blade doesn't seem to shave as well, I have to go over spots frequently. Worse yet, it seems much more difficult to reach under my nose. Will go back to the 2 blade sensor cartridges when the are gone (if not before)"
5,"first rate -smooth, close shave",Subject line pretty much says it all. I highly recommend the Sensor 3 razor.
4,great sensor,"I am using the first blade. It works well I think. However, I expect it is little cheaper"
2,Not as good as the sensor,"Maybe it is my face, but I find that this razor doesn't work as good as the cheaper Gillette sensor. It seems to be the angle. This razor takes up a larger area than the sensor, so it doesn't reach into areas like clefts or turns (chin area, jaw line) as well. It works better on a flat area, like legs for example. My fiancee uses it for shaving her legs and likes it better, but I don't care for it."
5,Use with HeadBlade too!,I used these cartridges as replacement blades for my headblade (to shave my head) for the first time yesterday. I could not believe the results:-closer shave than I've had from any electric or from Headblade double or triple and definately better than the Gillette Mach 3 and Mach 3 turbo.-MUCH LESS IRRITATION than with any of the above products.The shave was smooth and easy and zero cuts and nicks. I used Headblade Headslick shaving cream and shaved in the shower.I think I may throw away my panasonic electric razor(it's a great razor) and just use the HB with the sensor3 on everything from the shoulders up!Thanks Gillette! Highly recommended!
3,Close Shave,"Gives a closer shave than the Sensor two blade but takes longer. The chartridge hugs your face with more friction, so a close shave takes more effort. If you rush your strokes the Sensor 3 will cause irritation. Also, the blades seem to dull faster than the Sensor. For the price, the design is pretty good but not great."
2,SENSOR 3 REPLACEMENTS,"Gillette Sensor3 System Replacement Cartridges, Pack of 8 CartridgesReplacement Cartridges had a different head than original. Did not fit handle we had. Not the best buy I ever made."
5,Best Gillette for me.,"I used to rely on Sensor Excel until got a sample of this blade included in an Excel pack. In Sensor 3, the extra blade does not add bulk but improves shave quality and has longer life. Finally, very good value.Recommended.More recent Gillette cartridges IMO have too many blades, which, for my face, makes it very difficult to reach under the nose.I would estimate my facial hair density as medium - well, maybe a 6-7 on the scal of 10."
4,"fits old sensor razors, but I prefer the 2 blades myself.","I have had the original Sensor for almost 12 years now, and it still works the best of the ones i have tried. The Sensor 3 blades nick me up more, the Mach 3 again tends to nick me up more as well, and any of the store brand replacement heads for this Sensor just do not work out as well as the original sensor/sensor XL heads. Its great to see Gillette has done what store brands have done long ago, add the 3 blade and it does work better than the others, but the two blades seem to give me the closest shave without irritation, and after 12 years that alot of shaving. Don't waste money on more expensive newer models, if you have this one or can get this one, blades are cheaper and it does better, Gillette sensor blades last longer."
5,A Captivating Read for Mentors,"In Big Questions Worthy Dreams, Sharon Parks affirms the purpose, promise and possibility of mentoring for mentor and mentee. She recognizes the critical role of ""meaning making"" in the mentoring journey. The reader is at once (and always) aware of the awesome responsibility of the mentor in supporting ""meaning making""at each stage of the mentee's developmental journey. Parks solidly anchors mentoring in the rich dynamic of developmental theory. At the same time, she challenges the reader to heightened levels of accountability. The examples she offers, documented from her own experience, and those of others, inspire the reader to create stimulating mentoring environments that foster growth and development. This thoughtful and well-crafted book hooks the reader from the very start raising big questions and worthy dreams for mentor and mentee alike. A mentoring must-read!"
5,great job!,I got the book within a good amount of time and there was not problem with shipping. Overall I am happy
4,Creative ideas,I made a few of the cakes out of this book and they turned out beautiful. This book has many neat ideas and the directions are easy to follow.
2,Harmonica,"received the wrong product from the vendor, Key of F instead of key of C. Emailed the vendor and they apoligized and sent the correct one out the same day. Haven't received it yet."
3,Not a Good Harmonica for Beginners,"This is not a bad harmonica, however, I bought this harmonica as a beginner and did not find out until yesterday why I was having so much trouble hitting single notes. The comb of your normal harmonica sticks out from the rest of the harmonica. This harmonica's comb is pushed farther inward instead of outward. It may not seem like it means much, but when I bought another harmonica whose comb stuck outward, I hit all single notes. Some advice to beginners looking to purchase a harmonica: Buy the Hohner Special 20."
5,worth the money,"The harmonica was in good condition. My son was frustrated with his harmonica because of not being able to bend the notes but he can not stop playing the Big River. The sound is beautiful, the playing is easy. Definitely worth every penny."
4,Big River Review,"I am not a harmonica player, so I was looking for a decent harp at a fair price. Even though I am a beginner, I didn't want to buy just any beginner's harp so I thought I would go up a step and buy this intermediate harmonica. Research told me Hohner was a very good brand, and it couldn't be more true.I am a singer and I have always loved one of Billy Joel's more popular songs ""Piano Man"". I learned the song fairly quickly and this harp sounds incredible. I couldn't be happier with the purchase, I can't wait to perform using this harp."
5,The Next Reveiw.....,"If you are farmiliar with the DragonBall Z series, you know that the main character is Goku. This is the story of his childhood. In the mountains you have limited resources. Goku does his best, and his best is more than enough! Never being out of the mountains, Goku comes face to face with a horrible metal monster! Then he meets Bulma, who is on a search for the DragonBalls. The two become partners, and both serch for the magical objects, which will grant one wish. Hopefully they can find them before the evil Emperor does.I gave this video five stars for humor and originallity. Funny this movie is! And has some good points. If you don't have it, go and get it!"
4,Dragonball (my opinion),"The series is great. The hypnotic series begins with a young boy,Son Goku, he is in search of the dragon balls( the seven mystical balls of shenlon).Well, the tape can explain it better than I can. I enjoyed the first episodes of the dazzling series and I know you will too."
1,"lasts only a few months, don't waste you money","The metal frame is decent, though even bolted down (parts not included) it sways in the wind. The tarp is utterly horrid. Ours literally disintegrated in 6 months...that is, crumbled into little pieces all about the yard. The elastic tie downs that hold the tarp to the frame also break down in a few months and begin dropping like flies. Other than looking sharp upon set up, this product is about as bad as it can be...I'm now looking for a new, stronger tarp to fit on the naked frame that now stands in my driveway. Bad, bad, bad."
4,Served on this DE,"Enjoyed the book, mostly because I served on the Hanna from 1953 to 1955. Might seem a little dull to others unless Pacific island history is their major interest."
2,Not a beginners book,"If you are looking for a book to give you a solid base in Java with practical examples, this is not for you. Although the book does compare Java to RPG (ILE), the explanations on Object Oriented concepts are poor, as are the working examples. Without this clear instruction you will find picking up the Java language difficult if you have never done any OO work before. Get the Java Tutorial from Sun. It's clearer, more in depth, and it's free."
5,Big Jeff,"Excellent, always a pleasure to hear the ""real deal,"" the incomparable Hamilton Bohannon.Jeffrey-"
3,"275 Watts RMS, not 600 Watts","I clicked on an Amazon ad (in Google) showing this subwoofer for $239. Amazon's price is actually $320. Getting past that annoyance, the subwoofer is described at 600 Watt. Only snake-oil salesmen use peak wattage instead of RMS. This sub has a 275 Watt amplifier.Advertising it as a ""600 watt amplifier"" is a no-no.""In the US on May 3, 1974, the Amplifier Rule CFR 16 Part 432 (39 FR 15387) [1] was instated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requiring audio power and distortion ratings for home entertainment equipment to be measured in a defined manner with power stated in RMS terms. This rule was amended in 1998 to cover self-powered speakers such as are commonly used with personal computers (see examples below)."" (wiki)If someone buys it, I'd be curious to hear how it sounds. With the price $80 more than the ad, and the power 1/2 of what's advertised, I won't bite. Yet."
5,Crank up the volume,"Looking for the ultimate performance of opus 57, the ""Appassionata"" sonata? Pay dirt! I'm buying this CD to get op. 81a (a live performance, not too well recorded but still worth listening to), but the samples don't lie. I own the original Columbia LP and CD reissue.I've heard legacy recordings by Cortot and Schnabel and flashier recent performances and this one shines. I think it's the sharply accented arpeggiated chord that leads into the last movement of op 57 that sets up expectations for driving rhythm, and Serkin doesn't disappoint. He takes both repeats and they just play into the most thrilling performance available of Beethovens grandest sonata. Serkin stayed on stage a little too long, and audiences who heard him in his later years might not be prepared for such virtuosity. Serkin was in his prime when he made this recording, and the last movement of the Moonshine sonata is also amazing. Fingers of steel!"
3,One of the few World War ll films that really holds up.,"A pounding war film that very realistically shows the sweat and hardship of battle. Direction by Raoul Walsh, photography by James Wong Howe, and a fine restrained performance by Flynn minus any pretty-boy heroics add greatly to the film. Some of the British were peeved at the time of its release because it failed to show the British contribution to this theatre of operations and did not give it laudatory reviews. I think they were blinded to the fact that this is an exceptionaly good war film. 3 1/2 stars, almost 4 stars."
5,One of Errol Flynn's best roles,"I know there has been a lot of criticism of this movie because of it's historical inaccuracies. Keep in mind it was made in Hollywood, which means it's entertainment with an actual non fictional story mixed in. If you want historical accuracy, watch the History Channel.In this film, Flynn shows a wide range of his ability that which he was unfairly never fully respected for. There is a few scenes in it which Flynn shows his sense of humor. For example, when talking to a frightened paratrooper paralyzed by fear on his first jumping mission Flynn asks, ""would you like a nice shot of bourbon?"" The frigtened GI replies, ""YES!"" FLynn responds, ""So would I"". It's a good scene where you see that part of Flynn that always had that glint in his eye and just makes you(me) love him all the more. Also very serious drama in the scene where they discover the torture camps of his friend. Don't miss this one."
3,Over rated,"Errol Flynn is one of my favourite actors and I was keen to see this film after last seeing it on TV 30 years ago. My huge disappointment with the film is the lack of realism. If you want to see realism see films like ""Apocalypse now"" or ""Dear hunter"". The scene in ""Objective Burma"" where they destroy the radar instalation and kill all the Japanese soldiers was so fake and unrealistic - the way the soldiers fell. There was no emotion by the troops after the slaughter. It was as if they went on a rabbit hunt. To me this was just a cheap war movie showing how America 's duty was to rid the world of the Japanese menace - see the closing credits. I may be a bit harsh in my appraisal of the movie because i am comparing it to the realism of modern films which really show the the pain and suffering in such graphic detail. The film reminded me of the war TV series ""Combat"""
5,Genre-bending crazyness!!!,"This is good stuff! 80's style keyboards stand out over versatile vocals and an even more versatile band. While it is desrving of the title nintendocore I feel more like I'm listening to a kick ass indie/hardcore/spazcore band that occasionally cuts into a Richard Simmons video. While this may sound unpleasant it is quite enjoyable and deifinitely unique. This would be a very difficult band to compare to others, except maybe to other bands with the same idea: making diverse and interesting heavy music. Some of these bands would be Circle Takes the Square, The Number Twelve Looks Like You, The Blood Brothers, Bear vs. Shark. These are the best comparisons I can make. At 35 mins, nothing is wasted, every second rocks, surprises, and excites. This is innovative, as most spazcore is, and never gets boring. Any fan of hardcore who has a sense of humor should buy this cd.Favorite song: Bunnies"
5,WAY better live,"This is an amazing cd, but their sound and talent really come through in a live show. I just recently saw them and not only do they play some refreshing music (they were the last act after two particularly dull and obnoxious hxc bands), but they are funny as hell and cool to talk to. The kid who said that only scene kids are going to like them...You obviously hasn't seen been to one of their shows. The scene kids just file out when they come on, only a few of them stayed. So, go see them live, they're great. Too bad their tour is wrapping up."
1,i laugh at them,"they hate scene kids, but they're the only ones who are going to care to seek out this crap. ""nintendocore""? please. the guys in the band do their best to appear to be pretentious ass's but they're just art-school dorks who got picked on in high school. they're just a trendy novelty act & they won't be remembered in a year."
4,Moors in Spain,"A most interesting history and perspective on the Moorish period in Spain. Perhaps because it was written in the 19th century or perhaps because the British author inserts his views. At the end, the reader is not necessarily happy that the country was reconquered and returned to Christian rule."
2,Ethnocentric Fiction,"Lane Pool's classic is very innacurate but a fun read, from a travelog perspective. However, what Jackson projects in his introduction is incredibly distorted. The reality of Muslim Iberia is quite simple: Arab armies (mainly from Syria) along with Berber tribes from what is now Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia invaded Iberia in 711. These people were Muslims but overwhelmingly white. A small number of blacks came to Spain as slaves or servants of the Arabs and Berbers. Moors, a confusing term because it has been so misinterpreted throughout history, were NOT Negroes at all. Rather, they were Arabs and Berbers. The Muslim Arabs/Berbers in Spain (and Portugal) made clear racial and ethnic distinctions between themselves and Black Africans. Black African cultural contributions in Iberia were/are, for all intents and purposes, non-existent. That is the plain truth Mr.Jackson, not the ""truth"" as YOU would like to see it."
3,not impartial enough,"The book was OK, but I felt there were too many bias comments. In my opinion the writer needed to be more impartial."
1,"Disappointing, but expected","I saw Saga go downhill after ""Behavior"" and this album clinches the deal. I could not find a *single* song that I thought was listenable, or anywhere near Saga's past talent.Time and time again, Amazon reviews are only submitted by fans, leaving far too many good reviews and inflated ratings of everything. This is an example of that. It's so bad that I'm coining it the ""Amazon.com effect"" when I run into it in other things!"
3,This isn't Brahem's claim to fame,"I find 'Khomsa' quite boring and even kitschy at some moments. Arrangements are mostly too long.Brahem's craft (or art, if you want to call it that way) is very lacking on this record and inferior to that of his collaborators. This record definitely belongs to RICHARD GALLIANO on accordion. JEAN MARC LARCHÉ on soprano sax is not bad, either. The Nordic 'rhythm section' sounds a bit alienated and out of place.I much prefer Anouar Brahem's ""The Astounding Eyes Of Rita"", ""Conte de l'Incroyable Amour"", or even ""Le Voyage de Sahar""."
3,classics,"Compared to the rest of the CDs in the Argentinian market, this serie of CDs is pretty good.I really liked it and the most important: my niece liked it a lot!"
5,Excelente!!!,"Las canciones son bárbaras. El disco es moderno, divertido y fuera de lo común.Las letras son ingeniosas y la chica que canta me pareció muy dulce.Felicitaciones."
1,children's music,Very bad.I bought this for my baby and I'm very disappointed children need real music with real instruments not a bunch of electronic sounds and bad singing.
4,Dreams,"The movie was one of the best musicals I've watched in awhile. After watching it, I waited for the CD to come out. And although certain songs that were on played in the movie were missing, the song ""Dream of Me"" was worth buying the CD and recommending it to others. Another Perfect Day is also a good song if you like alternative/punk. Get with me, Perfect World, Love will keep us together are great sing-a-longs. All the songs in general play a part in making a movie about high school love. Listen to the lyrics, that's what makes the movie beautiful within."
5,Excelent Movie,I find this movie one of the best i have seen. some people find this movie kina lame but i personally think that everyone should watch this movie. best thing is that we get to hear kirsten dunst's vocal skills.. Again.. five stars
3,What is the horns song?,"Does anyone know the song, i believe it's at the party in the movie, where it is mostly horns (trumpet?)."
2,Teen Flick Soundtrack for Movie lovers,Some of the songs are pretty good on the soundtrack. If you like the movie you might enjoy the soundtrack
3,Its average,"This music cd is only average(I would give it like3 1/2 stars). Somehow I prefer to buy the dvd when its out just for the song. I am kinda disappointed that they didn't have Sisqo's version of September in the album which is the best song in the whole movie. Allison is pretty good while Love will keep us together has its touch. For those who have seen the movie, this cd will prove quite worth it."
4,Loved the movie but not the music on this CD,"First of all, I would like to say I really loved this movie and wanted to check out if this CD was really good. I like Elvis Costello's ""Alison"", and ""Love Will Keep Us Together."" on here. What even enticed to check this CD out was Kirsten Dunst sang ""Dream of me"" during the play. I was disappointed that Vitamin C's ""The Itch"" is not on here but they made a video for the movie. I wonder why the studio took it out of the soundtrack. About half the CD is techno and it just didn't fit in with the rest of the CD. The best I can give it is a 4 rating."
4,The club song!!?,"Does anyone know the song thats in the club party scene, its like a latin tango kinda song????Really desperate to know!!"
4,"Head Bangin', Hips Shakin', Butts Wigglin'","This record is a lot of fun. Singles, b-sides and covers that flow together like a proper studio album. Fun and catchy and they even do my fave Aerosmith song. If they lost you a little with some of their Epitaph stuff have no fear, jump right back in with this which is what I did and I'm happy as a tick on a dog to be back."
2,"Okay, but not great","The lining material is flimsy. The pockets are divided from the main compartment by this material and after two months of use all the pocket dividers are ripped through. I have hardly put this bag through heavy use, only for weekend trips where I pop it into the back of my car, carry it from the car to the house. No air travel at all. Which really means it wouldn't survive a plane trip, so don't buy it."
3,I've Heard Better,"While this is not a bad album, just about all of Clint Brown's albums are better. Start with buying his older stuff and then think about buying this one."
3,An OK Best Of!!!,"This is a good Greatest Hits album, but it lacks the Crue classics Live Wire, Starry Eyes, Piece of your Action, Too Young to fall in Love, Ten Seconds to Love, The original Shout at the Devil, and Helter Skelter!!!!! I was expecting better of the Crue than this.I'd buy this only for Afraid which is the only song worth buying this for!!! If u are a true Crue fan skip this and buy the studio albums and if u are a casual fan this is a good choice."
3,lacking,an awesome compliation yes but lacking too much why only one track from shout at the devil looks that kill is a cllawssic song but wheres the original shout and too young to fall in love and one trak from too fast for love wheres livewire the bigest hit on the album and piece of you're action too many from generation swine and where is generation swine why's that not here
4,Decent Crue complation!,"The 1998 release,""Greatest Hits"" is Motley Crue's second greatest hits cd. While it is missing a few big hits,(Live Wire,Piece of Your Action,Shout at the Devil original version,etc.)it does a pretty good job of summing up Motley Crue's career up to that point. Greatest hits covers Too Fast for Love-Generation Swine,with only 94's self titled release left out. Bitter Pill and Ensalved were new songs,usually on these to intice fans who already own the original albums to buy these greatest hits. Crue's biggest hit are present like:Girls,Girls,Girls, Wild Side, Kickstart My Heart, Dr.Feelgood, Home Sweet Home etc,making greatest hits a fine starting point for those who are new to the music of Motley Crue,but as of 2005 you would probably be best to buy Red,White & Crue, a 2 CD complation spanning their entire career. Also, be sure to catch Crue on tour when they come to your town."
2,Not Many Hits,"Motley Crue, like many of their contemporaries, such as Poison and Scorpions, seemingly had only a few ""hits."" This greatest hits collection has only a handful of recognizable tracks. While those are great songs, the rest are tiresome. In fact, I found it hard to get all the way through the CD in one listening."
2,The Most Overated Hair Band,"""Home Sweet Home"" and ""Don't Go Away Mad"" are brilliant pieces that prove that Motley Crue had/has talent. Additionally they are light years ahead of all the other hair bands that littered the airwaves in the 80's however none of their records warrant(sic) a 5 star rating. They did improve when they shed the stupid makeup and machismo posturing and got clean but still the bulk of what they've done is basically simplistic diatribe about strippers/satan/girls with big hair and loads of other crap. Tommy Lee's last solo album showed promise if only Motley Crue as a group could do the same."
5,motley crue's greatest hits cd (used),The cd was shipped fast and cheap. The cd was as discribed and sounds great.
2,"Good, but really not so good, Missing alot","Well this is coming from a big crue head, and all I can say is if you are a really big crue fan that wants to collect all the crues albums get this one. But if not, and your a new fan looking for a greatest hits collection, please! go for Red White and Crue, it has way more songs only for a little more. Besides this disc is missing some of the most essential tracks from the crue like Live Wire and All in the name of..., Anarchy In the U.K., Piece of your action, Too Young to fall in love, and without you. Besides Red White and Crue has all of the missing tracks of this disc, and 90 percent of the good new songs of this cd."
2,a big let down,"Ok I bought this cd because Shout At The Devil was sold out. I thought all of Motley Crue's music sounded like the songs on Shout At The Devil. Man was I wrong! I guess the problem is that I'm not a fan of thier music after the first two albums. Out of 17 songs the only song that stands out in my mind is ""Looks That Kill"". The worst songs on this cd, I think, are: Enslaved; Girls, Girls, Girls; Same Ol' Situation; Afraid; Don't Go Away Mad (Just Gow Away); Smokin' In The Boys Room; Too Fast For Love; Shout At The Devil '97; and Without You. Another thing I didn;t like was the fact that there wasn't many songs that featured Mick Mars, but i like guitar solos.... I hoped this helped you if you are only into the heavy Crue."
3,Not quite the greatest,"I've been a Crue fan since 1983 when I cut class in the eighth grade and walked down to the the record store to buy ""Shout At The Devil"" on vinyl (you remember vinyl don't you?). I was a little disappointed with this compilation. How can they call it the greatest when it doesn't include ""Live Wire""? They could have left off ""Without You"" and ""Glitter"" too. I'm not sure you can take a band with as many great songs as Crue has and whittle it down to 17 tracks. It's ok but just ok."
2,Not impressed,I wish I would've payed more attention to the playlist before I purchased it... I don't understand how they're their greatest hits... I have to skip through half the cd while listening to it...They could've done a MUCH better job on this album...
2,a rap?,"yes, the first song features a rap. no doubt, the heart behind this was good, but the rap was a bit silly. after the first couple of songs, the cd is ok, but doesn't compare to the first two in the series. i guess i felt the first two were more sincere... but who am i to judge the sincerity of the album? that's just how i feel about it..."
4,More than just tennis,"In ""Holding Serve"", you feel what he says, more than you read what he wrote, especially if you have seen Michael played on the court. Such valour and determination, from the very first game I saw him played in our home town to the very last ATP doubles game he played in our city on 26 September 2002. Michael carried a very clear message on the court and he just confirmed it in writing in this book. I would recommend it to people of all ages and I wish to emphasize that this book is not focused on Christianity. It's a book about attitude and the way of life of THE MICHAEL CHANG."
5,Great book for tennis fans,"I thought this was a great book about perseverance and believing in yourself. I read this book a pretty long time ago, around the time I was getting serious about tennis and was able to relate to many things Michael talks about in the book. Overall, I really enjoyed it and would recommend it."
5,Best Painting Book,"I was so impressed with Painting Secrets from Brian Santos that I bought one for my friend and mother-in-law. The ideas that are in the book are so practical and made so much sense to me that I sat there saying ""Wow"". I've tried his method for removing wallpaer and it worked like a charm. I can hardly wait to get his new book Faux Finish book. Everyone should have this book in their home."
3,Not an essential for painters,"There are better instructional books for painting. This is mainly a collection of some clever good to know additions to a painters technique.Some ideas are silly, but may get the author on a daytime talk show or a cable tv house selling show. If you watch these type of shows you probably have seen the ideas already."
4,Great size and weight,This chopping axe is great for the small tasks that don't require a larger axe or chainsaw to perform. Good solid handle and manageable weight make it a useful tool.
2,The blade is easily damaged,"It has a very sharp blade and easily split my wood. Unfortunately, it is easily damaged if the blade comes into contact with hard objects in the wood... the blade does not appear to be made of high-quality tempered steel!!!"
2,It's no Estwing,"The bottom Line is, the handle is fabulous, The head Suxs...It's far to thick for any serious chopping and it just doesn't hold an edge well. I bought this thinking it could compete with my brother's ole Estwing, well, It couldn't; I should have known better. There is potential but with it's current design it is just not worth the cost.."
1,Do not waste your money.,This digital paper tells you absolutely nothing about the book. It only talks of bad pictures. A complete waste of money! I will be seeking a refund!
4,Pride of Boston,"So you want to be proud of Boston?Yes there are Red Sox and Celtics and ok, John Adams, but you ain't seen nothing yet.Read this book and tell your friends about it. Sarah herself is somewhat inconsequential...but the scences, the smells, the names, the flavors, the history...these make it an awesome read. Buy it even if you are not from Boston, but just love history and justice. Buy it for your friends.Buy it now!!!"
4,I like it better than most drug store facial moisturizers,"I tried this because I read somewhere that copper peptides are good for your skin. I don't know about the ""firming"" aspect, but I like how gentle it feels on my skin, it absorbs well, and my face looks dewy and even toned as a result. The copper peptides provide healing properties and calm irritations. I like the feel and consistency of this lotion. I recommend it."
1,Dissapointed,the active cooper percentage is REALLY low and it really doesn't make any difference. SPF 20 doesn't really help that much... and I didn't see any difference after using it for about 5 months. It feels weird and it smells not so good. I normally don't rate things so low... but this time I had no choice.
4,Good Stuff,"This doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, or exacerbate my seborrheic dermatitis. Not sure how concentrated or effective the Active Copper is. I think it gives me a slight white or lighter tint, but I actually like that."
1,Doesn't work,"Tried this for about 3 weeks and finally stopped using it because it was making my wrinkles WORSE. I have only a couple little wrinkles, but this product somehow made them deeper and more visible. I have stopped using it for about 2 weeks now, and they have gone back to where they were before I started using."
2,didn't work for me,"I've tried this face lotion and didn't work for me, I have combination fair skin ,first signs or aging and thie lotion didn't do anything, I knoe there's no magic lotions but the appereance of skin didn't improve also it leaves like a heavy film on the skin, also tried he serum and didn't like it either , may be it works for other types of skin."
2,Not moisturizing enough; doesn't rub in,"The major problem is that there's a layer of film which can literally be peeled off like a layer after you apply on your face for about a couple hours. Most physical sunscreens form a layer of white film, but they are usually rubbed off bit by bit as you touch your face, etc. However, this one seems like once you accidentally rub off a bit, you are literally starting to tear off a layer of significant surface area."
4,Another good product of the company,"This face lotion has been up to its worth so far. It has not done any miracles on my face but it feels very good on skin, and merges nicely. Good for oily skins! I have bought other face lotion from same company otherwise I would have purchased this one again.Now, I don't know for what reason Neutrogena people decided to give such an irritating design to the bottle! When last 10% of face lotion is left you literally have to shake the lotion down, or scrap from inside (which is no fun I tell you!) This is the ONLY reason I omitted another star from it. If this reason doesn't look to you as big deal, I would say you gotta try this product!!"
5,Miss the product :(,"I bought it because it was a face lotion more than anything. My skin is normal, not too dry, not oily and loved this product. I used it for years now and I can't find it anymore.. I miss it. I wish I can find it somewhere.."
4,12 of the biggest and best of the Mercury years,"The liner notes and the photos are worth the price of this collection. The performances, the songs, etc. all deserve FIVE stars as the last 50 years of sales and popularity have proven. The only reason I gave this collection FOUR stars is because it contains only 12 cuts, 35 minutes of music. Certainly this could have had 18 cuts as the COLLECTION from the UK has."
4,What Can you say about Patti Page ?,"Songs like ""Tennessee Waltz"" take me back to my childhood when my Grandmother had that song on an old 78rpm record.along with some other great country songs but if you want some good music this album has some of the greatest songs of Patti Page's Career worth buying20th Century Masters - The Millennium Collection: The Best of Patti Page"
5,One Beautiful Songstress.,"Let Patti Page take you back to a place in time when music meant something. Her songs brought people closer together. Americans were more in harmony with one and other. I was a kid when Patti was popular, but she was so beautiful, on stage and screen. We watched her TV show in black and white, but her songs were so relaxing and enjoyable. Patti was so gorgeous and entertaining, you couldn't take your eyes off of her. More importantly, her music was smooth and enchanting. I am so glad music like this is still available. I think you'll really enjoy the sound of Patti Page as I do..."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed because most of the Patti Page songs have glitches in the recording and the songs stopped several times when playing...then eventually started up again. Also, I wanted to download them to burn my own cd and couldn't do so. I am pretty computer savy but sad to say, I couldn't burn my own cd as I have done many times in the past....so I don't plan on buying anymore music from Amazon....or anywhere else. It seems that burning my own cds is a thing if the past! I guess ""time marches on"".....and technology."
1,wrong item shipped!,"I was so disappointed when I opened the package this past friday. The last thing I was expecting was ""the best of Patty Page 20th century Masters Millenium collection"". When I opened the package, inside was a DVD of the movie HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER which I did not order. I returning this movie I didn't order back to you and I want what I ordered and paid for which is the CD of Patty Page."
5,Go Benni!,"Always a pleasure to read another Benni Harper story! I look forward to a new story every spring, and Arkansas Traveler sure didn't disappoint. As usual, I couldn't put it down until I'd read the whole thing."
2,"I hate to be the one to mention this, but . . .","I found this Fowler's weakest attempt. The plot worked; typical Fowler. The characters, however, have begun to grate. I searched in vain for a non-disfunctional personality in the book. Gabe and Elvia came the closest, but Gabe is playing the same role in each book now, like a sitcom. Elvia at least was allowed to move forward, but this isn't Elvia's series. Benni bounced around with the usual mix of stubborn/stupid/doormat/smartmouth--it's getting old. And I felt preached at. The heroine is a Baptist, fine. But, I don't buy these books because I want to read Christian fiction, and Arkansas Traveler moved in that direction. Bottom Line: I started skimming a third of the way through, and ended by only reading the pages that contained Emory's name. Emory and Elvia have taken over, are the most interesting, and our hero and heroine no longer appeal. This was a looser for me."
2,Sermonizing,"Arkansas Traveler was disappointing to me--clearly the weakest of the Benni Harper series. The engaging, affectionate descriptions of local color were more than outweighed by the preachy, moralizing sections that read like a poor movie of the week. Not only the characters of the ministers in this book offered sermons; the book read as if the author filled in set characters to prop up the message. Subtlety has never been Fowler's forte, but this book belabors the obvious repeatedly. How Benni uncovers the clue that leads to the solution of the mystery rings false, although in general the plot works. Her continuing characters saved this book from being tossed aside less than half way through."
5,Characters spring to life!,"I was so drawn into the town of Sugartree, Arkansas, and what was going on in everyone's lives that when there was a murder, I had to sit back and remember that it was a murder mystery. Earlene Fowler sure can bring the characters to life.Gabe is, well, better than ever. So, if you are in love with him already, be prepared to fall even deeper! And, it's wonderful to really get to know Elvia better. You'll feel her emotions right along with her! Dove and Aunt Garnett are always a source of fun and once again, they don't disappoint.Thank you Earlene for another top-notch book! I loved it! Is there a higher rating than five stars?"
5,Mystery Story with a Quilting Angle,"As an avid quilter, I was attracted to the title of this novel, which is a traditional quilting pattern. I enjoyed the references to quilts and quilting along with an entertaining whodunit. The main character is a contemporary young woman who appreciates and respects the older women in her family--not just feminist, but womanist. The political issues explored in the book are ones of concern to all of us today grappling with the blending of many cultures."
3,Disappointing,"Surely there are better, more detailed books on shibori. I paid more than the current Amazon price, and I wish I had spent my money on one of the other (more expensive) books. I suspect I will donate my copy to the public library for those who have no prior knowlege of resist dyeing, or those who would like to see what they are getting before they buy."
5,What a Bruch,I have done a lot of painting and always purchased my brushes from Home Depot and someone left this brush so I used it. After using this brush I looked at all the local stores to get more but had no luck. I like this brush so much I bought it online and paid $7 for shipping which is well worth it.
3,Just My Type...Debut From Punchy,"Punchy reminds me of one of my favorite bands The Refreshments a band that offers up simple rock songs. Imagine if you will an ice cold beer in hand at a Austin Texas bar listening to tunes with friends. The songs are simple stories told through music sung with heart and done in such a way that you gotta sing along! Catchy little ditties that may not earn a Grammy, but should earn a place in your CD holder.Self-confessed Joe Strummer lover, Fritz Beer says of their sound, ""I think we're midwest rock but not so guitar top-heavy."" The describes their sound as ""Knock-out Texas roots rock with the soul of Wilco and the power of The Replacements."" I'll buy that.I'm loving ""Just My Type,"" ""Standing on Legs of Lead"" ""Tease Me Through the Bars"" and ""Only Words Are Left."""
1,Nothing to it.,"The opening credits of this one actually says ""Written and Directed by Stuart Canterbury."" There was NO WRITING involved here whatsoever!First, a dark-haired prostitute is shown touching herself in an alley. Next, a blonde is shown writhing alone on her bed. The third scene cuts back and forth from a girl in lavender lingerie to another girl in a black bikini. None of this makes any sense so far.Finally, we get two girls together in an alley, rubbing ice on eachother and then making out. I'm thinking that maybe it's finally getting interesting. WRONG. Next, we've got a couple of girls in fur coats drinking and making out. I'm thinking that Stuart Canterbury must have been drinking when he ""wrote"" this.The last scene shows a tattooed girl dancing in fron of a mirror. She removes her clothing while she's dancing. It sounds more exciting than it actually is. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,Awsome,"The other reviewer is right on the money. These last, they feel great and you can wash them. Over time they are really worth the money!"
5,Inspiring,Those not familiar to Seraphim Rose will discover in this book a modern ascetic monk who shone with the ancient tradition of Orthodoxy. But Fr Rose was writing inthe nineteen seventies and reflects an understanding of the sensibilities of modern man. This is just one of many great works by Fr Rose that are cherished around the world. Highly recommended.
4,lecture transcript,"This is a short book, but very poignant for our time. It records a guest lecture given at UC Santa Cruz about 20 years ago. His own explanations, anecdotes, and illustrations are quite good, and he also includes quotes from Alexander Solzhenitsyn.The introduction by Hieromonk Damascene is brilliant as usual.If you get a chance, check out the audio tape of Fr. Seraphim's actual lecture. Available in underground bookstores and catalogs."
3,"Good, Not Great. Marred by his Crude Views of Catholicism.","There are some real nuggets in this book, but the book -- which is the text of a talk Fr. Seraphim Rose gave -- is a bit sketchy and incomplete. It is also marred by Fr. Seraphim's reflexive and unsophisticated assessment of Roman Catholicism. Catholics who have knowledge of the Orthodox would hardly claim -- or come close to claiming -- that the Orthodox don't have valid sacraments. But Seraphim's assessment of Catholicism is crude and unsophisticated. It is clear that Fr. Seraphim was a holy, good man. And his understanding of religious experience reminds me of things I have read in Luigi Giussani and heard in the lay movement Communion and Liberation. He is definitely worth giving a try. Still I was disappointed in his reflexive dismissal of Catholicism."
1,Don't bother with this one,"I'm still not sure if the artists on this recording are really the Gaithers or not! This is some collection put together by Madacy, the Canadian outfit that routinely makes things sound more inviting than they actually turn out to be. Waste of money."
2,Well...,"It gets the job done, but it's prickly on the face. The bristles could have definitely been a lot softer."
3,Merck Manual review from a lay person,I am not a doctor or in the medical field. I simply purchased this manual for my emergency preparedness box. The manual is written for doctors so some of the terminology obviously is above my knowledge. However the book recently came in handy when I and my pediatrician suspected my 16 month old daughter had Rotavirus. I looked up the symtoms and general treatment and I felt a little better after reading more about the virus.
5,A must for every one in a human body,"If my doctors would have read this book, I would definitely be in a healthier condition. But all my propaganda did not help. In Switzerland they prefer Harrysson, which is larger, but therefore no doctor has the time to read it. The Merck Manual seems to be the best book for concise information about diseaes, diagnosis and therapy. The authors are high level in their fields and still present there topics in a comprehensible way. But still, some knowledge about physiology is assumed. Pathology can only be understood as a deviation from physiology."
5,great referece book,The Merck Manual continues to be a well organized reference book that covers a broad range of health topics/disease. Great book!
1,Good for the lay public,"I am a Medical Doctor and a board certified anesthesiologist. This book would be a valuable asset to the lay person, but lacks the substance necessary to be considered a reference text for medical professionals."
5,Merck Manual,"As a nurse for ages, this book never disappoints. Great reference for those with medical background. Too medical for most laypersons."
2,Not pleased,"Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings was what I was looking for. I was interested in Leonard Bernstein conducting and ordered the CD. The Adagio is on there, along with another piece that does not seem to fit the mood of the Adagio.I find myself listening to the Adagio and then skipping the central Ode to Ben Shahn, or whatever it's called, and then moving on to the last piece, which I don't recall the name of, but it too is enjoyable."
1,"You ask me to review - I have ordered this more than a month ago, and do not have any issues yet.!","You are asking me for a reviewv of your service. I ordered this subscription over a month ago. Still have not seen an issue. By the looks of it, I won't even get my Sept. issue. What gives? On the confirmation, I should receive my first issue sometime between July 11 & Sept.24th, 2007. THIS IS CRAZY!! And you are asking how I like my order? NOT!!"
4,Great buy!,I needed a glove that provided wrist support when I workout - I wasn't sure from viewing these online whether they would work but decided to try them. They really are perfect for what I needed!
2,He got better on his second CD,"Not bad, but just a glimmer of the brilliance he displayed on Accidents By Design."
1,Lee Canter's Assertive Discipline,"My experiences with Canter's approach have been disappointing. It can be that this approach will work, though not with the students who have the real problems, but it does NOT TEACH students how to control their behavior. It does not teach students anything except how to receive rewards and how to avoid punishments. Better to read some research on classroom management, Alfie Kohn, or Love and Logic. I believe what we need to do is help our students make better choices. I don't think this approach does that. Read lots of things and decide for yourself."
3,Little Red Bookk of Firehouse Pranks,"I purchased this book for my husband, who is a Firefighter.I read it along with him and all of the stories rang true,as He had plenty of his own stories through the years.It was a delightful read :)"
3,"Ignores ""the classics""","There's some decent stuff in here. I can't believe, though, that he didn't mention what it's like to rip a real good fart while your buddies are following you into a raging inferno. Singed eyebrows, anyone?"
3,Cooking the Swiss Way,Cooking the Swiss way is a simple book with basic Swiss recipes. It also gives a broad explanation of some of the Swiss customs. It is a fantastic book (5 stars) for the young cook in the kitchen trying new cultural recipes although for the more advanced it misses its mark.
5,A Classic Movie,"Our daughter grew up watching this video until the tape wouldn't play anymore. She has always remembered the movie, even reciting from it through the years. I found it on Amazon and decided to get it for her for Christmas, and I know she is going to be thrilled when she opens her gift...and she's now 26! I just wish the movie was offered in DVD form. Good thing we've kept our VCR handy."
4,Great movie,"Still a great family movie even though its on VHS. Good quality and a good deal. If you like the muppets and have a VCR, you should get this."
5,Mod/Punk landmark album!!!!,"This is quite easily THE most important release of the genre since The Jam's 1977 debut ""In the city"". ""SingReadySteadySmash"" has already risen to the level of a classic album by music collectors due to it's relative obscurity, the band's fabled history and most importantly, this C.D. contains some of the best Pop/Punk ever recorded! This is my happenin' and it freaks me out!!!!!!"
4,Ditto,"An entertaining story that tells of the Wars of the Roses from a more personality driven aspect. This book is ann excellent way to learn about this historical period. The only problem I had with the book is that Weir, sometimes switches back and forth between using peoples given names and their titles. I guess this is a difficult think to avoid because first sons were often named after the father and titles were transferred only after the previous holder died. Conveniently, Weir includes a genealogy, but even still it is sometimes difficult to keep track of the characters. The nature of the beast, I guess, I haven't read a royal history yet that I don't get the characters confused halfway thorough."
4,A Facsinating History Un-Tangled,"Alison Weir's treatment of the Wars of the Roses is a concise presentation of the causes and effects of that tangled period of English history. Only a serious student of the subject would desire more details, but the aim of the book is to interest and entertain the casual reader, while presenting an accurate un-tangling of the complicated causes and course of this old story. The Wars of the Roses is sure to be a favorite nonfiction title of any fan of historical fiction. Not since the release of ""Through a Distant Mirror"" has a popular nonfiction title succesfully presented the peculiar politics, pageantry and magnificence of the end of the medieval era. A must-read."
4,Good Telling of a Dreary Story,"Many of Weir's books read as though she has cobbled together unused index cards from previous histories. ""Wars of the Roses"" is better---it is a cogent and fairly lively account of a confusing, low point in English history. A good general history of the ""wars""."
4,"Good book, wish there was a key to the genealogical tables","I'm really enjoying this book, but do find myself turning to the family trees at the back quite frequently (though this doesn't bother me). One thing I can't figure out, though, is what exactly the two symbols in the trees mean. There's one that looks like an elongated cross. This, I believe, means the end of a royal line. The other symbol, on the other hand, I can't make out at all. It could be two crossed swords? Could anyone help me out and identify the meaning for me?In any case, a very enjoyable book. I've enjoyed all of Weir's books that I've read so far. She writes a clear and interesting history. It's only the nature of the beast that the names get confusing, since all the royal families used the same set of names for their children and the titles passed all over the place."
2,Other places to start,"As a general outline of the period, the book is tolerable (not even Ms. Weir can get dates wrong). Ms. Weir's noted biases and haphazard use of ""facts"" would cause me to look elsewhere for a book."
4,Alison gets some respect,"Zip over to the reviews of Weir's ""The Princes in the Tower,"" and you might come away with the impression that the author is a puppet of a Tudor ghost, being manipulated by corpses.Oh well. Richard III incites strong opinions, so maybe Weir was asking for it. But with the horse guy a child and teenager for most of this book, she can sidestep controversy and exhibit her real talent for blowing life back into the Middle Ages and illustrating the humanity behind the pomp of manuscripts and proclamations.The narrative is exciting, the profiles thoughtful and the story holds well together. Sorry, Alison, for all the nastiness the princes are bringing you. This book lets you shine without historical murkiness clouding your sun."
4,A fascinating - but also very complicated - story,"The book tells the story of the first War of the Roses, between the Houses of Lancaster and York (the second being between Yorks and Tudors). You don't have to be a history geek to read it, but it certainly requires your constant attention, especially if you are new to the subject - like I was when I read it. It's not the kind of book to skim through or put down for a long period of time before you pick it up again.I'm not sure if the author could have done a much better job in presenting the story, since the story itself is a very complex one. However, there were times I got tired of the meticulous narration and wished she had focused on the larger picture instead.So if you're considering buying this book, keep in mind that it narrates one short, yet complicated, episode of history, and it does so in one breath and full detail. If you're a curious and persistent reader, then go for it."
5,Excellent purchase experience!,"I purchased the DVD as a Christmas gift, and the recipient of the gift absolutely loved it and the quality of the DVD was excellent."
5,A Must-have CD and DVD!!!,"I love this CD! My favorites are tracks 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 12. And the DVD is even better. You can dance with him on track 12 (Bishop Neal's Praise). All I can say is make room on your Ipod for this CD because there are a lot of gems on it."
3,LAYZIE BONE SHOULDN'T GO SOLO EVER AGAIN !!!,"THERES ABOUT 4 OR 5 GOOD TRACKS THAT ARE WORTH LISTENING TO.MY FAVORITE TRACK IS #19 ""AS THE RAIN"".THE BEAT ON THAT TRACK IS ON FIRE AND LAYZIE BONE HAS R&B; TALENT,I GIVE HIM MAD PROPS FOR THAT.IN THIS ALBUM ""THUG BY NATURE"" ONLY HAS FLESH-N-BONE.THERE ARE NO OTHER BONE THUG MEMBERS BUT ALL OF THEY'RE NAMES ARE SAID.I THINK I CAN SAY I DON'T EGRET BUYING THIS ALBUM.... ."
3,DISAPPOINTING,"Finally Laysie's cd comes out the one all Bone fans have been waiting for since we heard ""mind of a souljah"" unfortunately he doesnt live up to the high expectations he had. While Layzie stays true to his thuggish background it becomes repetitive and tiresome after the 6th song the raps actually arent that bad and neither are the beats but its just a boring listen. however there is hope as he ends the album very strong with the last 4 songs easily the best on the album hopefully we will hear better from layzie soon with a new bone album coming out before the end of this year"
2,2 to 2.5 stars,"I bought this album knowing that it would be Layzie Bone. The second best bone member, and all the other bone cd's where tight so i thought this one would be good too. Even though he didnt work with bone on it. I was so wrong with this. At the very most there were 2 good songs on the whole cd. The lyrics werent anything what i thought they would be and just the over all tracks really made me made. I have listened to this cd a few times since i have purchased it, but thats about all. If you like any of the bone thugs buy it, if not dont waste your money."
4,L Burna,"There are mixed reviews for this cd. Personally i think it is ill. Im not really a fan of bizzy bone, hes ok but doesnt compare to krayzie and layzie. Layzie here gives us some of the Bone Thug sound we'd expect but also throws in things you would not hear on a bone thug cd, and does a good job. Tracks like Make My Day and Connectin' The Plots with tha underrated WC i think are really ill. He also throws at us things which we COULD hear on a bone thugs cd like As The Rain which is another hot track and Still The Greatest. Basically every song on this cd you can say its between ok and real good, no song leaves you saying..what is this?? and thats good. This cd is above average, one thing i would have liked to seen was an appearance by krayzie bone but what are ya gonna do?"
2,L-Burna...Who The Hell Is That!!!!!!!!!!,"First of all his name is Lazy Bone, not L-Burna, why do all the rappers these days change there names, no one will even know who they are any more, Lazy was good in bone thugs, he is good in this to, but if he would just keep the name lazy bone it would be even betterL-Burna? Damn"
3,perry ellis blue with a perry ellis red min,"the box was in perfect condition but the only wrong thing is that the miniparfum was red instead of blue, and this was for a gift to my sister in law, but anyway she liked."
5,Space Age Pimpin,"Lost was the best album to me in 1998. 8Ball didnt have a song i didnt like. He spit flows that are just outstanding. He is my favorite artist of all time but he just dont get the credit he deserve. Songs like Its All On Me, Put Tha House On It, and Lost speaks for itself. To tell you the truth he got 4 songs that could beat some of these weak artists whole album now thats sick. Ball is one of the realist mc in the game."
5,8ball did a HELL of a job on this record!!!,"Hell Yea, Mr. Bigg the phat mack has shown the world the rappers are more than just East and West coast supperstars. This record is very rich with beats and lyrics. 8ball's ablum is packed with a different style I would tell everyone this the best rap ablum released this summer."
5,"3 CD's set, YOU KNOW its gotta be good","8ball has only 2 cds on this, but the 3rd one is a suave house compilation. its got new songs from too short, A+, canibus(the sh*t talker), crucial conflict and more. 8balls album is tight I like the song my homeboys girlfriend. 8ball raps about experiences that have happened to him and he tells them like a story. he raps calmly and smoothly GO GET IT he has tight south beats throughout the 2 cds"
5,Da Best,I LOVE this CD. if you like it 2 than also get: Jay Z-hard knock life Dmx-Its dark and hell is hot Master p-Da last Don and OutKast-Aquemini
4,NURSIE makes Katrina look like Minnie Mouse,"This chick is nuts and over-the-top hysterically out of touch! A great campy little gem of a film that is tongue-in-cheek and winking at the genre withgood fun and some real scares. Maxwell gets some great angles and somegothic rawness from the Louisiana swamps. The chase scene in the marshy bayou is great fun! The music grabs the horror atmosphere by the throat and there's some great rural tunes as source. Love the Strauss during the tour of the house to visit the patients. A nod to the offbeat musical choices of Kubrick.A fun, sleeper, independent popcorn film! Swampy!"
5,"Campy, Guilty Pleasure","This indie feature made on a shoestring made me thankful I came across it. My emotions ran the gamut on this one. I laughed at some of the really scary parts, then looked around to see if anyone heard me. I wasn't sure I was supposed to. It's funny and suspenseful in the strangest, most original way. After I saw it, I went to bed with the following prayer:""Please God, when I get full-blown dementia, please don't send me to Nursie's assisted living home."""
5,Perfect Horror Film!,"Scary... but not ""satanic""... What a ride! At times, I could almost feel the humidity and smell the death in that creepy old house... my heart pounded... Nursie is truly one he__ of an actress... Miss Savannah, I loved you! C. Thomas' character is like the perfect frat-boy-turned-doctor... so smart but totally naive at the same time. The writers are amazing!...who thinks like this? I wanna party with you!!"
1,Don't believe the hype!!,"This is a cheap, rubbishy knock-off of Misery. All of these over-the-top positive reviews are obviously generated by people who created this 3rd-rate garbage, and their friends! Save your money and avoid this boring Misery wannabe."
3,Kata Camera Case,"Absolutely first rate camera/video camera case. It would probably survive an earthquake or direct lightning strike. One problem, though, it is too large to fit in the overhead compartment of a plane and I wouldn't trust it to survive airline checked baggage."
2,Won't fit in airline overhead compartments,"When I purchased this product I had no idea that the size and shape would be such that it absolutely won't fit in any overhead compartment, on any airline.Why would Kata manufacture a bag like that? I mean let's face it, this is a soft semi-rugged bag, which means it was made for keeping in your posession. You can't check it or it would be destroyed, so if you can't check it and you can't carry it on, what are you supposed to do with it?If it wasn't for this fact, the bag seems OK. But it's such a critical flaw that I can't recommend it to anyone, and Amazon is getting mine back."
4,long play,"i have only found this one on long play and have never seen the 14 track yet anywere,i would like it tho! but no one can provide me with more than the lp 10 trackhowever from the whole lp 10 track there are only 2 tracks actualy worth listening to and that's howl in the sky and singin' in harmony(maybe the actual titletrack biscaya is more in the range for vangelis fans but not realy my style,regardsannyone however who can provide me the additional tracks i would gladly welcome at babcom5@telenet.be,my name is jozefi've only put in my first reveview so don't kill me for it!"
5,Profound,"This was an amazing book. I read it years ago and then picked it up again to find its pages still rich with wisdom. I absorb more with eaching read. Practical, relevent and profound! A treasure trove of ways to improve your Self and your life."
5,Practical Business Planning,"As with his other books John Chandler has been able to produce a book which, through it's great detail and case studies has help me run my business. It was with great pleasure that I am writing this review as I know that this book will help those who buy it."
2,fine but broke after a few months of light use,"I was pretty satisfied with it for a few months, trimming grass every other week in a small yard. Then recently I noticed that the nut cap holding the entire assembly kept coming loose, rendering the whole shears unusable. I tried to tightened as much as I could, but it would continue to fall off until it disappeared all together. Seems like this is due to some design flaw, as I have not had this problem with other shears in the past."
5,"Groundbreaking, accurate, important medical journalism","This book recounts in exacting detail the adulteration of the critical drugs needed by cancer and other critically ill patients, the result of a investigation by a group of dedicated Florida policemen and the author. This fact-driven, exhaustively researched, and beautifully written account is a compelling read, and one which (as an academic physician and cancer specialist) I found impeccable. It is an essential book for anyone for whom the integrity of our medications are important--which is everyone in this country."
1,Worst Rip Off Ever.,"First let me say that the merchant gave excellent service and answered my inquiry as to the figures.As to the product, this is one of the worst rip off's ever. 54 figures means that you get the same group of figures three times. I wouldn't spend more than a dollar or two on the item. What do you need three Lenin's or three Stalin's for ? If you are thinking of buying, contact me and I can sell you one of the three duplicates I have."
3,"Wonderful Book, Poor Typeset","This is a fine book, full of ideas that will make you reconsider your garden - planted or planned. So many unusual plants, such limited space and time!However, the type the publishers chose for the captions - and there are 250! - is tiny. And against an otherwise attractive mottled background they are very difficult to read - even for good eyes. One has to read this book as one would study a text -under good light at a table. Forget the soft light and easy chair. The total experience is much less than it should be given Nol Kingsbury's expertise, pleasant writing style and excellent assortment of photos."
1,no shine,this cleaner is not the same quality as the one we got at home depot. the shipping costs were almost the amount of the product. it left our floors dull and looking worse than before we used the product. not a good choice - will never buy again.
4,Very good floor cleaner,I've used this product and like it because it does not leave any residue and cleans my wood floors well.
1,"Great product, bad price","The product is actually wonderful; I use it all the time, but one of the previous reviewers is right. It is twice as expensive as Lowe's. I gave it one star on its price, but I would give it five stars on its quality."
2,Disappointing effort from a hip-hop genius,"Having already purchased the previous two DJ Cam albums ""Substances"" and ""Underground Vibes"" my expectations for this album were high.However when I finally got to hear it,it was largely a dissapointing and frustrating experience,Cam gives us glimpses of his talents on tracks like ""I Love Hip-Hop"" and the collaboration with Channel Live ""Broadcasting Live"",but for the rest of the album he loses sight of what it is he does best which is making top class hip-hop.Most of his experimenting on this LP falls short of his usually high standards,his forray into speed-garage being a prime example.Overall I am sorry to say that this album comes over as a stale and lacklustre effort from a man with real talent.If you want to check out the true Cam sound I suggest you check out ""Substances"" or ""Undergerground Vibes"" both true Cam classics. D.Horler"
1,dissapionting from cam,if you like cam and his work then don't buy this!! Its terrible just regular rap hip hop with only one or two songs recieving the cam touch! very dissapionted with this cd!
1,Extremely Disappointing,"Definitely not worth my $. After hearing some of his other works, I expected to hear more good trip-hop tracks with The Beat Assassinated but this album is a major disappointment. Needs more DJ'ing skills a less reliance on rappers to get a good album."
4,Cam's best to date,Dj Cam displays a mastery of many different styles while putting his spin on them. A must have for the Cam fan.
2,This Is a Rap Album: BLAH,"Having been spoiled by first hearing DJ Cam's awesome ""Mad Blunted Jazz,"" album this CD was complete disappointment. Although you can hear traces of DJ Cam's skill in the background, horrible rap vocals destroy the whole mood. This CD is a loser."
4,A GOOD POH SUPPLEMENT WITH SOME OVERLAP,"This booklet covers mainly the fixed gear powered by the 150 and 180 HP engines with most of the info relevant to the other Cherokees. It includes loading and performance charts as the original POH does, but expands on information not found there. I wish the original POH for this aircraft was as informative as this book. Just the existance of this type booklet by ASA is telling as to what is lacking in the Cherokee POH. The book states it is not a replacement for the original handbook. I feel it is good supplement."
2,A sad excuse for a POH,"This would be an alright book for a person who's never seen the plane to get familiar with it, but that's about it. There is no tech info, no performance data. It attempts to cover about 30 years of piper cherokee/warrior performance and updates while being as vague as possible. Its sold at many FBO's as a replacement for the POH-sad, because it lacks any of the tech info that you'll need to complete even a short VFR flight plan. If you want a couple nice pictures, and a description of how to do a preflight of a generic ""cherokee"" this is your book. If you are looking for a personal POH, keep looking."
5,The best if the best,"I've bought a ton of books and watched a lot of DVD's and everything you need is covered in this book, so if you interested in model railroading and esthetics this should be the first book you buy"
4,Good book,Useful for creating scenery for collectible cottages as well as railroading. Has a lot of information on inexpensive methods. Much better priced than videos designed for collectible cottages.
4,great for building rocks and mountains.,"Very good advice. excellent Step by step approach. The book tries hard to keep up with the latest technology and trends. I have the first edition, which I believe to hold a better overall perspective of scenery construction and color theory, which seems to be missing from the current edition. The two editions do complement each other quite well however. This edition goes into a great deal of detail of realistic rock outcropping construction. it would be nice if other aspects of scenery creation were treated with as much detail and finesse, such as trees, water, ground cover and prairie grass.-BK"
3,Too advanced for me!,The author is very talented and detailed. I am a novice and like my ideas better. Free ideas are available by searching online.
3,"Five Star Music, Performance.... One Star Recording","Marketing, or rather packaging is everything and the 1955 rendition of Gould's Goldberg Variations continues to resurface in different clothing, yet always the same, brilliant body of work. The music is superb, the play inspired, but the sound on this recording - remastered though it may be -- seems uneven, retaining the distinctive ""hiss"" of the original LP. This background noise is most distracting on the slower, quieter portions; less evident, if noticeable at all, on the faster, louder passages. Nevertheless, it is a landmark recording worth owning for historical value. Pricing is good; however, a few additional dollars will buy you a first order recording (e.g., Perahia; Gould's ""A State of Wonder"")."
5,1955 in better sound,"To clarify: this is the 1955 recording that has been given a freshen up by the Sony engineers now in DSD sound. It's better- not light years but enough for me. Then we get some more Gould, that really, I wish wasn't there. One time listening to it is more than enough for me.Great recording. Of the two Gould's I now prefer the second but I wouldn't be without this one either."
1,Not even worth the money,"I wasn't expecting much for a low cost CD, but this was worse than I expected. The ""reggae beat"" (and I'm being generous in calling it that), sounded like someone simply hit the Reggae key on a electronic keyboard. The same beat just keep repeating though out the entire CD without changing.As if that wasn't annoying enough, some of the songs aren't complete. The singer would start one song, apparently get tired of singing it and move on to another one. I have no idea why.(Something to keep in mind, this label is selling a lot of different Christmas music CDs. All of which sell for a similar amount. I bought several different ones along with this title. All of the rest of them were good. Most I would give 5 stars to. It is just this particular CD that is bad - I don't think they know what reggae is.)"
1,the best thing about this movie is the cover.,My friends and I tried watching this based on the awesome cover that features some bald mouth-breather with an eye-patch and shotgun. Not redeemable on any level--unless you're looking for some softcore.
4,AND THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS.,"If Good Night, and Good Luck makes you yearn to dig further into the Murrow mania, then this box set fits the bill. Murrow was often creidted with inventing broadcast journalism, and it's easy to understand. The four-disc set includes live broadcasts from the London Blitz and shocking reports from Buchenwald, the best of See It Now (including Grandma Moses and Louis Armstrong), his bold challenge of Joseph McCarthy and his ""Red Scare"" and the landmark 1960 special documenting the plight of migrant workers. See it now. And forever."
1,The book was pointless,After watching the show every Monday for the whole sessio I was sure to be first in line to pick this book up to check out everyone at a closer look. I was totally disapointed with it and did not like the book at all.
5,ARIA ROCKS!!!!!!,Aria is an interesting and heartfelt read. You have really created a winner. I recommend it to all my literate and literary friends. I want to be the first to get your next publication of short stories!!!!! CONGRATULATIONS SUSAN
1,Doesn't work and causes razor burn,"I used the original Venus razor for years, but lost it, so I decided to 'upgrade' to the Venus Divine...and I've regretted it ever since. Even with a brand new razor head, it consistently pulls hair instead of actually shaving it. Even then, what little parts do feel shaved, are completely raw with razor burn. I've used it through 3 brand new razor heads, figuring maybe the first one I used was defective, but it's been bad with all three and I'm finally done with this product. It's going in the trash and I'll be purchasing a different brand."
1,very disappointed,had to use old razor to finish shaving...my new Venus Divine did not do well at all for me...very disappointed after paying the price.
3,Disks out of place,"It was a christmas present for someone and when it came and I was going to wrap it I heard disks moving. I opened it and around 3 of the disks was out of place in the box set. They was not scratched badly, but obviously they were cause we watched them one night and it started freezing on a couple of episodes. Very disappointed. Definatley since I bought a faster shipping so it could get here before Christmas. Again, very disappointed..."
3,Great show,I gave this 3 stars not 4 the show bc everybody loves raymond is one of the best shows ever made but the reason is the dvd cases i have never seen such a huge case its twice the size of the rest of them idk why they made these so freakin big for this show
5,Good times,"Sure it's the same ol same old...but do we ever change ? i enjoy the show , it's like stopping by my friends house , the show is funny , the dvd is fine , and real good quality picture , and it's just my kind of show. The actors are so good at presenting there characters, but the one thing is, has anybody ever noticed the kids are not in it very much? Half the time , i forget they have kids:)It's a clean show , and very funny..i can watch it with my kids , and that says a lot."
1,What Rocky Mountain?,"Garbage CD, canned sound and all. This is the worst Christmas album I've ever heard. I think this was done in someone's garage."
1,DO NOT BUY!!,Ours kept falling down- even though my husband and I have each had our share of successfully installing shower curtain rods before. It just kept on falling and was not able to be re-adjusted easily. We gave up and purchased two seperate rods.
2,Dual shower curtain rod,we could not get the rod to stay in place no matter what we did.we will be returning the rod.
4,Gerat shower rod,this item is great we remodeled our bathroom and wanted to have a two curtians it is perfect for our bathroom
2,Polder Duo Shower Curtain,"This is the second one that I have owned. Where the moisture collects, it tends to rust. It is not easy to install, it takes two people and then does not stay in place well. The shower curtain hooks get cought in the middle. I love the idea of the two bars, but the product is not what it should be."
3,Falls very easily!,"Great idea, but doesn't work that well in reality. It falls quite frequently if one opens the curtain too quickly and accidentally tugs on it. One side falls and other is dragged with it. Has lost tension already, though I just purchased it in April. Very difficult to get back up--NOT a one-man job! Won't buy another double rod. Just purchase two individuals."
1,Terrible,This rod rusted within months and was hard to remove. We had to cut it to remove it. I would not recommend this.
4,Dual use shower rod,"We have used this for about a month and it is great when you have a bathroom that doesn't have room for enough towel racks. We are happy with it and I would recommend it. However, installation is definitely a two-person job. My husband is very good at doing things around the house, but it took the two of us to put it up. It is not difficult, it just takes a person on each end."
4,I like it,"Nice curtain rod if you don't plan on taking it down and reusing it. As other reviews say, once this goes up you can't take it down without cutting it. I put the rod up by myself although it says to have two people. I'm sure two people would make it easier, but it was fairly simple for myself. I've only been using it for a month so we'll see how it holds up. For someone with a small bathroom like myself, it's nice to be able to put a towel on one bar and have the shower curtain hide it."
3,Stainless steel with rust???,"This item had brown scratches on it when i first removed item from packaging. Hope it's not rust. Besides that, this is a great design."
5,"""I used to dream souls, puffed up and sighing""","BITE EVERY SORROW is a multihued book full of both a strange sadness and the glowing wonder of laughter. ""If there are oceans to saddle/ if you could get there, catch the horse/ if you are holy, long enough/ the suger will be taken from your right hand."" Ras writes. She provides the saddle, and if you are holy enough, it will certainly give you an exhilarating ride through the lush scenery of her soul."
2,Remastered but still lacking.,"saga is remastering their entire collection. So far the first three saga releases sound great and have all the art restored. Steel umbrellas however is not one of my favorites. To add to this I own a polydor and a Bonaire version of this cd. The bonaire version has a song called WALKING ON THIN ICE and its better than most on the disc. Considering saga is adding bonus tracks why didnt they add this song instead of I WALK WITH YOU LIVE.I also own NEVER ALONE and WHY NOT as sinle edits on a best of, why no bonus tracks of these, the space is there. So it seems the remasters are like the SAGA WEBSITE never quite complete and always leaving you wishing there had been more. My comment on this one, skip it if you already own it."
5,McCloskey's Block Party,"This book would be a great gift for a beginning quilter because it is so well illustrated and the text is easy to follow. For an advanced quilter, this book is like a reference because there are 120 different rotary-cut block patterns along with projects to inspire! I have decided to make a queensize quilt using every single block in the book. This will take some time, but I already have the block pieces cut and in their respective little plastic bags. The quilt will be indygo blues and white, so the focus will be on creating movement with the perfect placement of each block."
3,Not a Reference,"This book is mediocre in both content and instructions. I purchased the book for the cutting instructions to be used as a resource and reference, and in many places the cutting instructions are unclear. I would not recommend this book for a beginner nor intermediate quilter."
4,Great selection of 9 inch blocks,"This book has a great variety of 9 1/2"" blocks (9 inch finished). If you wanted to make a block a different size you'd have to redraft it. Many beginning and intermediate piecing classes teach students to make a sampler from 9"" blocks. This book is a natural next step to continue adding to one's repertoire without having to experiment with too-tiny pieces. An excellent book for different sized blocks is ""Around the Block with Judy Hopkins"". I found it to be a good companion to ""Block Party""."
5,I LOVE this book!,"I really like how you can use this book over and over and even with other books and blocks. I like the map feature and the mix and match ability of the blocks. I wish it was availble in other sizes too. This is my favorite quilt book, I have used it so much that I have split the binding! It would be great if it came in spiral bound!"
5,Great for quilters and want-to-bes,"What I love most in this book is that she takes a quilt block and shows it in different arrangments of dark, middle and light tone fabrics. Each gives a vastly different feeling and expresses how different a quilt can be depending on the fabrics and fabris arrangements chosen."
5,Block Party Review,Great book! Has so much information and many blocks to choose from. A must for any piecing quilter.
5,Best block book ever,"I have over a dozen reference type books for block design and construction, but this is the best one by far. The rotary cutting directions are amazingly clear and simple. This is the one I go to first every time. I buy this as a gift for all my quilting buddies."
3,"Good, but not great","The hat was good, but there were two drawbacks: (1) It doesn't say ""Conductor"" on it and one person joked that it looked like a French Policeman's hat and (2) when viewed from the front, you realize the visor is actually asymmetrical -- it's not perfectly straight, but kind of lopsided."
4,Costume,"I decided to be a conductor for Halloween, so I purchased this hat. I have a very large head, so I feared that it would not fit, but it fits very well.It is not cheaply made like many other costume items that I have seen in the past. It has a realistic look and does not appear cheap."
4,old,Portraying a little hard career of this great artist named Thalia. The album contains songs and greatest hits of his early career as a soloist in 1990.
3,Sensacional!,"Well.. I still don't have the cd, then I can't talk about it's graphic design, or something like that, but what I do can talk about are the songs. These are songs of Thalia's olders cds as a single singer, which are just great, from the time that Thalia had a style like.. more rock, you know? And 'Marimar' is the theme of one of her most sucessful telenovelas, that have the same name. Also, one of Thalia's greatest songs, in my opinion, is there: 'En La Intimidad'."
4,an excellent single!,"Purchased this CD primarily for the ""Time of Our Lives"" single that has been on the Jeep commercials lately. Definitely love the song. The other mixes are also quite good as well. It would have been nice to get the original ""connected"" mix but I suppose nothing is perfect. Overall, very good CD with some nice beats."
5,A Smashing Hit!,"Another hit by PvD? How come I am not surprised? This song is absolutely fabulous and the vocals and beats are terrific. It's also quite similar to one of his previous works, ""Nothing But You."" If you like that song, chances are you'll enjoy this one. I am pretty sure that I heard this song somewhere else (besides from PvD), but who cares. If there is another song, PvD just made it 10x better."
4,Just what I needed,This was just what I needed to keep all of my access badges and IDs secure and close at hand.
3,"Don't expect clear, even though the product description says it.","I imagine most people ordering these like my selve have a badge that is color coded. A blue plastic changes the color of the badge and there by makes the holder useless. The product it self is fine, its the same unit the other vendors have. Semi hard plastic, nice clamp but a bit flmsy if any side to side pressure is applied."
5,Eye Opener,"Living in the Unites States, the war in Lebanon was what I saw on TV. Perhaps because of our bias media, I never felt pity like I did during the Kosovo problem. Reading this book made me realize what the war did to a wonderful people, the Lebanese. The author is brave and does not hesitate nor spare your feelings."
2,Ego got in the way of a good book,"The basic premise of the book is good, but the author tends to rely too much on recycled material , such as contributions from his magazine, without taking the time to realy expand upon the topics. The author should either expand his cases, or have his contributors use fresh material - recycling is for material goods, not stories."
3,"Good material, less good bridging of topics","While this book has merit for what it presents, it jumps around too much, and leaves this reader with more questions than the book can actually answer."
4,Undergrad Masterpiece,"This text is a great introduction to Fluid Mechanics. The derivations are very easy to follow, and the problems apply to many real life situations. For graduate students, it may be a little to light weight, but for undergrads it provides a broad base of information."
2,Bad book and a rip-off.,"The soltution manual explains the solutions well, but the text does not even do a sufficient job presenting the material to reasonably expect that the students will be amply prepaired to solve the problems--though many still will be able to, due to the simplicity of many of the problems and the general reasoning of engineering students.Plus, these guys are crooks; they release a new edition every year or so. Why? Only to change the cover, the problem numbers (but the same problems and same solutions)... oh yeah, so they can sell more books and charge more for it!"
3,Where's the beef??,"Lot of fluid problems, good graphics, and very good examples, though not nearly enough. You're going to need good lecture notes or a tutor."
2,WAY too expensive for the quality,"This item is entirely particle board & sells at under half this price at your local ""W-Mart"". Assembly takes about 2 hours, incl all hardware. It's quite heavy. It looks nice (take care with the surface, mine scratched easily during assembly) once done & from a modest distance. It also is fine if you don't want something that's real wood or high quality, or don't want to spend a lot. I just wouldn't spend THIS much. Buyer beware."
5,Second time around.,This is the second cart I bought so that pretty much tells you how much I like these things. They have room for plenty of sewing and embroidery equipment and supplies and are decorative to boot. I would recommend them for any home sewing or hobby room.
3,excellent for the price,"I'm learning a lot from reading Kandinsky and it is wonderful to have his writings all in one place. This version has publishing hiccups (some page repeats, distracting word spacing, occasionally blurry printing) but no deal breakers and for the price I paid (used) it's a good deal. Five stars for content, one or two stars for presentation. If you're fussy keep looking but do not overlook Kandinsky."
4,Excellent,Due to the size of the book it is not easy to carry around with me but I am enjoying it immensely especially as I find the English translations sometimes better than the French.
1,Ouch! It burns! It burns!,"30 seconds after applying Clerz Plus this evening, I had to pull my lenses out ASAP and flush them with eye wash due to severe irritation. Beware!"
3,Handy but fragile,"This saw is able to do a lot of things that other saws cannot. It actually works in lathe and plaster for cutting outlet holes without destroying the surrounding plaster. You have to move slowly and carefully however. It is also great for shaping holes that are just off center and those types of fix up items.The negative. This saw is absolutely not heavy duty. In three months rotozip has replaced 2 saws as the shaft locking mechanism breaks if you look at it. After it is out of warranty one can just use an allen wrench to lock the shaft. I doubt that the entire saw will last much past the warranty period. I would probably go for the heavier revolution although I am not sure it is much better.I'd buy it again but my expectations are that one needs to consider this an item that you will replace after a year or two, if you use it once a month or so. If you use it more often I would look for a much heavier saw."
1,Not A Quality Tool,"I purchased this tool about 18 months ago. I never used it during the warranty period. My son used it once to drill a hole in the bottom of a ceramic pot. My son-in-law used it once to cut out kitchen laminate counter top for a cooktop. First time I used the tool was the cut out a piece of dry wall and the tool started falling apart. The shaft lock button was difficult to engage and when I started the tool the buttton flew out on the floor. Now it busted and the shaft cannot be locked to change cutting bits. Altogether, the tool has been used for less than thirty minutes and it started flying apart. I am amazed at how flimsy the tool is made. I would not every buy another one."
1,Busted Shaft Lock Button,"First reviewed on July 25, 2004. I did fix this unit with a home-made remedy. Busted shaft lock button while trying to loosen the bit. Took tool apart and observed cheap plastic case material deformed under torque of loosening bit. Drilled out deformed plastic, used 2 part epoxy to mend broken hole. Tried the fix, works OK but I have to put a nail straight thru the new hole I made when removing the bits. This tool has maybe 10 to 15 weekend jobs under it's belt, not hardly used at all I defenately won't be buying another Rotozip. I own aprox 30-ish high quality shop tools and powwered hand tools and this one was/is one of my least favorites. The adjustable router base always seened flimsy to me and frequently needed tightening. The bit removal was always a dull spot with this tool."
1,RotoZIP a disposable tool,Shaft lock failure after lessthan 2hrs of use. the Shaft lock ejected itself from the unit. It was inserted back into the unit without the spring... the shaft is now in the locked condition and the shaft lock will not backout. I'm not happy! buyer beware.
2,Overheats easily,"Be careful with using the attachments, especially the large cutting disk. It overheated my unit and caused the shaft to expand and jam. Had to chuck the unit after using it only 3 or 4 times. What a waste. Not a heavy duty machine. Good for artsy-fartsy types. Good concept, not a hearty enuf machine for me. I was cutting a pet door in my very thin walled metal house door. It worked great, but jammed before the job was done."
1,Rotozips are not repairable,I had the misfortune of breaking the small shaft lock pin in a Rotozip SpiralSaw. Rotozip does not repair tools or sell replacement parts. But they will gladly exchange the unit ... . Quite a bit for what appears to be a very inexpensive pin.
4,OLDIES FANS,I BEEN TRYING TO GET THIS CD FOR A LONG TIME ANDTHIS IS THE FIRST TIME I`M SEEING THE SONG I`MLOOKING FOR AND THE RIGHT PERFORMANCE
3,Sequel,"This is not mentioned in the description. White Orchids, the story of Jeff and Camilla comes first. John Saxon is minor character in W.O. It is much better to read W.O. before S.B."
3,Ok,"This was an ok read. It is very Christian and sweet, but I am not sure I would read anything else by this author. I did enjoy the beginning and how he saw what he wanted and went after it. I didn't read the first book and all the characters at the beginning wasn't too bad, it can be a stand alone read. I guess what bothered me was the preachyness.Of coerce these aren't my beliefs in the book so it is hard to read about that kind of narrowmindedness, not that I am picking on that religion. It's just not what I believe and therefore hard to read."
4,Danner Workman work boots,"Very comfortable work boot. Most comfortable work boot I have had yet. Do not know about the durability yet, if they last a year it will be worth every penny.12-20-2011 This boot is still holding pretty strong. I am starting to notice more foot fatigue at end of the work day. If you use a toe cover/guard - tuff toe always!"
5,"My daughter loves her ""Loopy""","She named her elephant Loopy and loves him. He is a good size to snuggle with and even use as a pillow. He has held up through the wash and through a toddlers ""love""."
5,So CUTE!!!,This elephant is so cute and soft. Im very happy with my purchase. This matchs the NOJO JUNGLE BABIES that I have in my babys bedroom....the size is great.
1,Dated,This video is dated. China changes every few years. I visited in 1997 and then in 2008 and the country and its people were remarkably different so I would buy a more recent video.
2,Below Average,"This is a below average welding helmet for the price. Got it for some hobby welding. Where this helmet lacks are the adjustments for the headband. They are all plastic and of poor quality. I tried to tighten the knobs enough so the helmet would stay up over my head to prepare work, they be able to flip the helmet down with a shake of my head when ready to weld. Couldn't get this helmet to do that. One of the plastic knobs stripped and I had to super glue it. Considering if it's worth sending it back."
3,This helmet turned me into a pro,"So I was new to welding and this was my first welding helmet. I had about two hours of playing with the welder when the helmet decided to stop holding itself up. This made me have to balance my head like a nutcase before having the helmet drop hard. This worked for about an hour. At which the helmet decides to level me up and completely breaks at the portion where its on your head. So basically it forces me to learn one handed. I still have it and just used it again a few days ago. My welds are pretty awesome.. IF, I have a real helmet one day, my welds will be extraordinary! By this if you want to become a pro and PRAY you get the self destruct model as I did."
3,welding helmet,"It is a good welding helmet, but, the hardware for the headband is made out of soft plastic and the screw threads for the pivots strip easily"
1,Utter tripe,"One of the worst cozy mysteries I have read. The storyline was all over the place, the characters were cardboard cutout with horrible names to match.The writing was stilted and I could almost see the writer preening in the mirror admiring her witty prose. The suspense was non-existant because I was too busy being irritated with the language. You won't be missing much if you miss out on this one."
4,Smells great!,"Love this soap! I'm particular about my soaps, and have really sensitive skin. I first tried it at a hotel where it was a product in the room. Turns out, it is great for sensitive skin, too. Expensive but smells so clean! :)"
4,Works great but not perfect.,"I use this brand for 5 years. Four years ago I had a few problems with two tapes producing masive drop outs.Then I witched to Panasonic and it has never gave any drop outs.Sony however had stronger signal which is impotant in low light settings.So, I swithed back to Sony and use it with my Canon HV-30.Recommend."
5,turn me on ; Kevin Lyttle,This song is HOT!!!! It makes a bad mood turn into a good me.Where ever you are when it comes on youjust wanna get up and dance.It's a song that puts you in the mood. He will be very big Kevin Lyttle.
3,Not bad for generic commercial trance,"Let me just preface that I dont think this trance compilation is bad, I just wouldnt say it was all that great either. it does have a few half decent upliftng vocal trance songs on it. Most of the songs sound very commercial and almost cookie cutter like. For someone who is just getting into trance, this is definitely a nice pick up. I guess ive become spoiled because im used to listening to good progressive stuff. The vocals arent that bad either if you're into vocal trance."
2,"Great overview, where's the meat","I found this book very usefull in presenting an overview of the issues that a business owner will be facing when starting a new business. However, the book never really touched down anywhere, skimming all topics.Though my appreciation of what it takes is much greater now and better informed, I still feel the need to buy a book delving deeper into the requirements that a business owner must fullfill. I will have to buy another book or get professional advise, as such the book has failed me, it should have been called - An overview of issues a business owner should know."
4,CD re-released February 2012,"Phantom, Rocker & Slick CD will be re-released February 2012.Recorded in 1985 and at the time it was on vinyl and cassette only. The band wasLee Rocker, Slim Jim and Earl Slick.Go to Lee Rocker's website for details."
4,Lovley Voice,I love her voice. She is so talented in everyway and I have never heard an Irish singer sin beautiful. Not that their bad. But I would really recommend this album for anyone that cares
4,it's just the same!,"i just hate the record company for releasing a special edition thing, i got myself 2 album, i original and one with the extra tracks, like this one!her first album was really good and worth a buy, with songs like ""gotta tell u"", ""baby come on over"", ""always come back to ur luv"", ""lately"", ""body II body"" and several more, these already make the album a hit. with the extra tracks of ""the boy"" and a few more, it doesn't make this album better, just by featuring her little brother, well, just like i said, this a a great album, it will not harm u to get this album with some extra tracks, but if it's not working, it's not working, just like that! sorry totake away a star for the extra tracks!"
3,Gotta Tell You It Isn't So Great,"Impressed by her fresh, funky ""Gotta Tell You"" and comparable teen queen dance moves, I decided that I wanted to see what this seemingly bright star had to offer. Was I disappointed! There is nothing more to Samantha Mumba than meets the eye- a Britney Spears copycat groaning away in most of her Geri-Haliwell-gone-solo style songs. Besides ""Gotta Tell You"" and ""Baby Come Over,"" Samantha Mumba finds herself desperate for new material. And am I the only person alive to realize that in most songs she's just talking? Girl, if you're gonna talk in your songs take up rap. If not, look into some more vocal training."
3,GOTTA TELL YOU THAT THIS ALBUM IS GOOD NOT GREAT,"Why this album is getting (5 star) reviews I can't quite understand.Samantha Mumba is new to the pop scene this album is good pop, but the strongest songs on here are the first two singles ""Gotta Tell You"", ""Baby, Come On Over"" which samples Kool & the Gangs Top 10 smash from the late 70s ""Ladies Night"".The album is good but the rest of the songs are not great...this is no Fleetwood Mac ""Rumours"" or Beatles ""Sgt Peppers"", this is Samantha Mumba with a good pop album.However there are some filler songs like ""Lately"" and ""The Boy"" remix is good but not great. I really am finding it hard to find another Top 40 smash on this album except for ""Baby, Come On Over"" her latest.Samatha does sound reminiscent to Chaka Khan on a few songs, has a good voice. Not a bad album, just not GREAT!"
4,good music but the movie's better,"the same thing happened to me with this soundtrack that happened to me with the soundtrack for Y Tu Mama Tambien -- I enjoyed the movie so much that I rushed out to buy the soundtrack, but then I discovered that the music didn't stand so well on its own -- but it's still good music and worth listening to"
5,I loved this though I do not know Spanish,"I loved all the songs on this cd set. I'm not much into OSTs, but after seeing the movie, I decided to add this to my collection though I did not know Spanish, afterall, music does not have any language!Nacha Pop's Lucha De Gigantes and Control Machete's De Perros Amores just blew me away. Highly recommended."
5,great soundtrack,"It is totally urban , so if youre looking for music for travelling around a major city like mexico city , you will feel inside the movie."
2,[price]?!?!?!? Are you mad?,"Gustav, well done. Control Machete, well done. If you don't like listening to latino music, i'm talking about tejano and all the rest here, the rest of the tracks are fairly boring. Really, really, really not worth [price] unless you're into that type of music."
1,MISSED,"Never got this. Ordered it a couple of times. But, each company I ordered from found that they didn't really have it. From what I remember of the songs on here, the disc would rate 10 stars if it really did exist."
4,Acid Trip on CD,"This type of music is called Minimalism and it's not easy to listen to. There are lots of other composers out there that have done simliar work but Phillip Glass is the most well known. This is a great album if you are really into music theory. One of my professors stated, ""This is the kind of music that sounds better on paper.""I think it's more like an acid trip gone terribly wrong."
4,Love it!,I am an abstract painter and I love to listen to this album while I work in the studio painting.
4,Philip Glass' Glassworks,"Very typical of the composer. This CD presents two works, each with 5 or 6 movements and is for different instrumental combinations which makes for good variety. If you like Philip Glass' style of minimalism, then this CD is to be recommended.Philip Glass: Glassworks"
2,"Good Source Book, Bad Mechanics","If you want a book to tell you all about different starships in the Star Wars universe, give you plenty of D20 RPG stats, and tell you how to modify ships, this book is for you.If you want a book that gives you playable rules for space combat, you are out of luck. The new combat system is just as screwed up as the main RPG version. For Space Combat, go see Star Wars Gamer magazine #8."
2,Severly Lacking,"This rendition of Starships of the Galaxy for 3rd Edition Star Wars is severly lacking in any real detail. The Original for the WEG edition of Star Wars which is D6 instead of d20 had more detail, but still left a lot to look for. WotC needed to add more of the equiptment stats for ships, such as cost and actually add a sample of every ""stock"" ship since it is called Starships of the Galaxy and it only has a few of the lesser ships and doesn't even have the standard YT1300 that the Millenium Falcon is based on. I would only recomend this if you wanted to completely your set NOT as an actual reference or source book."
2,Not Worth the $... i paid for it.,"Where to Begin...This book is not what you want. Granted, this book has About 150 or so Spaceships described, With Basically full stats and a short biography for each, There are very few inaccurate pictures of Each. Each picture may contain up to 7 ships, with merely a sidebar to say what ships are included in the picture.While i don't actively play The Star Wars RPG, I am interested in simply learning the rules so that it may be adapted to D&D;, or some other RPG World. This is Not what i expected. I expected More ships to be explained, More pictures, and better descriptions. If your looking for an indepth book thats worth the time to invest money in, Look somewhere else."
4,A rare find,"in the realm of mazi-singles. This is a diverse work even though two of the four tracks are remixes of the same song. You could never tell it. Like Mason and Dixon, the book and the personages, this covers uncharted territory."
3,standard RDJ fare,"""On"" is a beautiful, standout work by RDJ. It mixes harsh beats with aetherial piano lines nd dreamy rain effects. A very good song, even for RDJ. However, I wasn't as thrilled by the other songs on the single. ""73 yips"" is a standard RDJ noise-screecher, and I haven't counted the ""yips"" so I don't know if the title makes sense. ""d scape"" is typical RDJ atmospheric ambience with a throbbing beat that kicks in over the sparse tune after 2 minutes. Finally, ""xepha"" seems like a cross between the earlier ""73 yips"" and an alien pig pen. really! Overall, the single is worth it for ""On,"" even if you aren't an RDJ fanatic."
3,great for hw6945,This is great stuff. I used it for traveling. It charges my phone ipaq hw6945 slowly but it works. The cord does get jammed up sometimes so you have to put it back nice and slowly.
2,Does not tell much.,"If you are interested in the history of comics then this is A great book for you. However if you are interested in drawing and selling comics you DO NOT want this book it says almost nothing about the actual drawing part. Although it does has A few helpful hints such as shadow, different inking styles and helping you decide whether you should use a brush, pen, or marker. All in all I decided it was not very good at all and think that How TO Draw Comics The MARVEL way would be A much better investment for anyone."
4,Nice to have on DVD,"This has always been one of the ""classic"" aviation films and it is nice to finally have it on DVD. The story, narration, interviews and cinematography are all excellent. (Leslie Nielsen is the narrator). It was filmed during the 1971 airshow season and covers all the bases. That being said, the video is quite poor. The picture is very grainy and the colors are not at all vivid or crisp. It appears that it is simply a straight transfer from a VHS tape. Too bad the effort was not made to make an HD transfer from an original 16mm film copy..."
5,"Nice, easy patterns!",Great book full of easy patterns and simple instructions. Good book for beginners who want to learn to sew Barbie clothes.
4,The Hip.. production value to match songwriting value,"I am NOT a die-hard Hip fan.For the most part, I have liked them, enjoyed the singles, but not been a ""rush out and buy it immediately"" kinda fan.""In Violet Light"" marks an important step for the Trag... finally, the acoustic properties of the album can keep up to the material. After hearing the single, and the quality of it, I DID rush out and buy it.The best sounding Hip album ever, and the songs contained within are also some of the best material they have produced in some time.I agree with those that say that the Hip are leaning on their past for this one- the guitars and vocals are highly reminiscent of very early Hip, but the experience they have gained in between shines brightly through.I am a converted, newly affected, Hip fan, now.If you love good music, especially when it sounds great, then whether or not you are a huge Hip fan, go get this... the production is brilliant.Way to go, boys."
3,Not their best,"Was somewhat disappointed. Previous albums much better. Favorites of mine are Phantom Power, Trouble at the Henhouse and Music at Work (yes, prefer the newer stuff vs. the old). This album lacked both the instrumental and lyrical pizazz that other TH albums emit. Songs were repetitive and lack luster. Hoping for a comeback on next release."
3,better to have been hip than not hip at all....,"<heavy sigh>i _was_ such a huge hip fan.up to here, road apples, fully completely, day for night, ichallenge any group to string together four better albums ina row.alas those times are over. oh tragically hip of the pastwhere did you go? (i know, i know, all artists must grow musically)anyway enough eulogizing.this is the best hip album in a long time, but not on parwith the above four albums.it does seem to get better with each listen, i can almost seegord clutching the mic stand, convulsing to the rhythm of the darkest one as i listen to it now.oh, go ahead, hip fans young and old, indulge, buy it."
5,They ARE Canada,"I have been a huge fan of The Hip since 1998's Phantom Power, arguably one of the best folk-rock albums ever made.I wasn't very impressed at first, but then again, it's very hard to love this album on a first listen.Good Life, The Darkest One, Silver Jet and Throwing Off Glass are the songs that sell this album for me. Good Life is quiet, morose and stirring. Silver Jet is going to be one of their biggest hits of all time, just you watch. Great screeching guitar riffs from Rob Baker here. Throwing Off Glass is a beautiful song that turns a menail moment between father and daughter into a fantastic songs about a parent realizing his little girl is all grown up.The Darkest One feels like a Phantom Power song. It dances on the line between folk and country, and is a physical manifestation of what Canada is all about in my mind.While there are a few songs that aren't anything special (Are You Ready, All Tore Up), they are still good in their own merits."
3,Never Stray from Center,"Although I've been an avid hip fan since the late 80's, attended every concert - i even went to MLG to see them open for Rush in '92 (and i don't even like Rush) - i have to say i'm a little disappointed on the Hip's reliance on the same old formula.Since Fully Completely the band has essentially released one large album in 5 sections. Thankfully I enjoy their music, however i find i'm opening the new releases with less and less enthusiasm knowing what the product is going to be. The days of lining up in the Kingston rain at midnight to buy the new album are long gone.Other than being musical royalty in Canada - i couldn't separate the hip from any one of 10 other bands. I just hope the next album (which i will buy) offers up something that differentiates the Hip from mainstream music."
5,Got me totally hooked,"If there ever was an album that could get you hooked on a band, 'In Violet Light' is that album. The lyrics are straightforward, yet laden with double-entendre and deeper meaning. A true poetic achievement from Gordon Downie. (I believe there is even a lyric/poem book published for this album.) A group of us even presented a rendition of ""Its a Good Life if You Don't Weaken"" at our summer camp as a tribute to a staff member who was diagnosed with cancer, but continued to work the summer. Truly powerful stuff in here!This is not to say, though, that there are not upbeat, fun tunes that are infused with pure energy and excitement (""All Tore Up"", ""Are You Ready""). The wordsmithing in some of these songs is really great also."
5,lives up to the TH's best,"The TH manages to cover new ground without losing their foundation... words cannot describe the transcendent moments on several songs (even though I think Downie's voice is, unfortunately, starting to decline... more support is needed)."
5,Worked perfectly!,Attached the verticle kayak carrier using these to connect to my Subaru Outback OEM racks and they worked perfectly. Carried two kayaks over 1200 miles with no problems.
1,Suburban 2001 Factory Rack,Does not fit my Chevy 2001 Suburban factory rack. This does not fit all factory racks as it suggests. Had to order the universal mighty mount instead.
5,Messy but Awesome...,"There is going to be a lot of grit in the floor but.... If you put a rug with a lot of pile in the nap, it will remove it from the toes. The little is VERY MUCH worth the purchase as it will dry out a turd in 3 minutes, lol - and seriously he was in the vet for over a week with a HORRIBLE kidney / bladder infection... this littler he really likes it, and it lets me see the exact color of his urine, and there are NO SMELLS. LOVE IT, and I am over ONE MONTH now with the one bag. Follow the instructions and all is good."
2,Buyer Beware,"Good morning. I bought this cat litter for my senior male cat to cut down on UTI infections and because of the added attractant. My cat did not like it. My guess is the litter was too grainy and it irritated his paws. His solution was to avoid it. He urinated on my carpet instead of the litter box. I am sure this product is a blessing to many other senior cat owners, but for me it was a big smelly mess. Once I switched back to his regular Arm and Hammer litter, he was fine. No more mess!"
2,"Saturates quickly, then stinks","This stuff was great for the first day, OK on the second day, and stank horribly on the third day. I did stir/rake the crystals several times a day as instructed. I have 3 cats and there are 2 boxes but they tend to use one for urine and one for feces. They are all on wet food only and urine volume is fairly high but none of them have kidney disease or diabetes so there are no ""special needs"". When I emptied the box today I could see all the crystals were saturated and there was pee all over the bottom of the box. Yuck! I'm going back to World's Best Cat Litter. I have this 2 starts instead of 1 because perhaps for 1 small cat it would be OK. But they are marketing it as ""senior"" cat litter for diabetics and kidney failure cats, who are going to be urinating 3-4 times as much as healthy cats like mine!"
3,Lightweight Fluff,"This is a specialized product for older cats & their urinary tract health. I had bought a bag to try out on my two 6 year old cats as it was a good buy and wanted to see if it was something they would like. I did not follow any special instructions on introducing this into their boxes, I just filled up one of their sand boxes. After a week of no use, I bagged it back up and gave it away. Maybe I could have used it to add to the other litter I had, but didn't want to take the chance of the cats not wanting to use it again.If you do have an older cat with urinary health on the agenda, I would try a bag. This is nothing like any clay type material, it is lightweight fluff. My cats are use to the more clay like Dr. Elsey cat litters."
4,"Offers some insight, but not a lot about writing","Conservative author Thomas Sowell writes in this small volume a little about what it's like to be a writer. He talks about his many battles with editors and his long struggle before he made it in the writing field. However, he barely mentions the art of writing. Really, his only advice is to use simple language, and to keep to a minimum number of words. Those are just basics to writing.His philosophy towards writing is you need to be a bad writer for a while before you become a decent one, which is true, but there are ways to make one's writing better.However, Mr. Sowell's personal history, his humor, and his criteria for citing sources makes this worth the price of admission. But keep other expectations low, and remember that this book is only about 20 pages."
4,Inspiring,This book of poems catches you inside out. Some of my favorites are Dreams and Morning and some others. It is simplistic and it catches the truth in certain aspects of the poems. Read it and you'll know what i mean.
2,Didn't last but 6 months,I put these in and within 6 months 1 of the bright filaments burned out. Normally I wouldn't be bothered by a bulb burning out except I also bought same brand fog light bulbs and both those burned out previous to this burning out. Replaced all the bulbs with the stock bulbs that are still working in a 2007 auto. I will not be buying these again.
4,"Absolutely untrendy, but good!","I think this is Saga's most enjoyable and consistent '90s-album. In the '80s I thought of them a bit as a boring Rush rip-off, but now I appreciate their record output. Rush have become lame and complacent rock dinosaurs, while Saga are still around. They're gonna have a German concert tour in the autumn this year! ""The security.."" is a surprisingly diverse and lively collection of songs. ""Mind over Matter"" is one of my Saga favourites, it has an aggressive guitar drive and shows that Saga are a virtuos and still underrated band. The problem with this record is, that it was released ten years too late. This sound is reminiscent of the early '80s, especially Michael's vocal articulation and phrasing. But if you like '80s rock, ""The security.."" is made for you."
3,Not for those really sticky problems,"This book is excellent if what you need is a compendium of standard features of & options for Windows XP. If, however, you're already thuroughly familiar with Win XP, and are seeking help with those odd issues (e.g. how to automatically sync Outlook Contacts across all user accounts on a one PC or on a single LAN), you will, alas, not find that in this book."
4,Windows XP,This resource provides many advantages to dealing with the details of using Windows XP. I hope this will be the last version of windows I'll need to use.
5,microsoft windows xp professional resource kit second edition,"merchant did all they promised, I just ordered wrong book"
5,Great stuff,This litter is brilliant. It covers smells beautifully and my kitten took to it immediately. Plus nothing sticks to his fur and it only tracks a little.
5,this is the best case period,"I get very dirty & oil covered on a usual day,this case keeps my cigarettes clean & dry & keeps the moisture in so they don't dry out, the case holds up to 21, 10mm diameter king size Cigarettes. I used to waste at least 2 pks a day due to oil spills not anymore love this lil case. Best purchase I've ever made for the money I've saved."
1,Waste of money,If all you want to see in a video is naked women posing then this is it for you. I felt it sucked only watched a third of it and threw it away. Not worth saving.
1,"Pedantic Sex, Muddy Prose","When I ordered this book I had the callow notion that it would be readable. Unfortunately, the author has nibbled a little California theory-cheese and learned to blur all he does so that the dim, who always mistake obscurity for profundity, will be too overawed to notice the fact that what he's written is actually the ultimate eighties cliche: high-culture soft porn, rather like a Greenaway film in print form, overwritten sex and ponderous scenery. Many a belated Lacanian provincial will wriggle excitedly, awed by the very muddiness and sloth of High's grand paragraphs."
4,Superb reference for WW2 modellers and figure painters,"This is an omnibus collection of two books: Army Uniforms of World War 2 and Army Uniforms Since 1945.The first book is an excellent reference for WW2 enthusiasts, especially modellers and figure painters. It contains complete uniform, equipment and weapons information for most army arms.This is an army uniform book. It does not touch naval or air corps uniforms at all.The uniforms and equipment are shown in colour plates, the weapons in B&W.The second book only covers world army uniforms up to the early eighties (Zimbabwe is still Rhodesia), but it covers cold-war uniforms extremely well.Well worth it if you can find it."
4,Great bag!,i love this bag its the perfect size and i can't wait to use it in college. It holds all of my computer accessories as well as a couple notebooks and pens. I was worried at first it wouldn't be big enough but it was much bigger in person than i expected! the color inside makes it very easy to find things inside like other reviewers have said and i would highly recommend this product to anyone!
4,Laptop Bag,The bag is great. The colored interior is very helpful in finding your stuff. Lots of little pockets to help stay organized.
2,"Compared to the originals, a disappointment","I don't have the book any more so don't recall the political bias, but I definitely remember it was NOT as appealing as the three original editions from the late 1970s and early 1980s."
1,disappointment,"great deal of dialogue, very little, if any, in the way of graphical content to illustrate the topic in a dynamic, meaningful way. the cover of the DVD is misleading, a promise of erotica that isn't delivered"
1,Terrible,"Terrible acting, terrible writting, terrible movie. Took me 3 days just to get through it. Got someone you want to punish? Refer them to this movie."
1,Just lame,"Dry acting, poor editing, and not enough sexual content that I expected. For those that wanted to see a more cuckhold experience this is NOT the movie for you. It even has a lame ending. Its a perfect example on how the previews made the movie look so much more than it really is, unfortantly i was suckered by the preview."
1,Chocolate flavored horse dung,"This film simply perpetuates the myth of black penis. It is designed to entertain black men with white woman fetishes. Rotten performances by amatures with little or no stage time. The production is mild porn and the reason no major studio or retailer handles it is because it is so badly made. Caveate emptor, Mo Fo."
3,Would Be Better If...,"The lame ""spooky"" dialogue was left out. It was almost like it was trying too hard to be dark and scary. The music was brilliant but the ridiculous narrative was too much. I was rolling my eyes and thinking, ""Oh, God...""My favorite tracks on this album are ""Let the Pain Begin"" (which is an awesome rock-opera style song) and ""Tubular Hell"" (a rock rendition of Mike Oldfield's ""Tubular Bells"").I have a few songs on my iPod, but used WavePad to edit out the awful story dialogue.3 out of 5."
5,Wonderful CD!,"This CD is amazing! I checked out the sampler, bought it because the price was more than right and I found that the WHOLE CD is great!Christmas classics swingingly done for everyone - teenagers and adults. An amazing buy - don't let the price fool you, this is quality stuff! Great swing, put it on your list for the holidays."
3,"Professional Session Musician's ""Swing 'n Jive""","Solid professional not so much ""jumping jive"" swing - solid session musicians or a solid band you'd hire for a Christmas party. It's not really jive or swinging unless you've never heard jump swing jazz before or you think the local Holiday Inn band really rocks and swings. Basically musician hitting all the right notes and playing all the right notes as they are paid to do but NOT one bit of extra effort or soul. Not dull but essentially souless - it is what it is and as long as the disc is still selling for less than $4 - you get ""lively"" background music but not one ounce of extra effort not paid for by the record label."
4,Wonderful Waldorf recipes and history.,"This book is a fascinating account of the history of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel that leaves you wanting more... food that is! While the recipes are not for the novice, they give you very close reproductions of the food that we have come to love at this wonderful old hotel!"
2,pretty pictures/fussy recipes,"This book would look nice on a coffee table but I think it would be of little use to the home cook. Some of the measurements are just plain silly. For example 1 cup plus 1/4 teaspoon cornmeal for cornbread; one recipie with no reason at all for three different kinds of oils, another time a recipe requests 3 teaspoons of an ingredient (1 tablespoon?) The recipes are full of such foolishness. Probably more important almost all of the recipes are too elaborate: consisting of far too many ingredients which result in over-the top baroque combinations. The attempt to be ""original"" clearly trumps the desire to be sensible. The text about the hotel is mainly self-laudatory..lists of names of famous guests. Clearly not worth the very high price."
3,The big White Lie-Michael Levine,A tawdry tale of corruption and lies by authorities supposed to be controlling the drug trade- expediency rules here. If you accept half of what is written as fact the CIA and the FBI hace a lot to answer for
3,Frenetic and depressing.,"Repetitive and ultimately sadly boring. The editor should have caught ""...I slept good..."" and ""marquis"" for a hotel's marquee.The constant use of Spanish without translation was a royal pain in the tuchas."
4,A true American hero.,"I rank this book with ""Dark Alliance"" and ""C.I.A.: Cocaine In America"" as the most telling indictment of America's pseudo-war on drugs. Unlike most suthors who pontificate solutions from ivory towers and exhort stratagem with quill pens, Mr. Levine, not unlike Mr. VesBucci, for that matter, advises from hard-fought experience."
5,A Man Among Men,"I dont think I would be priviliged enough to be in the same room as this superhero. No need for reviews as the others did a pretty good job. After you read this, you will never trust the government again.He deserves 10 stars."
5,a cant put it down epic novel,"there arent even enough stars to rate how good this book is,,,i recommend starting it early in the day,,,,,,because once you start this roller coaster ride,,its very hard to put down,,,Mike Wallace once refered to Mike Levine as Americas top undercover agent,,,,and,,,,,he was right,,,when i read this book the first time so many years ago,,,,i couldnt understand how the media completely ignored the bolivian cocaine coup..or more important,,,why....in fact,,,i never even heard of this event till i saw it in Mikes book,,a little research proved this to be real fact,,,,in light of what i see now with the media,,,i understand why,,,,the style of writing in this book,,puts you right in the middle of the action,,,i felt like i was standing right there while it was happening,,,this is one of those books,,that when you get near the end,,you wish there was another 1000 pages,,its that good!!!!"
5,A True Crime Must Read,"Levine was a brilliant case study for me as I learned early in my law enforcement career to be an undercover operator. His sheer tenacity and will to persevere for good is an essential element for all. This Kindle version of the great book ""The Big White Lie"" now allows for more Americans to gain a perspective on what happens behind the scenes; pulling back the curtains to expose what has been a facade we call the War on Drugs. This stranger than fiction account of Levine's undercover odyssey is a fascinating and truly eye-opening read, crossing the lines of standard book genres and time. I strongly recommend this great book."
2,Just Hype,I have not noticed a significant decrease in the appearance of cellulite on the front of my thighs. I only purhcased the product for that reason and I've been using it for approx a month and the bottle is almost empty and I don't think it's worth another try. I'll stick to the less expensive Nivea shaping cream!
4,It's working,"I have been using this for 2 weeks. Started using just a sample packet, then decided to buy. I am thin but still have cellulite on backs of thighs that won't go away with exercise- and I work out 45 minutes to 1 hour every day. After 2 weeks I can see a difference in the dimpled skin. When I put it on I can feel the area get a bit warmer. I use it 2 times a day. The only complaints I have is that it keeps me awake at night if I use it too late (the active ingredient was originally used to treat asthma and can have an effect on adrenal function) and it's a bit expensive."
1,No effect what so ever,"I am a skinny person. I only weight 100 lbs, yet I have some cellulite on the back of my thighs. I also have some on my buttocks (when I squeeze them).I've been using Celluthin for over a month now and I havent noticed any changes.I am very dissapointed. :("
2,Not a Miracle.,"Well, I was very excited to use this after reading some of the reviews. I thought it was going to be a miracle cream. I was wrong. Some people said that you can feel it working when you put it on. Well, I didnt feel it working at all. I used it for a month and no huge sign of improvement. It may tighten you up a little, but not near enough to really make a difference. So, save your money. Nothing can ""cure"" cellulite anyway."
4,cellulite works,"I have been using the cream for several weeks and even if it was not much what I wanted to lose, I believe there's been some fat reduction in the abdominal area, I might use it again. Of course exercising is a must, if you do nothing but using the cream do not expect miracles... you need to burn some fats doing something!"
4,Goodbye cellulite!,I am totally doing everything I humanly possibly can to get into tip top physical shaped. (like I used to be before the birth of my daughter)I not only started a strict diet and exercise plan but also started using celluthin as a topical fat burner. I can't say I owe these dramatic results to just one of the weight loss factors I have started but whatever the case may be I am seeing serious results as far as the cellulite is concerned. I believe in the whole topical fat burning theory because exercise alone won't get to the fat that is just beneath the skin if you are a heavy person. Or if you are not a heavy person and have cellulite it could be effective for you as well. I am happy with celluthin and really recommend it.
3,Celluthin review,"I have a gross amount of cellulite on my thighs and buttocks. Although I have been applying this cream as recommended, I can't tell if it is working or not. I also lost a significant amount of weight which left me with lose skin. I don't think anything but plastic surgery will help with that. But as far as the cream is concerned it goes on easily and smells nice. The only area I can see any sort of difference is my buttocks. They look smoother. I will keep using it."
4,"Great service, good product","The delivery time was very good. The price was good. The product is good but leaves a little residue on top (does not rub in completely). So far it has not stained or caused any problems, though. Overall, I rate it very good."
2,Ancient sound quality,"Although the artists and craftsmanship is superb, it is difficult to listen to compared to today's sound quality."
1,Horrible Recording Quality,Borrowed this from the Library. The sound quality was horrible! Noticable clipping and distortion in the first 10 seconds made this CD unlistenable. I took it out and put it right back in the case and took it right back to the library.
1,Waste of Money,"This pen is an absolute waste of money. It just does not work. I was trying to scan in some addresses and phone numbers but what scanned in was nothing but rubbish. For example, I scanned in a phone number which was 956-7535, but what the pen picked up was 9:5&T585. IT DOES NOT WORK. The OCR technology is not there. Don't buy this. You won't be able to get your money back. They'll just do an exchange for another pen that does not work."
2,poor technical support,"I bought the pen because I wanted to capture references and quotations from books and articles.Unfortunately, I was not able to get the pen to communicate with the PC. The tech support person (who claimed to be the only one in Canada and North America) was reluctantly helpful. He helped me figure out the basic settings on the baud rate and the COM ports. But could not help in figuring out why the PC is not connecting to the pen. His suggestion was to re-install Windows!The conflict of new hardware with the the COM ports is a common occurrence. If this is the case, I'm not sure why Wizcom has not created an online helpfile. If you happen to get an error message and do not know out how to resolve (hardware) conflicts on your COM port, this pen will be worthless.The scanning is also difficult and requires practice.I am disappointed that the pen didn't work for me."
1,cannot establish pc to pen connection,"Despite following the step by step procedure to download the dictionary from my pc, a message ""cannot establish connection"" is always prompted in the pen. I read from one review that a cable adaptor was required which they purchased seperately. Could this be the same problem I am facing? If so, why did they not mention it anywhere in the book or in their ads? I would greately appreciate some help or advice here."
1,Systane,"This product did nothing for me. Used it all up, had no effect on my dry eye problem. I do not recommend it."
1,Not the Best,"I bought these drops because there was a review stating that these eye drops were the best, they are not. I been using them for a while now, and my vision got worse. The review stated that these drops helped reverse problems and brought the persons vision back to 20/20, well now my vision is worse no thanks to that review. I did more research and found that the best drops containing sterile saline. Here is a link to better understand. [...]."
3,NOT QUITE WHAT I WANTED,"Unfortunately, I was looking for an edition with the new test which this was not."
3,Actually 3.5 Stars,"Of the two released discs, I ended up preferring Come Feel Me Tremble over this disc. CFMT was 3 stars upon first listen growing to the 5 that I ended up rating it. Dead Man Shake was only 2 stars the first time through it. I thought that this was blues done Westerberg style but not very true to the form. I am big fan of the blues and just couldn't get into this initially. I thought it was good enough to play while driving long distances. After I listening to this disc a few more times it grew on me...maybe only to the 3.5 rating. The reason for the low rating is that I could enjoy blues styling by far more worthy players, doing this musical genre in a more complete way. As I listened more I began to enjoy the Westerberg in this recording, rather than the material. Fans of Paul should purchase this...it still beats the hell out of Don't Tell a Soul late 80's Replacement period. Fans of the blues should go out and buy something else."
3,bluesy experiment,"Westerberg's alter ego plays the blues on this record. There are abouthalf originals and half traditional blues covers. You can hear typicalPaul hidden in these minimalist blues tracks, but if you are looking forReplacements style songs or even Paul solo stuff - this is not what youwill get. I suppose one of the great songwriters of our time canindulge himself now and then... but I would say this record is fordiehard fans only. It seems like Paul got into a blues kick forawhile and decided to record some of it. Just about any record he evermade is better than this, so until you have them all - dont buy thismediocre mess. However, that being said there are some good tracks onthis record. Heck, even bad Paul is better than most artists out there."
4,Diversity,"A nice little nugget of different styles from Paul W. R&B,country and western(love Souvenirs)a few other ditties that show his diversity. If you loved Stereo and Mono. Check this out."
5,Ragged but just right,"If you are a blues purist, or prefer clean, fluid, Clapton-like blues guitar, look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you loved the 'Mats at their peak, or wonder what the Stones might sound like coming in after an all-nighter, plugging in, turning the tape machine on, and letting loose, then ""Dead Man Shake"" is for you. I definitely fit into the latter category, and this to me is ragged, bluesy rock'n'roll that is a whole lot of fun. The drunken-sounding rendition of ""I'm so Lonesome I Could Cry"" is worth the price of admission by itself. Get it and turn it up!"
5,Some Good Gear!!,"I think this thing is awesome! I haven't field tested it yet, but I have no doubts that this thing will serve its purpose. If/When you buy, make sure you have a funnel to fill it. That is the mistake I made, but I won't deduct any stars for my own faults. Well worth it, I expect to be using this thing in several years."
5,can't wait to try it,very quick turn around time on the shipping and the seller responded right away to my questions.with all the luck everyone has been having i can't wait to cruise this weekend and see how well it works! but i am sure it will work just fine!
5,Jaton Wincomm II modem,"Having gone through Winmodem hell using a number of inexpensive V90 modems I happened to try one of Jatons Wincomm II modems.I had an effortless installation and the product connected well, usually at 49,333 0r 50,666kbps. I have been using these modems now for over 2 years and have installed 12 of them in different systems. EVERY installation went flawlessly and everyone I have installed them for has been happy with their stability and performance. I think this is the BEST Winmodem available at any price."
3,Breakthrough,All the reviews except one seems to be for a Richard Burton movie by the same name. If you are going to review a movie make sure its the right movie with the right cast. I haven't seen the movies in years but as far as I remember it was a pretty good 1950's movie concerning WWII and Frank Lovejoy as the Platoon sergeant and David Brin as the company commander were excellent and John Agar as the platoon Leader was John Agar
5,Decent war movie,Saw this movie being shown on TCM so I bought it and was able to watch the entire movie. Decent war movie with alot of fighting scenes.
2,A mediocre movie with a terrible soundtrack,"""Breakthrough"" is an absurd copy of the excellent Sam Peckinpah's movie ""Cross of Iron"". It lacks from this standpoint originality (even the names of the characters are the same with a different story this time in the western European theather). The recreation of war scenes are fairly good (American tanks are from the Korean War though) and probably the element that barely saves the movie is the fine recreation of German uniforms (for those lovers of german WWII millitaria). The film has a soundtrack that not matches the movie at all. Even with actors of the caliber of Richard Burton, Robert Mitchum, and Kurt Jurgens, ""Breakthrough"" is undoubtly a mediocre war movie."
4,A very different Regency; maybe more true to the period,"Yes, a very likeable book, though if you're looking for debutantes, balls and aristocrats you won't get them. A well-crafted love story.I think I still prefer 'Mrs Drew Plays Her Hand,' though."
3,Father-Daughter love,"I am an ""enjoy the ride"" romance reader. Like, who can't enjoy the ride in Pride and Prejuice? I am not overly critical of most romances novels, but this one was a too convoluted. I thought the Earl had a more ""protective of his daughter"" type of love. She had moments of level headness and maturity, but she also displayed too much flighty teenager type of behavior to be considered a true romantice equal of the Earl. It was a quick clean romance read, but lacked a lot of good litereary qualities."
3,Not her best but not her worse,"I felt there were some emotional holes here and there, but it was a good read over all and unique in its story line."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money On This Book!,"Written with all the analytical skill and literary style of a pre-schooler, this skimpy book sheds no light nor heat on the disappearance of Madalyn Murray O'Hair. One day a real biography or investigative book will explore her murder, but this hack offers nothing."
1,Very disappointed,"This camera was not very good at all. I received this camera for Christmas from my boyfriend. He didn't buy the memory card that goes along with it. I'm sure that is a huge factor why it isn't very good. I could only take 20 pictures and then the memory is full. I received the camera on December 24th and had to change the batteries twice and I've only had the camera for five days. Vivitar is not a good brand at all, I would go with a Cannon. I have heard nothing but good things about those cameras."
4,Excellent Easy Camera,This camera is one of the easiest camera's to use. I have done some amazing photos already with this camera. The night shots I've taken of turn out amazing with all the exposure settings that you have to choose from (tripod will be needed for pictures of christmas lights for example). Compact enough camera fits in a pocket. Takes crisp clear shots on the superfine settings. Easy download. Just an excellent camera for anyone wanting to get started in digital imaging. A lot of features for the price.
1,I hated it,"I bought this for my birthday, and it wouldn't even turn on. I would highly reccommend not buying it."
1,Useless,"I started with Alkaline batteries and they were dead after a few minutes of camera use. I bought rechargables and those lasted no longer. Besides, the need for reprogramming (see other reviews) is a pain. Furthermore, there is no way to completely disable the video function and frequently I was accidentally shooting video instead of still shots. The only use I have for this camera is with an A/C adapter which I bought to take pictures for Ebay listings. The camera has proven useful for that."
4,More than satisfied,"I can't compare this Vivitar camera to any others on the market because it's the first digital camera I've had, but I am more than satisfied with the purchase. For the price, it's a steal. It's simple to operate, and the resulting pictures are clear, crisp, and surprisingly large. The software packaged with it makes it an even more worthwhile buy. You can edit, resize, and get creative with your photos without having to buy a lot of other expensive software. Uploading photos to your computer can be accomplished with a minimum of fuss.The only complaint I have is one voiced by others: this baby eats up batteries. But if you pick your subjects wisely and avoid the temptation to snap away with reckless abandon, this is a great camera for the price.Brian W. Fairbanks"
3,Not such a hot deal,I bought this camera because I wanted a 3MP digital camera and I am very disappointed. The pictures are not good quality and there is a HUGE lag time for the camera to focus. I bought these as Christmas gifts for family and I am going to advise them to return them and get something else.
2,Purchase something else,"I've owned and used this camera for almost 8 months, since Christmas 2003. I liked it at first, as it was easy to use and operate. It became quickly apparent, though, that it sucks batteries dry at the speed of light. Whenever I changed the batteries--which was often, 99% of the time I also had to reprogram the camera--a huge pain if you want to catch a particular moment. The 3x digital zoom zooms to 3x, there is no in-between, no control at all over the zoom. Over the last month, the zoom has worked sporadically--not working when I wanted and needed it the most. The picture quality is good, what you would expect, I think, from a 3.3 MP camera. But, overall, I wish I could get my money back."
1,Piece of Junk,This camera is a piece. I have had problems with it every since I have gotten it for christmas. I was going to return it but My spouse thought he may know what the problem was. I can take approximately 8 pictures and the batteries are dead. Then even with new batteries it shuts off right when it comes on. I don't recommend this camera to anyone.
2,Eats up batteries like no camera I've ever seen,"Regardless of the fact that this camera takes great pictures, it really eats up batteries easily. NiMH's last longer than regular batteries, but still not long enough in my opinion. I'd suggest forking over an extra $50 to get a better camera!"
4,"Very good, durable camera","This camera served me well in the time i used it. I took some great pictures with it on a camping trip i took. The flash is really good but uses up batteries faster than you would like so its good to have rechargeable batteries. Once you have those though, this camera is excellent."
4,ViviCam 3705 Camera a great deal,VIVITAR ViviCam 3705 3.3MP Digital CameraThis camera works great for someone who takes simple pictures. It takes great outdoor camera without touch up needs. Indoor shots sometimes need touch up depending on lighting in the room.It uses batteries and works best with rechargeabel AA batteries.
3,"beautiful visuals, disjointed story","this is a gorgeous movie to watch. it's just about the right length, has excellent audio and graphical productions, solid voice acting, a nice mix of CGI and traditional animation and excellent mecha designs, the best I've ever seen.The downside is the storyline. even if you've watched the first series, the motivations of the characters seem rushed and confused. The random addition of characters from the first series gives the movie that disjointed feel, so you never get the sense of watching a cohorent story. It's like the producers did the plot last.I would recommend this if and only if you want to SEE a high end anime movie and don't care much for anything like plot, or storyline or character development"
5,not a anime sequel but a manga sequel!,"I know alot of people hav critisized this movie saying it is much darker than the anime and has hardly any humor, well there is a reason for that..... The Prince of darkness finishes up the manga not the anime. The manga was a much darker and different expirence than the anime ad the movie continues that so give it a chance it really is good when you think about it."
3,Tripled the Price,These are nice pens but not at triple the price they were 6 months ago. Please reconcider pricing and an extra photo with a description of how many per case would help.
3,Pages ripped,"One back page was completely ripped off while two of the pages with images on them have rips down the center. The book itself is a wonderful book full of Degas sketches and drawings, however without any descriptions or explanations. But the seller never mentioned any rips and, as a matter of fact, said the book was in very good condition. I feel a bit ""ripped off""."
1,The dog did not like it either,"This is nutritionally a good product, but taste wise, close to cardboard. The beans stay hard and the noodles are almost not edible. It failed the taste test from two human adults and one usually hungry eats anything puppy. The puppy left it an went for kibble instead.I purchased it as part of several soups from that company. I do like the potato leek, but not this one!"
1,My least favorite Nile Spice product,"I accidentally ordered this, Minestrone Soup, instead of Nile Spice's Minestrone Couscous. Two very different products indeed!This one, the soup, seemed salty and watery tasting to me. The beans are VERY hard, and don't seem to cook well. I think that beans probably should be soaked and then cooked to taste right. Nile Spice has many other products that are healthier and tastier this one."
1,Try something else,"In comparison to other soups, Nile Spice is extremely salty. The problem with this soup is that the beans are not cooked properly. Skip it."
4,Good soup,This is pretty good for an instant healthy lunch. Reasonably priced. The soup has a delicious taste and is a reasonable serving.
4,"Just ""Very Good"" , not Perfect!","I have been buying alot of astronomy and telescope books of late--primarily to augment my new telescope. This is one of the better ones , since it is really much more substantive than the ""cheerleading"" books that are more useful at gracing the coffee table than the accessory tray of a telescope in use. The major plus feature for me is the format of the illustrations , which show the objects through a mirror type diagonal. Most , if not all , observations by amateur astronomers use this convention these days. The author goes into adequate detail on double star observing : measurement of position angle and seperation are very well explained.My only criticism is the assumption that all users will be using computerized telescopes , and completely ignores those of us who ""star hop"" by choice , and not necessity. The lack of star hopping descriptions downgrades my rating to a strong 4 stars.Highly recommended."
3,Impressive!,An interesting character study in human nature. The author's concept was at once astute and sensitive. He intelligently mixes wit and humor into a situation that is really HEAVY. I look forward to his next endeavor. Well done!
3,Impressive!,An interesting character study in human nature. The author provides an insight that is at once astute and sensitive. Wit and humor are cleverly mixed in to a situation that is so real. I eagerly await his next endeavor. A must read!
4,"Fascinating, Enjoyable, Dramatic","I enjoyed this book. It's an interesting, fast-paced story, despite the peculiar writing style. There were fluctuating POV's (omnipresent, first person, third person) and redundancies. Despite this, it's a good story and the author is a great storyteller. ChocolateSleuth.com recommends this as a great quick read that will have you turning pages until the end.It's the story of Evelyn, a young girl who grew up hard, making mistakes along the way until a life-changing experience--the murder of the father of the baby she carries, leads her to change her life. A colorful cast of well-fleshed characters and snappy dialogue keeps the story moving. I found it hard to put this book down. There is strong violence and sex scenes, so this is not a read for the faint of heart. I'd love to read G. Lawrence's future offerings."
4,It has saved us on several trips,My family and I drive to Minneapolis (5 hours 1 way) and Rochester (7 hours 1 way) several times a month and this unit has worked miracles for us as the kids can watch a DVD or on stuff off the IPOD. We have never had a problem with the unit and recommend it. The only thing I do wish is I could find a way to get a third monitor as it might shut the wife up too..
1,BROKE IN LESS THAN A MONTH,I bought this DVD player less than a month ago and it has already broken. I plan on returnng it to the store where I bought it. I don't think I will get the same player again and will probably try a different brand.I have 3 children and we live quite a distance from anything so they did watch the player about 3 times per week when we went into town. The latch on the player didn't close properly and the screen would say the player was still open unless you applied pressure to hold the lid of the player shut. We are using the #2 player until we can return it to the store for a refund.It really is kind of disapointing. In our old van we had a TV and VCR that was still going strong after 9 years of constant use when we traded it in.
4,From a new perspective,"An enjoyable description of a few of the saints, from modern perspectives. Good bed-time reading, when only a short bit will do. Also, it brings to mind things you might not have thought about for awhile."
3,Why not reissue the original LPs?!,"Universal Music Latino seems to be putting out one greatest hits collection after another on the (now-defunct) TH-Rodven label's former back catalog. Since Olivencia scored some of his greatest successes on TH-Rodven from 1979-90, his many albums should be reissued on CD. This budget-priced CD does not do the artist any justice whatsoever."
1,Misleading,"The picture's are very misleading. You can't see the stone diamonds on top because they are covered with books and candles. Also much darker than in pictures. (Both which were identified by the other review.) Bought the item not knowing this, and was told it would cost over $150 to return. Will never buy from them again. Major disappointment."
2,no no no,"If you like british black pudding do not buy this. It is not like true black pudding as it falls apart as you cook it and, it don't have same taste."
1,Bad meat.,"This arrived at least a week late with no refrigeration. Upon opening the package, I found it was warm and smelled a bit strange. I would have sent it back, but it was stinking up my home and had to be disposed of. As for a refund, I'm still wondering if I want to banter with the monkeys who sent it. It took them long enough."
2,Way Too Much allspice,an overall good pudding spoiled by the use of way too much allspice. The spice overpowers the pudding. It's downright off putting.
5,Comprehensive overview without needless information,"Architecture Today is the best single volume reference I have found to date that covers not only the diversity of current architectural theory and practice but successfully relates the various ""pieces"" into a comprehensive, intelligible whole. Steele deftly handles a complex set of interrelated issues and personalities in a knowing and confident manner without being overwhelming. It was useful for introducing me to less-than-famous architects who none the less are having a profound effect on the built environment. The book really lives up to its title. (The profuse photographs printed on almost photo-grade paper are stunning as well and I'm tempted to buy another copy just to frame the pictures!)"
3,"A bit dated, but intriuging","Midston University, as part of a convention, builds (as suggested by Danny Dunn) a dream future house. Danny, Irene, and Joe check out the house before it opens. The gadgets are interesting, though they don't project how much computers would change things for us all - on that level. Some things in the house aren't quite meant to be (as always, the book shows technology's practical limits), and that's how they get in trouble - locked in because the voice-activated door malfunctions. They use a little ingenuity, though..."
3,bad news,"I was waiting for a new performance of Vangelis. When i got yor advise, i thought ""Let's see what's new"", but the answer was ""bad news"" one more time another compilation of Vangelis. The tracks are wright, but as usual on the last times no new tracks. That's te way I put the 3 stars rate, because there is no new material. In the latest 70's and early 80's Vangelis has veri rich music, but now, he was to live on his past. Bad news for a great musician like him"
5,Enjoyable -- and Readable -- History,"Strauss brings the ancient sources to life with this well researched account of one of the greatest naval battles of all time. The book reads like a novel, with rich color and great details. But Strauss also keeps true to the historical details, with well documented and well reasoned interpretations, an appendix of sources, and a detailed bibliography guaranteed to satisfy even the most finicky reader. The characters and the story are compelling and the story moves at a rapid pace. The author's familiarity not only with Greece's landscape and history, but also with the mechanics of rowing, make this book a treat for historians and athletes alike."
5,Naval Battles Explained,"A brief (for a history text), very readable story centered on the battle of Salamis. Perfect mix of story telling and history name/date with enough details to satisfy but not overwhelm. Not too hardcore with footnotes and readable for the history novice. That said, after reading several more rigorous history texts centered on Greece/Rome from 700 BC-300AD this book fills in the holes regarding naval warfare and strategy."
5,OK I hate the author now,"Barry Struas has ruined other history books for me. Whereas most other authors just blandly list facts with an agenda, some point they are trying to prove this author has no agenda. Instead his approach is very much a man on the street kind of report following one chain of events to its next logical step. One can get a good idea of not only the motivations of the Greeks but also the motivations of the Persians who it turns out weren't such bad soldiers after all.His book on Spartacus is his best but this one about ""How western democracy was saved"" (while paradoxically being the door through which the Athenian Empire was founded) runs a close second."
3,Well worth reading,"First, let me state my caveats as to why I am not giving this book five stars, and get it out of the way. Being a McFarland book, it was never really ""edited,"" resulting in a fair number of typos (the funniest of which involves a theater catering to ""blue color families""). And the author falls prey to--and mentions--every Kenneth Anger-inspired scandal he can squeeze in, even if they have no bearing at all on Carole Landis' life and career. Cary Grant, Grace Kelly, Wallace Beery, Lupe Velez, Virginia Rappe (whom he flat-out calls a ""whore"")--all the old unfounded rumors are here, simply to spice up this book.That being said, this is otherwise an excellent, well-researched bio of a neglected figure. Fleming writes well, and--unlike so many biographers--actually discusses in-depth Landis' films and performances, not settling for just dishing her private life. She was, after all, an actress, and her acting is indeed covered in-depth."
2,"Carole, yes; writing, no","Ms. Landis's story is interesting and sad, human and not very unusual --yet she seems to have been a special person. However, this book is so badly written and awkwardly put together that it's hard to do much more than quickly skim through it only to get the facts."
4,"Good, but also filled with tracks available on other CDs.","This budget-priced CD has some of Paquito's big salsa romantica smash hits and a few boleros but most are available on the ""Oro Salsero 20 Exitos"" double CD (which is a far better choice than this compilation). Honestly, Paquito's entire TH-Rodven back catalog deserves to be reissued on CD."
2,not as well made as the trike,"We purchased the trike and this pull behind cart last year. The trike is great, but I don't recommend the cart. Neither the design nor the quality are very good. Ours require re-drilling because the axle holes didn't match up with those in the deck. Also, the tow bar only extends to the front edge of the cart, so it is very prone to bending when a friend or younger sibling climbs in. I repaired ours by replacing it with a longer bar that extends the full length of the cart."
2,Really cheaply made,"I bought this for my daughter's trike and it's really poorly made. The bottom of the wagon is 1/4"" plywood and the bolts connecting the axles and trailer hitch are cheap and come loose. The trailer hitch part is flat and bends easily. There was also no means to connect the trailer to whatever you want to connect to. I had to buy some hanger clamps at the hardware store to mount on the trike and an eye-bolt to attach the trailer to the hanger clamps. The side panels don't stay on very well and they are really flimsy. Take a pass on this piece of junk."
3,"Slightly Painful, But Works","I was disappointed with these razors, I feel like they feel sharp and slightly dragging on my skin, it is not gliding and soft. I will not be buying Venus again. I think I'll just have to suck it up and buy the men's Quattro razors... (I'm a girl, my fiance uses them) they are crazy expensive, but they feel great!"
2,So small!,"These razors are barely 1.5"" wide & they go dull incredibly quickly. I've had other Venus razors & thought this refill would be just the same as any of their other varieties, alas no. I would never buy them again."
5,Product that lasts a long while,"I have the razor and ran out of razor blades for the razor. I had asked myself what I was going to do to shave? I am very happy with the razor I have, it just needed refills for the razor blades. Looked for the cheapest price online at some stores and they all wanted pretty much $19.99 for 4 refills. Went to Amazon and they had the refills for $8.44. I thought that was a very good price for 8 refills seeing that 4 refills were 19.99. So I purchased 2 packs - that should last me a long time.Starfire"
3,I Hate Being Poor,"I'm spoiled by previous experiences with Venus Embrace (5-blades and a moisture strip... I leg-gasm just thinking about it).Pros:1. Compact. They fit in my travel case better than any of the other Venus blades.2. The moisturizing strip IS sufficient for dry-shaving.3. Has considerable longevity. With intermediate use, one cartridge lasts like 3 weeks.Cons:1. Way too easy to razor burn. I have to be super careful by making short, well lubricated strokes. It's just too much effort.2. Doesn't give a dynamic shave, but that shouldn't be surprising.3. Because of the short, choppy strokes that are necessary because of the blades' epic crappiness, it's too easy to get cut. I'm tired of chopping up my knees and ankles.Moral of the story... BUY VENUS EMBRACE!!! Your legs/the person/people who enjoy them will thank you!"
3,Not as good as they were before,"I switched to the Venus some years ago but, with each successive order, they seem to last a little less long and shave a little less smoothly. I am not sure why. For comparison I borrowed my husband's Gillette Fusion and it was remarkable how different they were. Hmmm. The Fusion is more expensive but I also liked his Mach III better."
3,Does the job,I have always liked this razor but Gillette made the cartridges way too expensive. I've hoped to be more ecologically minded rather than use single use throwaways but these turn out to not be cost effective.
2,Not the best,"The razors are much better than a disposable style, but still not nearly as good as other Gillette razors. The first time I used them they really irritated my skin and even took some skin off my shin. The shave is close, but reeks havoc on my sensitive skin. If you don't get razor burn, buy these, otherwise pay the extra for a better model."
2,Not so great,"Yeah, I'm a guy. Yes, these are chick razors. I shave more than my face though ,and I don't like using the same razor on my body that I use on my face. I decided to give these blades a try because my girlfriend has a Venus razor. Unfortunately these blade suck. They're no different than most higher-end disposables. I though these were the good ones like my girlfriend had, but they're not.My girlfriend has Venus blades that have this thick layer of built in moisturizers that make shaving super easy, even without cream. These blades do not, and they're not worth the price."
1,DULL right out of the box!!!,"I don't know how this can happen, but these blades are DULL! I have used Venus blades for years, and have always been very impressed with how incredibly smooth the shave was! And the blades themselves would last me forever! I have very fine hair to shave, too...so it's never been an issue. But even if I used my prior Venus blades for months and months, the shave was STILL better than these right out of the box! Strange. But I know that I will go back to using the regular old Venus blades instead, and I'm not going to buy them online! (Mine were from BelowCostJML on Amazon.)"
2,Not the best,I went from using a Schick Quattro for a few years or so to this.. and I have to say there's a GIANT difference. I will definitely go back to the Quattro.
5,A thrilling book for kids!!!!!,This book is geat for the whole family. The illitrations are fantastic and funny. It's about Pa who moved to California and sends a note to tell his familly to move to California. They take a stage coach from Missorii to California and it took 21 days to get there. There are funny people in this book. Ma in this book has a secret in the end so read the book to find out. Buy this book for the kids and it will make them smile so much that there smile will stay there. So buy this book right now!!!!!
5,all women considering marriage should see this,"More than just ""pleasant,"" as the previous review suggests, this film with the sexy star of CSI William Petersen, reveals the mature choice women must make in weeding out suitors. Spacek's character must choose between the sexy but problematic ex and the cherishing beau."
4,A Good Movie,"Though this story plays out with awkward intelligence, it is a goodmovie that won't drain you to watch. It's all about one family who sees Sissy Spacek's now ex-husband come back from being out of town for way longer than is acceptible. We learn early in the story that he has a pre teen daughter who adores him. And she has to suffer the same way his wife does because despite good intentions, he can't come back to reclaim what was once his."
5,What is wrong with culture?,"Could someone please explain to me how such a wonderful book can be out of print? what is wrong with culture? The Contrabass is a novella writen by german author Patrick Suskind, yes, the same man who wrote The Perfume. But this time he chose to work with another sense: hearing. And his protagonist is not a killer but a hollow man, a contrabassist (Did I say it well?)the man in the orchestra who hardly will be a soloist. Instead of a decadent city, the whole novella happens in a room, where the contrabassist prepares himself for a concert and tells the reader, or the audience, about his life. This beautiful novella, or is it a play? is a microcosm of the life of a simple man: full of doubts, full of pain, full of solitude. A shame, shame, shame that such a beautiful work about a man whose lifework is music, cant be found for the reader and the musiclover to enjoy"
3,Good Compilation,"The Ritchie Family are one of those groups whose songs you may have probably heard but are unfamiliar with who actually performed them, take The Best Disco in Town, Give Me A Break or African Queens as examples. Its a good compilation including all of their hits as well as some album tracks. Good for dancing and remembering a bygone era."
3,why was this band never a hit in the u.s.?,"there are plenty of bands in the 80's that had their rise to stardom on a single song. this album has at least 3 terrific songs that are still beautiful today. Rain, Cry, and Wilderwood all kick serious butt. For the price they ask for this cd, it's well worth the investment. i'm a tough judge on music. 3 stars is a solid compliment from me."
3,"Confusion, misusage of emotions, already used stories.","When I read this, I was most confused. Some of the stories that she used was also present in 'Possession'. One of them was 'The Glass Coffin', I think that some people will agree with me that this book is obviously just for the sake of publication. It was not the best that I have read by her. The only story that intruigued me was the title of the book, but, certain plots in the story were left hanging and the characters were not as real as the others."
1,I don't get it,"I really don't see the hype behind this collection of so-called fairy tales. I found them tedious, redundant, and shallow."
5,Great stories by a great storyteller,This is a very short short story collection. The title story is a gem. Loved the voice of experience that speaks to all of us women of a certain age. Love is the answer to the partricular questions posed by this enchanting story. I know I am not the only one who would like to partake of the heroine's particular blend of luck and knowledge.
4,"Recycled, But Still Good","It is true that these stories are mostly recycled, but they're still worth reading. The title story alone makes the book worth seeking out. Buy the book for fairy story loving friends who haven't read Possession, or get a blanket and cup of something warm and curl up to read it yourself."
5,WoW Green--a great CD,This is one of the best worship albums I have listened to. I got it the other day and my friend and I just couldn't stop listening to it in the car. It has some old favorites and some new upbeat songs that will get you moving. A definite must have if you love worship music.
1,Skip It!!,"A total waste. Glenn Close was too old, the rest of the cast dull. The one exception is Harry Connick who was ideally cast as Lt. Cable. Even There Is Nothin Like A Dame is wrong, it sounds like boys in a club in Chelsea rather than the rough and tough Seabees and Sailors they are meant to be. Forget it, the entire film is dreary and unmoving and just plain wrong! Get the Carnegie Hall concert version with Reba. THAT is a masterpiece of a performance, and does true justice to this Rodgers and Hammerstein classic."
5,A lovely new version!,"Like the other reviewers, South Pacific is one of my favorite musicals. I have my Mom's record of the original Broadway recording and have enjoyed it almost all my life. I was delighted when I heard about the 2001 version of South Pacific - watched and recorded it and loved every moment! Comparing the previous cast members is like comparing apples to oranges. Enjoy the present cast and their talents! Glenn Close, Rade Sherbedgia, Robert Pastorelli, Harry Connick Jr. - all gave excellent performances. Glenn Close and Rade Sherbedgia were both pleasant surprises for me - I had no idea either one of them could sing. And they both sing very well. Rade Sherbedgia's versions of Some Enchanted Evening and This Nearly was Mine were touching and beautiful. Enjoy the singing and the storyline and the beautiful scenery. A must for Rodgers and Hammerstein fans!"
1,Some shows DO NOT need a revival or a TV version!,"Whoever cast Glenn Close as Nellie Forbush owes her a huge apology because it was nothing short of an act of cruelty. She was wrong, wrong, wrong for the part and she knew it--it shows in her wooden and totally unbelievable performance. This Rodgers and Hammerstein masterpiece did not need a shoddy made-for-TV version--the original movie was perfect and did not need anyone to try and duplicate the magic of it. Most of the soul was sucked out of it in this crappy TV production and equally yucky soundtrack. What an abomination. That whirring sound is Richard and Oscar spinning in their graves."
1,(GLENN) CLOSE TO THE WORST SOUNDTRACK EVER,"She was brilliant as Norma Desmond in Sunset Blvd. As Nellie Forbush, Glenn Close is close to ending her career. The cast recording of the made-for-TV musical---like the movie itself--- lifeless and lackluster, with stars Harry Connick Jr. and Close, especially, sounding very much wilted leis. Some enchanting evening? More like a fatal attraction."
2,Not The Genuine Article,"It would be very easy for me to completely blast this made-for-TV version soundtrack. However, I'm not (completely). True, Glenn Close is too old to play Nellie and Harry Connick Jr. seems oddly out of place in his role as Cable. However Rade Sherbedgia saves the day as Emile. Rade sings with heart, even though his voice is rather weak... kind of like a whisper actually. I was moved by his renditions of Some Enchanted Evening and This Nearly Was Mine. Glenn Close has a decent voice, kinda like Mary Martin's but with an edge. My biggest gripe though is the balance between the singing and accompaniment. The orchestra seems to at times drown out the singers. A better job of mixing was in order. Though this new recording can no way replace the Broadway and movie versions (by a long shot), it is a rather queer addition to have whenever you're in the mood for.... say something different?"
3,Mixed feelings,"If you only want one version of ""South Pacific"", go for the Broadway cast recording. This one has its merits, but it falls short. Glenn Close handles her parts quite well and is the saving grace of this CD. Most other aspects of the recording are disappointing. The worst mistake, I think, was the inclusion of the altered, muted versions of several numbers, including the title theme."
3,Won't go through walls,"This item woorks fine if you're able to aim the remote directly at the unit. I was looking for something that would control my iPod through walls, though; looks like I'll have to keep looking."
3,Poor Dokken,"The albums are great, with having a former Winger guitarist with his ultimate play. However, I did not like the overall sound quality, Don didn't sound too well either with his singing. As for the performance, I think they did a great job! If you are looking into Live gig of Dokken, you might wanna consider checking the old era of Dokken's live album , ""Beast from the East"" which is 10 times better than this one. Plus it was recorded back in 1988, live in Budokan, Japan. George Lynch plays a very technical solos with more adlib play. He is a very admirable guitarists that is always practicing hours and hours on daily basis, and he always have a strong will to learn. Surprisingly, even during a tour concert, he spent hours rehearsing in the backroom coming up with great adlib solos.... which proves in this album. Once again, I would not recommend this if you are looking into hearing the real thing!"
5,A Jewel of a historic Atlas,"What an immense and high quality work! I never saw a comparable one. There are the maps, and in the maps quotations of the diaries of the explorers. You can exactly follow the route in word and maps. And underled the reconstructed maps you can see side for side a modern map, who allows to find your way today. The size of the maps is perfect, also the clear print. Everyone, who is interested in the Lewis and Clark expedition needs this books (vol I and II edited) and for a fruitful scientific work it is simply a must.I can only say: Excellent and congratulations."
4,good cd,my son loves this cd and it has all the wiggles songs he likes. the songs seem kind of short but it's fine because my son still enjoys it.
2,Little disappointed,"It is a large seat that fits my stationary Schwinn exercise bike well, but it is really thin and does really nothing to improve the comfort. Unfortunately it is not worth the shipping charges to send it back but otherwise I would have returned it."
4,As described,"I had a hard time finding a gel seat cover for my beach cruiser. Local stores, like Wal-Mart, only carried regular sized ones. Local bike stores had the right size, but they wanted like $50.This was a much better deal. It was as described and works well."
2,Catch a Call,"I've had two of these, and both were great at first and enabled me to not miss calls, but both stopped working after awhile. Pretty frustrating, as they are not cheap. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but I didn't change any of the connections."
2,Catch-A-Call,"For PC(s) vs. Mac(s). The install CD was cracked beyond usage for anyone. For those on dial up, perfect design and idea."
4,My daughter is singing all the time now,"She begged us for it, we bought it home. And our daughter was singing all the time. All of a sudden she wanted voice lessons. (They are a bit pricey for us with 3 kids) so we bought her some singing lessons on cd- brilliant idea (Voice Lessons To Go by Vaccarino). Now she has picked up my son's guitar and is making up simple songs. We are all ready preparing for the many Karaoke Cds we will be purchasing for Christmas!"
4,Fun and easy.,"Most of the little girls I know love Lizzy McGuire, and it follows that they also love to sing the songs they have heard. This CD has easy to follow lyrics with the rhythm indicated by how long words remain on the screen before changing color. So even if the songs are new, they can learn them.Be age conscious. I wasn't, but I still think this is a great CD for kids because they will continue to listen to the Lizzy McGuire CD's while in the car and then suddenly discover they know the songs when the Karaoke system is set up.I think Karaoke will encourage reading skills, and this makes it fun."
2,Not much content . . .,"I may have given this CD three stars, may-be even four except there's not enough content! There's 16 tracks, but only 8 different songs. And plus I thought there would be songs from the TV series, or may-be even by Hilary Duff (who plays Lizzie McGuire.) But they are all from the movie, so I think they should've called it the Lizzie McGuire MOVIE Karaoke CD. So get the sound track for the movie, or a different Lizzie CD if you are interested. There are some good tracks, I'll admit. And based on my review you'd probably figure I hated the CD, not true! I even listen to it sometimes, but totally not worth what I payed for it."
4,I like it!!!,I think This cd is ok. Some of the songs are old and after you listen to it once you get tired of it i know cause i bought the lizzie mcguire movie soundtrack and i barely listen to it
5,always go for internal TV cards!,"I was reluctant to purchase an internal card, but the Hauppage WinTV DBX was my first choice if ever. I initially got a Pinnacle Studio PCTV USB...and it wasn't any good! The resolution was poor, and the sound had a 'distinctive hum' when increased. Returned it to the seller, and told them I'll exchange it for the WinTV card - and twas a good thing I did have it replaced!! This card has great resolution, and has all i need (video and still capture, input for ext. a/v devices).The DBX sound is great too, and no more 'hums' - plus i got mine with a promotional free IR remote! So now i can chat, surf, and not have to get off my seat to watch (or record) tv! Highly recommended (specially the unit w/ the free remote included). Running the unit on an AMD Athon 1.33GHZ w/ 640MB DDR RAM, and a 64MB nVidia GeForce 2 video card."
3,Good product...not compatible,"Had this product for over a year and it worked great until I installed a Logitech Webcam, and the two devices don't like living together. The Logitech deleted the drivers and software for the Win TV card. I reinstalled the TV card using the newest drivers downloaded from Happauge and it kicked out the webcam. I made the decision that I'd rather have the webcam but Happauge should definetely make a patch so that their products get along with everything else."
4,Good Panic at Great Venue,"This DVD is bittersweet. I love the fact that they are releasing DVD's but its sad not to see Mikey Houser in his spot ripping the Fender. George McConnel tries his best to fit in here but gets upstaged by the Guitarist from the North Mississippi All Stars on the Rolling Stones cover of ""Stop Breaking Down Blues"". This is definately the highlight of the show. You also get some nice sax work by Randall Bramlett who has played with everyone to help fill the void of Mikey. Other highlights include the ""Rock"" with great slide work by John Bell. ""Picken up the Pieces"" lets Randall stretch out. JB does Cat Stevens well by covering his easy to relate to ""Trouble"". The bonus on the DVD are ok but its all about the music. The true bonus is they released this in DTS audio format."
3,average,"I went to the well one too many times with wide spread panic this time.It's not bad but not in the same class as ""light fuse"", ""uber cobra"" or the 3 disc ""live in the classic city""."
4,too much rethoric about free market,"this is very interesting book providing a huge amount of useful data about different health systems in the world, although the presentation is scattered, irregular and according to the Authors` design, more than to a planned and rational description. Their interpretation of the data provided is not always acceptable. They use the old tactic of attributing something false to the enemy to attack it. They create a ""myth"" about national health sysems whcih nobody ever stated or believed and they used it to show the weakness of NHS. After completing the book I was even more convinced of the benefit of health systems such as those existing in Europe and in canada compared to the US. Their critique by the Authors might indeed be useful in spotting their limitations ( obody says they are perfect) and correcting them"
3,OK,"We put these on a kit used in a Church that uses a plexi-glass drum surround. They sound great in a large room, really great. Then you put the kit in essentially a broom closet and they are terrible. To much overtone from the hydraulic design that makes them sound great in a big room. Like I said get what suits you. If your playing in a large room -get heads for that and if your playing in an enclosure -get heads that are pretty dry. You can add effects to the kit through the PA if needed. Same for cymbals actually. You can get away with garbage cymbals for your kit if they are in an enclosure and they'll sound fantastic."
5,AMAZING!!!,"I didn't think that they could come up with a better cd than the first, but they did. De Viaje is unbelievably phenomenal. I think it will win many, many awards and I would recommend it to everybody, even if you don't fully understand Spanish. My favorites are Mientes Tan Bien, Ven, Que Lloro, Aqui, Amor Real, De Viaje y ABC."
2,"ABURRIDO, ABURRIDO , ABURRIDO....","QUE DECEPCION CUANDO COMPRE ESTE DISCO, SU PRIMER DISCO ES EXCELENTE Y COMPRE ESTE PENSANDO QUE IBA A SER INNOVADOR Y FRESCO, PERO ENCONTRE TODO LO CONTRARIO. MAS DE LO MISMO, 11 CANCIONES EXACTAMENTE IGUALES, CON BUENAS VOCES PERO MAS ABURRIDAS QUE UNA CLASE DE COSTURA. ELLOS UNA Y OTRA VEZ INSISTEN EN SU DRAMATISMO EXAGERADO DEL AMOR CON LETRAS QUE PARECEN TRAUMAS DE ADOLESCENTES MAS QUE CANCIONES ADULTAS. SI PADECES DE INSOMNIO ESTE DISCO ES PERFECTO PORQUE A LA TERCERA CANCION SENTIRAS UN GRAN ESTUPOR Y A LA QUINTA CAERAS EN COMA PERMANENTE POR VARIAS SEMANAS."
4,One of the best Morrissey tracks on the last three albums.,"""Boxers"" is one of the few essential Morrissey songs on the ""World of Morrissey"" record. The other two tracks on this single are definitely adequate, and will surely appease the seasoned Moz fan."
3,A bit misleading?,"The title is HP SCANJET 4600 ( Q3121A#ABA )<- A HP Scanjet 4600 (without anymore words) is a see through flat scanner (without transparency adapter). The price of less than $50 is entirely too low to be for real. In small print at the ""friendlysolutions"" listing there is the following:(...)REAL TIME availability - highly recommended before placing an order. hp scanjet transparent materials adapter ""Note the last word, ""Adapter""... apparently this is the adapter that comes with the Scanjet 4670 or can be purchased separately as the ""HP Scanjet 4600 transparent materials adapter."" The merchant does list the model number beside the name of the scanner but who would know that is an adapter.If you are looking for the see-through scanner look elsewhere."
1,what high-speed usb connection?,"this product would not work with my dell dimension desktop, even after i installed a pcia card with high-speed usb2. very poor technical support from h-p (india). what ever happened to h-p quality??"
5,Wonderful,"This is a magnificent SACD, sound and performance. Szell, in heaven, must be particularly happy with Sony's line of his masterworks.You will hear how wonderful old analog recordings can be and how refreshing it is to hear natural hiss. This has not been ruined by having it no-noised. Blows away PCM recordings.The Mahler 10 and the Firebird are particularly involving. I have listened to this over and over. Do not hesitate. Buy it."
2,una decepción,"Primero que nada, me encanta la música de Alejandro y Vicente Fernández y, por eso, decidí comprar este disco. Pensé que iba a ser tan bonito como el de Alejandro llamado Un canto de México, que también fue grabado en vivo, pero, desafortunadamente, no lo es. Sí, las voces son bonitas y la la selección de canciones me gusta. Sin embargo, no me gusta escuchar tanto aplauso, ni mucho menos el cantar del auditorio. Quizás este concierto fuera divertido, pero eso no quiere decir que se transforme en un buen disco."
5,Good Replacement Part,I've had same Braun coffeemaker for 20+ years--have replaced glass urn and had it rewired once in that time--but had to replace basket because plastic thingy that stops it from dripping thru basket into urn had broken off. Replacement part 100% correct and does do what it is designed to do. Cheaper than a new pot.
3,Mashmakhan Missing Mr. Tree,"This album has some excellent Mashmakhan tunes, but it is sadly missing one of the best, MR. TREE. I wonder why they left this song off the CD, and can the CD be bought with MR. TREE added?"
5,irreplacable referance for any hobby exhibitor of animals,"This book is one that has been handed down to me by old-time breeders of pedigreed dogs. I now am doing the same. The contents, phrases and ideas in this book provide innumerable names for the exhibitor of any pedigreed animal. Searching for ""catchy"" names for your next darling show prospect is often times fraught with frustrations. This book will help you and guide you to that perfect nomicker whether you have a pet or show animal. It contains unusual one word names and their countries of origin, as well as short phrases that can capture physical as well as behavioral attributes."
1,"Awful, to quite awful","There is a reason bands only have releases in England. This album is awful. The best track on the CD is the instrumental in the beginning. There may be one other song worth listening to, otherwise this album is a throwaway. I loved their second album ""Dropped"". Do yourself a favor and stay away from this one."
4,Good,"I use this product every day. Its very easy to handle and the best thing for me, it has two charging cradle for others places. The battery charge very fast.If you are nooby like me in 2 ways radio comunication, buy it."
3,pleasant surprise,"Picked this one up mostly on a whim not being real familiar with Brooks' work and was pleasantly surprised. Comprised mostly of straight ahead jazz pieces with a funky twist that showcase Brooks unique and often intense drumming. Also features trumpeter Woody Shaw and Bassist Cecil Mcbee. The cd is a good example of what was happening in early 70's jazz apart from the fusion movement. Standout tracks are Mcbee's ""Will Pan's Walk"" and Brooks' ""Five For Max"" the former utilizing some of Mcbee's most intese bass lines. Overall, a good buy."
2,Not the Right Size,"I have an older iMac G5. I believe I received it for Christmas 2004. This 2GB RAM did not fit our computer. It (the computer) has a 2GB max capacity, BUT it has to be in the form of two (2) 1GB chips. I had to return this item & purchase two 1GB RAM. I also thought this price was really high. The replacement RAM we ended up buying was far less.I hesitate to give this item 1 star because I'm sure it works for some computers, just not the one we have. Check yours before purchasing!"
4,Shake not stirned,"Very nice album. Although some songs can make you feel down, most of the music is perfect. It has a little bit a Moby style."
5,Anything by Zucchero is good,"Zucchero's voice never fails me in any language. I've recommended him for years and after this CD, even more so."
2,Can you say overkill?,"This is the novel that made me leery of Susan Conant's novels to come. Not that the mystery wasn't good...it was as good as any of her previous ones. I also understand that alot of dog lovers are unaware of where those cute little puppies in the window come from and how truly appalling and criminal the condition of true puppy mills are (although in my tiny part of the world, the pet stores get their pets from local, reputable, small time -- sort of hobby--breeders).So she describes the vile puppy mills once. Cool. Another time to impart more info. Okay. But before it was all over, I had a headache from being hit over the head again and again and again and again about the wretched dogs in the mills and the even more wretched people running them. This subject seems to be one of Susan Conant's BIG buttons, which I understannd, but she needn't push it so much. Either that or put on a warning of the cover when an obession is going to take over the book."
2,Very disappointed by author's fat bigotry,"I've enjoyed the other books in this series, but not this one. I'm fat (212 pounds) and I really didn't appreciate the way Holly Winter reacted to having the fat female malamute breeder touching her. Although the puppy mill owner wasn't fat, whenever Ms. Winter imagined one, she always saw the villain as a fat man. She even used the term ""pig"" in one description of his face. For an author who has tried to combat other forms of prejudice in her novels to display the stereotype that fat people are physically and morally repulsive was very disappointing. I hope that someday she realizes that fat people deserve to be treated with courtesy and respect, too."
5,"Two WOOFS! and PAWS!! up! (Sorry, couldn't resist)","Ms. Conant continues to entertain those of us ""in dogs"" with her delightful tales (or is that TAILS?) of canine who-done-it's. I have read them all and hope she writes many more. A great read."
2,"Cute, but not durable","I loved the dog; reminds me of mine. Sadly, the doggy fell off soon after I added it to my bracelet."
5,Another Winner,"Wow. Not only would I say that the latest Benni Harper story did not disappoint, I would add that I'm most impressed with how Earlene Fowler has kept the series from becoming predictable! As usual, the characters seem so real to me that I feel like Benni is my personal friend. This story takes an edgy turn, and I felt like I was feeling Bennie's emotions with her.I don't know quite how Earlene Fowler does it, but her books keep getting better and better. Unlike other authors who seem to loose steam when writing a series, this series seems to keep going strong.Thank you Earlene for a wonderful couple of days! Do I have to wait a WHOLE YEAR for the next one?"
4,good series,I enjoyed this book very much. i recommend you get all of the books in this series by this author
5,Great mystery!,This book series of Bennie Harper is fantastic! I hope that Earlene Fowler will consider writing more. They are great!
5,Connections,What can you say about a cable: it works. It seems to be made better that the original cable that came with the recorder that broke after 1 year.
5,A CD that lasts,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 6 months. Now she is four and my son is two and they still love it. ""Little Red Caboose"" is there absolute favorite. Plus, I love the original renditions of Puff and several others. A great CD, you will not be disappointed."
4,"MOSTLY WONDERFUL SONGS, but weaker at the end.","Terrific, engaging, not too ""elevator music."" 1st 13 tracks are the best, but the Doobie's lyrics on Winken, Blinken and Nod are unintelligible and Paul Simon's St Judy's Comet is boring. Everything else is great! I recommend as a great gift."
4,Collected past points way to future,"This album is quite a compilation of favorites, time-tested songs performed by adult-popular artists of great musicianship. Kids start life new, so you can never go wrong with classics like these no matter how much the songs age.I noticed that many reviewers were thankful in particular that this is a CD that remains enjoyable to them as adults while their kids play it over and over again, because of the excellent songs and top musicianship--these qualities are definitely missing from lots of kids music.However, I can wholeheartedly recommend one artist whose music is rich in texture and variety, singable and is just as much fun for parents as kids; the underexposed Skip West has put out two stellar albums, 'Blue Sky City' and 'All Around the World', chock full of original songs to delight and expand little minds while having the musicianship and depth to keep parents sane on the 7th listen of the day. Enjoy :^) You can thank me later, hee hee."
1,Only 4 songs!,"The cover has all these artists listed, my cd came with only 4 songs on it. I had been looking for a specific song, ""Winkin, Blinkin, and nod"", and I thought it was on this cd. All that this cd has is ""Little Red Caboose"", ""Skip to my Lou"", ""Garden Song"", and ""The Banana Boat Song""."
5,A must for your collection,"This is a big favorite with the whole family. My daughter who is almost 2 yrs old, has been listening to it for the past year. Favorites are Somewhere Over the Rainbow, Wynken Blynken & Nod & Choo Choo song."
5,Humming from it right now...,"We listen to a lot of music with our two and four year old children while driving in the car. Usually, after I drop them off at daycare and school, I can't wait to shut off the stuff. With this CD, not only do I not shut it off after the kids are gone, I turn it up, and then press the repeat button for some of my favorite songs! I am recommending this to everyone with kids who like music."
4,Worthwhile,I was very impressed with these binoculars - especially when considering the very low cost. Very Nice!
1,Biggest POS In the PC World,"I've gone through 2 in 6 months. Optical drive failed on both. The good thing is is that the first one was swapped on the spot. Bad new is that the second will be gone for 4 weeks while they ""fix it"". Look elswhere...."
2,Awesome,Best bookKxjxnxnxjxjxjxjxjxjdidjxjIs is is is is o I is Susanna is is is is is is sis shenanigans
4,I loved it!,"This was the coolest book I have read in a long time. I usually don't read books, but Gary Paulsen was my kinda guy. He was really graphic about what stuff he wrote about. I liked the chapter called Eating Eyeballs. I think anyone who likes adventure stories would like this book. And the cool thing is that it is all true!"
4,bacon plus,"GUTS by Gary PaulsenI would recommend this book, because it gets you hooked right from the start and the ways things happened to Gary Paulsen make him a crazy writer with experience with what he writes making him an expert on what he does because experience is always better then have to make books with out knowing much about the topic but I think who ever likes a Gary Paulsen book should defiantly read this book I would give this book a 4 out of 5 ."
5,Guts is the best book ever!,"This is the most amazing book in the world! if you haven't read this book, stop what you're doing and read this book immediately!"
5,Childhood on the Hunt and life in the Woods,"In the autobiography Guts by Gary Paulsen, he explains what life life was like for him growing up in the wild. He explains some of the things that he had done when he was hunting for small game in the woods or something that happened when he he was in the Iditarod in Alaska or when he was being pummled by a moose in the middle of a river heading down stream to set the fall traps. This book is like a autobiograph of ten different people and their childhoods all packed into one person. He has seen things that only some people could think of, and then portrays them in a fairy tale manner. The book does not drag on like some, it is a very fun and exciting book to read and a non stop cliff hanger that will keep you reading until the book is done and then wishing that there was more to read. I suggest this book to anybody of any age."
3,About this book,"If you want to read this book, make sure you have read at least Hatchet if you want to understand the book well.The book tells about Paulson's real life expeirences that helped with storyline of Hatchet. That is why he wrote the book, to tell how he came up with Hatchet. That is the book at breif."
3,Not good.,"At first, I was excited to see it has been publish. But when I listened to it, I found that it was so different from my anticipation.Before I listened to this, I thought all the songs with vocals would be the original versions in the movie. And I thought the instrumental versions are just like the background music in the original songs. But the songs with vocal in this album were not sung by the initial performers, then it made all these songs strange, and all the initial comical, romantic and wonderful feelings lost. The instrumental versions are not good either. Some vocals haven't been removed. What has been removed was only the principal vocal. I just couldn't figure out why some vocals were retain in the instrumental version. Can they be called instrumental?I think this album is not good, even I can say that it is the worst of Disney Karaoke Series."
4,Hero's,"I like to look for hero's. Parents are one that earn the title. Working parents? ""Three-Ring Circus"" narrows the media-made cavern between the wars and misconceptions of stay at home parents against those who work. I get to stay home with our two kids. It humbled me to see how hard these parents WORK to BE THERE for their kids. This once viewed ""cavern"" is narrowed with plain talk of parents who absolutely love their kids, deal with life's struggles, challenges and show the committment of hanging in there all in trying to keep the balance in life. That's a hero I can look up to!Barb AndreasStay at home Mom of 2"
2,Binder Only,"Bought on Feb 4th and got it out to use today 2/13 and was shocked to find the machine does not punch the items you want to bind. Four of the punching dies do not raise up enough for even 1 sheet of regular paper to fit under. When I turned the machine over I could see the dies just dropping down and when I pushed them up with my finger they would just fall down again. The box showed damage but had a sticker on it (UPS) that said "" Important Note - Damage to outer carton has not affected the product inside. We have inspected the product thoroughly."" I'd say it had been dropped and the dies were knocked off. Check your shipments when they come..."
3,Good Enough,The dress wasn't made exactly like the picture when I recieved it but it was nice. Even though the workmanship didn't seem 100% professional it didn't fall apart and everyone thought I looked hot so I'm happy.
3,"Hmmm, a bit risque","The fabric was very thin and the split was pretty high, I was going to wear it on stage but after trying it on I quickly decided against it."
3,Wish they were wider.,"These toe bandages are good for the price and are made well. They are the best I have found so far - but I wish they were wider. We are using them for our elderly father's big toe and these are just not wide enough. I have found wider at CVS but they only give one big - one medium - one small in each package and so we end up not using the medium or small sizes and that is why we tried these over the internet.If you can use these for any other toe besides the big toe, I think you will be very happy with the product. The delivery and packaging were just fine. No complaints there."
3,Protection,it is just okay..but it didnt meet my expectations.insufficent protection my toe nail. I bought it for toe but size not proper for toe.
4,sore toe remedy,product works as described. I just cut it into toe size pieces and slip over the sore toe and it cushions it from pressure.
4,Where's the respect?,"Here is a stylish and talented disco diva who left us with a couple of killer songs and a strong overall body of work, and I think that Barbara Pennington would be insulted (and rightfully so) if she discovered that this disc was being sold for only one penny.Anyway, Barbara Pennington first came to light with the big 1978 disco hit ""24 Hours A Day"" which remains one of her most classic works. Though she only made a couple of albums, it is clear from listening to these that she has some real disco blood in her. She came back strong in 1985 with the minor but uber-cool hit ""On A Crowded Street"" which has a timeless stylishness to it. Its obvious disco influence makes it sound like it could be from 1978, but it's well-crafted enough so that it doesn't have that ""1978 called and wants its sound back"" feeling about it either."
4,For the Mrs,"On a Crowded Street and 24 hours a day where the tracks I knew, but the Mrs loved the rest of this album. A birthday present."
2,Crime...for sure,"Very disapointing. The loss of Chris De Garmo is one, that in my opinion, is just too much for this, one of my favorite 80's bands, can overcome. The recording was lack luster, and the mix left much to be desired. I'd stick with the studio release on this one kids, or at least wait until it hits the cutout bin."
5,Live Evolution = a new revolution!!,"There are some people who think this disc is a waste of time. Those are the people who aren't smart enough to understand Queensryche's music. Live Evolution is an amazing testament to the career of Queensryche. I was at the first show in Seattle when the CD and DVD were recorded and the ""Ryche"" have not lost a step. This cd is a must have for all Queensryche fans. If your not sure who Queensryche is, I recomend this CD and Operation Mindcrime to add to your collection. This CD marks the first realese for their new record label ""Sanctuary Records"" and I look forward to their next release, I'm sure it will be every bit as impressive as this one."
4,Always evolving,"Been a fan for such a long time I gotta say that Geoff Tate and Co. may be one of the last bands on earth that can smash your head to pieces playing live. Some may think that Geoff can't reach those high notes like he used to do, and they may be right, but the fact is that these guys are performing way too good (I mean WAY TOO GOOD) to be an almost dead band. If you can get your hands on either the DVD or VHS you'll have the chance to prove yourself that these guys still rock!I gave the album 4 stars just because there were many songs that could have been on this compilation, but you just can't please all the people all the time (can you?) :)"
2,Time to give it up!!,It is sad when you hear a band you have enjoyed for over 10 years lose it musically. Geoff Tate sounds awful (especially on the music prior to Q2K.)This has to be an attempt to cash in one last time on a name that (in my eyes) has lost all musical credability.
2,A bit disappointing . . .,". . . and the most disappointing aspect - Geoff Tate's vocal performance. In many songs, he foregoes his characteristic high notes for a lower key (e.g., ""Take Hold of the Flame"") and in other songs, he just gives up singing the high portions altogether (e.g., ""Queen of the Reich"" and ""Walk in the Shadows"").Also disappointing were some of the arrangements (e.g., ""Spreading the Disease"") and the repoire (or lack thereof) with the audience (e.g., the middle section on ""Empire"").For live Queensryche, I highly recommend the reissue of 'Operation:LiveCrime', which has far more venom and is superior to the original studio recording."
3,3.5 Stars,"I'm not a fan of live albums although I buy just about every single one that comes out. Queensryche came out with this one so I had to buy it. It sounds to me that Geoff Tate isn't very much into it on the first CD. I kind of expected a more powerful Geoff Tate, more like a studio version. But it isn't there. I never had the opportunity to see them in concert and this will help to make up for that. Overall, not bad but could have been better."
3,I was at the shows....,"...and for whatever reason, these 2 discs failed to capture the engery in the Moore Theater. To some degree, the band killed alot of the energy by stopping regularly to let the production crew capture the event, reload cameras, etc. Still, I found the recordings to be sterile."
2,Very poor recording,"The recording is quite poor. Lots of clipping and occasional crackles (listen to Walk In The Shadows - very annoying). The music itself is OK, I guess, but I was really disappointed by the shoddy production values."
5,excellent,"I discovered Mia Doi Todd via an itunes entry that caught my eye, and I quickly bought everything of hers I could find. She has a very nice, sultry voice, and I am a sucker for acoustic folk."
3,"okay, not worth the money","I was expecting a lot with all of the good reviews and how much money it cost for 8oz of ground coffee. Well, I was and am disappointed. It's smooth and good, but not great and not worth the money. I guess if you say something is from Italy it's automatically supposed to be better than American coffee or anywhere else. I have had American coffee that is better than this. Nothing else to say."
2,A bit cheap as to quality,"This swimming pool was inexpensive, or a reason.This has to be made in China. I would not recommend."
3,Difficult read...,"I only rated this book ""3"" stars because of the way it's written. Grammatically speaking, it's a difficult read due to the old English style of writing, but I'm certain that since it WAS published in 1884 (or thereabouts), the grammar is perfect. Stories are slow to read but enjoyable. This isn't a book you can breeze through or scan through, as I have a tendency to do - I purchased it for research for a novel I'm writing."
4,computer tote,"Lots of space for computer and all items associated with the computer, plus extra space."
5,Audio tapes are great company,"Don't be intimidated by six audio tapes. Jack is excellent - the tapes are rich with examples, stories, and jokes. They are great company in the car or wherever, as we travel the path."
1,not what ads said,not what the ad said it was it wasn't tie downs meaning more than one but it was a single pack
5,books to buid on,"As a Reading Teacher, Books to Build On is an excellent resource to assist in finding and assessing quality books. It is broken into curriculum areas including Visual Arts and Mathematics whichare oftentime overlooked in bok reviews. It includes a wealth of information about books for children from grades Kindergarten to the sixth grade. It is also crosses the genres and genders by providing a variety of fiction, nonfiction, collections,series, multi-cultural and multidisciplined books. I have shared the information in this books with colleagues and parents. It was also instrumental in selecting materials for my own students and children."
4,Very helpful book,"This book is very nice to have if you homeschool. It is very easy to use and a great resource. It is broken into curriculum areas including Visual Arts, which has really helped since I did not know much about the subject."
3,Books to Build On,"This is a useful book but one I don't believe you need to spend your money on as it is available at the library for free - and it's not a book you need to refer to daily or even weekly. Check it from the library, make yourself a list of what books it lists that you need from that, and return it."
4,"Mixed bag of goodies! Just like Amsterdam, eh?","New York Dolls, Elvis Costello, Brian Jonestown Mass., The Lyres. Shaken never stirred. Vuola!!! Deadly Snakes baby cakes. Eat it and love it then see it later then put it inyour player and rock it!! 1200 watts please."
4,"Honest, heartfelt folk","Steve Goodbar and friends remind us what real music is... In this age of electronic -- let alone amplified -- music, acoustic guitar driven tunes are often pushed by the wayside. Don't be fooled! The tracks on this album are wonderfully chosen and recorded and offer a nice taste of this artist's work. I've seen him in folk festivals in the Phoenix and can tell you that his many live incarnations (Mingus Mountain Moonshiners, etc.) are worth the effort!"
3,Its raining cats and dogs,"I prefer the Its Quilting cats and dogs which I also purchased, but I am not sorry I bought it - only don't know if it will make me rush out and buy fabric."
2,Utterly boring,"This book deals with a topic that it very interesting to those who study foreign relations, though the author paints a picture that is hard to digest. I am a college student attending Harvard, and I was told to choose a topic for review. This topic would eventually lead to a paper which would ultimately lead to my final grade. I chose to research comparative governments and their political parties. I came across this book on Amazon.com and thought immediately that it would provide perfect information for my paper. As I began reading the book, (mind you, reading as well as politics are passions of mine), I found myself nauseatingly bored to tears. It took every bit of strength I had to finish the book, but I did. In the end, I never used the information in ""Politics on the Fringe"" in my final draft. And I'm certainly glad that I didn't, because my A paper may have turned into a D for DULL!!!"
3,great,"good cd. and don't y'all forget, its Deborah now, not debbie. what a lady. we loves you so much."
3,No...no...no.,"M.Y.O.B.: I have tried to keep my mouth shut. This is another attempt of Deborah's to be something she is not. By far her best and true to herself CD's are: ""Out of The Blue"", Electric Youth"", and ""Think with Your Heart.""Deborah's collaboration efforts are wonderful, but not for her recordings. She needs to find an unknown talent or pass her other stuff (such as the songs on M.Y.O.B)onto other artists to record."
3,"its ok, serves the need","Has some good songs on it, has a pop feel to it and a different genre of music"
2,Disappointed in MYOB,"I'm a fan of Gibson's music and have always felt that she has great talent, but I think she missed the mark on this album. There's not even one song on this album that I like very much. Perhaps I need to give it more of a chance. Right now, I've listened to it only twice. This cd contains more upbeat material and has more of a Brittney feel than a traditional Gibson sound. I purchased it based on all of the positive reviews, but I completely disagree with them."
2,Where is Deborah in these recordings?,"I miss the old Deborah. This new Deborah, to me, is not improved. She should be writing her own songs, rather than recording other people's songs. I don't know if she has just run out of ideas and that is why she is recording other people's songs, but the result is Deborah's awesome voice on mediocre songs that have none of the charm or style of any of her previous work. So, I am dissappointed - although the CD quality is very good, and Deborah's voice sounds golden as always. However, of her newer 90's CD (since she has been known as Deborah), her CD's ""Deborah"" and ""Think With Your Heart"" are miles better than this, because most all of the songs were written by her."
1,This is the worst album ever.,"Now I have to tell you I wouldn't have even looked into this album if it weren't for this aritcle I read (which is entirely false, but it fooled me at first) stating that she was working with someone, who shall remain nameless, that is not in her genre of ""music"" and it got me curious.This is some of the worst stuff I have ever heard. What a horrible attempt at trying to sound up to date. Yeah she's got a decent voice, but these songs are horrible. This is just bad."
2,A very disappointed fan,"I've been a fan of Debbie's A.K.A. Deborah since ""Out of the blue"" & never thought I'd bad mouth her music, but this is just a CD that will get lost in my collection that I might listen 2 a few more times before letting dust settle on it. This is not the Debbie us fans used 2 know, there's no depth 2 the songs, & thinking back on what I listened 2 none of the songs stand out (Except maybe MYOB)...This stuff should just be labeled elevator music (Sorry Deb). She needs 2 find her roots again & speak from the heart (Like my fav lps: ""Out of the blue"" ""Electric youth"" ""Body,mind,& soul"", & ""Think with your heart""). The only reason I gave this album 2 stars is because I will & forever be a fan."
4,Very Cool,"I heard about this project by the Yo La Tango front man a few years ago (I think it was a Fan Club only cassette release or something along those lines). I was curious when I saw it had received a 'commercial release'. This is a great CD - the cover versions contained within are wonderful, lo-fi buzz and acoustic renditions. Particularly superb are the readings of 'Pop Life, Erotic City and the lesser known song 'An Honest Man' - which on this reading sounds strangely like a Neil Young song circa 'After The Gold Rush'(!) very unlike the gospel tinged ballad Prince fans have had on bootleg since 1986. Pick this CD up if you enjoy Mercury Rev, Granddaddy or the Flaming Lips or Yo La Tango. The songs are great - you've heard them all before all but in different versions by Prince..."
5,Casiotone school of rock!,"This is for the people who feel one day some pain,when it feels the lonelines can really make your heart a piece of darkness.The songs are very catchy, Prince would be pround with this Disc.And if you like Casitone sounds, well!You really need this songs...Thanx Pacollifor show me this piece of artof the nineteeens!!!"
5,awesome,"totally sweet cd. movie was decent, but the soundtrack is much better. it has a wide variety of styles and is great for all types of listeners."
3,Mi2 Rev.,I like mi2. The movie and cd. This is a good cd and if you like rock or alternative music give it a try.
5,The fragrance is so lovely and feminine!,"I have used this lotion for over twenty years and still continue to get compliments on the subtle lovely fragrance. The lotion keeps my skin soft while the fragrance lifts my spirits and makes me feel so feminine. I love this product; there is nothing like it! Over the years, this lotion has become so hard to find and whenever there was a special promotion, I would stock up. Now I can just order from Amazon.com whenever I run low... Thank you!!!"
5,Alyssa Ashley Musk Body Lotion,I have been using Alyssa Ashley Hand & Body Lotion for many years. Suddenly I was unable to find it in the stores where I used to purchase it. I went on line (Google) and found it for sale on Amazon at a very comperable price. I frequently recieve compliments on its fragrance and like the way it moisturizes my skin. I recieved it within a week of placing my order. I will continue to order products from Amazon!
5,So pleased to find this online!!!,"I have used this product for so many years I cannot remember when I first bought it. I get frequent compliments on its' light, non-offensive scent, even in closed elevators. It has kept my skin soft; and now, at 78, less dry and wrinkled than many of my contemporaries. I highly recommend it and, am so pleased to have found I can buy it online."
2,Needs improvement,"THe product arrived on time however, the perfume smell associated with this product was non existent."
5,Great Service,The items arrived very quickly and packaged very well. This is a favorite lotion and hard to find. I'm so happy that I found this and was able to buy 4 bottles. Thank You.
5,Nana's Favorite,The title says it all. She was astounded at how cheap it was online and got three bottles.Make your Nana happy and introduce her to the low prices of the internet!
1,Disappointment,"I thought this product was on the high scalelike ashley Stewart musk lotion but,this lotion hardly has any odor,its just a plain bottle of lotion,I'm very very disappointed,but I can't afford to send it back,this was money wasted,and I'm on a dixed income!!!"
5,thank you,"hello thank you for the fast shipping ,i am glad that i found this stuff to the amazon, i have been used for a long years when i was in the Philippines..thank you and more power"
2,90-minute Mass setting with 15 minutes of music,"Good intentions all around, but Sandstrom's High Mass is simply too long and drawn out. Yes, there are some beautiful moments, also things to be learned from various orchestral effects, but the work would have been infinitely more attractive if reduced to one-sixth its size. The performers do their absolute best -- the choral sopranos are amazing -- and the DG sound engineering is up to its legendary standards. This item is useful for aspiring composers as a case study of what works and what doesn't. It's AWFULLY loud in spots, so don't play it in the car or you'll be distracted.Lindholm's Kontakion is a valid example of 20th-century modernism, but not much more."
4,More Than Melody,Nica's Dream is great too. Gives all the extra written passages as played by the horn men Blue Mitchell-Junior Cook HORACE-SCOPE Blue Note CDMelodys for all songs are given as played by the horn men then Horace's solo is transcribed followed by the out chorus and the ending.
4,danceable foxy,"To be honest,outside of there hit track ""get off"",i had no idea who foxy was.Now that i purchased ""get off""The best of foxy cd.I still dont know who the hell they are,but i do like this cd.From there relentless bassline on ""headhunters""to there fun.lively groove of ""tinas song,this cd has absolutely no shortage of catchy tunes.If your thing is straight up dance tunes that will keep your brain and butt moving,this cd is a good buy."
5,best portable game system out there...,"ok the psp has some things the ds doesn't. but the ds has better games (and great ones coming), and costs a whole lot less. there's no way i'd spend 300 bucks on a portable game system just so i could watch the tiny amount of dvds the psp has available. the ds rules."
5,My NIntendo DS IS THE BEST !!!!!!!!! 4-sho,"On This DS, I am able to do lots of things. I am able to play games chat and all sorts of other things you can do on a compuuter ! On the real, this DS is weak. NOT !!!!!!!!! Where I am, (Monroe, Lousiana) for the Christmas holiday my mom said she had to bend over backwards to get the DS. She told me that they were sold out in the mall, Toys Rus, Sear, Target, Wal-Mart, and even most everywhere on the internet! This comes to show you that I myself does't thinh the DS is hot, but also millions of other people!!!! THE DS IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Yes! The Next Big Hand-held is Here!,"This is awesome! I have already pre-ordered one at GameCrazy and I am so excited about getting it! It has countless special features and it comes with a demo of Metroid Prime: Hunters, entitled First Hunt! Any Nintendo freak (like me) must own this system! I don't know what the best feature is. It's hard to choose from the following list: Dual screens, touch screen compatibility, voice recognition, a special slot for Game Boy cartridges, a built-in chatroom and wireless multiplayer! This system is gonna rock! The graphics are the same as the popular N64's. The games look amazing. Being a huge Mario fan, I have my eyes on Super Mario 64-by-4. You can play with up to 3 other players! Sweet!! I simply can't wait to get my DS. Nintendo DS is gonna rule!!"
5,My 8 yr old son loves his Nintendo DS,"This is my 8 yr old son's second nintendo ds. He accidently left his first one outside, and of course it rained extremely hard that day and ruined it. He loved it so much and was so disappointed that we got him another one. He is a very active child and plays with it when weather does not permit him to go outside. It is great for road trips too."
5,Great gift......,I bought this for my nephew's 5th birthday and he just loved it. He spends a lot of time playing with it.
5,wow,"I have been saving my babysitting money, my allowence, and doing extra chores around the house to earn extra money for more than 2 months so that i could buy a nintendo DS. I was not disapointed at all. The game system was, just, wow (there is no other word to describe it). It is amazing. 3-D, 2 screens, touch action. it's just... wow. :)"
5,YOU ARE TAKING THIS TO FAR!!!,"I love the DS! So what? It is a gaming machine! Nothing to start a vendetta over! If you post every day and Gizangen or whatever his name is, will post 1 star reviews on the PSP. See how neither of you can win? Get a life, personally. Doing this every day will get Amazon to fish out your IP and eternily ban you. Don't do it. I'm glad you made your choise of the PSP but why does everyone else have to agree with you? I got the DS cause I don't watch much TV, Movies, Music etc. I care about games. And the DS has been out longer. Thus, more games. Consider this. Every obsesive post someone makes, I'll inform amazon. This is a review for people who own a DS. Give good reviews to the PSP instead of negative ones for the DS. Just telling that guy how bad the DS is will make him madder and more stubern. Same with the PSP. Consider this."
4,Good!,"This gaming device is one of the best out there. But the psp is here and its not giving any mercy to the nintendo ds.The nintendo ds is a perfect outstanding system, but the games aren't any good except for metroid prime hunters,mario 64 and mario kart. If they can prove that they have good graphics then why cant they make them. Keeping that aside, this handheld is the leading and best, the touchscreen feature is the best and the dual screen is awesome. Overall this handheld is good for gaming specially in long trips where it doesnt make you fell the time passing. If you are willing to pay the price of this nintendo then go for it because you'll feel the worth of your money everyday you use it."
4,Nintendo DS,I bought this game to play Nintendo Dogs. The game has great video and easy to operate. The volume is ok not too loud. The touch feature is great.
4,Yeah I'm 14 years old and im just to lazy to put in my email adress,"I'm purchasing a nintendo ds!The only reason im not giving the ds a five star review is because im having a difficult time looking for a game that will interest me the most but, I'm very satisfied with the up coming games to release in november and decemberThe only problem i have is what game?I give the ds system a dragging 4 out of 5"
3,I just only wanted to ask you this!,"I just wanted to ask a Favor from other Reviewers on this system. After you buy the Nintendo DS from Fred Meyer, Wal-Mart,or Amazon.com Do you like get a free game along when you purchase the DS?"
2,MAKE IT STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!,"OMG, I cant believe i bought this!!!!!! this system sucks!!!!!!!!! this is why i hate nintendo had helds!!! i have 2 games; Mario kart and trauma center. let me talk about the flaws:1. I feel like ive seen it before.2. game quality you would expect from nintendo. bad gameplay graphics and propaganda about inovative new features3. Stylus to hard to control!!! it may slide across screen an ds wont respond!!!!I could go on and on about this but i dont feel like it!!!!one really annoying thing was i got this with my Kwanzaa money. i paid 130 dollars and now i cant get more than 70 dollars for trading it in. i will do it just to get it away from me!! Take this to no offense but anyone who thinks this is better than psp they are too stupid to turn on the psp or are still in the nintendo phase. pay the freakin' 100 extra dollars and get a system that is sleek, serfs the web, plays dvd's, save images and has itunes!!!! i am going to do that."
1,1 More Thing........,"I was just reading on back of the other reviews that said DS would get better graphics than the PSP as seen in Meteos.......Your Wrong! The DS CANT have better graphics than the PSP. 2 examples: Lets compare SW episode 3 on DS to SW battlefront 2 on PSP! The PSP mimics the console version of Battlefront 2 while the DS SW episode 3 game mimics the graphics on GBA. And if you have seen ridge racers on PSP intro you know that you probably wont even see it on DS in 07'. Besides, if you look at specs, PSP is more powerful than PS2 while DS is only slightly more powerful than N64.P.S. I have both PSP and DS and I havent touched (literally) my DS in 6 months but maybe that will change with advance wars........but then again thats only 1 game......."
1,PSP owns,"in response to the person who wrote PSP SUX I have something to say to you: you made a mistake trading your PSP in for a DS. And why is nintendo a trusted brand? OK maybe Sony isnt the MOST trusted brand but they certainly know what they are doing. Nintendo make games for 11 and under children. I rather have something (PSP) that they targeted for 13-30 year olds. Thats my biggest gripe against Nintendo is there lack of M rated games. And no, I am not some violent punk. But really the best games are usually M rated (halo 2, half-life 2, doom 3). By all means Sony did not copy nintendo's gba. Thats like saying that sony stole controllers from nintendo. Holding up the original GBA up to the PSP, the GBA looks like something you would find in a happy meal. And original games? Mario 79, Donkey Kong 32, and Metroid prime 24? Please Nintendo has many more franchises than any other company ever will.UP WITH THE PSP"
1,hmmmmmmm?,i cant believe you people like the ds! im really confused i dont even play with my ds any more. the psp is much more better i own both psp and ds i havent touched the ds for ages now.just because the psp costs more you will get a lot more fun.if your patient enought to save up for a psp get one dont waste your money on a ds. infact i think im gonna put my ds on ebay with all its rubBISH GAMES
2,Ds sux!,"GTA will beat Pokemon by a mile. That game GHOST IN A SHELL is a hot game for psp, better than that James Bond game for ds. and that freakin NINTENDOGS game. It makes ds more childish. The reason it makes ds look bad and childish because it is mising two things....PITBULLS, AND RUTWILERS(i Apologize for the mis pronouncistion). Im sick of NINTENDO always one step behind the leading company. MICROSOFT IS taking their place and NINTENDO is a thing in the past so guys get used to it."
2,Okay,"Sure the whole touch screen thing is cool. But Nintendo focused on none important things. Whats the point of having a touch screen when the system has 1 good game? This is like a game with good graphics but sucky gameplay. You can have cool features, but if you don't have good games, then it is a waste. PSP is a lot better."
1,Horrible. Enough said,"To start things off, I'd like to say that the wireless communicator dosn't work on GBA games, play half of the games sure, but not all if it? When you play Game Boy Color games on GBA, you could play all of it.Another thing, the touch screen dosn't work, when you hit left you go UP,no good.My friend got a game for Christmas, where you create an IM-ing profile, and games cost $35+.Oh yeah, you can't play Game Boy or Game Boy Color games on it.The IM-ing only goes 100 feet, not exactly ""real IMing"" like my friend thought.The price is WAY too much $200??? ARE THEY CRAZY $200! If you're gonna spend that much buy a PS2.Plus alot of the games are just N64 games."
1,I hate you kid,"I hate you kidyou may be a nitando fan but your stupid your stupid your stupid and your stupid I hate you you think you so rightjust dont lisen to him peopleI mean came on people a PSP is cool sony has always been cool I was 5 when I got my PS1 andstill love soney PSP better graphics better gamesstar wars 1 and 3 games or the nitendo games donkey kong and dumb other games PSP and sony producs 5 ***** stars, nitendo producs 3*** stars."
1,PSP ROCKS!,i was not happy when i saw that nitendo made a new lame gameboy called DS it is just another prototyp and i youst to be a big Nitendo fan but now i am going sony crazy psp are so cool so thank you sony
1,song whatever,"i am mad when i turned it on the game did not work i must of tried 1,000 times then it started playing some dumb song going like this who's the super cop who always gets the bad guys dounut boy who brings you a delishish usortment sweat delights, ug it was gross dounuts iam alergic to dounuts"
2,It was a little dissapointing for me..................,"In all the reviews i read before buying this game, they said it was an mp3 player, and a scheduler. I thought, ""How cool! An mp3 player and a schedular! Wow, and only for $150!"" Little did i known that the ""schedular"" was just a crappy alarm that you could only set once. You cannot set up anything for any dates you want either, it has to take place at least the next day, or that day itself. And, i won't even get started on the MP3 player, because it does not even have one.As most of you know, the DS also has Pictochat, a cute, but useless system you can talk to person with. I thought you could ""chat"" with people anywhere, but when i tried to connect to my brother (who also has a DS) who was upstairs, aboyut only 5 feet away, i couldn't reach him. Is that dissapointing, or what? In addition, they have only about 30 games in total. Now that is retarded! You're better off just getting a PSP for so much money!"
5,Finnaly!,"The DS is in color. This console is great. But really,what is the difference between the PSP and DS? Let me explain the easy wayNintendo DSPros:+2 screens means double the gameplay!+Touch screen too neat+8 to 10 hours of battery life+Games are more valuble+A microphone in it+Plays GBA gamesCons:+Dos'nt play GB or GBC games (we don't care)+No Rated M games (there will be soon though)Play Station Portable:Pros:+Amazing graphicsCons:+4 hours of battery life+Batteries break easily+Terrible games+much moreThe PSP should not have been made. Wow! YOu can take pics with it! Let me just grab my camera! Cool! Music,7 songs only! My computer holds 100's of songs. oh man! Movies! Let me get my DVD player and watch it in BIG SCREEN! Whoa! Games on the PSP! Let me grab my DS because that is a real gaming system. The PSP will not make history but the DS will. Get the DS now!"
4,FIX THE POWER BUTTON!!!,"My mother-in-law gave me this for Christmas and I love it. However, the power button is HORRIBLE!!! You can be in the middle of intense gaming and your thumb slips up and TURNS OFF THE GAME!!! This has happened to me many times. They should make it like the power switch on the Gameboy Advance SP.Other than that, it is GREAT! My 5 year old son enjoys it as much as I do!"
4,"Amazing, but have caution...","This is breathtaking! All I can say is WOW! But, here's a down side...be careful if you are going to give this to your kids anytime soon. The game card that you use to play the games is not made to just pull out like you can in a Game Boy Advance. You HAVE to push it in first and wait for it to eject on it's own. My friend accidently pulled it out and it is stuck, but luckily I got a replacement. Just remember that! I don't know why Nintendo didn't design it to take more abuse than that."
5,nintendo ds,It's my son's new favorite gadget. I had a pleasant transaction with the seller and very much satisfied with the purchase.
4,You get what you pay for,"Many may argue that the PSP is to expensive, but I beg to differ.The Nintendo DS is a nice machine with a fairly good design but you get wht you pay for. The quality of the DS is good but only that. The 200 dollar and below price is nice, but some people may want more. The PSP has great quality, but for some it may be pricey.In the end choose the one that fits your lifestyle and budget.And I wuold like to add that you can pre-order DS's in different colors just like the SP(...)"
4,This is a great game console,i just bought this and the graphics are the best ever but the touch screen could be better because you have to press a little harder not just like a little tap but a little harder but i would suggest that you should get this for a birthday or christmas
5,Nintendo has done it again,"For years, nintendo has dominated portables, and the Ninendo ds is no different. With its dual screens, touch capabilities, and a growing library of games, I believe that this system has what it take to stay on top of other portables, (even the PSP!)"
3,Not as good as I thought,When I bought this my friends said that it would be the best portable game console ever. I bought the Super mario 64 DS game and it wasn't too bad. The graphics on this console surpasses the Game boy Advance but still I was expecting better. The clam shell design is really nice because the screen will not get scratched. The silver isn't too bad but it just feels a little cheap. The touch-screen is pretty cool but sometimes it can get in the way of some games. Pictochat is one of the best features of this system. You can write or draw pictures on the touch-screen and communicate with your friends wirelessly. i like the Sony playstation Portable a bit better but still both of them aren't as good as they good be. I like both systems because I like the company Sony and the company Nintendo so I can't choose which one is better. I hope this review helped you out and I hope you make the decision you want to because they both have pros and cons.
2,Nintendo DS SUCKS,"Now I have been around since the first nes came out in the 80's and I have seen many systems fail and suck but nothing can compare to the DS. My friend has one of these and he and I both agree that it sucks. Nintendo is screwed now that the psp(which I have)is going to do much better than its DS. The reason why a psp is better than a DS is because the psp can play mp3,movies,store pictures and has better games and graphics than the DS. So for any kids trying to get a new system please don't get the DS. I am begging you not to. Get a psp or wait for ps3 or xbox 360."
3,Firmware/Hardware bug - pictochat stopped working !!,This edition of DS has major software/hardware bugs. The pictochat stopped working just after 1 day. I can't join the channel. It was working fine for 1 day. The touch screen is working as I can use it for other things. Just the pictochat functionality is dead !!!!!What kind of junk nintendo is pushing on us for an outrageous amount of money ????
2,"okay, but flawed","I bought this system about a month ago, and it is not as great as the hype says it is. For one, wireless usage is extremely useless. The connection only works over a very limited distance,so games are okay, but unless you can't walk over and talk to that person, pictochat is useless.Also, once you get over the gimmick, the 2nd screen is only realy used in 2 games, and the stylus controls sometimes work , but usually they are are at best slugish and at worst useless.The screen can scratch with enough effort, so it is not good for any minigame game, as I unfortunatly found out. The arrow keys don't work well for 3D games,the thumb strap is comepletely usless, the games are boring, the screens become dirty fast.Too many problems, I only recommend this system for nintendo freaks. Otherwise, stay away."
3,ODD,"Don't get me wrong, this thing is cool and worth a lot of money, but I know a kid who has one and his life has not been drastically[or even minorly] improved."
1,Crapital Punishment,"To start off this review, I want to say that I own both the PSP and the DS. I am very disappointed with my purchase of the DS. There are no good games at all for the DS. The graphics are very poor also. Why would you get a DS when the graphics are so poor that you could play Nintendo 64 and have the same graphics. I mean seriously. I returned my DS and bought more games for the PSP. The PSPs graphics are excellent and the screen looks like a mini plasma screen T.V. It is a portable DVD player, MP3 player, and a video game console all in one. The games are excellent and you can have all this for only 100 extra dollars. You could be playing full, excellent games instead of the poorly thought up DS mini games. Go and get a PSP while you still can."
1,SO FUN...,"THIS IS SO FUN. WAIT. WHAT AM I SAYING. PLEASE LET ME REPHRASE. THIS IS SO FUN FOR 5 YEAR OLDS. CRAPPY GAMES. OK GRAPHICS. LIKE THE N64. ALMOST NO GAMES. THE PSP WILL DEFINETLY CRUSH THIS AND THE DS WILL DIE AND EVERYONE WILL FORGET ABOUT IT. I GOT IT FOR CHRISTMAAS AND RARELY PLAY IT ANYMORE. THE GRAPHICS AREN'T AS GOOD AS ADVERTISED. THE PSP HAS PS2 GRAPHICS. AND CAN PLAY MOVIES, MP3S, DIGITAL PICTURES/SLIDESHOWS, AND GAMES OF COURSE. SHAME ON YOU NINTENDO!!!"
1,This Kinda sucks...,"It just does. Woo Hoo Two screens. Who cares? PSP Kills this thing. I own both so I am being very fair here. The PSP lets you browse the internet, and I mean real internet, no cell phqone internet BS. Also the graphics are WAY beter. The games are better. Why you thing Rockstar is releasing GTA: Libery City Stories on it, instead of the DS? 'Cause Nintendo straight up sucks. I thought the DS was cool after having it for a month and I got a PSP. You can do WAY more than the DS. You can't put your MP3 Songs, Videos, or Pictures onto a DS, now can you? Aparently Not. PSP --Yes you can. Also you can keep up in track with Sony as they release Updates for the Filmware for the PSP, the DS is as plain and boring since the day you get it. The Graphics suck. SONY kills nintendo, except for sales, because the PSP is a little bit more and people decide lemme be a cheap ass and buy a piece of crap. Well they get what they pay for. Do yourself a favor and not get it. That is all."
1,hunk of junk,"this piece of junk is a wast ofmoney $130 come on I would rather buysomthing thats worth the money, Idont have a Ds but take my advice donot get it, my friends have one and their notso happy with it, and we rather get a star wars actionfiger,.. anakin, obi wan,...$4.77 you know suport hasbro and their prices I will not support Nitendo till they lower their price.. and make the Ds better and fix the stupid songthat comes on.. dounut boy song"
1,stupid,"I hate the graphics of it I wish I could rate 0 stars, when I got my Nintendo DS the pen broke then the screen broke and then the sound didn't work I think a gameboy advance is better I think [...] o yah I forgot that the light would not work I think that the Nintendo DS is breakable."
1,I hate this nitendo ds,I hate this nitendo ds I hate this nitendo ds I hate this nitendo ds I want my money back i bott this for $350.95 i think anywon who is going to buy this pleas get psp or anything els. why because the grapgics are bad i feel like iam playing a gamboy advance and a gameboy color at the same time. the pen is verry fragile and my screen stop working in like a week and when i turned it on it did not come up the game for about a hour so pleas do not buy this it is so junky
1,Nintendo DS Good or Bad?,"In my Opinion the DS is not a very good gameing system. The graphics suck, it can play those dumb GameBoy videos that are expensive (unlike the PSP that has good cheap movies) and you get bored of it, I mean I have one and its in a box ready to go back to the store for a PSP. I wrote this for all of you people trying to buy a DS. Don't do it, you will get very disapointed. I recamomend a PSP.Let's talk about the graphics. The PSP's graphics are so good!!! You would be amazed! The DS's graphics are not good, for instance on the Spider-Man 2 game for DS it shows a side wiew. Hello people we want better!!! The PSP's Games are like PS2's games. Some my Friends prefer the PSP instead of the DS."
2,Nice but seema to be more a hype.,"The games on the DS is geat but the system it self has a bunch of useless features and seems to just complicate a simple game. Also with all the 3D enhancements and so little buttons... it limits the possiblities and the having a extra screen just makes it more expensive,heavy,and neck breaking.PSP seems to be a much better system with much more useful features. Though if PSP don't have a lithium rechargable battery... It's screwed. But I suggest...DON'T BUY A DS UNTIL NEXT CHRISTMAS. They will probally be cheaper and you'll won't have to worry about ""What if the PSP is better?!""Final Conclussion:I'll wait for a PSP.A DS is...-Bulky-Ugly-Graphically Nice-Useless Features with annoying navigation.A PSP is...-Compact-Stylish-Graphically Amazing-Useful with (seems to be) easier navigation."
1,Nintendo=kiddie company,"Nintendo is a kiddie company. The people who play games from Nintendo are usually kids. And no, I am NOT a violent kid but seriously, mario and the rest of the charcters nintendo has created are getting old. I love shooters and online games and PSP is going to have both.P.S.EGM said Metroid for DS at E3 was terrible"
2,Wait for psp,"Ok, I've got to hand it to you, there are a lot of fatties who give bad reviews. The DS is childish and lacks style. Im mean come on, why the hell does it have a touch screen? Thats not inovative, thats just stupid. I was accually an owner of the DS until I returned it. Now im a proud owner of a PSP and Im happy. Its sooooo awsome. I hear, its run on demons sent by lord satan. But seriously, if your a true gamer and luv the PS2...you will like the PSP. I've got the Japinese version and It rules with an iron fist. Eh, oh if you keep looking for reviews for the DS, you will run into a kids review that talks about cursing on the internet and it makes no sense. Its quite funny and will give one a laugh. There must be something wrong with him, I bet his DS was filled with AIDS, causeing him to be stupid.....Cya"
4,Really good,Nintendo ds is an excellent game system but I like sony psp better than Nintendo ds.Sony psp I would say has better graphics than Nintendo ds thats all
1,Hey Nintendo freaks...,"Let me make a long story short, everything sucks on the DS. I have a PSP and it is very addicting and better then are worst system EVER!!! I hope you throw away your freakin DS AND BUY THE BEST SYSTEM EVER,the Sony PSP!!!!!(PS: Nintendo did a great job on Resident Evil 4. Its my favorite game. I can't wait for The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.)"
4,"Alright Gzagon, just stop complaining u loser.","Shut your mouth and read. You lame excuse psp hater losers always say ""oh, get an ipod instead of a psp"" ,""get a dvd player instead"" ,""you can use a laptop to surf the internet"". SHUT UP!!!. The psp was made so u dont need to have your ipod,dvd player and sidekick fill up your suitcase because sony has all of those features built in on single device. Thats something NINTENDO will take years to follow up. I just cant see it that somebody would buy a DS instead of a PSP, GTA is comming out soon, not for Ds, for PSP. Why do you buy a ds? Its because youre a loser, people who thinks DS is better than PSP is a BIG LOSER! Buy A PSP if you are COOL."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Graphics: Total mess. N64 had better clearer graphics, and most of the games looks like they belong on GBA.Games: I don't see any games worth owning. Yoshi touch and go is just stupid.Gimmick(touch screen): totally stupid and pointless.Look: It looks like a toy for a little kid. A freind of mine has one, and whenever he plays it on the bus, I pretend I don't know him.Avoid. It has no online, and in order to talk to people, you have to be, like, 5 feet away.Plus, who else will have a D.S?get PSP. Nuff said."
1,poking a screen for fun is boring!!,touch screen big woop you have to clean because of the finger marks is stupid nintendo you let a lot of kids down get a PSP it rocks!!!!!
4,Nintendo's BEST System Yet,"First, let me assure you that I myself do own this system. This system is amazing!!!!!!!!!!! I have only 1 thing that I didn't like about it. The only Game Boy games that you can play are Game Boy Advance games. Although most people will be playing mostly with DS games and using other built-in features, it would still be nice to be able to play Game Boy games. Everything else about this system is great. The touch screen is awsome and I chat with my brother all the time with PictoChat. You can chat with up to 15 other people within 100 feet using PictoChat! The Metroid Prime demo is almost a game and you can play against someone else in multiplayer. The DS games are like half the size of Game Boy Advance games. I really like Mario 64 DS and The Urbz. It was hard to get but I'm glad I did. These are so hard to find so go on Ebay. They have tons and thats where I got mine. Get this system today!!!"
5,Nintindo DS (Trey Winbush),"Employees at Amazon,I think this is one of the best consoles ever, next to the PSP. This is like when the Nokia Gage came out except for the two screens. On both of these items you could talk to other people, but on th DS you dont have to pay for every month you chat with people. This is the number one thing on my Christmas list. As you see I've rated this a 5 star toy.You Customer,Trey"
5,Must Have,"As I said in the title, this is a must have device. The Nintendo Ds is trying something new, and Nintendo hit the bull's eye. While some issues occur (Gb/Gbc games not fitting/playing, having to shut off system after pictochat, ect.) SOme things just go over those problems, like the touch screen, pictochat, the ability to play GBA games and some Flash Cards for GBA, some of the issues don't seem so bad. It comes with a demo of ""Metroid Hunters"" with 3 modes (Training, Free For All, Ball(NOTE: These may not be the right names)) ALso, Hunters Demo come with 3 full DeathMatch arenas. So this is an obious must-but system."
3,Nintendo DS,"I really don't know why almost everyone spends there whole review talking about how terriable the PSP is, and i'm goin to list three reasons I hate it people doing this. 1. The PSP is afabulous system with great great games, controls, Graphics and capabilites. 2. The point of reviewing the DS is to review the DS not the PSP. 3. 90% and yes I really caculated 90% of the the bad thigs said about the PSP are not true, such as dead pixcels sticky buttons and other problms. What these kids don't understand is the DS has just as manny problms such dead battry live defetive touch screen and so own. In other words all electorincs have problems it just may not be yours. Back to the DS the DS is a very fun system. It has a few neat apps suchs as chat 100 foot wi-fi. The games are fun but I don't know if it's just me but some of the blokier games give me a headache. Verdict: The DS is a very good system but I enjoy the PSP much more."
5,The BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the best handheld system released by Nintendo ever! The stylus makes playing the game soo much easier. If your looking for a video game system for yourself or a loved one, BUY IT NOW!"
5,Better than a DS,"If you don't believe me, then you obviously never played it. It's cheaper, it has better games, and is going to totally rule with the new mariokart. Buy a DS, you won't be disappointed."
3,It is okay,"I just got a Nintendo DS for Cristmas, and I like it, but...It is not a portable system. Now sure you may think it is portable, but it does not fit in my pocket. After I got this, I was so happy...then I played it, when you think about it two screens is stupid. When you play this system,your eyes dart from one screen to the next, so your eyes get tired very fast.Next is the fact that the games are a lot of money, most of the games are around $30.So over all this system is'virtual boy II'. And people please stop comparing DS to PSP, because if you play both systems, it is like comparing the color Red to the color Blue.Thank you for reading my reveiw."
5,This thing rocks!!!,I could not beleave Nintendo was making another portible hand-held system! The Nintendo DS looks so cool that I marked it at the top of my wish list! It's just so cool!
5,nintendo lite ds and ds,"there are two types lite ds and ds of which i have both and in all color i own ice blue, electric blue, polar, coral pink, original steel ds there great you can chat so when the kids need to be quiet they can chat with each other plus one can insert the game to one console and all can join in the nices part they never get tired of it and since it so high tech the graphic are really amazing and worth the price even thou ice blue is hard to find and much more then standard lite ds worth it this product always seems to prefect it's technology to the veiw of the player"
5,Don't listen to these psp kids,"They don't know what they are talking about. The system, games,and price are all AWESOME for the DS. The PSP is an overpriced piece of garbage. Buy the DS, you will be happy."
1,Stupid place for the power button,I played with one of these at Best Buy yesterday. 3 times the machine turned off due the power button being placed just above the directional pad on the left being accidently bumped. The idiot at Nintendo who designed this should be fired. I will wait till they come out with an updated model.
1,another poor attempt.,"i was looking forward to this handheld, until i found out it's using catridges again. it looks like nintendo is digging their grave by holding on to cartridges for so long. sega and nintendo made poor handhelds over the years using cartridges which couldn't accomodate the best games back then. and the ones that did get ported heavy stuff had to be cropped out ** cough Tekken advance cough**. cough ** Mortal kombat 2 Game Gear cough**. i was looking forward to this thinking it would be using CD's like the PSP, and it's not. just another poor handheld again on the market with cheesy games. Oh yes and to the guy who said that nintendo games are for gamers 12-21 years you couldn't be more wrong. nintendo games are for gamers 12 years and under. no teens and adults wants to play kiddie games. anyway since this will be another handheld using cartridges, i'm going with the PSP we got PS2 graphics, using CD's which will be able to accomodate the best games out today. No thanks DS."
3,Something to Think About,"I bought this system thinking it would be great and I would have a lot of fun with it, I also talked my frieds into getting them. But I honestly think that Nintendo really did drop the ball on it because of the following.1. They only have 5 games out for it.2.They need to release more games in order for their owners to not buying the PSP.3. Half of the companys that were planning to make games for the DS are not because the system apperars to be dying.4. Most of the games out for it aren't even geared for anyone 12 and up.My recamendation, wait, think it over and if you still want to get th DS then get it, then by all means buy it, but if your looking for a more advanced system that has a better chance of suriving and looks a lot more promising then get the PSP."
5,DS is AWESOME!!!!,"Nintendo DS is the best handheld game ever made. All the games have awesome graphics and you don't have to change batteries. Instead of batteries you get to charge it.By,Bobby"
3,"Its cool, but does nintendo care that much about quality?","I have a nintendo ds myself; its very cool, but when i bought it, the was dust INSIDE the screen. this gets in the way when im playing a game.......but if i'm at a right angle, i cant see it, but if i'm not, it looks like theres a missing pixel.Also, they make it look like you can't scratch the bottom screen......actually, you CAN! just from using my finger, there's already a small scratch on it. It's small, but its still a scratch. It might've been there when it was being built, but still, nintendo should have a better way of making screens. If i can, i might consider taking it back. My main point is that its a really cool product, but it's sort of a let down when you open it up."
2,"From what Im hearing,","This kid with the sub ""Nintendo and Sony Roles"" must be a Big Lord OF the Rings, Star Wars, lives with his Mom Nerd. Dude get a life and move out."
4,The why they have made the DS.,I like the DS. The reason why they made the DS is because the DS is for children under 12. If you give a child who is under 12 a PSP they will break it and the PSP is more harder. A DS is for children under 12.
1,"wow, if crap could talk, this would be it!","crap talks, okay? and the ds is absolutlely it! it's basically a gameboy with two screens. so crap on the ds and get a psp."
1,I HAD A DS,Hey I had a DS. I thought it was fun and all with the touch screen. I was thinking the the DS would be better but I was wrong. Nintendo wanted to release another handheld. I dropped the DS. Here are a couple of reasonsGraphics SuckLack of INNOVATIVE GAMES (skip that lack of games)Repetitive games and gamplay sucksToo much hype about the piece of junkIt is too bulkyYou have your opinion I have mine.Be smart don't be a retart get a PSP you'll be glad you did!!
1,A comparison,i would just like to point out that the psp although it does not have a chat system or any thing else on it that the ds has (although im not sure about that) that the psp hase a digi camaera a dvd player an mp3 a playstation2 and one or two other things. i havnt bought any of these but if i had a choise i would go with the psp. i put all 1ns because i dont know since i do not have this item.
1,"FALSE ADVERTISING on Nintendo ""Package""","The main page for the Nintendo DS offers a discount if you purchase a package of 3 items. It also gives you the promotional code to use at check-out.This is advertised on the website boldly and without any reservation, as far as I can see.I added the Nintendo bundle, along with more games and other things, to my cart. After checking my cart, I became aware that one piece of the Nintendo DS package was unavailable at this time for shipping.So--my promotional code was refused at checkout. Sounds like bait-and-switch to you? It has that feel to me.Look at the facts: glaring advertisement for ""deal""; notice upon checking cart that one part of deal is not available now; refusal of promotional code (rain check, anyone?)at checkout.I dumped the whole cart and quit my shopping trip. I hope that you do the same.Sharon GableLong-time customer, now extremely dissatisfied"
1,Multiplayer disappointment,"Tired of having to buy two game cards in order to play someone else? Don't look at Nintendo DS for much help. Although they have the capability for multiple players to use one card, very few games utilize this feature. The Nintendo web site won't even tell you if multiple cards are required. That may not be important to them, but families that are forced to buy multiple cards from the same game care."
1,The psp pink screen issue,As said in one riview about the ds he complained that the psp is defected becouse the screen turned pink! well if you were a little bit smarter you would be able to figure out that the screen color changes every single month!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so if anyone complains about the pink screen issue and returns the psp for it just know that you are complete idiots!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! dont buy the ds buy the psp its way better!!!!!!!
1,Boo! Bad System with bad games,"The DS is not really a good system. Its weak system wise and the games are not exactly good. They SUCK!!!. The systems graphics still have 2d stroller games. Don't buy the DS. Get the PSP or if you don't have enough money, save up for Xbox 360, PS3 or Nintendo Revolution. Do Not Waste Your Money on the DS!!!!!!!!!!! Buy PSP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,rediculous,"big whoop...touch screen who cares...ive played this at a AND THOUGHT IT WAS AMZAZING, i almost bought one BUT then i heard about the PSP and read about them and compared them in every way possible and over psp won by alot."
1,"Oh Nintendo, why do we hate thee?","Yo.you may have heard nintendo ds technology,but the 2nd screen is used for a map, and the use catridges for games instead of cds.Tsk tsk.Games are lame, very little,to easy to beat and on and on and on.you can't even play multiplayer for gba games and you can't play gameboy color or gameboy games.Buy a ps2,an xbox, or even a psp.one last word.nintendo ds sucks!"
1,DS SUCKS!,look at the title i know that ds came out before psp but think about it IT IS GAY MAKING A PDA A GAMING SYSTEM i mean creative idea i have a ds and i hate it i dont knw why i bought it i mean sure in the future better games are gonna come out o yea and for those kids eviews maybe your saying a ds is more durable than psp BECAUSE YOU CANT HANDLE a psp your gonna break it psp is way better nintendo is cool and all but psp just kicked ds's ass in this contest.
1,Not even to par with the N-gage,"Unless E3 has something spectacular for DS, this is could turn into this era's virtual boy. Go to gaming websites, even the n-gage has a higher number of 8 rated games than DS. Nothing can change the embarassment of that."
1,I am sorry but this is the worst thing ever made,"When I got this, I got this for one reason Mario ds. I wasted ever penny on this and I don't want you to make same dision.1.The grafics our the worst2.It is all mini games3.everyone I know hates it4.they will come out with ds advance next yearAnd the ds advance will happen, cause it always does"
2,OK PEOPLE LISTEN,"You people are complete idiots! PSP is 5X better. The double screen thing is stupid because then you have to use the stlyless and try to control the buttons. When Nintendo Revolution comes out 6 to 8 year olds buy the ^@#% system. Nintedno DS does not have WiFi who ever said it did. Stop lieing to kids because your making them buy somthing thats going to be returned in less then a mounth! The DS doesn't let you share photos, it's not capable of videos, nor music and world wide internet! It's completley useless!. It's more of buying 1994 PDA!PSP SPECIFICATIONS:PSP: 333MHz CPUVIDEOS: YESMUSIC: YESPHOTOS: YESWWW.: YESINTERNET: YESCUSTOM SETTINGS: YESCHANGE BACK GROUND: YESBATTERY INFO: YESNIN DSNIN DS 92MHz CPUVIDEOS: NOMUSIC: NOPHOTOS: NOINTERNET: YES (ONLY 100FT MAX!)WWW.: NOCUSTOM SETTINGS: NOBACK GROUND: NOBATTERY INFO: NO"
2,It is safe,The PSP is safe but it CAN be safer by getting a case. I saw a video where some japanese guys hit the PSP with a baseball bat and it appeared untouched (but it was painful to watch).
1,Its not a gamecube.,"Note that is says ""Platform: Game Cube""Please point out ONE gamecube game that will run on a nintendo DS. In fact, please explain how the GameCube discs fit in a cartidge system.Mmm kay thanks.Its WAY overpriced. The games are pretty lame, and the screen is tiny. Stick with the GameBoy until the price comes down. Thats my advice."
1,wow...god job,this thing is a piece of work it looks like a brick that someone spray painted silver and the graphics are HORRIBLE.if you ask me id tell you to go with the psp. i do like nintendo but they really should have made something that has 3D graphics on game. plus PSP can hold movies and music
1,Retartd DS,first off i dont reccomend this peice of [...]or retard psp they both suck! get a gameboy sp aor advance or ps2. this is a hunk of fat!
1,THIS IS TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!,"I for one, have no idea how you are supposed play this.Two screens gong at the same time HA, you've got to be kidding. The graphics are good and all that, but the controls don't make sense. When you hit left on the touch screen you go UP,no good at all.As for instant messaging, kids don't need that junk,you instant message from a 100 foot distance(...). I WOULD NEVER BUY THIS(...). It dosn't work right, dont buy it,seriously.Oh, and another thing it can't use wireless communication if you are using a GBA game , play GBA games half way sure, but not all of the way.With GBA you can play game boy color games ALL the way , not only half of itP.S. kids don't need I.M."
2,cool but will not buy,"I would love to get this but no the nitendo ds company has to be moneylovers i will not buy this item until it is a lower price like $100.00 not $130.00, get real nitendo i hate moneylovers lower your price, i mean my my dog was cheaper than a nitendo ds i will never buy this item until it is $100.00 think about it, i have 20 friends of mine who think it is just to high of a price and they think nitendo are moneyhogs. So anywon who is going to buy this item do not until it is $100.00 OK OK"
5,Very Awsome!!,"Electric Blue Nintendo DS:The Nintendo Ds is the ideal game machine for anyone.This small hand held system can go anywhere and it`s beautiful blue color is great for boys and girls of all ages.There are also fun games you can play such as Nintendogs,Kirby-Canvas Curse and many others.The other exciting feature of the DS is a thing called Pictochat where you can draw pictures,type text and do much more to send to friends atleast 30 feet away from you.Not all Nintendo DS games have WI FI connection which gives you the ability to play with people from around the world but if you do get a game such as Animal Crossing that has this feature you will really enjoy it.I highly recomend the Nintendo DS."
5,what are you doing!,"not everyone here wants to be called a nintendodork including myself. Uh I have a question for the person that made the graphics enhancer post. Where did you get that information? did you know that nintendo revolution and it's contruller will get reviled at toyko game show 2005 on September 16 or the 17. I whish they have a red DS in america in the future. not including Ebay. nintendo DS is selling more than PSP and PS2 in america and Japan. In japan, nintendo DS is selling 200,000 units more than PS2. one milllion DS units were sold total in japan."
4,My new fav system!,"this video game system is awesome! it may be a little pricy ($150) but i think its worth it and if you are smart you could find one at a garage sale thats where i got mine for only $50! Anyway its good, it plays nintendo ds games s well as GBA SP and by the way psp sucks get the nintendo ds instead. here is some pros and consnintendo ds pros:foldable to protect screendual screenswider selection of gamesbattery lasts 3x longer than pspcosts a 150$ lesscons: smaller screen than pspthe games are more for younger peoplethe graphics are a little worse than psppsp pros:games for more mature peopleyou can watch dvd quality moviesdownloadable musiccons:screen scrathces easybattery life is shortvery few gamesso i would get the nintendo ds"
4,it plays vidoes and music also,"for those who are deciding to buy a psp becasue it has the ability to play movies and music. The DS can also do this too, with a attachment that accpets compact flah cards that you can load your media on it from your computer and play it on your ds"
5,Trust the positive reviews,"There really isn't enough nice things to say about the Nintendo DS. I think it is the most revolutionary and fun gaming system that Nintendo has ever put out. I am a big fan of Nintendo from way back in the NES days, and I am still a huge fan today. They continue to prove that even after 20+ years in the gaming market, they still have new ideas and tricks up their sleeve. They are always willing to experiment to deliver the gamer the best system and the most unique gaming experience. I love the touch screen! I love the games that have already been released, and the best are yet to come! I can't wait for the best games to start coming out. Buy the DS! You won't regret it!"
5,Love it!,"The blue color is even better than the platinum. It shows scratches a lot less, and the blue tends to make the color screen look even more impressive. I'd probably prefer this one over the regular color. I hope they come out with more colors in the future, like they did in Japan! If you want different colors, go to ebay and search for the DS's they come in black, turquoise, pink, and a few others. DS rules!"
5,better than the PSP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"to compare these is easy first I will review the PSP it has no mulptier controls there is no way to play more than one player the DS can play up to 16 players wireless. the PSP has good grafics but boring games. the DS has classic games such as mario ,metroid prime, and more just as good plus you get a game with it.the PSP has a movie player but who cares. the DS has a chat room up to 16 players,plays gameboy advance games,plays gameboy movies,has a new touch screen,voice activation,a bigger screen screen than the PSP,and a light up screen,is that enough features to cover PSP moves and grafics. the DS is much better than the PSP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,dish on ds,"I have a nitendo ds since nov.21 and it rocks in my own words it is better then psp I think you should get the ds, also the psp won't be out till about march.Thank You :>"
5,Please read...,"Sony got its start in gaming by working for Nintendo back when Nintendo was considering adding a CD addon to the SNES, similar to what Sega did at the time. Sony broke off and decided to invent their own system, the successful PS1 a few years later. Ever since, people have been fiercely loyal to either one side or the other. It saddens me to see people slam Nintendo nowadays, even though they are true originators in the gaming field.Without Nintendo's immense contributions to gaming, Sony would NEVER have gotten into gaming in the first place. Please think about this before posting that 1 star rating.... please."
5,This fine system deserves more 5 star ratings,I think the blue color is awesome. Read my review in the other DS message board to hear my thoughts on this great system.
5,I think blue version is better looking,On amazon it says that blue color is selling more than silver. I think it is because the color is better looking and scratches do not show up as much. Either way the system is great. Get this soon
4,What a witty insult!,"This is your comeback? Making fun of my handle and then boasting the PSP, offering no real resons behind it's supposed superiority?It it annoys you so much my name is Michael.Oh, and I don't need a PSP to browse the web when I have a laptop this does that in 13 minutes less than you did, and all those other functions of the PSP.-Gzagion"
4,What kind of name is Gzagion?,"Probably some Ds fan loser. Look here, PSP is just getting started, the games are going to suck now just like what happened to the ps2 when it came out. Stop attacking the psp saying it suks and is a ps2 port. Whew.... man, I wrote this review fronm my psp' web browser. Taking me 15 min. to write this, can DS do that? No."
3,"Good, but not the best","The Nintendo DS is so cool when you first get it But after a few weeks or months you'll get bored, but that's just my opinion."
3,good but with a few flaws,"I got my nintendo ds last year and there have been some bad and good details.I love the fact that on some games you can play 2 player with only on card in a ds(but they need more games with that ability).the ds needs more action games like shooting games, most all the games are either japaness or child geared. It takes time to get use to the touch screen (the thumb strap helps!!). Im not much of a nintendo fan or psp fan but it would be nice to have better graphics and from the looks of it that is a strong point for the psp. The wifi connection would be nice if they made more games with it (i want to get metriod prime hunters when it comes out). To my opion i gave the ds 3 stars mainly because there is not a big voriety of games and not many shooting games at all."
4,I'M gonna get one a kid's review,"I don't have one yet but my friend dose, i think the 2nd sreen is unnecssary. they could have had just 1 ONE screen but you touch it. all in all think i'll get one 'round christmas!"
5,"This really works. It Works good, and it has a reasonable price.","This worked very well. It also had a reasonable price. It is expensive if you think about it, but i saved up. And it was definently worth it."
3,"Old tech, buy a Lite","Don't be a cheap fool, buy a new Lite. The screen is brighter, doesn't come with scratches (like a used one will most likely have), and it actually fits in your pocket."
4,Great Game But It wearss out after A While,I got a Nintendo DS 2 years ago and already the L Button and the Hinge to the Top Screen have already Broken the L Button Broke a year ago and the top screen broke after it was acidentally dropped on Plastic Floor Covering that keeps our carpet white because we all have Office Chairs. Now I am having to send it to Nintendo and Pay the $75 to have the L button and the Hinge fixed or replaced. The same Thing Happened to My friends Nintendo DS.
5,WOW,"i think this will really revolutionize gameboy stuff and pocket stuff forever.....i dont really feel like just repeating what everyone else said like everyone else is doing, so i will just say READ THE OTHER REVIEWS! this thing is the best....all that stuff (...)i mean....look at the PSP and then DS.....PSP looks ok with the movie and music playing and all but you have to wait until they turn the movie or music you want into the certain cd or whatever that goes into the PSP.....DS is compatible with GBA games too so no waiting! and plus.....how many people are gonna pay 300 bucks (estimated price according to something i read) for the PSP.....i mean ds is alot better and (...)!!! i am going to pre order right now...."
1,wow i can tell now why you bought a ds,wut are you 5 saying psp stands for piled someones poop and peeing pants that just stupid for that you deserve to play with a ds. kid u have a sick mind and a wicked sick mind for posting it on amazon.com. i bet anyone who says that has NO freinds
1,MAAAANNNNNNNNN!,I hate Nintendo FANS!!!!! They do not understand that PSP is better than Nintendo. That feud between those two kids that hate each other more is very childish(not to affend that Sony fan)Why dont you argue over these consoles more maturely.P.S. I hate that Nintendo fan alot. Including that loser Gzagion.
1,Very Satisfied,I purchased a nintendo ds in november and received merchandise fast that I purchased another one for my nephew which he loves!
1,Eh.,"There are several cool things about the DS. They are: the dual screen and the ability to play previous GB models. Other than that its pretty boring. The games are made for younger audiences for the most part. I would reccomend save up (...)and buy the PSP because of its extra features such as the ability to sore pictures, play music, play movies, play games (obviously), and go on the Internet."
1,...,"one two three BOOM. i dont like this it isnt fun. get the psp it has better games. stupid mario, stupid peach, stupid yoshi OKAY LUIGI IS COOL, stupid bowser, stupid wario, stupid ds, stupid touch screen. get the psp, and yeah you people who complain about sony fanboys were not fanboys, half of us arent even boys, we just want people to buy the right thing and dont get stuck with a useless thing like this.wow how can u say psp has bad grahics t has a 333MHz PROSSECOR when DS has just a 67MHz prossecor so u chose high quality(psp) or this ***THING******PS I HAVE PLAYED BOTH***"
1,yes,"listen to the 1 star reviews we all should be heard. the ds stinks dont buy it plain and simple i played it and it was fun to START then it got bad etc. touch screen is stupid i mean who wants to have to touch and play at the same time???????????????Yes it is durable...who cares its graphics stink, id prefer a gameboy over this junk"
2,OK enough with the fighting,DS is OK (I have 1). But PSP is 15x better. If you are over 10 you will most likely enjoy the PSP the most.
4,9V Blue,"The color of this DS is not as traditional and sleek as the origonal, platinum colored Nintendo DS."
5,the best gaming system ever,"i always was a game freak, when i picked this up from my cousin will. i always thought that nintendo would think of the best ideas ever. but never this toy. my mother told me that this toy was so popular, that the onlt place she could get it from was [...]. hi. im melissa age 10, and i am in love with this toy. on december29(my birthday) i went to best buy really quickand there were so many boys crowded around me to watch me play, i could barley walk! i saw people playing the try me and when i walked by kids looked dissapinted that thet diddn't have thier own. i felt so proud! i take it evrey where now. my cousin also got nintendogs and he lets me play. i cant wait to get 3 new games for the ds: nintendogs, the sims 2, and sims(i dont know what version this is) the ds is a big hit and i can't wait to own puppies, with out sneezing and having to wash my hands or stop to take athsma medication. im now the proud baby sitter of nintendogs, until i get my own set of puppies."
4,wow,this product was a present for my little brother it looked good so as long as he ijoys it witch i know he will it was over all a good deal
5,im aint jealous about PSP,"The Kid who said we nintendo fans r mad at psp fans...HE SUCKS!!he doesnt have 2 type dat CRAP.i like sony and microsoft but nintendo rocks hes just a Terrorist Fan alright(he deserves it,according 2 me hes dissing me"
1,it's just a gimmick,"It's not so much a system as it is a gimmick. The fun will wear off in the first 10 hours. I'm sticking with my sp for now. The games are terrible with the exception of castlevania, advance wars, and i suppose mario kart. Haven't played that one though. On the bright side, i'm sure games are easy to make cause the little cards can only hold about 120 megabytes of data."
1,Let's see......,"K....first off, all of these reviews that place the DS over PSP are written BEFORE the PSP even came out! I bet most of these fanboys never even tried out the PSP! THe PSP is much better. The DS is rectangular, so it isnt contoured to the shape of your hand. Second, ""game cards"" (and the other cartridge-formats that nintendo decided to use) limits the graphics capabilities. Anyone remember the N64? fuzzy textures? its worse with DS; theyre jagged now. And they're all kiddy games. Who wants to spend 30 dollars on a game that consists of five types of minigames (cough.....warioware) that has barely any replayability! ALso, you cant even access the home menu of the DS without turning it off first! What the heck! In the long run, PSP is a better deal"
5,Just in case u don't know...,"Just in case u don't know, downloading movies is pirating, which is illegal. If you downloaded a movie on your PSP, expect a visit from the FBI. Really, I've seen it done."
2,Not so good,I was planning on only getting the PSP but i played a demo and got the DS. It is ok at first but gets boring with the limited features and games. The controls are also difficult to get used to. overall this is fun at first but not so good.
4,PSP or DS?,"I am a Nintendo ds owner, and i have to say its awesome.But i was expecting more, the thing is i cant put down what i was expecting more of? I have read up on the psp and it looks twice as better.The screen and the graphics, now dont get me wrong the ds is awesome but what the psp as to offer is unbelieve. Even though its not out for America yet the, Japan have it and they are saying its awesome. But no one will know entell there both out. Nintendo said there going to have online but were is it? There both awesome system but i would wait for both to see which one is the better one. I wish i had."
5,I love it !!!!!!!! Good choice for kids,The nintendo ds is the most fun handheld video game in the us .
5,DS vs PSP,"For all the morons out there who rated this product 1 star,let's begin , starting in japan the psp is rated 3.5 stars,which is not good , but the ds is rated 5 stars , so before you trash this item and saying that id better than the psp, PLAY WITH THE PSP FIRST THEN REVIEW THIS ITEM!!the ds has good games ,like zoo keeper ,pokemon(not out yet),and mario ds , and please don't be writing that kids don't need instant messaging,what do you know?Some games the psp has in japan are rated 2 or 3 stars!!.People if you think this product isn't for you get a SP ,but if you really want it buy it and don't listen to those morons , ok? or simply wait for other future gaming systems . bye"
5,WIFI - ! - More pics at Nintendo DS Mario Kart Bundle page,"WIFI is the bomb! I have the red version and posted pics of it yesterday under the Nintendo DS Mario Kart Bundle page.P.S. The use of 'then' vs. 'than'. I've seen more and more misuse of the word 'then' recently. The word ""than"" is used as a comparison, e.g., ""I'm better than you at Mario Kart!"" ""Then"" is used to denote time passage, e.g., ""I'm playing Mario Kart first on the DS and then on the GameCube."""
4,Wait for the Sony PSP if you are a gamer of any kind,"I Own the Nintendo DS, and while a very good system, I was hugely dissappointed by its shortcomings. At E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo) People were told that its name would be changed, and that it WASN'T a Gameboy 2. Both were false, as it is still a DS, and is embarrassingly obvious that it is a sequel. The Graphics are amazing, I admit, and Nintendo is cashing in all of its credits in the Mobile Gaming industry. It is an inventive and fun product, but it will take more than good graphics and an overhyped touchscreen to win me over from the DVD and mp3 playback of the Sony PSP (Due in Mid to late March). It is a good purchase if you don't mind limited games, and an overall 'Kiddie' like platform."
3,Not too good....,"I must say that Nintendo made their graphics a lot better than before. I had Game Boy Advance SP and I tell ya that thing made my eyes hurt, the resolution was terrible. But with the DS, I had no problem playing with it for some time, the screen has higher resolution therefore it's easier on the eyes.I had a decision to make whether to buy PSP or DS? I decided to buy DS because I heard that there are a lot of good games for it and that the battery last longer. As for the battery lasting longer yeah that was true. But as for the DS having lots of good games? I don't think so. I've bought several games for the system and nothing impressed me. The only ""tolerable game"" is Mario Kart DS and this game is not even that good. This system will only be played at the time when I am really bored out of my mind for sure, since the video games made for the DS are not as fun as I thought they would be."
2,Nintendo = Mario,"I purchased my Nintendo DS in the summer of 2005. I was very pleased with the preformance, and still am. I currently have 3 games, two of which are Mario games....which in fact was the reason I bought my DS...for the Mario games. I now feel that I have outgrown my DS, because of the fact that the games are either for 10-12 year olds (Mario & Nintendogs) or for an adult with the new Brain Age game. The DS is more for the hardcore Mario gamer, or for the adult who wants to own a handheld video game. This is where the DS meets its downfall. There is no medium in the gaming, and only six (6) that's right SIX sports games. Becuase of the lack in sports and adventure games (other than Mario) there is not enough to make the average teenager purchase this item, and this is why many teens are now using the Sony PSP. Take my advice, and only purchase this system if you really want to play Mario, or you are an adult looking to pick up a handheld machine again."
5,cool... in a really weird way...,"The Nintendo DS (Nintendo Dual Screen OR Nintendo Developers System)is really cool... My friend has one and i've been sorta obsessed with it ever since i first played with it. Anyway, it's crazy how you can play a game with just a touch-screen (stylus) and your voice (Nintendogs)... and you don't even touch the controls!!!!!!!I love how the screens are back-lit so you can take your DS in the car at night.I also like the Picto-chat abilities!!Great Toy!!!"
5,DS now thats something!!,"Parents and or future DS owners!! We all might ask why does Nintendo come with a new Game Boy every year?That is a waste of money! But for this system it is better than the rest! It has PictoChat! If you are wondering what that is,it is chating ansd you can draw pics!!! But if you have a much older system like game boy there cartridges will not work...sad....But yes!! if your child is asking for one of these you should buy it!!It is much much better than SD and GBA!! Pros and cons next:Pros:1,It has blacklit light! So you can see during the nighttime2,It has PictoChat!welcome to the 21st centry!3,It has 2 screens ( but that can lead to a con to )Cons:1, The touchscreen is easily scracthed ( buying a starter kit with a screen protector would help)2, It has a stylus pen that could get lost then u have to buy more!that is all i could think of!!Well that is why you should buy a DS high quility and Great Gaming!Enjoy your gaming!"
1,nintendo is too kiddy,nintendo is too kiddy and thats why nintendo fans are mad at us psp fans we rule they dont so they complain cause ds is now going to flop hahahahaha@nintendo fans losers!!!!!!!!!
1,DS SUCKS PSP ROCKS,"dspros: cant think of nethingcons: no good games, plasticy, made for 4 year olds, two screens suck, bad graphicsoverall rating 1/5 (im being genourous)psp:pros: everything is greatcons: battery life (its ok)overall rating 5/5i regret getting the ds"
1,DS Sucks!,Oh my goodness DS SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hate it. List some reasons why you stupid DS fans think DS is good. I dare you to respond to my review.
1,OMFG,"Your all a bunch of losers! PSP Is like 10 times better than DS. No one likes DS anymore, and there games suck! Stop comparing lies to people, PSP Is better!"
2,DS,"(...)I disagreeeverybody who has a psp is jealouse! ill give you the reason why:---IM NOT JEALOUS-a ds has 2 screens---PSP HAS ONE SCREEN THAT IS ALMOST BIGGER THAN BOTH OF THOSE COMBINED-it has a touch screen to make games easier to play--NO EASIER THAN THE ANALOG STICK-it has a ds download so you can download games--PSP ACTUALLY HAS THAT TOO, ITS CALLED ""GAME SHARING""-it has the game mario cart and nintendogs only for the ds- OH MY GOSH...I SHOULD RETURN MY PSP RIGHT NOW JUST TO GET THOSE TWO GAMES!-it has a wi-fi---PSP DOES TOO, AND ITS HAD IT SINCE ITS RELEASE.-it has double screen---WHOA, SAID THAT ONE TWICE BUDDY-it has a fast charger so if you put it for 20 minutes you get 2 hours of gameplay---I DONT BELIVE YOU THERE-its easy to fit in pocket---PSP CAN TOO!!!!!!a ds rocks and has a lot of features who cant get on any system! a must for the holidays---LIKE WHAT, PICTOCHAT AND TOUCH SCREEN?"
1,AWFUL,Don't waist your money. I own both the PSP and the DS. DS is just BAD. All games are for kid's 10 and under. The graphics are simply HORRIBLE. The PSP and the Nintendo DS are so different. They aren't even in the same league when it comes to gaming. Don't waist your money save and extra $100. And buy the PSP.
4,A review from a DS owner,"I own a DS and I think it's great. BUT, it isn't perfect...The games are great and all, but the touch screen scratches easily. I've had my DS for 2 weeks and I've been very careful with it, but there is already a few scratches on it! None of the screen protecters out now are any good, so I suggest waiting until Nintendo licensed screen protecters come out to get a DS.Thank you for your time."
4,"Buy it, play it, NOW!! By Tyler","Enjoy playing others on your hand held game but are tied down by cable connections? I have a solution for your problem! BOOM! The Nintendo DS is the hand held game you can play other people at least 65 feet away. That means its wireless. The Nintendo DS has two screens, the bottom screen is the touch screen, and the top screen is the playing screen.You also can write to others. This option is called pictdo chat. You can write or you can type the words you want to say with the pinpoint it gives you. It has a clock you can set up so you won't be late for dinner or whatever mom wants you for. You can play Gameboy Advanced games if you don't have Nintendo DS games. Buy it now! The Nintendo DS does all this and MORE! Believe me this will not be a waste of your money!"
3,BE CAREFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This review is for all of the people out there that don't read the fine print about the DS.The DS is really cool, but if you have a lot of GBA or older games, you CAN NOT PLAY MULTI-PLAYER on the DS!You can still play the game, but you CAN NOT play MULTI-PLAYER with the DS, even if it is a multi-player cartridge. The only way you can play multi-player is if you have a DS cartridge.So.......for all of you wanting to upgrade to the DS with the expectation that you can play multiplayer with your old collection of GBA games, be warned that you won't be able to do so."
1,Limited,"I had just sold all my DS things to Gamestop a week ago. Let me tell you, I felt so limited with it. Tons of games, but they have no value. I got a PSP and it is incredible. Amazing. If you have a choice, save your money for a PSP. Again, the games have poor quality. And the console has very limited capabilities."
1,"Why nintendo have you betrayed me ,WHHHHHY!!!!!!","I own one of these please I am warning you dont buy this Im not some lil rich jurk I worked for one of these so hard its just not worth it believe me get a psp there actually cool and they can play movies,pictures,Mp3s,etc this is sad I tried selling it but its too late for those who already bought one dont kill yourself yeah its horrible sooo much therapy (sniffel,sob) curse you nintendo ,CURSE YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOU!!!!!!"
2,Disappointed,"DS caught my attention with stunning graphics (like those in Mario DS, and Metroid Prime Hunter)then I waited and waited and waited for more cool games to come out...and...nothing...still waiting. I wish i would have bought a psp cause then i could play better games and watch full length movies (guess that's the advantage of disc type media). Still waiting for another great game -- peace"
1,Yes it has a play Yan and a SD card BUT.,"Does the DS have a USB port? If not, how are you going to put your MP3 and Mpeg-4 at huh? This Play yan is a desperate help-in-need that DS is using and is trying to fully compete with the PSP."
1,Microsoft is the replacement for the falling Nintendo.,"You guys are a bunch of idiots. You think the Revolution is better than 360 and PS3? What did I get through telling you, 360 vs. PS3 is the long awaited battle. 3 is a crowd for Nintendo, Nintendo need to leave cause it impossible for them to get a victory over Microsoft and Sony. Guys check out their losing streak, they hadnt won against any body. What makes you think Revolution will beat PS3? PS3 is a supercomputer. It has the strength of about 8 to 12 PS2s thats what Sony said at the E3 conference. And Revolution has the strength of 4 Gamecubes. The only luck Nintendo has to beat Sony is to release their product before Sony's and that victory is very unlikely to happen. Guys, Nintendo is at DEATH ROW. They DO NOT stand a chance at X-box 360 and PS3. That is the greatest battle that Nintendo CANT compete in."
1,if you are comparing DS and PSP you better own both,"umm......Lets think about how much more psp can do then DS. I know you obviously got a DS for christmas or somethin and now you dont have the money to buy the PSP. As for the 1 GB crap, You only buy it if you want to play music and movies (i have a 512 mb and it works fine and it was only 70$). The 32mb card that comes with the PSP is sufficient for atleast 2 years just for games. If you are refering to play-yan well, you have to buy that and a SD card which is the same amount of money compared to the memory sticks that the PSP uses and dont forget you also have to buy the play-yan itself."
3,ok,I thought the ds got a lot more hype then it should have. It was fun but not to an exstreme.If u r willing to shell out the 150 for the ds u should shell out the exstra hundread and get a psp now the psp is impressive. It has better grapgics then a ps2. You can't say the same about the ds.
2,awesome until i saw...,"wow, i thought this system was incredible i was about to buy it when i heard aobut the psp...i mean how much better can a portable system get, yes if the psp didnt exist this would be the ultimate handheld but psp does exist so to bad, i played this at a wal mart and it was amazing but psp is even betterPSP 9.5/10 DS 4/10 PSP's only flaw really is the battery life DS's flaws are bigger, just gaming, two small screens HOPE THIS HELPED"
5,One of the best,"I have played the DS a few times and I have been hooked on just how fun it is. I think it is a much better system than the PSP, and it is also a lot cheaper which makes me happy. The games are all reasonably priced, and the touch screen really is revolutionary. Good job Nintendo."
3,DS read this usefull information!!!!!!!!!,"Please guys admit it that the psp rocks and the ds is ok.if you like little kiddy games get ds.if you like games boys and teenagers like get psp.ds esrb is usally 12 years of age or younger.the only bad game thats not to bad is splinter cell DS coming out June 28,2005 at eb games.com.still though its not that bad because its 12 and under.i have ds its ok pictochat stinks.touch screen gets scratched like h*** so you cant see the d*** screen like mine is scratched up.sound is cool.mario is the only good game.if you have a ds and not getting the psp get these game for ds nintendogs,lost in blue,and splinter cell ds.remember get psp if you dont want kiddy games"
4,BUY THIS OR YOUR A DORK!!!,The touch easily scartches but it has all new games for it and of course will have many more in the future. The graphics are excellent for a hand held gaming system... although the Advance is not able to hook up to the DS... the touch screen messenger is awesome... This is at the TOP ^ of my Christmas list... right next to a poker table............
2,Faulty Hinge breaks easily,My son received the Nintendo DS for Christmas and has used a total of 10 times. The hinge has cracked [...].
4,Show PSP who's boss!,"I think that DS's will beat PSP's out the window! I have always loved nintendo more than Sony. Sony is going to go crying to their moma when they beat them old school! Here are pros and cons!Cons-1. Touch screen get in the way and is hard to see and move with some of the time.2. Is not compatible with GBC or GB games3. Only can do multiplayer with DS games4. Extreme lack of games. You should maybe wait another 6 months and get this and the REAL metroid, not just the demo. Mario Kart is coming out in March too.Pro's-1. Picto Chat!2. Great sound, not the static sound of GBA, and GBC3. 2 screens! (sometimes a con)4. Wireless multiplayer!5. For some multiplayer only one game card is needed!6. Is going to show PSP old school!"
5,awsome,the nintendo ds is awsome I got it for my birthday and it is perfect for the car and at home. you can play some GBA games and DS games. It is not hard to learn to use both screens. I think it is much better tham gameboy and you should get it!
5,I fell in love,"With the DS! I played this at a local retail store and I was very impressed with the inventive gameplay! I played a little bit of nintendogs and I really liked how well made the game was. The dogs were so cute, and they behaved like real dogs. there were a lot of fun things to do on the game too, I was impressed. I will definitely buy this around christmas time! I hope this review helped you! :)"
5,da ds is super duper kool!,"this thing is awsome!!! here is pros and cons of the ds compard to the advancenintendo dspros: really fun gamestells u time and datetouch screenif u drop it u dont have to worry about it (trust me i dropped it like, 8 times! )dual screensit can play advance gamesstylus fits in back of the dsit can us the same charger as advancewhen u turn it on it has picto chatand lots more options.wifi connectionwireless ds to ds connectoncons: screen scratcis easily if you dont use stylustwice the size of a gba.styluses easy to losegames too smallgbapros: smallbigger games than dsfuneasyer to useu can still connectcons:games r not too fun.wire connestno toch screenone screenwhen u turn it on without a game the screen just sits there with the words gameboy on itdoesnt tell time. booi definatly reccomend the dsby lissy"
5,It looks great!,"It'll be fun playing my favorite games online in the future. It doesn't look childish and bulky. It's fun playing games with the styles. I haven't boughten one yet, I'm waiting to see if they come out with a black system. It scratches some, but unless your stabbing it with your styles it is not very noticable. It is takes some getting use to looking at two screens. In some games like Wario Touched!, you have to look at both screens for most of the mini-games. I've only played in stores, but it is hard to get away from (unless your waiting for your sister to finish shopping for cloths lol). Overall from what I know Nintendo DS is AWSOME!!!! I'm difinitly getting it."
1,VERRRRRY USED PRODUCT,I am not happy at the way my product was received. I will not buy another used product but I had no idea that I would receive them with a screw missing and scratched up
1,would love to received the item I got a confirmation for!!!,amazon allowed 2 people to purchase one item and It wasnt shipped to me! I was charged later refunded overall screwed. thanks amazon! buyers BEWARE JUST BECAUSE YOU GET A CONFIRMATION AND THEY TAKE YOUR MONEY DOESNT MEAN YOU WILL ACTUALLY GET THE ITEM!
2,DS is for kids.,Have you realize the nintendogs game dosent include pitbulls and Rutwilers? Aint that a sign that says DS is a childrens hand held. Well they would include those dogs if DS were more like PSP. Oh yea Im a guy i wouldnt be wasting my time saying this crap is just that what you losers who waste their time saying PSP sucks is a bunch of crap. Stop writing reviews that DS sucks or PSP suck there arejust 2 handhelds with there own flaws so stop trying to make it a big problem.
5,=p,this game is like gamecube but its portable and games are from n64 and gamecube. the graphics are like gamecube and lots of more cool games are coming like animal crossing ds thats from gamecube but got modifyed so dont think Ds is just like a gameboy advanced cause its not
5,DS is better!!!!!!,"Ok, listen up. For starters the games are cartridges not discs. They are similar to gamecube memory cards only thinner. The DS should be a hit. I'm getting it for Christmas. A game I want for it is Super Mario 64x4, aka Super Mario 64 DS. Another great game for it is Puppy Times. You raise up to 3 adorable pups.On to features: Duel screens (backlit for dark area play), a touch screen, microphone, FREE wireless communication, wireless game sharing, 3D capabilities, new buttons, excellent sound system, Good battery life (yes, rechageble), two good processors, the game chips (new media), duel slots, different languege capabilities, embedded pictochat software that enables up to 16 users to chat at once, real-time clock, date, time, alarm, and touch screen calibration. Now, does the PSP have all that? No. It comes with some free software including pictochat. Now I don't have anything against sony, there a good company. But let's face it, DS is BETTER."
3,Nintendo DS,"The Nintendo DS is a unique system. Those who purchase the console are looking for a new and innovative handheld. Through its myriad of features, consumers see this as the future of gaming. Wrong- The DS's key feature, its touch screen, is unbelievably awkward to use. Furthermore, there seems to be no concrete reason for the inclusion of two screens.Games such as 'Super Mario 64 DS' exploit the system's features, yet the lack of a true analogue pad undermines their effort. Despite these significant problems, the touch screen does have potential. At this time, however, it seems every developer is keen on adding touch screen functions for the sake of novelty. Hopefully, this attitude will change as time progresses.Key Features*Two LCD screens*Clamshell design*Touchscreen"
2,Yes you can.,"You can download DS games on the PSP. You dont need a touch screen just to play it. Trust me, if you can homebrew, you can do anything to get games. You guys just domt know it. I got Coded Arms without the UMD on my memory stick and it's the full game. Guys its possible"
4,A GOOD TOY BOB21,There are two different colors of Nintendo DS. They are red blue and silver and pink . We like the DS. Because there are many good games we also like it because there is a 2nd screen that is a touch screen one of my good games are called Warrior war touched.Chris Z Ryan B Holand P.A.
2,HUH? WHAT IS THIS? NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR!!!!,"Wow Nintendo, this was not what I was hoping for. The PSP is SOOOOOOO much better than this piece of junk.pros: Mic.|Touch Screen|2 screens|pictochat|cons: Horrible games|bad graphics|dark screen (you can't see it in the sun!)|Thick|not worth the price|Can you make a better one than the DSL? Can Nintendo bring the DSI to the US? I hope than I would take all I said back. I have a Wii to and it has bad graphics. Dude, guys. If you want a good game console than get a XBOX360 or a PS3 or a PSP."
2,All of you people who say PSP sucks.,"You guys are just a bunch of NintenDORKS. Losers who thinks DS will Beat PSP all the way. Youre wrong. Next year the games for the PSP are going to get better. And nintendo will be a thing in the past(like it already has been). And when you get the DS and finally realize PSP is better, you will feel like a NintenDORK"
3,nice little system,it is a good system. But people are saying that psp gets dead pixels more than ds but i got one on my ds :( on the touchscreen.the games stink they need more games like james bond.
4,A review on the DS,"I have played my friends DS and it is superior to what I have seen on the PSP.First of all, dont sell your GBA SP to get this as it can not play Game Boy Color or lower games.It CAN play GBA games and produces richer colors than the GBA could, but the DS can not link GBA games. The DS has TWO screens unlike other handhelds.The bottom screen can be touched with the included stylus for added fun.The DS automatically can chat with other systems nearby and chat using the on screen keyboard and by drawing pictures wirelessly!!You may also use the wireless feature to play specially marked games that other DSs nearby are playing.Overall, the DS is a superb gaming system that every child should have and is defiinitly worth the $149.99 price tag."
5,WarriorIng i agree.,Ok first of all WarriorIng i agree if we buy psp's nintendo will fail but if we buy ds's nintendo will succeed. We need nintendo to succeed otherwise we will have lost the greatest gamemakers in the world. I live in the UK and my bro got the ds off the uk nintendo site via being a VIP i played it and i love the ds come on everyone join WarriorIng to help the ds succeed.
5,Every Parent should Know.......,"First off i want to say wow! i am a 16 your old boy who could care less a about video game systems. The Nintendo DS first caught my attention with its sleek silver design. also the dual screen is amazing. I hope u parents think about this because it will help. The nintendo DS has many goood/bad things about it firstGood:- small- cheep (best buy, target, circuit city etc. $149)- keep teens buisy- good for road trips or anytime- even parents like it( i let 4 parents try it out and they liked it expesioully the game Super Mario 64)- many games- full color dual screenBad:- controlls are hard (at first)- more games come out after christmas.Im telling you parents, if you are having trouble finding your teens a gift, get them the nintend DSfineprint- some games are vilent so i reccomend this for older teens (14-20)"
3,Excelent service,"Just want to start by saying that the fast rate at which the DS was shipped was a plus for your company and it was in perfect condition when it arrived,so that is another plus for you all guys.I didn't purchase it for myself but for one of my god children so my ratings might not be all accurate.Other than that everything was cool."
5,A great and original game system.,"I have the ds and it is great. It plays gba games, which is cool. It has great durability. Surround sound and best of all a touch screen! The chat features is also amazing. The ds is not a bad system at all and with exciting new games along the way, the ds should be checked out."
3,Hey yo what's the Deal?,Why is this system back in stock I think Amazon.com or other stores worldwide let us know when this system is back in stock okay!
2,Nintendo DS is a bust,"I am highly dissapointed with the Nintendo DS. All the games that are currently out for the system are sub par at best and the graphics are nothing to smile about. The D-pad is a little too small and usuing the stylus for controlling a character in Mario 64 DS is worthless. Anyone who thinks the DS has better graphics then the PSP has obviously needs to go to www.gamespot.com and just look at some pictures. I am not a PSP fanboy, its just that the DS was rushed into the market and so were the games, if you see the poor graphics of Madden football and its terrible frame rate. I admit animal crossing and mario kart DS will be fun games, but its sad that your ""heavy hitter"" games are already on the gamecube, and will not be that much differnt, and of course the graphics will not be as good. I would not reccomend buying the DS untill PSP comes out, so you can see what both have to offer."
5,lots of fun for anyone even my grandma likes it,i just got one i think like 2 weeks ago. and it's so so so so soo much fun.i had took it to my grandma's house the 3rd day i had got it...she didn't give it back to me until the end of the day.and she didn't want to give it to me i let her borrow it though.she still has it she love the nintendogs game i like it too.she plays it good too.for a old lady with atheritis.this game is so totally cool.
3,Nintendo comes through!,"Despite what others say, the DS is not just a new Game Boy, but the next generation in handheld gaming. Its wireless abilites far surpass that of the Game Boy Advance SP adapter, which allows only a 10 yard radius, and kind of makes the SP more clunky. the capibilities of this wireless system, however, will have a 100 foot radius. the bottom touch screen is not nessesary but useful, allowing room for real-time maps and game stats. Overall, this is an amazing device and i thing Nintendo has come through quite nicely if you ask me."
4,This is fun but...,"I should add that I received this as a Christmas gift one year from one of my relatives and I really enjoy it.I really won't be able to do an actual review on this thing until Pokemon Diamond and Pearl come out in April. However, I do have one of the games in the Nintendogs Series so I can do my review based on that. This is a fun system, but I almost want to switch to a DS Lite, being as this is more heavier than that is. I just saw a picture of the DS Lite just now, and it looks like the controls (like your on/off switch) are set differently than the DS. I still like this though because you can play GBA games on here, the screen is brighter than it is on the GBASP, which is a big plus. I should just be lucky that I even got a DS though, because if I hadn't, and we got the two Pokemon games I mentioned earlier, than I wouldn't have been able to play them. I still recommend this, but I'd recommend the DS Lite even more..."
4,Written by stan. A review on wi-fi,Wi-fi connection on the ds is good. The online is FREE. You can play from regional to rivals (people that have the same skill as you) to world-wide. The problem is it takes a long time to find people. For example in Mario Kart DS it took me about what felt like a minute or two to find someone. The players online are ridiculas. They're awsome.Even when you pick a rival. So if you are not very good at video games really your only chance is to find an amateur. The hotspots are usually local mcdonalds. It's kind of weird that you can only play at home or in hotspots but NOT on the road.
4,Cool,"Yes, this handheld game is cool and touching really is good, lol. The only thing i really don't like is the Pictochat, it makes no sense u have to be in the same room with the person. I mean u could just talk to them inside of writing. If it would work from like a mile away that would really be cool. But overall good and the stylus is fun to use and much easier. I am in control with the touch screen. Buy it!love, Juls123"
5,Nintendo DS,"This toy is set for release on November 21, but Nintendo has already reported 2 million units pre-ordered, twice what was expected. Is it that good? I think it is. New and never before seen features include a microphone, a touch screen, wireless multiplayer function, among others. It would make a great Christmas present to anyone."
5,A Must Have!,"This device is a MUST HAVE for anyone! It has a built in back light, awesome color varieties, and the BEST games! First of all, if you have, or will get a Nintendo DS, you need to get Animal Crossing:Wild World, and the Wi-Fi USB connector along with it! You can buy the USB connector right here on Amazon.com! And Animal Crossing too! For more info about these accessories, just type them in the search box above! Nintendo DS's system can play both Nintendo DS games, and Gameboy Advance games also! If your child wants this, I recommend getting getting it. He/she will be playing it for hours! Plus, the prices went down since the game system came out, so it's cheaper now!My Opinion:I'd rather have one of these, than a PSP!"
1,The real Facts,"OK here it goes, if you are a little nintendo fan-boy, look away, and go read some little nintendo fan-boy's reviews. But lemmme give all the strong people the bare facts. The nintendo DS delivers graphics a little better than the N64, but listen, 70% of the games I have played, delivered less than N64 quality, some games even have GBAV quality. This would be a good buy for a starting out gamer or someone under 12. But listen, all of the games get boring TRUST ME. The comunnicaters are worthless unless you know someone else that has one. Listen my friends, go out and save up $150 more and buy your self a PSP, it is directed towards 13-30 year olds and you can do alot more. The graphics are great. Take this advise please.. and also end the developement of Pokemans games.. Please"
1,WHAT?!,How can you be comparing the DS to the PSP?? Everyone is saying that the DS is better. OF COURSE IT'S BETTER!! The PSP has only been released in Japan!!
1,Do Not buy This Honestly!,Do not buy this because this is one of the worst systems that Nintendo Has ever made. It's just this system sucks! I mean the Gameplay isn't any good! The games are stupid on this and this system really sucks! If you are looking for a new handheld buy the PSP (Playstation Portable) Instead of this stupid piece of Junk System!
1,YOU SHUT UP,"Why should I buy the psp when I Could buy the better system the ds,the psp games are boring,but ds games are awesome.You and your [..] psp fanboys should shut up.I dont care how many games the psp games are 75% of them will [..] like psp.you dont know what your missing on! NINTENDO ROCKSGOD BLESS!"
2,SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST,"[...] I get 3 gaming magazines a month, so i have done my research. If your in need of a new handheld than i gues this is one to consider, it has nice control, N-64 graphics, and a touch screen,Although while considering this u should taken into account the games it has. If your in the 9th grade and up, you might be a lil disappointed with the games for launch. My dad has already bought my sisters one each, and they are 8 and 11, so they should have fun. But i plan on waiting for the psp,(just a couple of months) cuz i am 17 and want a handheld with a variety of games and not to mention insane graphics(making it hard to pick the ps2 from the psp graphics, u can check any website.)So good luck making ur choice, and if i didnt help enough then there others...Oh and one more thing ...THE DS DAYS ARE NUMBERED CUZ ONCE THE PSP DROPS IT WILL TAKE OVER THE HANDHELD DEVISION JUST LIKE THEY DID WITH THE CONSOLE DEVISION. had to get that off my chest lata screenname is ashi randi 34."
2,DS,"Graphics- 6/10Durability- 7/10Screen Quality- 1/10 (Why the heck do you need two screens...it's a gameboy...)Games---~OR SHOULD I SAY MARIO~- 3/10 (Wow MARIO! can't nintendo get over Mario, he is old, and boring, all the games are GameCube games that were just re-made and gave a different name)Fun- -5/10 (YES NEGATIVE. When I played this at K-Mart, it made me feel like an idiot. This part cracks me up, you don't need a touch screen to have fun, plus, when all of those kids touch screen dies and gets ripped up they are gonna go crazy)Overall- 2.4 STARSP.S.- All this system does is make it so you have NO life and have no freinds except for Wario, Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad and Bowser.If you don't like having freinds...go for it."
1,YOUR RIGHT!,Blood and violence dont make a game! I cant stand this! Everyone thinks of a shooter as being a blood fest! That aint true. Battlefront 2 doesnt have blood. Battlefield 2 modern combat doesnt have blood. And I think socom has options. Graphics dont make a game..........but it sure helps! Look at GBA SW3 and DS SW3 they both have same graphics that suck! Now look at SW Battlefront 2 on PSP that looks better than the PS2 version!!! See the difference??!! WOW NINTENDOGS!!!!!!!!5 YEAR OLDS DREAM! Who would make a pointless simulator of dogs?! Get a real dog.P.S.DS SUCKS
3,Pretty Good,"This show was pretty good, but not nearly as good as SuperRetardo. His earlier work was much better. Some of the jokes here are a bit too easy and played out. A few good laughs here and there, but it kinda drags on at times."
2,Repetition,I was not offended by Mitch's humor. I was more offended in that I listened on Youtube and Pandora to him and thought by purchasing the dvd I would be getting some new material. Mitch's deliver makes his humor work. I was bored by the fact that he has the same jokes in all of his materias. Save money and just youtube him.
5,Absolutely delightful,"The movie is from Rohmer series of proverbs, and it is very kind and charming. For me, it was a story of a young girl coming out of age, about a conflict between her determination to achieve a goal despite all odds by trying to manipulate others and how life unfolds to shock the her that other people's emotions are not simple matter. What I love about Rohmer's films is the kindness and warmth that radiates, although the stories are somewhat melancholic. I wish movies like this be done nowadays, too, without that garish vulgarity that blights modern cinema.This is not for Hollywood lovers, therefore."
5,Slip into Cinnamon,"If you are looking to slip into something a little more comfortable than Altoids (shocking cinnamon), then the oral fixation cinnamon flavor may suit your mood. I'll admit I like the container even more than the mints and yet, the mints are still cinnamony enough to get my attention.~The Rebecca Review"
1,Doesn't do the job,This mini fridge I got to keep cream cold for coffee. It doesn't work well at all. Does not keep the cream cool enough. If it wasn't such a hassle I'd try to get my money back.
2,Spend your money on a tarp,"Although not really expensive,this plastic ground cover is not worth the price. On it's first use, this relatively light weight plastic ground cover developed holes from the slightly uneven ground surface at the campsite (small rocks and roots, which are quite normal for most campsites). If I had it to do again, I would not purchase this product but would instead put the money to better use by buying either a 6-mil piece of heavy duty plastic or by purchasing a heavier duty tarp. Happy trails!"
1,Not worth the money **,"Nothing wrong with the product. But NOT WORTH the $$$. Just go to wal-mart or any such stores, and buy a tarp ** $ 5 to $ 10 does the job, plus the tarp is stronger, and has multiple uses."
3,Kinda thin,I expected something a bit thicker for $30. Other than that - it is what it is: an 11 foot square plastic sheet.
2,Wouldn't do it again!!!,"Not sure just what this Floor Saver is supposed to do but can't imagine that it does much. Used it one time on a 4 day trip in a relatively good smooth camp site. This floor saver looked as though it had been run through the mill with minimal traffic. Bought a heavy weight tarp for $12.00 at a local store for my next trip, seems a lot more sturdy."
3,Buy a tarp,Nothing wrong with product but I was expecting something better. I thought the product would be thicker. I will buy a tarp next time.
3,Quality matches the price,"The recommendation to get a Floor Cover for my new Eureka tent was a great recommendation. The price was very reasonable however the quality is only fair. Depending on the terrain you are camping on, rocks and other ground debris causes quick wear on the cover. Fortunately we have not camped in a major downpour yet so unable to rate effectiveness on that point."
1,Waste of Money!!,"Nothing more than a glorified trash bag, the packaging it comes in is twice as thick as the product. Put the money towards a tarp..."
3,I like it,"I like this song. It expresses a lot of emotion, like most songs are meant to express emotion. However, as many other people did say, the cussing took away from a lot of it. I heard the edited version on the radio, and I think it's better when it's edited. Then I heard the unedited version, and I think I like the cuss words bleeped out better.In general, this is just a good song. But it's all a matter of opinion. Some people who are offended by cussing should get the edited version, and as for those who aren't, they could just listen to the unedited. Overall, I think it's a good song."
5,I love this song,"wow...this song is really good. even though he uses the F word A LOT it didn't really turn me off like most songs that use it a lot do. i just love his voice and the beat of this song...the music is beautiful. this song just made me feel like i knew exactly how he felt, and that's what good music does. i think that whoever the girl that screwed him over was she's a fricken idiot! anyways, great song! i love it!"
1,Is this guy for real?,"I was seriously ""LMAO"" when I first heard this track. Who does this assclown think he is? Seriously. Like some others have mentioned, all I hear is Mickey Mouse crying throughout this entire song. People review this song with 5 stars thinking he's some kind of ""groundbreaking"" artist who ""speaks the truth"". Give me a break. This kid has no talent in singing or song-writing and I don't know how he got into the music business. He probably sucked off an A&R. I do admit the beat is catchy and I'll be waiting for another R&B singer to carry it right."
1,"serioulsy, F*** this song","such poetic genius in this song such as ""I admit I'm sad, it hurts real bad..."" and the shakespearian chorus repeated many times, ""f*** you you ho i don't want you back."" C'mon, give me a break, anybody could write this crap. The swearing every 15 seconds is just terrible. The song has a good beat to it, but the lyrics just make it unbearable to listen to. You can't help but to laugh at this guy instead of feeling sorry for him as his goal was."
4,Simple but blunt,"I have to admit when I first heard this song, I thought it had a nice beat and Eamon's voice was decent. I continued listening to the lyrics and was surprised. It was funny and at the same time real. The lyrics are without a doubt simple, but I think thats the point. Its a straightforward song about how a man's emotions after a break up. You have to praise him for being so blunt and honest."
1,LOL!,Is this is joking right?No I'm serious...Pharell sings better than this guy..unlike him at least Pharell's crooning sounds pretty decent..This is a guy who would probably yell when him and his girl are making love..he would make more noise than his other half???No..
1,"Try again...or better yet, never.","The song F*** It, I Don't Want You Back, should be nominated for the worst single of 2004. This wannabe R&B ballad is laced with expletives, bitterness, and simplistic, brain-dead rhymes. Yes, Eamon tries something new by putting angry gangsta lyrics in a R&B ballad, but it just doesn't work here. The song is nothing more than the ranting of a naive young man's first serious relationship that failed. These lyrics are best left in someone's private diary. If you want angry lyrics, then listen to Eminem, as he is a much more talented songwriter and performer."
1,I'm the REAL Eamon,"my name is also eamon, and i was playing music long before this punk was even born. i write songs that convey more feeling that ""wah wah, i don't like you anymore"". the depth of emotion shown by this artist is appallingly shallow. what's his next song gonna be? ""F***, i want my blankey"" what a herb, and that's the word from the herd of big bird, ait!"
5,Its Honesty at its best,"Yes the cursing was a little over the top, and the voice could be a little better. But the lirycs (mispelled probably) blew the crap out of me. This is what every person thinks when they are screwed over, he just put it in an R&B song with a good hook. Like I said, honesty at its best."
3,Weird...,"Ok this song starts out SO awesome, beautiful melody & all and the first verse is fine, then the chorus comes and throws you completely off, what's the deal with all the f**k's?You usually like a song because it makes you feel a certain way, this song starts as a great sappy song that you're gonna gush over and feel all happy but the lyrics just don't fit!!!So it annoys me that I hear the beginning of the song and I go ""oh I love this song"" then it's ""oh it's THAT song""So my thing is......I Love the song, but I still hate it, the lyrics don't fit the song!!!But either way, I wanna hear more stuff from this guy..."
5,funny,"Everyone else who wrote a review is a f*cking moron. This song is f*cking HILARIOUS and shouldnt be viewed in any other way. Stop taking it so f*cking seriously, you f*cking ho."
5,Finally someone says it,"Eamon is so brazen it's amazing. He says what you really feel when your heart is crushed. Finally a real true break up song that says what no one else would. Even though I'm female it's nice to hear a break up song from a guy expressing himself. You can't hear it and not sing along, it's like he's reading your mind if you've gone through a break up like that. He may have lost his great one but he'll be one in his own right."
1,Unimaginative,"I'm sorry, but I just can't like this song. If you look past everything else and look at the meaning of the song. There's something there. He's pissed off for being screwed over in a relationship. It's a good thing to sing about, but the gratuitious swearing is a little much. There's nothing wrong with the word F***. The thing is though, when it's used in every phrase of a song (or at least in the chorus) the word loses its meaning, its impact, it's power. On the same token, i think the lyrics are pretty unimaginative (""F*** you, you ho""). If he could find a way to say that differently, possibly in a more poetic type of way, I might like the song more. So, basically, this song is trash."
3,F*** This Song,"The song is good but the swearing takes away from this song soooo much. I cannot emphasize this enough. I don't know if he thinks he is hard or ballin' cuz he says that, but it ain't kickin. I understand it's the truth or whatever, but you don't need to say F**k in every line of the chorus or call this girl a ho. I know it's an explanation of feelings, but at some points, I'm just not feelin it."
1,THIS is the song everyone is talking about?,"I saw a few reviewers say that this song is the only good song on the album. If that's the case, then there's really no hope for this guy because this song isn't even remotely decent. Aside from the ridiculous lyrics, Eamon's singing is so horrid that I heard this song playing on the radio and I couldn't tell if it was a man or a woman singing. If you have a child that needs to be punished, having him/her listen to this song would be worse than getting a spanking.Anthony Rupert"
5,!!!!!great song!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"first off mark.....you say you live in rome,new york NEVER HEARD OF ITIf anyone is a wannabee is youyour review was horrible and if you knew where eamon was fromBELIEVE ME there is no wannabees in THE hometownTHIS SONG IS F**KIN HILARIOUS!!!!!!!!!oh and MARK.... if you came to shaolin your ass would get waxedSCRUB......"
1,Not good,"I'm 19 and im not too ""uptight"" when it comes to swearing. I don't understand why he must use swear words to get his point across, is he not smart enough to think of a better word? but then again if your music sucks this bad I guess you have to do something to make it sell."
5,Catchy,"When I first heard this song I was wondering if the lyrics were exactly as I heard them, but after time, I started to like it. I found more humor in the song myself just because of the contrast of the lyrics and the slow beat, yet at the same time, the beat sets the mood of the song. If you look at this song and judge it solely by the profanity, then I'd say you will probabaly despise the song. Now I can't say you will like Eamon's voice either. Not many people can truly sing though...just go to a karaoke bar, you'll see what I mean. All in all, I think it's a great song, and it's one of a kind in it's own class. I can't recall any songs in the past which go into a story like the one in this song, and the artist just gets as blunt as raw emotion would go."
1,Sucks,"Ok.. I admit, this guys voice is ok. Its kinda weird, but nice to listen to. He can sing. The song sounds really sad, and it starts off like ""I cared about you, you meant a lot to me, I wanted to tell you how I feel, Im sad this happened"" then suddenly changes to ""F**k this, f**k that, f**k you, you ho"", ect. The song would be 10 times better without the swearing. He was saying how much this girl meant to him.. and he seemed sad, but now hes talking all this sh*t because she cheated on him. I mean, is it just me.. or is it stupid when he says ""Those gifts I gave you, throw them away, and the kisses didnt mean jack""? If those kisses/gifts he gave her while he was with her didnt mean anything, then he was sending her false emotions. No wonder she cheated on him."
1,Worst,"This is the worst song I have ever heard in my life. This further proves why I should become a singer because this guy has no talent and neither do I, as far as singing. If he can come out with this crap, so can I, and I'm cuter. I thought Mark Morrison's Return of the Mack was trash, but I can tolerate that, but this mess, NO! Why this song has gained so much popularity may just be because of the bashing that most people can relate to after being in bad relationships, but goodness, that voice, if you can even call it that is such a disgrace! Who signed this guy?"
1,Lasted a day,"I used this card with a SanDisk ImageMate USB 2.0 reader/writer and a Palm Tungsten T3 (with the SD patch applied). After a day of use, the card was no longer recognized by the Palm or PC. I've returned the card. I'm going to try the equivalent Panasonic SD card."
3,sandisk 256mb sd secure digital memory cards problem?,"I use the Sandisk 256mb sd secure digital memory cards in my Kodak cx7430, and have noticed that some pictures disappear from time to time. The real problem (mystery) is that some pictures OCCASIONALLY make what was white or yellow or the blue sky to be PINK, or the picture comes out as very dark even thou the flash did flash. Is it the memory or the camera? I don't know, but suspect the memory. I have heard of other reports of cameras malfunctioning with the card."
3,woodcarver,"I'm not totally satisfied with the woodcaver tool. It is too aggressive for my use & taste. It is less aggressive than the chain saw type discs I have tried, but still aggessive & grabby (dangerous). I like the tooth design, but would think, as on a chain saw chain, the ""depth guage"" could be modified to lessen the depth of cut. The guy I learned about the woodcarver from likes his. I think his work is not as craftsmanship oriented as mine. He is also about 1/3 my age."
4,Works fine...,Bought these for use with my Canon DC-40 camcorder. Compatible and works fine without any issues.
5,Works well,No problems were encountered with this product. I use these discs to provide a storage medium for music that is small enough to slip into my pocket.
3,SEE THEM LIVE!!!,"As much as I love the band, this CD does not live up to Boulevard and Blue Cafe's caliber. It took them 4 years to follow up on Blue Cafe but it's mostly mediocre, middle of the road rockabilly tunes that they came up with. It's best to experience HRL live in San Diego or in RAB fairs, hootenannies and car shows. But if you're a die-hard... it's still worth owning."
2,"fantastic book, bad Kindle version","I downloaded the sample of the book with my kindle. The book is very interesting and reader friendly, but the Kindle version is really unusable and, sometime, it's impossible to understand te relationship between formulas and text. In addition I expected to have some features easy to provide with the electronic format such as hypertext, pops-up and similar not present in the book. Also the text to speech is not available. Kindle is the worst purchase I have never done.I am really interested in the book but I will not buy the kindle version for the reasons above"
2,"Great Instructional Value, Terrible Quality DVD",The DVD skips and stops midway through on every DVD player I've tried it on. It was from a sealed box and I'm pristine in my treatment of DVDs so I have no idea why it won't finish. I was highly disappointed.
1,Not what I was expecting.,"I thought there would be more tips and tricks and more organizational techniques. What I got from this book, I was able to find for free on line. Not a lot of cross-country moving suggestions. More focused on in-town moves, in my opinion."
3,A disk?,This book comes with a floppy disk!! I havent had a computer that could read a floppy in years. Most of this book is very obvious. It would have been wonderful to have it digitally so that I could cut and paste the helpful parts.
5,dose of psychotic thriller,"scarred from a painful past experience and filled with hate, tamara can speak to dolls and her dead mother in plotting the demise of her soon-to-be step-siblings and step-mother. she joins forces with a murdering sex maniac to break the bonds between her father and step-mother while taking joy in seeing those she hate suffers. filled with incest, psychologically twisted thinking, and a need to win at these devious schemes. d.a. fowler writes a memorable landscape where you can feel the iciness of tamara's mind and her 'friend' with benefits. read this novel and root for tamara's victory.also read the prequel, ""what's wrong with valerie."""
1,COLLAR DID NOT WORK,"I ORDERED THIS COLOR AND ALSO THE FOGGER PER THE ADVICE OF MY VET BECAUSE MY PET HAS A NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER. DESPITE THE FACT THAT I HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS THAT FLEA COLLARS ARE COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE, MY VET TOLD ME THAT THIS PRODUCT WOULD WORK. NEEDLESS TO SAY, IT DID NOT, AND I AM JUST TRYING TO SAVE OTHER CONSUMERS FROM WASTING MONEY."
1,Disappointed,I am very disappointed with this product. I purchased two of these collars after reading some great reviews. My cats have had them on for less than a month and they now have fleas.
5,Wonderful,My indoor/outdoor cat has been with me for 4 years. Usually she'd get maybe one tick a month and I'd just pull it off. This past fall she got many ticks and I couldn't keep up with them - she'd have 10 at a time. I made her sleep in the basement then I'd see them crawling around - it was awful. So i tried Frontline on her neck - it did not work - AND the vet told me I had to wait 30 days before trying a collar because of the chemicals in Frontline and the collar combined could be bad. I waited 20 days- then I couldn't wait anymore. I put this collar on her and presto - no more ticks - it was magic. She wore it from the end of November to early feb when it came off- I think she got in a fight and it came off - but I still smell it on her. I'm buying a new one today because it's warming up outside. I can't say enough good about this collar- it ended a nightmare for me and Choochie.
4,The most energetic CD I own...,"This CD is amazing. My RealJukebox defines it as Folk, but really it's more of Celtic/French/Jazz/everything. I played this in my music class and not one person didn't like it. The singing is almost as good as the instrumentals, though one track (Le Chanson de Mathurin, I think) is so annoying that it brings my rating of this CD down to a four star. My advice: skip track 4, and this will be one of your all-time favorites."
4,Toot Toot,I am a grandmother of a 17 month old grand-daughter and thought the Wiggles Toot Toot was very good. It was educational also showing how you look both ways before crossing the street in the singing and dancing. All the Wiggles are always very colourful and lots of movement with the dancing. I recommend this DVD to anyone and really haven't come across any of the DVD's that weren't worth the money.
5,The Wiggles are amazing,"to toddlers. We just got this CD in the mail yesterday, and my 17 month old daughter couldn't wait to listen to it. She ran with the CD to the stereo. She danced from start to finish. This CD has a lot of the songs from her Wiggle Time video so she really was excited to dance along, and amazingly I enjoy singing and dancing with the Wiggles also. I highly recommend this CD for anyone looking to purchase Wiggle music."
5,More Wiggles to listen to!,"My daughter is 7 and is a huge Wiggles fan! She received this album as a Christmas present and just loves it. It features songs from the TV series so she's able to do the dances as she listens, well I have to do them with her, but hey, it's great exercise!! The Wiggles have great voices and can write some pretty catchy songs. The songs are easy to remember so kids really get a kick out of singing them. Buy this and enjoy!"
1,Practical?,"If you are teaching or learning EKG's this is not the book for you! Although this book is initially inviting because of the color (it is much easier to measure strips on colored ECG paper) the measurements in the back are wrong in the appendix and are confusing to learners. This book also does not have ""beginning"" strips to learn, or typical strips for that matter. There are limited examples (50) to identify and that is NOT sufficient for learning ECG's. With the price of this book I would highly suggest another choice...any choice for that matter."
4,easy reading,I had to buy this book as a textbook for one of my nursing classes. It was easy to read. There were many EKG strips quizes. I think it is a good book for students who are just starting to study EKG.
3,It will get you by,"This book was mandatory for our nursing class so I didn't have a choice. It will give you the basics on how to identify various strips, but it didn't seem to ""teach"" me the inner workings of how to read an EKG strip. I had to get my classmates to show me exactly where to find things, such as an ST elevation, on real strips because real strips are the perfect strips you see in the book."
2,About the seller,"Sorry, I have yet to recieve the item I ordered. So I cannot give it a fair review. But the seller has yet to return my emails and it has already been a month since I have order this item."
5,Wonderful and mellow,"I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes the sound of singers like Jennifer Knapp, Sarah McLauglin, and Ginny Owens. The songs on this CD are soft and mellow with inspiring messages that one can really relate to. She isn't very in your face with her message and her songs convey the struggles and honest questions many Christians deal with in their faith lives."
2,Disappointing!,"I heard All Right Here before Conversations, though Conversations came out first. While I'm glad to see that Sara grew and evolved into something wonderful (All Right Here) and that I heard the better CD first, I'm not impressed with her older works. I would not have picked up any of her other music if I had heard this first.Perhaps I am a rare Christian, but mainstream ""God this/God that"" music doesn't interest me - it all sounds the same, making it feel bland, repetitive, and in a way, depressing. There are some Christian musicians who figure out how to do Christian music right...Jennifer Knapp, for instance. Or Sara Groves in All Right here."
4,less well-known disco classics,"A nice collection of tracks for anyone who's looking for the not so obvious disco of the 70's. The cd contains funky disco like 'Blackwater Gold', more 'cheesy' stuff like 'Come Into My Heart', and tracks as 'Dance To The Drummer's Beat', that nowadays are mostly known by its breaks used in hiphop. More than enough to keep you locked in the groove."
3,Get the quality Sound.....,"The Sound of this CD Produkt is not so good for quality listening.All the Songs are have an very hard pressed Sound, the ""Breaks"" from Catmandu gives the feeling he runs too fast in bpm, all Versions are so extracted, that you are missed a longer running time, you can hear the moments of cutting, when you are waiting for a soft Moment in the Songs, cause there comes shortly the next Action Part in the Music. Factly, that's a nervous feeling in this CD without harmoncal balance in Music.This CD is good to listening rare and sometimes unknown or forgotten old Disco Songs for a few of days, and then you are select your favorite Songs - an now you buying the the Original Quality Records."
2,"Buy Only If You Really, Really Dig George...","....George's Sound is Okay, but he's essentially a one hit wonder. For true fans only."
1,DONT BUY THESE!!!!,"Dont waste your money. I put them in my work boots, tried to slip my boots on, and they rolled out of place, into a ball under my foot. What a joke these are. If 0 stars was an option they would get 0 stars."
3,Complete Book of Wedding Flowers:Stunning Flower Arranging..,I found that this book was not detailed enough for beginners in terms of creating the arrangements. It focused more on the wedding day rather than the actual flower arrangements. I was looking for more of a step-by-step guide for arranging wedding flowers.
3,Not bad - not quite 6 miles though,"They are a good size and the charger is compact. However, not quite sure on the 6 miles as advertised - most channels get static and other people talking at less than 1 mile away."
4,Great Value,These radios are perfect for use within a comercial or industrial site. Very inexpensive but durable and reliable.
3,"less than adequate range, and inferior sound quality.","Struggles to transmit through a stone building 100 meters away, with large glass windows!1/2 mile range in open areas.poor audio quality from speaker. must constantly request a repeat of message. Comparing to my Panasonic FRS units.Good battery life, and user replaceable.Can't seem to get VOX to work...poor user manual...tried 3 and 4 conductor headsets with it. No joy.Primarily used as kid monitor/parent-to-child two-way communicator."
4,Great for the price!,"I purchased this product to use on a cruise to stay in contact with our 17 year old son...they worked GREAT!! We use these ALL the time! Not only for the ship, (got pretty good reception through all the metal and concrete, etc.) but while we were at port, theme parks, the mall, shopping strips, sporting events...I could go on and on!The only down side is the the lower channels don't get as good reception. The farther away you get from each unit, the poorer the reception, which is only to be expected. We paid $29 for our set, and feel we have gotten more than our money's worth! We haven't tested the exact distance, but they work well enough for us as far as we've gone!We love these radios, and will use them till they fall apart, and that my friend, seems like it will be a long time from now!"
4,Excellent summary of the state of the client/server industry,"This is an excellent ""Get me caught up quick"" book on client server technology and Iwould recommend it for anyone who has been in mainframeland and wants to get aperspective on the C/S paradigm. I enjoyed the easy fluid style of presentation.This book is an investment."
4,Perfect for Little Girls,"I ordered this Karaoke CD for my 9 year old daughter. Sheloves singing the songs from some of her favorite Disney movies.This is the perfect CD for any little girl who loves to sing, and perfect for any Mom who is sick of hearing the same old Karaoke CD's with Britney Spears ""Oops I did it Again"".When I ordered the CD I took a chance because there was no information on the song selection. It's perfect for both my 9yr old and my 3yr old who also loves to sing along with her big sister.The CD selection are; 1-Just Around the Riverbend 2-Part of Your World 3-Beauty and the Beast 4-Colors of the Wind 5-Reflection 6-He's a Tramp 7-A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes 8-Part of the Heart of the Sky. The first 8 songs are the instrumental versions followed by 8 vocal versions of the same songs."
3,Odd selection of songs for kids.,"The musical selection is not as familiar to a six year old as some of the classical Princess Songs. Their initial frustration of not being able to follow the songs or relate to the music will pass the more it is used, but this lack of familiarity may cloud their enjoyment of the Karaoke system for quite awhile.This is not a flaw in the CD, which is quite good with easy to follow words and beats. I should have listened to the songs closer in order to judge whether the younger children would know them. I figured Princess Songs -- voila! Perfect.Overall, I'm sure this is a great CD for eight year olds and up."
2,Not what I expected,"Okay...if you're familiar with the songs, you know what you're getting, but these are not all the songs that stick in your head when you watch a Disney film. These are not the songs playing at the theme park when you go there. No ""Bippity Boppity Boo"" no ""Be Our Guests"" no ""Kiss the Girl"" or ""Under the Sea."" All slow, and not catchy. Not the song collection my daughter would like the best."
5,received as requested!,Bought early for granddaughter. She is 4 years old. I wrapped it for Christmas and she was so happy when she opened her Christmas gift.
2,Why Disney printed this??????,"I don't know why. When I saw he cover of this album, I thought it would be perfect, but when I bought it, I was very disappointed! Because this album was not very different from the album ""Sing-along with Disney Princess"", many tracks were the same! If you want a cuter cover, buying this one will be better. If you want to listen to the tracks only, you'd better buy the cheaper one, ""Sing-along with Disney Princess""."
2,Disney quiet-oke!,My daughter will not use the CD. It's pretty boring for a 6 year old. It's pretty poor choice of music. Maybe it will work out better for older girls?!
