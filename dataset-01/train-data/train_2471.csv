4,A whole new view of the courts,"I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in law, the constitution, or the courts and how they affect society.This presents a very interesting view of the courts and how they shape, and are shaped by, society. Whether you agree with his aims or not, it's an interesting read and presents an interesting legal strategy that conservatives could employ. Particularly interesting were how many of the social issues of the day evolved to where they're at now by a long-standing liberal plan of action and how lawsuits are frequently used with no hope of winning, but with every intention of strategic gain.I think he could have made his (very good) points in slightly shorter order -- a couple of times I feared that I had lost my place. The readability/believability also suffers a bit since he highlights the impacts of the 2005-2006 political landscape and that has changed significantly.A worthwhile read."
3,If you can't beat them join them.,"The book is interesting. However, I am one of those conservatives who believe in the constitution. I am all for states making decisions on a democratic basis on most issues. I loathe the way liberal justices have imposed liberal policy on us by fiat. Conservatives win elections and Republican Presidents must not compromise on their judicial selections. I believe that there is hope to restore the Judiciary to its rightful roll through judical restraint."
1,2 out of 4 broken within 1st month - warranty useless,"HALF ARE BROKEN NOW! These watches look and feel nice. So, I gave them 4 of them as gifts to very close friends. I have had reports of 2 out of 4 of them breaking within 20 days of giving them as gifts.The warranty from TimeZone123 is unacceptably short given the rate atwhich these watches have failed for me.This is NOT a bargain. I would not recommend purchasing this product."
3,VERY GOOD all rounder mic,"TRY this cheapie for great surprisingly resultsagainst other mics costing double..VERY useable on male and female vocs,acoustic geetar,cellos,orchestra in generaland most all things...wont recommend against elect bass guitar cab...but that is your choice...check out all the other good review s on google tooif you seek a decent condenser less than 150 dollarsthis is a strong contenderthanks"
2,Incomplete Patterns,"There were no top views of any of the many bird patterns in this book.All the fish patterns had top views. I was disappointed and tried to call Al. He provided a phone number in the back of the book and that number was disconnected.If it had top views of the birds like it did for the fish, I would have given it 4 or 5 stars. I carved the catfish and was pleased with how the book walked through that project.I have not carved any of the birds though and that is why I bought this book."
3,Just not as good as expected....,"I had such high expectations of this book because of my love for Little Soul and The Sun. I was so excited to receive it. But I just didn't get the chills and energy I got from the first one. It just seems like a huge complicated subject and it is impossible to encompass all that needs to be said in this short story. It left my son with more questions than answers. It is good, with wonderful graphics....but I don't see myself pulling it off the shelf again and again like I do the first one."
5,This is a Favorite,I can't wait to read this for myself & to my grandchild. It's so inspirational to anyone who reads it
2,disappointed in this one,"Didn't like this book as well as the Little Soul and the Sun. As we had a home birth and this book is all about a baby born into the hospital. Also the book ends abruptly, kind of odd.....like there should be another chapter atleast."
5,Little Soul and the Earth,This book was every bit as good as I expected it to be. Just like the rest of Neale Donald Walsh's writing it is heart warming and uplifting. A joyous read.
4,A little disappointed...,"The message of this book is less powerful compared to The Little Soul and the Sun; but if you want a reminder that ""the angels came with you when you took human birth"", this book illustrates this point fairly well. When I was reading it, I felt like I was going through my own ""birth scene"" again, and inside of me is this, ""OH YES""."
3,Good but not what I expected,"This follow up to The Little Soul And The Sun is a continuation of the adaptation for children of Conversations With God. While I am a big fan of Neale Donald Walsch and his writings, and I was very favorably impressed by the first book in his children series, this one was rather a let down in terms of the storytelling. Although its tough to tell important spiritual truths in the limited amount of pages that you find in a book written for children, Walsch succeeded admirably in the first book of the series so I was expecting more of the same in this one. On the other hand, it does manage to gets its message across so that a child can understand it, and that certainly does count for something. The illustrations are wonderful just as they were in the first book. I rate it a good book but not an exceptional one, although the message is definitely one children need to read or hear and understand."
4,Beautiful but...,"The music and video production on this DVD are very good. Vilayat Khan is an extrordinary and soulful performer. However, the one thing that really annoys me about this DVD is that the Navras logo appears at apparently random points in the music at various places on the screen. THIS IS REALLY ANNOYING! Do they think we don't know who made the DVD, and they have to remind us? This is the only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5. The music is wonderful."
4,terrific sound,"I liked this razor sharp recording a lot (and I own quite a few others). The conducting is excellent in my opinon. The orchestra playes when it should and stops in the breaks.Celibadache's is very good also though not as accessible.Klemperrer's is excellent conducting-wise, but the level of playing is not as good as in this recording.Highly recommended."
3,Educational Manga,"""1 World Manga"" is the story of a young street kid claiming to be studying martial arts under a Master that change his appearance to any animal.This edition, simply titled ""Passage 2 - HIV/AIDS - First Love"", is the next step in Rei's training. But his training doesn't seem to be about martial arts but rather of life as he learns about the harsh facts of HIV/AIDS when he is accepted into the home of a woman named Somalee and meets her little brother and sister - as well her mother, who is dying of AIDS. By helping Somalee's family, Rei learns more about the facts as well as the do's and don'ts of HIV/AIDS.Like book 1, this book has over 30 pages of story plus an additional three pages of facts and info. This story is also aimed for the younger crowd - especially for the pre-High School teenagers."
3,Not Bad,"The book is basically just a survey of photographs in National Geographic Magazine over several decades. Fairly dry and scientifically done stuff, but revealing some quite interesting results regarding how the magazine portrays race, sex, and different cultures."
4,Very informative and interesting.,"Great read for an anthropology class of the late 90s. ""The West"" and ""the rest"" are examined well in terms of race and gender."
2,SO LOUD!,"Bought this clock to hang in my son's nursery. It's a great, simple clock. Looks-wise, it was EXACTLY what we wanted. But the second hand is SUPER loud. We could hear it down the hall, with the door closed. We had to take it down. :("
1,The Music is Beyond Repair,"With one or two isolated exceptions, these compositions are astonishingly boring. If you purchase the recording anyway, be warned that 22 out of 24 tracks are likely to disappoint."
1,Not brand new??,"I got the product yesterday. The bag looked like it was opened and glued back together. I was very hesitant to open it but my dog is running out of food... It is just insane to believe that the original EVO packaging is so bad. It wasn't air-sealed and the top fold looks messy. Again, it looks like some one roll it and glue it together. (like how we would seal it at home!!) This is the first time I got such a bad quality dog food product. VERY disappointed. And I do demand an explanation if the seller cares about their business!! I will not recommend this to anyone."
5,Great dog food!,My rescued Chihuahua had been through 4 differnet kinds of dog food before we tried Innova EVO. He absolutely loves it.
1,Not Well Made,"I was looking for a folding hairbrush to replace a trusty one that I had for over a decade. Since this looked identical, I went for it. But from the first use I could tell the quality was just not there. The bristles do not stay in line when opening/closing and during use, and it has a strong chemical smell that does not seem to improve much over time. It often causes my hair to smell as well. The brush is also difficult to fold/unfold because the rubber base material is very stiff. After a few weeks of use the bristles have already begun to snap off, and the rubber base has completely split (see uploaded image). Considering that I'd been able to use my previous hairbrush for so many years, I'm extremely disappointed that a seemingly identical product would break after only a dozen or so uses."
1,Love the brush but very poorly made,"This collapsible brush is a great idea, but it is very shoddily made. I gave them to three of my granddaughters. The brushes were broken before five minutes were up."
1,No Sale,"Twice I have tried to order this product, and twice my order was canceled with no explanation. I'm trying again, but this is my last effort. I want to give these away in Christmas boxes for poor children, and thought the price was excellent. Hope I actually get them this time!"
3,"Ok, but a strong smell","I'm not sure what the problem is with these brushes, but for some reason they have a strong ""gasoline"" type smell to them. I had previously purchased 6 brushes without the mirrored handle and ended up throwing them away because of the strong smell. I then decided to try this version - with the mirrored handle and while the smell isn't as bad as my previous purchase, it still has a lingering ""gasoline"" type smell to it. Functionally, it works great, folds up small enough to fit in a pocket."
1,chemical odor,This product had a very strong chemical odor that was not removed by washing the product in the dishwasher.I do not recommend this product.
4,"Good enough brush, especially for the money","I'm a guy with long hair and I love having small folding brushes that I can scatter out (car, desk, workbag, etc). These are kind of cheap quality, but for the money, you can't expect much more. They did have a chemical smell, so I just let them air out for a while and it's not a problem. They're a little stiffer than the better ones, but I'm OK with that, too. They come in a variety of colors, so you don't get to select one... if that's a problem for you... it wasn't for me.You're purchasing these based on value, not high quality. BTW - There were 5-6, not 3 as in the item description:-)"
4,Works well but don't buy if your nose is easily offended,"I carry one of these everywhere. I even use one for my everyday brush (I have short hair). I carry spares to the gym and have given them away.But oh, the stink! It fades with use but at first you don't even want to touch them because you wonder if they're toxic. Don't buy if you're careful about chemicals."
5,great imports!!-galore!!,"i just received the cd today and i already think its one of the best alto-rock imports in a while!if you rock-well,get this and rock!simple as that.if you got a few bucks,try out this 1!!"
3,Summer Reading,"For my summer reading assignment i had to read this book for my english class. I thought this book was a good story and i enjoyed most of it, except the ending. I was left thinking, what was going to happen next? I thought it showed very well the difference of an average girl today and a girl in korea during world war two, by telling the reader all the gruesome things that happened to Yoko (the main character who was 11). Overall, i would reccommend this book to a friend and talk about it with other people."
5,Winner with 6th graders,"This book is great. This is a autobiographical count of the journey of a 12 year old girl (Yoko) from Nanam, Vietnam to Japan. She must suffer from starvation and tiredness and Vietnamese soldiers. It is a very touching story. I have had a chance to meet Yoko Kawashima Watkins and her untold stories are just as touching as this book. This book teaches you to appreciate what you have and not to be selfish. This is a great summer reading book and I wouldn't go without reading it."
1,This is like a well written pro-Nazi book,This book is a great read of a fictionalized account of Yoko Watkin's story. There are no bamboos in NK. There were no communist soldiers when Yoko's family left for Japan. And Japanese retreat occurred under heavy military protection. But don't be fooled by the well-written narrative.This book is akin to an escape narrative of an SS officer's family running away from Birkenow Auschwitz concentration camp while the heroin daughter of the Nazi officer is running away from cruel and dangerous Jews freed from concentration camps and Poles. Such a narrative is morally irresponsible and disgusting material to force upon innocent children.Stay away from this book if you value humanity and decency.
1,incredible fabrications of history,"Does she know anything about Japan's wartime history? Just google ""Unit 731,"" the place where her own daddy probably worked at. Is it a pure coincidence that her daddy lived in the area where these despicable, inhuman experiments took place?"
5,A Good Book To Read In Class,I really enjoyed this book. I had to read it in the sixth grade and I was riveted. At some points I found myself close to tears and couldn't stop reading it. My teacher actually met the author and we all got a chance to write a letter to the author. I really enjoy reading about other cultures and this book has still stuck out in my mind as a memorable part of sixth grade.
1,Wholething fabricated,"This book misleads our children to believe wrong history.It's kind of brain wash for our young students.Author claimed her story as survival, now in new book she offers for peace. why?It seems like she just want to hide under the name of peace umbrella without regret."
1,Trash,Don't waste your time on this book. It's full of lies and distorts the truth. The japanese still refuse to apologize for their horrific war crimes/crimes against humanity.
5,a beautifully written book which shows the spirit of a famil,"I had the chance to meet Ms. Kawashima Watkins on 11/29/2000 at Sage Park Middle School in Windsor, CT. The sixth grade team 2/3 presented to Ms. Kawashima Watkins a panotime opera of skits relating to her book. My daughter Lauren was involved in the Shoe Shine scene where she played the violen trying to solicite money from the gentlemen. It was the last act and it was a great scene. Yoko autographed the playbill for us. My mom, myself and Lauren were humbled by her experiences. The book: So Far From the Bamboo Grove is rated a 5 for one of the best books I ever read with my daughter.Recommened for all children 9 and up, and adults.Theresa Grottole"
3,This book was OK!,"This book was good, but I don't think it was as good as it's sequel, ""My Brother, My Sister, and I"". It wasn't as interesting as the sequel either. But it basically had the same plot as the sequel. In both stories, they had to flee from their homes and live in a place worse than where they used to live. Then they would search for someone that they loved and missed very much and that was part of their family. I also wanted to read this book because I am Korean and I don't usually get a chance to read a good book that takes place in Korea like this one. I think everybody should read this book plus it's sequel sometime. Steven Yum ASI"
4,So Far a Good Book,"This was a story of courage and strength. Yoko, and her sister Ko, are young, yet strong enough to survive through a long war, with nothing but the clothes on their back. They would not give up, and were victorious in their survival. This story shows great strength and bravery, and sense of family, where neither sister would let the other give up."
5,This is a wonderful true story of courage and bravery.,This book is great. It is not only inspriring but it is a true story. I think all peopel should read this story. It is beautifully written and I give it two thumbs up.
4,So Far From The Bamboo Grove,"A young Japanese girl, named Yoko, or little one - as her family calls her, is living in Korea with her family during World War II. They have to flee because the Korean government was after them because of who their father was. Yoko and her mother and sister went through many hardships during this war and found little peace."
4,PG-13 Book - Horror of war told through a young girl's eyes,"I chose this book for a mother/daughter book group I belong to. It comes highly recommended for middle school aged children. However, by chapter 6 I had encountered every horror from people's head's exploding to dying babies and repeated accounts of rape. I think the book is frankly too horrible for children younger than high school. (In fact I'm not sure it wasn't too horrible for me.) True there are lots of cultural, historical and other thought provoking ideas to be discussed and some good structural and plot analysis that can be done with the book, but I don't think the extreme brutality of the circumstances should be presented to children. The story is well told, but not beautifully written. Not for pleasure reading that's for sure!"
1,Very Lie,"The author say this is her own experience.But actually the story doesn't matched with the fact. wrong geographical fact, Wrong the phases of the times.it's a fiction.Remember the japanese massacre.They never apology. because they don't know the history. actually japanese people can't take education about there own history. (especially there own japanese history is terrible) when ever you can check it out if you have friend who from japan.It is not just there own problem. it is all of our country's.You can find one of the fact `unit 731` as WIKIPEDIA."
4,First album by a Brazilian pop institution,"This is the first album by the Brazilian ""axe"" pop band, Banda Eva. Originally released on the Columbia label in 1993. Songs include:1 Adeus, Bye Bye2 Tributo ao Apache (medley)3 Minha galera4 Tamanco malandrinho5 Voc no está6 Timbaleiro7 Iluará8 Torres de babel9 Cara do prazer10 Pot-pourri do Eva (medley)(DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Brazilian Music Guide)"
3,"Rod Stewart, Angel cd","The delivery & condition of this item were as good as ever, I just didn't like the music. There was only one song I liked, which is nobody's fault."
3,Not as described,"This could be a helpful book for native Spanish speakers who wish to improve their written English skills. It was not clear from the description that this was the type of book it was; the book was also described as a hardback, not the paperback ""workbook-like"" book that it was."
1,WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!,I like the other reviever bought this as a early present for my daughter who is learning to sew at church. i figure it would be cute for her to learn on . I Couldn't wait till she opened well christmas has came and gone and on it's way back and I still can't get this machine threaded.so i figured I was doing something wrong i took it to a seamtress who is teaching my daughter to sew. she got it threaded just to have the thread come a loose 3 times.I gave this 1 star cause they don't have a 0My point is this was a great idea but a waste of money don't even buy it. save your money and By a REAL sewing machine the kind your grandma had.
2,This machine cannot be used for much,"My daughter wanted to learn to sew so I bought this machine because I didn't want her using a powerful machine such as mine. This machine is made very well, but cannot accommodate fabric thicker than the lightest cotton. The fabric that comes with the machine is almost too thick. My daughter quickly became frustrated because she wanted to use other fabrics and we could not find anything thin enough for the machine. Felt and fleece are the best materials for beginners to practice with and I couldn't get these fabrics anywhere near the needle. We used this machine only a handful of times and then went to my big machine so my daughter could practice her stitches on felt. The best thing that this machine could be used for is practicing stitches on paper."
1,Waste.,"Bratz Make Your Own Sewing MachineThis sewing machine was bought for my daughter for Christmas. I was very disappointed in its proformance overall, the thread never stayed in the needle we were always having to rethread it. When sewing it never sew a straight line when guiding and holding the material. I would NEVER recommend this to another parent. I give this a thumbs down!"
5,Cat's meow at mealtimes,"I picked up the double-bowl and the larger single bowl at a grocery store YEARS ago - like 1996 - and I still have both pieces. They are great - simply elegant to go with your decor, heavy and thick walled for durability, and the right porportions for kitty use. They go in the dishwasher for cleaning and sanitizing and right back on the floor for breakfast/supper. One negative - if you use one of those abrasive pads, even the one for the glass, you'll scratch the glaze up. A good 10 minute soak in hot-hot water will loosen up any stuck-on food and you can wash them right up for the next meal. They're heavy enough that kitty can't drag them across the floor too."
2,My mother's fave,"God, when will the Baby Boomers just die? They run everything, they're rich, and they stop us Gen X and Gen Y kids from getting our propers. And now this video thing! Mom loves it, okay, which drives me up the wall!"
3,Long wait - Was it worth it,"For a start the book is 256 pages and not 320 and it does not weigh a ton more like 1.7 Kgs or 3.2 pound. It is normal weight and very definitely not excessive. Its a coffee table book. That being said it is a pictorial book with high quality photos on glossy expensive paper. The cut-aways and artwork are high quality, much like you would see in a part work periodical. It covers the 4 black jets, not to a great deal of depth owing to the number of pages that could be allocated to each. Yes its nice book, but I wonder, there are better books out there now, say by aerofax on each of the models written about that do not cost the excessive amount combined, that is now being asked due to this book being out of print."
3,better as a CD ?,"The authors have done a comprehensive job of finding books written in German about the United States, in the period 1800-1955. They must have spent considerable time rummaging in archives for the 19th century information.But this book came out in 2005. Maybe a reference book of this nature might be better received if it came out in CD form?"
4,Gaiman Rocks Marvel,"Bought this because im a big Gaiman fan,i thought the story,overall,was very good with a couple of surprises.Couldve used 1 of the characters a bit more and thats why it got a 4"
5,Marvel + Neil Gaiman,"The way I see it, Neil just had the awesome pleasure of reimaginating almost every major maverl character, and made the best job possible. If you like Neil books and scripts, you are going to love this, even if you know little or less about Marvel stuff."
4,Clever!,"I enjoyed seeing how each character was represented and how each character fit into this new ""old"" world. Plus it was fascinating seeing how they fit into the actual historical tale. Good stuff."
3,"Starts out good, but gets lost towards the end.","When I first heard David Waxman, he was here in Miami in club ""Crobar"" in south beach. I had recently started to get into ""house"" music, as I would only listen to different type of music, including only trance, electronica & techno.Well, this guy blew me away. After listening in the club for a while, I said I wanted the cd. A few days later I bought it online. I was quite impressed. The same music I heard at the club and I danced to much to was now at my fingertips in my cd player!!![.] This cd includes a lot of songs that will make you move your butt. One of those, my favorite are Muzikizum, Remainings, I am the Drum, Smoother....among others.A big dissapointment on this cd, is that after track 7 or 8, the cd starts to lose its intensity. The track selection after that is no longer the best and the music starts to slow down.I really like it up to song 7 or 8, after that I really don't like the rest."
1,We have it so good.,This book saddened me to the depths....I finally had to discard it. I love my country and am heavy-hearted to read such hatred toward people of faith.
3,"Nice, but can't get a true red","Good monitor for the price. No dead pixels and brightness is good. However, I can't get a true red. The red looks like a red orange."
3,generally a pleasure but hard on the eyes,"I'm writing this as a non-techy. For the first couple of days I fiddled with the brightness becuae I found the factory settings were too high. It hurt my eyes. I found the controls non-user friendly and only mananged to turn the brightness down through trial and error.nevertheless, I'm happy with the purchase. Colour is accurate and not overly sharp and I really like the size and weight of the monitor. I actually would have given it 3.5 if I could."
1,Horrid game,"This game is horrible. As a huge Star Wars fan, I was hoping for a fun, strategy game to play using the Star Wars universe.Yet, not even the force could bring this game back to the light side. The gameplay is aweful, graphics are worthless, and really there is no reason to play the game.If you want a good strategy game, try Starcraft, Age of Empires 2, or Civilization 3. AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS!"
1,Awful Game - Don't Waste Your Money,"Overly complex game. Start to finish there is nothing exciting included in this game. Whatever side you play starts with a great disadvantage and it just goes downhill from there. Not just a challenge, each order is monotonous and the game becomes disinteresting within an hour. Don't waste you time or money."
4,"Excellent Game, if you take the time to learn it","This is a very fun game. There are a million rules, but you catch on quickly. At first you'll be frusturated, but you come back again and again untill you beat it. EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE!"
2,another misused label,"I've had Rebellion for quite a while now and I'm still not quite too sure how the game works. It seems like a couple of the things that you could do that were advertised are completely nonexistant. Also, the game requires you to have some amazing micromanagement skills to play when you get near the end of the game. All those windows that pop up while you play won't make things any better. Perhaps the worst part of this game is the so called ""space combat"". The graphics, the controls and the concept of being only able to maneuver in a cube are grossly outdated even when the game came out. Yet for some twisted reason, once in a while, I'll get a feeling that I want to play the game, unfortunately this feeling will stop when I launch the program and all the bad memories come flooding back to me."
3,"Good game to play alone, but not against others.","This is a very fun game, but when you play on the net agaisnt others it seems to mess up a lot with REB EXE errors. so if you wanna play others it takes longer because you have to keep saving and restarting, if that problem was fixed all would be great in it."
3,Don't waste your money,"I was not impressed with it at all. I was expecting more I guess. Your only role is the commander. You get to give the orders, that's all. If that's what you like, go for it. Otherwise look for something else."
4,Very Nice Game,"This one is an oldy but goody, to be sure. It certainly doesn't possess the technology of today's games (one can still hold out hope of there maybe someday being an updated sequel...), but it is the only Star Wars game of it's kind. This strategy game emcompasses not just one army or one world, but the entire galaxy!You have to use worlds with high resources to boost your supplies, use diplomacy to gain the support of more planets, and build up armies of space ships to defend your planets and conquor your opponent. The ultimate game of conquest, don't expect to complete this game quick! The first time I played it all the way through it took me a couple months, playing for an hour or so each day! The game requires patience and dedication, but if that's your cup of tea, you will be well rewarded with Rebellion!"
2,Could have been better,"I expected a lot more from this game. It wasn't as fun to control everything as it could have been. The interface should have been easier to use.If the interface was easier to use, it would have been much better. I think Force Commander is more along the lines of what I want to get."
4,Rebelion's in the middle of the middle to top.,"the game could have been so much more, I agree. A exucution and interrogation process for prisoners, a ground combat engine, better travel times(almost 100 days from one end of the galaxy to another?), etc. But the 3-D space combat rocks! Much like the upcoming Force Commander. Also, a lot of characters and ships to command. multiplayer is fully supported, and you can chose your difficuty, galaxy size, and play both sides. The empires forces do seem not much larger than the rebels. Also, the idea of force rulling is made impossible by the rebellions on the planets. You get several permanent characters, plus some radomly selected ones too. You can also recruit and send people on missions, like rescues and assasination attempts. Overall, a good game. Try it."
3,Not as bad as you think,"I know this game has gotten bad reviews, but if you are a strategy (rather than action) game junky you'll still like this one. My favorite part is the detail you get about ship and unit capabilities. You can accelerate the game to get past the long waits and slow it when you need to make a move. Forget about the tactical interface, it sucks. Just simulate all your battles."
4,People who love Iggy,How many tribute cds for various artists exist? Quite a few. Iggy Pop fans may enjoy this one since it seems most of the recordings were made out of love and respect for this rock'n'roll icon. Many of the artists covering Iggy tunes on this cd are ones I have had the privilige of seeing play live and know they have a certain reverence concerning Iggy's music. This is what constitutes a good tribute for an artist. A few of Iggy's lesser known tunes are on this and thats cool. I prefer listening to Iggy doing IGGY but I have heard plenty of tribute albums to artists I admire and this is one of the better ones and perhaps the best to Iggy.
3,could do without it,"It was great to see this release, however, less than half of the songs are worth while. The dialog bits throughout the CD are more annoying than entertaining. This is more worthwhile to just download and pay for the individual songs you like rather than paying for the whole CD."
3,Few must-have songs,"There are some nice tunes here -- and the liner notes are truly excellent -- but for the most part, this CD really just highlights how many great Muppet tunes were actually on Sesame Street, and not the Muppet Show or Muppet movies. And the Sesame Street songs, probably for contractual reasons, are entirely absent from this disc.Still, it's nice to get the original Rainbow Connection (although a number of recent cover versions are better and really highlight how interesting the lyrics are), It's Not Easy Being Green and other classics."
3,Compilation CD's,"Bought the CD for Mahnah Mahnah, Rainbow Connection and Happiness Hotel. Wish more of the Muppet Christmas Carol music was on this CD. Usually I make it a rule to never buy a compliation CD, however where else was I going to find these 3 songs together? So I caved. The Monologue was funny once you realize the punch line is ""I'm-a wearing a neck-a-tie"" (knowledge of east coast dialects are helpful)"
4,lovely,A collection of the best Muppets songs.Kermit and miss Piggy in duet. What I don't like isFozzie interrupting the music. Just skip those tracks!
5,Get away from it all... WITH THE MUPPETS!,"I can come home from after a bad day at work, and pop this CD in while I'm cooking dinner. All of a sudden I'm whisked away to the muppet stage, or movie theater! Stesses magically are gone. You can't help but smile and hum along, even dance a bit, especially to favorites like, Mahna Mahna and Happy Feet.For all muppet fans, this CD is a MUST.I found it hard to find a CD with my favorite song of all time, but this CD has it-- THE RAINBOW CONNECTION.Muppet Fans rejoice, finally there is a collection that is just perfect."
2,Good but....,"The Muppets have always been and always will be fun for all ages. And even though I love some things on this CD (Mahna-Mahna, The Rainbow Connection, etc.), I have to admit that not having the original version of Gonzo's ""I'm Going to Go Back There Someday"" is a HUGE downer for fans. But the real slap in the face is that they included the absolutely horrendous version from Muppets in Space instead. UGH. It's surprising that Rhino would do that since they usually produce good stuff.Of course, I would've also like songs from ""Emmett Otter's Jug Band Christmas""...but that's just me."
5,Back to my childhood,"I'm 33, but one would never know it when I play this CD. It takes me back to a magical time, and I'm so excited that I still remember the words! This is an excellent gift for the Muppet in all of us."
4,Muppets CD,"I got my order item on time and it was in good shape. To no fault of the seller, I didn't really like the songs on the CD itself."
4,Mistake Purchase,"I thought this was a DVD. My 15mo old loves Elmo & Co. However, she pays no attention to this CD at all."
3,2/3 Pure Magic! 1/3 Brain-Numbing Pap!,"Good collection that spans the history of the Muppets, from the first shows through to the last movies. The first 2/3 of this CD (maybe 20-21 songs) are everything the Muppets mean to me: inspired zaniness! However ... the last part of the CD is devoted entirely to the insipid love ballads and ""togetherness"" songs that populated the later movies <sigh>. 3 stars out of 5, I'd love to give it more but YUCK those last few songs are bad. Why include ""I'm Going to go Back There Someday"" from ""Muppets in Space""??? The original version from ""The Muppet Movie"" with just vocal and banjo and simple backing music captures the wistful longing feel of the lyric, not the cheezy R&B synthesized backing tracks of the later version. <sigh>"
3,the muppets deserve the box set treatment !!,"now don't get me wrong, i love the muppets & this collection has a lot of good stuff on it. i just have a problem calling it the best.where is the swedish chef theme,the countless duets w/ big stars of the day,animal,the old guys in the balcony?what about the seseme street characters ? they were muppets.so were the fraggles & they all sang. there was also a lot of great dialogue in all of jim hensons stuff that muppet fans would love to have.give me 4 more 27 track cds & i'll be all over it.as for this offering it may be the best we can get our hands on right now.that is accept for gonzo remix at the end...totally sux a$$!!!!!!"
4,"Good for me, Kid couldn't care less.","I bought this thinking it would make my car rides better with my 17 month old. Truth be known, its made them better for me, but she still is a pain.I loved almost every track and the lyrics to most all of them came right back to me when the songs started. Its too bad that she won't enjoy them for a few more years."
4,"My Children Will Thank you, Rhino","My very first memory was being held by my father while listening to ""The Rainbow Connection"" from the Muppet Movie LP on a Fisher Price Lo-Fi Record Plyer. Since the Soundtrack has been out of print for years, and the death of Jim Henson signalled the end of the ""real"" muppets, I feared that my children would never be able to hear some of the best children's music of all time. Rhino not only gave us some of the best Muppet Show music with this collection, but nearly the entire collected soundtrack to the early Muppet Movies. Great move. I can't wait to rock my first child to sleep while playing Kermit's magnum opus in the nursery..."
5,Arrived quickly,"I love the Muppets. This is an excellent CD. It arrived very quickly, and in excellent shape. I have already added a few songs to my playlist."
5,Fun for all ages,"Great for people who still remember the show, and even our 3-year old is now addicted to this CD (never having seen the show). You tend to get those songs stuck in your head, so be prepared to be humming along for a while after the CD is over. There are two or three sappy songs on there - just skip those."
4,Many of the reviewers below,"Who so wholeheartedly accept Landes' reasons for the spread of Western thought would do well to read Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel to see a highly plausible alternative view (one that, in my view, makes far more sense than Landes' thesis.)That said I enjoyed the book and agree with many of the sentiments he expresses, but one can't read one book on the spread of European cultural values and decide that it tells the entire truth."
3,Where's the thesis?,"Landes seems to have used the approach often adopted by marketing professionals--keep 'em hanging on till the end. His thesis is most succinctly stated in the final chapter of the book. That means that the reader is left to try to figure out what all the myriad facts, figures and interesting anecdotes he throws out in the previous chapters are leading up to. It's a shame, because once you read the last chapter, you can almost see the logical framework that all these other details are supposed to support.While his tone is way too smug, and his general thesis fails to reach 'ultimate causes' as Jared Diamond's excellent book on a similar topic did so well, few readers will come away from this book without having learned something.It takes a long time to get through, probably because you have to keep asking yourself--""where is all this leading to?"""
2,Good to have on the shelf.,"I started this book with great relish, but found myself skimming faster and faster as the centuries progressed. It's chock-a-block with pertinent comments and interesting history, and the reader who follows Landes' innumerable footnotes will find no end of fascinating trivia, but what's lacking is a central thesis. We read what happened, but we don't gain any theoretical tools to learn why. Most disppointing for a book completed in 1997 is that the whole matter of globalization is summarily dismissed. The final chapter, begins with the premise that ""...we have become a world of nation-states...."" This is more true than not, but Landes is ignoring one of the most interesting trends of our day -- that the nation-states of the world are clearly losing their autonomous control over economic matters. I'm sure I'll refer to this book frequently for historical background, but as a read-through, it was far from satisfying."
1,A flawed analysis....,"It is a pity that in his analysis of the superiority of western culture, that he doesn't take into account the fact that the original industrial revolution was fuelled by the natural resources of Europe's colonies and the western expansion of the US. Basiscally western culture's prosperity was built on the back of free labour provided by the slave trade, the conquering of indigenous peoples (including the American indian) and generally the rape and pillage of economic resources of a large part of the world.Mr. Landes neglets the fact that the countries that industrialised during the industrial revolution all had the economic benefit of colonial resources. Those former colonies today trying to industrialise don't have this particular ""cultural"" advantage of having areas to conquer and exploit.Sorry this book is at best naive, at worst self serving."
2,Europe is great! Everyone else bow down before Europe.,"I'm not telling you not to read this book, for it can be enlightening, but take everything with a grain of salt understanding the very Eurocentric standpoint that Landes is taking."
1,this book really rates 0 stars,"This book is nothing more than regurgitated hogwash and a rerun of Darwinism, etc. recast as values and other factors such as temperature. Why such a book would be so popular in a country where the lack of values has been repeatedly shown is a mystery to me."
1,bigotry embedded in economics/history,"I am struck by how a ""respected"" author can resort to flagrant bigotry of other cultures, specifically Arab-Muslim culture, e.g. reference to boys having ""golden penises"". It is crass, uncouth, and resorts to anti-Arab stereotypes. Would such crass stereotypes be made of other ethnicities, the book and author would have been excoriated- not so here.It is really part and parcel of the systematic denigration of Arab-Muslim culture that one finds in such bigots as David Pryce-Jones, Mark Steyn, Daniel Pipes and Victor David Hanson and other neocons who are putative experts in Arab culture."
1,Hmm.,"Okay, I have to admit I haven't finished reading this book yet.BUT I have one small thing I must point out. When Landes discusses the quincentary of Columbus' landing (in 1992), he implies that ""celebrations"" of the European discovery of the New World were totally quashed due to being seen as politically incorrect.One of the specific examples he cites was the ""1492"" exhibit at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, which he describes as ""ABC--Anything But Columbus."" Uh--I WENT to that exhibition, and it was ONE-THIRD European art (in addition to 1/3rd Asian and 1/3rd Pre-Columbian). Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!I know it's a small point, but I think it illustrates that a) the author has a tendency to rely on his faulty memory instead of the actual facts and b) he does so because he is eager to push his own views.I'm being nice by suggesting it's faulty memory rather than outright lying."
2,Serpent eats its tail.,"If, as Landes says, tolerance was what made the West great, then his book shows we are reaching the end.Yes, the West may have possessed -- and seized -- some of the assets that led to its triumph. But there's an even more important question than why the West dominates today's global economy: Is that economy (which is wasteful in resources, natural and human) sustainable? If not, we may have more to learn from other cultures than Landes recognizes.Contrary to Landes, multiculturalism is not totalitarian ""political correctness"" (red-baiting pun on Parti Communiste); it's an urgent attempt to learn, for those with keen eyes and ears not just loud voices."
2,"book is a personal commentary, but not good history","This book is a commentary, and however amusing it may be to some, it is not ""good history"".Landes brutally manipulates his citations throughout to support his views, which are so eurocentric and narrow minded that they are frequently insulting to anyone of intelligence. Scholors aware of relevent facts so obviously ignored will be frustrated, and those without this level of knowledge will be frightfully misinformed.Don't let the number of citations fool you; this is not reliable information despite the author's Harvard credentials. In an effort to sell another book, he bulldozes over the truth and fertilizes his garden of bunk to feed his sensationalized thesis."
2,VERY FUNNY !,"Mr. Landes started this job already with a definited purpose: to make poor people accept the fact that they are poorer because they are dummier. Since the beginning of the book, Landes tries to demonstrate his ""theories"" about the white civilization superiority above the rest. In other words, North is better than SOuth. The book is full of prejudice, hidden meanings, pro-liberalism. One step more and we could have listened the American anthem playing on it."
3,"Useful explaining the past, hopeless for the future","Whilst Landes may strive to convince us of what the keys to economic wealth and growth are; we must remember that he is a historian and The Wealth and Poverty of Nations is history. Culture, economic geography, social conditions, and other impediments to economics are increasingly irrelevant in a new millienium of hypercompetition, globalisation and cyberspace-driven economics.Read Landes about the past but he is no tour guide for the future. The rules that govern the past do not govern the future. It is a new ball game from here on."
3,Intriguing but flawed,"This book is fascinating in places, but repetitive and trite in others.Frankly while more quantitative and traditional in its approach, it pales in comparison to the sweeping and much more engaging treatment of essentially the same subject in Jared Diamond's brilliant Guns, Germs and Steel."
1,The book does not answer the question posed in the title,"Rather than discussing the ""why?"" most of the emphasis of this book is on the ""how"". Overall it is fairly entairtaining but lacks cohessivness. The authors seems to be very selective in the statistics he uses. It is very dishartening that a presumed scholarly work fails to follow the simplest rules of scientific investigation. If the answer to the question still intrigues you, I sugest that you buy a different book. Guns, germs and steel by Jared Diamond is far superior and rigourous in its approach."
2,Shallowness masquerading as intellectual depth,"This book provides an OK overview of the divergent economic histories of Europe, Asia, the Americas, and Africa. The author basically argues that Europe (and now the US) has triumphed in economic competition primarily because of superior culture, economic policies, and institutions. As a pretty conservative believer in the need for free markets and other spurs to innovation and effort, I can support that. However, the author constantly overgeneralizes and presents his own ill-informed prejudices as substantiated analysis. The real kicker is this: he claims the recent success of Taiwanese and Korean firms in high-tech manufacturing is due to manual dexterity gained from years of eating with chopsticks.For a much more worthwhile (if intellectually challenging) book on this subject, read Michael Porter's ""Competitive Advantage of Nations."" After reading that book, you will feel like you really learned something profound."
1,tripe,"Chief problems with Mr. Landes' oeuvre are not its' amazing dishonesty, lack of basic erudition or blatant racism (although he's got a good deal of racism that amply compensates for other deficiencies, such as the lack of sound historic knowledge). Main problem with this book is the terrible fact that it actually became (very) successful. It sells well. That is a real pity, because the Wealth and Poverty is an imposter-sort of book. It pretends to be what it is clearly not. Like being a good history book.The Wealth and Poverty of Nations is an ideological propaganda piece. Like other works of this genre, it carries main ideological concept (dogma, belief, albeit an irrational one) and ""supporting material"". Because it is virtually impossible to prove this kind of ideological belief from scientific standpoint, beliefs are beliefs, and facts and figures are lacking, then other methods are applied. [...]"
1,Because Europeans are Superior,Old wine in new bottle.It is not in the genes - it is in the memes.Boring............
1,Eurocentric hogwash!,"This is the least radical history book written in the last half century. It is rife with archaic ideas. Mr. Landes is no kind of intellectual. If you want this kind of nonsense, read a history textbook from the 50's."
1,Simply Idiotic,"Though I enjoyed Landes' humour sometimes, this book is by no means an honest endeavour to answer the question posed by the title. The work is mostly rhetoric. Though I agree with some of his conclusions but his arguments are almost always fellacious. This is my first history reading and I have almost no background on the subject. Still after few chapters it became clear that the book does not meet the criteria of an academic writing. It is a shame for Harvard that Landes carries its credentials!"
1,Worst book ever,We're reading this in my Business in World History class. The book makes me want to stab my eyes out and jump off of a sky scraper. Yay! :)
1,complain,i didn't get teh book yet!!!! how can i follow up on my reservation???? this is the last time i'm ordering a book thorugh amazon.
4,An interesting new perspective on history,"Landes provides a very interesting look at the history of nations and how their economies developed. The book goes back hundreds of years in explaining current matters that we almost forget to question. (Why is India so poor? and Europe so rich?) The answers are not simple so the book occasionally gets too complicated. In the end though the book is entertaining, enlightening and even an investment of your time. Also, too be read - Guns, Germs and Steel. A great prologue to this which will bring yet another layer to the debate."
1,Full of prejudice.,"I found this book full of prejudice, full of value judgements,and only slightly scientific. I would only like to put out this question,was Spain responsible of the poverty of all South Europe, Center- and South-America ? Fortunely there are much more historians who go beyond this limited book."
4,an alternate title: Culture and Progress,"If you are interested in the question of how it was that western Europe and then the United States led the world in developing science and technology, and are now consequently leading the world in economic development, then this book is for you. For example, what were the social and cultural conditions that allowed the Industrial Revolution to happen first in Britain? What was different in China, or in France? Geography plays a role, but so do many other factors. By comparing and contrasting western Europe and the United States with other cultures, David Landes suggests some answers.I loved this book!My only complaint is that the author does not always write in complete sentences. Some missing verbs. Others are missing other parts of speech, such as nouns, conjunctions. However, other readers have found this style refreshing, so it must be a matter of taste."
3,France in India,"Dear Mr Landes, I saw you on french TV and bought your book. In the chapter about India, You never mentionned DUPLEIX. This guy nearly got all india for France (the king of france at that time) and was defeated by the british . the french kept in hand only five(5) ports of commerce: Yanaon, Pondichery, Karikal, Mahé, etc.. I didnt' read anything about this part of histry in your book . is it on purpose? alain Malliet"
2,disappointing,I found the title of this book quite misleading as the narrative fails to answer that very question. There is no clear thesis and argumentation and the book is rather a long series of individual stories in praise of the achievements of Western culture or heartbreaking accounts of the misery elsewhere (the Japanese wife!).My two stars are for the fact that I still found some of the stories well researched and interesting seen by themselves.
3,interesting but mis-leading,"This book is interesting but very disappointing/misleading at the same time, and even annoying sometimes. In some way, the author was too ambitions and eventually did not deliver.What is interesting:the question that the book tried to answer is fascinating,the stories of rise and fall of various empires are also interestingWhat is disappointing:the book is really incoherent, the analysis are shallow and not convincing,many facts are questionable, which clouds the main theme of the bookWhat is annoying:I don't mind reading a book which is not politically correct, but the author went too farin suggesting that the American Indians deserved their fate because of their human sacrifice, thatthe rise of Taiwan and Korea was due to the fact that they were once colonized by the Japaneses,"
4,CULTURE COUNTS!,"The author gives an in depth incisive analysis that shows in great detail how culture truly affects a societies prosperity. The western countries largely had firm beliefs in progress, private property, freedom, a work ethic, tenacity, thrift, and competition. These traits led to Europe's unprecedented innovations and technological advancements. Japan and Hong Kong are prime examples of non-European countries that have had fantastic success by adopting western style Capitalism. In my opinion their strong sense of family was just as crucial. His conclusion that until these traits are adopted by all nations, the CHASM between the rich and poor nations will continue to grow. His thesis proved logical enough for this skeptical reader to agree with him."
4,Good work about this subject.,"I'm an (unemployed) agronomist and brazilian.I read this book translated to the portuguese, here in Brazil.The idea of this book is that geography, political and cultural diferences gave poverty or wealth to the nations.This book is good about this subject.The failures of this book really exists.To exemple, it claims that catholicism is bad to development.Well, among the 30 best nations to live in the world, 1 is jew(Israel).Two(Japan and Cingapore)are budists and more then 20 of the rest of then, are catholic nations.The lack of coal(not catholicism) was bad to Italy, Portugal and Spain in the past.When oil age came, this problem was over, and development came to Italy, Portugal and Spain.This reality isn't showed in this book."
3,Interesting thesis; odd writing style.,"I found this book to be a bit overhyped. The underlying contention that human habits (when made socially commonplace through institutions) have a significant impact on economic growth is interesting, but the style is quite odd for a Harvard professor. Many sentences are fragments. Like this. Perhaps he thinks that enlivens the prose but I think it is annoying. The book is also much longer than it need be. Further, the approach is exclusively historical, with attention being paid to current economic analysis only to discredit it. For the first 10 or 12 chapters I felt like I was reading a book on world history, with the reader being left to draw his or her own conclusions about why some nations came out winners and others losers. In the end though it's a solid tome on the shelf, with a fresh view on the matter."
4,An Insightful Approach,"Mr. Landes wrote an excellent book approaching the question of why some nations succeed while others fail. It takes a look at one of the single most important yet overlooked traits of a society, personal freedom. From the acceptance of multiple religons in England to the diverse makeup of America, the trait of progress that matters the most is the overlooking of religon and the freedom to pass information.Traditional Marxist's will find this book detestable. It shows in many ways why Marx was flawed. It also shows the religous zealots that moderation is important.His approach is interesting because he puts examples in that are well documented. The view is just adjusted to get a better perspective of the data. For the nay sayers who deride the book for its lack of social grouping and naming of social elites, it does not follow the normal Marxist mantra's. Personal freedom is the keystone of his hypothesis.I will say however, it is a bit dry."
1,Disapointing,"This book compares very poorly with the entertaining and well thought out Guns,Germs and Steel. Landes book is a anectodotal ramble. It contains little in the form of a central thesis or argument."
5,Great Overview of How Societies Developed Differently,"This book was my favorite book in university. It goes over how the different societies of Eurasia developed differently, and how they ended up in vastly different places. Who knows if it's right or not, but it is VERY well written and the argument is logical. I recommend this book for anybody who likes modern world history."
2,Outdated graphics...Outdated sound...Just Outdated!!,"I'd like to consider myself a Star Wars fan, so I was looking forward to getting this game. Even though, I was expecting ""okay"" graphics, I thought ""it can't be that bad"". But after watching the opening sequence, I have concluded that this is by far one of the worst Star Wars games, in regards to graphics, that I have ever seen. It was enough to turn me off completely and curse the day that I had bought the game. Even the music, one of the things that makes Star Wars ""STAR WARS"", is horrible. Forget the orchestra! You'd be lucky enough to get a synthesizer!! *Please note: this review is based on graphics and sound alone. I am still in the disappointment phase so I haven't really gotten into the storyline of the game. If you are a die hard Star Wars fan and can tolerate crappy graphics/sound, buy this game... at your own risk! If not, don't waste your time or money. In either case, you'd have more fun playing with the actual toys."
5,A Classic,"TIE Fighter by Lucas Arts is simply a classic. It, and Lucas Arts' earlier title X-Wing, have set the standard and paved the road to newer titles such as X-wing vs. TIE Fighter and X-Wing: Alliance. This game's graphics are dated, however the gameplay and storyline factor of the game easily make up for this drawback. Users with faster computers may be interested in the X-wing Collector's Series (also from Lucas Arts) instead, which features the games X-wing AND TIE Fighter with updated graphics. The original gameplay has not been changed in this newer edition."
4,TIE Fighter/X-Wing,This is a truely great game and the last lucasarts game made that can run off a normal Macintosh! This games graphics may be outdated but obviously outdue the prehistoric graphics of the original X-Wing. This game also follows a very good storyline paralleling the events occuring after the battle of Hoth up until right before the battle of Endor. This is definately a game worth buying for all the Star Wars fans out there that just like the classics.
2,Far from being Ultimate at all,"It's no secret I'm not much of a fan of Marvel's Ultimate line (besides Mark Millar's Ultimates that is), and this collection (which collects the 4 issue mini-series of the same name) helps me prove my point. Taking place in Marvel's Ultimate universe before Matt Murdock became the horned vigilante and Elektra became a cold hearted assassin, this mini-series is an origin story/love story turned tragic; but the story doesn't go anywhere special, and while writer Greg Rucka is a solid writer in his own right, his story just can't compare with Frank Miller's epic, classic saga of years back. The art by X-Treme X-Men artist Salvador Larrocca is his typical style while he makes Elektra look simply gorgeous. This book also contains issue #9 of the regular Daredevil title by David Mack and Joe Quesada which is the beginning of the ""Parts of a Hole"" story. I suggest picking up that book instead of this one, and leave this in the dust."
3,Curse Of Monkey Island,"The Monkey Island series (The Secret Of Monkey Island, The Secret Of Monkey Island II: LeChuck's Revenge, Curse Of Monkey Island) has been a favorite of mine for a long time. The first two in the series were excellent, with humor, wit, and filled with puzzles that will drive you to play for hours. However, CMI did not compare to the greatness of the first two games. I was very dissapointed, especially at the rewardless, short, unexplained ending. LucasArts stil did a pretty good job with animation, sound, and a solid challenge."
5,"Monkey Island, and Better Than Ever!","Man, I love Lucas Arts! It's one of the few dependable companies you can count on to pop out a few great, funny games a year (and a few Star Wars games, to boot)! Its products are all every bit as good as its originals! I went into this game wondering how Lucas Arts could possibly live up to the expectations of the Monkey Island series, and, I've learned how! The animation, the jokes within jokes, the story... I don't see how anyone could give this game less than a mediocre review! If you want a game that will entertain you for hours, then this is the one!"
2,Short,"I thaught this game was an exelent third part to the triliogy, unfortunately it was to short to hold my attention. Certain neccecary items are almost inpossable to find, but if you backtrack they come around. The quirkeyness and graphics are its greatest atributes. I would recomend this only to those who are die hard fans, and if you have seen Lucas's films. You may be disapointed."
2,A pathetic conclusion to a once-great series.,"The first two games in the Monkey Island series were fresh, funny, and inventive. The Curse of Monkey Island is none of these things. Rather, it feels like a harsh and manufactured attempt to recreate what made the first two games so great. It does not succeed. Without Ron Gilbert, and without the slightest idea of what the first two games were about, The Curse of Monkey Island, had it been called something else (as it should have) might have been okay. But its poor graphics, mostly unfunny humor, and theme completely foreign to the series make it a game no fun of the series should bother to play. If you've never heard of Monkey Island before, it may be worth it, but it's not likely."
2,A pallid imitation of what once made the series great.,"Just about everything that made the first two games in the Monkey Island series great is missing in The Curse of Monkey Island. The Curse of Monkey Island isn't downright awful or completely without worth--it is a thoroughly polished and professional game. It simply has nothing to do with the games that came before beyond the names of the main characters. The characters seem like different people, the nature of the puzzles is different, the artistic style doesn't seem to work for the game, and the game seems overall quite dreary and less lively than the others in the series. It even does its best to ignore the ending of LeChuck's Revenge (the second game in the series), which anyone who played that game should know shouldn't be possible. The Curse of Monkey Island is best played by those who either didn't play or have no memory of the first two superior games in the series. This one simply cannot compare."
3,Mixed feelings,"If you like this one, try to buy others in The Bolshoi at The Bolshoi series, like Romeo and Juliet with Mukhamedov and Bessmertnova. (Unfortunately, few seem to be available.)Ivan is overwhelming, bigger than life. (His rages are terrifying indeed.) Mukhamedov is at his best when dancing with Bessmertnova.The story is confusing in places. Perhaps, I need to refresh my memory of that period of Russian history. Chiefly I felt that it was too short for what the ballet was trying to convey.The sets are simple, which is good for this particular ballet. Elaborate sets would only distract. The drama is very intense, carried admirably by the dancers."
5,Ballet,A Bolshoi treat for the eyes and ears. The dancing is superb and the music of Prokofiev dramatic and engaging. One of my favorite ballet DVDs.
4,Hugh Sinclair Gets His Chance,"THE SAINT TAKES OVER is a 1940 movie about Simon Templar's adventures which begin on board an ocean liner bound from London to New York. The villains in this case are gangsters who fix horse races. The role of the Saint (Simon Templar) is played by George Sanders for the fifth time in this series. The cast also includes Wendy Barrie, Jonathan Hale and Paul Guifoyle.In THE SAINT'S VACATION Simon Templar tries to take a holiday in Switzerland but ends up instead immersed in a case involving espionage and a secret code. Hugh Sinclair gets his first chance in the role of the Saint. Also included in the cast are Sally Gray, Arthur MacRae and Cecil Parker."
5,INSIGHTFUL AND WELL WRITTEN BOOK,An insightful and well written book-gives a new view of the man - Malcolm X
4,WONDERFUL READING MATERIAL,I JUST STARTED READING THE BOOK LAST WEEK AND CAN NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN. I AM A HISTORY MAJOR AND READING THIS BOOK WITH ALL THIS INFORMATION ABOUT MALCOLM AND HIS OWN FAMILY HISTORY IS WONDERFUL.MR. COLLINS DID A WONDERFUL JOB!...
4,great collection item,"a memoir on Malcolm x long over due, a tribute to the man and the Little family. a must read book."
2,"Some recycled segments, only one memorable scene","This was quite a forgettable Playboy DVD, especially if you have other Playboy DVDs in your collection.I was disappointed because 3 of the 9 segments were recycled from other DVD titles. The Rock Climb segment is a condensed version that originally came from the Hard Bodies DVD. The Naughty Neighbors segment was the same as the Karen McDougal-Daphnee Duplaix segment in the Girls Next Door: Naughty & Nice DVD. Even the Virtual Girl segment with Shauna Sand came from the same DVD.Of the remaining segments, only one segment called Touch TV was really good, with some nice girl-girl action.For those interested in this title, rent it first before considering to buy it. If this is your first Playboy DVD purchase, then all of the segments will appear as new to you, and it might not be a bad purchase for you."
3,Does what is says,"Works fine as advertised, but I actually don't really use it much. Probably better things out there in same price range, but it's an OK performer."
5,Works and manages cables.,"I really like this product- it cleaned up my picture on my 55"" LCD a little- was good to begin with but better now. It also helps me manage my cables. You cannot tell from the back of my entertainment system that there are 7 devices connected. Nice to know how many amps my system is pulling too. Hope I never have to put it to the ultimate test- would hate to lose it."
5,monster clean power,Great item to protect your very expensive electronics. Has plenty of plugs and looks great too.
1,Burned up right away - smoke and all - it's dead,"I was tempted by the GBD price and the positive reviews, but this item proved worthless for me:One day I plugged in a new Onkyo receiver and a new Onkyo ipod dock and played some music for about one hour. Then I unplugged everything to install a stereo cabinet and put the components in the cabinet. Once assembled, I plugged the HTS 3600 back to the same wall outlet. No lights came on. A couple of minutes later I smelled and saw smoke. It had burned itself up. It hadn't even been turned ""on"" or had any components plugged to it yet. I won't buy Monster again to manage power, it can't even handle being plugged in!Also noted: the Monster looks good but feels cheap. Plugs from components fit very loose in the the HTS 3600 outlets and I also noticed that the outlets themselves are flexible in the HTS 360 - like they are only screwed in from above but not below so the whole plate that holds the outlets bends upward a bit as you plug in a component."
3,Audible buzz,"As some reviewers mentioned unit may produce audible buzz. May be OK in AV rack, but totally unacceptable in audiophile conditions. Interestingly enough, my unit was placed close to a desktop computer and buzz changed when I operated mouse wheel. Go figure. Perhaps unit is not shielded enough? Another similar unit I owned died after 4 years during power outage when I guess there were several power spikes and power turned on and off a few times. Monster didn't protect my Parasound Halo processor which then needed $300 worth of repairs."
1,Does not support UPS to power it,If you buy this don't expect to power it with a UPS. I hooked mine up with a APC 1500 UPS with an attached additional battery pack for extended life. When i had the first power outage all went fine until the power came back on and it the UPS switched to utility power from battery back up and the Monster went through a full reset causing all of the connected devices to have to be reprogrammed. Monster said that they did not support their device on a UPS. So I have a Monster HTS 3600 for a door stop. Absolutely worthless to me
3,Over-priced surge protector,"Don't believe the hype on these units improving sound and video. I noticed no difference. This is nothing more than a rack mounted surge protector. For the price, I thought I could use it as a line conditioner when running a generator. Support said this is in no way a line conditioner. I guess you pay the high price for the good looks. I actually purchased the 3500 which has a voltage meter instead of a digital readout. Luckily, with the $50 rebate (which I have not received yet), I paid $137. If you can get it for cheap, then this unit is fine."
5,Great Product,"I've owned this product for just a couple of weeks now, but so far am very satisfied. I have always found Monster products to be well built, and this one is no exception. Sure, it looks good in the rack. But more importantly, it helps me sleep better at night knowing my system is protected. The price is right, too. Highly recommended!"
4,Just what I wanted!,This Monster Power center had all the features I was looking for. It does not disappoint. No problems with the device or the service. Got it for a steal on Amazon.
5,VERSITILE AND BUILT WITH ATTENTION TO DETAIL,"I am very happy with unit. I like the status l.e.d. lights on the rear of unit by each outlet as well as orange power status light on main power plug. Power plug is flat for maximum clearance behind furniture. The power cable is very long and flexable and can be routed easily in tight spaces. I purchased this unit mainly for the 12 volt trigger for my powered subwoofer.New receiver manufactures are not putting switched AC outlets on the rear of their units anymore in order to save money. When I purchased my new receiver, I had to look for another Sub trigger solution and this unit was a good option and connects to my new receiver with the included long 1/4 inch 12 volt trigger cable!The front dimmable digital display shows AC voltage or amp usage to monitor power draw. This unit also come with one gold terminal 75 ohm cable and a sheet of labels so you can ID all of your component plugs.I highly recommend this unit."
1,Poor Job,I bought two Monster HTS 3600's to protect my stereo. One of them blew up 30 days after the warranty ran out for no apparent reason. I wish I had understood the warranty was only a year. The length of the warranty is not on the Amazon site. Clearly I should have done more research. Buyer beware --- and wary.
3,Monster HTS 3600 MKII 10-Outlet Power Center with Stage 3 Clean Power,"This system seems to work OK to protect my equipment. I bought it from BuyNow Incorporated thru Amazon and because 30 days had passed they said they I couldn't return it (part of the LED readout burnt out, cannot read voltage or amp draw). I didn't want to return it, just have the LED readout repaired. They suggested that I contact the manufacture and maybe they'll repair it. Apparently they are not a dealer so they could care less since ""their 30 day return policy had expired"". Not to happy about this situation. Rated it 3 stars because of the readout not working but I do believe that it'll protect my syste."
5,Cherished!!!,"This is a must for anyone wishing to study the silhouette animation form. In that there are very few examples to readily draw from in the modern day marketplace. Not too mentioned the acclaimed director behind the force of this production.This might be very good for American children as well, or at least it should be. There is not too much color for the hyper minds of their societal youth, yet it does provide historical takes on every kids embellishment or fascination with royalty and monarchy. In the sense that there are different takes and adventures on princes and princesses from varying cultural perspectives. It is humor filled for all ages to appreciate.The craft and design work is none to miss. This simplicity and perfection in composition and staging is a great start for anyone aiming to study the process of animation or this particular type of form."
4,Fascinating fantasy,"This animation represents thoroughly modern imagery and imagination. It also pays homage to the oldest extant feature-length animation,The Adventures of Prince Achmed. The silhouetted characters in this draw directly from that older movie, even if the characters and magic gadget are quite contemporary.A half-dozen vignettes form this feature, with a little story-telling glue between them. In that outer story, a boy and girl share a fantasy. Then, with the help of the gadget, they enter into it. One of those stories has the flavor of a Japanese folktale, another shows the magic kiss gone terribly (and repeatedly) wrong, another shows a science fiction variation on the quest for the princess's hand, and so on. They're all easy to enjoy, but that tribute to animation history adds a pleasant overtone as well.-- wiredweird"
1,"I Don't Know What Prompted Those Other 5-Star Reviews, This One is Crap!","the music is very good, but this product from Collector's Choice is junk! the sound is NOT good, it is barely passable, and the insert liner notes talk about how ""boogie shoes"" became the 5th single to chart from this album...that song is on an earlier K.C. album, and Saturday Night Fever, it is not, and never was on Part 3...oh, and the insert lists the band name as ""K.C. and the Sunshine Bank""! avoid this garbage"
4,A pretty good meter for auto and motorcyle testing,"Unfortunately analog meters are getting hard to find but this is a good one. For testing charging systems on motorcycles, analog meters are by far the best. This one has all the right scales and does a good job. The only thing I don't like about it is the beeper on the Rx1 scale. I took the risk of ruining my meter and cut one of the leads to the beeper and luckily there were no ill effects. I'm in the motorcycle business and I recommend this meter to all my customers."
1,sorry,I can not give a very accurate review on this multimeter for the simple reasonthat I can not get it to work.
4,Ok quality,"Very hard to find this movie. Very grateful for the DVD. The quality is ok, it's watchable, it's just a bit grainy and looks like it came off of some old VHS, but if you can get past that then you'll still enjoy the movie with no problems."
4,Once In A Blue Moon,"The first time I watched this movie was about 13 years ago with my children, now Im watching it with my grandchildren. Wonderful movie, very imaginative. The kids love it. Timeless"
1,Rubbish,"I bought this CD thinking it was by Metro, a great jazz group, instead it was a terrible noise from Brasil. I love Musica Brasileiro but this is rubbish. Big mistake.If you think this album is by Metro ( Jazz ) don't buy this CD."
5,"Amazing Stories, including The Family Dog",Product was shipped quickly and professionally packed. Well done! I would order from this site again and would suggest to my friends.
3,"It does the job, but..","I have a hammer toe (as pictured in the photo of the item) which is uncomfortable and annoying. It does help with the problem, but not to the extent that I hoped. My main complaint is that if it is worn every day, it starts to fail in a couple of weeks. It is certainly worth a try, but I am looking for something sturdier so I don't have to keep replacing them."
2,The toe straighten not the best,"I thought the toe straightener was a little firmer. Because it is flexible I really don't see it doing what I anticipated which was more of a firmer grip on the toe to straighten it. However, I will keep using the product."
2,No good,"I bought these hoping to fix my hammer toes. Unfortunately they are not stiff enough to hold the toe straight. I found athletic tape, cardboard, and wrapping each problem toe individually to be more effective."
3,TOE STRAIGHTENER OUTER,"OK. I guess it works, but my dang toe hurt after wearing it awhile. Probably need toe surgery."
1,HORRIBLE!,"A friend gave me this tape for Christmas. My favorite movie is ""Spartacus"" and he thought I would appreciate it. Well, it was IMPOSSIBLE to see anything for the most part -- in some scenes the lighting is almost non-existent and there are occasional skips in the music track. The corny close-ups of overacting dancers don't belong in this because they are so laughable. Amazing that people actually liked this tape. (I have a feeling they got the two Spartacus tapes confused -- there is a later version of this ballet and that one might be better.)"
5,Great Product,"Product works great, I can change the angle of the TV depending on seating location and light into the room."
2,Boring,I dislike this CD. The music is childish and boring. It reminds me of a ballerina jewellery music box. I find it impossible to listen to it a second time. From now on I will pay attention only to reviews by Amazon Verified Purchasers.
4,Fram PH3387A Extra Guard,"its a spin on oil filther. no frills - no thrills, just remove and replace. Fram is a product that I trust and have been using for some 30+ years and I've never had a problem with their oil filthers. also the price is alot cheaper trhen anyone in town."
4,"Hey, It's an Oil Filter","You screw it on, oil goes through it for a few months, then you take it off and screw on another one.....What can I say?"
2,Wasn't working for me,"The heroine has visions. With this story, I was a bit semi-bored. I guess I wanted a passionate hot romance and to me, this wasn't it."
1,"stupid, self-serving, transparent plot. unbelievable.","Where do I start? Two of us are writing this review together. One of us actually managed to finish the whole book- because she was stuck on an airplane. The other only made it to the first sex scene before bailing out. (Van made use of the barf bags on the plane.) As two working scientists, we couldn't stomach the idea that at the end, a handful of grass wins out over a gun. No matter how bad the allergy - you can't shoot a gun at her? Give me a break! And this is the guy who we're supposed to believe is capable of conquering the human race? He doesn't show any guts. I can't believe people are giving it 4 stars. Sure, it's great to make science accessible to the layman. But why does the principal investigator have to be so horny? Why is she so intent on garnering new lovers? Can't a modern, strong, assertive, intelligent woman be complete without the need for men's sexual attentions?"
1,YAWN,"Good Lord, what a bore. And I love scientific mysteries. An editor should tell author how to get off to a fast start."
5,Good Adaptation of a Superb Novel,"The National TreeDavid Kranes' outstanding novel, The National Tree, finds a solid adaptation in this Hallmark production. The essence of the book, a deep and evocative exploration of a father and son relationship, is beautifully captured in the film. The premise, a cross country trip to deliver the National Tree to the President's lawn is well rendered; Andrew McCarthy and Andrew Williams do a superb job. But in an hour and a half, the quirkiness and delight of the novel could not be completely explored. Kranes' characteristic gentle and offbeat humor comes through so much more completely in the book which has become a family Christmas Classic for so many people."
4,The National Tree,This was a great movie to watch with young teens. My grandchildren really enjoyed it. I love anything that Andrew McCarthy is in. Would love to see Straight from the heart but can't see paying $88.00 dollors for it. Why is it so expensive? I would recomend The National Tree for all.
2,Disappointment,"I always look forward to the Christmas season because of the great movies, especially Hallmark movies. This movie was a waste of time and money. It was silly, a rehash of every father-son bonding movie ever made. The actors seemed to be as bored as I was. What a disappointment!"
4,the national tree,bought it because it was a christmas movie and and we watch christmas movies year round. we'll watch this again but not as often as some others we own.
1,this movie was horrible,you took a good movie that was made a long time a go and you totally screwed it all up.. Good job (sarcasim) anyways later youscrew ups. The only good thing in the movie was leo
2,Bad for new improvisers,"I was not impressed with this book. I think there is a lot of advice here that is bad for new improvisers. It may be useful for more experienced improvisers to give them ideas of something else to do and think about while on stage. I've never seen the author perform, but his transcripts of ""good"" improv scenes sound like boring ones. It's a lot of people standing around asking questions to each other until they figure out what the scene is about. I prefer to ""get to it"" more quickly. I found the tone of the writing very patronizing."
5,Better Improvising Lessons,"This book could be your first on improv, but it is better as a follow-up to such classics as Truth in Comedy. The lessons that Mick Napier teaches are more advanced and serve as a complement (if not a replacement) to the fundamentals that you must learn first. He has some unorthodox methods that will surprise people who religiously follow ""the rules of improv."" But you may find that this book helps your scenes to flow more naturally.This is a great way to test some new ways of thinking about improv, while it may trigger you to discover some of your own techniques. Buy it if you have been in the game for a while and are looking for a change of pace."
3,A Rollercoaster Ride,"Upon completing the article in Filmfax magazine entitled: Dick York: A Farewell Interview, I could not wait for the entire manuscript of his autobiography to be published. Although I consider York to be among my favorite actors, the man was truly wired and somewhat of a self destruction personality. I grew angry when I read that he did not handle his back problem the way he should have. And upon learning he was suffering from Emphysema, he continued to smoke.The book was indeed a rollercoaster ride. One must read the book 2 or 3 times to keep up with York's ramblings. It was an interesting read that also gave me a headache at times."
3,Too different for my liking,"I've known that Dick York had been planning to publish his memoirs before he passed on and never thought that they would ever be published. So I was quite thrilled and excited to read this book that he had written.All though it does give a great glimpse into his mind and soul, it was rather scary to me. He seemed to suffer from Multiple Personality Disorder because many of these personalities would narrate the book.True, it did show how much he loved his wife, and I am glad it was published and it will be a great inclusion to my Bewitched library, but I would say be aware that it is not your typical auto-biography."
2,Uh????,"Talk about needing a good editor. Whoa! You need a tanquilizer to follow this guy's story. I love Bewitched and I liked York's portrayal of Darrin very much, far more than Sargent's, but the man was out there in real life. It is very hard to follow this book, see or understand his growth and development. It is very hard to understand what the story is in this book. And as a father of four, I have to say that while York's trying to help others is commendable, charity begins at home and he should have been more concerned with providing for his family, rather than letting tenants skip on their rent month after month until the family lost everything. It is just difficult to make something out of this book. But if this was his real self, he was a brilliant actor because his portrayal of Darrin is wonderful."
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this CD for a special church project involving kids. I thought you couldn't mess up favorites like Frosty and Jingle Bells but I was wrong. The kids nor the adults could identify the songs based on the music. If you are looking for traditional music, which I was, then this is not the CD for you."
1,rippedoff,i never recieved item and put in claim and recieved no reply.vvgghhj jjhhg kkjj uytytr ghjk jhff kjjhjgh iuiuy ghjkj
2,Necessary Evil,"This must be a nice little profit generator for the company. It is nothing more than 4 BNC connectors connected to a ribbon cable. No active electronics whatsoever. Probably cost less than a dollar to make. But if you want the extra channels for your card, you don't have much of a choice except to buy this. Yeah, it works....but what a ripoff."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have purchased Attwood products in the past and have been generally happy with them. This is not the case with this drink holder. I searched around a bit to find a metal drink holder, in this style, because I have had that type before, and they work fine. I gave up trying to find a metal one and bought this one instead. I installed it and took out out for a test ride. The cup holder slips into the plastic mount. Unfortunately, there is no way to make it stay in the plastic mount. On the first bump the cup holder came out of the mount and Pepsi was everywhere. I guess I could use an industrial strength glue and permanently attach it to the mount, but I shouldn't have to. It should stay put together until I want to take it apart."
3,Seem ok... so far,"These were exactly what I was looking for design wise for my boat. I am a little bit skeptical about how long they will last though. The plastic does note seem as strong as it should be to hold a full drink. Installed 2 of them in my boat and will be giving them a test run tomorrow. Will update review after they get some use and I see how they hold up.*Update*These are holding up, but every once in a while the cup holder pops out of the u shaped piece it is connected to. They get the job done for the most part, but if you can find a better 1 that is a little more expensive, I would recommend going with that 1."
4,Good buy for the money.,I purchased this TV at walmart in my local town and am very pleased with its performance. The contrast ratio is 850:1 with the maximum resolution of 1440 x 900.
1,polaroid hemorrhoid,"dont want to even give it a star but maybe i should given that my $1000 flat screen polaroid 40"" lcd lasted a grand total of 23 months before going kaput. i must have gotten a ""good"" one judging from all the reviews ive read from multiple sites. shame on polaroid! i gave them a chance and now I am paying for their faulty design and virtually nonexistent customer service. everyone who is demanding a recall on these products is absolutely right. RECALL!-RECALL!-RECALL! jd"
1,Avoid this product and company at all costs!!,"I bought this TV with the built in DVD for my one year old son. The picture was decent in ths store and the price seemed right so we bought it right before Christmas. Within 3 months the DVD player stopped working. I contacted the company and was met with nothing but a series of transferred blame, followed by an offer for me to PAY to have it shipped to Califonia so they can take a look at it. No thanks! Avoid this product and this company at all costs. They do not stand behind their customers or their products. As a side note and only slightly less annoying, I also was going through 4 batteries a week to keep the remote working. What a waste of time and money."
1,didnt receive....want a refund!!!!!!!!!,"got sick for 11months other ppl took over hm never recieved this item. I wwant my card on file credited asap....i cant believe this. when i contacted my son he explained it never came, we moved within 2 wks because of my illness. were now in miami...."
1,DEFECTIVE PRODUCT,"Two years ago I purchased two(yep! 2) Polaroid, 19"" units (FLM-1911 to be exact). The display worked fine but the remote contol receiver failed on the first unit at eighteen months. By failing, I mean that it became ""Hal"" and changed channels, changed volume flipped between TV andr monitor mode and totally took control of itself. There was no stopping it! Polaroid said: tough - out of warranty. However, they did agree to ship me a refurbished ""similar"" unit for a mere $XXX which was about the discounted price of a new unit.I bit, they shipped. First the wrong control was shipped. When that was corrected, the unit provided proved to be unrepaired and would not work. A replacement for the replacement was provided. It never worked right either and I gave up and bought a different brand.At twenty-six months the second unit went into ""Hal"" mode! I said design problem! Polaroid said: tough - out of warranty but for a mere $XXX they offered to ship a refurbished unit...."
4,Good TV,"I owned this TV for a year, before it got stolen.It was a wonderful little TV, and had decent features you would expect for 19in at such a low price. Ratatoulie looked great on this little value.I probably would save up for a bigger TV next time."
1,bad buy!,TV quit tuning up and down after only a few months of use. From what I've read on-line this isn't a new problem with Polaroid TVs. Cust Service couldn't figure it out. Bad buy.
1,Dead In Three Months - Not Recommended,"This Polariod 19"" LCD TV worked great for approximately three months and then the screen suddenly stopped working after it is on for about 30-minutes. When it worked the picture was great and it had decent sound, which makes it that much more disappointing that it failed so quickly.Normally I would go into greater detail about the TV's features and overall performance, but it just doesn't warrant that much effort. Do yourself a favor and look at the large majority of negative reviews on this lemon before you consider buying it.Not Recommended!CFH"
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I have had my Polaroid for 2 year and now it does not work. The screen went blank. I can still hear it, but can not see anything. When this happened I looked online and MANY people are having the exact same problem. I'm a poor college kid who bought this tv to save space and money. I don't have any money to replace the tv so now I'm stuck. Do not buy this tv unless you want to throw your money away!"
1,Great Picture - Did I Go Deaf?,"We initially got this TV because it was priced right and it was a perfect fit for the kitchen - the standard television box just took up too much space on the counter. Initially, we loved it. It had a great picture and the sound quality was fine. After a few months, the sound started to cut out for brief periods of time and then cut back in. We thought it was our cable service - until we turned on a TV in the other room. The periods of time that the sound would cut off got increasingly longer in duration until - eventually - we had no sound at all. We contacted Polaroid. They wanted us to ship it back to them (paying for the shipping) PLUS send them $155. We weighed our options and opted to get a different TV for approximately the same amount of money as that would have cost us. So far, we're perfectly happy with our Vizio VA19L HDTV10T."
2,Hate this TV,"This TV was great when we first got it. Unfortunately, that was very short-lived. The sound is still okay, but the picture is completely shot. Colours are faded and there are permanent dark shadows on the screen. We have not caused any damage to the TV ourselves. Really disappointed in how this TV has deteriorated.I would not recommend a Polaroid TV to anyone. They are not well-made at all. Polaroid should stick to cameras, which they seem to know much better."
1,Do NOT buy a Polaroid TV,"I purchased two Polaroid TVs from Walmart (19"" HD LCD TV & DVD Combo) and a 33"" HD LCD TV & DVD combo). The 19"" will only display an image for 3 seconds and the 33"" had a dark streak in the center of the screen and the DVD play does not work at all). Walmart will not exchange (nor do they carry the crappy TVs) and Polaroid is non responsive."
1,Won't last long.,"I bought this TV 3 years ago at a big box store. 4 months ago it started to malfunction. It would turn on to just a white screen. I would turn it off then back on again, the picture would be there but no sound. After turning off then on again it would come back on. Now a few months later, it won't turn on at all. Dead. I would assume that a TV should last longer. I have a Big tv in my living room that is 10 years old and still working without issue. This TV is crap when it comes to longevity. Buy something else. Considering how cheap other brand TVs of this size are now-a-days, I wont even bother trying to get it fixed."
3,Useful summary of years of newsletters,Useful info put into an easy to read form - Thousandas of recipes.
1,Total nonsence and marketing ploy,Assertions made by Dr. Mercola are not supported by any existing scientific evidence and serve no other purpose but to direct readers to his website in order to spend money on useless tests and products. Dr. Mercola was repeatedly warned by FDA to stop making unsubstantiated claims about his products. If you want to be healthy read some sound nutritional advice on Mayo clinic website. It is free!
3,Not Much New,"I think Dr. Mercola provides some valuable information, but overall, there wasn't a lot that was new. I get very frustrated at the conflicting information given in diet books, but will take the good information from this one to use in constructing a diet plan that works. I disagree strongly with a prior reviewer who felt the book was mostly a plug for Dr. Mercola's own products."
3,More like a cookbook,"The information in the first part of the book was ok- but it was mostly a cookbook, which was not what I was looking for"
3,Recipes for total health,"Most of what Dr Mercola prints or does is ground breaking and worth the time reading. Unfortunately for me this book fell alittle short of my expectations. The health information is very good, the recipes, honestly the average person will never eat. As a natural health consultant I know first hand what it's like to educate and help individuals attempt their quest for optimum health. Recipes is the most difficult because of the fast paced world we live in.I think there is a need for a more sensible approach to healthy recipes but I haven't found the book yet."
5,"Dr. Mercola's Total Health Program: the Proven Plan to Prevent Disease and Premature Aging, Optimize Weight and Live Longer by","Dr. Mercola presents practical, easy to understand information in his book; and, I believe the information will be very useful to me now and in the future."
2,healthly non-stick cookware? -not,"-bought the ceramic ""non-stick"" skillet. At medium heat cooked a fillet of salmon, no oil added. Well, the black junk that stuck to the bottom did not come off after scrubbing hard for a few minutes. This Xtrema product that he sells is definitely not a ""non-stick"" product.Beware!!!"
2,not the book I was looking for,"This book offers only a few pages about the effects of sugar in the human body -- not enough to inspire me to give it up. I had confused this with a book full of case studies where people throw away their prescriptions and pills and do just great after purging their diet of processed foods, chemicals and (darn it) sugar. This book is full of recipes I've not tried yet (make salmon a staple of my diet? I'm not there yet.) I didn't even try to figure out which body type I am (and which diet would best suit me: high protein, low fat, high carb, etc) because the questions require us to be so extremely observant and aware of what we eat and how it affects us. If I were already that good, I wouldn't need the book. This Dr Mercola book might be good for someone else but for me it wasn't what I was looking for."
2,Not a good as I thought it was going to be,It's a very simplistic overview of metabolic typing and a cookbook that one needs to be a professional chef and have hours available in order to cook in that manner in order to implement properly. could have been so much more of a resource if done differently. very disappointed. why did he write 2 books on much of the same topics in such a short period of time? makes no sense except revenue generation.
1,Waste of money,"This book is a total and complete disappointment.I ordered it because it claimed it had the metabolic type test, but all it does it to tell where to find the complete test - another book to buy. The test in the book consists of 9 questions. The real test is 60 and can be found in Wolcott's book - ""The Metabolic Typing Diet"". Of course, if you want, you can call Dr. Mercola's office and they will be happy to perform the real test for you (and the consequential personalized plan) for the amount of $179USD...This book is like an advertisement of Dr. Mercola's website and his on-line store.There is noting the book that you can't find on the website or on the Internet - Google ""metabolic typing"".Do not buy this book, unless you are ready to spend at least $1000/mo for food (example from the book - grass-fed bison meat- like I did not know that this is a healthy choice?).Do not pay to read advertisement."
2,very dissapointing!!! wish I had not bought,I wish I had not bought this bad book full of garbage. It is just a plain old cookbook NOT A PROGRAM! Do not judge the book by its cover. His other book is actually a program unlike this book. I hope to attempt to return this book. Do not buy it unless it is less then 10 bucks ( not likely ). The other book called NO GRAIN is a lot better than this book of expensive toilet paper. You will be dissapointed if you buy this book!!!
3,A little overboard,Dr. Mercola is very knowlageble but you would have to be very rich or live on your ouw farm to follow his recommendations.
2,Disappointing,"I bought this thinking it was an information book, turns out to be a cookbook. The first 75 pages offer info that is not that interesting and the rest is how to cook healthy meals and buy more ""stuff"" from Dr. Mercola. I wouldn't waste my money unless you really need another cookbook."
3,Metabolic Test,"The book has some good general info. but the main reason I bought it was to take the test in the book to determine what my metabolic type was. If the test results proved inconclusive as mine did, you are then invited to purchase yet another book with a more detailed test, OR go to mercola.com and take the FULLclinical test for $179. I wish I had known this before I bought the book."
1,Highly Disappointed,"I highly regret purchasing this book and plan to return it. If I had reviewed it in a store before making an online purchase, I definitely would never have made the purchase. Rather than being a ""Total Health Cookbook and Program"" it is simply a cookbook, a rather poor cookbook at that. This book only contains roughly 5% Dr. Mercola's health program. The actual health program is in his book ""The No-Grain Diet."" ""Dr. Mercola's Total Health Cookbook and Program"" appears to be motivated by a desire to build upon the success of his earlier book. A more accurate price for this book would have been $12.95."
2,Dr Mercola's Totatl Health Recipe Book!,"Okay, I agree the book has some good information but I was a little mislead. I've read many of the same things in other books but what I didn't know is that the book is 75% cookbook and 25% actual reading material. I was disappointed with that and I did send the book back. If I wanted recipes I'd buy a cookbook. Just a warning to those who are expecting more.Also, the few questions you are asked that tells you if you have a protein, carb, or mixed ""metabolism"" you could figure out on your own. Nothing revolutionary here. I think the Mercola website covers most, if not more, of this information already. I wouldn't waste the money on the book."
5,UTTERLY BREATHTAKING IN HISTORICAL SCOPE AND ROMANCE,"Hard to believe this is only the first book from this exciting new author. She writes like a seasoned pro. Her historical knowledge of medieval Scotland woven seamlessly with a beautiful love story make this novel a must-have for any die-hard historical romance fan. This novel doesn't just sweep you into another time and place, it transports you there. You can smell the heather and be a part of the Celtic rituals. The love story between Challon and Tamyln - a love story that defied the time period - will make you believe that true love can surmount any obstacles. The author switches gears for her next novel - The Invasion of Falgannon Isle - by writing a contemporary. I, for one, know it will be another winner for my keeper shelf. I have no doubt Ms. MacGillivray could write the phone book and make it an award winning classic. Expect fabulous novels from this writer in the future - she won't disappoint."
3,"Average romance, a little long in places","I finally finished reading this one. I liked the beginning, which was exciting and suspensful. But then once the characters hooked up, I thought the story started to drag. I am not that interested in the details of ancient pagan holidays, what they wore, how they danced, etc. It's nice that the hero was willing to marry the heroine in the ancient way, but it didn't exactly translate to an exciting story. I wasn't impressed with the cousin's obsession, or that everything was willed by the ""Auld Ones"". It seems like the auld ones, whoever they are, would concern themselves with something more important than making sure Tamlyn gets a little nooky. It's not like life in the highlands proceeded happily ever after. Anyway, the plot was adequate and the descriptions were sufficiently descriptive. This book is a solid 3-star romance, and I can only attribute the constant stream of 5 star reviews to book-review grade inflation. Let's get real, people."
2,Not worth the time,"I tried to like it, but the characters are not engaging. I am a Dragon fan, but not of MacGillivray's writing style. Maybe she will mature and have some plot development"
1,Not a very well written book,"I give this book a one star. I read it with high hopes. But, this book lacked depth and character for me."
2,Huh?,"I was able to breeze through some of the more absurd parts, but these folks bathed too much for medieval Scotland!"
2,Extremely boring,"I rarely can't finish a book, but this one, wow, it took me a month to get through half and I am done. I will never buy another thing by this author, and I swear I've read this exact same plot elsewhere by a better author?"
1,Awkward,"I really wanted to enjoy this book. Unfortunately, that was far from the case. I am generally a fan of this genre (who doesn't love a Scottish accent?!?) but found the plot line to be boring and awkward. I did not feel there was any character development. The heroine was stupid and irritating and the hero overbearing and irritating. The paranormal aspects of this novel felt like they had been thrown in at the last second so that this novel could be classified as both paranormal and historical.I also found the writing style of this book to be unpleasant to read. The way and style in which a book is written have just as much (if not more) importance than the plot. Is this a high-school aged author? I am hoping this is an anomaly and that there are not multiple novels available that are this poorly written."
1,Very Boring,"I tried really hard to like this story. In the end, I didn't care about either the hero or the heroine. She was weak and he came off as a jerk. If I had as much power as Tamlyn is suppose to have, I would have turned Julian into a toad, warts and all. It would have been so much better if spells were cast, magical beasts were seen, and more acts of magic performed. But none of that occurred, leaving me very disappointed."
1,Made me restless to read another book,"This was a book from my TO BE READ pile and I finally got to reading it, It made me a restless reader since I kept reading only three pages and would get frustrated with the author's ideas about the power of destiny. It seems that the absurdities in the storyline have to be accepted because of destiny. I also did not care for the heroine Tamlyn, for a woman who comes from a clan that has empowered women, she is entirely too submissive and that turned out to be quite annoying. Another annoying idea in this novel was the clan traditions, the traditions got in the way of the romance and character development, due to this the actions of the characters were dictated by the traditions that it made the main couple seem like zombies to destiny (as you can see that again is my point of annoyance) that I did not care what ending was written for the character because destiny had already decided for them."
1,"Get if from the library, if at all.","I realize that some repetition of theme and storyline is an acceptable risk when one reads many books in a single genre. But the things that keeps me reading romance are the different twists an author takes on recycled stories and the individuality of the characters involved, which should never be recycled.I felt like I'd read these characters a million times before, heard the same cliched dialoge twice that much and really didn't care in the slightest what happened to any of them."
1,"Oof, couldn't even get halfway through this dreck.","My upstairs neighbor's a huge fan of romance. So when she recommended a 'great author with a lot of authenticity', I was tempted.Lo and behold, the book was written by Deborah MacGillivray. Unfortunately, none of the compliments applied to this book. I myself am equal parts Irish and Scot, and neither of the sides that liked authenticity could find much in the chapters I read...honestly, there's more authenticity in the spelling. I'm glad to see she can use a dictionary, but I'm sad to note she doesn't write very well. I couldn't get halfway through it----maybe a third at most, and I'm a voracious reader.I'm sorry I bought it, but I wasn't sorry when I tossed it in the barbecue pit. That made up for the fiver I spent."
5,"Historically accurate, but HOT","It is refreshing to find a historical author who really brings what is happening historically in a time period into the book. Edward I butchered the people of Berwick in 1296 and that nightmare is the basis for the hero's dream of wanting to find a peaceful place to live.However, Lord Julian Challon, the terrible Black Dragon of Long Shanks' army, finds anything but peace when he meets the fiery Tamlyn MacShane, whose property has been given to him by the king. She's not about to let a bloody Norman take her clan's home.Lots of SIZZLE in this story! Who said history was boring???"
1,Not as good as some previous books she wrote--in fact awful,"I won't repeat the plot synopsis since many have already done so and I'll keep this short. Deborah MacGillivray has written some good books, but this is not one of them. I agree totally with the reviewer who mentioned this was like a poor copy of Elizabeth Lowell's Untamed. Don't waste your money."
1,SCIMMABLE READ,"NOT SOMETHING I'D GO OUT OF MY WAY TO GET.SEEMED LIKE IT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE TIGHTLY WRITTEN, AND I FOUND MYSELF SKIMMING THE BOOK ABOUT MIDWAY THROUGH (I MADE THE JOKE TO MYSELF THAT NOT ONLY WAS IT ""A RESTLESS KNIGHT"" BUT ""A RESTLESS READER.)"
1,Not one i'll be going back to,"Personally i thought this book was awful and overused. I even tried to read another of the authors books, hoping that this was just a miss, but they all seem to be the same- not terribly creative, some seriously overused plots, awful dialogue, and nothing new or interesting. Personally in this book i hated Julien- hated his attitude, hated the way he treated everyone- if i wanted to read a 'true to life' book about how men treated women, i'd have went to the nonfiction section.And, just as a side note, isnt it weird that all the people that give this book great reviews are in this authors book club, and thanked in her book for their support. And, also, how a lot of negative reviews seem to be disappearing? Either someone is a little to staunch a supporter, or the authors book club is being a little nefarious."
1,I really tried...,"I tried. I really really tried to read this book. I forced myself to read more than half of it, but then I had to give up. The plot was boring and I felt like I have read it a billion other times in a billion other boring books. The dialogue was awful, the characters were flat."
3,Missing in action,"I had read a negative review prior to ordering and frankly exactly the same problem happened. Product arrived in a box totally destroyed. The frame was not damaged, but half the nuts and bolts were missing. I called Amazon and told them about the problem and that I would keep the item and purchase nuts and bolts myself. They reimbursed me $30 to cover my car gas and the nuts and bolts. Outstanding response by Amazon, but the manufacturer has a real problem with shipping."
1,Missing pieces,"The box this product came in was almost completely destroyed. Pieces were missing, it was unusable.Amazon return went very smoothly! Thanks for that."
1,disapointing version of a grand romantic ballet,"I've seen Bessmertmova's Giselle on this video and on stage, simply disapointing. Since she was Bolshoi's former director Grigorovich's wife, it's easy to understand why she was the Bolshoi's ultimate Giselle and Odette, there were so many dancer's much better than this one,(Maximova, Kolpakova,Osipenko). Besmertnova has no technique, and artistically she's always herself,sad and melancholic,(and don't miss her unproportioned,huge hands!makes her port-de-bras always out of line, wrist-cracked). My favorite one? Alessandra Ferri,she's superb!"
5,iam 10 and a huge star wars fan name dash rendar,hi yeall i wrote a review of the sound track go see it i played it star wars:shadows of the empire on N64 and i hated it and i bought it on pc and was amazed i love how it supports 3D card and top computer (cause i have one just bought it with this) and i keep playing if your a hardcore fan like iam get it if your not try it your sure to be plezed.
4,The Atlas of Pern by Karen wynn fonstad,When I opened the package the first thing I noticed was the smell of burnt paper. When I pulled the book out the paper covering pulled apart. Over the next 3-4 hours first a corner of the outer layer of the hardcover just fell off and peices kept falling off for the few hours while reviewing several portions of the book. I have come to the conclusion that the book was submitted to a fire and wetting == very miminal but some damage was done. By the way there is not way this book could be considered a paperback!
5,Answers questions about the size and shape of Pern,"This book is constructed as a series of maps, but each map is followed by a little bit of related information from the novels. There are detailed drawings of the Weyrs, Holds, and Halls. Finally you can see how a Hatching ground is laid out"
5,Very pleased,"This is a very useful book, and a perfect companion for the Dragonlover's Guide to Pern. Not only does it show close up maps of where various Holds, Weyrs, and Crafthalls are located, but it also has maps of some of the events from the books, such as the path Moreta took, and F'lar's infamous battle with Fax. I'd highly recommend this book for any fan of Pern."
3,Needs Updating,"This is an informative book, but looking at the copyright date of 1984 and the introductory note by Anne McCaffrey dated 1984 you have to realize that anything in the books after Moreta: Dragonlady of Pern (published in 1983) will not be on the maps.I looked at the map of the area around Ruatha Hold and did not see the ford which the party that populated the hold had to cross in order to get there from Fort Hold and which Ruatha Hold was named for (Rua Atha meaning Red's Ford after Red Hanrahan, a character in Chronicles of Pern: First Fall(1993) and one of the original colonists.)Get the book if you want to see some of the earliest references of places on Pern, but do not expect all of the places mentioned in all of the books to be shown. A bit of a let down but to be expected considering the year it was published."
5,Best Book For Learning the Serger,"This book is EXCELLENT for all serger users especially for NEW users. It shows clear, color pictures of how the stitches should look when stitched correctly and when they're wrong and how to change the tensions to correct the stitch. If you're a new user, you have no idea how the stitch should look and this book clears that up. I am a serger guide teacher and I recommend this book to all my students. Finally a book worth the money!"
5,Great beginners book,"I actually bought this book while I was trying to decide which serger I wanted to buy (since it details features available in the many types of machines) - and now that I actually have the serger it is even more helpful. It is great for a beginner because it details how to fix tension problems, which is something I think everyone new to serging has problems. It also tells how to do many simple decorative techniques. I will definitely be using this book as a reference even though I do not own a Singer serger. Lots of pictures, lots of color. A great book to go with your serger manual."
4,Lots of Photos,"This book is similar to all the Singer sewing series books. It has many color photos that allow you to compare your serging efforts to the samples. It also has step-by-step construction guides for several projects. I would have preferred more indepth coverage for the novice serger user. For example, I'm still fuzzy on creating a rolled hem. If you plan to buy several books, this is a good choice. I'm not sure it can stand alone if you have many questions."
5,"Solid, approachable book","This solid book covers all of the basics and provides enough theorems and lemmas to satisfy the theoretical foundations of this topic. I would call this book a good preparatory work for students in a masters program prior to taking graph theory. The overview that it provides is both easy to understand and approachable to many levels including undergrad. Also, if you are a programmer, it is good for theories of A* pathing and networking."
4,It should have been longer,"The BBC's Love in a Cold Climate, based on the Nancy Mitford novels The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate, tell the stories of three young girls from aristocratic backgrounds: Fanny, Linda, and Polly, as they struggle to live life and find love amongst a changing world.The production values of the series are wonderful, but the script needed to be MUCH longer. Screenwriter Deborah Moggach tried to fit too many events into a two and a half hour timespan. There was obviously a reason Mitford divided the story into two books. One leaves the film feeling quite rushed.However, wonderful performances from Rosamund Pike as Fanny and Elisabeth Dermot-Walsh as Linda. There are some quite funny moments."
5,A wonderful insight into the lives of a memorable family,"The characters in Love in a Cold Climate are so believable and even with their flaws very lovable. The acting is superior and the story line is so interesting you can't wait to see what happens next. The story follows the lives of several girls who are dear friends who go through the joys and tragedies of life. The venues are a country estate in England, London, Paris and Russia....a sweeping saga. I love watching it and every time I have more insight into the characters. Definitely a movie you will want to watch more than one time! Rosamund Pike and Elizabeth Dermot-Walsh are marvelous as well as all the supporting characters. A must see for those who enjoy period movies!"
3,Need to Watch A Love Story? This Isn't It!,"Three good friends from rich families. Well, at least two of them are. There were a couple of funny scenes, other than that, I thought it was a relatively dark kind of movie. There's untimely death and unwanted motherhood and I just felt ""low"" after watching it.That's all I'm going to say for this movie. I wouldn't watch it again.Sincerely,Nancy"
2,English upper class twits acting like English upper class twits,"Few chins are in evidence and even less backbone in this pallid dramatization of one of the Mitford sisters' (I forget which one, they are all so wacky) semi-autobiographical novels. I love BBC period dramas in general but this one was not among the strongest I've seen. There is no real dramatic arc. It's just one thing after another.There are three women at the center of this piece -- Linda who marries a fascist, a communist and then falls for a French nobleman. Fanny, the narrator, who is normal and marries some boring Oxford don and Polly is -- actually don't remember what the hell happens to her.Anyway, there are costumes and lovable British eccentrics and all the rest -- but it turns out pretty boring."
1,"Couldn't even finish, it was so silly","At least the author's impressed with herself--she quotes herself in her preface. Badly written, barely edited, this book smells of ""vanity press"". Sorry I wasted my money on it."
2,OK READ,This book was ok but it could have been better. the stories were too short each story was only about 2 to 3 pages long so you get very little info.on the places and ghost. This book was easy to put down and pick up again the next day it just did not keep me wanting to read like other books.
3,What's the difference,"It's an OK wok. But, don't expect miracles. Despite all the marketing superlatives about the non-stick surface, this one started to peel in spots like my other Calphalon pans. Oh well..."
2,Overpriced Wok,"I bought this wok back in 2004. Like the other reviewers, I found this wok to be quite heavy.After seeing good reviews for the ""Cuisinart GreenGourmet Hard Anodized Eco-Friendly Nonstick 12-Inch Stir-Fry Wok with Glass Cover"" and that the surface was made of ceramic-based nonstick coating (PTFE/PFOA-free and petroleum-free), I bought the Cuisinart wok and have been using it ever since. Food on the Cuisinart wok comes off much easier then the Calphalon One Nonstick. So, I plan to donate the Calphalon wok after using it for about 6 years."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with the book and CD. I expected it to be easier to implement. I expected a CD that my daughter and I could listen to w/o the use of the book. But for my daughter to understand what the words mean, she would have to sit with the book. This is coming from someone who grew up speaking Spanish."
4,Fun for years to come,"I'd been searching for something like this and was so happy to get it and my 2.5 year old loves it too. He's at the age when he's just soaking up Spanish. (And now my neighbor is teaching him conversational Russian, as well.) I am a full time mom and I do agree with another review that this seems to be geared toward home learning. All of the situations occur in our day to day and it's nice to hear, read & repeat all of the phrases. I usually listen, pause, repeat, then play some more. Great for rainy days and also nice to just play through and listen to -- it has short little songs peppered in."
5,A great resource,I homeschool my kids and I'm always looking for great language resources for Spanish and French for them. This is a winner! I use this book andSpanish for Little Boystogether for my 2 sons. Both of them keep them interested and focused on learning a new language! And that is saying a lot!
1,Way too much information for beginners,"I bought this book to teach a class of 9 students. This book is very useless for the class. There is way too much information in each chapter, there is nothing for the students to work on throughout the week, and the cd is poorly made. I'm very disappointed."
4,For the daily caregiver,"This is an excellent tool but it is not the most useful if you are NOT the basic caregiver of the student. It is set up to wake the child, wash him, have breakfast, get dressed, etc. all done with Spanish songs and expressions, as you would do as the parent in English. But as a teacher, you would have to ""act out"" these scenarios- if you are not the one who oversees his daily activities. I am teaching my grandsons. It was fun for them to pretend they were waking up or dressing to go outside in the hot/cold weather, but it was not frequently repeated (and therefore reinforced) because I am not part of these routines. Accordingly, this is most useful for a parent who wants to introduce Spanish smoothly into a child's daily life, raising them ""as if"" bilingual."
1,Not for beginners or young children,"It's touted as the fun way to get kids started, but it's a book on tape without even signals after each page. The dialogue was too fast and there's no explanation or instruction, just spanish dialogue printed next to English translation. If your child isn't a fluent reader, forget it.It'd be good for an older child or adult already learning Spanish who wanted to work on pronunication."
2,Not quite for teachers in the classroom,"I was kind of frustrated when I opened the book and found out that it is quite oriented in its format to parents at home. It does not have a design for use in the classroom. I do not recommend it for Spanish language teachers, unfortunately.Thank you"
1,terribly dissapointed,"I loved the first edition of this book/cd so was very excited to see the second edtion. The second edition is a complete waste of money. don't buy it; buy the first edition instead if you can find it! The second edition is missing all the songs, which are the best part. The only way you can hear them is by going to your computer!! It's ludicrous! Who can go to their computer? It's meant to be listened to in the car while you're driving or with a cd player while following along in the book. I am a spanish teacher, have five kids and have tried to teach them a lot ofspanish. This second edition is useless but the first is great."
3,Its' ok so far.,"Bought this item for my daughter , who said she would like to learn Spanish. And I had to find and easy , reasonably priced Spanish learning tool for and 8year-old . And I thought this would be a good start ."
1,Not yet received the item,I have not received this item yet. Its been over a month since I placed the order. Is it not available?
3,its ok,"I was disapointed that the CD & the Book don't match up very well. The lessons aren't even in the same order & some of the songs are missing words in the book.The CD doesn't seem like it was meant to go with the book at all, nor does the CD help with learning words. It would only be benificial if your child knows the majority of the words already."
4,Spain Spanish,"No doubt it's noted but was missed by me: Ana & Co. utilize the Spanish of Spain, meaning very different vocabulary and pronunciation (the constant th=theta makes my kids giggle and ask ""what's that??"") from the words and sounds most of the continent of America is accustomed to.Ana's voice is wonderful, deep and resonant, but the adult she has pretending to be a child with her on the cd sounds just that, a grown-up faking toddler-speak; which ends up quite annoying for some of us."
2,Too complex,"Not good as a primary text for teaching Spanish at home. Songs are very complicated with lots of difficult vocabulary, while children may learn to sing a song they certainly are not going to know what it means. I am going to be looking for something else to use - very disappointed since some of the other reviewers suggested this would be a good tool to use at home."
3,I don't like the voice of speakers...,"I really like the words, and songs in this book.But I don't like the voice of speakers... sounds like they are not professional voice actors. They are pretending a mother and a kid, but their voice are not. I wish they use real kid's voice.To me, their voice are awful..."
5,Excellent Spanish Book,I am a Spanish teacher and the kids are excited any time I use this book. Excellent game book. Thanks!!
3,Beginning Spanish,Mc Graw Hill -- Has a Good Education Concept.The subject matter is good for Kids to Adults.We thought the dialogue was much to fast for someone beginning to speak Spanish.The CD Recording: If the company would slow down the speaking rate to the natural speaking rate between a Mother & Child and then record with an adult & child voice we think this product would greatly improve.The book provides a good primary reading book at about the 2nd or 3rd grade reading level.
3,Something just was'nt right,Love Diana Palmer and I enjoyed Paper Rose so I went out and bought this one. I thought that it was a little to long. All the ingredients were there for a great romance but I just couldn't feel the emotion like in many other Diana Plamer books.
4,enjoyable read,"a very enjoyable read, as I generally enjoy a Diana Palmer book and have read many. this was fun and I always like the happy ending!"
1,right...,"um i dont mean to be mean but this book kinda made me ill. i dont like to judge people but pierce or whatever the heros name is hes really disgusting i mean its almost the end of the book and hes screaming out the name of his wife yes we know that he loves her already do we have to hear this every other page. heres some adivice to the hero get some therapy. i dont believe he loved the heroinne i think he just settled for having a mrs right now instead of a mrs right you know? he loved his wife till the very last page but he decided to stay with the heroine cause he ""loves"" her, im sorry i must have missed something..."
1,Extraordinarily distasteful,Pierce is like so many of Palmer's leading men an arrogant and distasteful human being. I would have long ago told him to take a long walk off a short pier. I can not understand Palmer's popularity.
3,Once In Paris,I gave my daughter this book for christmas. She said it was OK. It was delivered in a timely manner.
1,NOT A VERY GOOD BOOK,DIDNT LIKE THIS BOOK AT ALL!! THE HERO PIERCE HUTTON SPENT SO MUCH TIME WHINING ABOUT HIS DECEASES WIFE YET IT DIDNT STOP HIM FROM SLEEPING WITH HEROINE BRIANNE DID IT? I JUST GOT SO DISGUSTED WITH HIM FOR BEING SO BACK AND FORTH AND BRIANNE FOR NOT GETTING UP ANS SLAPPING HIM FOR IT. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK.
2,Is this really Palmer ?,"As Diana Palmer's #1 fan I was disapointed in this book. Pierce was not the normal sexy, masculine hero that's usually in Palmer books, instead he came across as kind of weak and whinny. There was also too much talk of war, and the chemistry between Pierce and Brianne just wasn't up to Diana's usual standards."
2,Surprisingly disappointing,"First, I just want to say that I love Diana Palmer. She is fabulous and fun, one of my favorites. This book was NOT Diana Palmer material. It is about a young girl who falls in love with an older man and waits a year for him until he over comes his wife's death. In the meantime, Brianne's horrible step father promises her hand in marriage to someone else and Brianne will do everything she can to keep from marrying this evil man, with the help of Peirce if he gets over his wife's death. I could hardly stand Pierce for he was boring, self centered and childish. And though Brianne was not as naive as one would think, she was still not a very bright young woman. I found the plot somewhat weak, even though Ms. Palmer snuck in a few surprises with the oil companies and wars and etc. I found Tate Winthrop more exciting than anyone in this book and he was hardly in it!! I know the next book I read by her will be much better. I am not giving up on her! :)"
5,Chiller,"A little slow at first. But then I realized that its just super realistic. If you want to unlock the basement, you need to dig around for a key, and so on. It creeped me out a few times, which normally doesn't happen, and I thought the added ending was a good touch for the Director's Cut."
4,I loved the adrenaline rush,"This was a great game though if you're not big on being scared then this probubly isn't the game for you. Another thing about it is the ending is a little confusing and you don't completly understand what happened. You also don't get an answer like you do to murder mysteries (there's always a killer), but here there's no resolve, but maybe you disagree. I loved the game and you should find out your self weather or not you like it. Me, I loved the adrenaline rush."
1,Be Aware of the Game Requirements,"Be aware of the technical requirements for Scratches Director's Cut. The game requires a graphics card that supports Open GL. Not all graphics cards do. In fact, I know of very few that do. Without an appropriate video card, the game is virtually unplayable. I did not find the tech specs here on Amazon, so I only saw them once the box arrived. Nucleosys has posted several workarounds on their site. They may word for you, they didn't for me.The Open GL requirement only exists, as far as I know, for the Director's Cut version of the game. The original should play well on almost any card. But you won't get the bonus material."
2,What happened to the 'End of the Story'???,"It was a very difficult game to get anywhere. It hung up all the time and then you had to start over. Every once in a while you would stumble over something and think, ""Great, now we're getting somewhere!"" alas, then it went back to boring and repetitive. I will say that it was 'spooky'. And I really wanted to know the ending. I did finish it and then sat there and wondered how it ended. It just seemed to run out of steam and a lot of the things that seemed so interesting were just dropped. Never explained or 'wrapped up'. It was like taking on a complicated jigsaw puzzle and getting to the very end only to find that too many pieces are missing to complete it satisfactorily.Maybe I'm too critical or expect too much but I thought the ending would be a WOW rather than something so mundane."
1,Won't no download,I have tried several times and I could no get this game to download on my computer. I kept making the screen go black.
2,Harry Potter,The book talked a lot about running bits and was a little annoying to keep reading. I wish it was more like the Ultimate Unofficial Guide to the Mysteries of Harry Potter analysis of books 1-4. This book wasn't as fun or as interesting to read.
3,Not as inciteful as 1st,"I really enjoyed the Books 1-4 version of the Unofficial Guide, so I was somewhat disappointed in the latest edition. The layout was not nearly as good as the previous volume, and I was also disappointed in their predictions, especially after reading Half Blood Prince."
4,The perfect blend of Gothic/Idustrial music,"I have heard a lot of new Darkwave bands, but this album has it all"
2,Gramatica de la Lengua Inglesa,"I find this book quite difficult for the spanish-speaking adult student who I am working with. Any spanish-speaking person would need a high level of education in his own language to comprehend the explanations and directions. My student is perhaps educated through grade school.This would be a good book for someone who is advanced in the spanish language.There are lines for answers, but they are close together, perhaps college-ruled or closer, so the handwriting would have to be fairly small.A good point about this book is that the answers are in the back.There are 127 pages of workbook pages, then there are two appendices and the answers, and one page of an index. Total pages: 143"
1,not for beginners,"I purchased this book to assist in tutoring English to native Spanish speaking children in the upper grades of grammar school. Expecting something similar to the wonderfully clear and well-organized workbooks I have used in learning Spanish, I was disappointed. This book is for those advanced in grammar and fairly advanced in English and looking to refine their English language skills. Each lesson is two pages, thus lacking in sufficient groundwork and exercises. Advanced grammar, such as past perfect, indirect objects and passive voice, are covered in the first few lessons. This is just not useful for my purposes."
5,Calphalon One Nonstick 12-inch Fry Pan,I use this pan for so much of my cooking but mainlyfor frittas. They come out perfect.The pan with the glass lid are so easy to hand wash.
4,Excellent product,"This 12 inch pan is easy to use, especially with the helper handle. Clean up is easy. Be sure to pick up the glass lid, too."
5,excellent quality fry pan,I'm very pleased with the quality of this fry pan. Someone who likes to cook with top of the line cookware would appreciate the value of such an essential piece in their kitchen.
2,The Priests,"The PBS presentation of this concert was excellent. However, the DVD is flawed by extremely bad camera work. When changing camera angles the subject's head can be distorted into bizarre contortions. It was quite unsettling. I watched it once but probably wont see it a second timeIf I play it again I'll use it as a CD and not look at it. That's unfortunate because the setting is a major part of the attraction.Sorry. It's not very good."
4,Nice singing,"Nice music,nice singing, not much visual pleasure while three handsome prists performed classic stuff on a stage."
1,Priests at Armagh,All three copies I ordered were defective and I returned them and received notification that I would be issued a credit to my account.
1,Disappointing,I purchased this product at the same time as the CD entitled The Priests. I assumed I was purchasing their latest CD but when the product arrived it was a DVD. That is NOT what I thought I was ordering. Make sure you know you will be getting a DVD!!!
5,Superb and heartlifting music!,"The Three Priests have a superb blending of voices on this CD of religious music. Several pieces are sung in Latin which gives added beauty to the singing. Performed in Ireland, they are joined by the Irish Philharmonic Orchestra, the New Dublin Voices Choir, the St Patrick's Cathedral Choir, and gives special thanks to St Patrick's Catholic Cathedral Armagh. It is a treasury of beautifully sung music, and is highly recommended to anyone who is a serious music lover."
1,Get another book,"What a disapointment ! Nice photos but overall not precise, vague. The text does not explain in details how to do a posture or its benefits.I wasted my money, go for another book!"
3,Posture Alignment,"Not enough posture alignment emphasis. I would recommend that instead of using pictures of real people practicing, have illustration sketches showing ""ideal"" posture alignment instead. I don't meant to criticize those in the pictures. They do have decent practice, but I some times practice with the 2 time Bikram World Champion Cynthia in San Jose, CA; and I have seen what ""ideal"" look like."
1,photos of poses are often incorrect,"I wanted a book to show the IDEAL pose, so I'd know what to work toward. Here, many of the photos of the poses are actually incorrect when compared to the dialogue of Bikram. AS stated in an earlier review, these are yoga students, not champions, but I'd like to see, as do you I'm sure, what the pose looks like when executed with precision and expertise. Most beginners would not even realize what was incorrect about the photos (hence, all the good reviews), but after years of Bikrams dialogue drummed into my head, I am quite surprised that she even published these photos. If you are looking for a book to help you with an activity you can do at home, alone, in your own time, please know that it would NEVER substitute for a regular practice in a studio. Plus,I have no idea how one would learn yoga from a book. Save your $, and use it on a class instead :)"
3,Average,"This is a good basic resource for beginners. It focuses on technique without the additional stories and side chatter found in ""Bikram's Beginning Yoga"" book."
1,Messed Up!!!!!!!!,"Ok yes I know that most people said they enjoyed this book. And i guess when i first started it I thought it was aight....but then i got in to it and I mean come on she sat there and let him practically rape her and if she had struggled she could have gone to the police but instead she just lied there. I ahve no problem with the kissing scene inbetween Josh and Jeremy but then i thought ok now r they like ""partners"" and I just couldnt get why if he started to leave in the first place he came back.My advice would be to get some one who really understood this book to help explain it because i was majorly confused!"
3,Mediocre,"This book isn't bad, but it's not good either. Being the first of the seven books in the Sevens series, I felt that in the beginning you are dropped into a scene you wouldn't understand. After the first 3 chapters, it begins to make sense. These books follow seven teens through the problems they're having (and all of them are far-fetched, and don't seem likely to happen to seven people who used to be freinds) and each chapter bounces back and forth between the seven, but this book mainly focuses on Meena. Meena is babysitting one night when she is physically - and mentally - assulated by the father of the child. Because of that, she falls into depression, drops the swim team, and her grades plummet. This book is OK, but not very realistic, and for the book to make complete sense, you have to read the other six books, which are mediocre too."
3,Keep reading..,"I think this book was only ""okay."" At first, I really didn't like it, but it is very captivating, so I kept reading. Which is good, because the other books in the series are much better than the first one."
4,great story,"Susan Butcher lead an amazing life, which ended too soon. Video great introduction to her life, wish it would be updated."
4,"Good Filter,,But...........","Frams filters are very good you really can't go wrong. The only thing I found out later is that it is much cheaper at Kragen or almost any auto parts store, but good filters"
5,Dr. Adrian Rogers -- Unveiling the End Time in Our Time,I highly recoomend this book as a bible study resource. An excellent read...Dr. Rogers has shared some very pertinent bible teaching in this book.
2,Dissapointed...,"I always hate doing this to my own brethren but I could only get through an hour of this outline. Wordy, confusing and dry."
5,Excellent resource for English-as-a-Second Language teachers,"This is the resource book all ESL teachers need; it explains all those little nuances of pronunciation and usage that we intuitively know but cannot explain. I have based several lessons on a single entry; my high school students are excited to be able to correct errors in their language skills, because they finally understand WHY something is done a certain way. This text is well-organized, easy to access and highly user-friendly!"
3,Good Value for the money,For the price they charge it is a good value. I must admit it was chincier than it looks in the picture but for the money was still a good deal. The bag lasted about 8 months before everything in the bag started getting little black flecks on it. The inner lining was disintegrating. Within a year it was completely unusable. If you just need something for right now and don't plan to use it a long time it is worth the money.
2,"Nylon Bag, Cheaper Than Indicated","Not enough space for 1 average sized textbook and notebooks. I just needed a cheap bag that would hold my daughters papers, and the occansional textbook she might bring home. After the first week, she stopped using this bag and got a new one."
3,This bag is ok,"The bag overall is ok, but the seam came out in the organizer pouches as soon as I opened the bag. Everything else seems ok."
5,very useful,"I use this bag everyday at work and it handles all my throwing it in the car and flipping it open, it has even survived my dog rumaging through it for food, and eating the bottom off the bottle holder on the side, but it still holds bottles, even with the bottom gone!"
3,Well...,"I got the bag and I like it. It is big enough for all my stuff. It is comfortable to carry even when it is full enough to be heavy. My only problem was my zipper on the organzier part was messed up.It wasn't enought of a big deal to return it I managed to fix it. Occasionally things can happen.UPDATE 1/4/2012: After having this bag for a few months I am now a little disapointed the velcro has messed up/frayed the organizer part so now my pens & pencils are starting to fall through, I washed it once on the gentle cycle and the inside lining has started to come out and the zipper now no longer works at all."
5,An excellent teaching tool,"I'd definitely recommend this book if you're a teacher or a parent of pre-kindergarten children. The book provides tons of great ideas which help make the kids' learning experience enjoyable, and the clarity and structure provided make things easy on the adults. My class really enjoyed the activities which I drew from this book."
5,Nice book for the money,"A friend made the ice cream from that book. Everyone wanted the recipe, thus the book was what we were told to buy. Cant wait for it to warm up for a batch."
2,"Good Book, But...","This book was written quite a few years ago. Something I didn't realize when ordering it to go with a new ice cream machine I had just purchased. A lot of the recipes called for eggs which remained raw, as the recipe was a no cook one. While the flavors looked great and it was well written, the raw eggs were a deal breaker."
3,Pretty Good Recipes,"The majority of the recipes are nice, but some included raw eggs which didn't sit well with my family and I. I actually contacted the maker of my icecream maker and asked about raw eggs in an icecream recipe and they did not approve. Other than that, It's nice."
2,I so wanted this book to work,I love Ben & Jerry....but this book doesn't cut it. I wish it did. There are better master recipes out there to add the flavour combinations to.
5,Easy to make ice cream,"These are all simple, easy to follow recipes. Even better than the recipe book that came with my ice cream maker. My first batch of ice cream was Cherry Garcia. WONDERFUL!!"
5,Must have book for anyone with an ice cream maker!,"I recently got an ice cream maker and had to get a good book with easy recipes. This book is it! Simple and very few ingredients with easy instructions make this book a keeper. My first ice cream (Jerry's Chocolate) was just amazing. Smooth, creamy and the taste was out of this world. I was so impressed that the very next morning I made a batch of Butter Pecan to have after dinner tonight.I know many people have issues with raw eggs though they do have alternative methods in this book. Another option I suppose would be egg beaters. I personally use raw eggs since I have no issue with them. I have eaten hundreds of raw eggs and have never gotten ill but do get food poisoning at least once a year from chain restaurants- go figure since we hardly ever eat out!"
5,Just good ice cream,"We've tried almost all of the recipes in this book and haven't found a one yet that isn't delicious. They aren't quite as creamy has the custard style ice creams found in other books, but still much better than anything you can get at the store (including Ben and Jerry's). These are the recipes to have if you want something quick and easy."
5,Common sense ice cream making and more!,"This is a fantastic book on making ice cream. The recipes are great, and they even tell you a bit about the science in making ice cream. They even give you ideas on how to create your own special flavor. Also included are good recipes for other desserts. If you want to make ice cream go with the folks that really know how to make ice cream."
5,?,"i'm dying to try out lots of these recipites. so far i haven't had a chance, we just made plain ol vanilla."
4,Good basic recipes and some interesting history.,"Ordered this to go with the Cuisinart ice cream maker, and some day I may make some of the recipes (I had my own recipe that I planned to make and like it so much I haven't done anything else yet!). My only quibble with the book is that it has little in the way of less than full fat recipes."
4,Good Tasting Recipes with Fresh Ingredients Fun to Make,"Who doesn't like Ben and Jerry's premium commercial Ice-cream? The recipes in this book are for their familiar flavors and more. All ingredients are fresh and pure. There is plenty of unusual detail in the book. For example, who else bothers to mention that it takes some fresh lemon juice to restore a tanginess to the all too sweet flavor of over-ripened bananas in banana ice-cream?Unfortunately, Ben and Jerry are shy about providing techniques for refining the texture of the homemade version. But then why should they know them? They make ice-cream with commercial coolers. For refined techniques specific to homemade ice-cream, you will need to look elsewhere, like Liddle and Weir's ""Frozen Desserts""."
5,Spectacular recipes!,"This book contains spectacular recipes that produce incredibly tasty desserts. From hot apple cinnamon and raisin sauce to inventive sorbets and rich, creamy ice creams, every recipe I've tried has absolutely blown me away. I cook a lot and usually find that cookbook recipes are hit and miss, but this book is the exception. I have yet to find a recipe in it that doesn't knock my socks off. They also provide some key tips to successful ice cream making that are very helpful. The intro section is also surprisingly funny, adding a little extra to this wonderful book. I can't recommend it enough!"
5,One of the best!,"I have several books for making ice cream and I think the recipes in this one are the best. I wish they would write a new book as Ben & Jerry have come up with a lot of new flavors since 1987 that aren't in the book. I wouldn't normally make or buy coconut ice cream, but my daughter asked for it and it was delicious! I added almonds that I toasted myself (saute on a stove in a little butter with salt-drain on a paper towel) and it was even better! You don't need a bigger than a quart ice cream maker--just save the leftover ""batter"" in the refrigerator and make another batch later. The recipes do make much more than the book states."
5,Love it,I have made more ice cream in the past month than I have in years. And more different kinds. This book is great
3,ben and jerry ice cream recipes,"It has good recipes but I was concerned that they did not address whether the raw eggs should be slightly cooked before using. The internet sites said it should be combined with the heated cream, otherwise look for pastureized eggs in the supermarket (which I could never find)"
3,Worth it for the New York Super Fudge Chunk alone,"This has all the expected recipes in it, and is fun to read. However, you may have a problem with the ice cream forming ice crystals, since all of the recipes use raw eggs in their base, (problematic in itself) rather than the usual cooked custard. I made several of the ice creams, and the only that that was smooth and creamy was the NYSF--and my fiancee said he couldn't tell it from the real thing.I had the same ice crystal problems with the sorbets--I tried adding more sugar, less sugar, alcohol. Nothing worked until I learned you needed to cook a simple syrup--equal parts water/fruit--rather than just mixing the sugar with the fruit, as the book has you do."
2,Too much non-recipe related info,I was really disappointed in this book. The recipes are great but they are less than half of the book. There are way too many pages of the history of Ben & Jerry and not enough ice cream recipes.
5,Great Book,"It has all the great recipes plus the ones they only make at their flagship shop, such as Coffee Heath Bar Crunch and Cantalope. I also like their cute bio on how they got into ice cream.The recipes are easy and simple because they don't cook the eggs. If you worry about salmonella, just heat the custard mixture or coddle the eggs to kill any possible bacteria. As for us, we just use them raw.I use this in companion with my Kitchenaid Mixer Ice Cream Bowl attachment. The recipes make just the right amount for the mixer."
5,Ben & Jerrys Ice Cream recipies,"Great recipe book, easy to use, easy to make recipies. I use with my new Cuisanart Ice Cream Maker - everyone I have tried has been really good. I cut back on the heavy whipping cream to lighten them up a bit, but that is my preference."
4,"Good book, plenty of ideas",I liked the Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream book. The instructions were easy and the ice cream was very good. I also liked the history section where Ben and Jerry tell how they started their business. My only disappointment was the lack of a real vanilla bean ice cream. I can't wait to try many of the exciting flavors of ice cream and frozen desserts.
4,Niffy ice cream book,I bought this book based on the feedback I had read. The recipes are easy to understand and follow. You can get some neat ideas to add to your own recipes too. Over all I am very glad I bought it even though I probably won't ever make half of the ice cream flavors listed. If you have kids...they would love this book.
5,ice cream book,This book had a whole slew of great recipes. They were easy to follow and fun to make. Recommend it.
5,Only Ice Cream Book I Need,The brief intro of how B&J got their start was a fun read. I love the variety of ice creams you can make in this book along with sorbets! I've recommended this book to a few people already. But it if you are looking for a good ice cream book!
3,Fun to read but limited,"The short history of Ben & Jerry's at the start of the book is fun to read. The recipe selection leaves something to be desired. The vanilla ice cream recipe is easy to make but not nearly as good as a custard-based recipe. There's no discussion at all (in fact, the book sort of contemptuously dismisses) of low-cal substitutes for cane sugar such as Splenda, agave, stevia, etc. So if you don't mind blimping up, the recipe selection is fine."
2,OK review of ice cream cookbook,"After reading all the reviews of this Ben and Jerry's ice cream recipe book, I ordered it. I do not think it contains what I was looking forward to with the recipes contained therein., and would not order it again knowing its contents. I found that surfing the internet gave me the recipes I wanted - for example pistachio ice cream, peanut butter cup ice cream, etc."
3,It's ok if you don't mind RAW eggs,"I bought this book at the same time as buying my first ice cream maker. Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews first.Almost all of the recipes use uncooked eggs, which I would never serve to my children.I did modify one of the sweet cream base recipes that didn't call for eggs to make a chocolate ice cream. My daughters liked it ok, but I thought it was grainy.I've since started trying lots of other recipes and may try creating custard recipes from Ben and Jerry's ingredients.We did enjoy the history of Ben and Jerry's and the humourous anecdotes."
5,YUM!!!,"I ordered this book with a new ice cream maker and have loved the results. My favorite is Oreo Mint, and the people I have given a quart to as a gift have loved it too. Lot's of simple and delicious no cook recipies. I like that is has lots of proven favorites, as well as basic recipes to which you can add your own favorite combinations of flavors. One I made up used their basic recipe, but I added cinnamon and pecans. Unbelievably good. If you've got an ice cream maker - GET THIS BOOK!"
3,Disappointed,"Initially, I was very excited for this recipe book, but after reading it, I realized that none of the recipes with eggs had you cook them. - just mix the raw eggs and put them in the ice cream maker. No thanks. Don't think I will be able to use any of the base recipes. May use the interesting flavors with different bases from a different cookbook."
4,Good Gift for those who enjoy Ice Cream,This book is both an entertaining read and a good source of recipies. After making several of them (Oreo Mint is fantastic) I can say that it was worth it for the recipies alone. The background information about Ben & Jerry's is fascinating as well.
2,Look elsewhere,"Bought this book with my new Cuisinart ice cream maker (see review). Thought the ice cream maker was mediocre after using ice cream recipes from this book (haven't tried the sherbert or sorbet recipes yet). While the book had good ideas, the ice cream tasted just OK. Tried a few other recipes with similar results. Again, blamed the machine. Then we hit on Christopher Kimball's recipe in the Desert Bible. At last, great ice cream. Not icy, but creamy. Full of flavor. Takes a bit more work than the recipes in this book, but worth it.Buy it for ideas to use with other recipes."
2,Some Recipes are Outdated,"I purchased this book along with an ice cream maker for a young adult. While the book is attractive and nicely illustrated to appeal to a young audience, I was disappointed to see that many of the ice cream recipes incorporate raw eggs. This is an outdated practice - raw eggs haven't been used in recipes for at least 20 years because of the risk of salmonella . The ice cream recipes using raw eggs in this book need to be updated or at least include a warning of risk of salmonella contamination inserted."
1,health safety problem,"I love Ben and Jerry's ice cream but am very disappointed in this book. It includes a basic recipe mix that calls for egg but doesn't call for cooking the mix. Raw eggs always represent a potential health problem and freezing doesn't make eggs safe. Any ice cream recipe that includes egg should specify either using pasturized eggs or cooking the mixture and then cooling it completely before churning. Beyond the basic mix recipes, this book is mostly about crushing various things, like cookies and candy, to add to the basic recipe. I don't need a book for this."
2,"rich, rich, rich","These recipes are incredibly rich; my lips were greasy after trying a basic vanilla recipe. I love ice cream, and I love decadent ice cream. However, I felt like I was eating butter after trying this out."
3,"Umm, RAW eggs! Nope not never","Oh boy, hind site is 20/20! I should have read the reviews BEFORE I bought the book. Nice ideas, as far as the stir in's -a nice varity of flavors. BUT they call for RAW eggs, I can't do it. My Mom is fighting cancer for the 3rd time and to risk the introduction of raw eggs into her diet could be a death sentence. There are other people in our lives who too must avoid bacteria, we all should. This book really needs to be pulled off the market, or revamped with a new base recipe! I kid you not. Such a shame for this book"
1,Disappointed,"I bought Ben & Jerry's Book hoping that they would have their Pistachio Pistachio Ice Cream recipe included in it. Sadly, it's not in there. I'm SOOOO disappointed!"
1,Raw eggs? NO.,"This book is well done, interesting BUT in this day and age, no one should encourage eating raw eggs and that is exactly what the recipes do - nowhere do the authors mention COOKING the raw eggs for their basic ice cream recipes.I won't make any recipe using raw eggs without cooking them.Too bad, the book is entertaining and informative.I want a refund, please."
2,Ben & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream & Dessert Book,Very good publication. Many recipes and ideas. Bought it to go with an ice cream maker for a bridal shower gift. Everyone loved the idea!!!!
3,Not quiet what I expected but it is still nice!,I guess I was expecting more cookbook style recipes but hearing the back story and all that of Ben and Jerry was interesting too.
5,Love this book!,There are so many wonderful sounding recipes for ice cream and other items as well. I can't wait to try some of them out!
5,Ice Cream Chef,"I bought the Cuisinart 2 quart Pure Indulgence ice cream maker. I have made vanilla, eggnog, coffee, oreo, chocolate chip & chocolate ice cream. Absolutely Fab. My only suggestion is buying the pasteurized liquid eggs. I make ice cream every week & my family loves all the recipes."
4,Boyfriends favorite ice cream book,"I personally am not the biggest fan of ice cream bases where the egg isn't cooked, but sometimes I turn the other cheek because it's good ice cream. This is one of those cases. When my boyfriend gets an idea to make ice cream, this is the cookbook he head for---he is lazy otherwise.I can attest that the chocolate and strawberry are amazing---as is the Cherry Garcia and others.I think of all the ice cream books out there---this is the best for people who have a general interest. It's easy and it always yields great results."
5,awesome!,"This book is great. I just got the Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker and I use this book everytime!The beginning was interesting, B&J; write about their start and how they came to be. I found it inspiring and light-hearted."
2,This books needs updating,"I was really looking forward to this book based on the reputation of Ben and Jerry's Ice Creams. I was VERY disappointed that this book, published in the 1980's, features many recipes that call for whole raw eggs that don't get cooked !! Was there no problem with salmonella back then? I would have expected them to update the book or tell the home cook how to make an acceptable substitution. Better yet, when we buy Ben and Jerry's I can't believe the FDA allows them to sell a product that has uncooked eggs in it. If they have made adjustments they should have let the book buyer in on it."
1,Don't buy this book,"This book is a waste of money. You can get better recipes on the Internet.The recipes for the ice cream bases that call for eggs do not state how to cook it properly, so unless you're a fan of raw egg ice cream, skip this book altogether.It's actually turned me off to their ice cream."
3,Blah,"This book is okay, but the texture is gritty and it improved when I COOKED the custard.........RATHER disappointing, cos the ice cream melted very rapidly, so it was like ""eating"" or should I say ""drinking"" milkshake....nothing like what they sell in the store.....The good thing about it is the number of flavours and variations you can make"
5,wonderful,"This book it great, lots of reciepes and was interesting to read all the facts about Ben & Jerry."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"we got a softserve icecream maker & saw this book, we have tried several & everyone is better than the last. this is a must have if you own your own maker. its much cheaper than the real B&G in the grocery store"
4,Only made 1 so far,I only made one recipe so far (Georgia Peach) It was very good! Can't wait to try the other ones.
5,Great book for ice cream recipes!,"This is a great ice cream and desert recipe book. For beginners and beyond, the recipes are easy and the finished product tastes great! I highly recommend this book. If you only buy one ice cream recipe book, let it be this one! If you buy two books, I also recommend ""The Perfect Scoop: Ice Creams, Sorbets, Granitas, and Sweet Accompaniments,"" which is also a great ice cream recipe book with easy recipes (and there are many, MANY recipes to try in that one)."
4,Good Recipes,"The beek arrived as expected and is filled with many good recipes. The problem is that there are so many, how do you choose which one?"
5,Thanks Ben & Jerry for sharing,"Thanks to recipes on the Internet I've given away dozens of cook books collected over my 56 years of married life. This book, however, is a keeper. We've tried out 3 different recipes so far and they turn out as good as they sound. The White Mountain ice cream maker and this book are a perfect pair. Yummy is the favorite comment of my guests. (mine too) It's difficult to decide which flavor is next. The ingredient list is quite rich with cream, etc. but I say if you're going to eat ice cream it should be the best and these recipes truly are."
5,THIS BOOK IS GREAT,"this book is a must have. it tell you all about ice cream, and ben and jerrys, and has a lot of recipes too. they have many different types of recipes, any thing from eggnog icecream, to kiwi icecream. i have tried a ton of recipes out of this book and they are all really really good. my favorite is the oreo mint."
3,Disappointing,"I bought this book for only one reason -- the Cherry Garcia recipe. I have made it twice. It isn't anything like the real product, not even close (canned cherries and Hershey's chocolate??) I agree it's a cute book and would make a cute companion gift with an ice cream maker, and the recipes are ok, but don't get it because you want to be able to make Ben & Jerry's at home."
3,Interesting stories--ok ice cream recipes,"I tried a few of the recipes but they tasted too sweet and so high caloric that I won't use them again. That being said, it is an interesting book as it tells the Ben & Jerry history and some basics of ice cream making. If you are just looking for recipes, other books offer wider variety and a wider range of ingredients."
4,Very good ice cream recipes,"The ice cream recipes are very good, especially the strawberry ice cream recipe. As for the baking section, I've tried the chocolate chip cookies which were very good! But, I also tried the brownie layer ice cream cake which came out terribly wrong. As someone said earlier, the proportions were all wrong, majorly. We had to end up eating the brownie cake layers by themselves which were very thick and rich. It didn't end up working out as an ice cream cake at all. I was very disappointed! Especially since it was supposed to be a birthday cake."
4,Ben & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream and Dessert Book,"This little ice cream cookbook is a pretty wonderful device to use to make any kind of concoction you could dream of in the way of ice cream that is home made. I have found delightful, fun recipes that are easy, quick, and DELICIOUS! None of the recipes have failed my craving for a unique, delectable ice cream yet!"
3,A good ice-cream cookbook,"This is really good and fantastic, I suggest you buy it, but if you have only got a 1 quart ice-cream maker, don't buy it. This book requires at least 1 and a half quarter or more... but anyway, this is a really good cookbook, I must say."
3,A slight egg problem,"I like the recipes in this book but suggest modifying them if you are concerned about salmonella in raw eggs (worth a thought if you are serving to kids). Most of the recipes do (contrary to another review here) include eggs, but never are the eggs cooked. It's not hard to modify the recipes to cook the eggs -- just make a custard with the eggs, sugar, and cream following the pattern of most other ice cream recipes. But I'm surprised B&J don't even mention this issue."
3,Interesting ice cream book,"This book was a disappointment to me - three basic recipes for ice cream to which you then add different ingredients. They also have some sorbet and drink recipes. Their background was interesting, but I could have read it online. After making a few of their recipes we decided we liked our old standby (which is one of theirs as well): 2 cups milk, 1 can sweetened condensed milk (we use nonfat), then you can add a little more sugar if you like, an egg, almond and/or vanilla extract. Mix and use your ice cream freezer.....easy and delicious with whatever extra goodies you may wish to add! Save your money and buy a little better ice cream maker!"
5,Amazing,"I must admit I was never a Beatles fan, but I am certainly a Paul McCartney fan now. Ecce Cor Meum is fantastic. The melodies soar, the words inspire, and the total work lifts the spirit. Beautiful voices, wonderful music in a perfect setting. I have already watched this twice and am looking forward to my next viewing.A wonderful contribution to any classical contemporary collection. Give it a try. I don't think you'll be unhapy with this music."
1,Freak Focus of South-Africa skews reality,"Ballen proves himself an able photographer, however by focusing on the freaks and degenerates in my own country, he tends to skew reality substantially, and his book serves only to re-inforce often damaging stereotypical views."
3,"Excellent Gift, Visually Stunning Packaging, Sub-Standard Product","I bought this for my midwife as a thank-you gift. The gift box it comes in is absolutely delicious to look at. It looks very expensive. The scent of the product really did smell like lavendar, though, looking at the ingredient list, it doesn't look like a great product."
4,Nice,Bought this for my wife and she enjoys it. The bath salts smell great and the lotion really moisturizes. Great gift set.
5,Excellent gift for young lady,"My 13 yo son was invited to a birthday party for a 13 yo young lady. It's hard for a boy to get a girl a present without it seeming too intimate. At the same time, however, we wanted something that expressed that he was glad to have her as a friend and to have been invited to her party. This was perfect. It wasn't too expensive, it looks very nice, and the little wooden spoon is so cute! We were very happy with the quality. It smelled great. Overall, excellent choice.(Wanted to edit this to say when we purchased it, it was less than $10. It's currently more than $30. At less than $10, it was a great gift. I wouldn't spend more than $10 on it though!)"
2,"Cheaper than it appears in the pictures, poor quality bath products","I hadn't heard of Michel Design Works but I bought this gift set for my mother who takes baths daily and enjoys quality bath products. I found the packaging to be appealing and the salts and lotions appeared to be of good quality. Unfortunately, when I received the product I was disappointed to discover that the packaging seemed cheap. The other day, while searching for a Band-Aid at my parent's house I discovered the products virtually unused, sitting in the closet. My mom had used them a couple of times and apparently not enjoyed them. She burns right through the Bath & Body Works and Archipelago products I get her as gifts so it is obvious that she found these to be unappealing despite lavender being her favorite scent. I will not purchase products from Michel Design Works in the future."
3,disapointing,sent the item as a gift and was told that it was very poor quality for what was paid for it. although i never saw the product. the recipient was not happy.

1,"This is copper cable, but it's not 4ga","Sorry guys, the overall diameter with the insulation is the same as 4ga welding cable from the local shop but strip off the vinyl and this is just 8ga cable inside. Maybe car audio installers don't know the difference but I have been working with heavy current cable for a dozen years and have all of the special *American* made crimps to join them, so this ain't what the label says on the spool."
3,More like 6 gauge,Doesnt look as big but still works fine. Also I drive an 84 Camaro and this thing almost ran out when I ran it to my back. Make sure you have enough.
1,not real 4 gauge,this wire is not true 4 gauge. i would not recomend this for anything other than speaker wire
2,Be Careful...,"This cable is not 4 Gauge as many have stated in previous reviews, I only bought it to see for myself because I really only needed 6-8 AWG cable anyway. Sure enough, this cable was alot smaller than the existing 4 AWG that I have. I can fit 2 of these cables into a 4 gauge ring terminal and crimp them together in 1 terminal. No way you can do that with REAL 4 gauge cable."
1,copper wiring only the size of 8 ga,"Was displeased with this order. the jacket is probably 4ga, but the copper wiring inside was only 8 gauge. I would be cautious when ordering."
2,8awg,outer case is what i would normally expect on 6awg wire...and the strands inside are what i would normally expect from 8awgi purchased this knowing it was not marked correctly (wire fits perfectly in 8awg terminal's) outer case fits perfectly in 4awg terminals so just be aware you are getting what you pay for
1,"Warning, Do Not Buy Me!!","this is pure dung, I can't believe that Luca Turilli was involved with this cd!"
4,A great composer,"Turilli again shows that he is one of todays great composers, of any musical genre. Metalheads may be disappointed that the driving speed metal which was so prominant on his first two solo albums has almost gone. What we have here are compositions and arrangements of a more complex and mature nature. As with all great artists Turilli continues to take musical risks. He must continue to take risks in the future and ignore the whinging 15 year old boys who only want to hear metal. The only disappointment, as with previous works, is for listeners for whom English is their first language the lyrics can be corny. It would be better if he wrote in his native Italian tongue. Highlights for me are Dreamquest, Sospiro Divino, Kyoto's Romance, Too Late, Dolphin's Heart and Gothic Vision.I feel lucky that I live in the same age as Turilli and can look forward to his next work and appreciate his developement as a composer. Taking risks is what great artists do and he must continue doing so."
4,Definitely a departure from the standard fare...,"Last night I was at a Hate Eternal show, and this morning I'm on Amazon writing a raving review about this crap. I almost feel like a hypocrite right now...For me, this truly is Luca's masterpiece. On so many levels, he has proven himself a modern composer with all the sensibilities to infuse classical with contemporary and create something original and intriguing. For a start, he approaches this album as more of a keys man, rather than a fretboard tickler (sorry, no money shots). Also, the fact that there is a female vocalist definitely helps to further set this apart from Luca's previous projects.Metal fans beware: I would not really consider this to be a metal album. There are a lot of opera-style moments, but for the most part, it is a richly layered and complex pop album. If you are open to musical variety, and can enjoy music in a part of your house where your roommates can't listen in, then you should give this a try. It's certainly worth it."
3,It's pretty good...,"The album is indeed intricate and layered and well produced but... something is missing, and I think it is called Tuomas Holopainen."
3,A Few Hits,"Some of the songs really resonate with me, like the track titled Energy, but overall it is only a decent album. I don't regret the purchase because it took me quite awhile to track down an actual cd but I was hoping for more from the selections I'd been exposed to via I Heart Radio and Pandora. Likewise, while there is plenty of English to be found, there is also a lot of Italian and so be ready to enjoy some of the music on its own merit without necessarily understanding the words."
3,Eh,"It works, but it is nearly impossible to use and doesn't come with directions. The ink doesn't come up so don't spill it on anything. Also, the ink always sinks through even the thickest pages, and smears everywhere."
2,Not enough for the exam I took,"Be careful of this exam. You need much more than the PC age product has for this one. I have the whole MCSE testmaster package and have been satisfied to this point. The questions in testmaster are far too easy and do not cover enough for this exam. However, having taken 087 and failed, I can tell you that the transcender BLOWS testmaster away on this one. Check out their free demo on their site if you dont believe me. It makes the Testmaster look like childs play. In closing, I will let you know how PC ages ""refund after failure guarantee"" works out."
4,Excellent prep tool for the IIS4 exam,"Many questions very close to actual exam. A couple of typo's kept me from rating ***** , i.e. question 83 correct answer is ""D"" [according to description & MS Technet] but marks it wrong unless you pick ""B"".You will be wise to also study ""brain dump heaven"". I compiled a list of questions from several dumps, crossreferenced answers where possible.Good luck.J.R. MCSE, MCP+I"
4,101 American English Proverbs,It is an excelent book. English is my second language and this book has helped me to understand how american people talks.Now I'm also using the language that american people use for the daily talks.Thanks.
5,this is a very good book,I think that this book show us how to live right while most people tend to forget the right way to live in our busy society
2,Lousy is exactly what I was thinking,"I saw this guy live and he has to be one of the worst and most boring performers I have ever seen. His singing is horrible and his songs go on and on and never seem to end. This is just what we need. Another self-indulgent wannabe folk troubadour. To compare this to visionaries like Leonard Cohen, Will Oldham or Nick Drake makes my side hurt from laughing so hard. Guys like Simon can get away with playing on a street corner for a buck or two but to give up your hard earned cash for tripe like this is unforgivable. I give this release two stars for the ample production but I will avoid him at all costs in the future. Lousy and boring."
5,Xuxa's finest album to date,"To those who have listened to or bought Xuxa's previous albums in the past will be pleasantly surprised to learn that she has finally matured as a singer.Long gone are the children's anthems such as ""Ilarie"" and the cheap production values of her previous work.""El Mundo es de los dos"" sees Xuxa transformed into a thundering modern queen of the disco following in the footsteps of Spain's dance music sensation Rebeca in uniting powerful irresistable pop songs with a solid state of the art club sound.That is not to say that the whole album is dance orientated;probably the finest moment on the album is the stunningly beautiful ""Mi Niña Bonita"",dedicated to her recently born daughter Sasha.Other highs are ""Besame Poquito"" and the irresistable hooks of""Convencete"" and ""Loca Por Ti"".It looks like Xuxa has finally grown up and may she long continue to produce work of this standard."
5,WORKED FINE,WORKED FINE GOOD SHIPPING AND EASY TO INSTALL BE FAX MACHINE YET IF I NEEDED ANOTHER ONE I WOULD BY THIS ONE
1,HP blew this one!,"Bought brand new, looked good, set up easy.....then, Dial tone button would not pop out, no dial tone. Ringer would not work. I can't believe HP would let this leave the factory with these defects!"
4,Worked great for two years,"I have no complaints at all except maybe durability. It's been a great machine for two years. Now it is starting to wear out--lots of paper jams. I've never had a fax last more than two years, so maybe that's par for the course. Don't know about these reports of lemons. I've had no problems till now."
4,keen and depth,"This book is ingeniously written by a mastermind who piers into the human mind trying to grasp its secrets. BUt as he shows in this book, the mysteries are still there. This professor of psychology is baffled by the wonder of the complexity of the human mind. How can it be made this way? he ponders this and we read his thoughts about it."
5,WOW!,This is one of my favorite products!!! I use this everyday. I love making loose tea and usually its a pain to carry on the go. This mug is extremly solid and I have had it stay warm for over 8 hrs!!
5,Great piece of gear,"I've taken this coffee mug around the world, into Iraq and back and it is durable, reliable and works as advertised keeping coffee hot with no leaks in your backpack or travel bag for hours."
4,Pretty good but time-consuming,The activities in this book at great for getting students excited about their independent or class novels. The projects do take some time to complete. Great to use every once in awhile but not everyday.
1,horrible quality,"this arrived with the on/off switch dangling and the black square rim you see surrounding it on the right with the blue on/off switch loose and falling inside the case. bought 3k even though vacuum is only 2.5k or so and with only about 5 uses (under 15 min each since only 1br apartment) it stopped functioning. the model is not supposed to have a fuse so there isn't a way i know to fix it. if anyone has suggestions, would be keen to hear them. also, the multiple adaptor is flimsy and sometimes would spark when plugged into the outlet. i never felt save with it plugged in after use so that it was always disconnected from the outlet after use. don't waste the money on this brand!"
3,Pretty good book,"This book has a variety of puzzles (word search, crossword, unscramble, etc.), each needing the words for the puzzles to be translated into spanish. There are different categories of words, each category with a limited selection of vocabulary. For me, the book would be better if it consisted more of basic everyday words that you need when first learning spanish. But still, fun if you know a little spanish and like word puzzles or if you just want some variety in studying some new spanish words."
2,Not very easy Vocabulary!,"I have a bachelors degree in Spanish and I found these puzzles to be difficult. Many of the Spanish words that the book wants you to find are not the common names for that word, or are very subject specific words. For example, there is a puzzle about plants and animals were you are supposed to change the English words into Spanish. One word they want you to translate is ""swallow"" which is a very specific type of bird. The Spanish word for this, golondrina, is rarely used in Spanish. This book is good if you know Spanish at an advanced level and want to increase your vocabulary so that you know big words. If you are a beginner who wants to learn basic, common Spanish words this is probably not the book for you!"
1,Not what I was looking for,"I was looking more for crossword puzzles, there are very few of those in here. It's fine if you're looking for other kinds of puzzles."
4,great insight into the movie-star personna,Mr. Nolte has been a fascinating actor to me for many years. I often wondered how they develop their characterizations and Mr. Weiser obviously knows Nolte well enough to not only disclose his innermost techniques of acting but of the actual working of his thought processes. It's a book that is hard to put down. Weiser has an fast paced approach to literature and takes no prisoners. I'd be interested in reading some of his fiction if available.
2,The Great Escape,"Many different types of people could relate to this book in various ways, whether you like photography, science, writing, films or even just reading. If you have gone through something difficult in your life and you felt that there was nothing left, this book might be able to provide you with the light you need in order to remember that anything is possible. Not only did Kati Marton do an amazing job with this book but she also did a great job in speaking out to her audience. The Great Escape is great for people who have faced a difficult moment in their lives."
3,Hungarians love their salami and their Magyars,Every anti-semitic Hungarian needs to read this book.
2,"Great idea, Unclear writing style","Wonderful to read about the contributions of Hungary and these Hungarian Jews, in particular. However, I stopped reading the book after the second chapter. The author starts discussing a topic, and then digresses, and then digresses on the digression; the original topic gets lost this way. I found it very frustrating to want to know more and more about what the book has to offer, but finding the book written in an annoying and unclear style. Was there an editor???"
4,A Great Read,"Few lives are more inspiring than the lives of the nine men who fled anti-Semitic Hungary to make some of the most ground-breaking contributions to science, theater, photography and literature in history. Marton has compiled a compelling biography that reads like an action adventure, following each of one these brave, brilliant men as they overcome overwhelming obstacles, soar to the top of their game and rub elbows with the elite. Although dizzying at times, the novel is impressively researched and ingeniously woven together, intersecting the lives of these unforgettable men who shared a wealth of ambition, charisma, genius, and a desperate desire for peace."
3,"OK, but...","I found this book quite interesting although not very well written. I am also less than happy with some of choices made by the author - why these nine are featured when some of them (A. Korda, for example) are not in the same league of significance as others. Why were others ignored?But that was all well until I read that E. Wigner never returned to Hungary late in his life and was never honored there officially. I met Wigner in Budapest in the late seventies on one of his several trips to Hungary and I know that he received numerous acknowledgments there. Among others, he was elected an Honorary Member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. So I wonder, what else is inaccurate in the book?"
5,The Great Escape: Nine Jews Who Fled Hitler and Changed the World,an exceptional history in a book that you can't put down.
5,Lovely and touching.,"Physicists, filmmakers and photographers -- a lovely group biography of the people who brought us Casablanca, Doris Day, and the bomb. Fascinating insight into some of the most famous names of the mid-20th century, and the context in which they grew up. Makes me want to visit Central Europe, look at old photos, and read more about them."
4,Historical Budapest,"This fascinating book gives us a brilliantly presented tapestry of events that influenced Budapest and its citizens. However, she omitted one vital fact, that Hungary's Jews were invited about 500 years ago by the great king Matyas to boost his anemic commerce. Our family Bible that chronicles this fact is probably still archived in Bakony where my grand parents owned a winery. This one fact is greatly responsible for Jewish families rapid assimilation."
5,Get to know the real Jose Carreras,"A perfect opportunity for those who only know Carreras as thethird tenor, to understand why this great artist took the operaworld by storm in the early 70's. His beautiful lyric voice andpassionate delivery are exemplified in the arias of Verdi, Puccini, Donizetti, Bizet et al., in addition to popular classicsand more modern works. An excellant compilation of thisexceptional artist!!"
5,I have used this CD for TEN YEARS...,"As a massage therapist, this is the ONLY CD I have used consistently in my practice over the past TEN years. There is something about this particular CD that I absolutely love and that has not been duplicated in other CDs I have used (literally hundreds!) Steven Halpern comes up with awesome music! I have many of his other CDs as well, but NOTHING comes close to ""Gifts of the Angels"". I am now using my 3rd copy and will buy another when this one is worn out. Many of my clients ASK me to use it in their massage sessions and ask me where to find Halpern's music. Superb."
4,Music for yoga classes,This music is very relaxing and appropriate for background music for yoga classes. I use it also for the relaxation part of my classes. I have also used this CD for personal meditation.
2,Less than expected,"I guess the customer reviews got my expectations up too high. I think the music sounds too computerized. Hardly ""Angelic"" in my opinion."
4,Learned some great tips,"I purchased this video for two reasons; I wanted to discover some new tricks for XP's operating system and I wanted to review the quality of Keystone's product line before I invest more money in their A+ video. I did learn some get tips and those tips have helped me become more efficient at navigating throughout the OS, saving me time in my workday. The quality of Keystone's video was good. It did take a couple of minutes to get use to their interface; but once I did, I found that the lessons were well organized. The Instructor in the video is truly an expert in this field. I will buy Keystone products again in the future for my training needs."
1,Simply bad,"After no more than 10 to 15 recharging cycles the battery doesn't work anymore. A camera advice appears saying ""change battery pack"" and then turns off."
5,:),"Trip down memory lane for our family! Can't wait to get the other seasons, so we'll have the whole collection."
5,Love it,"These bring back so many memories from when I was a kid. Very cool, absolutely love it. Great addition to my collection."
3,The Brady Bunch First Season,"I love seeing the old uncut shows but the quality is not the best, probably the way the series was filmed."
3,Entertaining despite its obvious flaws.....,"The Brady's biggest success was showing a blended family with wit and humor. The flaws - a supposedly middle-class family has a maid, and what did Carol Brady do all day? She didn't work and had a maid - and the too-cute kids who formed a family unit a bit too easily for stepbrothers and stepsisters - weren't noticeable then and can be ignored now. The jokes are great....relive the pranks and puns and the incredibly bad fashions of the 70s. We grew up with the Bradys and they grew on us."
3,Nice Family Show...,"...but I always preferred ""The Partridge Family"".Many of those who loved the ""Flipper"" and ""Gentle Ben"" TV series in their childhood also liked ""Kentucky Jones"" (Dennis Weaver) and ""The Farmer's Daughter"" (Inger Stevens) and later on ""The Partridge Family"" in the early seventies.I wish these wonderful old TV series and many others like ""Yancy Derringer"", ""A Man called Shenandoah"" (Robert Horton), ""The Detectives"" (Robert Taylor), ""Hank"" (Dick Kallman), ""He and She"" (Paula Prentiss), ""The Magic Boomerang"", ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (Jack Palance), ""Adventures of the Seaspray"" would finally be released on DVD.The Baby Boomers would be more than happy about it!!!"
3,"Fuzzy, gainy ""restored"" picture","The colors look fine, not as bright as I remembered, but I was surprised at how SOFT and GRAINY the picture looks. I thought these were newly restored! I guess I was expecting it to look like the BRADY BUNCH MOVIE, and remembered it that way.Paramount's laserdisc release of Mission Impossible from that same period looks much sharper & fresher (I was involved in the restoration requests for that series in 1988).I am told that the later seasons look better."
4,Brady bunch DVD,"With all the garbage on tv and in the movies lately, it's so refreshing to have my whole family enjoy the Brady's like I did growing up. You never have to worry about bad language or inappropriate topics. Sit back and enjoy"
4,delightful!!,"I got this for my daughter hoping she would like it as much as i did when i was a kid,, she watched it everynight until she got to the end.. one episode was a little blurred but that was it.. great !!"
3,Discovering the Brady bunch,"Being french , this series has never been on french Tv, I am glad to discover it on DVDIt' s fun, very fresh, no violence no sex for a change, very much like the 60' s seriesThe material is good, the image seems to have been restored, remastered!Very good moments with this family made for the small screen, even 38 years later."
3,Fair to Good,"- Most songs have little to no connection with the actual- For the People and It's Over totally stink+/- Most Songs Are fair to ok, other than the two mentioned above there are no tracks to really hate+ A slightly differed version of ""One Card Short"" and a remix of the ""Yu-Gi-Oh! Theme""+ You're Not Me, Blind Ambition, and Step Up are good songsOverall, the CD is wotrth about $5 - $7. I recommend for Major Yu-Gi-oh Fans but if you you're looking to live up to the expectations of the first CD, you're in for a disappointment, though ""One Card Short"" deffinetly makes the CD worth buying."
4,Awesome CD!!,"First, I'm 14, and I play Yu-gi-oh! and Watch the TV show. I say this so everyone knows that this isn't just for little kids (especially not the manga). That aside, I loved this CD!! The only 2 black marks are ""For the People"" and ""It's Over"". Once those songs are past, the entire CD rules! My favorites are 1,3,4,5,8,11. So, in conclusion, I highly recommend this CD. The only reason this didn't get 5 stars was because of the 2 bad songs. After them, it's just about perfect!!"
2,Not as good as Sherlock,"The first 100 pages of this picaresque are hilarious, then it begins to run out of steam. The running joke, that the protagonist is too incompatent to carry off any assasination, is not funny enough to carry an entire book. After Dimitri bungled his second assasination attempt I became bored sensing that there were no more surprises in store, and there weren't. Some of the historical references are interesting and others are flat. People who have never seen Zelig or Forrest Gump might find this story original, but it isn't. There is a theory among Brazilian television comedians like Jo Soares that there are only a limited number of jokes in the world and that they can be repeated over and over again with slight variations and people will still laugh. 12 Fingers suggests otherwise."
5,Much Improved Fifth Edition.,"Any book of thys type that has gone through five editions has to have something going for it, and This book has many. Perhaps the most important is the writing style which is as light and casual as it can be considering the subject. The goal is, of course, to prepare the student for a career. The book combined instructional material with case histories that illustrate how a particular case, situation, or patient was successfully handled. Each chapter starts with a page entitles 'A Nurse Speaks.' Here practicing nurses relate some of their historyIn addition to the text, the book is supplied with a CD-ROM oriented to preparation for the NCLEX examination. A companion web site for the book provides yet more information to help the student.This is one of the standard books in the field, and it's easy to see why. This book convey's the information the student needs to know in a style that makes it as easy as possible."
3,Psychiatric mental health Nursing,i liked the book and it came in time for me to use as i had intended. I was happy.
5,Good and easy to understand.,"Other than the Chapter materials, there are many additional useful information including an online resource, tables, examples and images to facilitate learning."
1,Not received yet,"I've not received it and its taking long time than expected.Since I've not received it, I can't say whether its good or not."
1,Euro-Pro Shark GI475,"Bought this iron at Target a couple of days ago and plan on returning it. The first time I used it, it kept shutting off even when it was left unattended only a few minutes, not 7. The second time I used it, it would not heat up enough to be able to produce steam. I doubt I will try another of this brand. Previously I had a T-Fal iron that worked well for about 10 years."
1,Auto Shut Off does not work,"The iron automatically shut off four times while I was ironing one shirt. The instructions say that the iron shuts off after seven minutes but it's more like every thirty seconds (very annoying!). The iron does not produce much steam. Also, the headlight is very difficult to turn off an off and on."
1,frustrating,"This iron is very frustrating. It's unclear how many of the gadgets on it work. It shuts of automatically when you don't want it too, the headlight I still haven't figured out, and the temperature settings dial is confusing as well. I just purchased this iron and will be returning it. My cheap black and decker iron is going to have to come back out of the closet."
1,Sorely disappointed,"I have owned an earlier Typing Instructor Deluxe and was happy with it. However, the new CD of Typing Instructor Deluxe 17 is unusable because the sentences in the lessons are overwritten and illegible.Typing Instructor Deluxe 17"
1,Poor,Having used Mavis Beacon 8 long ago I wanted a refresher... This program is really not well designed--the biggest problem is each exercise only features a line or two of the appropriate new symbols/keys and then you are typing all the letters you know--sometimes even ones you haven't been taught yet--so it's difficult to solidify the finger positioning of new keys and gets confusing. Really not well thought out. There are enough advanced features that an experienced typist can increase their speed or a child COULD learn on it... but MB is so much better. Someone claiming to go from 20 to 54 wpm in a week is either an experienced typist that was rusty or lying (then 103 wpm. Sure).
5,Good teaching,I would recommend this to everyone that wants to learn how to type or increase their speed in typing. I just love it.
4,Typing Instructor Delux,Great typing tutor. My kids like it. It's easy and quick to learn and very interesting for anyone who's just starting out on the typing experience. I highly recommend it...
1,disappointed,"Product description states uses Windows 7 platform, but box states Windows Vista only. Returned item for refund. Check out Typing Instructor Platinum Version 21. This uses Windows 7 platform but you won't find it here. Search for it on the web and you can find it for $16."
3,Expected More,"I was looking to improve my typing for my job and decided with the good reviews this product had received it would be more helpful. Probably works better for kids than adults wish I had gotten Typing Master Pro, I downloaded the demo it seems like it would help me more."
2,I guess it's a good product...didn't help me though,"I'm a fairly good typer already, I just have difficulty in a few areas for things like the symbols on top of the numbers. The only ones I ever have to use are ! and $ but I don't know where the others are. So I bought this product to help me but the software would tell me I was doing great when really I was messing up big time. It allows you to erase your mistakes so it will say I did 100% everytime when in reality I had to backspace almost every letter and retry again. I don't think I learned anything."
1,Terrible Book - dated and biased,"One star is the only rating because there isn't a zero! ALso, there's no truth in advestising - it was written in 1965 (even though this ""edition"" was published in 2007) and although the product information says it is 48 pages, its really only 32 pages with the rest blank. The quality is terrible, it looks like a photocopy of a memeograph!The title itself is quite misleading. This is not investigative reporting, there is no semblance of research and no attempt to learn anything about nudism first hand. It's really a polemic, almost a long sermon, that expresses the author's belief's without anything that could be called supporting evidence. One has to wonder about the commercial motivations of publishing something over 40 years old. Save you money and time."
1,Overpriced reprint,"""Facts about Nudism"" was actually first published by Paddell Book Company (New York City) in 1939 as a booklet, sometimes (I believe) to be given away at nudist exploitation films. More and more pseudo-publishers are churning out such older, post-copyright material hoping to make some money. The original 32-page booklet can be found at various online used book sources. Don't buy this to learn about the history of nudism; buy it if you want to know what critics or the general public thought about this social trend arising in the U.S. in the very early 1930s."
2,Yikes!!,This book contains some decent and useful information but is written in such an overly-romantic style and from such an incredibly biased position as to make it almost unreadable. Stay away! Try to find something with a little better perspective.
1,Don't waste your hour and a half,"The timelines and bibliography are good. Otherwise, I would say this book reminds me of an offhand attempt to dispose of a topic the author has little interest in or sympathy for. Just to make the series complete. Shallow. If you want to read a much better Kierkegaard intro, try Donald D. Palmer's Kierkegaard for Beginners. It takes a little longer than 90 minutes, but it's written with gusto."
3,did not remove macrovision,Product was received in good shape and easy to set up. However it did not remove Macrovision copy protection. I was only able to back up 50% of the VHS tapes I owned onto DVD
1,Didn't help me,I was trying to make copies of the video tapes I already own on to DVD's so my kids could watch them in the car on a portable DVD player. I have a Panasonic E30 DVD recorder. This box didn't help record anything on the E30.
4,Unbelievable bravery in helo operations in Vietnam in early part of war,Fantastic story of the journey travelled by chopper pilots from training to operations in a highly dangerous war zone.mason takes us through a no holds barred roller coaster ride of his early days in the initial deployment of air cav. Here is another story of a warrior who saw and dealt with terrible battle scenes and danger. It is a fantastic story and one feels great empathy for Mason and his comrades.This is an iconic Vietnam story. Highly recommended.
4,HONEY GONE NUTS,"Amazon:I bought this product for my wife, and she likes it very much, but now that I see how fast she eats this cereal, I'm afraid I will have to STOP our AUTOMATIC SHIPMENT of this product! It's just TOO EXPENSIVE to keep ordering!I wish Breadshops would offer this product in a LARGE BAG (2 lbs) and make it LESS EXPENSIVE to buy!Thanks for your support!Larry & Carol James"
1,Flimsy,This item was very fragile and broke before I even had a chance to see if it was useful. Not worth the time or effort to return it though.
1,sally,User unfriendly. Don't know if mine was broken. It didn't keep the calories in memory so when I added more calories later on the first calculation was gone. A big BIG waste of money .Bought Nutrition assistant . It seems pretty nice around the same price. Take a look www. nutritionassistant.com I haven't really gotten into it but what I saw I liked. Wished that I would have seen this one before I spent my money on that other thing.
3,Water In My Head saves it,"Hey, I'm biased... Water In My Head is my favorite ska song of all time. Otherwise I'd give this CD 1 or 2 stars. I can (and have) put that song on repeat, on headphones, for 2 hours straight and come out loving it just as much. It takes a few listens to hear all the different melodies and how well they work together. I especially like the bass line. Anyway, the rest of the songs are OK, not really horrible, but not particularly worth listening to. If you want several good songs, Libido blows this CD away."
1,If you didn't hate Ska already...you will now.,"This album is one big train wreck. I really can't write a long review about it because there isn't much to say. The songs are watered down ska at its worst. It feels like they are just trying to throw something together to get money, not to make good songs. I didn't mind ska before, but this band is why ska gets such a bad rap. Stay away from this album. Save your money and buy something else....anything else...you will get more mileage out of a Yanni album."
3,What I Think About This Product Is...,...that it REALLY needs the song titles and performing bands/artists listed on its Amazon.com page. So to put my money where my mouth is...SIDE A:A1 Gorky Park - My Generation (4:43)A2 Skid Row - Holidays In The Sun (3:34)A3 Scorpions - I Can't Explain (3:20)A4 Ozzy Osbourne - Purple Haze (4:21)A5 Mötley Crüe - Teaser (5:18)SIDE B:B1 Bon Jovi - The Boys Are Back In Town (4:01)B2 Cinderella (3) - Move Over (3:24)B3 Drum Madness - Moby Dick (5:53)B4 Bon Jovi / Cinderella (3) / Klaus Meine - Hound Dog (3:19)B5 Scorpions / Gorky Park / David Bryan - Blue Suede Shoes / Long Tall Sally (2:54)B6 Skid Row / Mötley Crüe / Zakk Wylde / Jason Bonham - Rock And Roll (4:58)P.S. - Don't put your money where your mouth is. It tastes bloody 'orrible!!!
5,Three is just as good...,"I got turned onto Kosheen years ago through an internet radio station that played ""Catch"" from Kosheen's first album ""Resist."" With the song stuck in my head, and an import CD later, I placed them in the tops of my favorite groups. With their second album, I figured they couldn't do it twice. I was happily, wrong.Can Kosheen be as good the third time? Yep. As awe-inspiring as ever.Kosheen is a hard group to explain. Are they Rock? Techno? Dance? Pop? All of the above wrapped in a perfect blanket of balance and singing glee? One song may be a ""meme-pop,"" then next a smooth lyrical flow folowed by a bit of hard rocking fun. But, every song is something to groove to - something that makes you move.Anyone that likes their previous albums, you won't be disapointed. Much like me, you'll be singing ""Guilty"" at the top of your lungs in no time. For those that have never heard of Kosheen? Give them a try. You might surprise yourself and find a wonderful gem."
2,Not good in my opinion,As a fan of left Over Salmon I will say that I was disapointed with this album very poor actually
5,One of the year's 10 best Cds. A must-have!,"Leftover Salmon played second stage back in the, what, '96 or '97 HORDE tour and I remember being one of about 10 people checking them out at the Las Cruces, NM, show. They blew me away they and they continue to do so. I'm having one of those periods in life where everything is going wrong and life just is lousy. I put on this CD today and the 9-minute tune, Troubled Times, just jumped out of the speakers and spoke to me. It made a really, really bad day bearable. There's a great cover of the classic traditonal Nobody's Fault But Mine and Waylon sits in on Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way. Lots of Nashville folk join in, but beneath it all, Salmon carries the CD to new heights. I've listed to this over and over and, like Euphoria, it just gets better with time. Get it. It's great!"
4,a nice cheap hit,"inexpensive and well worht the money you pay for it. in a world where everything sounds like something else, its hard to come up with something new. now they may sound like someone else, but the lyrics stand out. plus some of the riffs and lines, it just separates them. ""perfect self"" is the best track. a damn good song with loads of potential.peace"
2,They have one good song.,"I honestly thought this CD [wasn't any good]. The only song I remotely liked was ""pain."" I'm disappointed...that I wasted my money on it."
2,a changed opinion,"I once thought this band was good but when I think about it, how are they different from anyone else? The answer is, they're not. The only thing granting this two stars is the fact that some of the guitar riffs are complex in a way. Well, not complex, just not the whole open string then first fret line that has been repeated sooo many times. But, the vocals are soundalike to anyone else you've ever heard and his scream is horrible. And when he sings, most of the time he is whining. The title track shows his vocal abilities to their best and is the only song I would still listen to."
5,This band has got it all,"This is one of the new bands out there that really grab my ears. The song ""old man"" is the best one on here, but they all rock. If you like godsmack, sevendust, and primmer 55 get this album. I put this in my cd player and just press play. There is no need to skip any songs. The music is great, and the singer adds a nice touch. He can sing both soft and get dirty when he needs to. Bottom line, this album is well worth the money."
5,STEREOMUD ROCKS!!!,"I JUST GOT THE STEREOMUD CD, ""PERFECT SELF"", AND I AM AMAZED HOW GOOD THEY ARE. THE SONGS JUST TOOK ME INTO A DIFFERENT WORLD. THEY ARE TOTALLY AWESOME, AND IF YOU HAVENT ALREADY BOUGHT IT, YOU HAVE TO. IF YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO A REALLY EXCELLENT ALBUM, YOU'LL BUY IT."
4,pick this one up,"I admit at first i was a little put off by this CD. It's a little nu-metalish for my style but at the same time it's unique and not trendy in any sense where as most the nu-metal bands such as Drowning Pool or Papa Roach have just followed the bandwagon. I bought this because i'm a long time Life of Agony fan and Joey Z.(guitar) and Dan Richardson(drums) were part of Life of Agony. Although this is in no way even comparable to Life of Agony's stuff it's a really good album and the more i listen to it, the more i like it. If you like the guitar work on this album, check out Joey's old band LIFE OF AGONY. They were truly the godfathers of metal."
4,Stereomud rocks nuff said,"Ok first of I got this c.d. pretty cheap so that's already something good about it. I had already heard the single on the radio and I thought it was realy good. So I bought this c.d. it's not too soft,and it's not realy hard ether it's just normal rock. But it's good the songs are well written,the singer has a realy good voice. The band members themselve's are realy good with their insturments. It's just a realy good c.d. it could do without those untitled tracks. But they don't realy hurt it. So if you like just straight forward rock without rap,d.j.s,and screaming check out Stereomud."
3,Good band... Songs Amazing,"This is a great cd to chill to and jam to. Heavy songs and deep emotional songs. I like the songs, but the little bits of instrumentals kinda was like WTF, but I figured it was just something diff they threw in there... but I liked most of the songs... Good but not Awesome..."
5,very VERY underrated,"This is probably the most underrated band on the metal scene. Stereomud has great heavy tracks and is very talented but unfortunetaly didnt get much publicity. I actually heard 'Dont Be Afraid' on shaun palmers pro snowboarder (which i got for 6 bux!) and i knew i had to get the cd. Get me out, lost your faith, and leave (back up) are great songs but i think that dont be afraid is the best. Stereomud is totally underrated and i think anyone who likes metal should get this cd."
4,This Book Is Older Than 1949,"Some years ago when I was a student at The Ohio State University (circa 1975) I ran across in the library stacks a book by this title that was published in 1918, if I remember correctly. I believe I do because elsewhere on the internet it is attributed to that date. {[...]} I was struck in later years by the reference in it of the universe's contraction and expansion, a la ""big bang"", well before that theory was published, and that we were in iteration number 4 out of 7. Therefore I think that Mr. Scaro is incorrect in his estimate of it being a circa 1949 book. I think that this book is a very useful insight into the perspective of Rosicrucians in the early 20th century."
1,Don't buy this particular version.,"There are several problems in this version of this work. First, there are NO illustrations of the drawings frequently mentioned in the text. But this is not the worst of it. There are typographical errors on nearly every page, rendering the book from an annoyance to virtually unreadable. Try to find an original 1918 edition from Yogi Publication Society by ""Magus Incognito"" (who we now know was William Walker Anderson) and you will probably get far more out of it."
2,Pretty to look at...,"This kettle is rather small, doesn't pour very well and the handle usually gets too hot to grab bare-handed off the stove-top once the water is boiling. About the only thing going for it, is that it matches the Friendly Village dishes and looks nice on the stove."
5,A book every Christian should own,"I cannot rave enough about this book. This is definitely a book every Christian should own, and keep beside his Bible and refer back to it often. I have purchased 7 of these books for family and friends. I am presently reading it for the second time. It is an easy read, but with mega insights. It is for the new Christian as well as the long-time Christian. Truly, a Must Read!"
5,great read,great read for everyone.....Adrian Rogers relays the truths of the Bible in a way that anyone can understand. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to increase their biblical knowledge.
5,Understanding the Basics,Adrian Rogers covers in What Every Christian Ought to Know the basicsof what every new and growing believer ought to know. It is a wonderfulresourse for pastors and Sunday School teachers who want to teach a NewMembers Class for persons who have recently accepted Christ.
2,black is brown is tan,"Was not what I was expecting!Not a story book, more like a bad poem. hard for younger kids to follow & enjoy."
1,Archaic,"This book is well meaning and may have conveyed a positive message at the time it was written. Nevertheless, it tends to reduce people to their skin colors, calling the grandmas ""Grandma White"" and ""Grandma Black"" etc.I think multicultural families are more commonplace and normal than this book seems to imply -this book stressing difference rather than commonality. Good for the archives & the pictures are great, but I'm not reading it to my daughter"
5,Warm and wonderful,We've enjoyed reading this book over and over again. Its a wonderful story with a poetic flow that tells of a family lifestyle that is remarkable and memorable. This will be a great addition to your family library.
3,Great for the Mixed Race Family,"We liked this book mostly for the illustrations. The pictures are an accurate representation of our family and daily lives. The text on the other hand, leaves a lot to be desired. My children fall within the target population (4-8 years) and are learning to read. Text such as ""is girl is boy is nose is face ia all the colors of the race"" does not improve reading and comprehension. For a satisfying book, both in storyline and illustration, ""Black, White, Just Right"" is a better read."
3,Proof Read your book,"I like this book. Its compact yet informative. For some reason it also has a lot of target Pistols. Maybe they were looking for fillers. Thats ok. Its informative. The greatest Error is on page 206 - 207 about the AR-18. You don't have to be a gun nut to figure out the AR-18 is not a 12 gauge, etc. Good book, Good photos, Good descriptions. Just proof read."
4,Gringos In Paradise:An American Couple Builds their Retirement Dream House in Mexico,"I really enjoyed reading this memoir a lot. It has good descriptions, honesty, and humor. It's written in such a friendly, personal way that I would love to go meet the authors! More photos would garner that last star!Dee BratcherArlington, TX"
4,Good Info,"This book is a fun and informative read. There is good descriptive information about what an expat could expect to go through in order to build a new home in a little bit of paradise. The particulars are interspersed with interesting anecdotes and characters. The writer does not sugar coat his story. If you are thinking about building and ""retiring"" in another country, you would find this book helpful as well as entertaining."
3,Info story,"This book is interesting for the story alone, but it also weaves needed information into the story. Anyone thihnking of building a home in Mexico should read this book."
4,Gringos in Paradise,"If you are thinking about retiring south of the border, you should read this book -- a very humorous and informative take on living as an expatriot among the locals."
4,Thinking of moving to Mexico? This is your book!,"This book gives a real feel for gringos living in coastal Mexico. I have been to Sayulita and found the description of the area, the people, the culture ""right on"". A must read for anyone considering a move south - or even just a visit. The author acptures the interesting and unique quirks of the area as well as adapting to a different lefie."
4,A happy moving-and-starting-over story,"Ah! A happy moving and starting over story.Too often these stories end with the movees moving home and starting over again. The Golsons try retirement in Mexico and end up with many new friends, a palatial home, and a relaxed new life in a small Mexican village. Even the home building went smoothly.Astonishing."
5,a boomer anthem,"If you know anything about our generation, you will appreciate Barry Golson's honesty in dealing with facts many of us will face: changed career prospects after 50, inadequate retirement savings, change in spousal relationship after the kids move out, desire for a different way of life. The book moves along at an engrossing pace. I wish he had been a little more explicit about the finances, but I'm a numbers gal, basically I had no complaints. A must-read."
2,Gringos in Paradise: An American Couple Builds Their Retirement Dream House in a Seaside Village in Mexico,"This book reads more like an adventure trip of Ricky Recardo and Lucy. Don't get me wrong, there's certainly some good information, and it's entertaining, but I wasn't quite expecting a day-to-day travel log. My research into Mexico is more focused on differences in areas, prices,costs of living, american enclaves, housing, land, cultural aspects, climate, etc. But, there's been a lot of effort put into this and it does provide one couples experience, which does provide value when evaluating such an experiance."
5,The Only Thing Missing Are The Illustrations and Hitchcock!,"I discovered The Three Investigators series in 1971. The Secret of Terror Castle was the first in the series and the first selection from the collection I read. To my third grade mind, Jupiter Jones was as brilliant as Holmes, but more attainable, to 20th century americana. One great regret from my childhood was getting rid of my Three Investigators collection! What was I thinking? The reprinted editions are missing the fantastic illustrations by Harry Kane, Ed Vebell and company, as well as the delightful prefaces by A. Hitchcock. This is a painful omission in a weak attempt to repackage these fabulous children's mysteries."
5,This is one of my favorite books.,"My mom gave me three of the Three Investigators books for Easter.I thought they would be like any other childrens books.But I got a big surprise! I loved them, they are the best books ever!"
5,This is an outstanding series!,"The Three Investigators series of books is outstanding. I am 28 yrs old and I still read one occasionally. I got these books as a small child and they helped me with reading and comprehension, they also provided a clear goal for what I wanted to do in life (I now own the third largest private investigation corporation in the US). Get these books for your children, you won't regret it."
5,Alfred Hitchcock and the 3 Investigators - Terror Castle,I received the item way before I expected and it was exactly what I ordered.Would gladly purchase from this seller again.Thanks
2,Condition not as expected,"This book was worse off than I was led to believe. Binding was really bad, had to be taped."
4,Secret of terror castle,Book arrived quicker than expected. Recently discovered this Lost series from the sixties. Similar to Hardy Boys. An enjoyable read.
3,Not exactly as pictured,There's no hook on the handle. The reel I rec'd was damaged due to really poor packaging. I had to loosen the bolts holding the two halves of the reel assembly to realign the plastic where it was separated before I could use it. The nut used to fasten the metal shield to the plastic handle was missing. It will do as there are few alternatives.
1,not as advertised,your web site listed the item as suitable for the Epson 1400 printer. It was not. I have returned the product
1,Not the right ink to go with the printer I purchased,"I purchased an Epson Stylus 1400 phot printer, and this ink was featured on the same page to ""buy together"". However, this is not the correct ink for the printer and should not have been featured to buy together. It's most likely good ink, it's just not compatible with the Epson Stylus 1400."
4,Epson X595 inks,"Price is right. Great inks. Caution...some prints need to ""dry out"" since they feel sticky."
5,Edson ink cartridges,"I received these very quickly, three days I think. They were brand new as advertised, and well packed. Completely satisfied."
3,Epson Claria Multi Pack cartridges T078920,"Cartridges never arrived, we were three days calling and did not get an answer until the last day from custumer's service dispacher . Finally charges were refunded and we had to buy the product more expensive."
2,BUY REMANUFACTURED INK,"Obviously this ink worked fantastic, but I'm so mad I didn't buy remanufactured ink until I'd already wasted hundreds on ink directly from EPSON. Trust me, I was a skeptic at first and knew the remanufactured cartridges wouldn't work but I've been using them for months and they print with IDENTICAL quality to EPSON cartridges"
5,perfect transaction,My printer requires genuine Epson ink which is unavailable in my area. I greatly appreciate Amazon's pricing and very fast shipping.
1,It is not recognized by my Epson Stylus Photo RX595,It is not recognized by my Epson Stylus Photo RX595The package looks different than the normal one. It maybe counterfeit.
1,Hmmm.,"No box, Epson or otherwise. Shipped in a flimsy plastic wrapping unlike any Epson cartridge I have now or have ever had. Have not used them, yet. Product definitely not as pictured."
1,Buyer Beware,"This cartridge was either defective or a counterfit. I suspect counterfit as packaging and lable while it said epson, was different from actual epson parts. The printer would not recognize it at all. Took it out and replaced it with a known ""Epson Genuine Cartridge"" and printer works fine. Amazon, to thier credit, accepted the return and gave a refund."
1,Ink didn't work for my Epson stylus photo R280,"I have an Epson stylus photo R280, Epson 78 is the designated ink replacement. I ordered this package, replaced 2 color inks from this purchase. But there is no color coming out of that. I am very dissappointed about the whole purchase. Now, the ink package is open, can't return it, can't print anything neither. I am just wasting the money on sth that doesn't work."
1,Waste of money,"These cartridges, though OEM, are a waste of money. As one of the other reviewers noted, the ones I got are made in Indonesia. My printer would not recognize the cartridges and I had problem after problem with my printer--until I went to Best Buy and purchased a new set of cartridges, made in Mexico as were my original ones, and all of my printer problems went away.I am returning the ones I did not open."
1,doubtful it is a new Epson cartridge,"I read a lot of reviews and a lot of them said only buy your ink from Epson. I couldn't resist the price and bought off Amazon. This black cartridge took about 20 minutes of convincing, reinstalling, head cleaning, repeat, etc before it would print black. I also bought a 5-pack of colors because the package looked authentic. Duh. They weren't in a package when they arrived. They were made in Mexico. They may be former Epson cartridges that have been refilled. I haven't tried them yet. As a consolation prize, they sent me a black cartridge along with my 5 colors. ?? Lesson learned. After this, I will *only buy ink for Epson printers from Epson*."
2,Partial success,"Black ink cartridges worked fine in my Epson Stylus Photo RX680, but the first color cartridge I had to replace (the Light Cyan) would not work. Neither of the 2 that I purchased was accepted by the printer. I will amend this review if I have any further problems. As it is, I had to purchase a Light Cyan cartridge to even complete the print task I was currently performing.Disappointing, to say the least. I have been happy with all of the things I have purchased from Amazon ... up to now."
5,OEM cartridge that works in Epson Photo R260 printer,"My Epson R260 printer has consistently failed to work with aftermarket ink cartridges. It worked fine, however, with this OEM Epson replacement. Assuming it was offered at a good price, I would buy from this vendor again."
3,Epson Color cartridges,I have purchased this item 2 different times from Amazon and 2 of the 5 cartridges have been bad and do not work. Not very happy with the quality of these from Amazon. When buying these cartridges from a store I have not had any of the cartridges been bad.
3,Did not come in shown package!,"I have to agree with other reviewers. This ink was not shipped in original manufacturer's packaging, but just plastic wrapped per set of 3. There was a note packed with it, apologizing for the wrong packaging but they gave a free black cartridge. Even though it works on my printer, I am still trying to figure out whether I have real Epson ink or a refill or whatever it may be. It also took me a lot of head cleanings for the ink to start working and now I only have 3/4th left in my cartridges. I'm not sure if I will be ordering from the same company again. If you want generic ink, you can go way cheaper than this. But if it is real, then it's a good deal I guess.But I just wonder isn't it illegal to sell something but show a entire different package on the photos??"
1,little ink inside,had to wait a month to use the product but when i did they ran out of ink in a very short time. must be old stock and dried out. disappointed
1,Wrong Item Sent,"I ordered the black cartridge but they sent the light cyan. The packaging is confusing and it looks like the black cartridge on the package, but its the blue one. The side panel is black with a small blue dot. The manufacturer should change the packaging."
1,BEWARE! JUNK CARTRIDGES!!!,"Put them in the printer. Printer said all cartridges were half full. Printed 4 pages in BLACK and WHITE. Now COLOR is empty or close to empty (did not print color). Meanwhile the Black cartridge from Best Buy (installed at the same time)is still full(as it should be). These are junk cartridges and are defective. Thought I was buying an Epson product from Epson. Should have read the reviews. JUNK. BEWARE!!! Amazon, please remove this seller!!!"
1,Poor Quality Imitation (Despite the picture),"This product is NOT an EPSON cartridge. It is a poorly designed cheap substitution that does not work in all of the stated Epson printers. My Epson does not even recognize the cartridge once inserted. If you look at the fine print, you see that this is not being sold as an Epson manufactured cartridge, but the seller has done a slick job of hiding that fact......My recommendation - DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT....."
1,These cartridges suck.,"Claim to be original Epson cartridges. With the price, I should have known they are not. And they suck. Sent one back and seller replaced it, but since then the seller hasn't even contacted me back about the other 4 that don't work. Hopefully Amazon.com will eliminate this seller."
3,Cheapier shipping direct from Epson,I hate the fact that Epson can make a product that you have to use there ink in it and they control prices - should be a law keeping companies from doing this ( this just finished a big class action suit & I'm hoping another Attorney does another class action for them doing this to the firmware in the R260 machine locks up with so called compatible ink !
2,BEWARE -- you may not get this exact item...,"Item received was NOT as described. Item Model number denotes RETAIL product... I received OEM ink packs, as if removed from a printer package. The note attached to the item is nothing short of deceit, stating that ""industry partner agreement to reduce packaging, etc"" - I work in the industry and know OEM from Retail... Granted they are the same ink carts, but not warrantied by epson, as they are OEM, with no lot-number attached. This is not what I paid for nor what I ordered. Will NOT order from 4inkjets again."
1,Beware of high capacity vs. low capacity,"Why does Epson make this so difficult. I can't figure out if it is cheaper to buy high capacity, low capacity, multi pack or what. I looked at Costco, who only carries low capacity multi pack. This is for one printer, too many choices. Come on Epson, make one size."
1,How much ink is in this?,"What's in this, about 1 oz of ink? You go through these like bottled water. I guess its obvious why Epson doesn't have clear ink containers like the knock offs -- you'ld see it was almost empty when you bought it."
4,"EXPENSIVE, but high quality","All these inks together in my Epson RX580 printer let me print photo lab quality photos, it's a great convenience, but if I'm doing a larger batch of photos, I would save money by taking them to a photo shop."
1,Epson printer can't recognize this Genuine inks.,"I have Epson Stylus Photo RX 595 and only used Genuine Epson Ink from Amazon.Yesterday, my Epson printer couldn't recognize the genuine Epson ink bought from Amazon.I followed troble shooting guide downloaded from Epson website but it doesn't work.Today, I went to Staples and bought another genuine epson ink, Light Magenta.Luckly, my Epson printer recognize this one.I already have two genuine Epson ink which my printer can't recognize.Don't buy Epson printer and save money."
2,not great,I was disappointed with the quality of prints I got after I started using these cartridges. Had to clean print heads each time I replaced a cartridge.
2,Epson Ink Should Be Cheaper,"T78 cartridges are supposed to have more ink, and they probably do. Still, I would like to pay perhaps $5 vs. $15. I don't run the budget/generic ink because they gum up the printer. This ink works fine."
1,This is great...if you have money to burn,"I was trying to see if I could light some $100 bills on fire. But I decided this is a faster way to shed my wealth. This printer will drink more ink than your SUV guzzles gas. This is the hummer of printers! Oooh, but what a ride!!"
4,Not SIX inks....,"Be careful, I wasn't...thought this was an excellent deal, and with free shipping is a decent deal instead. The customer image above shows all six inks, there is NO black ink. The product itself is of course excellent, real Epson ink in an Epson R260....excellent. But figure in buying black..."
1,misleading,"This is totally misleading! What I received is not what show on the picture! It was 5 cartridges in plastic bag which was cut, because there was removed black cartridge! And there was a sticker which say: ""Mark for China only""!!!"
4,So far so good,The item arrived quickly and was recognized fine by my R280 printer.I will try to remember to report back whether or not these cartridges last as long as store bought ones.
4,lowest price,i hope that these are as great as the classy ones being promoted by Epson...the price is terrific
5,Good Stuff,The same ink you can get through Epson. Works perfectly in my RX595. Glad that Amazon carries this. A relief to be able to add it to my order of other random items instead of making a special trip to town or separate purchase from another site.
5,"I give up, by original ink",I've tried other generic ink products many times but there is usually some kind of issue to deal with. This works.
1,Rejected,"These ""Epson"" Ink Cartridges were rejected by 2 of our Epson Artisan 50 printers. As A Matter offact - The printers have not accepted any new ""Genuine"" Epson cartridges since July 2010 and aregathering dust.Daniel James Tyler"
1,Epson should do better,"Like a lot of people, I try to keep spare inks on hand so I won't be stopped in my tracks in the middle of a printing job. However, the first ink I opened from this pack wasn't recognized by my printer, and as a result I couldn't print my sister's birthday present in time for her birthday. Thanks, Epson--if you're going to set your printers up not to print unless they have a new **Epson** ink cartridge, could you at least make sure your outlandishly priced inks are manufactured properly?"
5,Schroeder's Antiques Price Guide,"I am a personal property appraiser and I buy an updated version of this book every year. Why? There are approximately 450 people on the advisory board and a list of contributors in the back (with addresses and telephone numbers). I have found the information contained reliable. These people are experts in their respective fields who lecture and write on their subject. I have found them to be very helpful. I only call on them in unusual situations. While this information is not detailed enough to actually use for appraisals, it usually gets me headed in the right direction."
3,A little hotter please,"This was a charity benefit concert and I suspect that the audience was not a typical audience for Latin Jazz. In live performances, musicians feed off the audience but I wonder how empathetic the audience actually was here. The playing is highly professional throughout but it too often lacks real passion. For this type of music, that's a no no.Overall, the music is always interesting and ""Slowvisor"" and ""Camagueyanos y Habaneros"" are excellent. But if you're curious about Eddie Palmieri and looking for a first purchase, the place to start is ""Azucar Pa Ti""."
2,Not Flash at all,"The book is so badly edited as to chop off the conclusions of some sections. Not surprisingly, several exercises make no sense whatsoever due to this (and are of no use to anyone).The book is visually quite tough to use. It is hard to find a particular item. There are far too many typos and discrepancies between screengrabs and copy. Also the download page must be one of the oddest looking (and sloppiest) pages on the web - not a good advert for a company selling design books! Shame on you Osborne. What a waste of paper."
3,Just Ok,"I read the other review. The author skips important info vital to step by step creation of a movie. One usually has to stop and figure it out. I don't recommend this book for beginners. Instead of babling on, get a book that is direct and to the point...not this one."
1,Sucks! Don't waste your time,I got all the way to page 210 before figuring out that I wasn't going to learn Flash from this book. I learned more in 30 seconds from a YouTube video than I got out of a few hours of trying to understand this writer. Not good.
4,Good intro book for the money,"At its low price, for the introductory aspects of Flash, the best I found. Compact enough to reference quickly. There are quite a bit better books available at twice this price. Its useful to have separate references for the basic tools, and for advanced ActionScript -- as well as good links to the wealth of on-line Flash MX references and explanations."
1,Horrid book,"As a technology instructor, this book is the new epitome for poor editing and unclear instruction. I have tried to execute their exercizes only to find that they are either unclear, incomplete or JUST PLAIN WRONG!For a book entitled, ""How to Do Everything with Macromedia Flash MX"", they sure missed the mark. I'd be ashamed to have my name on the cover of this waste of natural resources.The book is useless. I'd rate it a -5 stars if I could."
1,"Terribly written, organized - highly confusing","This is simply a terrible book. As a few reviewers have mentioned, the organization is atrocious. There are sections on putting Flash on the web before you learn ANYTHING about Flash. Early chapters continuously assume that you know subjects from later on. Many of the descriptions of how to do things are simply wrong; I frequently had to stare at the screen agonizing over how to make something work, because following the description did nothing.Do yourself a big favor and stay far away from this book."
1,The worst book I have ever read!,"This book doesn't make any sense. It is so, so, so b-o-r-i-n-g. The book is not well written, and the sentences are way too short. I woudn't recommand this book to anyone."
4,A Thanksgiving Story,This book was enjoyable but kind of gross. Too graphic about Matthew's smell. You'd think his folks would know how bad he smelled and do somehting. I would have called CPS and reported it as child neglect. If a kid is that young and smells bad then that is poor personal hygeine and that is the parent's fault.
4,Yummy,"My third grade teacher read us this book during the fall holidays. At the age of 23, I still remember the title and how it made me like candy corn. I think it's a great story. I'm going to buy this book for my nephew."
2,Kids enjoy the story!,I've read this book with my third graders for the past several years. They love it. They enjoy having a candy corn contest of their own while reading the book.
4,Another Hit,"I discovered this series in my classroom two years ago and after reading Pickle Puss aloud I've decided to invest in the series. I've started from the first book reading it aloud to my third graders during breakfast and they LOVE it!! It's humorous, VERY relatable and great for teaching reading skills as you move through the story. I truly love these stories and all the characters within. I can't wait until we get to the next book..."
2,My child did not enjoy the read,"This book was a required read in my child's classroom so I purchased it, he did not like the book, he did not find it interesting, he said it was a boring read.I didn't find anything wrong with it, but I guess it just depends on your child's interest."
3,OK,I love the raspberry so I thought I'd try this. Not too crazy about it. The blueberries are huge but they are weird. Might be because I pick my own blueberries and am used to fresh. I'll stick with the raspberry.
1,Opinion from an instructor,"Unfortunately, I have to agree with one of the previous review. The book lacks consistency and logic. Just to mention one of the numerous flops - how you can talk about economic order quantity and not mention a material planner. The book is supposed to help an instructor. Well, it does the opposite."
2,Not very helpful,I just finished a Cost Accounting class and the professor did not have us use this book! He used his own notes and said the book was not very good.
1,Terrible Book,This book is garbage. It is just thrown together for the publisher and author to make money. It is a very superficial review of cost accounting.
4,"""Must Have"" for UC/Crohn's sufferers!","This book is a great resource for anyone who has UC or Crohn's (or anyone who knows/cares for someone with UC or Crohn's). This book offers validation for all of the many symptoms of the disease, many of which are not ""normally"" associated with an intestinal disorder. The chapter on surgery is by far best I have seen yet - it offers easy to understand diagrams to accompany the sometimes overwhelming verbal descriptions of the multiple surgeries available today.The only negative thing I can think of, is that Saibil tends to give the ""worst case scenario"" (which I appreciated but could potentially scare someone with mild UC or Crohns, or someone who has not been taught about their disease by their doctor). This book is an excellent reinforcement of everything your Gastroenterologist SHOULD be telling you!"
4,Great Book!,"This is a great book to start off learning about Crohn's disease and colitis. It explains the disease in easy to understand terms, including simple diagrams, signs, symptoms and especially drugs available and how they work. When I first when to my doctor, I did not even know what questions to ask. Now I have at least an idea what is going on and why the doctor does what she does. Additionally, the author of the book is credible, having trained at Mt. Sinai in NYC and is on the Medical Advisory Council of the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of Canada."
3,For New Comers Only!,"Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Cloitis is an excellent resource for those who are new to the disease. However, those of us who have had IBD for years will not find any new revelations to satisfy our needs."
5,An excellent review for patients,"Physician-author starts the book by reviewing the normal anatomy/physiology of gastrointestinal system. He then discusses what IBD (Crohn's or ulcerative colitis) is, what are the common signs and symptoms, and what is the role of diet and drugs as well as surgery. There are separate chapters on IBD in children as well on the high risk of cancer faced by these patients. Finally, the author ends by reviewing what the scientific future holds for the patients."
4,An excellent resource,"Sabil, attached to the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City, is a wonderful expert in the field of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and has contributed an excellent resource in the form of this book. Well-written and well designed, the book's layout is clear and logical. It contains the usual chapters of overview of the diseases, emotional factors, children with IBD, etc. but the surgical chapter is one of the better I've read in these many IBD books and the ""Living with IBD"" chapter is excellent. I'm not sure it's everything I need to know, but it encompasses quite a bit and it is an excellent reference source."
3,elementary education,I have had Crohns for almost twenty years. This is a book intended for those who have just discovered it. It is written pretty well but it did me little good. There are better books on this subject available.
3,occasional need,"I am very satisfied with this piece of equipment. The star rating is a reflection of the fact that I know the broader range of what is available. I do finish work around the house and occasionally else where. It does the job I need with baseboard, casing, various other moulding, etc. If one was going to use this type of saw regularly, more amps would be important."
3,cartridge W?,"How is the buyer to know that this item ships without a toner cartridge?""What's in the BoximageClass D320, cartridge W, User's Guide, setup instructions, CD-ROM, power cord, warranty card""What the heck is ""cartridge W?""Is that supposed to be the equivalent of ""w/o cartridge?""I'm not sure how I'm going to address this. It certainly would be a hassle to ship back something this heavy."
2,Toner Cartridge NOT included,Bought this thinking what a great deal but got the printer and it came without Toner Cartridge. No where does it every indicate that the printer does not included Toner Cartridge. I had to buy some one online but what a waste of time. Buyer BEWARE!!
3,too much knowledge presumed on the part of the author,"The physics are presented in a curt fashion and compelled several readings to understand much of what was said. Explanations of the Coriolis Effect were confusing and the term angular rotation speed was muddied in the explanations. The author assumes too much knowledge on the part of the reader. Typical of this was reference to the Rossby number without even explanation of the formula for this dimensionless number. Diagrams also presume formidable interpretive skills, see the Fig 1-6 on page 10. I cannot gainsay this author's erudition but his teaching skills are not up to the task for this subject. This is a book by someone so erudite in his field that he can no longer teach to new students."
5,Broad and Good Coverage,"As the author points out, this does fill the gap between novice (not beginner) and advanced books. That said, it is probably not for someone who is not really interested in weather forecasting as a serious hobby or profession. There is a wealth of information and it is organized very well. It is something that you will certainly want to pick up many times as your knowledge grows about this subject.The appendix has a good amount of information that will further research. At the end are a bunch of analysis charts so that you can apply your knowledge. This would also be suitable as college material and each chapter has some questions to reinforce the learning of the material."
5,Comments here do not apply to this edition,"I am the author. The negative review below refers to a much older copy of the book, which INDEED was photocopied and was not warranted otherwise. We have used offset printing now for the past 3 years with 4-color covers and true binding. ..."
2,Firewire adapter,"Item was delivered promptly. The reason I give it a poor review is because the way the adapter is connected to the computer gives me the impression that it could break at any time. I wonder why Maxtor does not provide the appropriate adaptor! Speedwise, performance is good."
5,Dana Chivers is a near genius,"I have had the extraordinary pleasure of enjoying Mr. Chivers guitar music in the magical land of Provence. This is the first recording of this particular composer so its special. Just wait till he comes out with his Tango album. His son, David Chivers and Dana are introducing a new CD of Matiegka duets which are unusual because they are for guitar and violin. BUY THIS ALBUM!"
2,decent screenplay ruined by less-than-stellar direction and lousy acting,"The only good thing here is Leslie Lee who plays Lisa. However, the entire flick is muddled by hack direction and actors who aren't very believable.A waste of time and money. Certain viewers may get a kick out of some of the trailers, though.Can't recommend this turkey. Sorry."
5,Chart tape was just what was needed,"The tape is hard to find locally.Apparently, graphics tend to be done more electronically than manually.I have another use for it - along with white tape, I use it for highway pavement markings on a scale model railroad."
4,"If you are a true BT Fan, You'll love this.",What more can I really say?What's nice about this one is that its all John. Not that the rest of BT pulls him down or anything. Its just nice to see a different side of John. The music resembles Blues Traveler but it is not the same so don't expect that if you're buying this CD.This peaceful sound is a must have for your collection.
4,suprisingly thoughtful,"after only two listens i love this record. it makes me wonder if john's been saving these creations for his solo showcase. in any case, it doesn't rock like bt but rolls & bounces in a very refreshing manner. excellent lead guitar by popper himself & solid drumming by carter beauford."
3,Zygote,"I have enjoyed most of John Popper's work, and this is no exception, save for one thing: if you're looking for the extensive harmonica sequences, this will be a disappointment to you. I hope this helps you in your quest for experiencing John Popper's unique gift for this highly under-rated instrument. Mr. Popper must have decided to keep this talent at bay, focusing more on his vocal talents. Growing in Dirt and Home portrays his best efforts at exploiting both harp and vocal harmonics."
5,Popper tries some more of his ideas-- with a different band.,"Popper is a musical genius. Not only does he wail on his harmonica, but he plays a mean lead guitar. This, coupled with the fact that Popper often records a couple of vocal tracks to accompany himself, makes this album a real testament to his versatility and ability. On the last song, you can really hear him stretching for Brian May's sound. This record is simply beautiful. To everyone that got to see him in Burlington, I proclaim my jealousy of you. John Popper is a true bard. His solo effort sends chills down my spine and inspires my own creativity. I am glad to have had the chance to hear him."
5,Great Album,This new album is very refreshing. Their sound seems to be a mix of southern rock and early nineties rock.
4,"A great album, but not if you already own ""Trace""","Son Volt is a great band who craft an excellent meld of rock, blues, country and folk music into something which manages to sound honest and bare. I bought this album for a couple of songs, I already owned ""Trace"" and since the album draws heavily from that great compilation, there's not much to add here.I do have to say that I did love many of the added tracks, particularly ""Tear-Stained Eye."" I hadn't heard their cover of Springsteen's ""Open All Night"" (which is one of my favorite songs by Bruce) but it doesn't compare favorably to the original. They slow it down and eliminate most of the verses."
4,Great body of songs but missing vital parts,"If you have never listened to Son Volt, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM! Son Volt is one of those bands that I will listen to for a very long time. I love their lyrics and style of playing and combining folk, blues, and rock music. However, this ""retrospective"" is missing several key songs including ""Catching On"", ""Cemetery Savior"", ""Right On Through"", ""Question"", ""Blind Hope"", ""Caryatid Easy"", and ""Live Free."" I am not the biggest Son Volt fan, but I at least know that these songs really define Son Volt's stint in the music industry, not covers or mediocre acoustic performances. This album, like many other compilations, is another lousy attempt by the record company to make a little more money off of a band that is stagnant. Son Volt still kicks ass."
1,shalow,"Illustrations, presentation and context are very shallow. The title deserves a more in-dept illustration of this ""ancient"" concept, but new revelation, of a very sophisticated theme."
5,Gained Knowledge!,"Once I purchased this book, it elevated my karate teaching and training. This book is not only about techniques, it actually emphasizes the balance within each. Learning these basic moves from white belt and beyond will help you sustain an adaptable and understanding of balance, agility, and stamina. You will surely become to understand each move on a personal level as you progress through the ranks, this is truly a recommended book for the serious Martial Artist!!Anisa M. Kinsey"
4,"Short but, excellent.","This book cannot be put down. I read this book in 5 hours, I am in [...]honors so this book was easy for me, I absolutely adored this book. I love how it went into flashbacks of times with her and Jack. Excellent book, purchase!"
3,confusing but OK,"Unlike the other reviewer, my dog stays in this harness, even when I try to get him out after forgetting to undo a buckle or two. It took a while to get the hang of it, but it's OK now. It keeps my dog away from the driving controls, but lets him sit up or lie down. Just be sure to keep the receipt handy- sizing these things is a bear."
1,Useless,Received a sealed Lexmark Twinpack with 2 dried-up cartridges that printed so badly they had to discarded. The ink expiration date appeared to have been covered up. Actually this is a zero star rating but at least 1 star was required to have this review accepted...
1,Kickland,"Based on the reviews I read here, I must be reading a different book. Putting aside the absurd probability of a father and two sons making any Olympic team, the writing is amaturish, the characters are cardboard cutouts, and I hear less preaching in Church on Sundays."
5,They're back!,"After the super album:""Another wasted night"" which is probably one of the best ever made, i expected a lot from this one, but was very disappointed when i got it, but after i while i got used to it, and now i love it. They still have the same sound, but the music is a bit cleaner. By the way, this album has over 20 songs on it, not 3 as listed."
3,more singing please,"The music and performances were great. I thought there was too much time spent making jokes, clowning around, etc. I thought Kevin Williams should have gotten a higher billing given the number of one-liners he had. Some may like the comedy/music mix, but for continued watching, I prefer the singing."
5,Instant Refund,Back in early January 2011 I ordered a dvd that was to arrive by February 4. I waited an extra week then contacted the seller to see if they could trace the order. Instead I was given an instant refund through Amazon. I appreciate the offer and will look for this seller any time I purchase online from Amazon. Thank you so much for your service. Alan Barton
2,I found the first part of this documentary interesting.,"It was a chance to take a look at ""real"" nuns and the work that they do. Unfortunately, the documentary quickly degenerates into one long complaint about the Catholic Church and how sexist it seems to be. There is no attempt at an unbiased view of the Church and her history here."
5,second order circuits (superior order),"I WOULD LIKE TO CHECK THE TECNICS OF THE ANALISIS OF CIRCUITS BASED IN THE TIME DOMAIN, USING THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF CIRCUITS THEORY; AS OHM'S LAW, CIRCUIT'S ELEMENTS (RESISTOR, POWER SOURCES, INDUCTORS, ETC.) THE TRANSFORMATION OF POWER SOURCES, NODES VOLTAGE ECUATIONS. SO I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN NEW TECNICS TO ANALIZE CIRCUITS ON THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN, AS FASORIAL ANALIZE, LAPLACE, FOURIER SERIES. THAT'S WHY I'M LOOKING FOR THIS BOOK CAUSE IT HAS ALL I NEED TO LEARN THIS. ALSO IT HAS GOOD EXAMPLES AND EXERCISES TO DO. HOPE YOU CAN HELP ME GETING THIS BOOK CAUSE I REALY NEED IT."
3,Not what I had in mind,"I had waited for an opportunity to get this and now that I have it, I have to admit to being disappointed. As other reviewers have pointed out, the color scheme is inaccurate; it's made of off-white plastic with other colors painted on. The other colors wouldn't be bad, except for the fact that the plastic itself makes it look too toy-like (yes, I'm aware of the irony). Furthermore, the phaser banks on the upper side of the warp pylons aren't painted. Also, unlike other Art Asylum Enterprises, almost nothing on this lights up. Just the Bussard scoops, the impulse engines and the deflector dish are equipped with lights. Finally, the fit on my ship is very loose; there are huge (relatively speaking) gaps in many of the seams. One could look in and see Geordi and Wesley having their ""who's the biggest nerd"" contest quite easily."
4,Enterprise E AA Toy,"Very well done Enterprise E. Some may not care for the paint job, but over all this is a very well done job. The sounds a light are the highlight of this ship. They take it from being a static model, and bring it to life. Kudos to AA for thier line of Star Trek toys."
2,PcAnywhere For Dummies,Book is outdated and is not compatible with the latest version (10.0 - 10.5). It is also limited to dial up connections and contains very little on connecting via internet.
1,Take it off the shelf,"This book is out of date. It is for an earlier version of pcAnywhere, version 9, not the current version 10."
2,Price Increase!,"These are delicious, EXCEPT that I brought the same thing about 3 months ago for $28 with free shipping. Guess I won't be ordering these at an average of $4 per pack since I can got get them at whole foods for about $3.50. Excellent deal guys:)"
4,The Hosta Book,Being new to hostas I was looking for information that would help me with my gardening. It was helpfull but I needed more detailed information.
1,Useless,"A very useless book if you are looking for what ails Hosta's and what to do about these problems. If you are having any problems, don't waste your money on this book as I have."
5,I have met a new Friend - Mini Hosta's,"I saw my first Mini Hosta in May and fell in love. They are the cutest plants I have ever seen. I was never interested in Hosta's, of any size, now I have 22 total in all the sizes. But the minatures are my favorite."
4,Decent romance,"Most of the book is about Pasquale chasing after Suki and trying to convince her to become his lover. The consummation of their relationship takes so long to take place that it is kind of deflating but the course to get their is thrilling enough so I didn't mind too much.But from there, the story goes right over to almost the ending from there and there is too much of a wrapped-up feeling. There is no in-between; showing of the sharing of emotions, of interaction between the two. Why do they like each other than the sexual chemistry? Attraction isn't love and although I believe that they love each other, I would like to know why."
4,excelent guide for the foundation of Hatha practice,"Not only is this video made with great love and serenity - but technical accuracy and safety. Anyone of any level of experience can benefit from this video. For the beginner, the asanas are explained and demonstrated in a conscise fashion and for the more advanced student, give an ideal study of proper free flowing form. So often yoga styles give pretense to be the only accurate guideline as to proper technique. Sivananda Yoga makes no excuses or apologies - simply offers yoga in its pure form. Relaxation, good health, a loving heart and the growth of the self. Not physical perfection as the goal but as a tool toward greater spiritual happiness. These basic Asanas and Pranayama will give ANYONE a strong foundation of the family of postures and lead one into the logical and progressive understanding of variations in any style. As a yoga teacher, I highly reccomend this video for anyone interested in learning about the experience of Hatha Yoga"
1,Totally Dissatisfied,"The speaker is very bad, the music, not good.The actual routine goes too fast.How do they expect begginers to follow this routine?"
5,Handel & Pushee - a heavenly duo!,"The two names 'Handel' and 'Pushee' are sufficient to send a shiver down a music lover's spine and this recording does not disappoint. All the wonderful Handel arias are represented. The quality of the recording is exceptional, even though it is now some years old. If the incredibly beautiful music of Handel causes your heart to hesitate for just a second and brings a lump to your throat, then the combination of Handel and Pushee will make the tears flow freely; but it will also refresh and restore you. This is a wonderful recording if you enjoy the Baroque and the pure voice of a countertenor."
4,Hypnotic (perhaps to a fault),"Of the 5 CDs released by KCRW, this is my favorite. They are all very good, but ""Morning Becomes Eclectic"" has more of my favorite music. The covers by Mehldau and Martyn are amazing, as is PJ Harvey's performance. I was also pleasantly surprised by ""All I Need."" And for those of you who prefer something a little more firmiliar, Semisonic and Sixpence None The Richer add their two cents. All together this is a great record. If there is one flaw, it is that the songs are all on the soft side, which means there is always the risk of being lulled to sleep or into some kind of trance. Not that that's a bad thing -- and considering all of this music was recorded on a morning show, it's understandable. I highly reccomend the whole series."
2,Only Useful as an Overview,"This map will only be useful to you if you don't have any other basic resources, like a general world atlas or travel guides, at home.The main map itself shows the entire South Pacific region, with country boundaries clearly marked, but individual islands reduced to the size of dots.Major islands are shown on inset maps, however even these are still tiny - you will find bigger, more detailed, and more accurate maps of the same islands (and many more) in travel guidebooks to this region by Lonely Planet or Moon.In short, unless you just want a general map to hang on your wall, don't waste your money on this one!"
3,Some mistakes in multiple-choice results,Some mistakes in multiple-choice results. This book really needs to be corrected. Also they don't send free stimulation CD as they promised when we buy this book.
2,Errors galore,"Yes, this book was very poorly edited. All the new parts such as Economics have incorrect answers in the back. Very distracting when you're trying to hunker down and study. There's one part where the answer key actually says 3 + 4 = 5 . Which, if you were just glancing over the answers, would really throw you for a loop. But on a positive note, i passed the BEC section with an 82."
2,Not Barska's Best,Bought these for my father after buying a set of Barska Huntmasters for myself and thought these would be similar. These are NOT the same quality as the Huntmaster line. Spend a little more money and get a much better set of binos.
4,Not easy out of the box.,Difficult to make & understand the initial setup. No understandable instructions. The product seems to be excellent once you figure out how to adjust to your personal vision.
2,no way,"poor quality. I ordered these binocs and when they came in, wow! unable to focus and fuzzy around the outer edges. Sent them back for a replacement, and the same thing. Not clear at all. I sent them back for a refund. For the price, usually BARSKA is a great deal, but on these BLACKHAWK binocs something went wrong. If your a half way serious hunter, I highly suggest you bone-up and spend the extra cash for a higher quality brand of binocs. I have other BARSKA products and they are great, just this line of binocs has poor glass or prisms or something. I dont know.I must say, the return policy and procedures with AMAZON! is great. My replacement pair was here before i even sent the old ones back. I just sent the second pair back for a refund so I hope that its as fast as the return was. I will be shopping with AMAZON! again."
5,Parenting expert/author comments on Rocky Road book,"I like short reads. I wrote a short read. Through the Rocky Road is a delicious collection of short reads about joy, hope, disappointment, learning, love, sadness and laughter. It's one of those keep-by-the-side-of-the-bed books you can pick up, enjoy a portion, then go on with your day digesting its message. The author shares true stories and reveals her humanness in a way that anyone can relate to. This is not an advice book but one of gentle, encouraging navigation through the rocky roads of life."
3,3 out of 4 isn't too bad,"Of the four bulbs, three worked fine. Unfortunately, the fourth glimmered faintly, then gave it up completely, right out of the package. I wasn't paying attention, so I ended up with $5 in shipping. This brought the total to over $6. I advise others to do what I will do in the future, and purchase 4 bulbs from Walmart for $1.50, getting 4 for the price of one of these."
2,Special Letter....,"BEWARE, this does not come with George, but Lady. If you are like me, you look for the great deals where the DVD comes with the free toy. It is very disappointing because this is the THIRD time I ordered a DVD that misadvertised the toy. My son loves the DVD, but it has episodes with George that I know he would have loved re-enacting. Now I have to go buy George separately. Again, very disappointing."
5,An alltime best!,"When I was little, I ""discovered"" the original J&DE; LPs. They've been my secret passion, better than chocolate, ever since--for well over 40 years. I've even used some of the songs' ""mixed meters"" as graduate-level metric dictation in my music theory ear-training teaching! I've shared them with very best friends, as a show of closeness in our relationship.Buy all of these you can get hold of. They'll change your life!Warning: The sounds themselves are difficult for highly sensitive musical ears to hear. A suggestion: First describe the cd's humor and get a commitment to listen from The Ears. They'll then enjoy the humor in the midst of aural madness."
4,Very Cute,"We got this as the baby to the bigger size rhino, it is very cute. It is a little scrawny looking but it not make a difference to him! Good quality and very soft."
2,it was ok,"The delivery was very prompt, and the item was exactly as described. The music was not as sensual as I thought it would or could have been, so that was a disappointment. I will order from this seller again."
5,A great purchase,"This product is everything the reviews state - a great picture, an easy to use DVD player. What more could I ask for the bargain price? Installation and set up were as simple as ""plug and play!"""
1,Good TV --- until it died prematurely,"Except for the sound being slightly weak, this was initially a good TV for the money. Warranty is 6 months parts and labor, 12 months parts only. Mine quit working in month 7, repair labor was estimated at $130 so I decided to junk it. This set is manufactured by the Korean corporation Funai, which apparently owns the Sylvania, Emerson, and Symphonic brand names."
1,NOT AS PICTURED,"Beware Buyers, this product is no longer sold as pictured. It arrived swiftly from Amazon's sub contractor, in this case Electronics Express; but although the box featured the correct model ID #, the photo on the front was way different from that shown online by Amazon. I tracked this down w/both Electronics Express and Sylvania; apparently the model design has changed and the old one is no longer available. It's the first problem I've ever had w/Amazon, which I've otherwise enjoyed a 100% happy relationship with over the years. Oh and P.S., my refund was handled swiftly and efficiently. I rated the product 1 star just to get the review published (no stars; no publish)."
2,"A nice TV, but the DVD player died",I bought this TV as a Christmas gift for my husband and we put it in the bedroom. The DVD player just died with no warning and is not worth the cost ($265!) of repairing. Wouldn't you know the warranty just ran out in December. The manufacturer was of no help whatsoever. I'll never buy another Sylvania product.
4,worth the money,"I purchased this product for my daughter. She saved for over a year and paid for it herself. After a lot of research and searching for the right price; we found this item. The picture quality is great, the sound is great and the fact that there is a built in dvd player was a plus. My daughter and I are really pleased and the price was a great deal. I would reccomend it to others."
3,Not the same stuff as it used to be,Pyrex used to be all borosilicate glass. Now the labratory pyrex is still borosilicate but the made for the home pyrex is now soda lime glass and has been for the past 10 years.The old stuff your grandmother has is the top grade stuff as is the European pyrex.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrex
3,Cracked,"I still have the smaller dish and the pie dish so I gave the product a three. Shortly after I bought the set the large pan cracked in my oven, not only did I loose the pan but my dinner. I am not sure why because I have had other Pyrex products before that were great. I would warn not to cook on temps over 350 and if that was the problem they should put that as a warning on the package."
3,they're fine,"they're terry cloth wristbands. you already should know what you're getting. I wish they were a few bucks cheaper, but there's really nothing to complain about.They are surprisingly water retentive though. I swam with them on and even in the dry AZ weather they still took like 3 days to dry out. That was kind of surprising, but doesn't effect anything about them. It's just an interesting anecdote."
3,Iggy Pop - 'Jesus Loves The Stooges' (Bomp) 3-track EP,"A nifty CD single to have,BUT way too steep for just three(3)cuts.Track listing:""Jesus Loves The Stooges""-alternative take(4:49),""Johanna""(3:16) and ""Consolation Prizes""(3:24).Obviously,this title is aimed toward the completists."
4,"If you like bad movies, you will love this set!","This is an amazing double feature, 2 of the most unintentionally funny, so bad there good slashers ever, there are a lot of good reviews for both flicks on Amazon already if you look up the titles individually, Ill just add that for this set both films are presented in 16x9 widescreen and the prints and transfers look great, there are also some great grindhouse trailers, and a commentary track with the guys from Cinema Head Cheese MST3K style on Don't Go Into the Woods that is actually really funny, but even without it these are some seriously funny flicks."
5,"Enjoyable double feature, but...","Ill make this quick. I really enjoyed both of these movies. Exploitation Cinema puts out some good double feature and some bad ones. This one falls in the good category, but why in the world is it so expensive. I bought this double feature for $25.00"
5,Ignore the review below...,"Ok, this might not be the BEST written book on evangelism and Bonnke maybe couldn't been more exegetical, theological, philosophical in his hermeneutical approach to the original Hebrew and Greek... Er.... Whatever. Here is a man who has dedicated his life to evangelizing Africa because God told him to and you know what, he sees over 1 MILLION people saved in a SINGLE CRUSADE.If that doesn't mean we should listen to what He has to say I think we have a problem because I don't care who you are, there is NO ONE on this entire earth that can assemble over 1 million people in one place for one purpose except Jesus and if He is helping Bonnke, I think I wanna know more..."
4,"Detailed designs, but not 1:64","This diecast Toyota MR-2 Spyder has some really detailed design and it is really badass with the low car body. But there is one problem, it is definitely not a 1:64 model. I have a collection of 1:64 cars from Japanese companies like TACCAR and Tomica, those are real 1:04 models, but when I put this together with them, this American model is way, way larger than them, it looks more like a 1:58 to me, it looks awkward with my other model cars."
5,"Accessible,entertaining, amazing, a must read for all ages.","I love it. I received only a few days ago and I already finished it. I must read it again and again. It is well written in an easy style accessible to all and nicely illustrated. The contents seem to be more science fiction thatn science facts, they are so incredible. I love it as I already wrote and you willl too. Don't wait, buy it now. Amazon.com can ship it in a record time and the price is excellent value for money for this highly entertaining book."
3,"Fun, but with a lot of small errors","This is an enjoyable book, with a lot of interesting information. It also has many small scientific errors that a professional scientist would never make - almost every page has some small error of wording or description. I'm just a layman, so I don't know what a professional would find. There is enough new and interesting material to far outweigh the errors, but you should not assume that everything you find here is repeatable as truth."
5,Perfect Replacement,"I purchased a used Toyota Tacoma. It had only 1 remote and the dealer was too expensive. I wanted a second remote as a back up. After doing extensive research I found this on Amazon for a new OEM remote. It arrived and was exactly as described, a brand new remote with instructions. I followed everything on the sheet and it works perfectly...actually better than the one I had even after replacing the battery.Great product."
5,Series 1 and 2. If the BBC only made Series 3,"Yes, this Series 1 DVD is very good. It starts off slow to a nice climatic end in the White Mountains. Series 2 DVD is just fantastic in the Tripod city. I loved watching this on PBS in the 80s. I'm glad I now have Series 1 and 2 on DVD, but alas Series 3 was never made by the BBC. And the stars are in there 40s, so it's not like they can reprise the roles. What could have been..."
4,wow,This dvd has many different kinds of music from Jazz to classical from all over the world.a delight from start to finish.The sound tracks in 5.1 dolby digital & 5.1 dts adds great sound with a home theater system.
3,I enjoyed it but he has done better,"I picked this up in my flamenco stage two years ago and never got around to listening to it. Saw ottmar live for the 1st time several weeks ago and wanted to go back and listen to all his stuff I own.I have read the other reviews and they seems to be fair. My take, he puts a flamenco twist on some notable tunes which are interesting. Ultimately, I got tired of listening to it and moved on. Some of it just sounded so much of the same."
1,poor recommendation,"I bought this on Amazons recomendation & can't stand it. I wanted neuvo Flaminco & this sounnds like Moog synthecizer elevator music I like the earlier work of this Atrist, the neuvo Flaminco.. & of course once you open the package its too late to return it... so I'm stuck with their recomendation."
5,Better than wax removal wipes,"This wax remover is brilliant. It works better than the wax removal wipes which come in the box with the wax. Safe and easy to use all over your body. I just rub it on, jump in the shower, and all residue is removed. Also this bottle is lasting me a really long time. Granted I don't wax all the time, but you don't need to apply much for it to be effective. Definitely will buy again."
3,Works Ok,Used this after waxing my legs. Wouldn't remove the leftover wax fully. I had to rub the wax off manually with my hands like you would a sticker stuck on a lighter.
3,Clean & Easy Remove After Cleanser,"This oil is ok. It removes wax residues from your skin, but as far as to really clean the plastic roller head or anything else it doesn't really work well. It is as if it were just regular baby oil."
2,Came late and the pages are loose.,The book arrived late and the pages came off the hardcover binding. I now understand why it was on sale. I just glued it myself. It would be a waste of time sending it back.
5,"Blue Ridge Summit, the beginnings","This book is a excellent local history covering the beginnings of Blue Ridge Summit, the now bygone resort community and its local residents in four counties, two in Pennsylvania and two in Maryland adjacent to the Western Maryland Railways' Pen Mar Park from its early vacationers to their decline in the 1930's. Some of the shenanigans of its early residents are interesting, especially about the counterfeiters!"
4,good,It's ok for the price. Wish it didn't burn so quickly and had more pieces. These burn extremely quick :(
2,Shame on the Wiggles,"All this video is is a compilation of the tv shows. Nothing new, nothing exciting. What a rip off, luckily we borrowed it from the library and didn't spend the money on it."
2,Same Old Songs,"I agree with the other two reviewers that the Wiggles really need some fresh material! This is completely recycled songs just sung in front of a different set. And yes, there are 3 or 4 songs sung in spanish that my kids were completely disinterested in. We love the Wiggles, have seen them in concert twice and have a lot of their DVD's. But, this one really bores.Please guys, get us some new stuff!"
5,The Wiggles reign in our house.,"What can anyone say about the Wiggles? They're entertaining, talented and kids love them. This particular DVD was one of the first we introduced to our now 20 month old grandson when he was about six months old. We've purchased many since, all of which he likes, but this remains one of his favorites, especially when he needs a DVD with some talking along with the singing. It's still musical but includes some talking thus giving him a little ""down"" time. Definitely one of the best of our Wiggles collection."
3,More of the same,"This book is collection of short stories about Hunter Rose, like Grendel: Black, White and Red. Sometimes script reminds me of Road Runner cartoon because it is so repetitive.I think that, if you like Hunter, you should read these two books AND ""Devil by Deed"". After it, continue with ""Devils child"" and you will read the best of the best considering pre-nuclear Grendel tales...uh stories"
5,Lovely!,"When I went into Toys R Us today merely to check for new Barbie clothes for my Pullip dolls, I had no intention of buying this lovely girl.I skimmed through the Bratz section just to see what was there. My companion pointed out the Yasmin Kidz doll, and I thought she was very cute, but not my cup o' tea. I searched for a Cloe since she's my favourite- *Points to Cloe army* -and found her. I promptly fell in love.Her hair is very pretty, it reminds me of Sun-kissed Cloe's hair, minus the braids. Her face is very cute, and I like her body proportions.The clothes are well made, and she's the perfect size for carrying around. I cannot recommend her enough! If you like Cloe, you should defidentely get this girl.-Taffy"
3,Recommended Reading by nervegas.com,"""Forestry Pesticide Aerial Spraying"" is a book that shows that the science and technology of aerial spraying is still evolving.This is a great book on aerial spraying due to the lack of basic literature on the state of the art. It presents the current state of the art and some of the problems (like inaccurate sizing methods in wind tunnels).Obvious from this book is that aerial spraying has moved beyond basic fluid mechanics into the information age. Discusses the auditing capabilities with GPS. Much of the emphasis remains on nozzels and dispersion modeling, but the uniqueness of forestry stands in this arena are well discussed.This is the sort of book that should be read by anyone that wants to understand the design problems of aerial spray systems and the operational consiquences."
5,Mother knew best,"My mother owned one of the most elegant gift shops in Los Angeles. So when looking for glasses for my son, she reccommended Reidel stemware. Why? Beauty for one, elegance for another and then, who knew, better glasses do not break as easily! My son already tipped one over on his kitchen counter with no loss of integrity. I understand why one should buy excellent glassware."
4,Excellent Value,This is an excellent value for an instrument with damping particularly since it comes with a protective carrying case and plumb bob.
4,Allow room for cable,"Works Great, Just what I needed.This unit is small physically, so allow room around the switch for gauge #2 cables to bend. There will be cable coming from three sides of the switch."
2,Bolts Missing From Package,"I was disappointed that the 4 bolts that hold the two halves of the switch together were not included. The picture appears to show them. Makes me wonder if they just sent me a returned or used switch ! Normally I wouldn't care, but these have to be size 10 bolts that are 4"" long to work. Not a very common size to have just laying around."
5,Battery ON Battery OFF,I purchased this to be able to completely shut down the electrical system for my new boat. It works flawlessly and was very easy to mount. This is by far the best way to control your batteries while in your boat.
5,Loved -- except for 1 super hot batch,"I thoroughly enjoy these crackers. But one time, they were much too hot to eat (as another reviewer mentions). However, usually they're just nicely warm."
3,Not what I expected!,"I have been buying Suzies chili garlic crackers for quite a while because they're my favorite. So when I saw what a good deal I could get a whole case for I was thrilled! However I was disappointed when I got them because they just tasted like the regular saltine crackers. Not at all like chili garlic! I'm wondering if anyone else has complained about this? Or if the packaging could be wrong? I tried to call the number on the package several times during business hours but no one at any extension was available to take my call. They're still good, just not what I really wanted."
1,Don't Purchase This DVD - It is Not a Documentary,"I wouldn't call this a documentary. It is just home movie footage set to stock music with occasional text describing some of the content. It is not a review of ""the turbulent history of many lost attractions"" nor the ""history of the World's Fair and its influence on modern theme parks"" as the DVD cover claims. The footage is poor and the majority of it contains no narrative or voice over. The only segment worth looking at is a commercial for Freedomland that can be viewed on YouTube. Don't waste your money on purchasing this DVD. If you do, you will greatly be disappointed."
2,Fun Footage but Few Facts.,"There is a lot of interesting footage here, but the historical inaccuracies are appalling for an alleged documentary. The most glaring was for the New York Worlds Fair of 1964. The footage of the fair construction was narrated from an old newsreel, but the following color footage was of the 1939 Worlds Fair (great footage). Unfortunately the captions refer to this as the 1964 Worlds Fair. They even claim the parachute jump was from the 1964 World's Fair! It certainly was not. The panoramas of the rides in the fun zone are captioned with misinformation about Walt Disney using the rides in Disneyland. Wrong again about that date.The segment of Boardwalk and Baseball the defunct park in Florida fails to mention that it was build from the remains of Circus World, yet another failed park. Just a nice it of historical trivia that could have been used and wasn't.Overall, not much of a documentary, but fun footage if you ignore the captions."
3,All or nothing?,"Stopes declared that ""Every heart desires a mate"" and then goes at length to write an account of the problems of love in marriage, the institution intended to be the public icon of committed love. Yet she shows just how marriage can in fact be an obstacle to love. She feared that marriage, though an important part of a woman's desire, might just be the thing that ends a woman's intellectualism as soon as she is enslaved in it. It was a book written when society had barely cast off the chains of Victorian prudishness, and when people were still coy about discussing sex. It is an interesting book from a psycholical point of view. It was a personal account, in many ways, of a woman ahead of her times; but this account may no longer be of interest in modern times where sex is more common than love - which may not really represent a change from Stopes' days except that people now are more openly relaxed when talking about sex and the disappointment of love."
1,I was all for buying it...,"Until I read in the introductory pages that she was all for eugenics. Since I can't trust the opinion of one who thinks that one ""race"" is more superior to all others, I think I'll pass."
1,Utter garbage,It felt to me like this book was written by an angsty teen who doesn't know how to deal with life. A poor first novel. Don't give up your day job.
5,Inkmarks on Pages,"This album shows a breadth of experience of living that is wonderful. Heartfelt yet funky with a New Orleans feel. Liz's voice is unsurpassed, joining the likes of Bonnie Raitt and Shawn Colvin. Just wonderful."
5,Neo-classical Salute to Bach,"The Orpheus Chamber Orchestra's conductorless Stravinsky is very accomplished as evidenced by an evenly matched and 'finished' instrumental tone, accuracy of pitch and a tight ensemble that expose a tremendous degree of detail. But there is poetry and passion in all this precision too. Both Orpheus and Danses concertantes receive delicate and sensitive playing from the orchestra.Orpheus especially is not an easy score to bring off since much of it dwells between mezzo-forte and pianissimo. In a piece that is a study in stoical detachment, the OCO manage to bring out a degree of expressive playfulness and character.At 50 minutes, this CD isn't very generous, but it is an impeccable contribution to Stravinsky's neo-classical period. I strongly recommend it."
4,Good for Cooking for a Large Group,"Made to typical high Calphalon quality standards, this griddle works well on our smooth top stove, but would likely work better had we ""bridge"" elements between the main elements. Thus, there are spots on the griddle that get hotter than others. Some cooks may find this desirable.I would prefer that it be long enough to fit side-to side across the stove over cooking elements. To completely cover two elements, it has to be placed front-to-back."
5,Offering Basics without being simplistic.,"'Semiotics: the Basics' is remarkable for its clarity but never simplistic. From Saussure to Barthes, from Peirce to Eco, from Freud to Lacan and Derrida, Daniel Chandler offers a compelling and deeply insightful tour through the labyrinths of structuralism, sign systems, mediation, deconstruction, and other themes. Chandler delivers an essential summary of the major ideas in semiotics theory, but with careful sensitivity to those who are new to these ideas. His explanations are rich with examples. Where appropriate, he relates classical semiotics thinking to the highly mediated, postmodern world of mass communication. Chandler's online 'Semiotics for Beginners' has become the most often referred electronic text on the subject. 'Semiotics: the Basics' will undoubtely become a standard introductory text in undergraduate courses covering any aspect of contemporary communication theory."
4,Superb Introduction,"Chandler's book is a highly condensed but remarkably lucid overview of semiotics. He combines a keen sense of the historical development of the field with a clear-headed (and much appreciated) delineation of the various semiotic schools. Chandler tosses about jargon with enthusiastic abandon, and although this will no doubt put off some readers -- especially students coming to the discipline for the first time -- the inclusion of a comprehension glossary will help to put most of those concerns to rest."
2,Still seasick,"I used this product before snorkeling in the ocean, and I still felt quite sick. I didn't vomit, but I also quickly got out of the water when I realized my stomach wasn't happy with the constant rocking from the waves. This may have decreased the nausea, but it's difficult to know for sure."
5,Amazing Conversation Starter,My boyfriend bought me this for my birthday a couple of years ago. He found it in a little locally owned gift shop. We love it! Every time we have guests their eyes are imediately drawn to it and it's a great ice breaker. We have yet to find the elusive penny!! I have a permit offer of an award for anyone who finds the penny in my Find It!
4,Great for road trips,"there has been so many times that i would dread the cleaning of the vehicle from a recent road trip... this game solves that problem. Everything is contained in one little cylinder! We spent a great length of time playing this in the toy store, and I have since gone back to get it for a Christmas gift. I know my 8 year old will love it."
2,Not a mystery (A politicaL statement!),"If you are a liberal democrat, like Cindy Shehan and Michael Moore, you may like this book, other wise forget it. TJ used to book to spout her unamerican personal views."
3,Wait for the paperback....,"I won't rehash the plot other than to say EEKnight has a great imagination and an even better ability to convey his ideas convincingly.My problems with the book is that the action is not as intense as in the previous novels. EEKnight raised the bar so high that even he has trouble meeting it. I felt the pace was too slow, at least for me.I was also surprised by the revelations about Alessa's character, particularly how she tried to create a fight between the legworm tribes. I felt that this was not the action of the woman we had met earlier.Finally, the ending floored me. It was wholly unexpected and not how I think Valentine would have acted. I can only explain it away by hoping he was under a Kurian lord's control at that moment.Having said all that, EEKnight is a good writer with a great story. He obviously has a lot more to tell us about Vampire Earth. And I am definitely going to go out and buy the next installment."
1,Worst DVD I Have Ever Bought!,"I was skeptical at first on buying this one but I said what the hell and I bought it. Well after taking it home and popping this one in I was extremely pissed when I started to watch Inglorious Bastards 2 I realized that the company took the widescreen version and chopped off over 25% of the picture and trust me, it is very noticeable! This is seriously the worst dvd purchase I have ever done! Save yourself money and avoid this dvd at all costs!"
5,It is what it is,"I can't think of much to say about a charger, other than that it works just as it should. Not a bad price to have a spare or to replace the one your cat decided to eat ;)"
1,What's the point?,"Why write an ""autobiography"" that is actually pure fiction? This book is trite, episodic and pointless. The ""Autobiography of Paul Bunyan"" might be a good follow up to this one. This is utter nonsense without any true historical relevance."
5,painted dreams,"Is a really good book!!! Easy for kids to learn. I will recommend this book to other family, THE PICTURE ARE GREAT"
1,Voodoo inside - not for Christians,"I am a Christian and would not have purchased this book if I knew it had a Voodoo doctor. The children in the book are afraid of the Voodoo doctor but it later portrays him as friendly. He tells the girl in the story her painting talent is a ""gift from the spirits"". I would say it was a gift from God. Voodoo is evil. (We adopted four children from Haiti. The older children in the orphanage were afraid of Voodoo. One of our daughters told us every time their neighbor practiced Voodoo, her birth mother started praying to Jesus.) I wish Voodoo wasn't in the book, or at least not portrayed in a positive manner. My daughter is very uncomfortable with this book."
2,somewhat tiresome,"The book started out interesting, but about half way through, it got tiresome. The villians were predictable and the plot far to slow.At 70 pages from the end...just didn't care anymore. Those last few pages were really hard to get through, yet should have been the best part of the book. Sorry just can't recommend this one."
2,The bad guys deserved to win,"I did not like this book. In previous reading I liked her Flesh and Spirit, Breath and Bone - the lighthouse books. Her stories are apocalyptically ominous and the bad guys are scary evil, but in the light house duo there was a sense of possible redemption to sustain you, and the other worldly part about the Danae was unique and compelling. Not so with the Son of Avonar books. This first book devolves into a half a book long chase scene where the enemy Zhid are so constantly a step ahead of our heros that by the time a possible redeeming outcome developed I'd lost all heart. If the bad guys are that powerful they deserve to win. It was depressing. The magic in the book seemed too powerful and the story line too convoluted to allow forgivable suspension of disbelief.There is a strong female heroine in the story, and if you are looking for a strange fantasy romance story the book might work."
5,Excellent 4 book fantasy series,"Carol Berg is an excellent writer. I love all four books. This story is told in first person. Seri is a middle aged woman living alone on a small farm. She has been exiled from her homeland and has lost everything. One day a crazy, rude, and naked man bumps into her and the new life she has created for herself falls apart. Ms Berg takes us on two interlocking journeys -- one through Seri's past and another through her present. Seri's story is brought to life as she attempts to help this mysterious man. You experience her love, joy, loss and renewal first hand. Berg does not shelter you from her pain. Berg is not afraid to do the unexpected. Prepare for a wild ride."
4,Romantic Fantasy,"Although one who likes the more fighting fantasy, this one did keep my attention. The characters are some of the better, more realistic ones than I've read in many a story.Seriana Marguerite, who entered a life of exile after her family was murdered. During her exile, she meets a stranger named D'Natheil. An odd and mysterious figure, he and Seriana don't initially get along and it takes some time before they come to an understanding of sorts. Perhaps it was the mysteriousness of him that drew her, but for whatever reason, she is drawn to find out more of his past.A good story if a bit on the romantic side."
2,Drags,This book was replete with historical details of multiple characters and groups; definitely a laborious trod through too much information and detail. Only determination and hope carried me to the last page. Hoping that book 2 brings some action and intrigue!
3,not bad but....,"this was my first Carol Berg book. it started out strong with an interesting character and setting, but sort of petered out for me as it went on.*****SPOILER below*****the main two things that turned me off from the book:1) towards the middle, the writing seemed to me to lean towards ""telling"", and not showing.2) i was uncomfortable with, what seemed to me, the incorporation of negative racial stereotypes in the characterization, both physical and mental, of Baglos."
3,Not my way of telling a story,"The way the story is told, 1st person, is not my way of telling a story, I just didn't like the perspective."
1,The Bridge of D'Arnath - all 4 books,"This series is the worse batch of nonsensical brutality I have ever come across. The writing is poor and the theme (such as it is) is unbelievable. A complete waste of time and money. I did not pass the books along, I deposited them in the garbage can.Advice to the author: Go back to writing school."
4,"Not too shabby, but hard to get into","This is the first book I've read by Carol Berg. I thought her writing was colorful, descriptive, and enjoyable, but it took me longer than I would have liked to identify with any of the characters, and to actually get hooked into the story. Much better than a lot of the fantasy drivel being released these days, though. Recommended."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable cozy read!,"I bought this book on a whim, thinking that the plot synopsis sounded interesting enough to give it a try. I wasn't particularly expecting anything great, but was very pleasantly surprised by the story. It grabbed my interest right from the first page, and drew me in. The Brenda Midnight character came across as someone who was willing to go out and be herself, but was also not a character so gung-ho about doing everything that she would grate on my nerves. Just enough of both spunk and a certain amount of worry to seem very real. And I liked the fact that some of what happened to her - and what caused her to be heralded as a heroine - just fell into her lap by accident. She didn't solve everything by brilliant deduction."
2,Lame,"The series has potential, but the first book was very lame.From the weak plot to the one-dimensional characters, the book lacked any depth. There was so much silliness -- from the cops who ""forgot"" to withhold something from the public to the way Brenda finagles her way into a temp job at the law firm to the private eye wannabe ex-boyfriend -- and it just kept getting more ridiculous as it went along.I certainly hope this series improves as it goes along, because it really does have potential."
5,Great writers on a great team,"The revised version of ""The Red Sox Reader"" is an improvement on a book that was already terrific (I have the mid-80s version and the 1999 revision). Great writing about the Sox, about their infamous ups and downs, and the triumphs along the way. Dan Riley has done an outstanding job editing this collection, as well as contributing tremendous pieces of his own. This is a must for any Red Sox fan and anyone who loves the great game of baseball. I can't recommend it highly enough."
3,ok its so-so,ok but not what I was looking for. I wanted American styleItalian dishes. but was fun reading. Maybe one of her other books might be what I'm looking for.
3,Good idea but poorly executed...,"The first 90 pages or so are filled with good information that make the purchase worthwhile. The remainder feels like it was put together in a hurry.Listed in the middle of the ingredients list is the equipment you'll need. That's a bit clumsy and awkward.The photos (none are of dishes, all are of Marcella either alone or with her classes) are fuzzy. None serve any purpose, and in a few, such as the one on page 161, she does not look like she is in good health.As for the recipes they are a bit of a disappointment, the homemade pasta and gnocchi chapter, for example, offers just one gnocchi recipe with no additional instructions for making a quality gnocchi. More attention is given to making bread crumbs than what makes for a good gnocchi.This book was a good idea, but after page 90 it is poorly executed."
3,A word of warning,"There are several recipes in this cookbook that refer to MH's previous books, saying things like ""Prepare the meat in the manner described in ""At Master Class"", page 80."" If you don't have the other cookbooks, you are out of luck. I've never seen this done before, and I can't say that I care for it."
4,slow at delivery,The book was in fabulous condition. I was very pleased with it. I needed to use it in my classroom and thought I would have it faster than I did. It was 16 days from the online ordering to the delivery at my house - a little longer than I would have liked.
5,Fantastic book!,Alot of cool facts and real useful information in this colorful little book. My 10 year old read it himself and even my 17 year old learned some things she didn't know while babysitting one night. A great book to have in the home library. Excellent!
2,Hilarious,"Lil Wyte is hilarious, but unintentionally. He reminds me of the ""Icy Hot Stuntas"", who I still am not sure are not an Internet parody. ""Icy White Soljas"" is an instant classic, a tale of his many pairs of Reeboks. (I'm guessing he listened to ""My Adidas"" and ran with the idea, but it's so poorly executed that any comparison would be a farce.) I would recommend buying this album for white, suburban, high-school-aged wannabe gangstas, so you can ridicule them even more. Also, die-hard fans of Vanilla Ice and Snow might really enjoy this album.I will admit the production is decently done, but no amount of studio work could make up for the lack of writing talent and delivery. Unless, of course, you're looking for a gag gift, in which case this would be perfect.2 stars for reminding me of ""Malibu's Most Wanted"" and few laughs."
3,"A fair book, nothing more","MRs. Susasn has written a readable book, but in a naive language, spending much time talking about Gibson personal problems and little about his combat days. There is no sensation that the reader can understand the real hazards of flying night bombing over occupied Europe in WW2."
2,not so safe skating,"the skater couple in this set are not setting a very good example for the young'ins of america, and the canadian provinces. the couple is not wearing any saftey pads. it isn't stable, because my sisters have the same car but from a different set. it breaks all the time. the top breaks off. also the boy in the set, is ugly. whats with the goatee? it makes him look like the devil. seriously, the doll looks too old for its age. this is not a quality toy, so i would suggest getting something else."
3,Breaks easily,"I got this toy for easter one year, and within a day the flower broke that could make the roof go up and down so i ended up getting a new one just because i thought the idea was really cool. But this toy is not very durable."
2,breakable,"This toy has a flip-top roof and it breaks everytime you use the handle. It is very fun, but hard to fix after it breaks. Overall, this toy is not very good."
2,Plenty of gossip; little philosophy,"Well, Strathern is certainly entertaining, if not informative. He gives us the dirt on each philosopher, tells us who was overweight, ... pushed people around, etc. This would be great if we were reading about movie stars or politicians but I bought these books in order to understand something about what these philosophers thought. He does reserve a few pages at the end of each volume to tells us one or two of their ideas and gives us a handful of quotes. A total waste of money unless you hate your philosophy classes so much that you want to hear how awful the personal lives of the philosophers were. A new low in publishing."
2,Biography not Philosophy,I should have been smarter that one can not understand Kant in 90 minutes but even than the name of the book is very misleading. It is a short biography than Philosophy. There are better ways to spend money. Read this book as biography but you do not get bang for your buck. There are much better biography books.
3,An Introduction to life and works of Kant,"Do not expect to learn Kant's philosohy from a fifty page book. As the author will tell you, Kant's first work was over 800 pages long.What you can expect from this book is a short biographical look at the works and life of Kant.I like these little 90 minute books. I have been using them as the openers to expanded study. For example before diving into Kant's writing I decided to get an overview.The ""In 90 minutes"" series has helped me to begin my studies of each philosoher, and in many ways has given me some idea of what to expect.I like these books, but remember, it is an opener to the study of each philosopher, You may not be able to use them as cheat sheets for your homework."
4,How musical performances interact with local social systems,Gregory Barz's MUSIC IN EAST AFRICA introduces readers to the historical and modern musical performances unique to East Africa.Chapters in his MUSIC IN EAST AFRICA select individual musicians working in both traditional and contemporary fusions of sounds.Add eyewitness accounts of performances and descriptions of how musical performances interact with local social systems and you have a blend of music theory and anthropology unique to this series.
2,Barely functional anymore,"Years ago these used to be good. Now it's hard to find one that works properly, you have to get a box of 100 and hope some of them will work well. Why is this? It's become a throw-away society, quality is on the decline. Speedball probably thinks that few will notice the reduction in quality (except for the handful of professionals who are experts on their materials), so why not cut some corners and make more profits?I've been using drawing/inking art supplies for 22 years professionally and I have a hard time getting these to do their job now. Many of my other pro friends say the same thing. I've switched to Deleter's Comic Pen 240, from Japan, and it works as it should."
4,So so....,"My wife loves the CD, it is ok for me...I would say one awesome song, 3-4 ok ones and the others I could do without...but everybody has different taste so it may work for you!"
3,Not the essential Miles Davis,"It is a great album, although there are many Miles Davis's songs there are missing. Such as ""Ah Leu Cha"" which I was hoping to listen.Even though there are titles like ""So What"" and ""'Round Midnight"" that really are 2 of the best Mile's songs ever.It is worthy to have it, but it is NOT the essential. There are other titles that I consider more essential than some of those in this album."
4,One of Kansas' better albums,"There's a little of the inconsistency here you often get with a band's second album- some of the more poppish cuts don't work as well (especially since they sound dated), but some of the band's very best cuts are here. I still prefer this to ""Leftoverture"" and ""Point of Know Return"". Since I came to those albums after hearing the live album, I thought that they suffered by comparison. ""Masque"" doesn't have that problem, since of its best cuts, only ""Icarus"" appears in full version on the live album. And as good a song as that is, it's nice to hear a different version of it. The performances here have more energy than those other two albums, but the songwriting is not as good as on ""Song for America"". The only thing that keeps me from listening to this album more is a kind of depressing tone to it: probably because of the self-pitying ""Two Cents Worth"" and a general dark sound. Still, any fan of Kansas would enjoy and should own this album."
1,Somewhat helpful,"The unit I received is bright yellow plastic but I guess it is the same item. It clearly does NOT kill the flea even if left on the bug for several seconds. It merely stuns them, which slows them down, making it easier for me to catch them and divide them with my fingernail. I cannot understand why it works on some and not mine unless I am plagued with Super-Fleas! But I still use it and am glad I got it."
2,Flea zapper,Noisy and doesn't work well on short haired dogs like min pins. Noisy and doesn't work well on short haired dogs like min pins.
5,Effective,"It's fascinating to see how it works. I have a multicat householdand among my cats is a fluffy-tailed, medium-long haired black cat. When I run the flea zapper through her tail, I often see little sparks pop up as it zaps the fleas. Sometimes a flea gets caught in the teeth of the comb, and a little electric arc will develope for a few seconds. I like the built-in cleaning devices on the comb. I useit in conjunction with other flea medications to keep fleas off in between combings. It comes in very handy, too, when the old medication begins to wear off, but it's not yet time for another dose."
3,flea zapper,I found the zapper would not work on my american bulldog at all because he has short short course hairs; with my two who are calico mix it would stun the fleas but not kill them. not really impressed with the product and would not recommend it to anyone.
1,Worst Product,"This is one of the worst products I have ever bought, perhaps the worst in the world and it wasn't cheap either. I guess Amazon realized that and dropped their price $12 less after I bought it. The review about how you can't even comb with this because of the design is absolutely correct (beads at the end of each tooth), it just makes the thing slide over your dog's hair. Absolutely useless. Save your money, buy anything else but this."
4,Very good goggles,"Bought these goggles to got snow cat skiing in the Selkirks, British Columbia, CA. Overall they worked very well, only once or twice was the fan unable to keep them from fogging up. Both times was after heavy exertion and I was over dressed. My only real knock on these was that the lense material was soft. Fairly easily scratched when cleaning with the cloth bag that came with the goggles."
2,All downhill,"This is not the Chris Crutcher I love to read. Instead of a fictionalized version of the true events in his life concerning the censorship of one his previous books, I would have loved to have read a non-fiction account of that problem. Further, I could not suspend my disbelief going in and out of real and unreal events. The ghost story, the story of the mute protagonist, and the story of censorship seemed like three seperate stories that would have been more provocative if told separately. Where is the Chris Crutcher that wrote ""Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes""?"
3,Censorship theme in a hodgepodge story. But still don't let this dissuade you from reading it.,"This is the first Crutcher book where I haven't been sad at the arrival of the last page. Crutcher came off looking immature in his one-dimensional criticism of the fundamentalist preacher. He made a lame attempt at giving the antagonist some depth far too late in the story. It's like he believes all narrow-minded preachers are harsh because they were abused as children (read his other books and you'll see what I mean). Nevertheless, his insight into the struggles of young adults is on the mark and quite refreshing. I would still recommend every book I've read from this author, even if I don't think he's fair with some of his characterizations. You'll find REAL topics in his writing that are not covered in most teen novels. All the struggles teens (and most adults) hide are vividly brought into the light throughout his narratives. Lost souls will find hope in his books."
3,Interestingly Enough...,"... I did not particuarly enjoy this book. I found it a bit abstract for my taste. A narrator who dies in the first chapter is not exactly appealing to my reading budds. However, I have to give Chris Crutcher props in the fact that he certainly got my entire school interested. This is a book that my entire school had to read, and it was the HOT topic in the halls. Parents were complaining, PTO was rebelling, and kids couldn't stop talking. While most of the discussion was about how weird we found the book, I must say that I have never in my life seen a school get so riled up over 230 pages of text."
2,$L33D!NG H!LL,"What do you do when your dad and your best friend die in the same week? Well thats just what happened to Eddie.This book by Chris Crutcher is an intense, unpredictable, twisting tale about how one kid (Eddie) can take so much. What Eddie doesn't know is that his best friend who died in a total accident, is standing right next to him. I liked how the author switched point of views all the time. It really feels like you're in the book experiencing every little thing that happens."
1,A boring dud,What started out as what I thought was a good idea quickly turned into what read like a spoiled brat spewing venom because of some imagined slight. B O R I N G !!!
3,Self-serving book,The author seemed to be justifying his father and his fantasties about his father were very strange. It would have been more interesting if the author had stuck to the truth.
4,the contributions rcross the speculative fiction spectrum,"This sixteen-story collection shows the vast range of Robert Sheckley's works as the contributions range across the speculative fiction spectrum. Mr. Sheckley seems as comfortable writing in fantasy as much as science fiction, which this reviewer is more familiar with his novels in the latter genre. The well written tales focus on the minds of the key characters (not all human) who face adversity that are often colossal, but also achieving success. However, readers need to also understand that eleven of the tales were in other publications within the last five years with nine of these appearing in the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. Subscribers of that magazine will already know how good Mr. Sheckley's shorts are while much of the rest of us for familiar with his novels and their movie adaptations will appreciate this anthology.Harriet Klausner"
1,Spanx Trouser Socks,There is a bunch of cloth in the toe - I assume for reinforcement - that jams the toe box and the seams aggravate your toes all day.
5,great socks,"Ordered these to wear with my suits for work. They fit great and wear well. I am 5'6"" tall however and they are long enough to extend above my knees by about 2"". Be aware of this if you order."
3,Excellent Analysis of Gender Roles in the Church,A considerate discussion of an oft argued role of women in church life and ministry. Well discussed on both sides of the issue..
5,I love this color,I've been using this for few years and I love it. I have dirk brown hair with lots of gray hair around face. Henna gave me nice highlight.
1,No color change at all,"This henna is of very poor quality, it's gritty, has twigs in it but the worst of all, has no dye release - no change in color was observed at all after 2 hours. I would be wary of premixed hennas - henna and indigo has different dye release times so they need to be mixed separately.Don't waste your time or money. Find good quality henna."
1,Money spent for nothing!,"I have light brown hair with some grey ,not that much. I got this color,because didn't want to become red-haired. It didn't really change my real color,which is rather strange. The worst part is that it didn't cover my grey hair. So,I simply lost the money. I followed the instruction ,and kept it on my hair for about 3 hours. This henna is good for nothing!"
3,Teeney tiney print,If you are of the age which requires you to wear reading glasses think again about buying this book. I would love to read this book but time and time again I read a page and have to put it down because it hurts my eyes. The print is far too tiny and I am looking for another book. Anyone want mine?
5,Diary of St. Faustina,"This book is an excellent one to study in a group. We gather in my home each week and read from this diary and discuss the wonderful insights that it gives. It is a springboard to great discussions. I act as the facilitator, moving the discussion along. The first time we studied it, it took us 2 and 1/2 years to complete. We went on to study other books, but then returned to this Diary to study it a second time because so many wanted to return to it. Other books we studied and gained a great deal from are, ""True Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary"" by St. Louis Marie de Monfort, ""The Imitation of Christ"" by Thomas a Kempis, ""Humility of Heart"", and ""Hungry Souls"" by Gerard J.M.VanDen Aardweg.So consider gathering in your own home to study such works which are sure to benefit your soul!"
5,Important info about our Lord!,This book is very important because it shows by the Lords own words how todeal with and understand about suffering in your mortal life.
5,Divine mercy in my Soul,"This book arrived ahead of time, in perfect condiction.Am very pleased with this transaction. Would recommend thisbookseller to all.Regards,Leo."
5,INCREDIBLE!!!,"This is my favorite book, which says a lot considering how much I read. St. Faustyna's recordings of the words of Christ, as well as her own, will bring you closer to our Lord. Do not hesitate to buy this book!"
3,Book is small,The print in this book is quite small making reading difficult. I would recommend searching for a copy with normal size print.
5,'Your' the 'False Prophet' Mariel!.,"*Sister Faustina 'most certainly' ""could write!"". >*She had her 'pens' ""blessed"" by Jesus!. 'I suggest' you >""Read"" the Diary 'AGAIN' Mariel!.

2,A Prima Games title this is not...,"This book serves the purpose of listing all available moves for the preset roster and shows all available storylines in the game. That's about it. No instruction on Create a Wrestler, or for that matter, create anything. In fact, the previous two items I listed (moves and storylines) are pretty much the only content in this book. I don't know; maybe I'm spoiled by Prima and the good job they do writing for PC games. They just could have included a LOT more content, that's all. You could have found any old FAQ in 30 seconds of search-engine poking."
4,WWE S. vs. Raw 2007 Signature Series Guide,"It was great! Perfect condistion but I did not see the Bradygames Signature on it that was suppose to be on it... That was my only concern; otherwise, it was perfect!"
4,Guide me to a new light...,"This guide is must have if you own SmackDown vs Raw. It has all of the basics, how to create a superstar,and creating titles and PPV's, step by step. It has every superstar in the game featured (except Sable),and their biographies,and info, and their move lists with finishers. The guide explains the Season Mode,the locker room set-up,the differnet modes. Goes through the different Challenged in the Challenge Mode. And includes a chapter on the ShopZone and the items and what they're for. Important articles of every single type of match, the menus EVERYTHING you should know about the game. You just gotta buy this if you want to be successful in playing SmackDown vs Raw!"
4,alright,"not bad, kinda hard to memorize the moves..but once you play it alot prob be no prob. at first i was confused on why my wrestler was not reacting..i guess you need to know the basic buttons before you play so give that pamphlet a look!"
5,You Don't Know Bryan,"Bryan is my high school history teacher of long ago and I would say you can beleive most of the hysterically funny stories found in this book! Why, it's better than a comic book! Read it and I'll bet you can relate to many of the situations."
3,Renewal,I would prefer not to have the auto-renewal feature. It would be nicer to have the option or a reminder of renewal.
2,Not for me!,I purchased this magazine subscription because I was starting to become interested in the wonderful world of Yoga. However it wasn't what I expected. It had a couple of illustrations of yoga poses but I felt that most of the magazine was advertisements and articles that werent worth reading. I would rather look up this information online and save my time and the resources used on this magazine.
2,Be Prepared to Wait,It's now been over six weeks since I ordered Yoga Journal. I've never had to wait this long for a subscription to start. Usually the most recent issue is sent right away and the next issue is sent according to the magazine's schedule. I ordered this as a gift for my wife's birthday but that's long gone. The waiting time is really quite unusual given the publishing technology currently available.
3,Honestly?,"Let me start out that I paid $5 for a one-year subscription to this magazine, that to my understanding will be 6 issues. The cover advertises the stand price as $4.99 an issue, so I'm very please with the price I paid....Reason primarily being that this magazine is two-thirds advertisements! Very nearly every time I turn the page there is one full page of ads and in many cases, the side with content has 1/3 page ad or the occasional 2/3!!!Ohh I enjoy some of the articles, the depth of the yogi mindset seems to be in every one of them. The many pictures are very inspiration with a few lines here and there that I like to write down for inspiration as well. In a nutshell: Depending on the price, I will probably renew. It's a nice read, however halfway through the magazine I'm incredibly annoyed with the amount of advertisements for expensive extras. I will update as the year goes on as to whether the articles are too similar from one month to another."
5,Inspiring,I am always so happy when this arrives in the mail. It's a nice curl-up-and-read-on-the-sofa magazine that is inspiring and relaxing at the same time.
2,A bit confused,"I bought this on 9-14 and still havn't gotten my first issue, when can I expect to start getting them?Would Rate a 5 star because I know this magazine is worth it, which is why I bought it!! Just have yet to see a copy : ("
2,Comercial,"This magazine has been most of time full of not well written article. Too much advertise inside and very repetitive. It needs more creativity and embracement of ahimsa towards the reders. I mean, I can read an article without being attacked by on the hundreds of commercials inside.Which becomes very distractive.I think it should be free at every yoga studio entrance or a very small fee to be delivered at your house."
1,A snail is faster....,I still have not received the yoga magazine that I oredered in March. The estimated delievery date is June 3rd. I don't understand that. I will not be ordering magazines from amazon again!
4,Good and not so good,Generally like the magazine. Just concerned that students new to yoga would read through it and just expect themselves to be able to do what the yogis in the photos are doing. Yoga is not a one-size-fits-all type of practice. Practiced incorrectly injuries CAN and DO happen. I wish that were made more clear to readers.
5,yoga journal,"love it, it has many easy to learn poses and the recipes are great. I look forward to it each month"
2,Too many ads,"This is not a bad magazine, but the focus of it is on ads for products and services to purchase.There really is not enough quality articles on Yoga techniques or equipment or trends to balance out all the advertisement.I bought this magazine as a gift for my sister for 2 years on Auto Renew, she is a Yoga instructor and she told me to stop the subscription as she found it to have very little info of use to her.Really, what more need be said about this publication than that??"
2,Change of heart,Learned that because you start reading a magazine about yoga it doesn't make you anymore interested in taking-up yoga. The cart preceded the horse.
1,Will Review It If It Ever Arrives,"Ordered it and paid for it in full, (two-year subscription) on January 6 as a gift for my wife. It is almost June and it's no deal from Deal Universe."
4,Yoga Journal,Just received my first issue and I think this will be a great resource for my new yoga business. I am very happy with the magazine.
4,A must for yoga teachers,This journal is great. I read it and then pass it along to my students who try the different poses. We also review some of the articles. The only negative is that there are way too may advertisements. But then most magazines are full of ads.
2,my favorite magazine,"Well-written and designed, YJ introduced me to exercises/asanas that cured awful back pain.But each issue is interesting, and gets me to try something new.YJ has improved my health and disposition.Update 7/2012: did not renew after YJ started featuring tattooed models and photos. Tattoos have nothing to do with Yoga."
2,Too female-oriented,Y j used to be more geared to everyone. Now it has a guy's picture on the cover only once in 8 years!
4,Yoga: Never Out Of Style,"Yoga Journal arrives in my mailbox on an erratic schedule, but it's always worth the wait. I value its articles, information, instruction and asana demonstrations. All are presented in the calm and cerebral manner that should typlify true yogic theory and practice.YJ is one of only two magazines I keep on file because its subject is timeless and relevant."
3,Some Memorable Scenes,"This is the only Oz book I've ever read, so, unlike some of the reviewers, I can't compare it to either Baum's or the other authors'. I remember picking up an old tattered hardback from my Grandmothers' shelves when I was about twelve. The book itself wasn't that memorable, and I seem to recall that it ran out of steam by the time the travelers actually reached the Emerald City. Still, I recall reading in facination how Bucky got to Oz (blown through the air by and exploding boiler) and in creepy horror as he and Davy Jones were swept down the underground river and into the kingdom of the gnomes. For these scenes alone. The version I read was also wonderfully illustrated. For these reasons alone, this book has a special place in my heart."
1,great illustrations,"I was 10 yrs. old when I read this book. I gave it a D- at the time, comparing it with the books of Baum and Thompson; these books generally received A's and B's. It appeared to be a book for much younger readers than the earlier Oz books."
5,3rd graders at Everett Elementry School,"Peter gets an assignment from school to write a true and real story about sometime in his life.Grandpa Jack moves from Florida into his grandchildren's house, because his wife died from emphysema.Peter wants Grandpa to move in. Before he finds out his Grandpa is moving into his room because of his arthritis in his leg,forcing Peter upstairs. Peter thinks the only way to get his room back is to go to war with his Grandpa. Read this thrilling exciting book, to find out what happens!"
4,The War With Granpa,"My class and I just got done reading The War With Grandpa. I would realy recommend this book.There are some realy funny jokes, pranks, and lots of other stuff too. I like this book because two kin are fighting, but not with weapons. They are at war with jokes and pranks like taking underwear or even socks,but I don't want to spoil a good story. So now you have a great story to read."
3,The War with Grampa,"My name is Garett.I loved the War With Grampa!I liked it because it's an adventure,and you expect something.My favorite part was when Grampa striked backand did cool and rude things.That was the most surprizing part.The book was also cool because its long enough to read.Its also kinda serios,like when grampa was sad that and he thought Peter woldnt do that.So that is why I like the book.oh yea you have to get the book if you want to know the ending..."
4,The War With Grandpa,"I liked reading The War With Grandpa.It is a fun book to read. I liked it because it was funny,the kid in the book always made his sentences either too long or too short,I would recomend this book to anyone."
5,war with grampaw,war with grampa was funny and was a mystery .Book I thank it was indubtily cool ages 1-122. Itis non-violent.
4,The War with Grandpa,The War with Grandpa was a good book. I liked how Peter tricked grandpa and Grandpa tricked Peter. My favorite trick aginst peter was when Grandpa took and hid Peter's things. My favorite trick aginst grandpa was when Peter took Grandpa's flase teeth. Well I can't tell you any more or the story wouldn't be exciting when you read it.
5,My Review,The title of the book is The War with Grandpa. The author is Robert Kimmel Smith. The illustrator is Richard Lauter. Peter's grandpa took his room and Peter wants it back. It's a really good book because it's interesting. My favorite part is the whole book.I would recommend this book to a friend because they would like it.
4,War With Grandpa,This wonderful book is about Peter and his nice Grandpa Jack. He starts a war with his Grandpa. When he moved from Florida he had taken his room. Peter wanted his room back. So when they started the war Peter's first attack was taking Grandpa's slippers. His Grandpa went to his unwonderful room and got his slippers back. grandpa's first attack was tacking Peter's Monopoly pieces. He wrote a letter that said:Two people can play at this game. But you can't play this game now. Signed by the old man.
4,Read It!,"This was a great book! Grandpa moves in with Peter's family and takes over Pete's room. Peter seeks revenge day after day to make Grandpa want to move out: however, Grandpa strikes back. Every chapter is a new,funny adventure!"
2,Not that Great,I would give this book a two because I didn't really like it. The boy gets in a fight with Grandpa and that's about all they did.Review by Zach
4,The War With Grandpa,"Everything was going fine in Peter Stokes' life until he found out his grandpa was moving in and taking his room. Once Peter's grandpa took his room the war was started. Now Peter has to go upstairs to an ugly room. Peter can't stand living upstairs so he comes up with a plan. Peter writes a note declaring war. Peter kept on writing notes to grandpa but grandpa ignored the notes. Peter plans a trick and grandpa pulls a big trick back. Who do you think will win the war?This was the best book that we ever read because you never knew what Peter or Grandpa was going to do next. Also we thought their attacks were great, especially Grandpa's attacks. For example, we liked when Grandpa did all of the attacks in one morning making Peter late for school. We were surprised when Peter ended up losing the war. The war stopped because Peter and Grandpa came up with a solution."
5,War With Granpa,"War With Grandpa is a very good book. It's about a young boy who hates when his grandpa comes and visits him. His grandpa does come and visit, and his grandpa has to sleep in his room. He and his grandpa always get in arguements. When he and his grandpa got in a huge arguement he ran away. The ending is a shocker. I suggest that you would read this wonderful and thrilling book because if you don't like taking a couple of weeks to read one book this is the couple of days kind of book. I rated this book the best one of all the books I have ever read. I can almost can guarantee that you will enjoy this book. I know I did!"
1,ThE wAr WiTh GrAnDpA rEvIeW,My favorite part was when Peter steals Grandpa's false teeth. I liked that part because it would be very funny. My least favorite part is when Peter refused to burn Grandpa's underwear. If I was Peter it would have been the first thing I would have done to him. I thought that the whole book was very boring. I almost fell asleep!! That is why I rated the book as 1 star.
2,War!,"I think this book is a great for kid our age . In the begining the book is all serious , but towrards the middle it was getting funnier. who would have thought Peter's family a apartment in thier basement for grandpa.I like the part when Peter had to go on a tresure hunt for his clothes allover the house .I would recommend this book to any person because it's like a journal. This is a great book."
2,Ben's Essay,"I liked this book, but it wasn't my favorite book. I think that Robert Kimmel Smith could have added more detail to make the book more catchy to readers. It's kind of dull in some of the chapters, but in some of the chapters it was okay. Like I said, I wouldn't rate it very high, but I wouldn't rate it very low either. I'd say it's about average for the books out there. i think some of the chapters could have been left out of the book, but I like how he fit the chapters together. I would recommend this book to another class, but like I said, It's not my kind of book."
3,THE WAR WITH GRANDPA REVIEW,"I THOUGHT THE WAR WITH GRANDPA WAS A BAD BOOK.THIS BOOK IS THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ,BECAUSE IT'S BORING. PETERS HAVING A WAR WITH HIS GRANDPA HOW REAL IS THAT.IT'S BORING BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY ACTION, LIKE THE PART WHEN PETER TOOK GRANDPAS SLIPPERS.SIGNED, COREY"
3,The War Begins,I thought this was a good book. It's about a boy named Peter who goes to war with his Grandpa because Peter's parents gave Grandpa Peter's room. I thought it was a very funny and entertaining story. People who like funny books with good endings will like this book. I like this book because it was very funny. I hope you like the book as much as I did.By J.L.
5,The War With Grandpa,My name is Amberley and I think that The War With Grandpa is a great book . It's a book about a boy named Peter and his grandpa in a war . Peter started the war because his grandpa is staying in his old room which Peter had spent his whole life in .With a little help from Peter's friends he is willing to fight for his room and start garilla warfare.
4,The War With Grandpa,This book was a good book.Peter's Grandpa moves in Peter's room. Peter is not happy. So he wants to get his room back.Peter thinks his Grandpa stole his room.So Peter decides to go have war.I can't tell you any more things about the story so you will have to read the book to find out.
4,war with grandpa,"My name is Shannon,War with grandpa was a great book. I thought it was a good book because, it had a lot of action, details, and ti was just plane funny. My favorit part of the book was when Gandpa started to get in the game.Also when Grandpa "" droped the other shoe on Peter."""
5,The War With Gradpa,CalliI think this book is fatastic and great . Iliked how funny itwas andthe exciting triks and pranks they did on each other.Theres nothing I dont like.You have to check this book out.
4,The war game comeding,Peters grampa moves in his room! And he is not going to give up his room.And the war starts.Grampa and Peter steel each others stuff and do pranks on each other. But Peter gives up and grampa gives Peters room back and he fixxes the basement and moves there.
3,I liked your book.,I thought it was funny when Peter had to find all of his thngs for school. I also liked how you wrote small chapters.My favorite character was grandpa!
1,An extremily stupid book,"I'm sorry, but this book is not in my hall of fame for books in the categories of origanal thinking, good plot, or any thing else you could think of that makes a book good. In 4th grade we were forced to read that horrid book. I shall never read it again, and if I see it, theres a good chance that no one would ever see that book again, exept as a ""stripped book"", as they say inside the covers."
1,A Horrible Book,"This book was one of the worst books I've ever read. What happens in it is basically Peter's grandpa comes to live with the family, but he has to take Peter's room. With that, Peter decides to go to ""war"", like you can call it that. I mean, all they do is play tricks on each other THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE WHOLE BOOK!!!!If you own this book, I suggest you sell it on eBay, or burn it in the fire. If you like this book, you don't know true classics and you need to read one of those classics.Don't EVER, EVER, EVER get this book."
5,War With Grandpa,"I liked war with grandpa because it was funny. The funny part was when Grandpa took Peter's underwear and socks. Another funny part was when Grandpa woke up with his hair all crazy and wild. It also reminded me to take care of my family. Sorry but if I tell you the story, it won't be a surprise to anyone who reads this."
5,The War With Grandpa,"I just read a great book called The War With Granpa.It was a really funny story.Tere are some amazing tricks that they play on each other.Now all you have to do is read it.I'll bet you'll a great time just like I did.There are also some really funny characters too.That's why you should read this book.It has such a good ending,but I can't tell you or it will ruin the whole thing for you."
3,The War With Grandpa,"I think you should read The War With Grandpa because it is a really good book. All the other kids like to read this book, and some adults like to read it too. I like to read this book a lot, and I mean a lot! I don't really like to read the book but I have to do it for my class work. There was a time in the book that Grandpa did a big joke on Peter. He put all of Peter's underwear in the shelf and put all of Peter's socks in the restroom under the sink. Then he put Peter's shirts inside out. Then he put Peter's pants inside out and put Peter's shoelaces on the kitchen counter. When Peter got to school, he forgot his lunch."
5,The War With Grandpa,"If you read this book you know it's a good book,if you haven't well it is a good book. Here's a hint if you haven't read it.It's about a young boy named Peter who's very mad at his grandpa because he stole his room. Well that's all I can tell you for now.... maybe I can tell a little more about the story. Peter has a little sister named Jenny, she loves horses, but not the best at keeping secrets. Grandpa is retired & moved in with Peter from Florida NOW, that's all I can tell you.You'll have to read the book."
5,The War With Grandpa,"The War With Grandpa is wonderful.I liked the book because Peter just found out that Grandpa was moving in with his family.Peter heard that he had to move out of his bedroom.Second I like it because they having a war.It was cool and it was funny,too.When Peter does his last attack it is so funny. The cool part is when Peter forgets his lunch.If I tell you any more you won`t love it.It was a great book."
3,The War With Grandpa,I liked this book because it was funny. Peter has to give up his room . Grandpa and Peter get in a war . What will Peter do ? Peter plays a trick on grandpa . Then grandpa plays a trick . Grandpa then plays a big trick . Last Peter plays his last trick . They find out how to get their own rooms . I injoyed this book because it was funny . I think you'll injoy it to . Don't waste time get the book and read it .
3,The War With Grandpa,I think this book was ok because it was prety good. You might think this is an interesting book. Grandpa moved into Peters room and Peter got into a war with his Grandpa. Peter and Grandpa played tricks on each other. Grandpa and Peter went on a trip. At the end of the book Grandpa and Peter were... I don't want to give it away. You should buy this book.
4,The War With Grandpa,"I liked this book because it was funny. This book is about a boy and his grandpa. The boy, Peter, gets moved out of his room to the guest room, and his grandpa moves into his old room. Peter plays a nasty trick on his grandpa by setting his Grandpa's alarm clock to wake him up in the middle of the night."
4,an awsome book,War With Grandpa is an awsome book. It is about Peter Stocks and his grandpa go to war when grandpa take his room .You would like it if you like funny books. My favirot partis when granpa did his last move.
3,War with grandpa,It was ok becas it never made sense to me I thank the best part was wen grandpa lade that drty treck I give it 3 stars.
4,War with grandpa,This book is a little cool. grandpa moves in and has to live in peters room. they have a war. peter loses the war. it is a very good book
2,The War With Grandpa,"I rate this book 2.5 because I think that the author shouldn't have made the ending the way it ended. The book is about a boy named Peter. He loves his room. When he hears the news that his grandpa is coming he is happy, but when he looks into it he finds out that grandpa is taking his room... he starts a war. I would recommend this book if you do not like your grandpa (it might give you some ideas!). Age-wise, I would say this is for kids ages 8-10 years old. It's a comedy.~N64 NDS"
4,This was a good book,"This was a good book we got sucked into it. We read this book with our forth grade class. I thought that our teacher picked out a very exciting book. This book was about a war with Grandpa. It showed a lot of detailed and descriptive phrases, which made us, want to read more.-Alyson, Rachel, and Brittany (...)"
3,The War With Grandpa,I think that it was ok but it was a long book.I like the part were Peter took grandpas teeth.I think that girls would like it best.
2,WarWithGrandpa,I dont like this book very much becaus it dident have enoughexcitment.And the words are easy to read.One part of the storyI liked was when they caught a whole bunch of flounder.
3,The War With Grandpa,"I like this book because it is funny and I also like playing harmless tricks on people. This book is really not my type of book. I like adventures, mystery and Detective like books. But I recommend this book to other people who like tricky type books.Halle"
5,The War With Grandpa,My name is Dylan.I especially liked when Peter got slapped.I also liked when they stole stuff from each other.I didn't like when the book was over.You should read this book!
4,the war with grandpa,"In our third and fourth grade class we read The War With Grandpa in groups of four and five. We think the war should have been longer and more attacks should have happened. We liked that the book was funny and not sad. We also liked the part when Steve said ""Burn his underwear."" We liked that Grandpa was in World War ll. We liked it when they went fishing. We liked that Peter got his room back. We liked when Peter stole his teeth and Grandpa had to cover his mouth to talk. Peter should have done more tricks because Grandpa did a lot of tricks to him."
4,The War With Grandpa,"I think The War With Grandpa is a great book to read. It isfunny, loving, caring, and mean. Grandpa and Peter are having asecret war that his parents and sister do not know about. Grandpa and Peter plan major attcks on each other, like taking each other's things and hiding them. Read to find out why they are having a secret war. Jenny is Peter's sister and is the one who tells Peter the news that Grandpa is coming. Grandpa is coming to live with them because Grandma died. Grandpa was a construction worker. He had to retire because a large piece of wood fell on his leg. Read to find out if Peter and Grandpa can find a peaceful solution to their war! I rate this book 4 stars.by Matt M."
4,"If you sit in a chair too much, you could use this!","I am in good shape and excercise. When I complained about back, hip pain and general malaise from sitting at my desk too much I watched this DVD at the suggestion of a friend. I must say that after watching this DVD, in some time, I found myself doing the exersices at my desk and that it helps me keep my body and mind better adjusted. I feel better. The moves really become a subconscious act as your body wants what you do here. Beats the **** out of a chiroprator."
4,Real and Satisfying Exercise,"When surgery left me spending much of my time in a wheel chair, I was concerned to find some means of exercise that would keep me in reasonable physical shape. I formerly did T'ai Chi, so it was with interest that I discovered the existence of this videotape. But I had reservations, too; could a seated T'ai Chi form replicate the many benefits of the original thing?So far, although I have used the video for a limited period of time, I am convinced that it provides a good T'ai Chi experience, and real and satisfying exercise. The motions I went through with the instructor were the motions I remembered so well. Even with my limitations I was able to do most of them, and the tape left me with a pleasantly raised pulse rate and a desire to continue using it on an everyday basis. I recommend it highly."
4,tai chi at your desk or on the plane,"I must admit, I was initially skeptical about the possibilities of tai chi chair. However, having practiced the exercises I now do them at my desk or sometimes even while sitting on the couch watching TV. As an IT analyst I spend quite a lot of time sitting in front of a computer, and the exercises really seem to help me(Ive had both CTS and a compressed nerve in my elbow in the past). I also put it to use while stuck for hours on a plane (on the ground!)last Christmas. I find nothing more aggravating than being stuck on a plane (or in traffic). Finding myself about ready to ""flip"", I instead practiced the exercises. This not only calmed me down, but, when we finally did reach our destination I was not all burned out like I am when I usually fly cross country. I definitely recommend Tai Chi Chair."
1,Disappointing in the Extreme,"SAVE YOUR MONEY. This video has very poor quality. There is way too much text printed on dark backgrounds making it virtually unreadable. When the instructor shows the movements she is in the shadow of trees so you can't see what she's doing. In the background is the noise of a babbling brook. Suppposedly this is to be calming. In reality is is annoying as all get out since it's hard to hear what is being said. Later in the video are charts showing a body with written material telling you things to do, but it's impossible to read. I am extremely disappointed and this thing deserves no stars at all."
1,Not the right item,If you are expecting a 30 Pin DVI M1 converter for your InFocus Machine this is not it dispite the picture. I have provided pictures of what was sent! Obviously not the same as the picture posted. When I tried to get someone to just replace it with the right item I was told them could not do that and I would have to order it again! One problem with Amazon is there is really no way to notify a company that they are shipping the wrong items out. Went with another company instead!
3,Useful item,This little item was just what I needed to connect my dvi cord to my projector. It was priced great and I received it very quickly.
3,Border Spice - OK,"I ran across this while looking for ""Fandango"" by Frank Corrales and the Sons of Cisco. It's good and I enjoyed it, but it didn't strike me as being as good or well put together as ""Fandango"" & ""Cantina Classics""."
4,Still the best,"Anybody who grew up watching Thunderbirds, as I did, will welcome the chance to see this movie version, which runs to 89 mins. The start is as we all remember, the marvellous music by Barry Gray, with slightly amended opening credits. The picture quality is pretty good and of course this being a Cinema release its in full widescreen 2.35:1 ratio (although originally even wider apparently), which is much better than the 4:3 of the TV series.The story is typical Thunderbirds material stretched out to make it into a movie length film. This its one failing. The elaborate launch of the zero-x occurs twice in the film, the first time is interesting as the models and ingenuity are fabulous, but the second time through I just felt this was filler and could have been cut considerably. However this is a minor quibble.The commentary is very good, making this an essential purchase for anybody interested Thunderbirds or Gerry Anderson in general."
4,Restricting thunderwear,"IR to the aid of the world alliance aircraft again!The marionettes leave a lasting impression in this far fetched plot about Martian attacks and rocketships colliding to the earth.Magnificent preformance by Cliff Richard (Jr.) and the Shadows with their instruments ""are really [far] out."" Alan gets to dream and save the day, but the roles of the other boys are minimal.Great to add to any sci-fi collection and a must for gerry anderson fans.FAB"
3,Phamplet parading as a book,"This so-called book is more of a phamplet that doesn't focus on it's title, the need to pamper pregnant wives. It's more of a general book for pregnant husbands, in a super-condensed form. You can read this book in its entirity in one evening."
2,I agreed with my husband on this one!,"We don't always agree, but when he was reading this he told me how useless he thought it was. I was off sick one day and decided to read it myself. It was very simplistic and didn't contain any substantive advice. Unless you count aromatherapy suggestions and repeated advice that it's ok to have sex while your pregnant."
1,Grill Care Co. Smoker Temp Gauge,"You get what you pay for.Feels and looks heavy-duty, but came out of the box reading 100*F, and is at least 35*F off when taken to 200*.Horrible. Pay more and be satisfied."
3,Too Many Ballads,"Sorry, when I hear a Latin-American artist, my expectations are always that I'll buy an album which gets me shaking. The fantastic first single I Need To Know raised high hopes in me & alone motivated me to buy this album. The rest of the album isn't bad by any stretch, but does go the Julio Iglesias route which bores me in the end. I should have done my homework a bit more, but hey I love the first single. I also dig the Tina Arena ballad from The Mask of Zorro movie - now that IS something else. Celine Dion would be jealous. I never forgave Jennifer Lopez for the ballad No Ames on her debut album. Its presence here might be for increased album sale but doesn't get my vote as a quality measure. I realise I sound critical. I'm just disappointed in the overall content of the album, yet I can listen to most of the songs - but not the album the whole way through"
1,Sucked in ....,"Well, I should've read the reviews before I bought. It would seem that people either love or hate this album ... and I'm afraid I'm in the latter camp. I was very disappointed to find that 'Need to Know', which gets my hips swaying every time I hear it on the radio, was completely unrepresentative of this dull, soppy, middle-of-the-road collection of forgettable songs. Banal lyrics, whiny voice ... perfect Iglesias material (father or son!) It gets one star only because I quite like 'You sang to me' too ... mostly because he sounds a bit like Alison Moyet on this track!"
2,Boring,"I was shocked to get this CD and realize that ""Need to Know"" was an anomaly on this otherwise boring and sappy selection of songs. His passionate voice in combination with these vapid lyrics is extremely unfortunate. I don't question his talent, just this collection of mush. This is NOT Latin music and I feel duped."
2,?,"I don't understand the craze. I feel this is not the Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, Selena category. I am referring to the English end of it, I cannot comment on the other end of where he is crossing over from. I think you have to be Spanish to appreciate the man and his music. Good luck to him anyway."
4,The Voice!!!!!!!!!!,"The voice on this man is incredible. I enjoy the latin soul renditions. I have seen this man in person and that voice, is unbelieveable. But his voice is lost on the big number productions like ""No One"". When it is just him and the traditional latin groove in combination with r&b, hip-hop and soul you have a winner. THE SALSA SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. Like track number 8 ""That's Okay"". MARC ""DID NOT FORGET HIS ROOTS"" and it is evident. Michael Bolton wishes he could keep company with ""Our 90's version SALSERO"". I know he is our next ""HECTOR LAVOE"""
5,This is just a great CD .......,"This CD has 15 songs that you want to hear over and over and over..... I like all the ballads, but ""My baby you"" and ""You sang to me"" are great song that I hope will make the charts. ""I need to Know"", ""That's Okay"", and ""She's Been Good to Me"" get you dancing right away. If you love good music, you have to buy this CD. You will really enjoy it."
3,"Good, Not Great","I hate to say this, because Im a huge Marc fan, but this CD doesn't live up to his salsa music. It is a good CD, though, but a lot of the songs sound the same, and keep to the same topic. And is it just me, or does his voice sound different? Here's to his nxt salsa CD."
4,A truly romantic and passionate CD.,"I have listened to Marc Anthony since the release of his first CD, which was a few years ago. To this day they are still my favorite CDs and I listen to them constantly. His voice is remarkably filled with passion in the song titled My Baby You. This CD has many song tracks which are sure to be hits (such as Am I the only one,My Baby you, You sang to me and Don't leave me...which is one of my favorites). I applaud Marc Anthony for putting together a great album."
3,Marc Crosses Over,"Hmmmmm, Marc Anthony is one of my favorite performers. He reminds me of a young Frank Sinatra. His phrasing, his facial features, his pureness of tone. I must admit,the mixing could have been done better. His voice should be more out there, above the music.His passion still rings out from every song...especially ""I Need To Know"". But,I enjoyed that cut off a CD I have with mixed party tracks. All of it could be a tad more Latin & pumped up a bit.All in all, worth the buy.if you find my comments interesting, please click the ""yes""--thanks--CDS"
5,Inspiring Marc Anthony!,"I have to say that for this being Marc's first English CD he has done a wonderful job. I have not heard such great music in a very long time. This CD is a wonderful mix of Salsa as well as ballads, Marc Anthony to me is a man that sings from the heart and can truly express himself in a beautiful way. In my opinion ""MY BABY YOU"" is a the best song in this album, it shows his great love and devotion for his daughter, Arianna. Marc you are great at what you do! Thanks for putting the LATINO name high."
5,Gorgeous voice,"Am a true blue...dyed in the wool country fan {nearly all my 72 years.} also love Latin music. Marc Anthony's wonderful music just soars...his voice is melodic and heartfelt. First heard ""You Sing To Me"" on the car radio and knew I had to buy the CD. Now I'm looking for more of his music...past and future !"
4,Sofisticated Latin Pleasures,Beautiful albumn. Has a special jazzy quality to it. Every song is a delight. I enjoy a variety of types of music - from classical to R&B to county and Latin.Two of my sisters heard my cd and went out and bought one for themselves. Not one song is a waste of time.
4,greatvoice,I heard Mac Anthony and I justlove his singing. I am a great fan of Engelbert Humperdinckand I think Marc Athony is a close competitor.
2,"Loved all the Spanish CDs, this one is blah","Sorry, I just can't get excited about any of these songs. I have all of his other CDs, Contra la Corriente, Otra Nota, Todo a Su Tiempo, and love them all. But most of these cross-over songs sound just the same as any other boring soft-rock drivel. My suggestion, buy the Desde Un Principio/From The Beginning collection."
2,What an overproduced waste of a great talent,"The salsa-influenced songs are great, but most of the album consists of saccharine lite pop ballads. What a sell-out. Don't buy this album, instead buy either of Marc Anthony's previous two albums, Todo a Su Tiempo or Contra La Corriente, they're both irresistable -- the kind of music you can play again and again."
3,I was expecting more salsa!,"The CD is great if you like the pop style that Ricky martin has been succesful with, but I was definately expecting Marc to put a little more of what he is famous for into this album, Salsa. There is really only one song with a Salsa beat incorporated. Could have been a lot better."
4,Romance=Marc Anthony,"I was not sure whether to write a review about Marc Anthony's album,as there are many. But, I could not stand here and not tell people how great ballads are included in his first self-titled English album. I especially find the songs: ""Love is all"", ""My baby you"", ""How could I"" VERY succesfull; and I believe this album will sell more millions of copies, when these songs are published as his next singles, one by one. There is no reason for him to not become the prince of romance with such lyrics, music and pure voice."
3,Not as good as earlier recordings,"I prefer Marc Anthony's upbeat ""Contra la Corriente"" than this collection of predominantly ballads. Although he still has an amazing voice and the ability to portray incredible emotion in his voice, I just didn't find this as enjoyable as his earlier releases."
4,Fabulous,"If you are the type of person who enjoys experiencing various emotions when listening to an album, Marc Anthony's latest is for you. His soulfull beats will make you want to dance, cry and reflect on your own life. Once you've enjoyed this one, go back and buy the first few."
1,"I love Marc Anthony, but this is terrible!!","I was so happy when I finally received my CD in the mail. To my dismay, after listening to it, it was TERRIBLE! I adore Marc Anthony and have his last spanish CD (which is fantastic!). I hope he tries again, and this time, not make it so ""white"" and boring."
2,Ay Bendito!,"Ay Bendito! que te paso mi'jo? El mejor de los artistas con esas cosas! (you know better.... you, all, know what I mean!) y no es porque no me guste la salsa en ingles (recordemos a Tito Nieves). Enough!."
1,Predictable,Marc Anthony has a alright voice but aside from I need to know this is standard run of the mill material.nothing that hasn't been done a Million times already.formula pop.
1,...,"I hate this whole latin music explosion.... Marc Anthony's music is faceless... I know it may not be the best way to judge an artist, but I tend to listen to the artist's voice first, before anything... and I HATE marc anthony's voice.... every song I've heard by him I hate... So far the only Latin artist I like is Carlos Santana.... Santana is a legend... Marc is not.... Try again, Marc.... ... And Enrique Iglesias is not even a singer you should want to imitate. If you started playing your OWN INSTRUMENTS and writing GOOD BALLADS like ""Let It Be"" or ""Hey Jude"" maybe I'd find your music halfway interesting.. (But alas the Beatles would be disgraced....) ..."
3,Fun but no substance,Marc Anthonys first english album is fun with a lot of catchy songs but loses something in the translation. His salsa albums and songs have a certain yearning that is missing but still a great cd to dance along too!
5,marc anthony ''best musician ever'',hi i think this c.d. is awsome marc is not only the hottest guy around his music is the hottest around!!marc is in my oppinion is the best in the music industries.his music is so heart filled and he works hard .it is physically impossible to listen to his music and be sitting down.your always dancing wile listening to his music.and if you dont your listening to the wrong guy.AND THIS C.D. IS SO HEART FILLED YOU COULD HEAR IT IN HIS VOICE AND I LOVE HIM FOR THAT!!any way id just like to tell marc to ''KEEP UP YOUR HARD WORK YOU STILL HAVE ALOT TO ACCOMPLISH IN YOUR LIFE TIME''
5,What a voice!,"Marc Anthony can SING. He's able to put this extra emotional touch in his songs. Although I didn't like every single song on this CD (some were way too syrupy), the way he sings the bad ones more than makes up for their deficiency. I'm a new fan of his. I know he has done many salsa albums already and has a devoted fan base. I know this because I just saw Marc Anthony in concert in Chicago last night. It was FABULOUS! His live singing sounded just like the CD. No electronic tinkering needed with his voice. The fans went wild. It was non-stop screaming for 2 hours...and no these weren't grade school kids."
3,A bit disappointing,"Why I like the song ""Need to know"" and ""You sang to me"" the rest of the album, I could care less about. I found his style varied too greatly and I'm only going to ever play the two I like. I hate it when this happens."
4,You need to know &hear this album,"I have been a fan of Marc Anthony for some time. He sings with such passion. Anyone who loves soulful music should definitely hear this. Songs like ""You Sang To Me""& ""That's OK"" showcase his remarkable vocal talents."
1,don't remember buying it,I don't remember buying this cd.So i should not rate this.But for some of you you may like it.I guess you could check it out.
3,Michael Bolton with a Latin twist.,"I really like the quality of his voice and his ability to make the listener feel what he wants them to. Unfortunately, the choice of songs left me cold. There seems to be very little actual content in the songs. The lyrics themselves make me angry, and there seems to be no one theme to the cd.In this album, he reminds me of Michael Bolton with a Latin twist. If he comes out with a cd with some real content, i would be delighted to buy it."
3,Wanted more dance music,I've been looking forward to this album all summer. Now I'm looking for recommendations on Marc's salsa albums. This one has only 5 songs I love (if you count both English & Spanish versions of 'I need to know' and 'She's Been Good to Me') but the rest wastes his wonderful voice on easy listening ballads.
5,best latin singer of all times,"MARC ANTHONY CD IS THE BEST YET.I LOVE HIS MUSIC AND THIS CD WAS THE GREATEST YET. I NEED TO KNOW I LISTEN TO THIS CD OVER AND OVER AGAIN ,I HAVE COLLECTED ALL HIS MUSIC AND CANT WAIT TO SEE HIM IN CONCERT IN JULY.HES THE BEST .WE LOVE YOU MARC ANTHONY."
3,"Great selection, Lousy Recording","Marc Anthony's voice is great, the rhythmn of the music is great, but whoever was responsible for collaborating the music with the voice did a very poor job. At times you have to be stretching your ears to hear Anthony's sexy, mellow voice. The musice tends to drown his voice, even his back-up singers are more audible than he is. It's as if he was on one continent with an ampliphier trying to reach the rest of his band on another continent. Did they listen to this cd before releasing it? I hope they re-do it with all the same pieces but with a better mixture of voice to instruments."
5,Outstanding.,"This has to be my CD of the last few years. It is beautifully written and produced and every single song is wonderful. Great words, great melodies, catchy beats... I have listened to it over and over again and love it to bits. I have recommended it to everyone I know and I have yet to hear a weak review. Buy it, buy it, buy it..."
2,"Great voice...colorless, banal songs.","I can't remember hearing another recording where the songs fell so far below the ability of the singer. Marc Anthony is a truly gifted singer with an amazing vocal and emotional range. Why he chose these songs (and these producers) to work with is beyond my comprehension. If you compare this recording to his earlier work (and even the songs from Paul Simon's ""Capeman"") you'll see what a drastic difference good material makes. With all the talented songwriters working today(as well as all those from past!), couldn't they have selected something other than this soupy, sugary, meaningless drivel? Come on Marc, give us some substance along with your great voice!"
2,Good Singer/Bad Songs,"I love, love, love, love Marc Anthony; he is one of my favorite Latino singers, and I have followed him from the beginning of his career. If you want his best work, buy his spanish albums -- Amazon has all of them (kudos). He somehow loses the passion and energy on this album. If you like latin-influenced pop music, watered down for an American audience that is too narrow minded to listen to lyrics in other languages, then you will like this album and the other ""latin craze"" music (Martin, Iglesias, Lopez). Latin music has been around forever; it is a shame that Americans think it is now ""the rage"" because a few English albums with latin beats have been released. In other countries, the music scene is much more international..."
2,what a waste!,"Based on the single that came from this album, you would think they figured it out. What the public wants is music that moves with a latin beat. Isn't that why they released ""I need to know"" as the single? I have been listening to Marc for some time and his spanish-language stuff is great, so I was sooooo disappointed to find this CD mostly populated with easy listening sappy ballads. Music to fall asleep buy IS NOT why I buy Marc!"
2,What happened?,"I bought this CD based on the two songs I heard Marc Anthony perform on Saturday Night Live (That's Okay and I Need to Know). His performance was so sizzling that I ignored my initial misgivings of purchasing another watered-down ""crossover"" album. How disappointing. The CD is weighed down with so many boring ballads that it's necessary to skip around to get to anything lively and interesting. Latin music doesn't have to be diluted tp Michael Boltonesque drivel to appeal to a wider audience."
4,1 OF THE BEST SINGERS,"Marc Anthony popped up in 1999 after a year that was filled with not only several other Latin artists emerging but also a year where many of the songs had hints of Latin beats and sounds in them. This was definitely the ideal year for Marc to come out as an English Latin singer.Listening to the CD for the first time, I was greatly impressed by Marc's range and even soul to his voice. He is not only one of the best Latin singers but one of the best singers of all time. If anyone likes how well Patti LaBelle, Mariah Carey or Michael Bolton tears a song up, then get a listen to this singer. Some of the standouts on this disc are WHEN I DREAM AT NIGHT, I NEED TO KNOW, YOU SANG TO ME, MY BABY YOU, NO ONE, LOVE IS ALL and THAT'S OK. Though there are few uptempos, there really is no problem b/c Marc truly knows how to work the ballads. Buy the CD jus so u can be hooked to this incredible singer."
5,Magnificent!,"Excellent album filled with beautiful ballads. Track #9 ""Don't Let Me Leave"" really showcases his incredible vocal talent. I definately recommend this album to anyone who loves quality slow ballads with the R&B touch."
2,Not the best in latin music....,"I was extremely disapointed when, after receiving this CD for Christmas, I popped it into the player and heard what sounded like a cast recording for some obscure off-off-broadway musical. Many of the songs are melodramatic little songs, but none hold the appeal (or my attention) like his first single *I Need to Know.* If you're looking for a good latin singer, with consitently good music, bypass this one. I'f you're looking for a Frank Sinatra knock-off, go for it."
3,Caution,"Just a caution on purchasing these strings. The photo of the product shows a five string banjo, but these strings are for a four string banjo. Nowhere in the discription does it say this is a set of four strings. There is a number 4 in the lower right side of the photo, but my screen resolution is not good enough to see what that means. To be honest I didn't even notice the 4 until I recieved the product. I ordered entirely on the image of the banjo.I would rather not rate this at all but I have to to be able to post this message. So, because the discription was not clear I am giving it a three star rating and considering it about an average grade, hoping it won't warp any ratings averages."
2,Not so wonderful,I thought this would be wonderful to keep the wipes warm so as not to shock the bottom of my son at diaper changes. I was mistaken however. The wipes we either dry or soaking wet and never really that warm. Not worth your money if you ask me.
3,Lid broke after few uses,"After the first week of use, the lid broke off. I still use it though because I like the warm wipes. I have also found that the wipes won't stay up to come through the hole and you have to keep opening the whole thing up, then the lid falls off. If you get this item beware of THE LID. Treat it gently, or try another product."
4,A good warmer,"I think this is a good warmer, but too big. It's on the changing table,(and that takes up a lot of room). I have not had any problems with the lid. If you just add some water to the wipes it will help alot with keeping them warmer! And I think everyone should get some kind of Wipee Warmer so their baby doesn't have to have cold wipes put on him!"
2,Not the best kinda warmer,"we purchased this wipe warmer when my baby was newly born, because she screamed when we had to use those cold wipes:(This wipe warmer is good, but not great.My baby likes the warm wipes, but I have to change the diaper quickly!! It warms up the wipes, but when you take the wipees out they get cold quickly. Another thing that I don't like is it does not have a latch so you can attach it to the changing table. I don't have any other place to put it, so it's close enough when I need it, so it is on the changing table,(which takes up alot of room). And you can't take the wipes out of the hole, you have to open the whole thing to get them out."
4,Good buy,"I got this wipe warmer as a gift and love it! The only problem with it is if you leave the top open, the wipes get freezing!! Other then that, the warmer is great! The top features a dispenser, but the wipes that I buy don't dispense through the top, that's why the top is frequently left open. Good buy for the price!"
3,wipe warmer - nice in winter,I have only used the pull up wipes in this so far. The hole is so big that sometimes the wipes fall back in. If they don't fall in they dry up. Pouring water in it works well. Just be carefull not to put too much water in it. (The wipes stick together and you will pull out 3 or more at a time and they are saturated.) This is the only warmer I have ever used. I like that they don't dry up easily (if kept inside with lid closed). I also haven't had them turn brown or burn. After using the warmer about two weeks the lid broke. I am glad that I didn't buy it. I wouldn't spend the money (someone else did). I'd rather buy other neccesary items that would last longer.
2,mine broke!!!,"I bought 2 of these, one for upstairs, and one for downstairs in my home. The top lid broke on both of them. I would not recommend this product. Look for one a little more sturdy than this!!!!"
3,just add water,"To keep the wipes from drying out, you can just add a little water in the bottom. This will also keep the bottom from burning in any wipe warmer, although i have not had that particular problem with this one."
4,Doesn't burn or dry out wipes,"After reading various reviews and feeling like all the of 'warmers' must dry out or burn wipes, I settled for the fact that it would happen to me and just bought one. Luckily, after 11 months I have had no problem with wipes drying out or burning to the bottom. I would, however, state that the lid does not stay on, but I have found it fairly easy to put back with one hand, now that I know the right side is the side that comes unhinged, and that is well worth it to avoid a crying screaming baby during diaper changing."
3,"OK, but...","After not using a wipe warmer for the first couple of weeks and getting to listen to the blood curdling scream emitted every time the too-cold wipe hit the infant's bottom, I now consider this thing a ""must have.""That being said, the top on this puppy is NOT designed well. It often will not close all the way resulting in crispy wipes and it is attached to the warmer body by two miniscule plastic pips that break easily, rendering the whole thing a lot harder to use.I'd pass on this one."
3,Decent Warmer,"I bought this warmer before my 1st daughter was born (now she's 4 1/2 mo). I've never had problems with the lid. I started out with just the regular wipes (not the pop ups)-works great just DON'T fill it up all the way with wipes, the wipes on top tend to dry up (that's why I didn't give it 4 stars). Doesn't work too well with the pop up wipes though, the wipes kept falling back in and when it did stay up, sometimes it would dry up. At the time, this was my only choice (local TOYS R US store couldn't get the other brand in stock) but overall, works well if you only fill it up half way--which I don't mind doing."
4,Okay,"I gave it 4 stars, because I have nothing to compare it to. I had never heard of wipe warmers before my mother-in-law purchased this for our son. He used to cry every time we wiped his bottom b/c of the coldness, but now he's perfectly content during diaper changes. Also, a little tidbit, we just use thin, small baby washclothes, get them wet, and put in a little soap, and they work great as reusable wipes. I just wash them along with the cloth diapers. As for this specific product, I read that for other parents the lock broke off.We've had this warmer for nearly a month now, and the lid has been just fine."
2,Works only if you renew your wipes supply daily.,"I bought this wipe warmer as the weather got colder here in Georgia and so far have not been impressed. Two problems. 1) The wipes stay warm for about .0042 of a secod so by the time you pop them out and get them to your son's tushy they are lukewarm at best. 2) They advertise how intelligent their top warming design it, but that's only for the wipes that are touching the top of the product. Once you get half way through your wipes, there isn't any way for those wipes to benefit from the warming device (placed directly below the lid) since they cannot reach it. They should install some sore of spring device so that all wipes are touching the warmer no matter how low your wipe supply is getting. I will continue to use it but wish I had though more about the product's design."
4,Must have!,"We've had this for a year and a half and the lid just broke off. I'm still using it until I get another. I'm taking this one to my parent's house, so there are warm wipes there too! I'm getting another one for our house, as baby #2 is on the way. I can't imagine not having this. Would you want you bottom wiped with a cold wet wipe? I've never had any problems with discoloration and the only time my wipes are dry are when the lid doesn't get closed. I'm sure my daughter appreciates it!"
4,Mine works fine,I have never had any problem with the lid breaking. I found that one type of wipe will dry out if you fill it all the way. Otherwise no problems. If nothing else it is a more attractive way to store wipes and baby doesn't get quite a shock as with the cold wipes.
2,Not as great as it seems,"I got this wipe warmer as a gift and thought it would be the greatest thing - unfortunately it's not! The lid broke off in the first week and now won't stay on. It also is difficult to get the wipes out - when you pull on one, other ones come out. You need to remember to push them back in, otherwise they completely dry out. Even though it's nice to have the warm wipes to use, I would not suggest spending the money on this warmer."
2,It's Okay,"This warmer is okay. I received this as a gift and at first I thought it was great because it can hold so many wipes. But, before the week was out, my wipes were dried out. I know we are so supposed to rotate, but everyday? What's the point. I also received one of the warmers that wraps around the wipe container, now that one is awesome. I recommend the wrap around, that way you don't lose any wipes."
1,Why bother?,"By the time you get the wipes from the warmer to baby's bottom, the wipes are cold! This is one item any new mother can live without. We used ours for about a week, then we realized that we didn't really need it. This is a frivolous item, totally unnecessary. I would not recommend it."
2,Flimsy Lid !!,"I received this warmer when my son was born. I had to return it because the lid broke off after a week. It is my 2 nd warmer, and the lid is already broken.... The opening is a little too wide and the wipes keep falling in. I noticed that if I fill it up to about 2/3 the wipes don't dry out. I would definitely recommend a wipe warmer if your baby, like my son, was born in the winter. He never woke up at night when I had to change him because the wipes were warm on his skin and it didn't startle him as a cold wipe would. This said, I like the concept of a warm wipe but I don't like this specific warmer. I would have bought a different brand if I had known that after a few days the lid would break."
3,Wipe Warmer,My husband and I have been pretty happy with this product. It's true that the lid breaks within the first week no matter how delicately you open it and the opening is too large so it doesn't tear off one wipe at a time. That is why I am rating it with 3 stars. It serves it's pupose though. You get nice warm moist wipes each time. We haven't ever had them dry out or brown on us and our baby likes the warm wipes. Wipes cool so easily once they hit the air it almost seems pointless but we like it for using warm wipes on her face and hands too. It would be a great product if the two major problems were fixed. We just open the lid each time we need to get a wipe out.
1,Disappointed,I received this as a gift. Thought it was great for about a week. Then the lid broke. The wipes were always soaking wet. The wipes did not pop out of the container correctly. I had to continue to open up the container to get the soaking wet wipe. Save yourself the troble and mess. Skip over this item when registering!
1,Broke Right Away!,"Although I too, eagerly anticipated this product, I was sorely disappointed when the lid broke off after only a few days. Another downfall of this product is the fact that the wipes on top dry out, regardless if you add extra water. In fact the wipes on the bottom become quite soggy with the extra water! Because of these design flaws, I no longer recommend this product to friends or family."
3,No problems with this wipe warmer.,"There are no problems with this wipe warmer such as leakage or browning of wipes. However, it just barely takes the chill off of the wipes and I wish they were a bit warmer. That being said, at least it is not a shock to the baby when an ice cold wipe hits his bum in the middle of the night."
2,Mine quit retracting after the thrid use.,This thing is of mediocre quality at best. Mine quit retracting within the first week of using it.
3,too smooth,"This wasn't what I was seeking. It's nice, but for me it's too westernized. Authentic Balkan music loses a lot of its verve when softened by western european instruments. The album Folksongs of Rumania did suit me though. If you want the haunting Balkan sound ""Folksongs..."" will fill the bill."
4,Beginner opera addicts,"fantabulous!!! a must have! I had to get it for a beginner italian opera course but am now obsessed and listen to it all the time ... if you know opera at all you will appreciate it more, i only say that because after watching these songs i understand them so much better and want to listen to their emotion constantly. so, i advise, rent some popular operas then listen to this cd, then experience exaltation. haha enjoy."
4,A regular source of inspiration for me,"I have used a good number of the designs presented in this book for my own creations. Lots of contemporary floral designs and some traditional victorian patterns. Projects range from relatively simple to very complex - designs that fit very well in homes as in commercial establishments. I have adapted one design in this book to be placed in a piece of furniture that I created. All is in black and white, no pictures of completed projects."
3,It is Ok but...,"The designs are wonderful;however, they are all in black and white.. I expected more..."
2,not so good,"I can't find these particular Haribo Konfekt anywhere in the US and I was so happy to find them on amazon, actually my husband surprised me and ordered them for me. It was great to have them again but they are not fresh and seemed dry and not chewy like they're supposed to be. we ate them all but will not order again."
2,Allsorts are all different!,Still looking for an allsort compareable to Wilkinsons/Bassetts. This was not it. Haribo candies are good but not in licorice.
3,"Very Cute, but has some issues....","My daughter got the entire Bratz Kidz line for her 8th birthday. The dolls are very cute and she loves them. However, they have thick legs that are hard to get into the clothes (pants) and their hands are hard to fit in the long sleeve shirts. Translation: I have had to do a lot of the dressing...UGH!! The packaging is unbelievable! I spent over 1.5 hours getting everything out of their packages. I don't think I have ever seen so many rubber bands, twist ties and threads all individually blister packed. It took an exacto knife and some very sharp scissors to get the job done and I ended up accidentally cutting a hole in one of the little outfits. I think they could survive a nuclear attack! Give us parents and our landfills a break MGA!"
3,what,i like this toy.but it takes a iong time to get her[or he]out of its package.it takes me like a over a hour.it is hard to get the clothes on.of the hands and feet.becaues i say that they do the clothes frist.
2,Cheap material,Product is made of very cheap material. At first I thought that the pantyhose had been switched out of the packaging. Material is almost like a very fine bug net.
2,this is not a sports bra,"This is a comfy item and cute under clothing like camis, etc. But it is not a sport bra. I bought it for hot yoga but there's no way I could wear this to work out. There's practically zero support. Maybe if you were very small breasted but for medium to larger girls this is a ""no"". I like it, just not for sports. The only reason for my 2 star review is that it is listed as a sports bra and that is extremely misleading."
4,Simple and good,"I ordered this bra top specifically to use in yoga, Bikram in particular. It's really comfortable and fits well. I probably wouldn't wear it running as it's not too supportive but it's good for low impact activities. I'll most likely order more as you can't beat the price."
3,"Small Feet, Big Hips","Quality of product is excellent. However, it is made of pre-formed fabric for the foot, ankle, calf and thigh. That is, if your particular foot, ankle, calf or thigh are not about the same size as the product measurements, the fabric doesn't stretch proportionately to fit your particular size. Instead, it will wrinkle in the area that requires a smaller fit. For example, I ordered a Queen Size and because my foot was not as large as the pre-formed foot on the hose,the product wrinkled around the foot and ankle area. Some of us just have large hips and the rest of our body is average. This manufacturer automatically assumes we are ""queen sized"" all over. Not the case."
2,Almost perfect,These are perfect for wearing under low cut v neck shirts which is why I wanted them. The only drawback is they smell strongly of rubber. I have yet to get the smell out so I don't even wear them.
3,Massaging Back Scrubber,"This item is fairly good - the handle gets slippery when you are using soap and it is hard to control at times, so keep a towel handy so you can keep your grip!"
1,Awful,"The scrubbing pads did not fit the brush head. They looked miniature next to the part that they were supposed to fit over. We tried every imaginable way to put them on, unsuccessfully. The cost to return it was prohibitive, so we gave it to a neighbor who said she would create some kind of pads so she could use it herself. Very disappointed. I ordered it for my handicapped sister."
2,Great for younger babies...,"We got this mat as a gift for our 4 month old son. We set it up and slid him under. He lasted about 2 minutes. He grabbed a hold of the mat with both hands and brought the whole thing down! Everything is connected and very light, so there was no harm done. I can see this mat being great for younger babies that just lie there and look up and around. Not for active ones."
5,An amazing activity center,"We just love this play mat! Our son is 2 months old, and loves the frog mirror. I love that the play mat is so colorful and has so many possibilities. I love the catipillar that helps assist tummy time.This play mat is also very easy to set-up and take down. Overall, we are very pleased."
1,What a WASTE!,"With 13 birds - from finches to macaw - I need a good poop cleaner that is safe for birds. This product doesn't do any better job than water and elbow grease. I'll stick with my preferred household cleaning product Greased Lightening, it's inexpensive and does a great job on multiple jobs including laundry stains. No need to waste your money on Poop Off!"
2,large dog bed,"Came as promised, but not as comfortable as I expected, all my dogs (4) avoid it and refuse to use it....but now as it has been on the floor and dirty and don't feel I can return it, so I will donate it to a rescue group or shelter....it was pretty pricey, so I am disappointed."
2,"Much more ""country"" than I expected.","I had heard about Gram Parson's influence on The Byrds, and even the Eagles. Other than the opening song, his music is much more on the country side than on the pop side. I like The Byrds, Poco, etc. But this is too country for my taste."
3,Dissapointed,"I'm sure this nailer is as good as reviewed above. What disappoints me about this is that DeWalt does not include a valve stem on the nailer. I thought I was going to unbox this and be firing away. But instead, I had to make a trip to the Home Depot for a $1.89 part. They couldn't include one with the nailer? Come on, DeWalt, $1.89. Put valve stems in the package."
3,take the good with the bad,"I was excited to find a CD version of this very old and quirky, but interesting, album.The material is all there, but the quality of the CD is pretty darned near terrible: some audible background hum and an occasional pop and click on the CD. The liner notes have nothing to do with the original vinyl LP liner notes.So all in all, I'm glad to have the CD, but I think that I will dig out my vinyl copy and see if I can get a better transduction to digital."
3,Nice Carpet but fades fast in the sun,"We bough this recently and after 2 months the lettering has faded since it is in a sunroom, thus I am disappointed with it's quality, however, if it was not exposed to the sun as much, it probably would be fine."
5,Doormat for wine lovers,"This was a gift I sent to friends in California who are wine lovers, they loved this doormat, they put it in front of their huge EuroCave winecellar. This item shipped immediately and it arrived to them in perfect condition and they were really thrilled with it."
4,If only this recording HAD a Rigoletto,"Giulini is magnificent...the younger Domingo is outstanding...Cotrubas, with her oddly unique voice, is quite fine. But Cappuccilli! I have never heard him in any recording in which he projected anything but a solid, lovely, and utterly bland and characterless voice. The operative words might be: disappointing, boring, and--you get the point. For Giulini alone, the recording *might* get five stars. But without a Rigoletto, well, it's a true shame. I'll keep listening, and pretend that I'm hearing Merrill or Warren, or even Fischer-Dieskau."
5,Ranma 1/2 is one of the most entertaining manga ever!,"Vol. 5, like all the rest, is full of laughs, twists, and great characters. I can't say more cuz I don't want to give anything away!"
5,The Ranma 1\2 Graphic Novel Series,I am 15 years old and greatly enjoy this series. Rumiko Takahashi is a wonderfully skilled storyteller. Her ability to write well is well complimented by her wonderful art and well developed not to mention rather lovable charectors. It is a great series for any body who likes anime and also a great way to become introduced to it. Even if you dont follow the series you will love any one of the graphic novels.
5,Sensational!,I think this choir is awesome! These young ladies have true talent! Keep up the good work girls!
1,An insult to other Christians,"I picked up this book at the library in hopes of finding some information on homeschooling. What I found was a fourteen person family of fundamentalist Christians who believe, among other things, that spanking is all right, that psychology is an evil lie invented by the non-Christian sinners, and that Dungeons and Dragons is part of the occult.They are very narrow-minded and do not provide real information to help people out with their quest to properly homeschool. This books is good for nothing more than a laugh at the psychotic things fundies get up to when they attempt to ban anything that could encourage free thought in their children."
5,Great gift!!Perfect for little girls.,Purchased for a neighbor girl and they say its great and she loves it. Perfect for her so her parents say so must be good.
4,good,this a great toy! it teaches you that different people can have different jobs and its really fun 2 play with! its really durable!
1,"Doctor is male, teacher and artist are female","My four year old twins love Polly Pocket. It is a very nice toy for their fine motor skills. However, many of the Polly Pocket dolls are in bikinis or mini skirts and do ""girly things"" like shopping or lounging by a pool. I ordered this item for Christmas because I thought it would provide the girls different, positive, affirming choices for playing with their Polly Pocket dolls.They opened it up on Christmas day, the girls definitley honed in on the doctor being a male, and the other professions being female. The female dolls have much more traditionally female jobs - teacher and artist (absolutely nothing wrong with those professions at all, just limits the kids' notions of what they can do when they get older). The doctor is so buff that the female clothes do not fit him, and vice versa. Very disappointed in this toy."
2,Reinforces stereotypes,"I was looking for a new Polly set for my daughter and was very disappointed when I came across this set in my search. We bought her orginal Polly for a plane trip, and it has kept her entertained for long periods, although the small pieces tend to get lost, and some pieces have broken. My daughter has a father for a doctor and a grandfather who is a nurse. I thought it was very disappointing that the nurse's costume is a dress, and the male polly is dressed as the doctor. The costumes should be designed so either male or female dolls could be any of the career choices."
4,"Santeros, Congos in lyrical flow","At first this seems very ceremonial and sedate. Despite its sanctity the grooves derived from this are seminal to the entire diaspora. The executive producer is Don Dinero and this may explain the smooth flow of these orishas. It is obvious from the first track this is not a secular rendition, but a cd of praise and worship. The drumming is seondary to the chanting, and this can be a turn off. The price offered here is well worth having this in any collection. It would be a disservice to say this is HIP HOP SANTERIA, but the lyrical flow is hypnotic. There are fabulous touches of avant garde jazz, gospel drumming and guaguanco. If you bought this do not return it, because you will buy it a year or two from now."
3,Buyer beware,"If you are buying this book from an amazon market place source find out for sure if the cd comes with it. Mine didn't and it did not say that up front. YOU NEED THE CD. The title is: Dos mundos: En breve with Listening Comprehension Audio CD but most don't have the CD. I think Amazon should make them listed under just Dos mundos En breve book, or book without CD."
5,Very pleased with this order and service,I was very pleased with the quick service and condition of the book was acceptable for my purposes. Would not hesitate to order from this company again.
5,They all do the same thing,Gels are all pretty much the same so I just looked for best price. You can't beat this price for this size container and shipping was reasonable.
5,The most endearing music to myself and my child,"I have owned Spirit Feathers since it first came out. In college, my dog stayed with me in my apartment and we would go to sleep listening to it. I am now 38 years old and still play 'repeat all' on my c.d. player for both my daughter's room and mine at night, literally every night. My daughter and I both agree that Spirit Feathers is the only c.d. that you can't get tired of for background relaxing music. And not only that, it takes you into a magical place where you can become more creative in your thinking. I can't praise it enough. This c.d. has stayed with me for a long time and I don't plan on losing it."
4,pronumciation of bible names,I am very pleased with the book I ordered for Bible name pronumciation. I purchased a used one but it was in very good condition and arrived more quickly than they said it would.
3,Who's Who?,"Goh Aik Guan's review of this CD is unfortunate as the F major concerto is not played by Argerich - it's Rabinovitch who plays this one, and it's not to my taste either."
2,Predictable and solved in record time,"I found this book a chore to read. Really, who cares about how untamable Desiree's hair is on a humid day or how fat she is and why she won't exercise? She also is unable to tell the slime who screwed her over for another woman that she can't represent him! This woman is a doormat and hardly an example to good/fun PI novels. I figured out the killer on page 92-3 as soon as they were talking about Regis & Kathie Lee and plodded through the rest to see how Eichler would resolve this story. It's definitely not a good one, but as I am working my way through the series, I find that most of these novels have been in the 2-3 star range."
1,Are we trying to teach antisocial behaviour?,"I find this a terrible show for young children: Max is a spoiled little brat who always gets what he wants, at the expense of his long-suffering sister. What makes it worse for me is the fact that it is usually quite clear that Max knows he is being bad -- he turns around and ""stage winks"" at the camera when he's going to be willfully defiant or disobedient. I am sorry, but this strikes me as a truly terrible precedent to set for children. He never learns his lesson, he's never sorry, and he's constantly enabled by Ruby and Louise. In addition, his sister can be moderately smug and condescending.Please don't show your children this show! This is not a set of life lessons we need to be perpetrating.And... for the record... where are their parents? I come out of this wanting to ring up Child Services and the Supernanny."
3,"There are only 6 episodes, not 12 as stated!","My 4 year old loved the movie, but I bought it on the assumption of it being 12 episodes in length, there are only 6. So, I rewind alot, but disappointed since the editor said 12."
4,A FAVORITE,"My 2 1/2 year old son LOVES this DVD, being a big Max & Ruby fan. My only complaint is that the image of Ruby flying a kite on the ""menu"" list does NOT appear in any episode. So my son requests time and time again the ""Ruby kite"" story which isn't on this DVD - doesn't make sense. ""Chocolate Chicken"" and ""Quiet Max"" are his favorites."
3,Pronunciation Problem!,"I love Max and Ruby--But--I noticed the last few days that my 3yr old son has started to drop his r's at the end of words. This video is the culprit! He normally has great vocabulary and pronunciation, so I think we will ban Max and Ruby for a while. By the way, you may have to watch a few episodes before catching on that Ruby has a very interesting dialect, or a speech problem."
5,grandson loves this,My 20 month old grandson adores Max and Ruby. He could watch them for hours.I recieved this from the seller very quickly. Thank you. Nancy
5,max and ruby: springtime for max and ruby,"This video based on the books about max and ruby is wonderful, my toddler really enjoys watching it."
5,A good friend.,What a nice Bible given to me from a friend. It has wide margins; but I'll never write in it. But I will use it for my daily reading. Thanks to my friend.
2,OVERLONG TV MOVIE!!,"The movie doesn't have any good acting (all mediocre) and Bergin (who I liked in ""Lost World"") isn't very good as the doctor. I'd get it though for the really fake (but hillarious) cat-snake!"
4,Took a little longer to arrive than hoped,"This was a gift and unfortunately it took a while to arrive. However, the item itself is great and came as advertised."
2,Beware!,"This is a so-so Wynton Kelly trio album, but the imminent demise of Mobley, even in 1967, is painfully obvious. No ideas, difficulty with intonation, trouble with melody,it's all here. I saw Mobley 10 years later in New York in a so-called comeback, where he had no emboucher(sp) at all and didn't know where he was,but this is almost as bad. A sad ending for an under-rated,innovative,great hard-bopper."
4,Mellow 60's psych pop,"A mix of folk, pop, and light psychedelic done with studio polish. These are the kind of songs I would consider safe to play around parents circa late 60's. The Monkees ""Porpoise song"" gives you good idea of what to expect. Despite their pop origins, some of these songs are pretty good. The World Column's ""Lantern Gospel"" a slow moody piece with simple guitar, electric organ, and an eastern sounding horn instrument at the end. The flute playing in Northcott's ""Who Planted Thorns..."" Nice sitar sound with Noel Harrison's ""Sign Of The Queen"". The Glass Family singing no need to hide in a house of glass with electric organ and trippy sound effects. And my favorite, The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band's ""Smell of Incense"" with their slow drumming and guitar picking. Again, don't expect hard psychedelia on this CD. It's tame by comparison to other albums, but some of the cuts are still enjoyable."
1,**WORST**SOUND**EVER**,"I could have produced a better quality sound back in the day with a $70.00 Pioneer cassette deck. Actually, I did record and produce better sounding material around the same time as these recordings with a 1st generation cassette deck. Potential buyers should notice there is no way to sample the selections. Now I know why.Buyers beware of this product. Whether this is a defective product or unlistenable c**p; someone should be held accountable for this out and out ripoff."
5,Inside AutoCad 12 is worth every dollar.,"Inside AutoCad 12 For DOS ISBN 1562050559While a co-worker was spending hundreds of dollars tolearn AutoCadat the local collage, I learned as much atthe same pace at home withthis fine book. It should be sub-titled as a tutorial. The book beginsassuming you know nothing about AutoCad,and carefully explains in astraight-forward method all you need to know. Everything is done insequence so each excercise teachesnew commands to be used in followingdrawings. It is a great primerfor new users learning 2-D basics, and Ihave shared it with experienced users at work as a reference manual for2-Dand 3-D drawings. The book comes with a disk with programsto helpyou learn which was a real time-saver for me. I would recommend this bookto all beginning and professionalAutoCad users. I have other titles fromThe New Riders Publishing Company, and they have all been a very good investment."
2,"poor, poor",This book is embarrassing. In my opinion the Vault Career Guide to Marketing and Brand Management is a superior guide to careers in marketing. Good luck.
3,Disappointing...,I read through this book because I was interested in the Marketing field. It was a total disappointment; it gave a very vague overview and a lack of useful resources to enter the career effectively. I ended up going to http://www.MarketingCrossing.com through Google and found a great resource! It had quite a few job postings- more than any other site- and it gave jobs only from employer web sites. It got me in contact with people who gave me all the information I could want about about marketing.http://www.MarketingCrossing.com.
3,Market Crossing is more insightful than Harvard,"This book was very helpful in narrowing down my job selection process. Another resource I used was Marketing Crossing, http://www.MarketingCrossing.com , to look for a job because, unlike many of its competitor's sites, Marketing Crossing hosts jobs from only employer websites and supports many more jobs than any other site I have ever used. But do not take my word for it, check out their website for yourself, they helped me find a job which eventually turned into my career."
4,Great introduction to Clark,"This is a fine introduction to the songs of one-time Byrd Gene Clark - especially if you can't bring yourself to fork out for the 2-CD import FLYING HIGH. There are a few notable omissions: Dillard & Clark's ""Polly"" and ""Why Not Your Baby""; and ""The True One"" from NO OTHER. But there's also some inspired inclusions: 2 wonderful tracks from 1970/1 with the reunited Byrds - ""She's The Kind Of Girl"" and ""One In A Hundred""; ""Here Tonight"" recorded with The Flying Burrito Bros; and the masterpiece that is ""Spanish Guitar"". You'll end up coming back for more..."
2,Gun Case,"I was disappointed in this case because I could not get a large frame revolver in this case even though it is advertised as a ""large"" case.. It seems to be made for an automatic pistol that has a grip that is about 90 degree angle to the frame."
4,Great for the price,I got about what I expected for around ten dollars. I am please with how inexpensive this case was.Only downside that this product has: cheap thin foam inserts. I might be replacing the foam inserts with silicone impregnated cloth.Fits 92fs + one clip just right.
4,Works for a Glock 20,"This box is the right size for a Glock 20. There isn't enough extra to carry a clip, but it works well for getting the gun to the range.I wouldn't recommend it for locked storage as anyone with a knife could probably get in. Other than that it is a sturdy storage box.As others have mentioned, the foam on the inside could be a little bit thicker, but that doesn't detract from its usefulness."
2,Pistol Case,"I returned this pistol case because the foam padding on the inside was to thin. No matter what type of hand gun I placed inside it would slid around inside the case. The foam padding on the inside needs to be changed so as to hold what is placed inside. Then I also found a case of better quilty at Gander Mt for a better price, but if they would fix the foam inside it would be a not so bad hard hand gun case."
3,"Good case, poor padding.","This case appears to be well designed and constructed, with two substantial latches, a decent full-length hinge and a sturdy shell. However, the internal padding listed as ""high-density foam"" is very thin and light, and not what I would consider high-density at all. Plus, it's loose in the case and falls out when you open it, and does not wrap around the pistol at all, leaving it relatively unprotected and free to rattle around inside the case. For the price, I'm not going to bother returning it, but it was not up to the standards I expected. Too bad. A few extra cents invested in better quality padding and this would have been a winner."
5,just barely fits a Combat Commander 1911,"Great lockable case, especially for the price. As others warn, size is relative. The ""Medium"" case is perfect for a Bersa Thunder .380, and this ""Large"" just fits my 1911 Combat Commander."
1,This is *not* a recent edition,This is a reprint of the third edition .... the latest is the eighth edition. Be very careful when ordering from Amazon!!! This is the second time I have ordered a book and received an old edition.
3,Critics - please suggest alternatives!,A few of the reviewers are scathing in their remarks. I'd appreciate it if they would suggest alternative titles or sources!
3,relevant review of bullet performance,"good review of bullet performance. gives information on many bullet types and how they perform in test medium and ""street"" performance history."
1,Buyer beware!,"The reader needs to Google, ""Book Review Review By Martin L. Fackler, MD."" and then look for the Firearms Tactical Website. Dr. Martin did an excellent review of this book and if you read what he wrote, then you would discover that ""Street Stoppers --The Latest Handgun Stopping Power Street Results"" is trash!Please do some research before buying this book... Dr Martin writes, """"too good to be true"" statistics, and clear indications that the authors of ""Street Stoppers"" fail to understand the most basic of scientific principles and discourse, nothing in this book can be relied upon."""
1,Something is wrong,"The alto chimes should be 50"".Not 30"".I believe these are not the alto sized chimes- perhaps the mezzo?"
1,"Total Waste Of Money, Product Is Useless","this product does not provide any numbness at all. Its a total bogus product, i didnt have to wear glove as suggested by them to avoid numbness in my fingers while applying. i had always shaved my body hair n then i heard about this product, thought i give it a try,I had my chest waxed and this product didnt help at all to reduce pain. I WILL NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL this specific product. I heard there are some products that do help, i m out searching"
3,"+1/2 -- Long Ryders major label debut: more Americana, less paisley","Graduating from the indie Frontier label (where they waxed the EP ""10-5-60"" and the LP ""Native Sons""), the Long Ryders moved to Island for this 1985 release. Their roots-rock sound was intact, but mostly shorn of the neo-psych inflections of the Paisley Underground. Their new songs went deeper, with lyrics that surveyed the inequities of the Reagan era. The guitars were tougher and bluesier and dropped the chiming tones of the Byrds. In many ways the Long Ryders followed the same path Steve Wynn charted for the Dream Syndicate, shucking off the retro shackles to get at something more personal and original. Heavier times begat heavier music, which is satisfying for its depth, but just isn't the hummable, sing-along ear candy of their first two releases. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings. [2007 hyperbolium dot com]"
1,Fake Beware of forgeries - Become a well-informed connoisseur. These are fake,"Important fact to consider: Only two-manufacturer produce hand made Laguiole knives for exports in the village of Laguiole, France. They are La Coutellerie de Laguiole aka ""Laguiole de L'Artisan"" and ""Les Forge de Laguiole"". Other very small shops make knives in the village, but most of their business is from tourisms, and they do not export.A rip off!"
3,Word of Warning,"I bought these knives as a Christmas gift. Unfortunately, when this set of knives arrived the wooden box had multiple cracks in it and it was wrapped in filthy plastic packaging. I literally don't know how I will give them as a gift because the inside of the plastic package is so dirty. Also, the knives say BARENTHAL ""L'art et la table"". Nowhere on the knives do they say Laguiole -- nowhere!Given the price of the item, it's not a good purchase. They look like some $10 item that I might pick up while waiting in line at a cash register.Since they're a gift I haven't used them and can't comment on their performance -- hopefully they are as great as the Laguiole knives that my husband and I have."
5,Absolutely the Best Zorro Ever,"I'm 57 yrs old and have been a Zorro fan/atic since age 4, and a Zorro video collector for years. In my opinion, this series is absolutely the BEST incarnation of Zorro ever made, and I have them ALL (with a couple of hard-to-find old movie exceptions. Do NOT try to ""compare"" it to the Disney series. They're totally different styles. Both are great. The Disney series is pure WALT Disney style family fun. This series has more ""meat"" to it, much better character development, less comedy, but still quite a few comedic moments. Very family friendly but also excellent for adults."
5,Zorro,"The item was perfect, the picture could have been better but it is an old serie so they didnt have HD."
5,New Worlde Zorro--Excellent Family Viewing!,"This set is worth every penny you'll pay for it. As a longtime Zorro fan, I can safely say that this series provides quality acting, sufficient action, and good family values at a time when they are sorely needed in the modern world. Duncan Regehr leads a fine supporting cast and he provides a depth to the character of Zorro not seen before or since. I liked the Disney series and I enjoyed the Banderas films, but this series remains most faithful to the the intent of the original Zorro stories. Buy it before it goes out of print as the modern-day classic that it is."
2,Zorro Fan,Happy to have the collection however the quality of the transfer is at best equivalent to vhs . Still watchable
3,How they manage to shoot a show in the 1990's...,"How they manage to shoot a show in the 1990's, with better technology, etc, and make it worse than the old Disney show? Go figure."
5,Ageless Enjoyment,"While I grew up on the Disney series, this entire series quickly became the real classic when it appeared on TV. Every week when this rendition of Zorro came on our living room was full of our two daughter's friends. I contribute this to the short, simple, moral story lines, romance, humor, black and white battle of good and evil, and justice prevailing without descriptive or gory violence. All these kids are now grown up but their favorite memory of time spent in our home was the Zorro episodes and when I told them I had the whole series everyone wants to set up some fun evenings again and bring their husbands and wives along! Not a bad recommendation if you ask me!"
5,Very entertaining - great for the entire family!,"We've only gotten to watch a few episodes during a ""Zorro"" festival which was aired on TV a few years ago, so our entire family will be looking forward to viewing the entire series in the new DVD collection. (Frankly, I should have thought of it as a Christmas gift for a couple of other people.)As I remember, there is not any heavy violence, cursing, etc., so it should be great for most any age viewer. If I know A&E;, there will be some great bonus features, too. Viva, Zorro!"
3,"Fun series, low quality DVDs","I was happy to see these come out, and had been waiting for them. Some of the episodes have been chopped, and maybe it's just my DVDs, but a few of the episodes freeze and skip in places. However, the $40 price tag was fine for getting all 4 seasons.I watched the show when it came out on Family Channel, and enjoyed it. Yes, it's not up there with the Disney series, but it's not the worst Zorro series, either. It has its own charm. Like other reviewers have said, I wish it were less choppy, better restored and with actual bonus stuff from the show. I already own the 1920 Zorro, as that has been out on DVD for some years now. I didn't need it tagged onto this set."
4,Just what it says...INTERMEDIATE,"This is NOT an easy book. It would be a complete waste of time for a student who hasn't already taken beginning accounting. It basically goes through the balance sheet and other financial statements line-by-line, as many beginning texts do. BUT, it digs deeper. It's looking for the EXCEPTIONS to the usual, easy-to-learn rules.It is very comprehensive and the end of chapter questions are extensive. If you can more or less master this book...you're ready for accountancy. If you just can't ""get"" the material, maybe another career choice is better.The writing style is hardly ""reader friendly"" but it isn't too stiff, has lots of examples and charts and tables, and is broken up into many ""little"" sections. Any instructor / course would be insane to have someone try to get through the material properly in just one semester. It's a 2 semester book, for sure."
3,Good book but it has a serious problem,"As you might know, this book is the most famous book in accounting field. However, there is a problem for a person whowant to do self-studying because only instructors can or is qualified to get solution manuals provided by Wiely Publishing Co. Therefore, I would like to strongly recommend another books especially to self-studying persons. As most accounting guies have recognized, exercises and practice problems without solution or explanation are of no use."
2,Intermediate Accounting,This book is poorly written. Many concepts are presented unclear and more complicated than necessary. There are not enough worked out problems to check yourself on. There is an unacceptable amount of errors throughout the textbook and the online website only works if your teacher sets it up for the class. Individual students cannot access the website.
5,excellent book,"I think it's a great book. I have taken two courses with this book, and though I haven't looked at other intermediate books, I find this well written and easy to follow. I have also taken Advanced Accounting, and I think this book is alot better than my advanced text by Larsen"
1,Book sucks,This book is gayest thing ever. I have to google every thing in the book to get it properly. The author must be a virgin
4,Must Have Bookshelf Item for Accountants,"As an accountant who is many years removed from intermediate accounting courses in school, this book is great to have to brush up on rarely encountered topics. In fact, I had an older version in college that I unfortunately chopped up for easier toting around campus. Oh well. In my opinion, this book is valuable enough as a resource that I paid $25 to get a used copy. Keep in mind that many subjects are constantly changing, so it won't be your only resource if you're an accounting professional, but it will help in a pinch!"
4,Good book for intermediate,"This book is rather hard, but it is extensive and you learn a good bit. I don't think it is any harder than an intermediate accounting book should be.. accounting is not easy. My school divides the book into 3 seperate consecutive courses, 303, 304, and 305. I really like this book."
2,Far too Simplified,SUPER easy book for learning accounting. I enjoyed reading it at home and am going to read it for a third time: cover to cover. Very relaxed subject material. Only an idiot would have problems understanding the material. Should be mandatory 3rd grade class work.
1,publisher rip off,"All textbooks over $50 are a rip off, WRITE A LETTER TO YOUR STATE SENATOR TELLING THEM YOU WON'T STAND FOR THESE OUTRAGEOUS PRICES ON TEXTBOOKS FOR SCHOOL. MOST STUDENTS CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THESE RIDICULOUS PRICES!!! WE CAN BEAT THE ENDLESS NEW EDITION CYCLES THAT PUBLISHERS RIP US OFF WITH IF WE MAKE IT KNOWN!! WE CAN'T AND WON'T STAND FOR THIS!"
1,what a poor accounting textbooks!!!!,"this textbook is absolutely horrible for students. if i were teacher, i'd never use this book for my students."
1,Not in French!!!,"The comic book was in ok condition, but I wanted the French language version but got the English version instead!!Could not even return it as I took all the books as gifts to India...very disappointing!"
4,Henry David and Emily ?,"Henry David Thoreau and Emily Dickenson together ... well perhaps? Detective Homer Kelly and beautiful librarian Mary Morgan together ... you'll just have to read it! The 60 short chapters keep the story and the mystery moving along shapely, like a bite out of a McIntosh apple or a cool swig of apple cider. Perhaps there is nothing transcendental about murder, but each chapter is introduced by a quote from Thoreau, Emerson, Dickenson, or the Alcotts, and the quotes help you feel the presence of these in Concord. A good mystery and a fun read! As a bird watcher, I would have to question the realism of the Bald Eagle being Teddy's last bird on Thoreau's list, particularly since the now extinct, Passenger Pigeon was seen by Thoreau."
3,"Attractive, but average.","This flatware is nice looking and colorful. But the ball design on the ends is platic. I suspect these will endure a number of washings and then come apart or lose their color coating. There's also a little space where the center piece is assembled to the end piece you eat with -- difficult to explain. I worry about what might get into that space, water or food, yuck. I would not recommend this flatware."
3,Its written out of order....,"When writing an historic overview on a subject that you know the reader knows virtually nothing about, it should be done in chronological order.Its an informative book, but jumps around from familt to family & year to year. You will find yourself trying to put it all in perspective for days after you're done reading it."
5,MAKING YOUR BONES,"This was the very first book on the mob I read. 44 books later, it's safe to say that it helped pique my interest. Jerry Capeci breaks it down in Layman terms. Before this book, I had no idea that the mob was even structured. It begins from the very start of Cosa Nostra up until the present day mob."
3,It's all about the names,"This book could be a college guide to the Mafia and is well researched. I recommend skipping around to the chapter's you are interested in, rather than a cover to cover read. In the beginning the book tries to summarize what happened from the 1900's up to the 90's and it is far too confusing to follow all of the names, this may slow down the reader but later the book concentrates on family names, and then individuals which is far easier to follow. There are many good ""bullets"" of information, by far a good reference for the mafia intrigued."
4,A pretty good but dry overview of the mafia,"This book was well-researched, and certainly, it seemed like the author knew what he was talking about. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't, but how would I know? I'm new to the subject, after all, it IS the idiot's guide...The book was dry. Not a whole lot of stories that had much detail. I would've appreciated more detail on the various incidents, rather than 1000 blurbs all saying ""so and so whacked such and such"".But a good starter to the subject."
2,Systematic disorder,"This is probably one of the worst books on the Mafia I've ever come accross. Tons of information are thrown together without any kind of order, either conceptual or historical. The writer jumps from one topic to the other, failing to provide even a modestly organized picture of the phenomenon he's trying to explain. Deeply disappointing and a waste of time (and money)."
5,"""Your God is too Small"" for the 90s","The correlation between this book and JB Phillips classic ""Your God is Too Small"" are obvious as soon as you look at the verses of scripture which begin the work (Isaiah 44:10 & Isaiah 40:25 - both of which deal with the fact that there is none like God and our attempts to make an idol of Him are faulty), yet this book is more than just a rewriting of ""Your God..."". ""Trivialization"" takes Phillip's theme and conveys it in modern language and metaphors. Dr. McCullough chips away at the false gods of the 90s and after the dust has clear from the destruction of those false concepts that we try to pretend are God, we find a marvelous vacum that is just waiting for the true and living God to come in a fill. Dr. McCullough brings out the mystery and danger of our God and by doing this helps those believers (and non-believers) who read this work to begin to fathom what an incredible God the Lord is."
1,Sandra Felton is really obnoxious,"Her tone is so smarmy, you can tell she was never a messy person, and she looks down on messy people. Only buy her books if you want to feel bad about your mess, not if you want to clean it up!"
5,This Book Helped Me Realize Why--And How To Change,"Okay, I admit it--when I got to a certain point in this book, I cried. For so many years, I had thought of myself as just plain lazy. I mean, what else could it be? I was a lousy housekeeper. I did not WANT to be that way, I did not WANT to think of myself as lazy, but I couldn't seem to change, so there it was. I must just be lazy, and too hopeless, too bad to change. But this book told me flat-out it WASN'T laziness. I cried. For so long, I had been looking for a reason to believe that wasn't it. But I couldn't believe there was any reason, any other root cause to why my house was so messy. At that point, I was hooked. If this book, this system, could find a way to change me without me being lazy, I would do it. And I did. And you can, too. In three months I went from having no family come over in 12 years to having an online friend I'd never met before stay the night. If I can, you can. It really works."
4,Is helping me!,"I read this book as a companion to her ""Messies Manual"" book. I find that they fit beautifully together. I needed to understand that I'm not just a lazy slob- or a hopeless failure at making a home. I have a personality that is shared by many other wonderful women. Learning to work with and not against myself has given me help and HOPE.I agree- if you are looking for a how to organize your home- this won't meet your needs. If you have tried and failed at homemaking and need to figure yourself and your needs out- this is a great place to come.I feel it needs the companionship of ""The Messies Manual"" to be complete.I'd buy and read it first."
4,good read,"I read her first book many years ago, it change my life. this one is a good read, but not like the first one."
5,Virtual Secretary,"Ok, so it doesn't take dictation. However, this book saved 100's of hours of work for me, in addition to raising procedural issues I'd not considered. A book of forms and organizers. Sound tedious? I would be if you had to create them all yourself. Book includes a CD with all of the forms copy-ready on it. Within Microsoft Word, I was able to redesign them to suit my practice, adapt them to my letterhead and put together packets of forms for different purposes. I hate office work. That is not why I entered forensic psychology. If you hate it too, buy this book."
5,A must have for Forensic folks,"This book is invaluable for anyone beginning a forensic psych practice. All the forms are easily adapted with your letterhead and are provided on disc. I have updated my contracts but other than that, still use most of the forms. I present a very professional file and am readily prepared for court. My disc did not work and after repeated attempts eventually went directly to the publisher. I was then sent an email attachment of the disc. It would have been very costly on many levels to have hired an attorney or to make errors on forms, or to not be aware of forms that were needed. Well worth the small amount for the wealth of aid to your practice."
5,Very pleased with the quality,This was a purchase spurred by the reading if another book. This book is not cheap and ordering used books is always a little nerve wracking. This version of the book is beautiful and very much worth the price. The description of the wear was accurate and the reality was a pleasant surprise. The description was mild wear; the reality is a book that's been read but handled gently. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
3,antique eroticism,"""In fabulous Dutch translation: De Droom van Poliphilus, Athenaeum Polak/Van Gennep (translation Ike Cialona). Yes, an unreadable story.Boring detailed descriptions of classic style and ornamentism with a boy's quest for his loved one. Eroticism.Not really a pageturner but the ultimate slow reading read under sunny (Italian) skies.So it take years to finish it. Who cares."
1,Does not stand up,"This CD is like hearing the same thing over and over again, and the title does not represent what one would expect as traditional Yaqui music. Compare it to yaqui Ritual and festive Music CD and you would realze what a waste of money this one is. Sorry for the brutal hpnesty but I am sorry I paid for this CD."
3,Skinny Martian Manhunter,"When this Martian Manhunter figure came out it wasn't bad. It was an attempt to make a Mego-inspired line featuring the JLA, and was better than the ""nothing"" that we had before.But it wasn't a great figure, and was the worst of the line. The problem is a costume or lack thereof. The Martian Manhunter's costume consists of a cape, a pair of swim trunks and some crossed belts. Instead of creating a new body, they used one of the standard body-types and colored it green. A fine solution, but those bodies were meant to be clothed, so the Martian Manhunter looked skinny and weird.Fortunately, there is a new line out of Mego-inspired figures, and theRetro-Action DC Super Heroes Martian Manhunterblows this one out of the water.This figure was good for its time, but time has moved on! Or backwards, considering the retro-nature of the figures!"
2,waste of resources,"I enjoyed it because there are good actors and mostly good writingbut was very disappointed in the following aspects:of the three episodes, the middle one is essentially a reprise of the first and feels like stuffing before the third episode where things start to happen againthe final scene is jaw-dropping stupid, like something out of a bad American police procedural...after all the digging for the truth, the ensemble of protagonists stand and yelp at the bad guys at a school dedication about their crimes, I thought I was watching Michael Moore with a loud hailer/megahphoneAND THENColtrane is run over by one of the bad guys after this yelling fitwhat???? is this the best ending that could have been written, Coltrane must have had another engagement and the production run out of time"
5,Very Cute!,"Anyone familliar with the Passover story, yet not how to explain the concept of plagues and miracles to younger children will find amusing help with the popular characters from the Rugrats series. Also good is an animated insight into the religious heritage of Tommy's mom. END"
5,The best of many western books on this subject,"I have been teaching and practicing this artform (Chinese Brush Painting) for about 5 years and have found this among the very best of the available books on the subject. Ms. Frame takes us through the basics, with descriptions of the materials and brushstrokes that one can actually follow and put into practice -all the time keeping true to the tradition. She then takes us beyond the basics with lovely projects incorporating colour along with the ink. I would highly recommend this book along with Ning Yeh's instruction books and videos for anyone seriously interested in learning the techniques of this beautiful artform."
1,R.E.M. Doesn't Sound This Bad - Ever,"This album is a terrible interpretation of R.E.M.'s fine catalog. If you are looking for some instrumental R.E.M. check out ""The String Quartet Tribute To R.E.M."", released in 1999 also, but a much better tribute."
2,If you like R.E.M. then that's what you should listen to,"Listening to this CD just makes me long for the real thing-the real R.E.M. songs. There something about R.E.M. songs that don't seem to translate very well into classical. Maybe it's the lack of Michael Stipe's vocals and lyrics. Sure, with this CD the tunes are there, but where is the substance? It kinda sounds like elevator music to me. So I guess if you like elevator music, than you may enjoy this CD, otherwise buy the real R.E.M. instead."
1,A bad idea come to life.,"All I could think as I listened to this the first time was ""god, am I at the dentist's office?"" The orchestra doesn't play badly, in fact, they're probably pretty good. But the concept of taking away R.E.M.'s lyrics and making their songs purely instrumental wasn't solid gold.Some of the songs come off all right. The songs that were originally more orchestral, like ""Nightswimming"" and ""Everybody Hurts"" don't sound very far off. But some of the songs, especially ""Drive"" and ""Man on the Moon"" are ridiculously sipmle without words. The music is not the same without vocals, and the simplicity that is normally so intrinsic to R.E.M.'s instrumentals becomes tedious. Which is sad.But if you're looking for a laugh, try ""What's the Frequency, Kenneth?"" complete with very very cheesy sax solo.The Royal Philharmonic are reportedly really huge R.E.M. fans, so it's kind of mean to mock their effort. But some efforts are best never made."
4,Native American Music at Its Best,"A few years ago, a friend turned me on to 2 flute music Cds: ""Flute Dreams"" by Alice Gomez, et al. and ""Wind Riders"". I loved them both. They are must-haves in my CD collection. I did not like ""Wind Riders"" as much as ""Flute Dreams"" at first. Later, something kicked in. Now, I like ""Wind Riders"" more. This CD did a good job of incorporating Indian chanting and nature sounds. Bass drums gave the music an added dimension. The flute playing is top-notch. Only a couple of tunes are less than spectacular, most are just great."
4,Great insight into different business leaders,"This book does a very good job of presenting descriptions of some of the world's greatest business leaders. It shows their methods to success, personal philosophies, and business strategies. A good book for someone wanting a 'catch all' covering lessons in business leadership shown first hand by the most successful men/women in the past 200 years."
2,Sounds bad,"Okay, first off the performances are excellent but soncially this is terrible. It sounds gritty and unfocused. I was hoping for something better. In the 21st century this should be engineered to sound good. I think it's time for DG to redo this again."
2,Not what I expected (buyer beware),"It may well be a good book -- but it wasn't what I was looking for. I wanted a book that would work both ways (looking up English to Greek primarily, and also going from Greek to English). This is Greek to English ONLY. So if you don't know much Greek... this book is essentially useless to you."
4,Excellent Book!,"As a beginning storm chaser I found the book to be very well written and easy to follow. I liked the fact that while it included just enough technical information, it made for easy and entertaining reading.Being from the Texas Panhandle area myself, I was thrilled to read the many mentions of the area. A must have book for any aspiring storm chaser!"
4,"Paganini, yes, but","On the good side is the selection of pieces. I was not happy with the quality of the audio. It has a thin and weakness about it that makes me wish they'd tried harder when they produced this CD to ensure the richness of this music came through. A couple of the most familiar pieces have performances I was completely unfamiliar with, so I would recommend the CD overall for Paganini and for the excellent performances, but the product as sold deserves better engineering."
4,THE BEST OF PAGANINI,"LAS MEJORES VERSIONES DE ALGUNAS DE SUS OBRAS, TANTO POR SZERYNG COMO POR GRUMIAUX. SERIA MUY BUENO QUE ABARCARA TODAS SUS OBRAS COMO EN EL CASO DE ACCARDO."
1,Not much information,Not really a book but a pamphlet. Does not contain much information at all. Not really worth purchasing.
3,Bummed this doesn't include Craftsteak,"I bought this because I saw it in Craftsteak (Las Vegas) after a recent visit there. I do like that this cookbook has many of Tom Colicchio's thoughts on food, restaurants, etc."
2,Bad Title for this book. Should be Cooking of Craft,"I was very let down by this book. This book is mainly about how the cooking is done at Craft and has little to do with the ""Craft of Cooking"". I really doubt that I will ever need to know how to cook a 150 LB. lamb. Even at that the instructions are so basic as to be usless on how to break down the lamb. I would do like I think most would and leave this in the hands of my very valuable butcher.The book has an arrogance that I find very annoying and will not buy any other books by this author."
4,A+ Shipment!!,"The book came in perfect condition, and the shipment arrived in good time. I would buy again!"
