4,So far so good,"I purchased this Panasonic phone about a month ago and so far its performed very well. Voice quality is very clear, range is good though I do notice some slight interference if I go too many rooms (and therefore walls) away from the base station, the speaker phone is quite clear though the mic could be better. Net, net, the phone has done what I purchased it for. If you need a 2 line phone with some features, the options are few and far between. I have not used the answering machine and most likely never will. I would have preferred to buy the same phone with no answering machine, but Panasonic doesn't make it. I've had quite a few Panasonic phones over the last 20 years and have tried VTECH, Uniden, and AT&T as well. I keep coming back to Panasonic for the quality."
4,Good Cordless Phone,Positive : Good clarity and features. One of the best phones i have ever used.Negative: Cordless phone is bit expensive. It doesnot support multi voltage.
5,An excellent phone,About 2 months ago I bought this phone. So far it has worked perfectly. Everything is great about it.
4,Great home phone system,"This phone was easy to install, great instructions. Voice quality is terrific. Could have made ""on / off"" button a bit easier to see for those with less than perfect vision. Overall, an excellent buy."
4,Good phone - not great.,"The reception range is excellent. Features are great. Voice quality is good not excellent. Our one real complaint - and perhaps we have a defective model - but if you record an outgoing message for the answering machine (as opposed to using the automated built-in message), the audio quality of that recorded message is so poor people find it hard to understand your message. We have tried recording and re-recording numerous times and were never able to get a good enough quality recording."
3,Effective but Boring,"This was my first Debbie Siebers workout and I'm dissappointed. The intensity and effectiveness is there, but it is boring, non-motivation, with bad music and sound quality. There is also no chaptering or any premixes, or mix and match options like other DVDs offer.The workout style is a little like Jari Love, just less interesting and Debbie's personality is like Shelly McDonald's of Caribbean Workout. I like both Jari and Shelly and I can't say I dislike Debbie, it's just such a boring workout, I don't want to do again."
2,Unimpressed,"I really enjoyed ""Justified."" It was one of those rare albums where I liked every song. The R&B; vibe, coupled with JT's clear falsetto and clever lyrics made for a great disc. ""Future Sex,"" however, is sorely lacking. In fact, I was bored. This album could've been one long song because I wasn't sure where one track ended and another began because they're all the same. JT overuses the breathy, supposedly sexy vocals--leaving his falsetto for the choruses. On many tracks the lyrics are barely discernable. Overall, I want my money back.If you're a die-hard JT fan, then buy this. If you just happened to enjoy the first album, give this a listen before forking over any money. I wish I had!"
2,Justin Sucks,"This isn't that good of an album. ""My Love"" is kind of corny and ""Sexy Back"" is just horrible. The only good song is "" What goes around....comes around"".I got it frome my parents for Christmas because I wanted it, but I wish I didn't have it. My parents didn't even see the title or the ""Explict Lyrics"". I showed my parents it and they don't want me to listen to it. I do not recomend this weird album."
3,Was sexy ever gone?,"When someone claims they are going to bring sexy back, one would expect something smooth and devilish, but this album isn't exactly what I expected. There are a couple catchy songs, but for the most part, I'm a disappointed."
2,Eh...,"The problem that I've always had with Justin as a solo artist is that he relies way too much on beats in his music. Sure, it's catchy, but at some point it becomes annoying and repetitive. His image doesn't help either, it's becoming a cliche. I think he's way too comfortable with vocally imitating MJ and Prince. I mean to be honest, I don't think Justin is THAT talented, but i was expecting something cool and sexy out of this album, but it falls flat to just cliche beats and not much substance to make the album as a whole very interesting."
1,baby new year clown,"This guy is a joke! The harder he trys to be ""soulful"" the more laughable he becomes. He's not bringing sexy back (he did bring my lunch back up). He looks like Baby New Year,but he wants to be Stevie Wonder. Ha!"
2,"His ""Future Sex"" Plans and ""Love Sounds"" Are not for me","I'm sorry but I don't want to hear Justin's ""love sounds"" He sounds so girlie when he sings. I don't want to know his ""Future Sex"" plan or hear his love sounds. With his high voice, he can't sound too manly when he has an orgasm. Now, I give this album a second star because the lyrics are good and in some songs, he doesn't use his high voice as much. So, if his voice wasn't so high pitched, I'd probably be able to give this a higher rating"
5,Hot Album,"This CD had to grow on me... don't get me wrong. I'm a huge Justin Fan!...This Album is gutsy and different but, really HOT! I recommend it, highly"
4,HOTT CD !!!,"Bought this cd when it came out. His sound was totally diffrent from his 1st solo cd. It took a little time to grow on me . I didn't even like ""sexy back "" When I heard the frist time. But after a while , i liked it. I love "" love stoned "" and "" my love. Can't wait to see him on tour. Overall he suprised me . Didn't think he could pull this off."
1,Future Garbage/Trash Can Liner!!!,This cd is absolute trash. Perhaps the CD wouldn't be so bad if he would stop trying to sound like Prince and Michael Jackson. He's bringing sexy back? How can you bring back something you didn't ever have. One star because zero was not an option.
1,More is Less: Don't Fall For It!,"Timberlake and his record company have opted to sucker music lovers into buying a mediocre, watered-down re-release of FutureSex/LoveSounds. Deluxe edition is not the term. DeSPICABLE edition is more like it.Disc 1 contains the censored versions of most of the songs along with a few remixes. Beyonce (who also is guilty of the same CD re-releasing tactic) surprisingly downgrades the original version of ""Until The End of Time"".Disc 2 contains videos from the CD, ""Making of..."" segments, and interviews about the videos. One problem: the videos are not groundbreaking. They are not even interesting. The DVD contains a few live performances also that I think most fans can live without.Don't buy it! Timberlake, Beyonce, and Usher could take a lesson from Chris Brown who released a deluxe edition along with a plain edition of his CD. It boils down to respect for music fans. Wow! Even the CD cover looks sinister and manipulating!"
4,Justin's Music continues to evolve,"It's been four years since his last solo release and it's evident when you listen to this album. His voice is stronger, his beats are better (thanks in part to Timbaland), and his lyrics are definately more adult. I don't like every track on this album, but it is worth the money I spent on it. Keep it up Justin!"
3,Makes me think i am listening to someone else,I wonder what would justin sound like if had to himself on record? This CD is actually very good i thought i listened to and kept saying to myself who does he sound like he reminding of someone else. Yep Prince and almost anyone else from the twin city 80's era. I like it. It brings back good times. Thanks for the memories.
5,Definitely Worth Buying!,"Of all the cd's I NEVER thought I'd be listening to, this would be one of them... but after hearing it at a friend's house, I just had to have it. I'd heard some of JT's stuff on the radio, seen him perform a bit on tv, and have to admit, I was impressed. But this cd is something else. The boy-band ""boy"" is no longer. He deserves serious respect as a damned good musician w/ one hell of a sense for what people want and how to give it to them. Kudos!"
4,justin,"I thought this cd was going to be a lot better than what it is. I have to say, I was kind of disappointed. Maybe I'm just new to Justin Timberlake style, but I'm still trying to warm up to it. There are the few songs that I, I'm sure like everyone else, really like because we hear them on the radio, but the others....Not too sure about yet."
3,"Meh... there are a lot of truely great R&B artists out there, and he's not one of them","This album is good, and like other people note, much better than what we have come to expect from the former teenie-bopper. The beats are mostely original and interesting, however this album has quite a few weak songs. ""chop me up"" is just awkward, the last three songs are all less than steller because lets face it, he can sing but he just doesn't do the whole soul thing so well. On the upside, this album has some great dance/club songs, and justin can still make a hit. So if that's what you are into, grab this CD, and stop listening to it when you get to the end. If you are interested in a trendy, new approach to R&B, check out Robin Thicke."
1,What a disappointment,I really thought this was going to be a great CD from the few songs I have heard off if it then I got it! BLAHHH I was so disappointed
5,Timberlake is golden!,"I must say that I am a rocker that gave in to this pop star! Justin Timberlake made an amazing album. First sucked in by his singles, I am even more in love with other songs on the track list including ""Lovestoned"" and ""What Goes Around."" Definitely a wonderful pick!"
4,Justin Timberlake is no so cool,"But,The first time I listened to this album, I was not impressed, I was thinking, I wasted 10 bucks on this.It wasn't until I listed to 'Losing My Way' that I started to appreciate it.Losing My Way is corny, I admit, that but the it's all very catchy, it's like a cross between stan and waterfalls... very catchy pseudo-social commentary.After Forcing myself to go back and listen again, there are some song I can hear being on the radio. Everyone seems to hat this song, but everything about it is uber catchy... hook, bridge.... it's cool in it's odd little way.Summer Love -is Great, but seeing summer is over, I suspect that it won't be a single.My Love - is nice and airy with a great showcase of that falsetto that makes Justin interesting, and that giggle in the background--you can't tell me that's not meant for Mass consumption.What goes around - is damn catchy, very boy band-ish sounding, but it some how it works."
3,Justin Timberlake - FutureSex/LoveSounds,"I'm not sure if anyone has mentioned it yet, but FutureSex/LoveSounds has one of my nails-on-a-chalkboard-annoyances in it. That is the inclusion of annoying Interludes/half-songs/skits/etc. that are included on the same track # as a full song.So if you want to rip a good song (say 'Summer Love'), your MP3 ends up including the annoying 'Set the Mood Interlude' on the back half of it. It happens four times on the album! They'd be better off just having the Interludes/Preludes as their own individual track #'s. Then you could easily skip over them.OK, other than that, the album is alright. A lot of it sounds the same after awhile though. It's all about at the same speed/tempo/beats so it's hard to get through it all in one sitting.There are a definitely a few standout songs here which are sure to gain tons of airplay and bring Justin tons of fame/attention/girls. I just can't see myself listening to this, say a year from now(?)."
2,Soul Less,"I was a bit apprehensive when it came to listening to this CD. I can't say I'm the biggest fan of JT, but I thoroughly enjoyed his previous solo debut CDJustified, which was a very soulful affair. My apprehension came upon hearing the first single from this CDSexyBack, and that the majority of the CD would be produced by Timbaland. Not with standing one or two efforts (namelyCry Me a Riverwhich is a great song) I find Timbaland production soul less & cold. Alas that is how I would describe the majority of the songs on offer here. The only redeeming factors for this CD are the cuts:(Another Song) All Over Again , and Losing my Way, which benefits from a string section, & Hezekiah Walker & the Love Fellowship Choir. Very soulful. If only the rest of the CD could have followed suite."
5,Don't B a hater,"I don't who can listen TO ""until the end of time"" and hate on JT. He is doing his thing. THe first time I heard this song on the radio, I was like who is that?!>!>! I had no idea that is was curly tops! LOL He has so many hits on this c.d. With good and real songs like that, he is sure to rise to the top in my book."
5,Very nice,"When I first got the CD as a gift, I only listened to the songs I had heard on the radio. One day I decided to sit down and listen to the entire thing. With the exception of maybe two songs, I love the CD. Second time was much better than the first. Good job!!"
4,FutureSex/LoveSounds by Justin Timberlake,"I really like the beats on this CD. There were a few songs I could have done without, but other than that, I love the CD."
3,Justin's latest,"While there are a couple of cuts that rate high marks, (My Love and What Goes Around) this collection has a whining sound that lacks an appeal to a wider market. However, he is on his way to a sound that will be a benchmark in modern music if he can continue to develop more depth in his writing both musically and in the (spoken) word."
1,OK .......Justin there is ONLY one Prince and you're not him!,I think Justin spent way to much time trying to sound like Prince and Micheal Jackson and not enough time sounding like Justin. This CD is a poor crappy effert.
2,The Biggest Ego In the Buisness Is Back,"Here we have another offering by the biggest ego in the music buisness. As usual, his fans are rallying around him like he's the coming of the great pop Messiah. He's been called innovative and the biggest force in music today...yeah right. let's get a few thing straight.a) Timbaland and computerized beats exsisted before this...it is not innovative.b) Justin imitates MJ and Prince in his vocals...nothing innovative therec) Justin is ""hot"" so somehow, that converts to credibility, even if he recycles things thathave made music innovative in the past and then throw them all together.""Futuresex"" is yet another album of producer/his hop collaborations that make the public swoon. Why, I'll never know. This kid went from singing country on star search and doing childhood beauty pagents, to this. Get the right producers and anything is possible."
2,I'm Pretty Sure This Is The Music They Play In Hell,"Okay, that might be a teeny bit mean of me to say. Not all of Justin's stuff is bad. Some of it is pretty decent.However, SexyBack drives me crazy and I don't mean that in a good way. This is one of the most annoying pop hits I've ever heard.People tell me it's a lot of fun to dance to, but personally I'd have to be really really really drunk to enjoy dancing to it."
1,Worst Song Ever! (Sexy Back),"Sexy Back is jibberish. Singers could puke on a mic and their fans would buy it.. I wish they would quit playing Sexy Back on the radio. I still don't think people actually like this song, if you can call it a song."
5,Great Album!,One of the best albums.In my opinion every song was a HIT!JT out shined himself with this one!
4,timberlake,"pretty good over all, a lot of the music especially whats on the radio sounds all the same to me but still good some of the songs not yet released are quite fun"
4,Sexy is HOT!,"I must say that I was a little sceptical after seeing the title of this album, however, after listening to it I am totally hooked. Justin is so versatile and I think this album showcases that. I like all of the collaborations - they really work. Great effort!"
2,FS/LS = Falls short/long sigh,This album sounds like old 70s and 80s songs with dirty words thrown in to try and show that JT is all grown up. Sorry it just didn't work.There are a couple of good tracks but that's it.
2,Horrible,"This guy has no life, sexy this and sexy that sexy everything! Good club beat for ""Sexyback"" other than that this cd SUCKS!"
1,Disappointment,"Finally we got this album, but it was not up to what I anticipated. Overall it was just disappointing vocally and musically. Probably won't be playing this one much. Very disappointed in the lyrics too."
4,i love it!!!!,"i bought this cd about a month ago and i was veryy impressed! it took me awhile to get used to the music but now i jam to it in my car all the time! theirs an awesome mix of music on this cd. he has some slow songs, songs thats talk about his life and other peoples lives, and songs that make you just want to get up and dance! i recommend this cd to everyone!"
4,JT is All Grown Up,"I LOVE this CD! While his last CD Justified pays homage to Michael Jackson's sound, this one has Prince written all over it. I like every single song on this CD & that's rare these days. Justin & his producer Timbaland are a fantastic team & I hope they continue to work together in the future."
3,Just like the last album,"Just like the last album. Justin Timberlake and his crew release the good songs as singles. I cannot believe they got me twice. I got the album because I heard the song 'End of Time' on yahoo launch. Turns out I shouldn't have. With the exception of the last three songs on the album, and 'My love', the album sucks!"
5,JT IS BACK,"All I can say is, ""Studio 54 if we get the props right""~TimbalandI liked Justified, but I LOVE FUTURESEX/LOVESOUNDS. I like to dance (not booty shake, but actually dance), so this album is perfect for anyone who likes to dance. My FAVORITE TRACKS ARE: Love Stoned, My Love (the Interlude/Track), CHOP ME UP, What Goes Around & Losing My Way. I was very suprised & touched by Losing My Way. GREAT JOB JT."
5,Justin Time,"Just when we needed something great to dance to: here comes Justin Timberlake, who I can't believe was part of the bubblegum NSync crew, to whip it up real good.Here's my favorites list:SexyBack (didn't even believe it was him when I first heard it)Chop Me Up (oh, this is DA JAM ... ""please don't make a fool of me""!!!)Future Sex/Love SoundMy Love (a real banger! ""see, all I want him to do is be..."")What Goes Around (the beat ... the beat ... it's pure intoxication)Love Stoned (ohmygod)Sexy Ladies (whew ... can we take any more of the beat)Damn GirlLosing My Way(and trying to get all the ringtones I can get from this effort)Can do without Summer Love, Until the End of Time, All Over Again ... but they round the album out nicely. The first album was real good, but THIS ... superb.Don't buy it and you are certified crazy!"
4,A good sophomore solo album,"3.5 stars. Justin succeeded in releasing a CD that doesn't sound like what everyone else is doing, but no one is really doing the same thing from Christina (the twenties thing and dropping Storch)-to Furtado (dropped the whole earthchild vibe)-to Janet (musically hooking up with JD). The dance tracks are my favorites. Though MY LOVE hauntingly reminds me of Eminem 'Superman'. WHAT GOES AROUND of course makes you wonder if he's talking about his ex 'pop-queen'-which I'm sure was done intentionally. Sorry but I wasn't feeling CHOP ME UP or DAMN GIRL and the jury is still out on SUMMER LOVE and UNTIL THE END OF TIME. (Maybe they'll grow on me.) My interest pick back up on LOSING MY WAY ans ALL OVER AGAIN. Overall, it's still a decent CD worth a listen to."
5,On Time,"I grew up on Bobby Brown, BBD, and Guy. If you enjoyed them, you'll enjoy this. The beats alone would make this album go gold. I haven't even gotten past track #6 yet. #1 is as funky as My Prerogative. Plus J Tim brings solid vocals. No one can credibly say this album is not at least a low 4, especially compared to what else is out right now."
3,Not what I expected,I like Justin Timberlakes old sound! The CD is very different and in my opinion is mostly synthesizer and not J.T.
4,Suprised by Justin Timberlake,"This is a Cd that suprised me. I am not usually a Justin Timbelake fan. I wasn't greatly impressed with InSinc and wasn't greatly impressed by the work that Justin Timberlake produced after his Insinc Days, but I heard ""what goes around"" on the radio , didn't know who sang it and was suprised to learn that the artist was Justin. I had to have the CD. I never thought I would be writing a review praising Justin Timberlake, but I am. This is a nice CD. I greatly enjoy ""what goes around"", the words of ""losing my way"" make me think about my own way. There is a lot to like in this compilation. I also like the hip hop sound of ""sexy ladies"". ""Loved Stone"" has a really nice beat. If you have preconceptions about Justin Timberlake, do yourself a favor and listen to this CD. It might suprise you as well."
4,sarah_katiebeth,"Originally I bought this CD for just a few songs, but I have really enjoyed the whole thing. It's great for getting ready in the morning, it gets me going."
1,Perfect for Nickelodeon?,"I am shocked that the author of this explicit album hosted the Nickelodeon Kids Awards. This is inexcusable, and a huge failing for the network. Kids listen to TV more than they ever did their parents, and what is this teaching them? I am 22 years old and I know that when I watched Nickelodeon ten years ago they never would have allowed such a person to host the awards."
4,"Play On, Justin!","I like an Artist who isn't afraid to experiment. FutureSex/LoveSounds has the freshness that I've been searching for in music these days. Justin has always had a soulful flavor to me, but it's also his other flavors that I like. This album has a little R&B;, a little Pop, some Jazz, Hip-Hop, it's all there. I even heard some 70's disco flavor. A good effort, and Justin is an artist with some staying power. Very few albums stand the test of time but this album is filled with songs that have some relevance, something that you would listen to a few years from now and still feel the meaning.Actually, Justin doesn't need the featured artists (in ex: T.I.) but they don't detract from the album either. I happen to dig the title of the album and love his tight-fitting suit. This album is enjoyable from beginning to end."
3,Is it just me or......,"I first heard Justin's album on MTV's ""The Leak"" a few days before it came out. Although, I'm more of a JC Chasez fan than Justin, I found the album enjoyable.It's one of those albums you can sit back and chill to.There were only a few things that puzzled me though.#1)Did JC sing on the first song or did Justin just sound like him for a few meters?#2)No disrespect,but is it just me, or is Timbaland trying to turn Justin into the male version of Aaliyah? (Did anyone notice that in ""My Love""?)#3)Did a plane miss its landing and drop Justin in da hood for a second?Hmmm...I guess this album makes me ponder too."
1,Hip Hop & Rap Are Ripping The EDM Scene,"This is why hip hop, rap and r&b are sooo unoriginal! Leave the underground music alone and rip your mainstream friends instead. If you really can't think of any new ways of progessing Hip Hop, then maybe you need realize that you want to make underground dance music instead and that Hip Hop is dead."
2,"What happened, Justin?","Sorry, but i'm quite disappointed with this album, but more specifically, Sexyback.Justified was much better an album and Justin Timberlake's own style was apparent.This one however, i'm not sure what he's trying to do. Is he trying to bring out a new side of him? Or merely attempting to imitate trance-ish dance music? To me, being a regular listener of electronic music, Sexyback is a mediocre dancey/trancey type of track."
4,"Funky, Fun, and Oh Sooo Sexy...(4 1/2 stars)","Let me just say that from the beginning I planned on buying this album simply because I absolutely LOVE ""SexyBack""...but I can also say that I never really expected to like much more than that one track. Well, I was wrong. This album is so listenable and the fact that it is Justin Timberlake amazes me.... This new release is so far from where he started that it is mildly shocking. I was never into the whole boy band thing, but wowee Justin is millllleees from there now! It is a rare thing when I can listen to an album all the way through, but not only is it doable here - it is actually enjoyable. Justin Timberlake edgy...imagine that."
1,Awful,If this is what passes for 'music' nowadays then we are in more trouble than I thought.Ridiculous. Tired. Overrated. And that cover art is beyond stupid.
5,justin,I had already owned Justified. Saw Timberlake on SNL and really liked what he played. So it was the natural choice to get this cd. I was not dissapointed. Very smooth and hoppin on the dance tracks. Thanks again for the auction!
4,Very Unexpected,"I think most people when they hear Justin they automatically think of NSYNC. That makes many people reserved if not uninterested in an album from Timberlake.However, that said I think that this album is able to be catchy without that tiring pop quality effect. As other reviewers have stated even if the songs are not an instant hit with you, the songs do grow on you after a while.There's not too many albums out there that you can listen from beginning to end without having to skip a majority of songs. The nice mixture of slow and up beat songs make for an enjoyable experience.I think a lot of people would be surprised to learn that Justin has grown musically.I'd tell anyone to give it a chance."
2,Sounds like a bad 80's Prince rip off.,"If this album sounded original I would appreciate it however it sounds like a bunch of throw away songs from an old Prince CD called ""Sign O the Times."" Look it up. The singing style, music style are all prince sans guitar. At least he didn't steal his dancing style from prince, he got that from Usher, just like the style of his last CD. If it weren't for Timbaland there would be no originality at all on this CD. Really folks this guy's music was better when he was with NSYNC."
3,Disappointed,Why oh why was this re-released in the edited form??? If I wanted to buy this album edited I would have just went to Wallyworld!! I cannot figure out why this was edited....Very disappointing THIS IS NOT EXPLICIT LYRICS!!
5,Absolutely Fanstastic!!,"Can't say enough about this album. I like all but two songs on this CD. It is definitely a classic. I was not a fan of Justified. I figure, if you are going to pay money for a CD then at least most of the songs should be gems. That was not the case with Justified (and it's a good thing I didn't spend my dough on it). I bought FutureSex/LoveSound because of the song ""My Love"". I think that is an amazing song, and I just assumed it would be the best track on the CD. I WAS WRONG. I am absolutely addicted to ""Lovestoned"" and it is JT at his best. Amazing track. ""Chop Me Up"" is also great (""Got me cryin' rivers like Timbaland and Timberlake""). It would be easier to tell you what songs I am not into than the ones that I do like. Track #2 and the last song on the CD aren't my favorites, but I adore everything else on the CD. This CD is not a waste of money. In fact, it just solidies the fact that the Timbaland/Timberlake combo is a homerun."
2,Good CD,"This is CD is pretty good in everything except that it has explicit lyrics. Honestly, I hate dirty words so that is why I am giving it 2 stars out of 5."
1,Definitely NOT Sex/Love Sounds,"I absolutely cannot STAND Justin Timberlake. His girly voice makes me cringe whenever I hear it, and ""SexyBack"", while catchy, gets irritating after a while. Oh, and another thing, ""JT"": STOP COPYING MICHAEL JACKSON! MJ may be a freak, but at least he had talent. Don't buy anything from this loser. You'll thank me later."
3,"Well, its different","Like others have said, this is different. Less singing, good beats, more rapping. I only hear one radio friendly song on this cd-Sexy Back. The others are ok, catchy, but just not the typicle JT."
4,Pretty good CD...,"I am the type of person that buys a CD, then only likes one song on the whole thing. This CD though is pretty good- a lot of the songs sound similar, so I like most of the CD because that is the style I liked. Something funky and fun to listen to."
2,What's all the hype about?,Boring is the only way to describe this over produced and over hyped album.
4,Can't believe I like this album,"I've never been a fan of NSYNC, or Justin himself, but this album caught my attention. So I bought the cd and was thrilled to hear an artist taking risks, and being unique for once. He's fallen out of the boy band rut, and is making a name for himself. It's clear that he wrote this album trying to create something different and not just to please his fans, and in doing so has created new fans. I respect anyone who can try something new, and I love it when it actually works - and Justin, it works."
4,Listen all the way through!!!,"To my surprise I could listen to Justin's CD all the way through, which I can not say for many CD's I have listened to. There are a few songs that I want to skip @ times (I guess it has to do with my mood @ the time.) But besides those moody times I can listen to it all. I think he is very talented and the cd is wonderful!"
4,Great CD,"This is a great CD for the dance scene. Some of the songs remind me of JT's days with N'Sync - they have the N'Sync ""sound"", however, songs like Sexyback are unique and you can't help but want to dance to it. An essential for the dance collector's library!"
4,On The Pulse Of Today's Dance Music,"Justin Timberlake is talented and musicial, and with enough appeal that separates him from most artists attempting to make a dent in contemporary pop music. With Future Love/Sex Sounds, he has brought us a cool collection of dance and hip-hop, and most of the tracks are sexy, fun, vivacious, and very modern. His transformation is an fine example of his own growth as an artist, and has helped the former member of ""whatever that boy band was"" completely erase the bubblegum images of an earlier era."
5,"He'll be around for awhile, get used to it.","This album is just fantastic. Timbaland once again drops the album of the year, 2006 is definetely turning out great for him. JT is on top of his game better then ever in terms of knowing how to effectively use his voice. Anyone who reviews this and doesn't like it just shouldn't even review it at all, because you're holding on to some preconcieved idea of what you want music to be, and you're wasting the time of everybody who just wants an honest review. This album will win many awards, don't forget that."
3,ok then,"I understand that people enjoy this album. I myself like a lot of the tracks a lot and am impressed with timbaland's work, but I don't understand how people can rank this as one of the best when artists like michael jackson and prince did it much better and justin is ripping them off. I guess it's cooler to like justin cause he's younger but to say he's the best when he's really manufactured and works with a bunch of big names that produce most of his work and wardrobe for him is not fair."
5,Justin Rocks!,"When I first heard SexyBack I couldn't believe it was Justin Timberlake singing! Well, I fell in love with that song immediately and now love this album. It is unique and very modern. I enjoy the music and his lyrics.My favorite songs are What Goes Around (comparable to Cry Me A River), LoveStoned (like the lyrics...""She looks like a model, except she's got a little more *ss), and of course SexyBack (just a hot track).Also check out: Sexy Ladies Let Me Talk To You, FutureSexLoveSound, (Another Song) All Over Again, and really they are all decently good in my opinion. Some might require a few listens to grow on you but some are just HOT!Buy this album and make it number one on Billboard again!"
1,MUSICSTONED,"where's the no star option? for Godsakes, ppl need to get a grip and stop listening to bad music. what in the world is this exactly? if anyone calls this 'quality music' then that person has no ears for music whatsoever.this album is written by some of the socalled ""most talented writers"" in the music business today. so i guess these ""talented writers"" are horrible themselves then. if this is music and if JT is catagorized as ""talented"", then what are the real artists/bands such as celine dion, elton john, metallica, pink floyd??? gimme a break my ears are bleeding"
4,Best one yet!,"This is Justin's best CD. His sound is blended well with Timbaland and other artists. Good funky, r & b, and hip hop sounds."
4,ABOVE ADVERAGE,THIS CD WAS ALOT BETTER THAN HIS LAST ONE BUT IT WAS NOT THE BEST I'VE HEARD THIS YEAR. I BELIEVE THAT HE MADE VERY GOOD CHOICES WHEN COLABORATING WITH OTHERS AND THE BEATS ARE FRESH.
4,"Nature's Life - Bromelain Sinus Ease, 100 veggie caps",Shipped Immediately. Delivered ontime. Price is high.
3,What Happens After Korea...,"I'm a big fan of the TV series of MASH, but had not read the original book. This sequel has some funny scenes on the golf course and in the hospital. The story involves Hawkeye, now back in his home state of Maine, and his plans to reunite the 4077 MASH team there. The commentary on the local doctors and their lack of ability is scathing. The descriptions of Maine characters, behavior and speech patterns was sometimes baffling, but maybe my two summers in Maine hasn't been enough exposure to recognize the real Maine types shown in the book.If you want Maine humor, I'd recommend The New Saturday Night at Moody's Diner by Tim Sample."
4,Good book - wish it had more sites reviewed!,"This is a good book covering a large area. It gives thoughtful reviews of a handful of campgrounds for each of the 5 New England states - with 60 places reviewed. The descriptions are good giving hints as to which sites are secluded vs. open and which are more ideal. I would urge anyone using this (or any other book like it) to make sure to look up the campgrounds online as some have changed. For example, Mount Greylock Campground in Mass is now hike-in only. The author describes these as lug-in with a few having only 50 foot walks from the road. The Mt Greylock web site (Sept 2011) states that the sites require a 1.3 to 2.4 mile hike in depending on which site - as you must park at the parking lot on the map. This is not a criticism of the book - more a warning to folks out there to make sure you do additional research."
2,not so good tent camping,"my husband and i have used this book twice for tent camping in Mass. I'm not sure what the author has in mind regarding his idea of privacy but the two different parks we've stayed at, 4 stars for privacy was way off. I don't call 4 stars being able to talk to my neighbors from in front of my campfire less than 30 feet away with hardly any trees/bushes in between sites. His discriptions of the parks in general are accurate. We are very let down by the descriptions of the sites and privacy. We were suppsose to be ""on the river"" at Mohawk Trail State Forest but we had to walk through the next site to get to the river."
3,Only reviews the state owned campgrounds,"I was hoping this book provided recommendations for state owned and private campgrounds, but it does not. It holds a lot of information on the state owned areas which is extremely helpful. However, if you are looking for recommendations and info on private campgrounds in New England, you are out of luck."
4,Good love story,"Fillet does it again. Good story, compelling romance and ending with a twist. Worth a read. I gave this book four stars. Must read pillars of the earth as well."
4,Great author,"Keeps you in suspence the whole time, could not put the book down, as is with all his thrillers, bravo"
5,excellent,product was as advertised I enjoyed this book very much. It kept me interested throughout the story. Ken Follett writes well
4,Ken Follett - Lie down with lions,A good book - well written and fairly knowledgable about Afghanistan. Maybe a bit out of date and with a relatively uninspiring ending.
4,"Follett, number 20!","That then, is the 20th successive Follett book I have downloaded, keep writing Ken and onward to 21 !!! Ian"
3,cut to the chase,"this is one of the dumbest novels i have ever read but it has one of the most explosive sex scenes in the history of writing. the protagonists lie down in grass under the moon and make out marvellously and the author's descriptions are superbly graphic, intensely erotic and unabashedly provocative. this one scene is worth the price of admission. read this scene and unwind afer the worst day you've ever had at the office."
1,Vapid and weak. Literary Gruel.,"I cannot believe all the good reviews on this site for ""Lie Down with Lions"". It is truly an empty action novel with little to redeem it.To give the book some credit, the characters were well defined. Unfortunately they were two-dimensional and transparent. This is one of those novels where the villain is SO EVIL and the protagonist is a cartoonish superman. You can almost visualize the author rubbing his hands together between chapters, in rapture at how cool the protagonist is, but I found the character to be pathetically shallow and underdeveloped. If they made a movie out of this book, the hero would best be portrayed by Chuck Norris (and that's not a compliment).The author's world is again, a ridiculously over-simplified black and white world. ""Ooooo, those evil Russians! Thank God for America!""If you're a simple-minded American who likes vapid action with no real content (and apparently there are a lot of you), I'm sure you'll think this one is a classic."
2,Not my favourite....,"This is the first book I have ever read by Ken Follett, and it does not leave me begging for more. Seriously, this is one of the worst, most shallow, cheap-action-packed novels that I have ever read. The realness of this novel is ridiculous. It`s the same old American good guy/bad guy story all over again, and to me it is not that appeling. If this book ever made it to the movies ,then I`m sure that James bond would play the main character. I`m mean...who else could beat up five menn inside a helicopter while they are cuffed on both hands?"
2,a bit of a disappointment for Follett fans...,"Thin plot, thinly developed characters, not the author's best. The Pillars of the Earth, Eye of the Needle, and Dangerous Fortune stand out as by far his best. Lie down with Lions is interesting, but not nearly the suspense, drama or richly developed characters of Follett's best... not worth a read in my opinion."
4,Literature / history it's all the same,"I read the book again few days ago to make sure that I had not missed anything of importance the first time around. I hadn't. The book is a pleasant reading with sensual and real people that capture the imagination. Now my question is this. Why on earth did the author and/or the publisher allow this story to be ruined in a terrible movie? It would not surprise me if that movie didn't manage to turn hundreds of people off Follett for good. Still I am waiting for the next Pillars of the Earth, Eye of the Needle etc."
5,Lie Down with Lions,It kept my interest. I love the way Ken Follett expresses himself and the history. The story takes you into another world that was unknown to me.
2,found this one hard to get into,"i'm a huge fan of follet..some of his books are amongst my favorites by any author (dangerous fortune, place called freedom, code to zero, and of course the majestic pillars of the earth), but I just couldn't get into this one.It's not that I didn't like the characters. I liked the protagonist as well as the 'villains' of the book. I didn't like the setting much though.It takes place in Afghanistan during the early 80's when the locals are fighting against the russians for their freedom. I'm not really interested in the area or the setting so maybe that had something to do with it.I hate to say it but I had a hard time getting through this one. The chapters were very long which didn't help much either.There were some bright points to the book (as with all Follett books of course) but they didn't outweigh, what was to me, the boring story."
4,More Relevant Today than When Published,"Follett's masterful story of intrigue and complicated romantic relationships is set during the time of the Russian conflict in Afghanistan. The insight is even more relevant today as we have replaced the Russians. The reader will gain a deeper understanding of the tribal infrastructure and outlook. If you saw the poorly produced TV series, don't hold it against this book. It's the real deal and worth the read."
3,Okish,"The storyline is quite good it is interesting to wonder if the US hadn't helped to afghans, no 911? Pity about the soft porn halfway through just doesn't add anything to the story, typical follet flaw in many books."
2,"Too much ""romance"" & not enough intrigue!","I have enjoyed many of Ken Follett's novels in the past as he was always able to balance action, romance, and intrigue so well. Sadly, here it reads more like a romance novel set in a potentially intriguingly location. The female lead was incredibly hard to like and the ending was absolutely impossible not to see coming. I would still recommend Follett highly just not this piece."
3,"Not Follett's Best, but worth the read","I've read several Follett books now, and this one was just ok. I'm not sorry I read it, but it's not something I'll keep or really recommend.The Russian/Afghan conflict is an interesting one, and the CIA vs. KGB element is historically interesting. The spy story stuff and technology and hierarchy/strategy makes the story worth it. But the love story is not really convincing -- he doesn't really spend enough time developing the relationships involved for any of them to really pull at your heartstrings. The sex scenes, like in all Follett, are just awful! I really wish he's leave them out of his stories -- he so clearly likes writing them, but he's really bad at it!Overall, I wouldn't rush out to get this one, but if you run across it, it's worth reading. Solid 3 stars...."
4,A good adventure stoy...,That relates to world events now in 2004.A must read if you're into learning about Afghanistan and her people.A real page turner! See for yourself!
4,Lie Down With Lions,I read this book many years ago when it was first published but could only remember that it was about the Afghan war with Russia. I enjoyed it more this time perhaps because I am more familiar with the cities mentioned in the book. As always I find that anything Ken Follett writes will be a page turner that holds my attention
2,Disappointing,"Ken Follett is one of my favorite authors but ""Lie Down With Lions"" is little more than a predictable romance novel. Several times while reading it, I wondered if Follet was channeling Danielle Steele! The characters are one dimensional, uninteresting and totally predictable. The ""heroine"", Jane, is especially flat - more a male fantasy figure than a developed character. The best parts of the book are the Afghan characters and we barely get to know them. The ""hero"", Ellis, is a CIA undercover spy caricature as are the Russian ""bad guys"" and the French spy, Jean-Pierre. If you are expecting something of the same quality as ""Pillars of the Earth"" or ""Dangerous Fortune"" or even ""Fall of Giants"", you will probably be disappointed. This seems to be a grind-out novel to meet a publisher deadline instead of the gripping, well plotted novels with sharply drawn characters we've come to expect from Follett."
1,SO SORRY I GOT THIS!!!!!,"I cannot state enough how disappointed I am with this set..I got the deck and book and really dislike it very much...Sorry I didnt do more research into this thing..the deck is ghastly to look at - dull, muddy colors,horror-movie like images, & a weird numbering system (all her own, obviously!!) and totally worthless!! her meanings are things she must have dreamed up - they do not jive with the standard playing card fortune telling meanings - sorry I wasted my money!!!.I read about 3/4 of the text until I realized it was so off-putting I threw it aside...and there sits almost $30, wasted!!!.Think twice - no, 3 times - before even considering getting this awful set!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Dreamy,"The story line is very unique. It captivates you from page 1, and the hardcover book has beautiful designs on each page, it is worth keeping after you read it! You do not come accross dragon mystery/romance very often!"
4,Interesting and sensuous,Enjoyable series book two continues well written fantastic and rich. Recommend to romance fans and fantasy fans alike. Looking forward to book three.
2,Major Disappointment,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. I read the Smoke Thief and loved it. Unfortunately, other than the last quarter of the book, this was just boring. The only redeeming feature was a new and interesting character who was intoduced in the final quarter of the book. If you want to read it, I'd suggest you borrow it from the library. It is not worth the money."
4,trilogy,"I read the whole trilogy (The Smoke Thief, The Dream Thief and Queen of Dragons). I thoroughly enjoyed them all. They left me wanting more. I loved the story line. I did, however, feel they were incomplete. I recommend the entire trilogy."
3,Not as good as first book,I loved the first book in this series so I was expecting a lot from the second one. It was not as engaging as the first and I found myself bored very quickly without the fast pace of the first book. I won't say it was a complete waste of time as it did give more background information on the race of Dragon. Hopefully any more books in this series will be more action packed and more interesting.
5,Great,"I bought it today and finished it today. Great book, couldn't put it down. I think the character development was better than the first book. Can't wait to go buy the third one tomorrow!"
4,Pretty good,"This book was not as good as the first, but was still good. I am anxious to see what happens next!"
1,this does not work with Treo 650,"I bought the card for use with a Treo 650 and I thought it was the phone that had issues. After a month of trying to trouble shoot the phone I happen to try a friend's Sandisk 1 gig card for laughs to see if it would work. Hello and behold it works fine ! then I tried a MMC card and that worked great in my Treo as well !! It looks like this cards is not compatible with all devices !! The product discription does not mention this at all. Now it's going to cost me about $20 buck in restocking fee and shipping with Amazon to return it. I guess the lesson learned is don't buy electronics with Amazon unless you are absolutely sure of what you are getting, even then look around locally so you can try it before buying."
1,Beware!,"The photograph accompanying this ball made it appear much larger than it proved to be. I returned mine, as I had expected a much larger one."
1,Cost too high,$38 devided by 5 pounds is over $7 a pound of candy. Are you serious? These Sunkist candies can be found at any grocery store that has a bulk asile. I just bout a pound for $2.97 a pound. Had I bought 5 pounds I would have spent $14.85. So why would you pay close to $40 on Amazon? Crazy to me.
5,GREAT!!!!,I loved this book! I recognize myself in Ned. He is like me and my friends. Everyone should buy this book. It is GREAT!!
1,Oh my Gosh!!!,"Now I know why Sweden isn't famous for their prolific litterary heritage. All I can say is, if a quarter of the swedish population think this is a good book, then Sweden better open some more Mental Homes."
4,Good book,I liked this book. It was very suspensful but didn't have the expected amount of romance as the previous Undead books.
2,Not the best in this series.....,"I was very disapointed in this installment of the Unded and... series as the plot seemed to go nowhere, rather it was a vehicle to set up further books. Eric had one or two shining moments, but this is not the authors finest work. Perhaps she was rushed to print by our pleas for more Betsy and Sinc-lair? Hoping for better next time."
3,Waaaaaay too short,"This was the first of this series that I have read. There was enough explication that I didn't need to worry about jumping into the middle of the series, however, had I been reading the whole series up to this point, I would have probably thought that there was too much time spent on back-story.The plot was very thin. There was much more time spent on wedding talk and sexual tension between characters than there was story. The mystery of the driveway murders was an afterthought.If you're looking for a superfast, all fluff read - this is your ticket. I have read lots of wonderful things about the first book so I might try it."
2,Unreturnable....,"Undead and Unreturnable is an interesting choice of titles for this book, because I had a strong desire to return the book to the store. I have really enjoyed MJD's first few books in this series, but on three and now four things are heading downhill.The main plot of this book is...I'm not really sure. From the blurb on the back one expects an interesting story because of a ghost wandering through the mansion and a serial killer on the loose. The ghost basically hangs out making snide comments and patiently waiting for Betsy to get past another minor romatic snafu with Sinclair and then helps Betsy and Laura solve the entire mystery in about a chapter. No build up, no drama, no mystery.The dialogue between the characters was, as always, amusing, but that alone could not carry the book. For those that have enjoyed the earlier volumes, I would strongly recommend waiting for the paperback. At something closer in size to a novella, you should save your money."
3,Undead and Unreturnable,This was okay. Not my favorite. It was really choppy. A lot of things were not explained I thought. I liked seeing Betsy's nicer side though. It was a nice break from all the complaining.
5,Tons O' Fun,"Again, just fabulous. I love these books. They really are genuinely clever and what fun to read. Betsy is hilarious!"
3,Christmastime for Betsy,"It's Christmastime for Queen Betsy and the gang, and she's in for yet another rough week. She's trying to plan a wedding (which her fiance may or may not want to go through with), figure out how to tell her beloved she can hear his thoughts during sex, get to know her half-sister (who happens to be the daughter of the devil), and baby-sit her half-brother (while not killing his mother). Oh, and figure out another streak of murders plaguing the St. Paul area.The series is still a fun piece of fluff, but this book didn't quite have the pizazz of the previous installments. Maybe it was Sinclair being all mopey (when he wasn't screwing Betsy's brains out), or maybe it was the ever-annoying Jon. I don't know. I'll still keep reading the series (heck, I've blown through the first four books in 48 hours), and have my eye on one of Davidson's other series, The Alaskan Royal Family."
3,not quite yet,"I really like this series the potential it has, however, the last two books have been lacking. I like this book more than the 3rd, there is more of a story here, but not by much.Detective Nick never panned out and he's used in the description of this book, but other than seeing his name there isn't much more than two paragraphs where the character is actively involved.There are some good characters here, but none of them are really fleshed out and enhanced. Many of them are diminished in order to provide more air time to others. Justin, I think is just a waste, mostly because of the age and the imaturity to which he written, to my mind there is not conflict for Sinclair and Justin, because Jusin is so young.I don't mind the collecting of characters, but they're being used here in place of a good story.One last thing, the timeline of when all this stuff happens, I think is actually only 3 days, but it seems longer."
3,i kinda liked it,i went to the book store right away to get this book. i read it fast but i think i liked it. it did not have that flame the other undead books have but it had meaning and was a good book. if you are a fan of MJD and of her undead books i would say read it becase it shows more about sinclair and betsy and how there love is. it had its funny parts and well it was kinda boring at most of it. i could put that book down any time i wanted to becase it did not hook me in that much. but i was a good book.
3,What Happened MaryJanice?,"The answer to that question is in the acknowledgments. She thanks Laurell K Hamilton ""thanks for showing me how it's done.""MaryJanice, take a look at Laurell's writing now and please see that she doesn't make her readers happy any longer. This, I'm afraid, is going to be your fate if you keep writing like this. This book was missing the plot, sarcasm and adventure that your other books starring Betsy have had. I see the sex is starting to take up a lot of pages though. Good thing I bought the hardback for $5 on a used site instead of paying full price..."
1,Is this a bad year for MJ Davidson?,"The books are nowhere near the caliber of the first two books. The storyline and the content of the writing is going downhill at an astronimical speed. I returned the 3rd book and now I think I'll return this fourth one. It's getting worse not just humorwise, but content and character-wise as well. Seems the author resting on the laurels that the first two books were good enough not to put the effort to write decent books from there on out."
2,Main character is tired,"I had to read this installment to keep up with the series but was disappointed with the progression of the characters and the overall plot of the book..... it was definetly a dash between the last installment and the new one. Betsy is annoying and I often look forward to reading the other characters then her. The sex I always liked in the books but in this installment it was not caring and unaffectionate. It was not ravishing and yerning but just a way to end or fill in a chapter.I wish the main character was stronger, her opinion makes no sense and have no ground based on her insecurities from her pre-dead life. It is like she is an idiot that was crowned queen. No wisdom, no sicerity, no back bone(unless you care for her, then she will treat you bad or go against your better and more wise judgement)Everyone is more understanding of her whole situation then she and it get boring. I love all of the other books and was sadden with this installment"
2,Stale Read,"I, like a lot of other fans of MJD, eagerly awaited this last novel, hoping beyond all hope that it would be a bit better than the last. I like the Undead series, and have even read a few of her other stories, but find them to be the same characters, over and over again. Betsy in herself, is a likable character, but a whole book filled with the same type left me feeling rather let down and a bit punch drunk as if I had watched Shakespere performed by the Three Stooges. The storyline was non existent and it felt as if the concept was ""rushed."" I only wish the plotline was as snappy as the comebacks. The book is filled with characters who seem to have little more to do than simply walk through the house. My advice, reread one of the earlier books, and wait on the paperback. This one isn't (in my opinion) worth the $$$."
4,Undead and Unreturnable,I liked it! Had a few spots where it dragged! But it was still a very funny book.
2,disappointed,"I was hoping for so much more with this book, but alas, I'm disappointed. I felt as if this story had absolutely no plot and the characters' true selves didn't even shine. Tina and Marc are barely in the picture. Jess is less than sarcastic and Sinclair is not nearly as maddening as he has been in past books. There just seems to be so many sub-plots under-developed in this story and the flow was completely off. I know we are all excited for a new book to be released, but we would prefer to wait for quality work, Mrs. Davidson. If book five is anything like this one, you will be losing a loyal reader."
3,"Good, but I expected more","Funny and fluffy, this book was enjoyable, but didn't have a lot in terms of story progress. I would have liked a bit more to happen in the course of the book.Note: I also posted this review on Goodreads."
4,Continues to deliver enjoyment,This book series is good. It isn't great it is good. I have to say on a scale of 1-10 I'd give it a 7. I wish amazon did half stars because I would say its 3.5 but unfortunately I have to give it a four.The series continues to deliver humorous moments and enjoyable characters but each fail the mark in some manner. You want more from the characters but they just don't deliver it. Will I continue to read the series? Yes. They are enjoyable but they could be better.We all have room for improvement but this series has a little more then most.
5,woot!,got the book super fast!! was so happy to see it was brand new!! :P loved it!! will definitely buy from ya'll again!
3,Mixed feelings on this series,"The Good: Story line (unique, entertaining). Likable secondary characters. Quick and mindless reading for those times you want a light read. Some funny spots.The Bad: The dialog (too many barbs, insults, sarcasm)and irksome overuse of periods (Irksome. Overuse. Of. Periods.)The Ugly: Excessive foul language."
3,Not one of the best in the series,"I really like the Queen Betsy books, they are fun, light reads. However, this one only rated 3-star from me because it seems like the plot got lost in all of Sinclair (Betsy's sexy fiance) and Betsy's constant arguing. There wasn't a whole lot going on besides that, the whole serial killer thing was maybe a chapter in the book and wrapped up with barely any drama at all. There is the set-up (for future books I'm sure) of Betsy's half-sister starting to lose her good-girl ways and turning toward her darker side (compliments of her mother, the devil).Worth the read just to keep up with what's going on in this series, but not one of the best."
3,Adequate reading,"I have to agree with most readers that in the Queen Betsy Series, the best books are ""Undead and Unwed"" and ""Undead and Unemployed."" The other books are satisfactory, but not particularly exciting."
1,Disappointing,"I loved the first three books, apparently I loved the sexual tension between Eric and Betsy. The fourth book fizzled with a loud zzzzzzzzz. I was just annoyed throughout with the cliches, and it didn't keep me hooked."
1,Slightly annoying,"I usually would briefly summarize the plot in my reviews, but there really isn't one to write about. It feels like a ""days of our lives"" soap opera of Betsy's life...she and eric are in love, she and eric have a fight, then she and eric make up, re-wash and rinse. I wouldn't mind this as much except Betsy is getting more annoying with each book. I keep waiting for her to grow up and be more queenly. Her though process is like a 13 year old, and I just want to shake her and tell her to grow up. I feel like the author is making Betsy more immature so that she can put Betsy in sillier situations (that anyone with a brain can figure out in 2 minutes) to get a cheap laugh from the readers. This is one book in the series that you can skip without loosing anything.To be honest, I truly think Betsy's demon sister is a better character to read about. Maybe the author could do that after Betsy's story fizzles out...like the next book."
2,Mary what have you done????,"The last 2 books, and the short stories are just not the same Betsy I fell in love with. After books 1&2 I had to read all the MJD books I could find, and I liked a few of the other books. But Betsy was my fav. Untill I got the 2005/2006 books(I only buy paperback) I find them to be rushed, and fall WAY short. If you want a good read try the Southern Vamp books by Charlaine Harris or the Stephanie Plum books by Janet Evanovich. Both are put out just as fast and the books keep getting better and better. I am not sure if I will get the next undead book now, to bad for the queen she will be missed."
2,Glad I waited for the library to get it.,"I bought the first ""Undead"" book on a whim, and loved it. I bought the next 2, even when MJD ""upgraded"" to hardcover. Now I'll just wait until the library gets books in the series. The latest ""novel"" (it's almost a short story) was a disappointment. Betsy is getting tiresome, the characters aren't showing any growth, there's not that much humor any more, and there doesn't seem to be a good solid plot.I won't be buying any more books in the series. They're overpriced in hardcover and there's not much to them. If you can, wait for a library copy."
1,Glad I just borrwed this and didn't by it,"Wow...talk about no storyline. I thought the book would be more of a mystery with the serial killer storyline. That storyline...mentioned a couple times and quickly resolved near the end of this very very short book. Honestly, I found that the constant swearing and bickering seemed to get to me. There didn't appear to be a plot...just a bunch of random things thrown together. I will try another one from the library before I commit to buying and of MaryJanice's books."
2,If you like TV sitcoms ...,... that revolve around the social lives of female airheads then you will love this book!
4,Love is all that matters.,"The theme that we are all spiritual creatures first and foremost is played throughout 1-800-GOD-HELP-ME: A Love Story. A love story it is ... Michael Farkas writes about his angels' reminders that love is the most important thing in our existence. Love is the only thing that matters. Because we are all spiritual beings, learning the lessons of love develops our spiritual selves which we take with us even after our current mortal existence is over with. Planet earth is like a huge 'schoolhouse' where we are supposed to learn to love others as well as ourselves. In this book, Angel reminds us that love transcends all."
4,"Wow, this book has impact!","If you are in need of refocusing or reprioritizing, this book will be very helpful. I was able to peel away layers of baggage and see myself more clearly - past, present, and future. By becoming more creative with my life, (starting off small and then expanding), I've discovered a more secure feeling of contentment. I believe many people will find this book very fulfilling."
5,I am the walrus: koo-koo-ka-choo,This is an excellent history of microscopy and biological science. It is difficult to find. Amazon has been a good source of books like this for me.
5,Decent Kids Movie,Working without any major stars and a low budget the filmakers of Let's Sing Again do a good job at making a musical aimed at kids.As with most muscials the plot is simply an excuse to get the action moving. It's about a kid who runs off to join the circus and along the way learns to sing and dance and becomes a star.You don't get a lot of preaching and the songs are very humable.
2,A Gift from Zeus,"A lovely retelling of classical mythology, but should hardly be included among ""children's books."" To begin with, as another reviewer has noted, the illustrations are a bit too ""irreverant."" Descriptions of how Daedalus fashions a wooden cow for his queen to enjoy a sexual encounter with a bull seems far too adult a subject for an intended audience of 9-12 year-old readers. I had bought this book intending to read it with my six-year-old son, but it will be a few more years (quite a few) before he will see it. I am just not ready to explain to him what ""ravish"" means. I am very familiar with classical Greek mythology and should have known better than to have bought a book of it for a child. However, its being included in Amazon's children's section convinced me that it would be ""safe."" This book would be better classified as ""teen"" or some such. Not for children."
1,Written by your stogie smokin' leering Uncle ...,"I applaud the idea of bringing myths to young people. I deplore this choice.There are dozens of myths that would be more understandable and certainly more interesting than Electra lusting over her father. The Steigs probably feel they put one over on us; they told some mildly dirty stories and got attention from people who feel children need to be introduced to the classics. As another reviewer observed, the obvious omission of Hercules gives a clue as to their priorties.Bleah.If you want your kids to learn the myths, go get D'Aulaires."
2,Partial Manual which can be found online,"As the other reviewer stated, this is only a partial manual! I got the full manual through an Inter Library Loan which had a lot more information in it and was about 3 times as thick.Also, the abridged manual can be found online for free: [...]I would suggest not spending the money on this particular version."
2,Meh,"I did not enjoy this game. I found the rules to be overly complicated... even for such a game. I love to play more intricate games like Runebound, Arkham Horror, and Fury of Dracula. These all have detailed rules that can be potent... in my opinion, these were beyond that. And I didn't believe that gameplay made up for it as I didn't find it to be fun.The pieces are good sturdy pieces, but that also made them very challenging to ""punch out""... although technically I had to carefully cut each plastic piece... even then I found them hard to cut. But they are sturdy and will last some time.I felt the game moved slowly and didn't offer what some of my other games offered. I was sad that I bought it. If you like other games by this publisher, you might enjoy this game a lot. I unfortunately regretted having purchased it and gave it away to someone who was excited to receive it."
5,Shaun is an amazing child of God,This is a great read for anyone pursuing a faith journey. I'm buying it for all my teenage family members. It tells of being obedient to God brings about good life choices and a happier life.
5,I felt like I should have paid the author for a class.,The book is like taking a college course. The author is very good at explaining the information. He uses examples for most of the material. After reading the book I felt like I could someday reach financial serenity.
5,A Good Book for Starters and Advanced Investors,"This book provides intuitive information in an easy to read style covering various financial topics. It explains the fundamental investment techniques and basic information for individuals to make sound financial decisions in their life. The book provides adequate examples and covers all the options available to investors and how certain reasoning should be used for one's financial preferences. The author informs the reader the necessary steps in building a successful financial plan with a focus on long-term investing.Highly recommend the book to any individuals, either for starters or more advanced readers to review the many financial decisions people ponders throughout their lifetime."
4,How too get MSCE fast,"This book gives you all you need to pass the MCSE test, it fills you in and the exams stuff can be used in real life as well. I recommend it To ALL who need MCSE."
2,Get a Great certification chance to become an MCSE,"This book is a great opportunity to get all the certifications you need fast, and it covers the most subjects very widely. It is not only for the exams, it is something that you can use in the real life after graduation the exams. Very well easy to understand and I'll recommend it to ALL who need some certifications fast."
4,A big luscious read!,"This book was first published in 1991 and it's taken me 10 years to discover it in an op-shop.It's a good read about a minor aristocratic family between WW1 and WW2 and is slightly reminiscent of ""Love in a Cold Climate"" by Nancy Mitford.Cousinly feuds are fought and forays into love affairs begun--some with tragic results.I found it to be a totally absorbing read and one which I can unhesitatingly recommend to lovers of family sagas. DO try to find a copy if you can and you won't be disappointed--I promise."
1,Lots of bugs - look elsewhere,"playing discs with mp3 files is very buggy - can't navigate, locks up frequently. No point in using a DVD for MP3 files - it takes too long to ""load"" Won't play a Hollywood DVD but will play home burnt DVD's without any menus - go figure.More trouble than its worth - look elsewhere"
2,What is contained in this book.,"Contains 273 illustrations under topics: Biography, history, Natural history, Travels manners & Customs, world illustrated, useful arts & manufacturers, trees plants fruits, great inventions, mining, wonders of the sea, familiar science, law for the masses, statistical & misc. Index."
5,Fun Filled,"Asprin continues with his pun-filled world of Deevils, Perverts...err...Pervects, and other assorted characters of an odd nature. However, this time he adds two interesting new characters. One is a young child whom Skeeve wins in a card game. As the player who lost didn;t have the money to pay, he leaves Skeeve with a marker - hence the title of the book. The other is Bunny, Skeeve's appointed moll from the Fairy GodFather. Both characters set forth to wreack havoc on Skeeve and his gang of friends in a variety of ways that remains delightful."
3,My least favorite of the series but still good.,Not as much action in this one in that it all takes place in the bazaar as opposed to Skeeve being chased through alternate dimensions. It wasn't as funny as the others but it was still good. For it's length it was worth it. I don't think I would have enjoyed it if it was a lot longer.Asprin has created the most unforgettable set of characters I can think of. I feel like I have lived with these characters all my life (but I guess I almost have considering I started reading them years ago).
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Best card game ever.Dragon poker, that is. You should give it a try some time. That is, if you can actually manage to keep track of some of the rules. Anyway, while that may be fun, actually winning a kid as part of a game is not so much fun, at least if you are the ones lumbered with looking after the little brat."
4,"Great Value, Beautiful.","I read another review about the white version of these and was horrified the buyer wasn't happy. I bought the white ones for a friend who is over the moon, and the black ones for myself and my mother. These are freshwater pearls so there is some irregularity with them, both in color and shape. It's part of their beauty. This necklace is a lovely length, and the pearls are a good size. It's got those really pretty petrol colored green and purple tinges, as well as a nice wieght to it. If you've got a few spare $1000 and are after 18mm tahitian pearls, then don't buy these. If you're after a very pretty necklace you'd be proud to be seen in and want people to comment on, then these are for you. I'm going to buy some of the other colors."
2,It was ok!,"The shipping was great it got here in no time, butttttttttt the necklace left something to be desired. It was rough and had gouges. It still looked great from afar. I think it was a ok buy, but for 20 dollars i can live with it."
4,Great deal for the $,"The pearls are just as described, fast shipping and nicely packaged. Even came with a nice storage bag."
5,Christmas Gift,These were a Christmas gift for a good friend a few years back of mine and she absolutely loved them and she still wears them.
3,Nice for $,"These are not top of the line pearls nor do they feel as such, but they are nice for the price. Make sure you have a general idea about neck sizes because these could be a choker on some."
4,Mirror Ball & Silver Star,"OK. So this Four Seasons album is a departure from their earlier works but for it's genre it is no less a classic. As the Seasons embraced the age of disco their combined harmonies were eager to be exploited by the sounds of the burgeoning dance rhythms of the mid seventies!It's difficult to find the track ""Silver Star"" on any current compilation of the band and I would recommend this album for this track alone. However, we are also blessed to get: Who Loves You, December 1963 (Oh What a Night) and Harmony Perfect Harmony."
5,Made the coffee!!,"Finally I found a coffee pot to suit my needs!! My employee broke the other two we had so I had to buy two more, glad I got these!!"
5,Stan Kenton Christmas,I love Stan Kenton Big Band Music. I know I will love this. Waiting for the holidays to play it.
5,Best Yet,I've purchased a lot of Stan Kenton music over the years. This Christmas album of instrumental music is one of his best and probably one of the best Christmas albums I've heard. Even better than Manheim Steamroller.
3,Kenton Christmas revisited,"I have owned the old LP for years.When wondering why I never playedit any more, I heard the wholealbum again last Deceember. Then itcame back to mind why this is atedious set. It was arranged andperformed without any reeds. A saxsection was always a key part ofthe Kenton orchestra. I'm a brassplayer, but brass only on a recorddate gets boring very quickly.update: February 28, 2009It seems I was too critical of thisKenton Christmas album. There arefour or five tracks on the album Ireally enjoy. Besides, the re-issueincludes the fabulous ""Christmas forModerns,"" by the Maynard Ferguson band.That makes this album worth gettingfor fans of big band Christmas music."
5,great christmas music,"A friend of mine plays in a band that performs some of these pieces at Christmas, and this recording is almost as enjoyable is hearing my friend in a live performance"
5,Sounds from the old days,"What a great album!! My wife, a classical music lover, played this over and over during the holidays. GOOD STUFF...like the old days."
2,not opaque enough,"I did not feel that these tights were truly opaque. They were reminiscent of pantyhose. Nice control, but not opaque."
3,"Too densely knit, not enough stretch","These tights are my size but are not comfortable to put on or to wear because the fabric is so dense. I don't know how to explain this any better except to say that it doesn't have enough ""give.'"
1,NOT Opaque,"Shipped very quickly, but not at all opaque. These are completely sheer and SO thin! I'm really disappointed in these ""opaque"" tights!"
1,not a good costume wig,"The quality of this wig was low. It had patches of baldness and the material of the ""hair"" was awful. There was even a spot of hair that seemed to be melted together. I will not buy here again."
2,A Total Mess,"We got this wig along with the Danny wig and they were both unfortunately a total mess to wear and try to work with. We ended up not wearing either of them. I really have to believe that the photos taken for the product photos are a totally different wig. Of course I am not expecting a whole lot out of a cheap wig, but the photos of the product were definitely deceiving. Unfortunately you can't return wigs due to sanitary concerns."
4,From a Gill student,"David Gill's books can be a bit academic. At times you really have to want it to get through the books. But if you can do it, there is great wealth to be found.I have experienced Gill as a professor and in his classes his passion emerges. He also teaches secular companies ethics, so don't pidgeon-hole him as some theologian with no relevance. He teaches secular companies ethical models that have people coming to him afterwards asking where he gets his insights from...and are surprised to find they are based on the 10 Commandments and/or The Beatitudes.Gill is a well-rounded man with irons of philosophy (esp. Jacques Ellul), theology, ethics, and secular reasoning in the fire.He is worth a read if you have the time. I endorse him heartily."
3,Doing Right,"*** It is the contention of many, even many ""good"" people, in the post modern world that the Decalouge, the Ten Commandments, is outdated, written in a time when there was less grey area in life than there is now. Perhaps those contenders merely need the Ten Words of God to be explained to them a bit better. By taking each of them and expanding upon it to illuminate the meaning how it relates specifically to the modern world with its varigated problems that no one in the Pre Christian Sinai wilderness could have imagine, the author proves that the law of Moses is as timeless and relevant as it ever was- perhaps even more so. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
1,A good concept in theory,"A good concept in theory.... but the book is written like some sort of painful academic semester project. No ""character"" emerges ironically from the author. He seems to be rather pretentious. I suggest you ignore this kind of nonsense posing as serious theology amd get down with someone like Brendan Manning, or John Eldridge, or even that ""Blue Like Jazz"" guy. Even if they are flawed at times, they are at least real people, with a message that is relevent to real people."
4,Great to hear Toni and Daryl again,"This album is a welcome addition to the collection of any Captain and Tennille fan. The production is pretty bare bones though. Toni's voice though, is in great shape, and at times better than in her heydey. It has gained an earthy and confident edge, if it sometimes lacks her earlier subtlety. I think the album features the sound that could only be heard while listening to C & T live in the past. Where are ""Shop Around"" and ""Lonely Nights""? I guess they didn't fit the theme.Please Toni and Daryl, put out another CD soon. A longtime fan."
2,Vegas Show?,"If you are looking for a compilation CD of the old hits, this isn't it. These are their songs redone along with ""standards"" Toni's voice is gone in my opinion. This is for people who liked their Vegas show."
3,A disappointing album,"I was excited by the ""new"" songs on this disc, but I wish I had known before buying it that it included re-recordings of the older tracks (guess I should have checked Amazon before buying it). It's great to hear C&T again, but for my first C&T CD, I was disappointed I didn't get any of their hit recordings, only re-recordings."
2,average,songs like Love will keep us together were alright 20 years back.but for the most part the music of Captain&Tennille is very dated and Lounge Material at best.a more Sopisticated duo than Sonny&CHer.catchy but forgettable as well.
1,Shudder,"I shudder whenever I think of the song ""Muskrat Love"" which is one of the worst songs of all time. By comparrison the rst of this stuff is just horrible. Why, people, why?"
2,its ok,"the toy has beautiful paintjob, but the flaw is that you cant move the arms or legs its the only figure i know that trish has."
4,Muy buen Cd del Gallo,"Muy buen trabajo de Tito que nos sigue deleitando con la fuerza de su musica, por eso es uno de los mejores salseros del momento.-"
5,Healing Helper,"""Pieces of Pie"" breaks your heart open over and over again and brings you down into the depths of human suffering with a parachute of forgiveness and compassion. A true healing piece of art. Kelly McCoy"
3,"A little bit closer to the ""truth"".","Millard's book is informative, yet still missing that ""edge"" I am hoping for in the forthcoming book by George Mair. It's as if these authors refuse to step on the might JUDD TOES. Come on, now, let's get down to the TRUTH about the Judds. These are REAL PEOPLE with REAL SKELETONS in their closets. Let's get down to it!"
1,BOO!!!!!!,This is the worst movie ever! It was shot with a video camera in some deserted office building. I bought this movie because it was rated 4-star and it never should have been.
1,A piece of JUNK!!!,I do not understand why every review rates high this piece of JUNK. I do not recommend it for my worst enemy. I would not pay a buck on it. Save your money because if you buy it you will regret!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Interesting...,"This volume contains the famous transcriptions of the Chopin Etudes. The transcriptions can be extremely difficult to master, but also highly rewarding. You should also obtain a nice recording, in order to fully appreciate their technical difficulties.It's good to have this book in your collection, even if you never manage to play an etude. Once and again I have a look at mine and try a few bars.The book itself is well made and legible, although it's rather thick."
4,The best available,"I love this book, kind of a journal/scrapbook all in one. I search high and low for the best one for my pregnancy and even though it is high pricd I splurged on this one. I loved it so much I just bought one for my sister who is pregnant. Why did I give it only 4 stars? Well to be perfect it would have been great to have ability to add or remove pages, and some bright color choices would be nice. I am not a huge fan of pastels and when you are pregnant you do not know the sex of the baby yet, so it was hard to choose a color. Overall loved the internal pages, wished they would take you all the way through the baby's first couple of years too."
3,Item is not as described...,"I ordered this item for my son's bedroom after reading under Amazon's Product Review that it consisted of two rod pocket panels and a valance. When I received the item, the package clearly states ""Valance Not Included"". Still a cute item, but definitely not as described."
2,I was disapointed in this book.,I felt that this book had very little substance and did not do a good job on any one area of Mexico. The book actually repeated three of the chapters a second time!
2,Didn't fit.,I bought this for the main double din outer plate to go around my Pioneer AVIC Z2. Apparently it doesn't come with that part. It is designed for putting a single din stereo into a double din compartment. It is not designed for putting a double din stereo into a double din compartment.
3,book,"I just needed this book for class. It took a while to actually get here, but it's here, I got it at a cheaper price than the book store, so that's all that matters. Besides, we haven't even started reading it yet."
5,life goes on,"This book is about the siege of Ramallah and Shehadeh tells a heartbreaking story, with plenty of villians to go around. I expected that. To my surprise, what makes the book worth reading are the heroes. Not the Isreali soldiers. Not the PLO. Not Islamic Jihad or Hamas. The heroes of this book are the everyday people who actually try to live a normal life in the West Bank."
4,An Hour from Paris,"This book is ideal for people living in Paris who like to explore the less well-known and touristy parts of this wonderful city, or just like to get away from the crowds and city living every so often.The book is well organised, with a great summary map at the front with a diagram of all the trips, which direction they are in, which metro to leave from, how long the train takes to get there, and which page the details are on.It is a great size (not too big and heavy so you can take it with you to read on the train on your way)."
5,For anyone interested in how popular culture affects society,"This book is an excellent critical look at the intersections between popular science, sexuality, and Star Trek. The first section looks at the dialogic interaction between the fiction of Star Trek and the reality of NASA. It is fascinating both for those interested in the history of women in the US space program and for Trekkers, giving little known facts about NASA and providing insightful, well-written analysis. The second half of the book analyzes slash fan fiction, using actual stories and images to explore how and why women express their own utopian longings through the sexual relationship of Kirk and Spock. Penley's book is thouroughly researched, clearly presented, and well-written throughout."
2,Outer Space Bird Feeder,I liked the idea of this feeder. When I put it up I did not get many customers. The birds liked the other feeders I had up. Would not recommend this item for purchase to anyone.
1,not squirrel proof,"I had the Garden song bird feeder about 1.5 weeks and I found the entire content of seed on the ground one morning. Squirrels had clawed and bit through the detented thumbhold pryer spot and pulled the top away tearing the plastic. I now use the feeder using several layers of duct tape around the whole circumference. Product testing was not done or done sketchily, squirrel proofing should be gauranteed. Why not thread the top on to the bottom,or hold it together with plastic clamps?"
4,This works OK?,"Nice big size, easy to fill, birds love it but the hanger came off the first time I filled it and have had to repair it with a knot and tape???"
5,"cheap, durable, easy to use","The title says it all. So many ugly bird feeders cost $40 and up. Why spend so much for so little? This feeder and others made by Garden Song look nice in my backyard and are easy to refill. Also, very little seed is dropped by the birds and the squirrels seem unable to break into the feeder."
2,"Great feeder, but squirrels will get to it","At first, we loved this bird feeder too. It's everything the other reviewers say it is. However, a squirrel in our tree has figured out if he ""dives"" down on the feeder, the top-lid will jar loose and the seed will go all over the ground.If you even *think* you have squirrels, please consider getting another feeder. Otherwise, this product is great."
2,Not the quality I expected,"I thought this would be a little higher quality for the price. The plastic is very thin. I would compare the clear plastic to that of a soda bottle. I guess I'll see how well it holds up to the New Hampshire winter. I'm impressed that even though it's full of about 3 lbs of seed, the little hanging cable didn't break even with 8"" of snow on top of it. I bought a second feeder which is mostly metal at Lowes for similar money."
2,"Birds liked the seed, but squirrels ate the feeder!","Nothing really wrong with the feeder--easy enough to fill and hang, but it's pretty flimsy plastic, and the clever squirrels actually gnawed through the plastic. It pretty much was good for one use."
4,A Good Feeder,"A good bird feeder. It is easy to load with seed and attracts a lot of birds. Attaches to a tree or stand via a looped wire. It can be dumped over by a red squirrel, though, as has happened to me a few times. I have bought two of these feeders. They are worth the relatively small expense."
1,"Limp Bizkit is # 1, but this video sure isn't","I love Limp Bizkit, but when I watched this video, I was really disapointed. The whole video was just interviews of people that know Limp Bikzit. There wasn't even any Limp Bizkit songs in it. My advice to you....don't waste your money on it!"
3,"Ok, but only for the true hardcore fans","This video was mediocre, if anything. It was also very disappointing. There is absolutely NO music of theirs on this tape, and NO interviews with the band, which is really pathetic. I was very upset after I watched the whole tape and saw none. Basically this video captures interviews with people that worked with Limp Bizkit before/after/during their fame. There are interviews with the manager of the place Fred was a tattoo artist, there is an interview with the head of the Milk Bar, the place they first played. There's lots of interviews with fans, and also an interview with Fred's ex girlfriend! But she looks so young, it's as if she couldn't even have been his girlfriend!"
1,Poor,"I love LB but this video was horrible, all it had was dumb interviews w/ people i had never even heard about talking about LB. this is a waste of money dont buy it"
1,sorry,"I'm not a big Limp Bizkit fan, but if this was a cool dvd id say it, but its not. Its unauthorized and thats never cool. Peace"
5,The most beautiful Bagpipes music !!!,"The first time I listened to this CD, I could not believe it; Susana Seivane's mastery of the bagpipes sent me to heaven. A must have for the discriminating collector."
4,Accomplished young Piper,"Susana is a very good piper. This is a pleasant album; it's not spine tingling like Hevia, but it's well worth a listen. There's not much new from good pipers these days."
5,Depeche is Depeche....,"Not much to say...they are bether and bether every year, this show is amazing. If you like Depeche Mode this is one of the bests.... Go for it."
2,Audio misses the mark,"The audio on this blu-ray is not that great and was a disappointment. The stereo track sounds a bit hollow and recessed on a good stereo system. If you are buying this for the audio I would pass on it. For comparison, the Madonna Stick and Sweet blu-ray has excellent 5 star audio (and video also)."
5,A Fantastic Look at Depeche Mode in Concert,"The band is awesome! David Gahan, Martin Gore and Andrew Fletcher are at their best and stage presentation is mind blowing. This concert dvd/cd set is a definite must for any devout Depeche Mode fan! Buy it as soon as you read this! I cannot get enough of it. Second dvd in the set lets you look at the inner workings of the band and the trials and tribulations they havegone through to make their career a successful journey for all sincere fans to follow. I am still mesmerized by entire set ofsongs and concert presentation. Depeche Mode is my favorite band and thanks to David and Martin, I have developed a unique voice that one day will be noticed. The entire band is definitely a musical wonder to behold!!Jerod Steele - Singer 2/8/11"
3,This is not a DM class DVD concert.,"If you are expecting the darkness of Devotional, pass on this. If you expect the strong and vital band of Paris, pass on this. I dont know what happen here. Russell Thomas is a top class director, with several concerts in his resume. But this is not one of the best he has done. The camera work seems to match a TV concert. Too many crowd images, too many cameras approaching from the far side of the arena. Picture quality, also not state of art.As regard to the sound, I dont know if it is my home theather, but I sense a poor mix. No trebles, sounds very ""boom"", the guitar is difficult to hear, the voice is low.Well, I hope that maybe I had a first bad watch, and with a second it gets better.German"
5,A Walk In The Park,I love walking in my neighborhood park but lately it's been overun by thugs and low lifes. I'm 68 but my neighbors and I studied Dave's video and we took our park back!Dave is the greatest!
5,Great Video,The product arrived on time and in good condition. It was a gift for my husband and he really liked it. He says it was an excellent portrayal of Martin Luther's struggle for truth.
5,Great Classic,"Written in the early 1950s, the story follows a fellow at the end of his High school years as he finds a way to procure an MG that found the side of a cliff and would have otherwise been unobtainable for him. Set around the adventure to get the car back on the road, the objections of his family and locals over foreign cars and the local scene including racing. The book actually shows a character who has work ethics, a desire to make something of himself and a general love for life. For anyone who enjoys British Sports Cars, has read modern Classics such as 'The Last Open Road' series by Burt Levy, has children interested in reading or automotive fiction or just wants a copy to put back on the shelf after years of missing this classic, I highly recommend 'The Red Car', a book for children of All ages!"
3,"Rebuild a sports car, and win the race...","As a teen, I thought this was a great book. MGs, rebuilds, races, getting the cutest girl in town. I hadn't read this book in decades, and probably should have left the past in the past."
3,is this a classic?,"Frankly I'm stunned. Came across ref in Abe booksleuth and remembered reading a copy in the base library at Scott Field (USAF) in 1962. I had a 49 TC at home in California (had just sold it - to my mother!) Owned it in Canada and driven it south to enlist in the service. This is the first time, then, in almost 50 yearsI've even thought of the book. What is the appeal - reflected in the fact that if you enter it in Abe for instance, you can pay anywhere from 25$ on up to a staggering 290.00$ and that latter for an ex-library copy. One at a mere (!) 56$ was described as 'reading copy only.' Obviously it was time to reprint it!Think I'll try Interlibrary loan and see if I can recapture the magic.james"
5,I wish I had read this when I was younger!,"But still, even now, it's a wonderful book...and not just for kids. I wonder if Bullet is a real town, though?..."
4,OK for the money,"This is OK for the money. I haven't tried the TP lense yet--because I bought this for the WA lense and haven't tried the TP yet. There seems to be a little bit of blur towards the edges. It's not a major problem for what I need, but it's probably not acceptable for high-end use."
1,Useless; I Threw it Out,"This book was a monster waste of money. It gives a brief overview of various types of welding. If you did not know how to weld before you bought this book, you will still be unable to weld after you read it. If you want to learn to weld, but you can't find a class, buy or rent videos."
2,"Maybe better called ""How to Weld Anything... that is a tubular steel car body""","With a name like ""How to Weld Damn Near ANYTHING"", I thought I'd be learning all the tricks needed to weld together two aluminum cans, or maybe the secret to welding a tungsten wear plate to a stainless carrier.Alas, there is none of that. Just a rehash of stuff you can find in any basic welding text without much useful added. If you want basic info, download the Miller introductory books from the web for free and you'll get much more (and better) information."
3,"Good, but could be better","I bought this book hoping to learn more about welding, but i was overall disppointed...But the book is still interesting because they talk about a lot of techniques, like plasma cutting. And there is way too many pictures"
3,Seen this before!!,"I was checking this out at the bookstore today when after a few pages I realized that I have read and seen these same images somewhere before. Then I saw the Author was Finch and realized that its the same book as his ""Welder's Handbook: A Complete Guide to Mig, Tig, Arc & Oxyacetylene Welding"". Whew glad I didn't buy two. Still some usefull info though."
3,not really aimed at the hobbyist,"This book was written to explore advanced aspects of welding, mostly as they pertain to high-strength welding, especially for race car chassis and such. If you are a hobbyist or just loved the Monster Garage TV show, this isn't the book you are expecting it to be."
1,not so great,"Poorly written in a kind of stream of consciousness style, the book is a repackaging of Finch's ""Performance Welding."" Don't buy both.It certainly won't teach you to weld; the information is loosely organized and anecdotal. The book needs a serious editor's touch. It is enjoyable to read for recreation (for the most part), but not a serious text, and therefore more than a bit disappointing."
2,"Good as a General Culture Reference, Not More","It is a very good reference for non serious beginers, It has a lot of pictures but not hands-on explanations. It really doesnt teach you how to weld and it has a contradiction with one of the other books of his series, Here it says TIG Weling is the best for beginners and in the How to fabricate Damn Near Anything, ""the experts"" say it is MIG the best option. Recomended as a weekend reading if you are curious not serious."
2,good movie,good movie but it was not runnig right . it would run and stop run and stop.not a concent run.
1,Meghan could have been great!!!,"You can see she is a snot in her acting, not to mention the rumors about her attitude, I was so hoping she could be wonderwoman, but no, no one will work with her on that one... not to mention no one would go to see it, right?"
3,Better than I expected,"I liked it and the character explaination was surprisingly good. Megan Fox at this time will not be considered one of the premier acting voices and her movie choices will be geared towards her sex appeal but that's OK, she still lights up the screen and will do so for quite some time."
4,OK,"IT was an OK movie, It wasn't whaty I expected but it depends on what your looking for. I was looking for a little more sexual and it wasn't there."
1,Terrible Movie,This movie is a complete waste of time. One of the worst movies ever made. Does not deserve a star.
3,good book,"not what I was looking for, but it was in good condition and we will usr it at our gift auction but they should tell us if there are stamps (DICARDED MAIN DATE) inside in case it was for a gift"
3,quality problems,"I bought this product 1 year ago, then bought a 2nd one two weeks back. To my great surprise, the brand and design were 100% identical, but the manufacturing had clearly changed for the worse... the giveaway was that the screw positions in the back changed, suggesting to me that another factory was manufacturing them. Like an other reviewer noted, the metal band in the metal was too long and buckled slightly... one of the magnetic strips was so cheaply affixed that it actually fell out while I tried to solve the first problem. I would give the first knife holder I purchased 4 stars, and the 2nd one 2 stars. The makes 3 stars on average."
5,Great way to eliminate counter clutter,This magnet is strong and just as advertised. It was super easy to install and holds all of my knives ( I have a lot). It arrived fast. This is really a great product for eliminating that stupid knife block on your counter. It really helped me free up counter space. Great product.
3,magnetic knife holder,"Stainless steel overlay was warped when product arrived, was not fixable & had to be returned. Other than that, it looked great, very heavy duty, strong magnetic hold."
2,A disappointing book,"This book is firmly planted in the romance/fantasy genre and may greatly please those who rarely or never stray from such books. I found it disappointing and even occasionally insipid. (To be fair, the author's vocabulary occasionally shines and delights with its scope.) Lilac is portrayed as an independent woman who prefers to follow her own path; this is admirable. However, halfway through the book these same qualities begin to make her seem like an unreasonable and disagreeable twit with no depth or intuitive perception whatsoever. Interestingly, while the author's name, Dara Joy, sounds distinctly feminine, there are several passages scattered throughout the text that sound as if they are written by a man attempting to assume a female point of view. On the plus side, the cover art is lovely."
5,this one is a keeper!,"Rejar is an absolutely must keep book. The struggle Rejar has with Regency England is funny and provocative. Oh, ladies TURN UP THE AC. It is amazing just what a little imagination can do."
1,I didn't find any redeeming points in this book.,I've read five or six Dara Joy books and I've been determined to give her a chance as so many others enjoy her work but this book genuinely upset me. As on reviewer noted 2 of the sex sceens bordered on rape and that should never be viewed as acceptable. Love making or even sex should not be done b/c the man is angry and wants to take it out on his wife. Never. After that I lost interest.Even the references to Knight of A Trillion Stars sucked. I don't like weak women especially when they are paired with controlling men and thats what Lilac and Rejar were. And then you have the Lorgin and Deanna Reference from Knight where he's just so domineering. What self respecting woman wants a man to rule her?
5,Bad Rap!!!!!,I think this book got a BAD RAP!!!!!!! I REALLY enjoyed this book!!!!!!!!! I loved the relationship between Lilac and Rejar! It was only fitting that he find someone who wasn't falling at his feet. I loved the embroidery scene!!! I think all the women who found the intensity of certain scenes upsetting need to review them again and compare them to other scenes in say (early Johanna Lindsey). There were NO rape scenes in this book!! Rejar was just very intense in the way he made love. He could not hurt her... that would have meant hurting himself. His whole purpose when he made love was to gain the pleasure being reflected back from his partner.
4,"Beats the pants off ""Ritual of Proof""!","Man oh man! I want a cat like Rejar...I like this book. It is well-written, funny as all get-out and STEAMY.This is my second Dara Joy gig. I read ""Ritual of Proof"", and although that one has an interesting hook, ""Rejar"" beats the pants off it all-hollow.READ THIS BOOK!!!!"
3,Handsome guy in an OK book,"Rejar is the second book of the Matrix Trilogy. One drawback is that if you didn't read the first book, Knight of a trillion stars, just because it had a lot of references to that book. When people, scences, or situations were mentioned in Rejar, Ms. Joy didn't really explained it as good as she did in the 1st book.On the other hand, Rejar is a funny and sensual book. It's just that the story didn't really had too much depth in it. The ending was kind of short. It left me hanging for more. I can't believe I can put down this book and return to it the next day."
4,You'll Fall in Love,"Rejar, is the book we spend hours in our local bookstore searching for. It isn't just a fun read. It's magical. He is strong, sexy, seductive; a hunter who has spotted his prey. She is determined, independent, naive; nobody's victim. A love dance, from beginning to end. You will love this book"
4,An avbove excellent story and I can't wait for more.,"Having read Knight of a Trillion Stars in 1996, I have been waiting and searching all of the book stores in NSW Sydney, Australia looking for this book which I finnally found by chance! Although it took me 3 years to find IT WAS WORTH WAITING FOR! I read the story in 24hrs and re-read it in another 24hrs. Dara Joy is as her name describes, a JOY to read as she shows in this second book of hers which was litterally out of this world. Not only is the story facinating to read it leaves you wanting MUCH, MUCH MORE! I will be buying anything of hers that I can find. I am definitley a fan for life."
1,Yuck!,"Although the concept of a sexy familiar traveling through time sounded very appealing, I was so disappointed. I understand that there must be some sort of tension in a love story, but the heroine Lilac was so irritating I couldn't understand why Rejar just didn't say forget it! I felt absolutely no chemistry between the two characters at all. I guess Lilac was supposed to be a spitfire living under the strict mores of Regency England, but she just seemed like an immature brat. In fact, she acted so much like a child I found the sex scenes disturbing. It was like Rejar was trying to seduce a little girl."
5,Non-stop reading,"Bought this book because the cover caught my eye but once I started reading it, I was up half the night because I couldn't stop. I finished it in a day and a half and went to the bookstore to find more books by Dara Joy. The story is sensual, fast paced, the characters are wonderful. I love historical and futuristic novels and this is both wrapped up together. I have already read the sequel and eagerly waiting for the next!"
2,Thumbs down to the heroine in this book,"I really enjoyed the other two Dara Joy books I have read, Knight of a Trillion Stars and Mine to Take. I liked the women in those books. I just wanted to slap the female lead in this story. What on earth does Rejar see in her???? She has no imagination or sense of adventure. She was totally boring."
3,Strange romance,"This is a time travel novel, but not in the traditional sense. Rejar does travel through time, but he is a familar (shape-changing cat) from what I believe is another planet. Kind of confusing because the term familiar, usually refers to a witches cat not a ""species"". He is a likeable character, but his love interest Lilac is not. She is simple, dull, and lacks any sense of adventure. The book was just strange."
2,Disappointing..,"Rejar, with the exception of the last 6 chapters, was a disappointment to me. Compared to the 1st book and the 3rd book, it was by far the weakest when it comes to the story, plot, & the supporting new characters. It lacked emotion and depth which was mainly due to the chemistry with Rejar & his chosen mate Lilac. The setting in 1811 England, just did not work at all with this type of story premise. I am not sure if I will continue reading this series or not."
5,Purrrfectly Enchanting,"Give me more Dara Joy! What a book! I have fallen in LOVE with Lorgin, Rejar, Traed and Gian Ren in the Matrix series of her books. Uhmmmmm. These guys are warriors of my heart. Rejar has love, sincerity, passion and power. Very sensual. My husband now wants me to have a LIFETIME subscription to her books. Everyone must read Knight of a Trillion Stars first. Then Rejar, then Mine to Take in that order. It will all fit together in the last book, but..... we will need Ms. Joy to write the continuing saga about the ""GIFTED"" and his bloodline!"
5,"If you hate sappy romances, check this one out!","I was very new to the romance genre when I came across Dara Joy. Since, then I had the pleasure of meeting the woman behind Rejar. This book is pure, sensual fun! A must read for anyone wanting a little escapism and fun. Sheer joy! Rejar is lucious, unpredictable and a change from the typical hero. His character is full of depth and conviction. It's definitely a book about him and the herione takes a back seat. It has to be that way you create such a powerful and vivid character. I don't know what's more fun reading it over and over or trying to cast the characters in a movie version. Oh how I wish for it to be......."
5,Better than Knight of a Trillion Stars,"I have read this book more times than I care to admit. The hero is sexy, sensuous, and fun. The heroine. is a great foil for him. This book definately puts Dara Joy at the top of my reading list."
1,Not worth the money spent,"I've read all 3 of the Matrix of Destiny books and have to say, of the 3 this is the worst. That is a stretch considering the other 2 aren't particularly good either. Mine to Take was the best of the 3 and I'd only give it 3 stars."
2,Hoping for a rewrite.....,"I've enjoyed Dara Joy's other books very much, and wish I could say the same for REJAR. Cute story, very yummy hero, and a moronic, childish ""heroine"" you just want to slap. A lot. I'm hoping the author will go back and re-work this one at some point, because it could be a great story if the heroine was more appealing..."
3,Not my cup of tea!,"I thought I would give this book a try after reading all the reviews, but half way through the book i have realised that such bizzare story lines don't appeal to me. The only saving grace is that it is a fast read. I didn't even find the [book] as hot as some of the reviewers suggested, that too was a big disappointment"
2,"REJAR, A CAT???? COME ON!!!!!!!!","I admit it I bought this book because of the hunk on the cover, however when I found out he was a cat???? Well, please, that is realistic...I know this is suppose to be a fantasy of sorts but borders on the rediculous. And the heroine, she is not to bright...not much else to say about this book...even the love scenes weren't that great. If I were to describe this book the word, WEIRD..comes to mind...oh, well, to each his own.."
5,Her best yet!,I read tons of romance novels (I have a long train commute and go through a book every two days) and this is the best I've read in a long while. Knight of a Trillion Stars was wonderful and I couldn't wait for Rejar to get his own book. I wasn't disappointed! Dara Joy has a great gift for writing characters (primary and secondary) and giving them depth. Her secondary characters are full-bodied people and the world they inhabit is extraordinary. She can also weave social commentary into her plots - unheard of in the romance genre - in a way that is witty and right on target. Excellent Read!
3,Great potential anyways...,"This is my first Dara Joy novel. While the idea is novel and intriguing (who doesn't think the man-cat transformation is sexy?) the execution was a bit forced. The romance was not convincing, the worlds were not fleshed out well, and the characters were rather dry. The plot was, at best, predictable.Great literature this is not. But despite all the snags, the book had some genuinely funny moments. The supporting characters were amusing if viewed as cartoonish. Sometimes it was so bad, it was good. (Entertaining, at least.) If you enjoy fluffy romances, this one is for you. If you have a short attention span, this one is for you. If you are looking for light entertainment, here you go. But if you were hoping for some attempt at a half-serious historical novel with romance? Try elsewhere."
3,"As a continuation of Knight of a Trillion Stars, it was okay","As a continuation of A knight of a Trillion Stars, this bood was okay. It did not have the THRILL of its predecessor, , but it did answer a lot of questions about the characters. nfortunately, the ending left a lot to be desired, what is with ending it happily ever after, then.. saying that there is more to Rejar's story...??? Now she needs to finish tristan's story and the circle can be complete."
3,"Let's keep the ""futuristic"" in futuristic romance!","Sorry girls, I do not think this was as good as ""Knight of a Trillion Stars"" - Yes, Rejar is sexy, but I am soooo tired of historical romances I could scream! Think about it seriously, could YOU survive without your comforts if you got thrown back in time."
2,Didn't like the Heroine,"This was my first Dara Joy book. I have to admit the love scenes aren't too bad, and it had one hilarious part where the heroine accidentally blurts some bedroom secrets between herself and Rejar.Overall, the entire book was really boring. The heroine grated on my nerves. Rejar was such an interesting character I wish more could have been done to match him up with a better mate.There were indeed a lot of ""Knight of the Trillion Stars"" references which I later skimmed in a bookstore to understand some things from this book. I thought Rejar's mate was annoying, his half-brother's mate was ten times more irritating.Despite all that, I decided to give Dara Joy another chance and went to buy ""Mine to Take"". Dara Joy's ideal heroine appears to not to be on my personal liking list. It's a shame because all her Hero's appear to be interesting characters.I don't believe I would ever buy another Dara Joy book again. And I would never recommend her to anyone."
2,"This is an old, old, video with low production standards","Hopper was a man of few words. It is almost comical to watch the interviewer trying to get him to say something. Except for that it is dull dull dull, reminding us how bad TV was in its infancy."
2,Returned the Kindle edition,"I looked ""inside this book,"" which gave me a view of the Table of Contents. I liked what I saw, because there was a decent chapter on transcortical motor aphasias, on which I wanted an update. So I ordered and downloaded the Kindle edition, which would be the 2011 edition. There was no chapter on TMA. In fact, all the chapters on specific syndromes were gone. Instead, there appeared to be much more focus on rehabilitation. And chapter 2 is now on ""Humanistic"" aspects of language disorders, whatever that may mean.So, if you're sizing this up for a Kindle purchase, be forewarned: the TOC you get in the preview of the 2004 edition is radically different from the one you will receive. I have ordered a used copy of the 2004 edition."
1,False product,I've purchased this for several years and it has always been great. But not this time. The product inside the container was not the correct product. This is suppose to be a paste product and what was found was more of a gel product. The company I purchsed the product from evidently mispackage the goods. Also the containers were found to be half empty.
5,A Pleasure to Play,The music in this book is delightful to play. Technically it is not difficult yet the harmony is full bodied. The songs range from introspective to light jazz. Most of the songs match the tracks in the album by the same name.
3,Thundercats Season 1 Book 3,As with the first two books it carries on with the journey to gain back what is lost.It has some slow patches at stages through the episodes but does leave you wanting to find out what happens next. If you like the origional series this may be a step up in the style it is presented in. Look out for some twists you never saw coming but I won't tell. You will have to find out for yourself. The next book will most likely be the start of season 2 but this is only an asumption & will in my opion be worth getting if it runs in the same style as the first.I would like to give it 3 & a half stars but don't get that option & is only because it would be better if season 1 came as a set not as 3 sets of one season..Thundercats Season 1 Book 3
5,Seson 2 Please.....,"I just finished watching this with my kids and I have to say I was blown away. I've watched many a season of cartoons with my children from Ben-10 to Scooby Doo and this was by far the most satisfying. There is a real plot and the writers have taken time to get the audience invested in the characters. In addition, the animators seem to have taken a lot more chances as the season progressed and the final run of episodes have some really imaginative and clever artwork and framing. In particular, the close up framing of the characters faces from the amazing shots of Mum-Ra to the horrified and shocked faces of Lion-O et al are brilliant and very unusual for a prime-time cartoon. My kids were totally gripped and couldn't believe it when I said that there were no more episodes.Season 2 please...pronto."
5,A new spin on a classic cartoon,"This is an impressive update to the original series from the 1980's. Being a big fan of the ThunderCats, I could hardly wait for the DVDs to come out after the new series was launched.It doesn't disappoint. The story line is far different than the original series, and it's ""darker"" than the original. But it still focuses on the core aspects of the ThunderCat philosophies of truth, honor, and loyalty. They spend time tackling all kinds of issues from racism, to slavery, to the value of friendship, and plenty more.May not be suitable for really young kids. I loaned my set to a colleague, and he said his 6 year old didn't like some of the more violent sequences...particularly where someone was killed (which never happened in the original series)."
3,"Sorry, not impressed","This was my first Earl Emerson read. The characters were likeable enough, but it just didn't get it for me. If you want some REALLY good P.I. books, try Dennis Lehane, he rocks!"
3,Irresistable!,"Stephen Greenleaf and Earl Emerson are probably the two finest practitioners of the ""hardboiled P.I."" school currently writing. THE MILLION-DOLLAR TATTOO admirably displays Emerson's strengths: a smooth, colorful style; a complex, outrageous, but ultimately credible plot; a motley cast of well-drawn characters; an outstanding sense of pace; a terrific ear for dialogue; and well-timed humor.Other reviews here will give you a hint about the plot, so I'll simply add that underlying all of it is the serious theme of the misuse of money and power."
1,Critical Review,The instructions for this watch are so confusing and unclear that I have not yet been able to even set the time on the watch.
5,"So Far, The Album Of The Year","Hell Razah always seemed like a star in the making back with the Sunz Of Man, but 'Renaissance Child' is even better than fans could have hoped. Razah is an absolute flamethrower on this record, touching on everything from religion to Dick Cheney. While he doesn't shy from talking about life on the streets here and there, don't pick this up if you're expecting a typical hardcore hip-hop album. This is a record that you'll need time to wrap your head around .Thankfully, the production team is ready to keep up. The beats on this record are top-shelf, mixing that classic 'haunting piano' Wu-Tang sound with some old-school horn section stuff. Add in killer verses from some of the underground's top MCs (particularly Ras Kass and the Rugged Man, who completely tears it up), and you've got the best album yet of 2007."
4,classic,"this album was off the hook....razah has a deep style, and his production is great. every beat knocked PRETTY HARD. alot of classic cuts on this one. pretty decent collabos as well. the renaissaince track with timbo king, tragedy khadafi and ra the rugged man is probably the best track on here. there were a few tracks that had very un interesting mediocre beats and there were more than a couple of tracks that had horrible hooks, hence the 4 stars. BUT FOR THE BEATS ALONE I WOULD BUY THIS ALBUM."
4,Good music,"I like his flow and can hear the Rakim influence in his flow. He sounds like him a little. Again another solid album that Bronze was involved in. This cat came back with a vangance. I gave it 4 stars because 2-3 songs are tired for me, but the lyrics make up for it. H-Raizah is gansta."
2,Heir to Groove Armada's Vertigo?,"That is a very bold statement by the Amazon editor. This Back to Mine album and Groove Armada's legendary Vertigo are not even in the same class.I'm a big fan of Groove Armada, and even though this is a compilation mixed from other artists' tracks, I am disappointed that their name is on the cover.Back to Mine is a good series. They get great DJ's to actually MIX their own selection of tracks. Mixing adds a unique flavour to an industry (i.e. chillout/ambient albums) that is overly saturated with subpar releases.Regardless, this is not one of the better Back to Mine albums. The track selection is horrible and stale. We all love Barry White and Al Green, but their particular tracks do not gel well with the others on this album. One may argue that the ablum is eclectic. This is true, but eclectic tracks don't work well if they lack even a little chemistry (other than just a slow tempo). I expected much more from this pair of very talented Brits.2/5 stars."
2,Groove Armada Spins,"The duet of Groove Armada -- with their mix of subtle horns, deep bass grooves, and fusion of unique lyrics -- is behind this elcetic compilation of tracks. It should be noted that this is *not* their original music. Fans looking for an introduction to G.A. will be much better off purchasing the groups ""Vertigo"" album. This is part of the 'Back to Mine' series where the group is asked to select, and mix songs that have influenced them in the past. A few tracks such ""Description of a Fool"" and ""Stanway's Revenge"" are great inclusions and you can see why G.A. picked them to appear on this album, however many of the other songs were disappointing at least in this reviewer's opinion. Moving in Stereo - d.i.roberts"
2,They've done so much better,"For people expecting the chill, downtempo, easy foot-tappin' harmony of ""Vertigo"", ""Back to Mine"" doesn't quite measure up. As another reviewer here put it, the 80s synth-pop is a step is a very different direction. That said, ""Back To Mine"" does have some good tracks. For those listeners new to Groove Armada, I would recommend going straight to ""Vertigo""."
3,50/50 I agree,"I agree with what another reviewer said about this CD being 50/50. I loved half the songs, but the other half got on my nerve endings. Overall, it wasn't worth keeping, so I turned around and sold the CD after listening to it once or twice. I was dissapointed and would not recommend anyone buying it."
3,"50/50 Half you'll Love, the other half . . .","First off, let me state that I neither love this CD nor hate it, though I do have a strong opinion on it as I think that Groove Armada is worthy of doing so much more than putting together a mediocore mix CD. Unfortunatley this would have been so much better had they kept with the original concept and followed the recipe that they threw together in the first few songs, by that I mean a nice mellow vibe (i.e. tracks 1-4 or 5). At times however it seems that they throw in some really bad mixes of 80's synth-pop that just does not fit with the molding in my couch as I am trying to relax to a ""downtempo"" disc. That being my one and only real complaint, I can easily say that you will probably enjoy this CD at first as it has a decent vibe but will eventually grow tiresome of it as time passes on."
3,I was surprised at how good this little book is.,"Not Shakespeare, but not drivel either. Craftsman like standard fare. The characters were well developed, the plot interesting, the magic believable. The bad guys were a tad too bad, one dimensional, but...well, these are bad guys and since all I know of the Forgotten Realms I learned from Baldur's Gate, which I played until the disc disintegrated years ago, I was happy with the book as a whole. My only serious complaint is that the words ""Riven sneered"" is on nearly every page, once his character is introduced. I almost started a drinking game, then realized I would be unconscious by about page 15, and so restrained myself admirably. I plan on buying the other two books. This is decent escapist fare."
2,AMW,"Before you buy this one-I must tell you that it is full of potential but ultimately kills you with cheesyness, if that's even a word. Regardless, before you attempt to buy this stop whatever you are doing and run,run,RUUUUUUUUUUUNNN! However; if you did not run and are still reading--I recommend R.A. Salvatores Silent Blade or Troy Dennings Forgotten Realms Ogres Pact"
3,Well written,"It starts out a little slow and the moral issues Cale deals with start to drag after a while, but overall well written and the action is very visual."
2,beautiful photos but not much help,"I am a beginning beader and I was struck by the beautiful necklace design on the front of this book. But when I got it home I found the instructions were not precise step by step, rather, they show only the materials list and the finished project. And the projects rely on the use of an additional piece of equipment, the WigJig, which I don't own. I returned this book as I didn't feel it would add anything to my bead reference library. For non-bead focused wire jewelry projects with excellent step by step instructions, see Great Wire Jewelry by Peterson or Making Wire Jewelry by Clegg and Larom."
2,Not what I'd hoped for,"Not having done wire work before, I was eager to learn basic wire jewelry techniques. While this book is beautifully illustrated with project ideas, it lacks the specifics a beginner needs to know.Also, most of the projects included require a wire jig, but nowhere in the book is there instruction on how to wrap the wire on a jig. There are jig patterns in the back of the book, but no instruction on how to carry them out. Frankly, I was disappointed. I'd probably like this book a lot if I'd had prior wire working experience, but it was little help to a beginner."
2,I agree-not for beginners!,"Luckily, I've been working with wire for some time. I bought this book to get some ideas and refresh my own work, which is what this book should be sold as. If I were still a beginner, I would be very intimidated by this book and probably not continue with wire working. It is a beautiful book, but does not give any detailed directions (I'm even confused by some of the projects!) However, I do like the jig patterns in the back of the book. If you're an intermediate, go for it! If not, there are some great websites to get you started (try about.com)."
3,Disappointing,"I found the wire design projects in this book to be redundant when compared with the projects available online and in some other books. They are not just similar - they are exactly the same. For one project that I like enough to attempt, the instructions are unclear and seem to be incomplete. After reading through them several times, the only thing that was clear was that I'd either have to figure it out for myself or forget about it. I'm at the lower intermediate level, so this book is definitely not suitable for beginners. There isn't much to get excited about and I'm rather disappointed in this book."
3,"Good photos and ideas, low on instruction, poor editing","Lots of nice photos, but you need to figure it out yourself on how to do them. Very poorly edited - some instructions just stop in the middle of a sentence. The last design tells you to go to a certain page to get the pattern for it - and it is not on that page or on any page in the book at all. It is simply missing.So it was a frustrating read.However, there are some great designs. So I'd say it is a good book if you are already somewhat familiar with wire and hammering and design - good ideas for you -but not a great book for beginner jewelry makers."
3,Not a Bad buy,Wonderful projects ..but not enough pictures to guide and to help you understand what you are doing... Not a book for beginnners.
4,ambitious comeback,"This was in interesting and very ambitious ""comeback"" album for Rick James back in 1997. Clearly, he's not trying to repeat the same all thing all over again, but experimenting with a few new sounds while still giving fans what they expect. Over an hour's worth of music, highlighted by his usual funky jams, some ballads, along with a few hip-hop flavored tracks. It doesn't all work for me, I found myself skipping a few of these tracks after a few listens, but most of the tunes are keepers. Rick James fans from back in the day should enjoy this CD very much."
4,Brandon Davids ZA Rick James Urban Rhapsody Review,"A really good disc by the Super Freak.A lot of typical funk.And the classic ""Never say you love me"" featuring JO-JO MC Duffie from the Mary Jane girls on lead vocals with Rick.What an excellent duet in line with Happy and Fire and desire, that Rick dis with Teena Marie.This disc is a must have for classic fans of the Super Freak.Bu now you may regret later."
3,looks more like holly leaves,"I ordered this to make chocolates for my Navy Nurse Corps spouse to give as Christmas presents. The general consensus is that these leaves look more like holly leaves, not oak leaves. I can still get some use out of them, but wish I would have ordered the other oak leaf mold instead."
5,A great addition for my Macintosh,"The Lacie external hard drive works great with my Macintosh iBook right out of the box, with no installation or set-up necessary.It comes with all the needed power and FireWire cables, so I just had to plug it in, and my computer immediately had another 200 gigabytes of space.It runs quietly, its metal case does not get too warm, and saving files is as fast as on a built-in hard drive.(Note: My drive died about 9 months after I got it, but LaCie sent a replacement quickly, and the new one has been working for over a month with no problems. Aside from the one mechanical failure, I have had no problems using the drive on a Macintosh.)(Note: The second replacement drive died in 2008, so that's two dead LaCie drives in four years. I don't think I'll get another one of these.)"
5,excellent addition to laptop,I bought this hard drive simply because the hard driveincluded with my fujitsu laptop just couldn't keep up.laptop drives are slow in comparison to firewire drives.nice design and matches well with fujitsu celsius laptop.
4,Good Mopping Sponge,This one is better than others available in market. Did not break after few use.
1,Bad Experience,"I WENT TO PUSH DOWN TO SQUEEZE WATER OUT, IT SNAPPED BACK, I RECEIVED A BLOOD BLISTER ON MY RIGHT HAND INDEX FINGER, I AM HOME TREATING IT AS BEST I CAN, I HOPE I DO NOT LOSE MY FINGER..............."
1,HELP!,"I need a refill for my mop and cannot find the right size anywhere. Mop refills online do not list details (size, if they are attached w/screws, etc.). Can someone please tell me the length of the Quickie 0272 Jumbo mop refill and if it is attached with 4 screws.Thank you."
3,Only works with professional mop,Note that this doesn't work with the usual mops that one purchased at the store (which needs an H type - look on the mop itself and it will tell you. Needs a special mop. Amazon also doesn't let you return these if you accidentally bought it like I did.
4,original equipment,After going to 2 stores and found out they were out of stock decided to order on line and got it at a cheaper price. Not sure what the little red pad is for but sponge is good quality.
2,Only just acceptable,"My old sponge mop had four fasteners. The new refill has only one fastener at each end and two :""nubs"" for the center holes in the mop assembly. To squeeze out the sponge mop you have to hold the middle of the sponge in while sliding the mechanism down the handle. Very cumbersome. I probably will not buy this replacement sponge refill again."
5,"""Lord, help us to grow up""","Watchman Nee received revelation and understanding from God. If you want to know more about the growing up process in your christian life, read this book. Its a timeless gem."
1,Duped by Mao,This book was long thought as being an important book on the history of the Chinese revolution. The history it presents is systematically torn apart by the definitive biography Mao The Untold Story. Red Star Over China is poppycock next to the comprehensively researched and devastating picture provided by Mao The Untold Story.
2,Real Reviews?,"Beware of political operatives from the PRC posing as reviewers. Many 5 star reviews are written by people who have never reviewed any other book before or since. Highly suspicious, but understandable given the regime's investment in the myth of the Great Leader."
3,Not the best version,"No map, no photo, no illustration. That's somehow disappointing. I guess the hard cover by Hesperides Press might be a better choice."
2,"Gee whiz, it's South America","In light of the BBC's previous cutting edge documentaries about lifestyles and animals, ""Wild South America"" is a huge disappointment. The gorgeous landscapes and remarkable close-ups of animals lose their power thanks to Nicholas Hooper's repetitive attempt at indigenous music and the frequent redundancies in content. But the most distressing element of this six-part series is the narration written by Pelham Aldrich-Blake and spoken with inappropriate romanticism by Fergal Keane. Frequently anthropomorphic and generally banal, it carries a ""gee whiz"" attitude as if the filmmakers were surprised by what they found with their own research. The producers clearly had time and money to spend on this major series, and their efforts and devotion show in its stunning visuals. Too bad it has nothing to say that couldn't be found in a grammar school primer."
5,Amazing Resource,"I bought this book years ago while studying counterpoint in college and became utterly fascinated with it. A few years ago I realized I didn't have it anymore; I'd loaned it out and it went un-returned. Luckily, I found it still in print and available here on Amazon. As Moz scored his first quartet at age 14 and his last at 34, this book-- with it's chronological presentation-- offers fascinating insight into his growth as a composer. I frequently pull various passages from the scores and share them with my students. Additionally, this book is constructed properly... both volumes I've owned have worn quite well. Good stuff!"
1,BLEH!,"Mozart is supposed to be one of the greatest and most prolific composers...well...he starts to wear a little thin here! His operas and orchestrals are wonderful, but if you want the most prosaic pieces of music of all time, try these quartets. (I never regreted switching to viola so much until Mozart and the cello part isn't any better)."
2,The picture wasn't what I received,"I received green recycled wood plates and, and yellow cups, I kept them just because the girls enjoyed playing with them anyway. Wasn't what was expected!"
1,disappointed in this,"Although very cute, this set is too small to be of use except to very small toddlers. For our preschool children it was not appropriate. I sent it back to Amazon immediately."
4,wood is better than plastic for any child,"nice set, spoon and fork are flat and totally safe but you cannot spoon or fork things - good/badno plastic in the packaging - all paper padding and cardboard.if you are like me and want to keep the plastic down (nearly impossible in today's modern world)consider this - cost a little more but - if you want cheep just use paper plates and plastic ware.highly considering more of their products"
4,Smaller than expected,"The dishes were smaller than expected-- smaller than the plastic Lakeshore alternative. That said, they were so utterly adorable that my sister threatened to steal them for her daughter's kitchen set."
2,Not my favorite,"The rest of you may like this, but I just personally don't. It just has a boring plot, finding the Popular Girl magazine and just taking that popularity test. So if I were you I wonldn't read this boring book."
1,Returning!,There were pages missing from this book! It will have to be returned! You can't very well study for a class with pages missing!
3,Rilla of Ingleside,"For some reason I read this one before any of the other sequels, but it was well worth it. I love that time period, WWI, and I truly loved Rilla. However, the part about little Bruce Meredith's ""sacrifice"" was totally unneeded, and it just completely upset me to the point that I can never read this book again. If Montgomery hadn't put that in, I would have given this book five stars."

3,Anne should never be old!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I LOVE the anne books, and loved the story in this one too. My only problem is that Anne and Gilbert are old! They always are referred to now as Mrs. Blythe and Dr. Blythe. It is a sweet story but it needed more Anne! If you've read the other seven, you have to read the book, but in my opinion L.M. Montgomery should have stopped at the fifth."
5,This Book is The Best,"This is a really touching, beautiful novel. I even cried when Walter died because Montgomery makes you feel like you have become friends with the characters. This is one of those books that I will probably never forget. -K.W.G"
3,"Too much war, not enough Anne","I adore the early Anne of Green Gables books and was hoping that this, as the last in the series, would bring it all to closure. I was disappointed at the lack of ""Anne"" in the book, though I loved Rilla. I also got lost in all the discussion of war. That was the main theme of the book."
1,Horrible,"Don't get me wrong; I LOVE Anne but this book was depressing. Hate it!! I hated the way Rilla treated the baby half the time. It was harsh to hear of starving children and people dying and people being mean to cats, etc etc. Also I found it VERY disturbing the way Rilla doesn't give a fig about her Aunt Marilla, whom she was named after. I guess Marilla died when she was young but her sentiments towards her are very flippant. Marilla played a HUGE role in her mother's life. I don't like this book, the only Anne book I truly like is Anne of Green Gables, and I think that the Anne movies are better than the books except for the Continuing Story, which I heard is so horrible I refuse to even watch it."
4,End of the series...,"This book was good, although more darker than previous installments because World War 1 begins and ends in this book, taking up much of the story. 'House of Dreams' was touched with tragedy, but here it is more central amidst the happenings of the First World War and focuses mainly on Rilla, the youngest child of Anne.I wish this story had centered more on Anne or that there was a ninth installment in this series, because in the last two books, Anne was also downplayed, so the series should have ended on a old but still vibrant Anne."
5,Wonderful book; I couldn't put it down!,"I had read the first seven books of the Anne of Green Gables series. The fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh books were gradually getting more and more boring, but I decided to read on. Rilla of Ingleside is by far the best of the series. I rarely feel emotion over books, but this one positively sent chills up my spine-especially the chapter entitled ""And So, Goodnight"". This book was happy, sad, joyful, and tragic all at once. In this book, the author describes Kenneth Ford's love letters to Rilla as ""never growing flat or insipid with ever so many scores of readings"". That's how I'd describe this book. This is a must-read, especially for girls about to undergo the change from child to woman. Happy reading! =)"
4,I recommend it (if you like strong emotional books and don't mind occasional verbosity).,"This book was very emotional and in some places, heartbreaking. I have read the whole Anne series, but this is my second - favourite. I loved the ending, it was so romantic and yet somewhat hilarious. Rilla of Ingleside made me understand the true tragedy and scope of war, and how it tears apart so many families and hearts."
4,Caller ID and Custom Name Display,"When you receive a call from someone whos' number is in your phonebook, the caller ID displays the caller's name as it is sent by the phone service carrier, not as it is stored in your phonebook. For example: the display will read ""Verizon Wireless"" instead of the name of the caller as it is stored in your phonebook. The talking caller ID works the same way. There are other Panasonic phones that offer a ""Custom Name Display"", and will display and speak the name as it is stored. Why didn't Panasonic put this feature into this phone? This would be the perfect phone if this feature were included."
4,nice,i love the caller id announcer. that is great. it did take me awhile to figure out it had a handset locator. all around good phone but i think i was happier with my past v-tech and uniden.
5,Panasonic KX-TG5776S,I have this Panasonic KX-TG5776S foe 2.5 month.COOL TOY for people who like good stuff in the house.easy to use just take a time for self.file wav only for this phone that can do it.Cut past song 30 sec any song you like do it.convert mp3 to wav then use Panasonic software.Easy to use cid call id very thing is color.Phonebook name who you like then u use color rings show up caller and song.If you do not want pick up phone will talk CID.Your telephone company send signal to your cid.My company is verizon is very good and i have DSL do not for get filter big sound at telephone if do not do it.Wallpaper come with this phone choose any picture u like to will do it like desktop computer at front of your telephone.I bought cheap from amazon with my credit card $30 off plus that why like amazon In the store will cost me more.
1,Worst phone from Panasonic,"Lack of clarity sound with unacceptable distorted noise. No backlit on Answer or End call key which is also unacceptable. I have VTech I5871 and because the handset is too long... much further than where my mouth is, therefore, my friend barely can hear me well. So I look for another phone and found this. When first hooked up this phone - first dissapointment.... no backlit on Answer or End call key. Now at the dial tone, I can hear annoying noise behind dial tone. So I unplug the phone cord from the phone, and see if it is still there. Unfortunately, the noise is still there. I immediately switch back to VTech i5871, without phone cord plug in... all I hear is dead silence... I plugged the phone cord back in, I can hear dial tone clearly without ANY distorted noise - now that's what I call clarity. I had Panasonic phone before and they were pretty good. But this one is just a big disappointment."
4,Panasonic KXTG5776S,The phone is a good buy for the price. I often use it in my shop about 125' from the house and it works very well. The sound quality is fair. But all in all it is about as good as you can get for the price.
4,"has all features desired, sound OK, not great","Bought this set (and 3 more handsets) to use as intercom and phone. Searched to find one with backlit keys, answering machine, and other features. Works fine, and features (intercom) have a lot of flexibility. It is possible to store, edit, and upload address book to phones with included software (PC only). Sound quality seems a bit buzzy compared to an older cordless phone we had used previously, but perhaps that varies depending on luck with quality of particular base unit. (All 4 handsets were similar in sound quality). Handsets are small and convenient, no particular problems using keys. Speaker phone feature works OK and has turned out to be convenient. Easy to switch from speaker to earpiece at press of button."
4,Fun phone,"My family really enjoys this phone. I never thought I would use the words enjoy and phone together in the same sentence unless talking about 1-900 numbers :-).Anyway, the speaker phone feature is excellent and the phone is comfortable when this feature is not being used.The best feature is the ability to associate audio clips with phone numbers. I associated ""Darth Vader's Death March"" to my mother in-laws phone number; for the first time ever I now smile every time she calls.The phone does attempt to say the name of the caller (if you have caller ID). It does an ok job at this.We do not use the multiple handset/base station feature of the phone.I would highly recommend this product for its speaker phone alone... add to that the ability to associate music clips with phone numbers and you have a phone that the entire family will enjoy using."
4,"Useful, but not the only tool you will need.","This book is wonderful for its' many lists of subjects to study, though you should be forwarned that the list is VERY extensive, and for me it was somewhat intimidating. I timed myself using the tests only after much studying so that I could see exactly how well I was doing and what I needed to brush up on the week before the test. (Just wish there were more practice tests!) There is also some really good general advice regarding taking the test.That said, you will need to review your music history, theory, and music ed. materials before taking the test. I found that Music Appreciation books were great for music history review.I guess my best bit of information regarding the success for this book is that even though standardized tests and I generally do not get along, I PASSED ON THE FIRST TRY with plenty of points to spare. Best of luck!!"
3,"Misleading description, but helpful overall","I purchased this item to help me prepare for the music:content knowledge PRAXIS II. When I purchased the book, the description led me to believe that there would be study hints or a review of material, but it was just a glorified list of topics. The authors just listed the kinds of things you should review, but it was pretty much a ""just study everything"" kind of help. There was no actual review of relevant materials, and I didn't feel that I got my money's worth.The practice tests were helpful, if completely different from anything I saw on the actual test. I've purchased other study guides by companies other than ETS, and they were much more helpful and full of material reviews - exactly what I'm looking for in a study guide! Do not purchase this item if you want help reviewing. If you're just looking for a list of topics to study, then this item is for you (though you could probably just as easily figure out what YOU need refreshing on)."
3,It's a Help,"This book is helpful in studying for the Praxis. It has a detailed outline of what information you should know.... and then sends you off to your old textbooks to gather the information. It would be nice if this book contained more actual information. (For example: instead of saying ""Know german, italian, and french augmented sixth chords."" It would actually tell you what a german, italian, and french augemented sixth chord is) However, I guess that might this book huge. It does a good job telling you what to expect on the praxis. SO, all in all it is helpful and I feel a lot better off with it than without it."
2,Not that great,"I bought this product hoping that the practice tests would help me. Well, it only had 1 practice test for the music content knowledge. Also, the practice test was much easier than the real test. I don't think that this book prepared me very well. It did help me gain a little understanding of how the test would look and would be laid out. The test is set up with questions that the candidate will not be able to answer. I knew this going into the test and I thought that this book would help with that. It doesn't help as much as I think is necessary."
3,Useful but could be better,"The Praxis Study guide for Music Content was a helpful source. I am taking the Praxis test tomorrow morning so we'll see if I actually pass or not. The practice test was shorter than the actual test and I have heard the questions on the practice test are much easier than on the actual exam. The book listed all of the topics that could be on the test, but the sheer amount was overwhelming and very little can be done to ""cram"" with this book. It does help some, and gives you a better understanding of what the test could be like."
4,I wish Amazon organized their information better...,"The book came when it was supposed to but I needed it sooner. When checking out I didn't see the option to expedite and after ordering it, I didn't know how long it would take. NOT the sellers fault. Amazon doesn't really organize the information well."
3,the desperation of life in the war zone,"Rosso, an honest cop in wartorn Sarajevo, tries to solve the murder of a police informant. Meanwhile, the Serbs are attacking the city, his detectives are mostly corrupt or stoned, his wife is drinking anything she can get her hands on & his sort-of-adopted daughter is cavorting with a Croat strongman.Fullerton was a foreign correspondent & covered the war in Bosnia. He vividly portrays the desperation of life in the war zone and the near lawlessness of Sarajevo adds additional tension to a fairly straightforward mystery. GRADE: B-"
5,The Monkey House review,Fast paced and exciting this book will keep you on edge the whole way through.I couldn't get to sleep without finishing it.This writer has a lot of talent.
3,"A good war report, but the thriller?","This book is written with great style and capability. Youwill live three days of life of Sarajevo, as if you werethere. Unfortunately, the ""thriller"" part of it is notintriguating, even if the author had some good ideas. Toomuch real life (remember that Fullerton is a war-journalist)and not enough excitement."
3,Great on dashboard. Too slippery for seats.,"Bought this to take care of my new leather interior of my BMW and my old Honda.Pros:1. Cleans and conditions. You don't need to buy two separate products for each.2. Leaves leather with a rich luster without being too shiny and refective like Armorall.3. NO greasy residue or greasy finish. It dries clear.Cons:If you use it on cheaper leather seats, it makes the seats very slippery.I used this on a 2008 Honda and it's almost comical how I slip and slide around the seat after using this product.On softer leathers like in a BMW, it just cleans and conditions without being slippery.Bottom Line:Great for leather interiors but would not use this again on leather seats in cheaper cars."
5,great,Have been using this product on my cars for ages and now also use iton my leather sofa. Really works great.
4,A Better Conditioner than Cleaner,"I bought this product for our 2013 Ford Taurus Limited. It has done 5000 miles and already the perforated beige leather on the driver's seat is showing some noticeable wear and dirt transfer. Well, it's Ford leather, not Bentley leather, so what was I supposed to expect?This product has done a good job of cleaning the leather, but an even better job of conditioning it. I generally use about once every two weeks. I spray a quantity on a clean microfiber cloth and work the liquid into the seats, leave for a few minutes, then buff off with another microfiber cloth. The finish is very good/excellent.Overall, 4 out of 5 stars, because it probably isn't the best product out there for cleaning."
4,Good value!,"After a long search, I finally found a tricycle with:a steel frame for durability,a lower seat for stability (and to accommodate my petite 2-year-olds),a removable push-bar (so we can enjoy it more as the kiddos learn to pedal), andfree-wheel capability (so the kiddos don't get feet tangled up when Mom/Dad is pushing).Of the 50-odd different tricycles I looked at, this was the only one with this combination of features for under $100. In addition to these key features, it's got fun handlebar tassels, a classic color scheme, a little travel pack, and a comfortable folding parent handgrip. Kettler has excellent resale value, so that's also a perk for when we outgrow these tricycles.My rating lost a star because the plastic pieces (handlebar-to-fork cover, rear ""hubcaps"") have come loose and needed to be re-adjusted on one of our trikes (we have two of these, as I have twins)."
3,It's OK,"Not a bad bike, but there are a few things I wish were different. The front wheel looks very wobbly when the bike rolls, eventhough the bike moves forward straight. Also the screws that came with the bike attach the plastic footstand to the back of the bike will not screw in all the way. The handle for the parent to push the bike does not fit tight into the bike, so it is constantly turning while you are pushing. On the plus side it is a cool looking bike, and our 2 year old son does loves it. It is a very good size for him right now, and with 2 more positions to adjust the seat to, this bike should last him a while."
3,"Great tricycle, not so great handle!","My 2-year-old LOVES the tricycle and it is a great fit for him. The only complaint I have is with the handle. It does not stay on the bike if you pull too hard. It is almost as if it won't ""snap"" into place. Hopefully, he will learn to ride it on his own soon and the handle won't be needed anyways."
3,Ultraglide feature is great,"The ultraglide feature of this iron is great, but from the very first time I used the iron, when it is on the steam portion of the iron, it spits out water when I sit the iron up. It doesn't spit when ironing, just when you sit it up. I am only using the iron on dry now and using a water bottle. I purchased this iron because it DID NOT have a auto-off feature and that is what my main focus was. I will continue to search out an iron without the auto-off feature."
5,I love this iron,"This is the third iron purchase for me in the last few months and thank goodness it will be the last one. Very, very pleased with the quailty of this iron, it steams well and glides like a dream. Looking for a good iron ? Buy the T-Fal."
3,Fast and Easy Ironing,"This iron is good in so far as it does not burn my clothes. BUT, what I don't like about it is that when the steam comes out, also does bits of water.This is not what is is suppose to do."
3,ergonomically incorrect for me,"This is a nice looking iron with great features, but as soon as i picked it up, it didn't feel right. I didn't want to take the chance of using it and then not being able to return it.I have small hands and a mild case of carpel tunnel. The weight of the iron was not balanced correctly for my hands. By comparison, I pulled out my old GE iron and found it much more comfortable to hold.Holding a tool that fits makes all the difference."
2,Sadly Disappointed!,"This was the best iron ever in the beginning. Light in weight. Smooth non-stick plate. Then it started spitting on everything. Leaked water. Now the dial just keeps spinning. No adjustments. Can only iron on super hot. Well, that's great for cotton or linen, but any synthetic fabric burns. This iron only lasted about a year. I can say that I did love it at first, but sad to see it die in such a short time. Will definitely NOT buy this model again!"
2,aweful,"I thouroughly read reviews before purchasing. was looking to replace a broken steam iron. this does not make for a good replacement. Takes a long time to iron with and a long time to ""master"" ."
1,the spitting iron!,"Why is it so difficult for manufacturers to make an iron that works? This one started spitting water droplets from the moment I turned it on, and it never quit. I have had T-fals in the past that worked, but not this one. I suspect they have changed their construction as I had bought one from Target months ago (a different model) and it did the same thing. The best thing about this was Amazon's return policy.....piece of cake, no shipping charge, and the amount was credited back to me immediately. T-fal could take a lesson!"
4,Worth the price,"On my wish list for a new iron was the vertical steam feature and no automatic shut-off. I wanted to be able to steam the wrinkles out of things like curtains while they're hanging because the ones I have are too big to wrestle with on the ironing board. I also wanted to be able to come back to the iron while I sew and not find it had turned off. The vertical steam on this iron doesn't work quite as well as I had hoped but everything else about it is very nice. It gets good and hot for things like linen yet has a nonstick soleplate. It fills easier than my old iron and I can clearly see the water level. The dial is a bit awkward and I'm never quite sure which way is off, but as I always unplug the iron and put it away, that's not much of an issue. For a fairly low-priced iron, I think it's well worth the price."
1,Worst iron ever...,"I bought this iron based on all good reviews on Amazon and what a total disappointment this iron was. First of all, it gets overheated and then starts frying your clothes. Then, it got burn stains that were impossible to remove. I've used this iron for less than a year and it's now a piece of junk ready to be thrown away. Would not recommend."
5,"Wonderful, Relaxing",Pretty but too short2008-11-25 - Why are there only 4 songs on this CD? I didn't pay attention to this when I bought it last week and feel like I didn't get a very good deal. The music is lovely but just not enough.
1,Disappointed,"Maybe I missed it somewhere on the webpage but, this CD only had 4 songs on it. It cost as much as ""The Very Best of Enya"" CD which has the typical amount of songs on it. The songs are nice but, by the time you put the CD in, and start doing something else, it's over already."
4,Enya's Christmas Secrets,Enya's sound is unsurpassed. Only drawback is that it has only has 4 songs but they are great. More songs would have given her 5 stars.
3,Christmas Secrets,I own many of Enya's musical works and I have never been disappointed. I do wish this particular CD had been a little longer.
2,BEWARE only 4 songs,"The songs are quite nice, but 4 songs for $18 is not good value.... I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this for my husband for his birthday.... I just didn't even think that any CD nowadays would have so few songs.... Buyer beware.."
2,Explains the Success of MP3 File Sharing Sites,"Nice collection of traditional music with an other-worldy sound.The fact that you get only 6 songs for $23 seems odd. I did some searching, and GoMusic.RU has the album for $0.81. That, by contrast, seems too low, but I can live with it."
1,Cheap junk,"I know you get what you pay for, but I'm baffled by the good reviews for this piece of junk. I've owned mine for two years, and all I can say is:-- Images everywhere up and down every band including FM. I hear the same FM station in three places in a 200 mHz span.-- Drift is amazingly bad and constant adjustment of the tuning is required, even on strong stations. Listening to a baseball game on even the strongest AM stations is a chore.-- Shortwave is awful: If you want to hear the strongest shortwave broadcasters on U.S. soil splattering up and down most of the bands, buy one of these."
3,"WRX911 Nice little radio, but . . . .","This is a nice looking little radio - extremely compact. It worked fine on all bands, but the frequency calibration on the shortwave bands was so far off as to make the dial meaningless. I returned it for a refund and bought a Grundig G6 Aviator instead."
3,"Some good, some bad","The Good:Decent S.W. receptionFast dial sweepEasy to carry and has pouchNice stereo earbudsHandy ""tuned in"" lightGood sound, good volumeThe Bad:Flimsy compared to the Kaito 1103 that I was used toDial numbers are quite off on FM dialNo BacklightNo CB Band, no 50-55MHz S.W. bandThe volume dial does not click radio off - disturbingSometimes needs to lie against (or flat on) an object for better receptionBurned out batteries fast when played at high volumeNo jack for external antenna...hope this helps."
3,Okay for the money.,"This receiver is just OK. I use it primarily indoors, and so I don't get great shortwave reception. I was a little disappointed about that. However it picks up AM/FM stations great...just not what I bought it for."
2,Overloads on FM band,"PROs: earbuds included, as is a cloth drawstring bag. Appears to be well built. Tuning just a little stiff, but no backlash. The blue color is a little garish but I wouldn't care about the color if it worked better.CON: The FM station I want to listen to is completely wiped out by other strong FM stations in this area. I'm not asking it to do the impossible, other inexpensive radios are able to pick up the FM station I want to listen to OK at the same location. The performance on the AM broadcast band is OK, and it picks up some Short Wave Stations. In comparing it to the Kaito KA321 (see my review of that item): the shortwave reception on this one is MUCH better, but the FM reception is MUCH worse. I guess when you pay $20 for a radio what you get is a $20 radio. At any rate, thanks to Amazon's return policy I'm sending it back for a full refund."
3,Solid Radio,"AM/FM reception is decent. Sound quality from the built-in speaker is good and relatively loud for this small package. I haven't explored ShortWave much, but I don't seem to be receiving many stations with the built-in antenna. This unit comes with a input jack for an external power adaptor but does not come with the adaptor. Runs on two AAs."
4,Affordable. Good Reception with some Fine Tuning.,"Great little gizmo. The reception has been decent, but helps if you add some aluminum foil with an elongated wire hanger attached for better reception. For the price, it's a decent shortwave radio. I find the aluminum foil helps, even if it looks a bit clumsy and cumbersome. I am able to pick up all kinds of stations, even in other countries. For someone new to shortwave radio, I would definitely recommend this radio."
4,Great Radio,"This radio is wonderful. The reception is great. I was able to get stations from Taiwan, China, Japan, Sweeden, Britain, Germany, many Spanish speaking countries and lots of morse code, too. If you want to hear worldwide broadcasts, this is for you."
4,REMEMBER THE SONY?,"Twenty-five years ago, Sony made 'em this way, and even then, the Sonys were more expensive.This baby puts the world back in your hands.Exceptional value."
1,Don't waste your money,It's a good looking radio but the reception is terrible. The local am radio stations sounded like they were far away with a great deal of background noises. Don't waste your money.
2,"some nice pictures, but text is indeed fluff.","An example of fluff would be his treatment of the carpenter, mercury 7 flight. There was more to it then ""as he twirled around in space....his fuel began to run out"". Read carpenters book, ""for spacious skies"", or slayton's ""deke!'. don't pay attention to chris craft's ""flight""."
2,"Good pictures, some mistakes","The book has a lot of pictures but not too much historical accuracy. Like the flight of the ""K-15"" or the Russian space dog ""Latka"" or ""Steve Yeager"", the first man to break the sound barrier.Oh yes, and not one word about Apollo 13."
4,Theory Is Ah-ight!,"Voices Of Theory is an up and coming group with similarities to Boyz II Men, Force M.D.'s, Blackstreet, Troop(old skool), Shai, Coming Of Age, A Few Good Men and KAI. What ever happen to some of those groups?Groups that can really blow. They may sound like Boyz... because their manager is Michael ""Bass"" McCary. He also co-wrote and produced a few of the songs. I want to go out on a limb and give props to the ""Bass"" man. Yo Mike, when are you going to hook up with Keith Martin again? This album is pretty tight. A lil' bit of R&B, Soul, Jazz, Latin, and Pop. All and all I give this CD four stars. Check out tracks 5,6,8,9, and of course track 4 which is ""Say It"". I gave it 4 stars 'cause it's lacking me, Jon P.Peace..."
2,Mediocre,"While the debut single, 'Say it,' is outstanding and dripping with heartfelt emotion, the rest of this album dwells in the land of mediocrity. None of the other songs truly stand out, and one of them even features Kurupt of all people over a SLOW beat. His appearance is truly unbearable and shallow, and serves to pull this album even further down into the ever-expanding region of everyday R+B acts with little future."
5,Theory Is Ah-ight!,"Voices Of Theory has a cool and relax CD. I really don't want to compare them to Boyz II Men, CMB, or any other group. They have their own style in a way. With an R&B, Jazz, and a lil' Latin flava. I just wanted to make a comment on the so called fan from Toronto. I figure he or she doesn't look at the credits much. Guess who produced most of the songs? ""Michael ""Bass McCary"" A member of BIIM. ""So get back music fan from Toronto!"" He is also the manager of VOT. I give this group much props..."
5,I give them 5 stars I love the cd they are #1 on my list!!!!,When I first heard Voices Of Theory the song say it had came on the radio I loved it I am a there #1 bigest fan!!!!I lisen to them in spanish and english.They are so hot! They are five hot looking guys that are so fine!!!!!!.They sing from the heart. They really know how to treat there woman.I hope they can be at number1 because they know how to sing and they are so HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! love ya forever Voices of Theory!!! your number1 fan Natasha Durazo!!
5,The best love album I've heard so far,The lyrics of the songs are very romantic and I couldn't wait to own their cd. Those guys have awesome voices and I would really like to hear more of them.
5,Panasonic KX-TGA571S,I bought this unit to add to the other two I have. This unit connects easily and is easy to use. The range is excellent and the clarity is great. I can easily work out in the garage or yard with no problems. The intercom feature is very useful too. I recommend this product!
3,Nice Idea,"This phone is an expandable handset to the KX-TG5776S. I was going to return the phones but I purchased it on Amazon.com through seller ""Globazar"" and their return policy indicates a 15% restocking fee> Rather than be charged the restocking fee, I decided to keep the phones. I purchased them in December, 2008 after phones were discontinued. The phonebook can be copied from one phone handset to the other. You can download pictures and sound to the phone and assign it to names in your address book. I was able to copy phonebook to other handsets but was not able to copy the pictures that was assigned to the names. This phone has some nice features but as others indicated, ""missed call"" is displayed even when phone calls are picked up."
3,The directions are a joke!,"I actually got a Migraine trying to figure out these phones. The direction booklet is written in ant script and after using my magnifying glass, I still didin't know anything. It took me about a week to finally figure out that the button in the middle could be pressed in all directions instead of just forward - they don't bother to tell you that. Anyway, after I got the phone down pat, I think it's cool. But, hey, I know I could write a better direction booklet! After figuring out this phone, I think I could do anything."
1,Amazon return policy is STINKO!!,"Got ripped off on a refund through Amazon. Paid $45 for a cordless phone and had to add $10 to ship it back. Out of the $55 I had into this, I received a $32 return!! The add I clicked on to buy the phone was misleading... it did NOT say the phone was an extension only and would not work without a base unit!! I will not be using Amazon or ANYonline ever again!!"
2,Corporate Greed run wild,"This is probably the seventh or eighth Panasonic phone system that I've bought. It's also probably the last. They have stopped including the mounting for wall mounts and the belt clips in the box. Furthermore, when you call for them they expect you to pay an arm and a leg for them PLUS shipping & handling. What Nerve! Oh, the phone works but you don't want to have more than one 5.8 in the same house. They give eachother static.I hope this helps."
4,"Great Phones, Weird Shape","These make great phones and work well with the main base station (Panasonic KX-TG5776S). My biggest gripe about them is their shape. They are incredibly difficult to hold between you head and shoulder when you just don't have a free hand. Luckily, it has a speakerphone which works rather well.The battery can hold a charge for several days, maybe even a week.Overall, it is a good phone for your house. I plan to buy more to fit into the expandable system (see the base station Panasonic KX-TG5776S)."
3,Written as an own experience,"This book would be recommended for begginers, people who have no idea about pre-production, production and post production of commercial making. However, if you are not a beginner and got more experience and understanding in the filmmaking terminology, perhaps you would prefer more advanced books."
2,"Bland book, and so-so information","I had to use this book a little while back for a ""commercial production"" class. The book is really only for the biggest beginners, as the information is really unspecific and watered down. There are definitely better choices in books out there, and really it goes without saying: you can't learn how to make a commercial from reading a book. You must actually make one, and then make another and another to develop your skills.Unless you are forced to purchase this book for school, I would definitely pass. It's not the worst book out there, but there is better, free information available online for those wanting to shoot commercials."
3,Decent overview...,"The author talks extensively about who is responsible for which tasks and who else (agency, producer, etc.) will be involved in each part of a production. Some detail is provided about different techniques used when shooting commercials, but certainly not exhaustive. If you plan to make commercials for a career, this book is a good read. If you are just making a commercial, it's still somewhat helpful in spite of the abundance of advice on managing the producer/director/client/agency relationships."
3,Word Book,I thought this book was ok. My 2 year old son likes it but it he always turns to the pages he likes such as the page with cars or especially the candy page. The book wasn't very organized and had a lot of words that he or even I would hardly ever use. I recommend My Big Word Book and First 100 Words (see my reviews on these books).
1,EXCELENT product. Don't buy from FraganceNet!,"I have used this product for over 15 years. I've always liked it because of its refreshing smell, the hold and texture it leaves my hair with. For these reasons, the product has always been a 5+ star.Now I'm giving a low rating to the seller (FraganceNet), not the product, because the product they sent me has a very strange and unpleasant smell. It smells moldy... the way it smells in places where it's always damped and closed... e.g. Under sink cabinets.I highly recommend this product, but don't buy it from FraganceNet.I've previously purchased this same product directly from Amazon.com and been very pleased with it."
5,Gelwhip by Image- Conditioner,"I love Gelwhip! It is the only conditioner I've used that conditions hair and reduces frizz simultaneously. I have very dry hair so don't wash my hair everyday. With many gels, hair becomes hard. But not with Gelwhip. You can just spritz it the next day and it is soft. And now my coworkers have started to use it too. In fact, when I came across the border into Canada and the border guard asked if i had anything to declare, I replied, ""Three litres of Gelwhip."" He said, ""Must be aufully good gel."" I said, ""yes, the best! """
5,Roddy-Riffic!!,"Hello! Awesome album, very solid all the way through, and doesn't become boring like alot of Death Metal albums can. My favourite songs would have to be Masturbating the War God, and Multitude of Foes, the latter which took Dallas Toler-Wade about a year to arrange!However, I am really writing this just to clear something up. Alot have been praising Pete Hammoura's drum work on this album, and while he is a great drummer, it may interest you to know that the only song he actually played on this album was 10 - To Dream of Ur. The rest of the albums drumwork was taken care of by the legendary Derek Roddy. He had never heard the material, and yet, managed to get every track down in just 27 hours!! Awesome work, and he is very often overlooked, as the album just credits him as playing 'Additional Drums'. WTF? Pete Hammoura played ONE song, therefore, making him the one who filled in some 'Additional Drums'. Just wanted to clear that up, that's all."
4,This is a really good album.,"This thing is awsome. Most of the songs are written in a egyptian(harmonic minor) key to provide atmosphere. The guitar playing on this album is out of hand. Its soo fast yet complicated everytime I listen to a song I catch somthing new. The drumming is very fast and relentless too. And the vocals are also powerful. Fortuniatly this album isnt pure death metal, there are calm tracks with ancient middle eastern instumentals. The liner notes are also very interesting. All in all a solid release, it gets 4 stars though because it isnt a masterpeice."
2,I've tried and tried and tried and tried....,"...but I just can't understand why this album has gotten so much attention. Sure, it heavy as hell, very technical, and has some very original imagery and lyrics, but the music just isn't that special! Nile's previous album caught my attention with the attempt to create ""Egyptian""-style death metal, and I recognized a lot of potential, but ""Black Seeds.."" is very unlistenable. It might deserve more than 2 stars because, for what it is, it IS a solid effort. They create many layers of sound to sort though, but it just isn't very original and ear-catching musically. I feel it by no means should have been voted album of the year by so many critics. If you want to listen to 30+ minutes of superfast guitar, drums at neck-breaking speeds, and undecipherable deep grunts, there are a ton of albums to choose from. I just don't think this one stands out among others."
2,A good idea poorly executed.,"I hate to give this band a poor review because I can see that they have potential. The good aspects of this album are their use of Egyptian instruments in order to create interesting atmospheres. Some of the riffs are pretty good, especially those on ""The black flame"". The lyrics are also interesting. One problem is that many of the song titles are overthought and just downright ridiculous. The main problem with this band is that they play so fast that their music just hits a solid wall of noise. I think it would be better if the band slowed down and added more grooves to their music. Overall, this is a major disappointment."
5,Nile Are Gods,"Black Seeds Of Vengeance is a great album,but mind you it is NOT a death metal album,it is Black Metal,Difference they have egyptian music in the back Black Metal uses music other than guitars and drums they used sound effects and what not,Nile is one of the greatest BLACK METAL bands,Buy this CD or burn in the sands of Sahara"
1,PURE GARBAGE,"i bought this title a couple of days ago based on the recommendations of my friends and several reviews posted here. saying that i was incredibly dissapointed and somewhat angered at having spent money on this worthless garbage would be an understatement. words like awesome, powerful, hardcore, and great were the furthest things from my mind when i listened to this CD. Based on the other reviews i would say that these guys have figured out how to cover-up their complete lack of talent by banging their instruments really fast and appealing to those that consider metal played with any kind of talent too 'mainstream' for them. If ur looking for a good death metal band try morbid angel or napalm death, if u wan't to waste ur money and know nothing about music, then nile is for you...."
1,Awful... just awful,"I am an emphatic death metal fan. I've seen tons of bands live, and own hundreds of CDs in the genre--some of the best and worst. I must say that this CD falls in the latter category. It's pure trash. This is not music; it's noise. The vocals are boring and completely incoherent (as opposed to say, Cryptopsy), and to sum it up briefly, the CD is basically a large, unorganized amorphous that isn't going anywhere. There's really no technicality here. It's just play play play, and hopefully something good will come out of it. It's very similiar to Morbid Angel. The songs are just played, not felt.Want some real death metal? Go with Suffocation's ""Pierced from within,"" Cryptopsy's ""Whisper Supremacy,"" either album by Carnal Forge, Napalm Death's ""Inside the Torn apart,"" Deicide's ""Once upon the Cross,"" or for more purity, try Vader's ""De Profundus.""AIM - Infinity Driven"
1,To much drama,"I bought the CD to hear some crazy music, but I felt like I was watching an old cheap B grade horror movie. The song titles are absolutly stupid, it is embarrassing telling people what these song titles are, they are like a sentence long and make no sence, the lyrics fall off quick, nothing here, you would have more fun reading about the subject this band tries to put out, but is sorry in doing so. I buy a CD for the music, not to fall asleep to it, this sucks."
2,good but eh...,"This album definitely doesn't top Annihilation of the Wicked. Keep in mind, I'm very critical so Nile fanatics are sure to love it as It is not a bad album. Honestly, my only issue was the production. The drums weren't as loud and pronounced as I thought they should have been, since George (drummer) is also a contributing talent in this phenomenal band."
5,Absoltely intense!,"You know I think it is so great when a new band comes out and defies what has been predetermined about a death metal band, that this genre of music is played out. That it's overdone and pretty much dead. Nile pushes the boundaries of extreme music to the next level. The mixture of ancient egypian music and pure brutal death metal is an insane combination. Karl Sanders has an awesome low guttural sounding voice. Not to mention the guitar playing on this album is insane. And the drumming? My god, some of the fastest blast beats and rolls I've ever heard. Id' say that Derek Roddy and Pete Hammoura (I think that is how it is spelled, lol) are right up there with death metal drumming legend Pete Sandoval. I mean I am a death metal guitarist/vocalist myself, so how could I not love this album!? This CD is a display of sheer brilliance and definitely originality. Highly recommended for any death metal fan. I would give this CD 10 stars if I could."
2,This one definately kept me and left me confused,"Don't get me wrong- this book was good and all, I read it in 3 days, but now that I think about it, the only reason that I couldn't put the book down was because I was trying to figure out the whole purpose of it all. When I finished it, I felt unsatisfied."
2,It was a strange book,I did not like this book. It did not appeal to me at all. Would not recommend this book as a good book.
2,Just so sad.,"The whole book is a downer. Which, considering the subject matter, I suppose it's meant to be. I honestly didn't really enjoy it. It was hard to get through, emotionally, as the mother to two small children. The abuse is horrible and vile and described in great detail. I had to put it down and do something distracting quite often while reading this because of the overwhelming depressing feelings it created. And while I understand that forgiveness is great, I felt like the main character was very weak and flawed in that she HAD to forgive her father to get on with her own life. She used her past as a crutch and that's just so very depressing to me. So, spoiler alert, in the end nothing grand happens. She just forgives her father right before he dies and then it ends and that's that. We don't know if she goes on to do great things or if her life stays stagnant."
5,The Warmest December,Very well written book. Handled very sensitive emotions so they seemed very realistic. Didn't want to put the book down. Glad it turned out the way it did.
5,what a story,we aren't bad people trying to become good. we are sick people trying to get well. forgivess is so important in the process.
2,Too depressing,"When I am into reading a book, I like to be to look forward to what happens next. There have been way too many recovering from ""something"" books. We all have our stories and it's time to move on to another subject. Congratulations to her for forgiving her father, for overcoming her addictions, but keep it to yourself. Rejoice in what you have accomplished internally. Sorry I wish it was better reading, but every page was just like the one before."
3,Too depressing,"This book explicitly details the negative and dark world of alcoholism and the abuse associated with it. The author is very detailed with different abuse incidents and as the reader you feel your are right there witnessing it yourself. However, this book was far too depressing for me. Mc Fadden is one of my favorite authors but I can't say this was one of my favorite books."
5,Heart-Touching,"This novel tells the story of Kenzie, a young lady who endured physical and emotional abuse by father Hy-lo, along with her mother, Della, and younger brother Malcolm. Your heart goes out to her and the family as she tells the story of how it all began, and we begin to realize where it ends up. You wonder if Kenzie grows or does she remain forever trapped by the what she had to endure all of her life. There is tragedy, pain, and heart ache as Kenzie tells each story, and my heart went out to not only her, but Malcolm and Della as well. I hated for the story to end, because Kenzie was finally able to make peace in a way that only God could give you. There is a lesson to be learned from this story."
5,The Warmest December!!,"This was a great book! I loved this book! Even though the storyline was sad - it was a wonderful story....It's about a woman that has grown up hating her alcoholic father. The story unfolds describing the abuse that her family suffered day in and day out at the hands of the father - abuse that was so real, the mother and the daughter become alcoholics themselves....I can't say enough about this book....Read It!"
4,Very moving,"Enjoyed this book a lot. Very well written and engaging. For any person that has an addict in their family, it's a must read."
5,Fantastic!,This story was amazing! Very poignant and real. I cried through parts and cheered through parts. I am looking forward to reading more by Ms McFadden.
3,Informative But Needs More of a Storyline,"This review was written for LibraryThing Early Reviewers.This book pulls you in immediately, and I read it quickly. Somehow, it came up short of what I expected. Perhaps it was because I felt like the entire tale took place inside of Kenzie's mind, and never really got far from it. It seems obvious that the author has had at least some experience with alcoholism, and those descriptions are very believable. I felt that the ending should have been more developed, too, and was left wondering what happened to the rest of the characters in the story.I would still recommend it, though, and I will try reading one of the author's other books to compare to this one; she is a very talented writer."
5,Nice easy read.,"This is a nice book. Emotion is thick if you can relate to the subject matter. If you can't, she gives you a very vivid picture."
5,Excellent Writer,"As I expected, The Warmest December is a very gooood book. Bernice McFadden can tell a story. When I started this book, I couldn't put it down until I finished the entire book. The theme reminded me of Gal, by Ruthie Bolton. Can't wait for her next one. Thanks for a well written book."
2,Flat!,"I like the writings of Bernice McFadden, but this isn't one of them. It is a very detailed story of the pains and misery of alcoholics. The author explicitly describes the torment and affliction of the disease. I think she did a great job with that, but the overall reading of the book was a chore. I think Ms. McFadden was bending the elbow when she wrote this one; it's not one of her best. She as done much better."
2,Awful!,This book is a horror! I couldn't finish it. It is a chronicle of abuse that does not let up. Enough already!! I understand the author is trying to tell a story about abuse but after 30-40-50 pages of it you are numb. I have no idea what the story was.l
5,This Book Deserves the Highest Praise,"Exceptionally well written and thoroughly engaging, The Warmest December is a page turner that has the power to heal those whose lives have been affected by child abuse. So many feelings of loss and pain described pull at the hearts of those who have been unable or unwilling to put words to their own experience. Read it and take a journey that will allow you to understand healing."
5,"comprehensive, yet very rich review",All the chapters provide a excellent review for different aspects of thee research on working memory. Major authors summarize the state of art in different subdomains.
1,Will NOT PLAY on PS2,"Someone should be fired for that,,, morons. Am I the only one using a PS2 to watch movies,,, I think not! It's a shame since it is one of the greatest series ever!"
1,An open wound is funnier...,"This series really merited a rank of zero stars but that option wasn't offered. Cretinish, low-brow humor, nasally irritating voices and tiresome characters that are grindingly unwatchable. I jump for the remote to change channels even when the commercials come on. Turn the TV off if this is all that's on."
1,"GREAT show,,,,, but,,,",Am I the only one who uses a Playstation2 to watch DVD's?!? Now I have to buy a DVD player just to see these hilarious treasures. Feh
2,A Simpsons Rip-Off!!,"I just heard that Fox is bringing this show back on the air in 2005. Why?! This show is just a rip off of The Simpsons! I kid you not, many of the jokes in the first season were shamelessly stolen from the Simpsons. For example, on many occasions, Dale suddenly and very quickly falls to the ground, but this is a joke that was done on the Simpsons a hundred times! When I first saw this on Family Guy I didn't laugh but rolled my eyes instead.This is not where it stops. Even the circus themed opening credits came from one of the opening themes of a Simpsons episode!If I want a laugh, I'll watch the Simpsons. If I want racy comedy, give me South Park. If I want to see the same jokes years later that I've seen so many times they arn't funny anymore, Family Guy takes the gold!"
2,Grotesque and Childish,"It's best jokes are funnier than the jokes on ""The Simpsons"". That, I'll give this credit for. But, like its predecessor, the show is overly grotesque.If you want to see some intellegent comedy, with bite to it, that has something to say, check out ""Mr. Show"". This and the Simpsons are just childish - geeky cartoons that aim to be hip while wallowing in a misery and ennui that mirrors the slacker generation, but in a pathetic way."
4,The Classic Family Guy Dilemma- Stewie or Brian.........,For those who haven't seen this show you are missing out. This is animation at it's funniest. All 6 major characters are well thought out and written with gusto. The supporting characters are hilarious once you get familiar with them. It was a shame this show was cut short. It's pretty risque but it pays off bigtime. Stewie the baby is my favorite. He is a baby with a sort of a mad-scientist meets Frasier Crane persona who works that English accent to the utmost levels of extreme snobbiest. The show is politically incorrect so if you are offended by that sort of stuff stay away. My only complaint is that Peter the father is a poor mans Homer Simpson who's predictable antics sometime get a little tiresome. Other than that is high quality DVD with some OK extras and semi interesting commentaries.Bottom Line: Family Guy aint for families but it's friggin hilarious. Hopeless ubergeek Simpsons worshippers (myself included) should love this.
1,No More Family Guy on DVD!,"Fox is wasting money and time releasing Family Guy on DVD! The show should have ended during the writers strike. I hope many people realzie that Family Guy is really disgusting and violent. violent in animation is the last thing this world needs, because things are bad enough as it is. Please do not release anymore Family Guy DVDs!"
3,THIRD BEST SHOW BUT NOT BEST LIKE FUTURAMA AND CLERKS,"This show is hilarious but sometimes crude and boring,but the family characters like Peter,Lois,Chris,Meg,Stewie,and the families dog Brian,it has lots of laughs mostly by Peter's jokes,Lois'straight talk,and Chris' silly voice.but I like tv shows FUTURAMA AND CLERKS a whole lot better."
1,The rise and fall of western civilization,"Many years from now when someone huddled in a smoking crater asks me how it all started, I'll be sure to bring up this show. The main point of the writing seems to be to allow people of average to low IQ to feel smug and superior by presenting them with a oafish strawman, easily dismissed, and easily mocked. Want to be an off-the-shelf elitist? Want to be faux-clever? Want to have an ersatz and vague sense that you are an insider? This just may be the show for you. The humor is artless and unsubtle. The characters are presented in the most unsympathetic and border-line sadistic light. To summarize: entertainment by and for idiots."
3,A Good Compilation of an Okay Show,"This collection of Family Guy, containing two of the three seasons of the show, is an excellent compilation of the show. However, the show leaves something to be desired in its humor at times.It appears that nothing is too sacred to the writers of Family Guy. While some of their spoofs are truly funny in themselves, many jokes take advantage of situations, instututions, and individuals. In addition to these kinds of gags, Family Guy also utilizes much ""potty"" humor. The comedy of the show, while sometimes extremely funny, can leave the watcher thinking, ""Did they just make fun of that?"" and, ""That was a stupid joke.""If you are a fan of the series, this is an excellent compilation of the show. For that, I give it 5 out of 5 stars. However, since the humor is not all that great at times, I give it 3 out of 5 stars. Think what you will; it is a funny show at times, going overboard at other times, but this is an excellent collection of the episodes."
3,Overrated but ok,"even if family guy ripped off the simpsons, if you think of it as a continuation on the simpsons, it isnt too bad. Some episodes are terrible, but some come close to the simpsons. This show should never have come back on air, and is way overrated due to its unoriginal characters and plots. If you want decent, original cartoons, watch Aqua Teen, Simpsons, or my personal favorite, the underrated Home Movies, also on DVD.Ta Ta"
5,Great,this show was one of the greatest thing to happen in my life then they cancelled and i was hartbroken but now atleast they play it on the week days though there only re-runs
5,The Best Ever,"This is the funniest cartoon for adults ever made; in fact, you may accuse me of hyperbole, but it might be the funniest TV show ever made period. As far as cartoons go, it even beats out my beloved ""Bugs Bunny"" of the 40's and 50's - ""SouthPark"" and the ""Simpsons"" come in 3rd and 4th IMHO.This series is the reason I finally bought a DVD player."
3,Awesome but Interlacing problems galore!,"I love Family Guy but...These DVDs have crazy interlacing problems. I've tried it on my computer and two seperate DVD players! Not all of an episode has interlace artifacts but where there are parts, they are REALLY bad. I wonder if Fox will re-release this DVD and fix it?"
3,Missing Episodes!?!,"I love the Family Guy, and I'm happy that they came out with the series on DVD, since the show has been canceled. However, there are two episodes that I loved that were the basis of my decision to purchase this, AND THEY'RE MISSING!!! Where is the Spoof of Willy Wonka (the one with the Beer factory and the Chumbawumbas?), and the Christmas Episode where Stewie plots against the evil Clause?"
2,The Show is Merely OK,"Some of the bits are funny, but I just can't simply love this show no matter what. It relies far too much on beer drinking, farting and burping - and doesn't have the heart of The Simpons or the wit of King of the Hill. It tries to be witty by splicing in several references to 70's and 80's pop culture but these always feel forced and trivial. Many of the characters are plain annoying (Peter and Chris) while others are under-developed (Meg). Stewie is fairly funny but he's kind of a one note song (does the same things over and over and uses the same lines in every episode like 'what the deuce!'..funny the first time but repetitive very quickly). Brian the Dog can be VERY funny and simply needs more screentime as the Griffin Family's alcoholic pooch. 2 stars for some moments of levity."
4,good show...,"Family Guy is a good show, but it reminds me a lot like The Simpsons, you have Peter(Homer), Louis(Cant spell the Simpsons girls name)..Chris(Bart),Megg(Lisa) and Stewie(Meggie)...Peter and Homer both like Beer and TV..and they can be a bit rude. Lous and Simpson's mom work. Chris and Bart I dont really see much for them Lisa and Megg not much Megs a bit unpopular..and Stewies more evil and Meggie looks like she would turn out to be a sweet girl...Dont get me wrong I love Family Guy but its so much like the Simpsons, Its a funny show and all dont get me wrong."
2,Bad DVD,After waiting patiently for this DVD to come out I'm starting to see that it won't be as great or complete as I'd expected. While it will be great to have one the best t.v. shows in history on DVD..I've yet to see that the Christmas episode is included with this set and that was definately during the first two seasons! From what I've read: The US version will NOT have all the first and second season episodes..some are likely held back to bundle in the second set..this of course means more(not necessary)waiting time! Go to Family Guy Files and check it out. And it's been censored no matter what..I know the UK says the DVD is uncut but apparently Fox removed some material(Bin Laden)BEFORE sending it to the BBFC for them to review so it was never technically censored by them.
5,Far better then the Simpsons,"This show is far superior to the simpsons. I can see how many can see it as similiar. Though it may be the joke are far funnier and the episodes are far better. I have all the seasons and I show them to familly every time they over, and the all love it too. For those of you thinking the simpsons is better, relize like southpark did that the Simpsons has done everything and is getting old."
5,Holy Crap!(By Joey),"Family Guy rules!!! Peter Griffin,the fat obnoxious drinker is a complete idiot! Once in an episode in season 3""Mr.Saturday Knight"" a girl said would you like to take a gander under my skirt. Peter gets a gander and sticks it up her skirt!! LOL!! Chris Griffin a moron who is dumber than his father! Meg Griifin is an unpopular girl at school who is emberassed by her parents. Louis the mom who is nice and she actually drinks and says VERY knotty words but sounds block them. Brian the dog who drinks alchohol & talks but only my favorite character can understand him nunother than STEWIE GRIFFIN! Stewie is a knotty baby just watch the show!!(...)"
4,Family Guy Vol.1 & 2,Good video. Have only been watching Family Guy for a short while.Good to see the beginning of when the show started.
4,"Great Show, but Nothing Special About the DVD","For anyone who hasn't seen Family Guy, this is a rare look into a surburban family just as dysfunctional as mom and pop back home.Peter, the clueless patriarch, is married to a knockout redhead named Lois (""It not the great rack or the caboose - it's that big sexy brain of yours."" -Peter), whom their neighbor Quagmire is always after. Their kids Meg and Chris are both losers, which makes them all the more relatable. Brian, the talking dog, is more of a father figure than Peter, even with the dog's love of booze.Stewie, the baby of the family, is by far the funniest character. Farther into the series, he really develops and isn't just the baby trying to kill Lois. If you're looking for more Stewie action, Season Three is definitely Stewie's heyday.WARNING: This DVD set has basically no special features - unless you count ""Animated menus""."
5,Another great comedy from FOX,"I just can't get enough of FOX's classic comedies (Married..with Children, Malcolm in the Middle, Arrested Development, etc.) and Family Guy ranks with some of the finest. Its over-the-top humor gets me every time; it's just dumb and unsophisticated, and I like that during the nine o'clock hour. Get this DVD set, you'll laugh so hard that you might just have a heart attack."
2,only funny for adults,I love family guy on tv so i started off with season 1-2. It's not like the ones on tv now. My mom thinks it's funny but my friend and i just dont get it. Sometimes it's only a little funny but i'm just sitting there waiting until i find the right episode. I think if you're young get the later seasons.
5,Family Guy Series,The product was sent in a timely matter. I ordered it the monday before Christmas and was surprised it was received before. The product was fine and cheaper than anywhere else I priced. I was well pleased.
5,Funniest Cartoon Ever,"I believe Family Guy is the funniest cartoon ever aired, and this DVD backs up my statement. I'll never forget one episode when Peter wins the Golden Ticket to go into the local Beer makers factory(much like Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory which the episode was obviously based on) and when he finds the ticket everyone around him tells him to run home, but the funny part about it is how he ran so far, and he finally gets to the front of his house and then he trips and falls after running all that way. I just thought that was so funny, and that's why all the episodes were so funny because of humor like that."
5,"Watch it, please","I bought this because people said it was funny and I already have the other Simpsons tapes. I popped in the first episode. It was at about the time when the whole family screams ""Oh No!"" and the KoolAid guy bursts through the courtroom wall and says ""OH YEAH!"" that I realized this show was as good as, if not better, than the Simpsons. This show is hilarious, all the characters are great, with the exception of Chris sometime. Stewie, the 1-year-old who wants to take over the world, is arguably the funniest character from any animated show ever. The funniest parts of this show come in the flashbacks in the stories they tell, and these parts are funny and often. I bought this blind, but it defintely doesn't disappoint. 5 out of 5"
5,What the heck I'm I watching,"This is show is great. Most of the time my jaw is on the fall laughing wondering what heck am I watching, but that's what makes it so funny. And ever show I have to ask myself... Now why does the dog (Brian) talk and act like a person? And why does the baby have an accent and only the dog hears him? The show is great."
4,Family Guy,These DVDs are very funny they keeped everyone in the family entertained on our vacation where there was no tv
5,Freakin' brilliant and funny,"Only a few words can describe this: Great, brilliant masterpiece. Great entertainment for the whole family"
2,FUNNIER THAN THE SIMPSONS!!!!!?????????PLEASE,"How any one can come on here and knock ""The Simpsons"" is down right disrespectful, to a classic. Where family guy fails the simpsons succeed. This show was funny at times, but not funnier than the simpsons, homer is considered a friggin' icon, and people are gonna come on here and compare Peter to him. unlike Peter i actually care about Homer. I am glad they took this trashy show off the air, just a simpsons knockoff, and fails. The simpsons, made parody's that were actually funny, and paid tribute to classic shows, movies, and music, and made them funny. And its viwers stay loyal to the show."
1,Just not funny.,"The only good thing about this show is the baby. Other than that, I can't NOT recommend this series enough. Unless you're a big fan of toilet humor and characters who desperately WANT to be Homer Simpson, but fall sadly short, that is... Don't bother with this."
5,"So fun funny, so mindless, so awesome!","Family Guy is one of the funniest shows ever created and is probably the most underrated comedy that was ever on tv. It is so funny, with so many different jokes in every single episode. The Simpsons is the best cartoon ever, no doubt. But Family Guy is funnier! The Simpsons just have better storylines (after 16 seasons, you should). Family Guy's cast of hilarious and idiotic Rohde Island residents will keep you laughing until you can't breathe. From Quagmire, a sexy beast, to Stewey, a brialliant young mind, determined to murder his mother, you'll never be without a laugh. It also has the most one liners from any show ever (except for the Simpsons, of course). With some especially hilarious episodes exclusively on this dvd, this is definitely a must-buy!"
5,The best DVD's I ever bought,Without a doubt Family Guy is the best cartoon show EVER. Its a shame that it got cancelled.
3,"This show is good, but over rated","I have watched every episode on this DVD set and I'll admit it is a good show, it is not in my opinion brilliant as some reviews have said. It has some laughs, but the characters have no credibility and I found it hard to get into the episodes with the constant flashbacks. I just couldn't believe on average the show received a 4 1/2 star rating here on amazon, but it is worth watching."
5,Family Guy kicks ass,How dare anybody give it less than 5 stars!?Family guy is the BEST show EVER....and mila kunis is hot
5,awsomely awsome movie,"this is a great collectin of family guy shows. I had gotten this from my mom for christmas and have watched it about 20 times already and i still love it. It has all 7 episodes of season 1 and it also has all 21 episodes of season 2. I have had absolutely no problems with the dvds so far. my favorite episode on season one is i never met a dead man and on season two i am peter, hear me roar. those are two very humorous episodes that i actually have watched about 10 times a each."
3,"I LOVE IT, BUT....","I bought it for the show...and I think the show is the best animated comedy EVER!Now, having said that, I am extremely disappointed in the ""on the cheap"" commentary segments. I wish they had gone into the studio a little more prepared with something to say. I felt like the Seth, David and Alex were just watching along with me. PROBLEM WAS, I couldn't hear the program when they didn't speak...all I heard was them watching...and breathing...and waiting. WHO NEEDS THAT??? Hire an audio mixer.I Feel that a lot of DVD commentaries suffer from this problem. I say, if you're gonna hype me with extra 'goodies"" like a director's track, then PLEASE make it audible and thought out.Most of us know that a good portion of a studio's income from a film comes from videos and DVDs. Put a little money into them, will ya?"
3,"Great show, lousy dvd","This is an amazing show that is hilarious over and over again. However when I viewed the dvds I was very disappointed. While the picture quality is good most of the time, the encoding is so bad that the image frequently becomes fuzzy and any quick movements are blurry and ""stripy"" (including the movements of their mouths). Maybe if we all write to Fox and complain they will issue a higher quality dvd. One worth inclusion in my dvd library."
5,Great service,"I myself do not like this show. BUT my son loves it. Definately not a ""family show"". So if this is the kind of show you like, then it is for you."
4,Good Night,"We love family guy and its a really good show to watch before going to bed, that way you dont get all into a tv episode or movie."
4,Funny Stuff,"Like the simpsons, but often goes a step further into the realm of wrongness. Very funny.I found the second season less consistantly humorous than the first and third, but still pretty good.I'd recommended this to anyone."
5,Stewie Rules,"The first two seasons of family guy were awesome, Edgier than the simpsons and funnier than everything on televison. There was nothing sacred to Peter and the clan but the star of the show is baby Stewie, his multitude of attempts to kill Lois or supervent her authority are priceless, in later seasons this running joke has been deminished as has peters war with the chicken. All appearing for the first time in this volume. There are only 7 episodes for the first season as it was an experiment that they didn't think the world would love. The second season is 21 episodes long and make up tapes 2-4 of this box set. Watch it with the subtitles on to discover phrases aren't what you think you hear, especially from stewie. The jokes are crude and sometimes tasteless but the majority of them are pop references that everyone can relate to. Family Guy Rules!"
4,Fricken Hillarious but not perfect...,"Watching these DVD's just pisses me off. This show was so funny, yet it was canceled. Every show I like seems to get the chop. Oh well... At least I can watch them over and over now. This show WILL make you laugh. No question.I would've given the disc 5 stars but the extras were pretty weak. Commentary? Blah. I'm not really fond of people talking over the material I'm watching(even if they are the creators). And that's really it as far as extras go...Buy it, you'll love it. I promise."
5,best DVD EVER!!!!!!!,Family guy is the greatest show ever... when they stopped airing it i cried several nights.... ...just recently i have bought the dvd... this is easily the best show on television right behind the simpsons.. this dvd is well worth the [price]... because it comes with 4 dvds filled with great things such as commentary and just the show itself.. if you buy this dvd i will guarantee you that you will spend endless nights laughing and crying
4,Enlightening Commentary on a Failing Nation,"Many folks will find this material offensive; enough certainly did to remove it from Fox. However, the humor is quite brilliant, politically incorrect, and brutally honest."
5,HILARIOUS SHOW!,"the simple fact that the creators of this show haven't been struck dead is my proof that god has a sense of humor. even though this show was cancelled and offended many people, does not mean that it wasn't brilliantly written AND executed.this show was meant to offend the senses, and to knock some sense into us all about how life can get so absurd.suggestion: watch this alone for the first time so you can laugh at the parts that you may feel guilty for laughing at with others around you."
3,Scene Cut From Original Broadcasts - VERY [BAD],"I was less than thrilled when I attempted to watch the first episode, the main reason I bought this DVD Set, Road to Rhode Island, from season #2 to find that they had cut the entire Bin Laden Scene from the episode.....Nice freedom of speech America, if I had known this the DVD's would be back on the shelf at the store and I could have saved my time and money."
5,Better than I hoped...,"I actually bought this set without seeing an episode. Before you think I have money to burn, this set was recommended by everyone I knew so I gave it a shot. I tell you, I am SO happy I bought it and I wished I watched the show when it was on. There are so many priceless oneliners, great gags and hilarious writing. I love this set, it is totally un-pc but if you know they are just going for a laugh then just sit back and enjoy. This is the most cutting edge stuff I have seen on TV since All in the Family. The only way they could get away with this material is because its an animated series."
1,"Badly Interlaced, Looks Like Crap","I'm surprised that I don't see more reviews about the actual quality of the footage on the DVDs. Y'all must be viewing these on the crappiest, smallest television set in the world not to be complaining about it! The footage is so badly interlaced that you can notice it on even small, standard definition television sets. I don't see this problem nearly as bad when it airs on television. Don't buy this, you'd be better off recording it on-air and then clipping out the commercials. I might just do that myself.Aside from the dvd quality, the actual show itself I find to be quite hilarious. I bought all eight of the released volumes, but I've only watched the first one so far. I really hope the rest of them don't look this bad... Google online for ""Family Guy DVD interlacing"" and you'll find that I'm not the only person with this problem."
5,One of the Best Animated Shows Ever!!!,I loved the show when it originally came out and watched it religously; needless to say I missed the show after it was cancelled! I bought it the other day and although I remembered it was funny...i forgot HOW FUNNY the show was....I was laughing the whole way through! (The Captain Kirk portrayal is hilarious) ..and it goes on and on as far as the things that make this a Great show.....This show came and went with a Bang...NOW I OWN it!
4,great show,"Family Guy was a wonderful show for all of us who are part of its' 'cult' fillowing. I'm not sure that people take this show serious enough as a stand alone show, not a Simpsons knock off. Though there are parallels Family Guy did things as a cartoon that the Simpsons would never touch, in subject matter and satire. The witty approach that Matt Groening uses to weave his characters while making you feel attached yet amused by the characters, where as McFarlane suceeds in making characters only suitable for those with the comedic tastes of a two-year olds, such as my self. Everything about these DVDs is great except for the commentary which I found to be quite lacking in every since. Somehow this commentary stuck me as the commentary for Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, the special edition, just not very enthralling."
5,We have spoken! Let there be a 4th season!,This forty dollar DVD set has been so high as number two on the bestselling DVD charts in America. The fans and public have spoken. Bring new episodes to Cartoon Network's Adult Swim or Comedy Central. DO not let FOX steifel this show's unabashed brilliance.
4,An incomplete set,"Just a couple quick gripes about this collection: the missing unaired episode from season 2 (which hopefully will show up with the next collection), and, far more annoying to me, a good third of the episodes do not include the intro scene before the theme song. For example, in the episode ""There's Something About Paulie"", the episode begins with the theme song, then goes directly to the Mafia guys taking care of the lemon that Peter had bought during the intro! ""Peter, Peter, Caviar Eater"" does the same thing, going directly from theme song to the ""We Only Live To Kiss Your Ass"" musical number. Cutting a bit out (eg, Stewie smuggling weapons on a plane) because of sensitivity to a national tragedy is one thing. Leaving whole scenes out to (I'm guessing) fit more content per disk is just plain wrong."
5,One of the Funniest Shows EVER,"As sorry as I was to see it go, I can sort of understand why Family Guy got cancelled. The humor is certainly not for everyone, as this show feels very comfortable making fun of gays, the handicapped, child molesters, William Shatner and Adolph Hitler with equal abandon. For the easily offended or for those who think political correctness is a virtue this show is a nightmare.BUT....For the rest of us, for those who value a tear inducing belly laugh over the tender feelings of others, it's hard to find a funnier show. Even after repeated viewings every single one of these episodes makes me laugh out loud. You'll have a hard time finding better comedy than this at any price."
5,Why didn't I watch this show when it was on TV?,"This is one of those shows that sneaks up on you. Rarely watched it when it was on tv, but now in re-runs, I've found that I really missed something very funny. Off-the-wall, bizzare, and crude, the humor goes from one extreme to another."
4,A Very Funny Show,"I watched Family Guy from when it first came on in 1999 until its premature cancellation a few years later. It was a very funny show and i bought the DVD shortly after it came out. The show itself is excellent, it is a more offensive, edgy version of The Simpsons with it's own style of random humor.The extras are not great. The commentary is terrible and a waste of time to listen to, because they don't say anything particularly funny. The promos are okay, but I saw them back in 98-99. The behind the scenes featurette is pretty good, even if it is rather short.Don't try to watch to many episodes at one time, because you will get sick of it. Watch a few at a time."
5,Great Service! Great Product!,The product was receive exactly when promised and in perfect condition.
5,ridiculous price!!!!!,"it's ridculous to even ask 55 DOLLARS for this dvd it's ben on the shelf for years now and after a few years it become available at a lower price due to less demand asking the price of it;s original release date is a rip off and a disgust, got your local walmart or future shop people i got it the for 16 dollars cheaper then their second hand priceamazon you disgust me and your a horrible rip offsincerley yours truley MerLin"
3,Classic,"This is a good way to start with Family Guy, its not as good as the newer stuff but you need to get where Seth McFarlene started it all"
3,Family Guy on Air,"To the first reviewer-The Cartoon Network airs Family Guy at 10:30 p.m. (central) You may want to check on the time, but I recently discovered its revival"
5,I love this show.,"...Road to Rode Island is my fav. episode. It reaches so much. The 'Boy will your face be red when they find the black box on this one' and '1111111', '1111112', '1111113', 'what? stiff upper lip?', 'I hope Osama doesn't know show tunes', and we find out Brian's origin.I don't like how they cut the Osama part, Luckily I recorded the original..."
1,Seth McFarlane? More like Puke McRipofferton,"Hey Stewie, Jimmy Corrigan (smartest kid on Earth)called, he wants his face back. I started watching Family Guy several years ago until I realized how much random pop culture references that in no way had relevance to the plot were unfunny. Here's a setup sceneBrian: ""Hey Peter, it's hot outside""Peter: ""Hot like the time I played darts with Ghost Rider and Don King was there?""Plus my DVD player broke when I vomited all over it after 12 minutes of this tripe."
1,Blatant rip-off of,"The structure of the family is unoriginal, the title of the show took six seconds to come up with, the jokes are painfully unfunny. Don't announce that you're going to tell a joke, just tell it. The tangential movie references are completely uninspired and forced. It's really like the creator took ""The Simpsons"", removed all of the inspiration and heart and then spent no time coming up with anything original. The ""original"" components like the baby with the British accent and the dog who talks aren't funny. They seem like required changes to ensure that he's not completely charged with plagiarism."
1,Why UMD?,"First off, I want to say that the show is excellent. This show has become my all time favorite comedy. This is definitely a great series to own on DVD. It's great for DVD, but why UMD? I already own this series on DVD. Why Plunk down over $40.00 so that I can watch it on my 2 inch screen!! Not only do people have to re-buy movies they already own for the psp, but they have to pay more for the privledge of watching them on a two inch screen!! What a Rip!!"
3,Missing Episodes,"I would have given this DVD set a 5 star rating, but it apparently does NOT CONTAIN ALL SEASON 1 & 2 EPISODES.Amazon.com's info section says there are only 28 episodes, but both seasons combined actually had 37 episodes. There were 15 episodes in Season 1 and 22 episodes in Season 2. So it seems they are leaving a lot out of material, including the racier & banned from TV episodes. This is extremely disappointing considering I thought the entire point of this DVD collection was to finally give fans ALL the episodes.Hopefully when/if they release a boxset of Season 3 (which *should* contain 13 episodes), they will add the 9 episodes that are missing from this Season 1 & 2 collection."
5,"The least FOX could have done for all the ""Family Guy"" fans.","Cancelling ""Family Guy"" was a stab in the back from FOX to all the fans of this hilarious show.Family Guy combines the American satirical comedy of ""The Simpsons"" with the sick and tasteless humor from ""South Park"". Added to this, there's an originality to ""Family Guy"" of its own which makes it a very special show.Thanks to the greedy executives from FOX, ""Family Guy"" was cancelled, but at least we have this upcoming DVD, which includes audio commentaries and the banned episode ""Wish Upon a Weinstman"""
5,Stewie,If you like Family Guy then you'll like this. How could any body be disappointed with any thing having to do with Stewie right?
4,Deja Vu,"For some reason FG seasons 1 & 2 were on my review list twice, which this has been happening a lot lately and I hope Amazon realizes this. Anywho, FG is great show but I enjoy the earlier seasons better. If you're a fan, this is a good place to start."
5,Special features?,"Am I being too selfish when I want to ask for more special features on the DVDs? The show's great, hilarious....I like the commentaries, but I'd like to see some more behind-the-scenes stuff...and the same goes for Season 3...can't wait to watch the new epsiodes coming in autumn...."
5,THANK YOU CURB RECORDS!,"Someone there at Curb Records truly appreciates great music, as they have been doing a great job getting the magnificently effecting voice and music of Debby Boone back to the masses where it belongs.On this holiday collection Boone sings some classic Christmas songs using great arrangements and touches.This cd (unlike some holiday collections) is great all the waythrough. Must hears are ""Some Children See Him"" - an instant personal holiday classic, ""Christmas Time Is Here"" - another classic delivery, ""O Holy Night"" - great version of an often covered classic, and "" White Christmas"" sung with the legendary late Rosemary Clooney who just happened to be Debbys' mother in law. The two had toured for years with a Christmas concert and this gem is a way to experience first hand some of that magic. A must have for the holidays!"
3,It's O.K.,"This CD could have been better. The interpretation is O.K. Her voice is nice, but the Christmas spirit is not all that present."
2,Go home and close the door !,"As an avid DEBBY BOONE fan, I still find her vocals forever reminding me of crisp fall afternoons in 1977. However, on this collection DEBBY is overpowered by the heavy dose of LAWRENCE WELK/NELSON RIDDLE musical arrangements. The production of this CD is really not succesfull (possibly explaining the reduced price list). The duet between the late ROSEMARY CLOONEY & BOONE falls flat.On this CD, it would have been nice to hear DEBBY sing songs more lighthearted and uptempto (must everything be produced a la ""YOU LIGHT UP MY LIFE"" ?This CD is nothing more than a bad collection of granny songs dusted off to sooth drunk uncles who will not leave your home on the 26th after the parties of the 24th - 25th are over. This CD will clear out any party. A down, dull musical journey and it's too bad that DEBBY's vocal talents have been wasted on this project."
1,"Barely audible, too aggressive noise-cancelation","The noise-canceling mechanism is too aggressive to the point that the other side could barely hear me, and I have to speak louder-than-normal to be heard.It is very effective in canceling out background noises including sounds of large trucks passing-by 20 feet away, but at the expense of the speaker's own voice getting de-amplified significantly, and often canceled out if it's not loud enough.The boom has to be exactly in front of the speaker's mouth, and that's not convenient. The short boom is useless.I tested this multiple times, including calling my cellphone and recording it:1) Speak directly to the phone or speakerphone: crystal clear (Philips cordless)2) Speak through the MX505 with the long boom: too soft.3) Speak through the short boom: useless.In conclusion, if you don't mind shouting, this is perfect to cancel background noises."
4,Plantronics MX505 Headsets,"These work great for hands off phone work; helps my multi-tasking. Takes a bit to get used to them, once you adjust them they work fine."
5,Works great,"This item works great, I had to buy this extra one since I accidentally dropped an old one I had (same model) that was working great until it felt down..."
4,"Comfortable, but...","I am very pleased with this headset. Despite the odd appearance, it is very comfortable to wear -- once you can get it into place. This is not the easiest headset to get on and get positioned, but once it is on it stays put very well.Good sound quality on both hearing and speaking but the volumn in the ear piece could be a bit louder.Overall, I'm pleased with the product and would buy the product again."
3,so so,I have bought this Plantronic expecting to be better than the other $10 one I have. The cheap one sounds better than this more expensive one... Not worth the expense.
4,"Great sound, shoddy boom","The design is interesting and new, and also practical. All in all, it works great, except for fear that the interchangeable booms of different size may fall out and force you to be with an expensive earpiece. The boom itself is a solid piece of hollow plastic with a swivel joint where it removes from the earpiece, so it is limited in adjustability. The sound quality is excellent, and overall I was pleased with this purchase."
1,not compatible,it does not work well with my phone. never again to buy this kind of thing over internet because of compatibility problems.
2,Low Microphone Volume,"This is the 8th headset I have tried. Most of the ones I have purchased work very well with a cell phone, but not so good on a cordless phone. Same with this set... Very comfortable to wear. I can hear those I call really well. Those that I call need to be able to hear me too! The volume on this mic is better than most I have tried, but is still low. If you are talking to clients on the phone all day, this is important. I have a good Panasonic cordless phone and have yet to find a headset to use with it that has a strong volume. Still looking."
4,My wife can hear me...,"I purchased this one because of the wind/noise cancellation microphone. My wife can barely hear the background noise of my car when I am driving. Now I can hear her yelling more clearly and she can hear me say ""Yes dear"" with no issues. Honestly, I am glad I did my research and picked this one up."
3,Inconsistent quality,"I had the same model from Best Buy and it was great. It was stolen with my pda/phone, so I ordered another through Amazon. The new one had worse sound quality (thus 3 vs 4-5 stars). Sometimes it is better than others. Do love that I can use with either my home phone or cell phone. Not fond of bluetooth, so I put up with the cords. Comes with an extra mic boom, which came in handy because my cat chewed up the tip of the first one (don't leave out). Like the mute feature, but never used it. Like the adjustable volume control."
4,comfortable headset for cordless home phone,"I purchased this headset as a replacement. I have gone through several headsets of this type, as I work from home and am the phone quite often. The previous models I've had seem to last only a year or so, and I am hoping that this will exceed that lifetime. I wasn't sure about the 'under ear' fit, and how well it would stay on, but I am glad to say it's actually more comfortable than the 'over ear' styles.As for being ""wind smart"", I can't answer that because I don't usually use my cordless phone with my headset on while driving down the highway with my head out the window.However, for the money, this headset has met my expectations."
1,Plantronics the best but this model not that Good,Plantronics is known for making the best headsets but this model does not live up to that standard. The design is great but the clarity of voice (mic.) is low grade and the volume of voice sounds to your listener like you're talking into the mic. from another room.The purpose of this feature is to reduce background noise but I find it to not be usable for regular conversation is a quiet environment.
2,I got these for my friend and she didn't like them,"Note: I've posted this review to the pages of all products I compared (listed below):My friend was looking for a wired headset for her cell phone. She's about 5'6"" and petite. I got the 5 ones listed below for her to try out. She tried all of them, and liked only the MX150s, i.e. these:Plantronics MX150 Flexible Boom Headset with 2.5 mm PlugWhen speaking with her in her truck, the headset was once on the seat next to her yet I couldn't tell -- the sound was realy good. She also found them to be comfortable.She didn't like these 4:Plantronics MX505 Windsmart Boom Headset (Tan)Plantronics MX250 EarBud 2.5mm HeadsetJabra C500 2.5mm Mono HeadsetJabra C250 EarWave Boom Headset for 2.5mm PlugsShe said that mostly they were just uncomfortable for her. YMMV. I just bought 3 pair of thePlantronics MX150sfor myself and as stocking stuffers."
3,good and bad,"Pro: This is one of the best and most in depth books you will find on the subject.Con: It is long slow, wordy, tedious and at times goes places that strain even my open minded credulity."
2,falling apart after 6 months,"The ""Ultraglide"" sole plate is not gliding very well anymore. After getting a little starch on the sole plate a brown charred film started to form over a small area. I cleaned it with a nylon pad but now the area constantly forms this film, always the same area, and the once smooth surface is rough and irregular. Ironing dress shirts is frustrating now because the iron doesn't glide at all anymore.I never had this problem with other manufacturer's irons and I am disgusted with this iron's poor quality."
5,Best Iron Yet,"I've owned many different irons over the years. This one is the best. Easy to use, due to the ultraglide feature. Nice long cord, and the best part is its so easy to fill. You don't have to tilt it at an odd angle to fill. Just pull out the stop, and fill it from the included ""pitcher"". The last few irons I owned spit water and leaked all over the place.Definite recommendation."
1,NOT ACCEPTABLE,THE IRON DOES HEAT UP FAST AND PRODUCE A GOOD AMOUNT OF STEAM BUT IT SPITS AND SPUTTERS EVEN WHEN SET AT THE HIGHEST TEMPERATURE. IT DID IRON WELL BUT THE BURST OF STEAM FEATURE SHOT OUT A BIT OF WATER AS WELL AS STEAM. THE FINAL PROBLEM WAS THAT THE PLUG WOULD NOT STAY IN MY WALL SOCKET. I HAVE TWO OTHER OLD IRONS AND THIS WAS NEVER A PROBLEM USING THE SAME SOCKET. I WILL RETURN THE IRON.
1,Made Me Want to SCREAM!,"I took this brand new iron out of the box, filled it with tap water per intructions to iron a brand new yellow cotton dress shirt. I bursted the steam, and low and behold it deposits black dirt specks on my shirt. So I use the self-clean feature to clean out the chamber, go back to iron the shirt and the same thing happens again. This thing got the wrinkles out but deposited dirt on my shirt...brand new out of the box. Is it too much to ask for an iron that doesn't ruin your shirt while it irons it?"
1,Very Disappointing,"Was eagerly anticipating something along the lines of his previous CDs, especially the ""Right to Bare Arms""--bright, original, lough-out-loud funny--but this effort was very disappointing. Sounded as though it was was hastily put together. Very few laughs. Lackluster. My recommendation is NOT to buy."
3,Larry The Cable Guy,We took the CD with us on vacation recently and really enjoyed it. It was an anniversary gift to my husband.
3,A Lesser Effort,"I have long enjoyed ""Larry's"" lowbrow humor and, indeed, this collection is really no lower than previous efforts, but it was not as enjoyable. As with all of his work, there is a tendency towards bathroom humor and cracks aimed against the rural poor. Some of the cracks hit home but they do not do so this time around with as much fun. The collection is not mean spirited except, perhaps, against himself but it is not all that much fun either.I will still by new material released by Larry but I hope future efforts are better."
3,Fine if you don't pay full price for it,"I got this on ebay for pretty cheap, and I'm glad that I did. It's a decent mobile and my son seems to like it, but it is very basic and I wouldn't want to pay $26.00 for it. For another $10.00 you could get something that plays different music for a lot longer, has lights and a remote control, etc. Overall, it's ok but I am currently looking for something better. Maybe we'll put this one over the changing table or something..."
2,disappointing,Makes odd creaking sound and doesn't turn half the time. Considering how much they charge for this piece of plastic that is unacceptable.
3,Not very fresh,"Although this product has a nice combination of seeds for my conure, he didn't eat it. Whenever he won't eat something it's because its been sitting around. He knows an almond from a freshly opened package vs. one that I opened 2 weeks ago. And it would appear from his turning up his nose to this entire 4 lb bag that it might have been sitting around for a while too."
4,A bit disappointing . . . but the artwork is gorgeous,"Honestly, I was a little disappointed when I got MKR. I think it was mainly because the translation wasn't that great. I noticed Cephiro was spelled two different ways. I dunno. The story itself seems promising, but it didn't have that extra 'umph' that made me seek out the next volume. I gave MKR 4 stars mainly because of the artwork. CLAMP's artwork is both beautiful and unique, so that alone gets 2 stars, the story gets 1, and the extra star goes to Mokona for being so kawaii!! ^__^ I personally like Card Captor Sakura and X/1999 better,(the X/Zero Collection artbook is...gothically beautiful) but, y'know, whatever floats your boat..."
4,Amazing!,"For those of you who have just started reading this series, this review is for you. I have just started reading this first book today and I certainly swear you can't put it down. The book grabs you into a whole new dimension and has the largest imagination you can only dream of. The three girls destined to become Magical Knights are very funny and interesting. But...there is a little downside to this book. The point is, the whole story in the first book is way too rushed. It starts when the girls meet each other, and then a couple seconds after, they want to become sisters! I don't think a friendship is formed that fast. Anyways, besides that, this book is soooooo worth buying and I'm gonna order the next books in line soon."
4,It was worth the money!,The book kicked booty! I can't wait for Working Designs to make that Rayearth Video Game!!!!
4,Very interesting,This is a very interesting look at Dostoyevsky by one of the writers most similar to him in temperament...
2,Good But Too Many Loose Ends,"The book is well written and interesting but he leaves too many loose ends. Like Helen Brach's houseman. He says ""No charges have been brought,"" but fails to explain anymore. This is one of the more interesting parts. He says ""no one knows what happened to Brach,"" and leaves it hangs.Granted we don't know but he makes no attempt to wrap up loose ends. They're hanging everywhere. Granted the case is not solved to any real end. Just speculation but there isn't even notes to that.It just hangs and hangs. Everyone in the book is left hanging without the reader knowing.Good book, lousy ending"
1,deathly boring,"The author of this book performed an amazing writing feat: turning a complicated, interesting story into one of the dullest books I have ever had the misfortune to try to read. In addition to its essential boring character, I was left wondering why the author didn't bother to learn at least a few basic facts about horses before writing a book centered around horses."
1,Horrible,"Absolutely the worst rapper I have ever heard! How she has an album or is on anyone else's album is a mystery to me. She has a terrible flow, wack lyrics and an annoying voice. I wish I could give this album 0 stars."
2,SEAT SOLUTION ULTRA IS A BETTER CHOICE.,I ORDERED THE LARGE CUSHI-SEAT AND THE SEAT SOLUTION ULTRA WAS SENT INSTEAD. I LIKED IT AND ORDER ANOTHER BUT THIS TIME THE CUSHI-SEAT WAS SENT. THE SEAT SOLUTION ULTRA IS FAR SUPERIOR. IT IS THICKER AND A BETTER QUALITY FOAM. THE CUSHI-SEAT FLATTENS DOWN AND I DON'T EXPECT IT TO LAST LONG.
5,Wild Colors from Natural Sources,"I bought this book in order to learn about using natural dyestuffs. The format makes it easy for the beginner to explore natural materials available around the house and also for materials ordered from a dyers supply. Following her directions, I was able to successfully dye wool fibers using goldenrod, cochineal, logwood and daylilies from my yard. I highly recommend this book for the beginning fiber artist interested in natural dye sources."
2,Very Technical & No real recipes for home dyers,"I have this book and it is good but very technical - and the recipes are very general 4% of dye stuff to fibers dyeing etc, for which you'd need a scale...uses lots of metric calculations as well...it does give you a lot of information on a lot of different dye materials. I wouldn't recommend it for the home dyer."
2,Baking accessory,Pie pan worked well when initially used for baking but when washed in dish washer the became very rusty around flutter edeges. These results were not favorable the pan was poorly processed and I am not encourgaged to use again. I bought two I am tempted to return second pan. The pans were expensive and the rusty outcome was let down.
5,Perfect!,Exactly what my husband wanted!! The sides are deep as described. I would definitely buy this again. Three more words.
4,Great tool,This mold is well made and works great. It takes all of the work of getting the tart out of the cooking vessel.That's a plus.Does it's job very well.It's a little harder to clean than your average pie plate but not a problem. Overall great piece of cookware.
5,Perefect for Quiche,"This is a 9.5"" wide at the top and about 3"" deep fluted pan with removable bottom. It is non-stick and very easy to clean with soapy warm water. I wanted a quiche pan that was deep enough to make a thick, deep slice, that was easy to remove from the pan. This pan does that perfectly. I used the quiche recipe from thepioneerwoman.com. It was awsome. I also made a deep dish apple pie with streussel topping that was to die for! This pan is just what I was looking for."
5,A Perfect Quiche Pan,"I've been looking for a pan like this for several years. I make quiche often. The pan is professional quality, the perfect size, exactly what I wanted. I thank you, and my family really thanks you."
1,Mini quiche pan measured,"I got a set of four of these pans, took the tags off, washed them, and thought they were not deep enough. Om measuring, I found from rim to bottom they were a hair under 3/4 inches. The base of the rim and the removable bottom were about 1/16 of an inch. Bottom line is that the depth of filling to the top of the rim was close to 45/64 of an inch, leaving over 1/4 inch of the 1 inch in claimed height not existing."
3,too small for most tarts,"it was delieverd very late and it was too small for most tarts, looks very deciving in measurements given"
3,My problem is not with the pan,I have not got a problem with the pan just with the delivery time. I ordered it in may and I is not going to be delivered before August now. It does no good to have a good product if you don't deliver it on time.
5,Well worth the money,"The deep fluted tart pans are perfect for making mini tarts, giving you enough room for both the crust and filling. I love them!"
4,Perfect,This was exactly what I was looking for. I only gave it 4 stars because of the shipping. Great size for perfectly oversized pies. Replace all your pies plans with this wonderful tart mold.
2,Too Small,"This item is much smaller than advertised. it is supposed to be 4.75 x 1.1"" and actually is 4.5 x .75 . I ordered several of these for a specific purpose, but cancelled the remainder after I received the first one. Either I received the wrong item, or they are too small!"
2,not a typical Chinese movie,"So in my opnion, this movie really suck. It's not a typical Chinese movie actually, it's made for Hollywood.There is another version of this movie, someone cut all the nonsense scene from this movie and made a nonsense story. That one is funny."
3,Not an excellent Chinese film,"The plot may be good, but poorly done Chinese film that doesn't have anything good to say about and very, very uninspiring. Wouldn't recommend."
3,Snowing in April,"""The Promise (Wu Ji)"" tries too hard to sweep us off our feet with material that defies taking flight, though almost all of the characters do that very thing. Kaige Chen, director of such stunning films as ""Temptress Moon"" and ""Farewell My Concubine"" tries his level best to make this film work and there is not doubt that the visuals are stunning and that the actors, particularly Dong-Kun Jang as Kunlun ( a man from the ""Snow Land"" who runs like the devil) and Cecelia Cheung as Princess Qingcheng manage to give memorable performances.Unfortunately, the over-riding sense here is that we've been here, seen that...and seen it much better in ""House of Flying Daggers"" and ""Hero."" ""The Promise"" is beautiful to look at and a few scenes are genuinely emotional but unfortunately it is also empty, devoid of any kind of magic at its core."
3,This is such a gorgeous movie to watch.,"This is such a gorgeous movie to watch. The special effects, the costumes, the fine and composed movements that each character creates is equally beautiful. If you want a movie to just look at and enjoy without getting overly involved with the plot, then this is a good one to view.The acting is okay, but the version I watched was one that was dubbed with English. It was quite an experience to view a movie with Cantonese people that have a British tongue! Next time I would go with the subtitled version and hear the lovely Cantonese language throughout."
5,Dubbed in English SUCKS!!!!!!,I gave this movie a 5 star rating because of the story and how vibrant the colors are. The thing I absolutely hated about this movie was is it was dubbed in English. If Amazon would of put in the title (Dubbed in English) I wouldn't of paid to watch it. English voice over takes away from the film it self and ruins it. I've read reviews that people say they hate reading sub titles and I think then watch a English movie!!!
5,Great for allergies,Using this product with the Grossan Hydro Puls Nasal and Sinus Irrigation Ssytem has been a god-send. I breathe a lot better now.
4,Nasal Irrigation is the all the Hype Now,"This kit consists of a nose spray bottle, powdered solution and a measuring spoon.Basically it is a nasal irrigation mix, which is then put in the spray bottle. This allows a nice mist to be put up your nose to keep it moist. The package says when traveling this will be very useful, since it is very dry on airplanes.You would think this would feel weird, but it has quite the opposite effect, and it is almost addicting to use.It lost one star, since it is kind of pricey for what ends up to be some mix and a spray bottle."
3,Mediocre.,Very thin piece of tarp. Typical made en Chine product. I would say pay more and get the better stuff. This is so thin that I think I must buy another thing to put on top of it now. Otherwise this is just good for I don't know what. Not really recommended but I am sure you can get worse in this world if you try.
3,What Is Technically Difficult Is Not Always Pleasant To Hear,"Piano enthusiasts might find this set incredible, but I prefer my music to be pleasant. Consider your tastes before buying."
2,not a good fit,"I have a baby jogger city mini double stroller. The protect-a-bub sun coverage would be good, but it is kind of unwieldy and does not fit that well on my stroller model. It might work better for other models."
5,A must-have baby item,"I love this item. Great for long walks to block sun that regular stroller shade isn't big enough for. Very easy to attach and use. This will be especially great for trip to beach. I haven't used the netting part yet, but I imagine it would be useful for keeping a dark environment for baby. I use this on my Kolcraft Contours stroller and my Maclaren XT."
5,Great family tent,"We got this tent on sale for my husband for father's day and it turned out to be a great buy. We loved the cheerful color and the fact that the door of the tent was tall enough for a grown man to enter while standing up. We recommend that you take the time to practice putting it up and taking it down while in the comfort of your own yard. Once you understand the order that the poles are put in, if necessary, it can be put up by only one person in less than 15 minutes.As with most tents, it was almost impossible to get the tent back in the original box once it was taken out, so we now use an old wheeled suitcase to store and transport it. This works better anyway since it is rather heavy for one person to carry. Like most dome tents, the tent can be set up ""free-standing,"" but it works better if pulled taunt by the four stakes in the ground."
4,Great Roomy Family Tent!,"This tent is a great family tent that is roomy and spacious. Very easy to put together, took two people about 10-15 minutes total. Served us well, enough room for the entire family and all of the camping goods that we had. Nice little mat in the front for your shoes, windows are great and give good circulation, and LOVE the mesh roof. Great buy and very reliable, and cheery. It became a bit chilly at night but I dont think the tent could be blamed for that!"
3,Love Baker's Breakfast Cookies-this flavor is OK,"I mean what I say in the title, I always love Baker's Breakfast Cookies. On most work days I have no time for oatmeal, so I eat one of these, an Odwalla or Cliff bar or Fiber One toaster pastries. These cookies fill me up, are healthy, and really keep me satisfied til lunch. However, this flavor is rather bland. I think it just tastes like the regular part of the cookie, no special treat of fruit or chocolate in there. I really don't taste any mocha or cappuccino flavor in it. So I would recommend Baker's but not this flavor. My favorite two are the peanut butter and the cherry chocolate chunk (seasonal)."
2,disappointed,I was very disappointed in the taste of these cookies. They seemed dry and did not taste as yummy as I thought they should.
4,Caffeine!,"I looked at the ingredients of this mocha cappucino breakfast cookie, and saw that it is made with ground espresso. You can taste it as well. Depending on whether you like espresso or not, that's either a good thing or a bad thing. I call these ""caffeine patties"", because they certainly perk me up after eating one. Just keep in mind if you do not like coffee, you probably won't like these very much."
3,good but only if you heat them,"When these arrived, I immediately tried one at room temperature and was disappointed. The next morning I put one in my toaster oven at 325 for 8 minutes and it was actually pretty good.I found the flavors to be a bit weak. Even heated there is no distinct cappuccino flavor.And I like that there's a lot of fiber. That keeps me from eating more than one."
2,Dry and chalky,"I love mocha, cappuccino, coffee, chocolate and everything that I think went into making these cookies - but was dissatisfied with these cookies. They were dry and just a bit chalky - that's the best word I can think of to describe the texture and mouthfeel. If you want to try Erin Baker's breakfast cookies, go for the Chocolate Chunk, Double Chocolate, or Oatmeal Raisin (or the peanut butter minis!)."
4,"My first ""scary"" book","I just found this book that was my favorite book when I was a kid! I read it over and over, and I actually had two copies! I'm buying it now for my kids"
1,didn't work,"I have used foggers and more foggers and more foggers in my battle with fleas. We used these in our basement that has sticky tile/brick flooring. We are having trouble with new eggs hatching, and the regular foggers from the stores weren't cutting it. So I spent a ton of money on these egg killing foggers. Well, they did a good job of killing whatever was alive, but the same day I had more fleas, and weeks later I still have fleas. It didn't get to the eggs. Maybe due to the little cracks in between the tiles. But before I've set off foggers I've bleached and mopped the floor, hoping they'd kill the eggs, and I've fogged 4 times. Nothing has completely worked. We've finally dwindled the flea population to about one or two new arrivals a day. But, maybe more, my poor cats were taken over by them. They could be harboring all the fleas I haven't seen.I'm just disappointed that this product didn't do what it was supposed to do."
5,Painting better landscapes,"I like this book very much because it doesn't repeat the elementary steps of art, or talks about supplies more than necessary. She starts a painting different ways depending on the concept, and she uses warm colors which I like. As I read Ms. Kessler's book, I am learning more about painting. I has beautiful landscapes."
5,Painting Better Landscapes,Great book for me. Thanks for Painting Better Landscapes and thanks for your great service. 100 percent satisfied with everything.
3,Painting Better Landscapes: Spefic Ways to improve your oils,I think the artis talked a little over the average beginning oil painter's head. She talked about what she did but not necessarily why she did it. I did pick up some valuable information and tips.
5,Very helpful for beginners,This book is very well organized and gives a wonderful detailed explanation of how to plan and organize your painting. There are clear sketches to clarify the explanations and even as a more experienced artist it's a helpful guide to recall crucial basic rules to improve your artistic work. In addition the pictures are colourful and attractive. Actually it adds a pleasant and encouraging atmosphere.I deeply recommend it.
5,Painting Better Landscapes,"On my feedback I had entered the feedback for the wrong book, my apologies, please. This book does have a lot of great information and gives details using great techniques."
3,Cute Dainty Earrings,"I bought these for my niece who plays the violin. She loved them. I was surprised how very tiny they are and I do mean tiny (hence 3 stars). However, they are cute."
5,Great earrings,These earrings are very beautiful. I got them for my friend for her birthday and she loved them. They are the perfect size and weight. I would recommend them to anyone.
2,Pads don't work well,"I like the small size of the packets, nice to have in purse, make-up bag, etc., BUT the polish remover does not work well at all. I have to rub and rub and rub, then it still does not remove all the polish. And this was on pale polish! I would hate to think how many pads it would take to remove dark polish! I would NOT purchase this product again."
5,great,This book has a lot of great info in it. I enjoyed reading it and found a lot of it to be new information.
5,"Fascinating, Stunning","This book brings up the issue of a modern subject, and takes it all the way back through the pages of history. It is a stunning account of the history of anorexia as it was once considered to be miraculous fasting: the utter paradox of a living being existing without food. Anorexic girls seem to transcend into a new evolution from symbolizing spiritual exaultment to the modern beauty ideal. A very interesting read, a must read for anyone interested in an in depth look at the disorder, and frankly for anyone with a daughter- to better understand her world and how it came to be."
2,Poultry Science 4th Edition,"This book is out of date in a fast moving industry. For $116, the typeface, paper and binding is extremely cheap. My copy looks like a poor photocopy. My copy is also missing pages 132 and 133. Totally dissatisfied! The publisher should be ashamed of ripping off students with books such as this!"
4,"Compelling, not page tuning","My memories of Ellery Queen are primarily from my childhood in the 70's and the tv series. I looked forward to each episode and therefore wanted to see if I'd enjoy the stories as much in my adulthood. Of course, the weekly episodes were tied up neatly at the conclusion without a lot of subplots. Having said that, I must endorse The Door Between as a an excellently written mystery filled with all the red herrings and twists for which one could hope. However, enjoyable and interesting as it was, it wasn't difficult to put down each night."
2,WAY misleading size...,"This is TINY. Really. The photo on the box shows a four year old with a ball nearly 1/2 her size. In reality, it is about 1/4 her size. I bought this for my 5 year old to replace a hoppy ball that had lasted 15 years in our family but finally died. We blew this up and it's the size of a medium sized ball - smaller than a beachball, larger than a soccer ball. Silly. Will only last my 43"" daughter a short time, and is certainly not as advertised. I am going to have to buy her a different brand instead. DISAPPOINTED."
3,"Lots of fun, but different than what's on box!","We bought this for our 16 month old daughter for Christmas and she loves it. The hopper we received is different than what is pictured on the box and it is clearly smaller in size. The girl on the box looks to be 3 and the ball looks bigger. In reality, the ball is bigger than a basketball, yet smaller than a beach ball. We decided to keep the hopper since it was a good size for our daughter."
4,Small but Fun,"I was shopping for one of these types of hop-along balls for my niece who is 4, and decided this would be the appropriate one because of the Disney princess theme. I had read a previous review that said the ball is quite a bit smaller than they expected, and would only be useful for a young child. I ordered the toy accordingly and it has been a great choice for a 4 year old. I would definitely not order this for a child much older than 6 as it is as mentioned, pretty short (no longer have the ball to post exact measurements). Overall a great toy for a young child!"
2,Small and hard,"My older son has a different kind of bounce ball, so I know how these are supposed to work, and this one just doesn't. It is way smaller than the picture implies, far too small for a four-year old. Also, it is hard as a rock and has almost no give or bounce (and no I didn't fill it with too much air; less air and it would be too small for a kid to even sit on). A terrible ball and a disappointment."
2,Ball Bounce Disney Princess,"I bought 2 units of this product, one of these balls was defective (with a very tiny hole in the holder), when my little girl of 5 years old noticed that, she was so sad and I was so disappointed. The other one was OK."
2,Fell Flat,"I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas so she would have an indoor outlet for her energy. By the afternoon of Christmas day she said it had ""melted"". The ball went flat. She had fun with it before then, but it sure didn't last. She is five years old and the description stated that it was for four year olds and up, and she is not an overweight girl, just a little tall, so I'm not sure what happened."
1,To Small for the child,this item was so small i was ashame to giave it to the child..When it was blown up the child looked at it and walked away..
3,Again,"I wish it was a little bigger than it is, it seems to be smaller than I thought when we blow it up"
5,"Not what I expected, but ok","the ball is a little smaller than I expected it to be, but my 6 year old doesn't seem to care and that's all that matters."
5,Lots of fun.,"My granddaughter LOVED this hopper. The 2 grandkids fought over it and my daughter had to buy another one. It was hard for the 2 1/2 yr. old to learn at first, but, she got the hang of it and loved it! My 6 yr. old granddaughter (the intended giftee) was just the right size for this hopper. It will be great exercise for both of them."
3,small ball,"Bouncing ball is OK and works well. Only issue is size. I should have looked at dimensions more closely but it says years 4 - 15. I incorrectly assumed this was the bouncing ball I remembered at as kid. Well 15"" diameter is almost too small for my older child which is 42 inches tall. So needless to say this is only good for kids up to maybe 6 years old. It is certainly safe given smaller size. For price and a year or so of fun it is probably a good deal."
4,Fun toy,"All three of my children love this toy. My four-year-old is able to use it as designed and hop around on it quite well. My three-year-old is still getting the hang of it. She hasn't quite mastered how to coordinate her body to hop. My one-year-old loves to carry around the ball by the handle. He actually likes it most of all. I do cringe sometimes watching my oldest on it thinking that she is going to get hurt. But, so far she hasn't. The only bad thing is that fresh out of the package, the ball is VERY VERY stinky and also was covered in some kind of oily matter. I just washed it first with warm water and soap and then it was fine."
5,FUN,"Perfect for a 2 year old. I bought this one after reading reviews b/c my 2-yr-old really wanted one, but all the others were too big. This on is perfect for her and her friends!"
4,Color and material,"I bought this toy for my 5 yr old cousin for xmas, now the color in the picture is blue but the actual color of the ball is a lavendar, only the bottom half of the ball is the thick material like a kickball the rest of the ball is just a reagular rubber...when i was younger the whole ball was the thick kick ball material so i'm wondering how long this will last??"
4,Lots of bouncing fun!,"My mom bought one of these for my daughter. It was easy to inflate and my daughter really likes bouncing on it. It took a few tries for her to get the hang of it though. It is a good tool for helping with balance. As far as durability, it seems to be holding up very well. The only problem is that my daughter got bored of it quickly and only bounces on it every once in a while now."
1,Do not buy this item !,"The material used for the ball is too thick therefore the ball barely bounces . It is very easily punctured and not alot of fun , more of a waste of money !"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,This was not worth the price we paid for this toy!!! People...don't be fooled by this..it was so small..my 4 year old grand-daughter cannot fit on it. Money down the drain!
3,wondering?,I would like to see the titles included in this CD as well as others from Nelson Ned. I would like to be able to listen to song samples. I only heard Nelson Ned's songs once and I liked him. Could you facilitate listening to him on line?
2,Mayas not Jaguars,"Misleading information, I bought this for the Jaguar title and picture and it is about Mayan Culture, not about jaguars at all. I am extremely disappointed. The information about mayan culture it is ok."
2,"All fluff, no content","Some nice pictures, but no real information. In 196 minutes, you'd think they could put some real information in there about the Maya ruins, as in their locations, their history, the meanings of the writings, the kings who reigned, etc, but no, just generalities and some pictures, and darned few of those that were very interesting, mostly long blurry transitions with mysterious or pseudo-dramatic music.I'm planning a trip to Central America and I have to say that this thing was no help at all."
2,An inaccurate but entertaining biopic,"A lot of the 'facts' that this mini-series tries to put across are inaccurate, and on a totally unrelated matter, the lead actress looks nothing like her character. As charming as Poppy Montgomery (from TV's ""Without A Trace"") is, she does not remotely resemble Marilyn Monroe. Also, the storytelling in this biopic seems frightfully rushed; and it seems at times that the film-makers were frantically trying to condense Miss Oates' book. However, the cast is very talented, and make a good job of it. Overall, 2/5. The production design is the real stand-out, however, especially the re-staging of the ""Diamond's Are A Girl's Best Friend"" number from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. The song 'Happy Birthday, Mr. President' sang at President Kennedy's birthday part is well done, and (thankfully, rather than making the movie delve into conspiracy theories surrounding Monroe's death) ends the movie."
4,very good acting...but...,"all in all a terrific movie, but i don't feel everything was truthful. one scene has joe dimaggio slapping marilyn across the face, and i'm not buying he ever did that. and also, i think this movie overexagerates on her sex life...i don't think she slept around with as many guys as this movie says...but very compelling and in some scenes poppy montgomery actually does look just like her. but overall the best 'marilyn' movie i've seen and i'm a huge fan of hers, but i felt the movie did a small disservice to her memory with these 'bending the truths' a little, especially since she is no longer alive and can't defend herself. so 4 stars, but def. worth getting a copy."
3,Decent...,"It seems that most die-hard Marilyn Monroe fans dislike this movie because it doesn't tell her true story, and it bends some facts and dates to fit the story. While that's true, you have to remember that this is based on Joyce Carol Oates novel, ""Blonde"", which is a fictional account of Marilyn Monroe's life. The novel and the movie are both intended as works of fiction and shouldn't be read as a biography of her life and work. If that's what you're looking for, then pick up a biography (you have plenty to choose from). Otherwise, this is a decent, entertaining movie. Personally, I prefer the novel, but I'm a pretty big fan of Joyce Carol Oates."
5,Jensen Ackles!,"I bought this movie for one reason- Jensen Ackles! He and Patrick Dempsey were in a three-way with Poppy Montgomery, so that's why I gave it five stars!"
1,nothing to learn about Marilyn in this movie,This is based on a fictional book about MM so I tried to pretend it was someone else. I didn't do a very good job of it and so I thought it was awful. Poppy Montgomery is not a very good actress and this is not a good story.
1,VERY BAD PRODUCT DO NOT BUY,"THE COMPANY THAT SELLS THIS PRODUCT USUALLY SELL GOOD PRODUCTS, NOT THIS ONE. THIS IS THE WORST SQIUEGGIE ON THE MARKET. IT DOESNT FIT A TIPPMANN 98 CUSTOM, A5, OR CUSTOM PRO. AS A MATTER OF FACT THE PRODUCT BROKE AFTER ONE TRY TO FIT THROUGH THE BARREL. THIS SQUEGGIE IS SUUUUUUCH BAD QUALITY, IM SERIOUS, I WOULD NOT EVEN ACCEPT THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE. THIS IS THE SUCKIEST SQUEEGIE, AN OVER PRICED PIECE OF SQUEGGIE. DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY"
1,DO NOT BUY,"Does not fit any barrel! After a lot of cutting I managed to use it, but it scratched my barrel in the prosses :("
4,An enjoyable and fast read.,"The characters were very believable for that time period. The lovers' story was well developed and their love scenes well written. A really enjoyable and fast read. I had not read Elizabeth Elliott before, but look forward to reading other books by her."
2,The hero was insufferable :-(,"I saw no reason for the heroine to fall in love with a hero that showed that much contempt and lack of feeling. Whenever she did anything worthy, he usually became angry and locked her away. I thought the author left her hero without enough human/humane feeling in her quest to show him as an abused man trying to shut off his softer side. Short of not being beaten, I didn't feel like the heroine got a much better than deal than with the villain."
2,Different People Like Different Things,"This book was actually well written, but it falls falls short because of the emotional abuse and brutality. There are some people who do not mind this, because it is a medieval romance novel. I try to take the time setting into account, but I just cannot deal with a story where the heroine is punished by being locked away for over two weeks because she angers the hero. I also cannot deal with a jerk of a hero who considers himself the lord and master of everything. He gets angry and punishes the heroine for dealing with a crooked steward(I think it was the steward) without asking permission, locks her in a solar for a time later on in the book, and pretty much treats her like a marionette with him jerking the strings any way he pleases. I guess I am just one of those ""sensitive"" readers. Oh well, if any one else considers themselves in this class, you will not like this book and shouldn't waste their money."
5,"A ""Must Have"" for your child's book collection","This is a beautiful book with a great story. I always favor giving books as gifts to young children and seek out ""the classics."" This one fits the bill!"
5,Great memories of this story,"A group of retired men at our community made wood tug boats for needy children for Christmas. I felt that today's children, especially in the mid-west would have no knowledge of tug boats and what they do/did. I loved this story when I was a child! The books I ordered from individual sources were all in excellent condition and a great price. The shipping costs were too high. Wish I had read your shipping information before I ordered these. Why don't you carry this book in your collection?"
4,"Poems are great, reading is great, but","the producers could have, should have, included more. Julie Harris' reading is excellent, and of course the poems are excellent, but there's empty space on the disk and there's an ad on the disk for audio-disk recordings that is not what I paid for and not what belongs with Dickinson's poetry. And, as long as I'm being picky, ""essential"" Dickinson does not include the significant proportion of letters on this disk at the expense of quite a few better-known poems. So it gets only 4 stars from me. ""Publication is the Auction / Of the Mind"" for sure."
3,Big Five still going strong,"As long as human beings interact, people try to explain behavior. By knowing about ones motives, we might be able to interact more succesfull with each others. Behavior can be explained in terms of personality traits and there are few theories that are competing. One of these is the Big Five (McCrae & Costa, 1987). Since the first publications of the theory it has inspired many psychologist all over the world. The theory can fully compete with Jung's, Eysenck's, Catell's, Spearmans, Thurstone's and Guilford's theory of personality traits. Due to the fact that Costa was able to reduce the traits to an acceptable number, still covering personality this theory will survive and is interesting and helpfull to many people prof's as well as non professional psychologists. The book is as helpfull as the theory it self and is worth reading for all those people interested in personality. Many psychologist will say a must."
3,Not the best Hardy,Eh. I re-read this for my book group. Wish we had chosen Tess... Not much happens but it takes a while.
4,Far From the Madding Crowd by Thomas Hardy,I have been catching up on books I missed when I was younger and Thomas Hardy's Far from the Madding Crowd was a book I thoroughly enjoyd. It is a Classic.
3,"okay, not going to finish","I was told I should try some Thomas Hardy! This book felt kind of drama-heavy for me, very Heathcliff and Catherine (C or K?)... which is good, I'm sure, just not for me. (I didn't finish Wuthering Heights, either.)"
4,Catch up,"Read this book because It was not one that I read at school. Hard to put down after the first few chapters kept me enthralled to the end, sad in places."
4,One of my favorites of all time,"Was slightly disappointed that they didn't do any sort of behind the scenes documentary on the DVD because there were a lot of great special effects in this movie, but otherwise, was glad to see one of my all time faves in DVD.And heck, they drink Tab!... :-) That's worth 1/2 star right there."
4,hello joshua,"Brodericks only really wonderful film. This film seems somewhat dated but I suppose that's the point. I love the excitement of the film, the mystery of the new world of computers and nuclear war. The story is brilliantly unique and engaging and I love getting involved with the action.The dvd gives a chance to see this movie as it should be seen with clarity and perfection. DVD brings war games to the 21st century it should be in your collection, if it isn't then don't hesitate, I recommend it greatly!"
3,ENTERTAINING ALBEIT SILLY,"Video game remake of the 1964 classic ""Fail Safe"" is in its own right thrilling at times. Matthew Broderick shines as the naive boyfriend who would rather cheat than do it right (although he'd probably be better at the latter). Thinking he has found a new list of games, he takes on NORAD and wins (or does he?). Most of the adults in this story are morons - which rings rather odd considering this film was made by adults. Like ""Back to the Future"", it's full of funny little jokes you'll probably miss the first time through."
5,War Games,"Iwas just studying my career when I saw this movie... I was amazed by the resources had a young kid at his grasp. I still had to punch holes in a card at that moment!!!Anyway, the story is great, the thrill is superb and this movie is in my collection just for that... Excuse my english. I hope you understand what I mean..."
4,It could have happened,"War Games with Matthew Broderick. Interesting to see what computers & floppys looked like when this picture was filmed. The real Brainiac, if properly programmed, might just as easily started the countdown."
4,quality movie,Classic movie depicting what happens when we rely too much on technology and not enough on human ideals and rational
1,Spanish subtitles don't work,"There is an error in this DVD, and other folks here have also spotted it. The advertised Spanish subtitles do not work. French comes out instead. When you select English, the words are in English. When you select French, the words are in French. And when you select Spanish, the words are again in French.I had bought this DVD specifically for its Spanish subtitles since I have family that doesn't understand English very well. Que pena."
4,"Let's play ""Globel Thermonuclear War""","I watched this movie looking for obvious mistakes. With my limited knowledge couldn't find any (yet I'm sure there was a few). For the average person like myself, it's a good flick.I wonder if that's true at that time that 22% of the military personal wouldn't obey commands to launch nuclear missiles. If so, what happened September 26, 1983 is even more remarkable (Google that date).Very good movie in my opinion."
4,No spanish!,"Of course, WarGames is great entertainment, and the feature comentary is worth buying the DVD. But for them who wants to have the subtitles in spanish, I do not have them on my DVD. It is in the language option, but on the spanish channel I have french. Dont know is it only because I use it with my Mac Computer."
4,What's a modem?,"Fun watching this 20 years later and explaining to my young teens why Matthew Broderick's character takes this huge, corded phone receiver and docks it to get ""online""...also the old DOS language and computer-generated voice (DO-YOU-WANT-TO-PLAY-A-GAME?) were fun. Surprisingly, the storyline riveted my 13 & 14 year-olds despite the antiquated technology. The whole teenager who is doing something silly and funny (tickets to Paris? OK!) and getting in over his head (and it was Ferris Bueller, after all, every kid's hero) resonated with them."
3,So-So Blu-Ray Transfer,"This review is for the blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself. While the blu-ray version of War Games is slightly more detailed than the upconverted DVD, it has a significant amount of film grain. When I compared the two, there is not much of a difference. If you already own the 25th anniversary edition DVD, I would not recommend upgrading to blu-ray."
3,"Great movie, disappointing DVD","I have enjoyed this movie since in came out in the '80's, however, this DVD was lacking. There were very few special features for a 25th anniversary release. The picture, while this is still a regular DVD (and this movie was unavailable on Blu-Ray), was awful by comparison to other regular DVDs, even on the Blu-Ray player, which upconverts the picture to a better quailty. Disappointing DVD."
4,"A hacker classic, entertaining","Yes it's dated, yes it's far-fetched. But it's probably the best commercial hacker movie ever made. Broderick is convincing as the computer whiz about to start armageddon. Computer buffs like myself can't help but appreciate this film's relatively fair treatment of the subject but at the same time, true campiness. It'll never be considered a ""great film"", but it's a must-see for the techno-savvy and those who remember home computers and have a sense of nostalgia. Also recommended, if you like this... Sneakers. END"
5,One of my 80s favorites,"Love this film, finally realized my kids were old enough to enjoy it with us for familynight. Forgot there was a bit of bad language but since it is mostly extremely angry and frustrated military types I was able to frame that as very normal in the military as they are under so much pressure. So if you are very concerned about exposing your children to that you should TiVo it when those words will be edited out. The rest of the movie is still just plain great entertainment. Interesting history lesson for kids too about the Cold War. Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy charming and cheeky....wish they still made more movies like this that appeal across generations. Also a good history lesson about how rebellious this character was to be connecting a telephone to his computer to GET IT TALK TO ANOTHER COMPUTER - shock horror!!"
4,Much better,"The last time I watched this was early 80's. Until now I had always remembered it as a teen adventure movie. After watching it again now, there is a lot more movie here. Aside from the obvious tech time warp, it holds up pretty good"
5,Good Clean fun,"I love this movie. Get in the Way back Machine and have fun! The computers are near antiques, but the methods would still work today, almost. Mathew Broderick's talent shines, even as a teenager. And when was the last time you could watch a movie with your kids and not be embarrassed? Great family movie, especially those with under 13."
5,War games a real treat,The DVD is a real treat. I especially enjoyed under special features the commentary during the movie. It brought to light much of the thinking of the director and others. I knew the movie very well from VHS but the DVD allowed me to enjoy the movie experience even more.
3,Speech in DD 5.1 sounded hollow,"While I obviously like ""WarGames"" (wouldn't have watched it on DVD if I didn't), the DD 5.1 ""upgrade"" made many of the actors' voices sound hollow. However, the FX sounds, particularly during the final sequences, sounded much better than the original. I don't plan on purchasing the DVD version, but I might rent it again."
4,Delightful revisiting of Enjoyable Film,"The extra features add to the enjoyment of a well done film. Young, at the time stars, Broderick and Sheedy tell of this an early film in their careers. Director's and technical comments reveal how innovative and revolutionary this film was. Story of the plot's research and development process is fascinating. Shared this film with spouse and friend and we enjoyed the look back and the well told story again."
5,Great Movie - Great Service,"The DVD was in great shape - nearly new looking - and has worked very well for us. This was a good purchase, again!"
3,"OR, get it cheaper EVERYWHERE else!","You can play the Amazon pricing games here, and get it for $13, OR, you can get it for $10 at Best Buy, or even LESS at Deepdiscount. AND, FREE SHIPPING. When will Amazon learn. I know, I know, you HAVE to milk as much revenue out of people who don't know how to shop as possible. It's the Retail Motto, take advantage of those who don't know. Why get ripped off??? STOP PLAYING THE GAMES! As for the movie, it's a classic. Lots of fun and nostalgia, get it, just get it where it's being offered for a reasonable price. Oh, don't worry, the price here will go up and down up and down over the next few weeks. It's the retail way. Funny though, the cost of it to the sellers doesn't change. GO FIGURE!"
2,". . .Yeah, right . . .","This film came out just in time to exploit the world's fear of hackers. To the computer literate, it is about as believable as the average slasher flick -- unfortunately, there weren't many folks who knew any better in the mid 1980's. In fact, a Federal judge based his personal opinions regarding computers, modems, BBSes and the people who would own such devices on his having seen this movie.It was entertaining, but check your brain at the door."
2,25 years later...,"This movie is about a British operative named only ""Joshua"" who communicates with a high school student and his girlfriend over the internet. Security is compromised and Joshua forces the young couple into a deadly game of chess creating a lot of confusion for American military brass. The Soviet Union was somehow involved too but indirectly. This is where the movie lost me, hence the 2 stars."
4,All your base are belong to us,"Good movie. I would also recommend Failsafe if you are into the genre of ""what if nuclear science blew up in our face?"""
5,The Cold War was a scary time.,"Buried deep within a mountain in Colorado is NORAD. Brave men and women who watch radar screens, ready at a second's notice to alert the US Armed Forces to missile attack. Matthew Broderick plays a boy genius who unknowlingly taps into NORAD's computer system thinking that it's the computer system of a sophisticated toy company. He unknowingly awakens a computer program that tries to trick NORAD into firing it's missiles on Russia. After watching this movie, and drinking in all it's reprecussions, you may think twice the next time you turn on your home computer."
4,good,rented to let 14 year old boy watch what happens when you become obssessed with hacking into systems. He now knows why I get mad when he tells me some of the things he does.
3,Oddly enough Hollywood still can't write about computers...,"When I was 12 I thought computers really could hack into NORAD and start a necular war. Sadly, age and cynicisim have destroyed that notion. However, still a decent movie if you can look past the silly technology babble they use."
5,Great movie,"Love it on Blu-Ray, and seeing it again in that format on a large screen brings all those enjoyment monents back from the first time I watched it on a VHS."
2,Another Great French Novel Mangled by a Bad Translation,"I am a native French speaker and a professor of French Literature. I love this novel and have a real bone to pick with this 1932 British translation, which refers to the hero-revolutionaries as ""terrorists,"" a word which has come to mean something quite horrendous in America. Malraux's writing style is anything but stiff. It's the translator who chose stiff and stuffy words. Where there seems to be a tone of condescention from the translator, there is none whatsoever in the French. If anything, this is a very fluid novel, based on what Malraux considered an American style of novel writing. Fluid, fast-paced, character-driven. Why is this the only translation available to us in the US? Because the publisher probably didn't have to pay a copywright fee to publish this translation. It's a sin of greed -- how ironic when this novel is basically about that very thing."
2,they sent me the worng one for my car- be careful,They sent me the wrong one. A standard one and I have a Grand. I threw away the box thinking there would be no error on Amazons part. So I have not returned it.
5,Quick & Healthy II,This cookbook is just what it claims to be and the menu suggestions are a great help in providing a complete meal. I have tried recipes from each category and feel confident that ingredients and cooking times are accurate. Flavor is never sacrificed even when being conscious of dietary needs. Servings are just right for couple or provides leftovers for single person. I'm buying it for friends!
5,Excellent Healthy Cookbook,I have about 12 lowfat cookbooks in my collection. This cookbook and volume 1 in the series are my favorites because the recipies taste great and they are very easy to make. You will love this cookbook!
5,The best cookbook to own,"This is the most used cookbook in my house. It features simple to find and use ingredients and all recipes are quick and tasty, not to mention quite healthy. I have given this book out as gifts to two others already and they both have given it similar reviews."
3,"Okay, but not exactly what I was looking for","My objective was simple-fast, small amount of common ingredients, appealing meal ideas.This book called for some strange ingredients, some of the recipes looked tedious, and I really just wasn't very attracted to any of the meal ideas in here. Not the type of food I am going to be able to get husband to eat either, so I wound up sending it back.I have had great success so far with a few other books:Diabetic Low-Fat & No Fat Meals in MinutesThe Busy People Series of cookbooks."
3,"Convenient, but most recipes aren't fantastic","We find the weekly meal plan, complete with grocery list, very convenient. However, we've only been really pleased with 1 or 2 recipes out of the 15 or so we've tried. Many of the recipes are bland, while others are bad enough that we'll never make them again."
3,Its okay,This book I guess is good for a single person or a family who needs to cut back on salt. If you like your food very flavorful don't get this book. On the other hand if your dieting it is a pretty good book.
3,"good, but obviously heavily improvised","this album is good, and worth the [price]i bought it for... but, a lot of the songs have a very very strong indication that they are just jam sessions, with the lyrics repeating over and over, even when they're fairly mediocre, and it seems to be obvious that the reason they are being repeated over and over, is because he cant think of anything else to say. this is a good album, but is far from comparable to other james material, and if you're looking for a real ""album"", this is not it. this is more of a smattering of improvised meanderings, coupled with some strong material. not their best work, i think."
3,Cleans dirty shoes well,It cleans dirty shoes well but I don't think it's going to stand up to the test of time outdoors. It's already developed a rip on the underside black backing after only a couple of months in use. It gets very hot for bare feet when in the sun.
2,Disappointed,"Did not lay completely flat........and after the first snow, a light shaking to remove the snow caused the backing to crack.Not the same quality as the old astroturf products. Not suitable for cold climates for sure."
3,Not (update) worth every penny,"I don't know how long they will hold up, but I would be willing to replace them every two years considering how effectively they scrape off the mud and snow.Update: I had to ding this down to three stars because the one in my garage is coming apart after a short period of use. I think I might can re-glue the ""turf"" back to the undermat, but I shouldn't have to do so."
3,Wrong color,The photo on Amazon clearly shows a green doormat. The doormat that was delivered is an icky grayish brown color.
1,Platter/Plate Hanger,"The hanger was supposed to hang a platter up to 30 inches. My 25 inch platter was hung as soon as the hanger arrived. Shortly after, the hanger stretched out and my beautiful platter fell and broke. When the platter fell, it also broke a bowl sitting under it that I had brought home from Spain. Beware, this hanger can hold only the lightest of plates!"
3,"Good, but it needs stronger springs for heavier items","I bought this hanger to support a brass wall plate measuring roughly 30 inches across. It fit the item well, but upon raising it off the floor the springs were far to giving to hold the hanger together. I ended up using the brackets, but abandoning the springs and replacing them with 8-inch bungee straps which were much stronger and hung my platter with ease. The platter weighs about 7 lbs, so I don't fault the hanger, but I had to figure out a way to make it work!"
1,DOES NOT WORK,"This item does not work. I purchased it to hang a platter that is 19.5"" in diameter and while the hanger did fit when I tried to hang it all it would do is stretch out. My recommendation is to only use it for 30"" (and possibly larger) platters. Very dissapointing!"
2,Lasted for only a couple weeks,"I got this and new that it could be a little loose since my plate was 16"". I used it and after only a couple of weeks I heard a big crash in my dining room. The plate and the hanger were both laying on the ground."
5,The best of the bunch,I spend an hour every day in a pool doing aqua exercise and get a much better workout with a flotation belt. I have tried a wide variety of different kinds of belts - from cheap (half the price of this one) to expensive (twice the price of this one) and not one comes close to this one.It's the only one that is comfortable. I am a 220 pound woman and find the medium size perfect. The strap that holds it on is made of some kind of stretchy stuff that makes all the difference in keeping it in place and comfortable. The belt itself is the perfect shape for doing the job comfortably.
2,Okay,"When I got it, the top ball was a different color than the rest of the ring and had glitter in it. Defeats the purpose of being clear."
2,Not fantastic,"I found these boots to be kind of narrow in the shaft and in the foot. They weren't as comfortable as I need my boots to be if I am expecting to wear them often in the fall and winter, so I am returning them."
1,Nowhere near as good as her other books,"I was terribly disappointed with Julia Child and Company and its sequel, Julia Child and More Company. The recipes I tried were okay, but nothing special -- unlike the two-volume Art of French Cooking, or Julia Child's Kitchen, where every single recipe is a masterpiece. For example, the pasta was very flat and nowhere near as good as other recipes I've tried. I gave my copies to a charity garage sale."
3,OK book,"I bought this for help with my 6.5-year-old since he finally has homework and has been giving us a hard time. Its written for an older child to use as a guide, so wasn't all that helpful at this stage. Maybe in a few years it will be, dunno."
2,Not as funny as we had hoped,"Cute idea and had some points that made sense, but not substantial enough to make it worth the purchase price. My daughter, a voracious reader, read it that afternoon and promptly forgot about it. I also read through it and found it to be ""light"". If you have a child that really has serious issues even touching their homework - this may help to start a conversation, but it isn't the answer to the problem."
5,Well done!,The kids that got this book say that they can follow the thoughts in it and laugh while doing it. Some good practical ideas.
5,Great Read!,"My daughter really enjoyed this book, I believe it will help her with getting her homework done. She laughed the whole way through the book!"
5,so funny,"Okay, I wasn't sure my middle school kids/teens would read this - they loved it! It was so funny, gave us all a new perspective on homework. Just a fun book, a good conversation starter about homework and getting it done! Love it!"
2,Very disappointing after the first two volumes,"I loved the first two volumes of Wodehouse Playhouse, but the third is quite disappointing. To begin with, the wonderful Pauline Collins is missing, and the chemistry between her and John Alderton was priceless. Alas, no actress here comes up to Ms. Collins' zany delivery, and the results are flat. The writing has lost its edge as well, and even the timing seems off. Only ""Mulliner's Buck-U-Uppo"" comes near attaining the hilarious heights of the first two seasons. Completists will find it a necessity, but casual viewers should stick to the first two volumes."
2,Without Pauline Collins pass on Wodehouse Playhouse,"I would not have bought this DVD if I had known that it was the sans Collins version. First I am a great fan of Wodehouse done well. The PBS Jeeves and Wooster was beautifully done. Playhouse 1 and 2 was in the main beautifully done. Just 2 or 3 weak stories. The Wodehouse series, when played by regular actors, has in essence, some rather dumb scenes and stupid stories. It is the talent of Collins and Alderton that brings a new dimension and makes it so enjoyable. Collins sense of the ridiculous, is superb and quite unique. She has some of the most terrible lines and somehow makes them unforgettable. She:""Pah!"", He:""Did you say 'Pah'?"", She: ""Yes I said Pah. Pah! Pah! Pah!"" What can any other actress do with lines like that. Alderton is excellent but Wodehouse is possible without Alderton. Without Collins these stories are not worth much."
1,I do not recommend this model,"In general I prefer electric trimmers to gas ones. I don't mind the cord, and they are cleaner and quieter than other styles. I'm looking for a new trimmer - different brand. I used a Weed-Eater brand trimmer for years, and was very happy with it. After losing that one, I bought this one... mistake...I have used this one for about a year - moderate use in a small suburban Texas yard. It worked well with the original spool. I have fought with the spool & string repeatedly since then. When it is time for a change, the entire mechanism gets stuck together to the point of being unworkable -- will not budge. Screwwdrivers and channel-locks only scrape up the spool worse. The long plastic bar broke in half yesterday when I tapped it on the ground to let out some more line - really cheap construction. Will never buy Toro again."
1,Want to waste 20 to 30 minutes per lawn cut? Then buy Toro!,"It's incredible the amount of time I waste manually feeding out the string on this trimmer because the spool becomes essentially frozen. Factor in 20 to 30 minutes per lawn cut wasted just manually feeding out the string. Then there is the string guide, which is a separate item from the spool head and so falls out. Mine is lost. That makes the spool even more disfunctional. Toro should be ashamed to put this product on the market."
1,spool is frozen,"It's simple enough for a string trimmer - until you have to get the spool out. Then just throw it in the garbage and buy a new one, because the whole mechanism is frozen. I've only used it three times. Buy another brand, you might have better luck."
1,Same Experience As The Others,"Spool jammed, and a slightly brisker tap to dislodge it shattered the cheap, plastic shaft. The spool wouldn't dislodge even with a screwdriver. Garbage."
1,Awful,This is based on the fact that I did not get what I ordered from Brands on Sale. It was a size smaller and came with no mask. AND I am still airing for a refund. Can't believe this company is allowed to sell on Amazon!!! Deplorable!
4,"""Illegal Operation: Tell-all Book Released""","I picked up this book after hearing about it on the radio, and I'm glad I did. Being a heavy computer user, I have heard about some of the stories detailed in this book, but most of them just made my jaw drop as to how modern technology can screw up either by itself or by a human hitting the wrong button. So this book is highly recommended, but don't give it to any of your luddite friends. They'll use it to prove you right."
2,All the stories are basically the same,"This book contains dozens of short stories about mistakes that businesses supposedly made (some of which are urban legends). Many of the stories are the same thing over and over again. How many different ways are there for companies to screw up account balances? At least ten, if you believe this book. One example would have been enough--the other nine were just repeats.Another thing that annoyed me was that the author does not know the proper meaning of the word ""ironic.""It gets a second star from me because a few of the stories are interesting and entertaining."
5,Great product,"My son uses this in his swimming classes so we bought one for the house too. Works great, he practices swimming with it and we keep it in a shaded place so it doesn't get ruined."
3,A good book; needs to be read in context of the series.,"This book, being the fifth in a series of seven, has the unlucky duty of acting as a ""bridge"". As such, it starts a little slow and never quite gets up to speed. The book also comes on the heels of a tough act to follow, Serpent Mage, volume four in the series, which is an outstanding book. Although much of 'The Hand of Chaos' is made up of ""filler"" material, there are some redeeming qualities. Hugh the Hand's character is revisited and developed, which in my opinion makes the book. Haplo's low-profile in the book, as well as the absence of Alfred the Sartan, leave the burden on Hugh. 'The Hand of Chaos' is a good book but it does not quite match up to the level of first four books in the series."
3,Death Gate - Fantasy for the masses,"I must say that reading Death Gate is a really pleasant experience, even though i would like to categorize the series as 'fantasy bouquet novels' (dunno if you american folks have bouquet, but hey, you know what i mean, right) Apart from that: it's only suitable the fantasy-minded! Beware the last book, by the way: it isn't all that..."
3,I laughed too when I saw how little $5 buys you,"Seriously, it's not as much as a McDonald's ketchup packet.And then I got p***-off when I realized that the tiny envelope can't be sealed up, so I had to tape it back into the original blister pack so it wouldn't leak all over my tool box. For five bucks a resealable cap would be real nice."
5,"Bear ...big hit in our house, even if it's not blue","When this CD from our collecting came up missing, WE HAD TO REPLACE IT. We have been fans of Bear in the Big blue house for years! Our oldest outgrew the CD so we hung on to it in case we had more children. 10 years later, we finally did. My little one goes to bed with it on. IT HAS ALL THE SONGS WE have grown to love and adore Bear for singing. It may an oldie, but it's still a goodie."
5,A BEARY GOOD INVESTMENT!,"I love this cd. I have to have this in my car when going out with my son. He is 20 months old now but we have been listening to Bear for about 1 yr now. I was so excited to get this cd (how we change when we have kids!) The songs are catchy and familiar and i must admit i do sing along! any bear fan & their parents would be happy with this cd. Buy it, you will be glad!"
5,Bear and the Gang: my son's best friends and mine!,"I don't know what I'd do without Bear and the Gang. This CD is absolutely wonderful. My 20 month old son lights up AND calms down as soon as I put the CD on in the car. He loves ALL of the songs. His favorite being ""What's that Smell"". He actually sniffs along with Bear throughout the entire song. A close second would be ""The Bear Cha-Cha-Cha"". He does a little dance in his car seat for that one. I definitely recommend this CD to anyone with toddlers!"
1,Piece of junk,"I purchased from Discount Jungle as a xmas gift for my wife.I was most concerned with playing mp3's from a DVD.It does play Mp3's from a DVD but you can not read any of theinfo ( folder, track etc.) on the screen.It seems that boss wasn't smart enough to use different softwarefor this unit than for the big screen.So it is imposable regardless of how close you get to make outany of the letters on the screen.For my wife and I it is a useless piece of junk that Discount Junglewill not return so be forewarned.It is useless."
4,Fantastic CD!,"Nenhum de nos is the most famous rock band of south Brazil. Their music is like slow rock,but it's fantastic. The most famous musics of them are ""O astronauta de marmore"" and ""Camila,camila""."
2,disappointed,This is the 2nd inverter(returned 1st one for same reason). Supposed to put out 110 to 120 volts but output is only 90 volts with 13 volt imput and no load. This time I ordered a Xantrex pure sine wave inverter.
3,too politically enhanced,"After reading this work of literature, I was unhappy with such a biography that spent to much time discussing the politcal happening instead of giving insightful looks at the true character of Eva Peron. I enjoy the fascinating statistics of her life, but the author did not add much insight to it's greatness, as Evita rose from poverty to conquer the people, especially the poor, of Argentina. Too much politics!"
4,Evita's life was frightening and fascinating!,"I have been curious about Eva Peron for yearsnow, and after finally reading this book Ihave ""slaked my thirst for the knowledge ofthis woman's good deeds,"" like schoolchildrenin Argentina at the time of her death.Eva's life was hard, but what she made of itis simply incredible to read. She is to mesomeone to be both criticized for her over-zealous methods and praised for her undyingefforts to help her people. This book openedmy eyes to her life in a way Lloyd Webbernever can. It's also a less-daunting readthan tackling Eva's own rhetoric and Spanishin ""La Razon de mi Vida."""
4,"evita, First lady;Abio of Evita Peron","This book is very good, Very political, but then you can't expect anything diffrent.A good insight to a very conteversial person.Saint or sinner. A bit of both.Its a shame she died so young, but did it save her from the fall from grace, that would have come along.!!!!!!!!"
2,Myopic View,"I've been trying to put together a sort of a big picture view of the Perons, starting pretty much from scratch. This book offers a handful of useful insights but is clearly slanted and does not jibe with much of what I come up which is believable.Getting any sort of a real read on the Perons is difficult and is not helped by the fact that most English language sources are filtered through several kinds of nearly impenetrable culture bias which are all irrelevant to the circumstances with which the Peron's had to deal.As nearly as I can tell, they inherited a country which was economically advanced while politically primitive, and came within a half dozen ideas and three doses of HPV vaccine or one timely cancer operation of turning it into a model for the world. I am to the right of center for an American and find myself being forced to like the Perons."
1,irresponsible,"This biography is particularly deceiving as Mr. Barnes packages it wrapped in historical information, but then includes misinformation and gossip presenting it all as facts."
1,"cheap, flimsy","I would like to see Derek Jeter try and hit off this pitiful tee. Very cheaply made, and very flimsy. No way anyone over 10 years old could use this tee. Very disappointed."
1,Frail,I just got this tee today. I took my kids to the park. After 12 hits from my 8 year old daughter and 5 from my 5 year old son it snapped. The plastic piece the two screws on the side go into snapped. There was one mishit from my 5 year old. Very disappointing and I will be buying a different brand today.
5,Radio Days,Excellent work from a traditional Southern Gospel Quartet. The death of lead singer Glen Payne makes this a keepsake for years to come.
3,WWI Propaganda 13 years too late,"This a film hard to classify, Imagine Van Johnson, the All American boy as a German Army Officer in WWII! The story could have been great since all the Germans were to masquerade as American soldiers in what we called the Battle of the Bulge. Oberst Otto Skorzeny SS is featured briefly in German Army uniform!The Germans with the exception of Van Johnson are shown as either arrogant and offensive or basically stupid.There is one scene where the Germans kill Americans who have surrendered.The plot is something a high school sophomore probably wrote.The end is not really a surprise but is illogical.I saw this film in 1958 when it first was released. I bought a copy of it over 30 years ago.BTW, this B&W; film was in widescreen.That being said, I do recommend this film for what might have been!"
4,Smooth Reggae and R&B,"This CD is a must have if you like a touch of R&B in your Reggae. ""Touch and Play"" Is a definent belle of this ball. And when Reign collaborates with the lovely Amel Leruille (Sp?),the former lead vocals for Groove Theroy, together they make gold! With these great beats and soft rhythems, Indestructible is a magnificent treat."
4,Camco white vinyl trim insert for RVs,"It worked: it makes the RV look good: it could be just a little bit wider, however, and might not stay well in another brand of the metal strip that holds it"
3,rv trim,"Much lighter weight then stock trim.Easy to install, well worth the price and should last long enough."
4,rv trim,"Good product and easy to install, however does not fit well on trim around side door curves. bunches up in corners and does not conform to corners to look as original product. Great for long straight runs."
3,Example Warning,"Yes there are lots of good tips in this book, but no one has mentioned yet one important fact about this book: The author is the publisher of a SEX zine, and many of his examples and pointers are specific/relevant to sex zines...this book may not be a suitable choice for young readers! In addition to the many references to sex zines throughout the content, there is an entire chapter for ""Sex Zines and Queer Zines"", and this fact needs to be mentioned so that adults of young children who wish to start a zine can consider this fact when deciding to buy this book."
4,Better than History..,"This is a collection of articles written by James D. Davis for the Memphis Appeal in the mid to late 1870s. There is the color here of the earliest days of Memphis without that boring sort of ""resorting to accuracy"" that belabors more ""historical"" documents. The book is a pure joy for someone wanting to know about the very earliest part of the history of Memphis (about 1826 to 1850).For all of his ""literary license"" Davis tells tales not told elsewhere. Parts of this book may be found on the MemphisHistory web site for preview."
4,The 13 episdodes are:,"""The Real Temple of Doom""""America's Pyramids""""Stonehenge Secrets Revealed""""The Vikings: Voyage to America""""Roanoke: The Lost Colony""""Cleopatra: The Last Pharaoh""""City of the Gods""""The Real Queen of Sheba""""Troy: Of Gods and Warriors""""The Da Vinci Code: Bloodlines""""Giants of Patagonia""""The Real Sin City: Sodom And Gomorrah""""Lost Cities of the Amazon.""All about 47 minutes long"
4,Excellent Series and Host,"Bernstein is great as the host of Digging for the Truth. He shows enthusiasm and is able to make what may seem mundane interesting. While the 2nd season was not quite as good, the series is reminiscent of the old In Search Of... series with Leonard Nimoy. I can heartily recommend these DVD's for those interested in archeology, sociology, or history."
2,Just get make yourself,"Incubus is a great band, they're #4 on my 30 best bands list, but if you want an Incubus CD, don't get this one. Get ""Make Yourself"". Or maybe one of their other 2 but this is probably their worst album. Its only got 6 tracks from their older CDs and turned em into live and acuostic songs. I would not say thats a good album to get. I do recommend the other Incubus CDs however. But this is not one to buy."
4,Incubus Defianitly Attacks!!!,Incubus does it again with an awesome EP. This CD is great for people that like the new CD Make yourself. The acoustic version of the song Pardon Me is mellow but well done. You gotta like at least one of the songs!
4,Only for the Hidden Track,"Ok I didnt even understand this cd at first. But I think its worth getting for the hidden track alone. It's titled ""Smoking the Herb Again"", many ppl think it's not even Incubus singing the song, and it doesnt help that they deny it. But they also make up a million differant stories about Chuck. But alas it is Incubus singing the song (hi Jose and Kilmores voices are very distinct). I love Live Versions of ANY song. And Crowded Elevators is an ok song I guess. I think that only hard-core incubus fans should get this cd. If you are just starting out, start with Make Yourself."
5,incubus always puts out great cds and this is no different..,this cd is a great cd if you like incubus and if you dont like incubus this cd will get you hooked on incubus forever and you will have to buy all of their cds this cd great it has alot of great acoustic songs that you can get on one cd rather than buying a bunch of their imports to get the songs you want it has great live songs too and if you have read to the end of my review here you have waited to long to buy the cd enjoy incubus and grab yourself a copy now!!!!!!!!
5,This is a great cd!,"When Incubus Attacks Vol. 1 rocks! I love the new versions of the great songs and I also love the live version of ""Pardon Me"". The Hidden track on this album is, well, different. Buy it though, it is going to be rare!"
4,Not The Best but Great otherwise,"This cd was great it had all of incubus's best hits and they made them either acoustic or ""mixed them"".Pardon me is the best song ever! it's acoustic version is great. incubus did a great job converting it and not losing any of it's emotion packed energy.Stellar this song was even better acoustic you wouldn't think there would be any way to make it better but incubus as always went above and beyond to make the work as perfect as possible and they succeeded!!Crowded elevator is a good song not their best but even incubus's average songs are great. it's not my favorite but nonetheless i play it anyway.favorite things is a great rocking tune that shows that incubus has many faces but it's the same brandon boyd writing the lyrics!If you really want to see incubus at their best buy this and the make yourself album (their best ever...!)"
5,Incubus Rules,"This CD kicks. ""Crowded Elevator"" from ""Enjoy Incubus"" is in my opinion, probably the best song on the CD. The rest of the songs are simply acoustic remixes of some of the songs on ""Make Yourself."" I can't wait for vol.2 to be released. I definately recommend this CD. Buy it. Support Incubus. That's all I have to say. Peace."
5,Incubus Rocks!,"This CD just confirms the fact that Incubus is one of the best bands out there today. The band members are truly talented, and this CD is a great extension of the ""Make Yourself"" album. Check it out!"
3,"They're attacking, but I'm not running.","This is a real treat for Incubus fans. Although it is a shorter version of the usual album, it is still a fine example of their work."
5,Acoustic is very nice!,"If your a fan of this band you'll appreciate their efforts on this EP. I found the acoustic verisons to be excellent and Brandon voice has amazing range. Crowed Elevtors is a great track and favorite things and Pardom were perforemd live. GET the new CD coming out in Oct, and try to catch these guys live to all fans out there. BUY this CD"
5,Poison For Profit by Mac McKinnon,Mysterious and intriguing. Well researched. Leaves you wondering what was going on in the mind of Tim Scroggin. Fascinating story!! I loved it!!
4,It's her voice that makes these great songs continually great.,"What I am consistently drawn to in these song performances by Patti and her group are the openess of the arrangements and her better than ever beautiful voice. I have always enjoyed her voice in poetic balladic grace, political edge, poigancy and rock-n-roll rebellion. But, there is something truly enraptured in her love for this handful of songs. Great anyway and continued greatness carried by this delivery. I'm enjoying this record alot and it is a finely tuned covers collection until her muse brings her another original record. My suggestion, buy it, enjoy it and don't over analyze it."
3,Really Amazing,"I am a huge fan of Patti Smith. I love her attitude, her creativity, and her outspoken activism. She has a distinctive voice and style. Her induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was well deserved. I wasn't sure how well that voice and style would work a covers album and, to my surprise, it works quite well. This is a surprisingly good and interesting release. My favorite is Within You, Without You. I am astonished that she could pull this off as well as she has. My problem with this release is that there is nothing on this disc that is as interesting as Patti Smith performing her own songs."
4,Patti Smith twelve CD,"I love Patti Smith and I love this CDThe shipping was fastI would highly recommend this CD if your a Patti Smith FanShe does covers of other peoples songs like are you experienced?gimmie shelter, smells like teen spirit etc."
4,Forever a Patti fan,"I'm only rating this 4 stars because I'm a bit dissapointed that it's not new material. I think most of the covers are great (especially ""Smells like Teen Spirit""). Hoping she comes out with a new album soon."
2,Did she really cover Nirvana????!!!!!!,"It's odd to try to rate a cover album done by someone who is considered to be one of rock and roll's greatest.Some of the tracks here are interesting to hear in her mellow voice, and her Patti Smith style. But, some are just tragic. Smells like teen spirit is a trainwreck at best. And a banjo? No, Patti SMith....just don't ever go there again. And everybody wants to rule the world. It's not so bad in her tone, but it's very close to the original. I guess I would expect more originality from her.Some of the other covers are good. There's an Allman Brothers cover, and Neil Young cover, and some are well done, and interesting to hear her sing. She has such a unique voice and style that I think you either love her or you hate her. Here....I just don't quite know what to think. It's half good, half bad, mixed with part tragic. If you listen to it you'll know what I mean. Her producer should have told her to nix the Nirvana cover."
1,"more mediocre than awful, but Otis Elevator will play it constantly","Mystifying how someone so proud of showing her edge to the world could deliver this album, which sounds like it was recorded in an hour. It can ruin your affection for any of these songs, especially Neil Young's ""Helpless"", which was one of the most beautiful recordings ever made."
2,Just Morbid,After the hype from the radio and print reviews that she spent 20 years putting her favorite pieces together (and the list of truly great songs) I took the plunge.Don't fall for it. The renditions are morbid and largely lifeless (oddly matching her facial expressions in the accompanying photos). The comment about this being future fodder for Otis elevator muzak is right on.If you want signs of life and passion go see her husband John McEnroe hit a tennis ball. He's still got it in spades.
1,Hideous,She did a bluegrass cover of Smells Like Teen Spirit. Bluegrass. How can you miss the point of a song that completely? How is it possible?The only songs here that she hasn't completely butchered (Gimme Shelter for example) are the ones that are so similar to their original versions that you might as well listen to the originals.
1,I Don't Get It!!!,"Can somebody explain to me why we even listen to Patti Smith? I saw her recent performance on a CBS morning show and it was terrible. She butchered classic songs from Tear For Fears and the Rolling Stones. It was absolutely embarrassing to watch. Why has Patti Smith ever been relevant? Would we even know who she was if she didn't come from New York (you can include Lou Reed in this question). To me, she isn't even a has-been....more of a never-was. Also, a memo to the artists(?) who are now producing cover song albums.....do not do it! You are lowering yourself to what it ws like before you ever gained fame. Is Brian Ferry listening? At least he did produce some great stuff in the past.Patti Smith can thank god for: New York, Rolling Stone magazine, and a hall of fame (in Cleveland no less)willing to showcase items such as a cub scout uniform for Jim Morrison....LOL (I required to rate a minimum of 1 star)."
2,Some of it works...,"...and some it had me begging for original material; especially not needed was the TFF song, which was played to death in the 80's and I certainly didn't welcome hearing it again. Good try, nonetheless. My favorite track has to be ""Changing of the Guards"". Patti brings her superb style to it and is essential listening. ""Within You Without You"" also is done justice. All in all, a nice side project but this only serves to whet the appetite for all-new stuff from Patti."
5,I DONT CARE IS A PHAT SONG!,"the Pendulum # 2 contains the song ""I don't Care"" which is a phat song! its a dark lotus(Icp & Twiztid) song and when Dark Lotus comes out I bet their will be more songs like this one! But for now get this cause its phat!"
3,I Don't Care,"This CD is definitely a ninja-only single. If you don't like I.C.P., you problably won't like this song or the comic book much less. This is more of a Zug Izland(Psychopathic Records' alternative group) type of song, complete with guitar riffs and strange vocals featuring Twiztid. I like this song but its not one of my favorites. I don't listen to it much but I'd miss it if I didn't have it. All the big-time Psychopathic fans will problably want this one, but I'm sure alot of ninjas agree with me, this is not for anybody just getting introduced to I.C.PBry-Bry(Gangsta-Style)"
4,Good swinging session for Stephane and Barney,"I'm a jazz guitarist and jazz record collector. This is one of those albums that I listened to a lot when I was getting into jazz guitar. The spirit of this album is delightful. Stephane bringing his eloquent, Parisian swing, and Barney bringing his Charlie Christian rooted bebop fireworks. Fans of hard swinging jazz will love this album. As a guitar player, the initial draw was Barney Kessel. I love much of Barney on this session. Hearing his chordal backing of Grappelli is delightful (as I've always loved Barney's vocabulary of chords), and his solos are always hard swinging, though I must confess, he has a penchant for a few sweeping arpeggiated licks that seem to come up far too often......I say far too often because he tended to get a bit sloppy with this schtick, at times. With that niggle aside, this is a fine album that is almost certainly to delight the listener."
2,Didn't work for me,"Login page would not come up. Called tech support but they were not able to help and suggested I exchange it. I returned it. One nice thing about this product is that you are automatically escallated to the top tech support guys.This unit was for a friend. I have used use the previous version of this product for about 2 years and it also had a buggy firmware but it does work. I was very frustrated with this product too because it didn't work out of the box either. It required several firmware upgrades before it was finally functional.I gave it 2 stars because we decided not to exchange, we returned it. So you might have better luck."
3,america,movie is interesting but somewhat predictable. falls short of expectations. had to watch movie for a psych class. wondered why teacher chose this movie.
1,How Did This Movie Get 5-star reviews?,"In a word:awful. The script was horrific. There was no character development to speak of. They never even say some of the character's names. As a movie about the foster care system some parts were portrayed accurately, but other aspects were completely wrong."
5,Excellant source of Catholic theology.,I lead a Bible study for 5 years using The Navarre Commentaries.They are a safe source for the truth about what the Bible means. The commentary uses extensive quotes from the Early Church Fathers and The Catechism of The Catholic Church.
4,I was pleased with the product,"This is a good product, but not as highly pigmented as other Paula Dorf eye shadows. The colour was as expected."
4,Nice book.,"Nice story by Gaiman, not a master piece but close enought.Kept me hooked to the book until the end (not too hard since the book is short).Nice idea of a murder in heaven, even more interesting the ending; not that surprising though, but still a good reading."
2,Lame,"This was a real disappointment, a corny murder mystery involving angels in heaven. There was zero suspense and the author just had to throw in the obligatory p.c. gay love scene. The poor writing aside, I did give it 2 stars for the high quality of the artwork."
4,warning! aquired tastes only!,"ok, heres the deal with koufax. theyre a great band but you need a broad music appreciation to enjoy the record. they are like the 80's newwave, meets 70's billy joel, meets the new synth sound of the post punk world. if you can appreciate slow rockin songs then go for it. rocjk and roll is here to stay."
3,It made me laugh,"I'm a total alcoholic so I appreciate the concept of this book. I even applied the principles of the book last night while I drank 6 beers. On an empty stomach. I do feel pretty great today and rode my bike in; but, in all honesty, I never get hangovers anymore. He makes very few references to those that have actual problems with alcohol and anyone that needs a supplement chart for drinking 4 to 9 drinks or *gasp* OVER ten drinks, probably has a problem. And no mention that alcohol destroys your brain. No supplement can help you there. Also, I was confused as to when i can actually start eating normal food again...And if you really drank every day, i don't think you'd have TIME to eat, since you can only drink on an empty stomach!! HOWEVER, all that being said, i will continue to drink and use the information i've gained from this book. It might even cut down on my drinking since his program really is a lot of work...cheers!"
5,Smashin' UK artist.,"I heard this single while I was in the Guess store and I asked the cashier who the artist was. So I immediately came to amazon and hunted like a dog to find Mekon and to find out the entire Cd isn't to be released until 2010. Luckily I found the single and I knew I was going to be pleased. Mekon is definitely on the way to the United States and when her arrival comes, she's going to set the scene on fire. But be the first and order the single now and be the first to gain the hype experience!!"
2,Good acting but a dark and depressing series,"I bought this 1st season after reading so many pro-reviews. I have to say I can't agree. Fine acting, sure, but the last thing I want to see after another depressing day at work is a series that reminds us of all the religious hate in this world.Not one moment in this series did I ever smile, let alone laugh.Dark and depressing.I couldn't help but feel like the show was trying to brainwash me into understanding why extremist muslims do what they do.This series, as well as it is acted, is anything BUT entertaining.It's DEPRESSING.I wish I could get a refund not just for my money, but for my time watching it."
1,Language bad,"This was so bad on the language that my 34 year old son MOM do not watch it, you will not like it."
1,not what i expected,"I watched this first episode out of curiosity because everyone is raving about Homeland and it won all the awards at the Emmy's. However, I wasn't that impressed and don't care to find out what happens next."
2,"Good Start, Poor Ending","This was a show I was really excited about watching and one that had a lot of potential. Unfortunately, it never really lived up to that potential. There was some good acting, particularly by Mandy Patinkin, playing the mentor of Claire Dames' CIA officer. Any scene he was in was fun to watch, the way he interacted with the other characters. Damian Lewis also did a good job, but the underlying motivations for his character were far too shallow to explain his actions.I would say that the first two thirds of this show were solid four-star material, but regrettably things started going downhill and finally fell apart all together in the final three episodes as the heroine came apart at the seams(an effect that was more annoying than dramatic) and the producers took the easy way out. The final moments of the show hint at a Season 2, but I won't be in any rush to watch it."
1,no joy,your server did not function. I never saw the show yet I was billed. How can you charge foe something not received?
1,Really good,I thought that seeing the shows in sequence was very good as you did not lose the what was going on. I look forward to the next season. This is spy thriller that relates to possible real world situations.
1,"Audio repeated the words actors were saying, approximately 2 minutes ahead of speaking","There is something wrong with the audio on this episode. The audio is messed up. There are 2 audio's going on at the same time. You hear the actors speaking current, and then you also hear about a 2minute advance audio at the same time. VERY ANNOYING.Hope all episodes Amazon is offering is not of this quality."
1,Bad DVD,It was good until the last 30 minutes of the season and the DVD went bad so we missed the best part.
2,"""scratchy""","I love Homeland! however around the middle of the season on this dvd set, there were scratches: irregular picture and audio. Luckily I had caught the end of the first season at the beginning of the 2nd season so I did not feel compelled to sit through the agony."
2,Ok,This was a boring trailer I was surprised with it it should have had more that Should have been given.
3,"Begins well, then tanks","Homeland was a great series that began well. Each week there was more intense drama non-stop; however, the last two episodes were not the best. An okay series, but there's too many cliffhangers at the end, so I won't be watching season 2. This would have been a great mini-series."
1,Disappointing,"Tried to watch with adult children based on rating, however the explicit sex in the first four episode was incredibly inappropriate and unnecessary. Will not finish, and would not recommend to anyone."
1,Disgraceful,"What a disappointment that what was a potentially intriguing plot was so x rated. Why do so many private activities have to be included in this show?!Not only that, it was very slow moving. Homeland is horrible."
5,Homeland grows on you,Just started watching Season 1 when we had a free weekend of Showtime on cable. Took me awhile to get into the show but now am hooked. Watched the last 4 episodes through the Amazon Video Library
3,Homeland Season 1,"It's okay but it's too soap-operaish for my taste. I've watch 3 segments, so I'll give it a chance before I make my final decision."
5,Look Out Taliban and Al Qaeda....,This one kicks some major terrorist butt!! Characters are so believable.....except for Brody - I think they missed the mark on that one.
4,Defective DVDs,"We were never able to watch the DVD of the first season because we were never able to finish the series. Amazon's DVDs were defective. We orderred and received two different sets of the first season and they both were scratched, or they hesitated and stopped in the same spots. We'll try and buy this from someone else, ie, Target, Walmart, who may have gotten a different cut of the same series.Mary Jo Busby"
4,very good series,"very good series. interesting, kept me coming back as often as i could to watch the next episode. looking forward to season 2!"
4,Good show,Interesting although maybe a little exaggerated especially in the rendition of Carrie's behavior taking chances with other people's life's and ignoring her chain of command.
3,"Everything was going well, until....","Episode 9 would play for approximately 11 minutes and then it would die. It didn't matter which player I used to watch it with, it would not play. Paying for a season and then one episode doesn't play, leaves a disappointed customer."
5,great,great TV show but Amazon states something strange here about the Bluray product: it is one disc. Either this is a mistake or the sign of something unfortunate since all sites OTHER than Amazon list the Bluray as having 3 discs.
1,Don't waste your time.,"Turned it off, Ugly! Offensive!! Don't waste your time and money, not worth it. That is all i have to say."
2,too intense,"I don't want to be reminded of what we, as a nation, do. The cast is excellent but don't make it more palatable to me."
2,"Predictable, silly and BORING!!!","Big fan of many HBO and AMC shows (Boardwalk Empire, Game of Thrones, Mad Men, Breaking Bad, etc). Also avid reader of military/CIA thrillers. This showed seemed a perfect fit given the subject matter and positive reviews.Purchased season 1 from Amazon (always great). This show is predictable, silly and just plain boring. Watched 5 episodes hoping it would get better. It did not. I do not know how this won so many awards. The acting is horrible and I have little sympathy for ANY character. Claire Danes' portrayal of a crazy, off the rails CIA agent is difficult to watch. Damian Lewis is unbelievable from the start (not the fact that he is a terrorist). He is ""over acting"" every scene and his dialect is not right. Turns out he is a British actor. Not that I have anything against British actors it is just poor casting for this role.Try to see an epsiode or two to see if this show is for you before you waste your money"
5,Good watch,"I love this series. It's smart and topical and well-written. I'm always glad to find a show where I can't wait to see the next episode. This one doesn't have a lot of ""movie stupid"" in it either (as in, characters doing something really dumb just to further the plot)...wish there were more shows like this."
4,Interesting but a bit slow,The program won an Emmy so people like it but the first two episodes spend too much time gazing at the protagonist staring at a surveillance camera. Still there was quite a bit of tension and it is an interesting story ...
5,Riveting from first episode to last..,Never had heard of the program until the awards were handed out and then I got interested. I watched all episodes on my Kindle Fire and they were excellent. Downloaded with no trouble; watched at my leisure whether in the car waiting for bus to arrive or at night when I could not sleep. Just a great program and now that I have to watch this seasons on TV episode by episode it is dragging at bit but still an excellent program. Well worth the cost.
5,Fave!,"Love this show! Well written, acted and directed! I don't know anyone who doesn't love this show! Well worth the cost to pay for the season."
4,So good,"This show is exciting, heart wrenching and so well written. I hate that I have to wait to see season 2 until it comes on Amazon!"
4,Engrossing,"Definitely catches and keeps your interest. You can't be sure which characters to trust, and as you gather clues as to who really is the traitor, your list of suspects grows! Very good entertainment."
2,Not a family film,"I had heard this series was similar to 24, so I was excited to rent it and check it out. Hubby and I love spy, military type thrillers and this started off fantastic. Since there is no rating on this show, I assumed it was okay for TV viewing, but I was wrong. Please do not watch this with children in the room. My husband and I ended up watching the entire show due to the interesting premise, but by the end, we found we didn't like the main CIA character at all and the sex, nudity and language were enough to deter us from watching anymore in the series."
4,"HOMELAND scores a real ""winner""","If the President watches this series, it must be worthwhile! The best thing about this new and thrilling series is that it is written intelligently and provides a full helping of thrills and suspense. I believe there is also a message for not only the USA but for all other countries. ""We need to be constantly alert"". The balance is not to become overly fearful but to raise our consciousness that we all need to play a part in keeping ourselves safe from evildoers. We share a common responsibility to thwart evil.The British actor playing the role of Brady is a perfect casting homerun. He is a master of 'facial expressions' that can make you feel the stress, the fear, the terror and the love that his character struggles with every day. We can all relate to some of those emotions and certainly to the internal struggle of good and evil. Brady is us!"
5,Homeland,Smart show-excellent cast. I was hooked from the start. Every episode is exciting. I can't wait to see season two.
5,GREAT SHOW .... MORE TWIST AND TURNS THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE.,"I WATCH THIS SHOW ON TV AND STARTED BY COLLECTING THE FIRST SEASON. I FIND IT SUSPENSEFUL AND INTERESTING, YOU NEVER REALLY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT EACH EPISODE. CARRIE IS A HEROINE WITH PROBLEMS, SHE HAS SO MANY LEVELS, I FEEL FOR HER AND ENJOY THE CHARACTER'S INTERACTIONS. WORTH WATCHING IN RE-RUNS OR JUST BUY THE SERIES AND SET DOWN ON A WEEKEND AND INDULGE YOURSELF."
5,Super show!,Just a great show! I recommend to anyone who wants a mystery action suspense thriller. I look forward to seeing season 2
5,Awesome show,Great characters and great storyline. One of the few shows on tv that kept us interested til the very end.
4,Less is more,I just started watching this show and I absolutely love the story line. The only thing I wish was different is the nudity and language. I'm still trying to figure out why people think that a show needs these things in order to be good. The story can stand on its own and I wish they would let it.
5,Great Series... Looking forward to Season2,This is one of those that is truly difficult to piece meal. You get hooked and want to watch back-to-back...
1,Desperately hammy stuff.,"The line on the box, ""From the producers of '24'"" says it all. This is a simplistic, ponderous, turgid, self-important parade of cliches. I got it because it was recommended for people who liked The Killing and other Nordic noir series, but it doesn't come anywhere close to them in characterization, complexity or sophistication. Avoid."
5,Great series,"Without access to Showtime, this provided a great opportunity to see this Emmy decorated program. I have Uverse internet and was able to view in the highest resolution with no stops or other video problems."
4,Claire Danes Face,"So many faces by Claire. This show is amazing and very intense. I definitely recommend watching it, especially if you liked 24."
4,Good Show,"It's not HBO, but Showtime has created a good series, it gets pretty boring at times but all in all, it's worth watching"
3,Homeland,"Was great at first. Then got too politically predictable. US bad, Islam good. Terrorists have a""good"" reason to hate us and blow us up. Really?"
5,Homeland Season 1,Love everything about this series. Acting is superb. Story has many twists that you don't expect. Very suspenseful. Everything you want in a show.
5,AMAZING!,"Haven't had showtime for a while, so i missed this gem in realtime. Got Season 1 on N'flix and finished it in one long marathon. Can't WAIT for season 2."
5,Wow - what a season,Homeland presents an outstanding storyline. The cast seems to fit very well together and the acting is just outstanding. A must see for any 24 fan!
4,Great series,"Great series, and easy to buy, download and convenient for me to switch to my Sony Blu-ray to watch. No need for me to wait for Netflix DVD."
2,Didn't enjoy,"I never finished the series. While I know some others who really enjoyed this series, I found the main female character a distraction from the storyline. Her storyline was a little over the top and hard to relate to. Most people would have a hard time relating to her or her choices/actions. Her actions were over the top, but not in a good way. It was just too far-fetched for me (maybe because I'm involved with Federal law enforcement and have a security clearance and boundries?)Without giving something away that's all I can really say about the series. I do, however, hope other people enjoy it. There is some entertainment value with the other actors in the series; it just wasn't for me."
4,Fantastic.,"Whoever is responsible for casting the actors in this series deserves high praise. Everyone is pitch perfect -- including the supporting characters. There's a defining moment about half-way through the season that literally put my jaw on the floor. Oh yes, they went there. One of my new favorite shows!"
4,"more ""making of"" pieces please","So, the big deal about streaming is....streaming. What I miss is the behind-the-scenes ""making of"" pieces wherein the creators talk about what's going on. And getting to hear Claire talk about what's in Carrie's head is nice, not long enough, and nice."
2,The Joker is a CIA agent,"Heath Ledger in The Joker make-up would have been a more believable CIA agent involved in a top case. Clare Danes was great as a manic wild-eyed lunatic...however, she was awful(the writing)as anything resembling a big time CIA agent. This overblown glob goes downhill early on, but the pace it achieves makes for a catastrophic plot crash at the end. We won't talk about the plot twist that defy brain cells."
1,Do not use this seller!!!,"I bought this supposedly new. However, upon receiving the second and third Dvd were defective and the fourth one had commercials. I was forced to give one star otherwise I couldn't write a review. Very dissatisfied."
1,More lies about Muslims,"This should be rated R. I was not amused by graphic display of intercourse in first 5 minutes. I simply am not interested in how the government manipulates these things. I didn't buy this series and do not know where it came from. I'll give you that we have some nasty enemies, but very few Muslims are involved."
5,Simply Brilliant,It's almost as if the actors are flawed in real life. Goes beyond the typical terrorism drama to ask the deep questions noone wants to ask.
5,Love it!,Action packed! It will keep you on the edge of your seat. Clare Danes is great! I would definitely recommend it!
5,Best series in years,"Totally captivating! Addicting! Get it....Watch it in order.....Then order season 2 and 3......you will not regret this purchase! Fabulous storyline, excellent actors!"
4,"A New ""24""","I stumbled upon Homeland when I was searching for something like ""24,"" which my husband and I enjoyed. I like Homeland even better because it seems more..possible. The twists and turns are surprising, and the characters more fully-fleshed-out than just the heavy breathing when there's a crisis. LOL Unfortunately, we have watched all of Season 1 and Season 2 is not available because it is currently being run on Showtime. That is a bit frustrating, but we will not be adding any more expenses to our cable bill..."
2,The beginning is the best,"I think the first 7 episodes of Homeland are very good but after that it is not realistic that the wife of the imam comes to visit Carrie, behind the back of her husband, I think in real that never happens. The portrait of the imam is painted very idealistic, it promotes islam. For me I will look no further, overhere we have too much trouble with islam."
1,Avoid - don't contaminate your mind,I got this based on the fact I really like the show Life the man was in before which got canceled. This is just straight pornography 30 min in the first episode and that was too much for me I should have stopped after his wife was in the bed with his best friend but after I skipped past that I thought it would get better 2 sex scenes and at least 3 f words in 30 min something no one's mind needs to see. Not just not for families not for adults either. I realize I should have done more checking before I got this movie and that was my fault. This is just a word of warning to anyone else out there that is concerned about what they let in their mind.
2,Too graphic,I was too offended by the language and sex scenes. Storylines don't need either of these to get a story point through. We used to have better writers and producers who could do that.
2,No Captioning!,No Captioning! This is 2012! How could you allow me to purchase a product without captaining?Also voices sound and lips were slightly off kilter!
4,Suspenseful,"I have only watched a couple of episodes upon recommendation of close friends and they are right, I'm hooked. My husband is not so enthralled though, so not sure we will be viewing this series together..."
4,We loved this series,We enjoyed the series so much that I have sent the first series to my son who will no doubt enjoy it as much as we did
3,American soldier turned Muslim....,Interesting plot. It's like 'Prisoners of War' only American style. I liked the show but there was too much cursing.
1,Massive rip off,A Super series but the disc that arrived that was bought from Amazon is only useable on DVD machines in the US and Canada but not in Australia (something only found in the small print) Couldn't watch a minute and left to sort out a return. Rip Off!
1,I though it was good...until the end,"This new series started on top,but with the nonsense last two episode :they killed it!!!!, I don't like the series that I have to see the complete season to know whats going to happen at the end,but like 24 I made an exception....Wrong decision! It seems they are going to make a few seasons before to know a few things ,my advice don't buy it if you don't want to lose your money and time,go for ""Person of interest"" or ""Hawaii Five- O"" .I won't be watching season 2,i'm totally disappointed."
5,Great show!,"Started watching this show after the awards it was nominated for. I love it, very suspenseful! Just when you feel you have things figured out, they mix it up."
1,Pornography... Really?,"I admit I have been out of the weekly television viewing audience for a long time. Circumstances are that I have some time and desire for dull entertainment that does just that, entertains. But when did we become so complacent about pornography? Is it so commonplace that it is needed to satisfy our senses? I'm not a prude, but I sure don't need to see envy gesticulation, mammary gland, and hand stroke to get the idea of the scene. If this is what we need to feel entertained, we are in trouble. I bought the first season, watched the first four episodes to give it a chance but am deleting it from my iPad. I won't make this mistake again."
5,Amazing,"Not wholly convincing, but emotionally compelling and brilliantly acted. Masterfully braided story lines provide shocking twists and turns. Watched entire season in one week, couldn't stop."
2,Not as good as the hype,"Even the great performances, especially by Mandy Patinkin and the ever-amazing Claire Danes, don't compensate for the rather mediocre scripts - mediocre as compared to something like The Wire or Breaking Bad. In particular, the reason for turning into a terrorist was weak, and ultimately unbelievable. Not enough chills, spills and revelations. Kind of disappointed with this series; especially considering the hype surrounding it. Given up on Season 2."
2,It didn't have to be this way,"I watched the first episode of season one. I love this kind of genre and I was looking forward to watching the series. But I'm afraid it includes too much language, nudity and violence for my taste."
5,Homeland is an all-star!,Great story line and superb acting makes Homeland a must-see. My husband and I watched season one over a two day period. Very addicting
1,Missing 2nd Disc,"I think the program is great, in fact so good that when we realized there were two Disc 3s instead of a Disc 2, we were bereft. Now I have to return the three discs (at my own postage expense) and get a new set... and likely pay postage on that too???Hmmmm..... Something is not right."
2,Nudity and language is offensive.,I deleted this series after viewing the first episode. The nudity was not important to the storyline and the language seemed forced. I've known former pow's and they were still able to control their language.
1,Good story line but a lot of graphic sex/nudity...,"Honestly - there is a lot of sex and nudity...only made it through 2.5 episodes when we realized it wasnt going to go away...a lot of people recommended this to us - so we really didnt expect it...it did seem to be a strong story line, so not certain why they had to put all the graphic (and it is pretty graphic) sex...bummed about it..."
2,Poor video quality,"I love the show but the best video quality I can get its poor. I have a superfast video connection but the best I can get it for like 380. Which is not even standard definition in the old days. The video streaming doesn't even compare to Hulu, Hulu plus, iTunes, Vudu, etc."
4,Glad it's a series,"I thought this was only going to be a one season deal. Turns out it's a mini-series with an extended life. One thing I don't understand however, and I found it almost irritating was how Brody's wife would refer to Brody AS 'Brody', and not Nick or Nicolas. When does a wife refer to her husband by his lastname?It's like, if she doesn't call him by his surname, we as viewers will forget what his name is. Apart from that, it's a good, well-acted series, with some good subplots."
1,Massively over rated garbage,"Claire Danes is great, but the series lacks any sense of excitement. None of the characters is sympathetic. I was hoping they would all die so this would end. More time is spent cutting hair than developing any sort of plausible plot line. To compare this to 24 is an insult to a wonderful show that, even at its worst, far surpassed the occasional moments of interest in this rubbish. The nudity does not spoil the show, it merely provides a break from the tedium. Save your money. No-one I know enjoyed this."
1,4th DVD Disc Was Blank!!,"I had never seen Homeland and a friend highly recommended I watch it. Since Season One was NOT available through my cable provider I purchased Season One on Amazon. Even though I bought a USED disc set (4 discs in season 1) the package arrived in a sealed cellophane wrapper. I had knee replacement surgery on 1/3/2013 and was going to be convalescing at home for several weeks (perfect time to watch 12 hours of programming!). I rapidly viewed the first 9 episodes on the first three discs and was EXTREMELY disappointed to find out that disc #4 was BLANK!!EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING to put it mildly. The program was some of the best television programming I have ever seen, so I was completely disappointed to have an incomplete set of discs. I was going to lend it to friends and neighbors to watch, but it doesn't do much good NOT to be able to finish the series."
2,homeland cd's,"not a new cd, there was scribbling on the covers of all the cd' s we were very unhappy because we thought we getting new cd's"
3,"Homeland, like real life.","Instead of the phrenetic pace of ""24"" or other high pitched spy thrillers, this show is plodding, understated and sometimes down right boring - somewhat like real life. The idea is great, you just have to have a tolerance for the slow pace and the sometimes downright mundane approach to spy craft and the lives of spies. It reminds me of ""Tinker, Tailor,..."" except that was far more depressing - probably because it took over two hours and this show sets you free from the torture in less than 60 minutes. I gave it 3 stars because they obviously tried hard, but in reality it is only worth two stars."
3,excellent show BUT...,I've never seen such UN-user friendly DVDs! Ultimatley my husband figured out how to crudely navigate from one episode to the next and it was worth it but WTH?
2,GOOD CONCEPT ... BAD EXECUTION,"The first few episodes were promising but the story line quickly falls apart with highly improbable, almost laughable situations with increasingly offensive language. One tires of the Carrie character who seems to dominate the story with her hysterical outbreaks that may be drug induced. If this series is to survive, better writers may have to be brought in."
1,Sad,"I was not expecting porn. The story line was intriguing up until the sex scene 5-7 minutes later. Wish there was a version option. I would have chosen the pg-13, tragically a porn scene enhances the story somehow??????"
2,Too much violence.,"I thought I would like this, but find after one episode that it troubled me too much. There is enough real violence in the world. Sorry I bought it."
2,Homeland Season 1 - predictable,"This show was recomended to me by a number of people, so I elected to download and watch it. I found it lacking in depth, entirely predictable and the acting generally weak."
5,"Amazing, gripping tv show!","I couldn't stop watching this show. The acting is superb and the story is so compelling. In addition, the portrayal of a talented professional (Claire Danes) who is also struggling with a mental illness is thoughtfully and poignantly acted!"
5,Awesome story line,"The story lines in this series were great. I feel as if it may enlighten some people that not all Muslims are terrorists and Americans ARE a very viable source of terrorist groups to use for their goals. It also gives insight into why some people may want to destroy the US, yet also gives you the inner turmoil that they may suffer. Claire Danes' role was incredible. She's smart, dedicated (maybe to an obsessive degree), and is usually right about her gut feelings. The struggles she faces with hiding her psychiatric condition shows her humanity and is such an accurate storyline concerning her being able to remain in the CIA. I recommend this to anyone who likes a fast paced drama with some very believable situations. This show just may open the public's minds to the dangers we still face as a nation."
5,Such an amazing show,We love this show and gave it to my parents as a gift. They're already sucked in. Definitely one of the best shows of last year.
5,This Land is Your Land ...,"I didn't think I was going to like this show, but quickly learned the error of my ways! Relevant - timely - really well-acted and unpredictable."
5,5 stars,Love this first season of homeland. Great acting and action. ONLY for mature audiences. Some of the sex is too much.
4,Great series.,"Clare Danes is a bit dramatic at times, but shines in this series. The only negative is the nudity which makes it unsuitable for kids. I was surprised too see boobs on what I thought was a regular evening cable channel."
4,For the most part very well done.,"I'm and always will be a Damian Lewis fan (Band of Brothers) not quite sure he was right for this role though. Danes does nuts exceptionally well and pretty much owns the series, SPOILER ALERT: I just had a hard time buying the romantic chemistry between her and Lewis. I think he (Lewis) was outstanding in the action, deception and emotional break down scenes, the romantic scenes with Danes on the other hand seemed awkward. A suspenseful all though far fetched story with good solid performances by the leads and supporting actors sans IMO some chemistry issues. One I'll put on my list for a future BR purchase."
5,This show is a must see !,"I didn't watch Homeland Season 1 when it aired on Showtime. I bought the DVD set when it came out. I had heard a lot about the show and wanted to check it out. I was hooked after the first episode, and it kept getting better and better! The acting is phenomenal; Claire Danes is so good in this! I was a fan of 24, but Homeland is way beyond it! I am now a faithful viewer of Season 2 on Showtime."
5,Amazing,This is a compelling series. Great watching experience. Watched the entire season in 3 days. I look forward to season 2.
3,Not as good as the pilot,"I bought this because I watched the pilot and thought it was great. Am a few episodes in, and, I have to saw, the episodes I've seen are OK, but aren't anywhere near as good as the pilot. Haven't seen the whole season yet, so maybe it'll get better. But it's been disappointing to watch what I thought be be a great show just be an OK one."
2,security soap,"So we have not one, but two marines turned into arab wannabes AND a pyschotic basket case CIA officer that needs a constant pharmaceutical supply to function. Where is Roseanne?"
1,TECHNICAL ACCESS PROBLEM,I was never able to access this product despite 50 minutes of trying. comment by Amazon was to try another time. I should not be charged for this product. I don't hate the video; I never saw it !
2,Very sexually explicit!!!,"I like the idea and I the series, but it is very sexually explicit, with probably at least 5 full minutes of it in every episode. I am very very disappointed and think that it is very unfortunate and unnecessary! A waste of my money and time. Thankfully, I paid only a few episodes."
4,Homeland Season One,You can't ask for more drama than Damien Lewis and Claire Danes create! Can't wait for season two..I still can't decide if he's the good guy or the bad guy???
5,I am becoming addicted,This is a really great series. Well written and Well acted. It is extremely thought provoking-not everything is black and white
5,This is a very well done series!,"We bought this so that we could catch up with the Showtime series which, at the time of this review being written, is in season two. Made sense to buy the whole season, rather than rent each show individually. We have Tivo and Cox so cannot get it via Showtime on demand. We have been very happy with the quality of the shows - great purchase!"
5,A review of the Amazon video library (Your Video Library),"Okay, you already know that Homeland is a great TV show. So read my review of the Amazon video library.I bought the entire season 1 of Homeland via my Kindle Fire. It is then on Amazon Instant Video > Your Video Library. So whenever we want to watch an episode, I pick-up my Kindle Fire, open the web browser, chose the Amazon Your Video Library bookmark, chose the episode we want to watch, and designate where we want ot watch it (Kindle Fire or Tivo). Within minutes we're watching.It's very easy to use."
4,Gripping story. Gratuitous nudity and sex.,"I was hooked by the first episode's premise and great writing. The story is really good, with twists and turns and well-developed characters. But as someone who finds even soft porn disgusting, the first 4 or 5 episodes were over the top. Too bad Showtime feels the same need as HBO and others to exploit their freedom in that area."
2,Looks Very Used!! Supposed to be New...,"I ordered this DVD as New as a Christmas gift. When the DVD arrived , the whole thing appears to have been sitting in someones basement for years unopened. The outer casing is chipping and splitting in areas and there is dust and dirt under the stickers. Very disgusting. The actual packing box was undamaged. I should have just bought this locally instead of trying to save some extra money. Shame!"
3,Homeland: The Complete First Season,Homeland: The Complete First Season. Poor ending. Poor video. Couldn't find the beginning of one show to the next. Must have been bootlegged.
5,home land season 1,I like both 1 and 2 hopes there is a 3 Best show on tvlike it a lot and cant wait for 3
5,Homeland Pilot,Very interesting concept for a new show. May download rest of the first season since I don't get this on my cable plan.
5,Outstanding,What a fantastic show. It's one of the best dramatic series around and I can't wait to see every next episode. Buy this series if you are the least bit inclined.
5,Good show,My wife and I really like this show....we are bummed we caught up and have to wait for season 3 to start. We recommend it.
5,Great show,The show is really good. It is relevant to the times and is gripping. We watched the entire season one and two in two nights...could not turn it off.
4,Homeland Pilot,Excellent beginning to the show.It is a fast paced and well thought out intro to our country and the espionage community after 9/11. The main characters are given brief introductions allowing for growth in future episodes. I urge you to try thisshow
5,Where is season 2,"Absolutely love this show, have been waiting and waiting for Season 2 to appear, have no idea why it is not available to watch on Instant video's. Even tried to call to find out, they had no answere. Really bummed!"
5,Couldn't stop at just one!,"It's so unfair that Amazon kept charging per episode. I kept having to purchase the next in the series because I needed to know what was going to happen. Amazon, ""you suck!"""
5,A Contemporary Rashomon,I am on the edge of my seat in suspense throughout each segment. No pat answers. Cannot anticipate the next surprise.
5,Late comer to the series,Great series and easy to download. A little pricey in my opinion but we are enjoying it. Picture quality is very good.
5,adventure,This is a really riveting series with lots of action and tough human relations. Good to follow week after week.
5,Chemistry,From the minute this episode opened there was instant chemistry. And....it proved to be the real thing. Marine One and Marine Two ended season 1. PerfectlyThanks for offering it on instant video !
5,.Homeland is Awesome!,The entire season is incredible. You're on the edge of your seat at the end of every episode.The roles for each character have a depth lacking in other shows which only adds to how hooked you become.Watch it and be amazed.
4,Fast start but can it sustain the pace?,After all the hype from friends I had to see for myself. The story and cast did not disappoint. Will probably pick up season 1 now and binge.
4,Could use more action,"The show has a lot of suspense, but I found it to be very slow-moving at times, with the plot taking forever to unfold. The last couple of episodes had me on the edge of my seat, but it shouldn't have taken to so long to get to that point. I will, however, order season 2 when it comes out, as I have to know what happens next!"
4,Review,"Btw, I saw the first installment and then bought the season. Is there a rebate for the 1.99 on the first episode because I bought the season."
5,RIveting!,Wonderful series...had us on the edge of the couch..couldn't wait to see the next episode! Looking forward to Season 2 release.
4,"It's like 24, but with nudity!","Homeland is a great series to watch, and much better than the usual nightly trash on tv. Riveting, exciting, suspenseful, it makes you think if there is a Manchurian Candidate out there?"
4,"What happens when you drop an ""F"" bomb into every sentence?","Your sentences are twice as long as they need to be. Besides which it does not take any creativity or thought to add vulgarity to a script. And it is distracting.That said, I turned on my internal ""F"" bomb filter, and watched the whole season. Some of the plot twists seemed implausible, but the story was good enough to keep me engaged. Claire Danes is amazing. I'm ready for the second season as soon as Amazon Prime will let me download it."
4,Great show!,"I wouldn't call this one of ""the greatest shows of all time,"" but it's not far off that list either."
5,Addictive!,It was all and more it promised to be! Keep me on the edge of my seat and up all night several nights to finish it!
5,great series,This series keeps you hanging on the edge of your seat. Can't wait for the 2nd season out on dvd
1,Instant video streaming doesn't work.,"This is the second time I've tried purchasing content to stream through Amazon Instant, and the second time that it hasn't worked. I've complained to customer service and have not been able to get a refund. I'm considering canceling my subscription to Prime because of the bad quality and poor customer service experience. I did not want to complain about Homeland as I really love the show, but I had no other option to voice my advice to all other customers - do not purchase content through Amazon Instant."
5,Claire Danes is Hot,"Claire Danes - she's the primary reason why I'm watching this series. She stars as Carrie Mathison, a highly strung, pill-popping CIA counter-terrorism officer on a mission to undercover a mole that that turned by the enemy. She set her sights on Sgt. Nicholas Brody, a US Marine who has been rescued after spending 8 years in captivity. The TV series takes it on from there.Who cares about how this series ends?If Claire Danes is on screen, I'm tuning in! In this series, she looks so sizzling in that grey suit, her hair is so pristine, her makeup is flawless, she looks so adorable even when acting angry, what else would I need to know about the plot?"
3,Homeland Review,The acting is very good and the episodes are well written and suspenseful. I was just surprised atthe nudity - it's not necessary and it's offensive!
1,disappointed,"After reading all the positive reviews, I expected that this would be a series worth watching. Unfortunately, it wasn't. I did not realize that such explicit sexual scenes would be on this and the language is shocking! I will not recommend this show to anyone. Nudity, explicit sex, and filthy language.Very Disappointed!!!"
1,IT'S A SOAP OPERA!!!,"it's a SOAP hooking you to keep watching even though it's all about 'relationships - ugh' with a very thin plot. and its anti-military, anti-CIA propaganda is not even subtle."
1,"America bad, terrorist good.","I just watched 2/3 of season one. What have I learned so far? America is a bad, bad country. Evil CIA. Evil military. Evil FBI. Evil Vice President. But terrorists are really great people who are just misunderstood. If only they had the chance to torture more Americans we'd all realize just how great they are. Other than that inspiring message and lots of nudity there's really nothing here."
1,No Thanks,Cannot believe the amount of nudity in this TV series. No thank you!My husband and I weree both offended by it. Too bad because we really like the main actor.
2,"Overhyped, stereotyped","I had heard so many good things about this show, but after watching the first two episodes, I think I'm done. It's got an ""idiot plot"" (Siskel and Ebert's old definition of a plot that only moves forward because characters act like idiots), hackneyed dialogue, lots of ugly imagery, and so far, nothing much to recommend it. If someone can point me to better episodes, I'll give them a try, since I made the mistake of buying the entire first season."
5,Addictive!!,"Clare Danes is gritty and believable as Carrie, a bi-polar CIA agent, navigating her way through using her high intellect to successfully perform her job as well as the downfall of the same in her personal life. POW Nick Brody is rescued after 8 years of captivity under the terrorist Abu Nazir. It is Carrie's job to decide whether or not he is a hero or a turned agent with a plan to take vengeance on the U.S.Seriously good t.v."
4,it is gripping,I am enjoying watching this series. Each episode makes you want to watch the next one. The twists and turns are very good.
3,Not what title implied,It was not what the caption implied. Was suppose to be 1st episode and only an interview instead of the show.
5,HOMELAND,"Homeland is one of the best ""spy"" dramas series on cable. Damian Lewis, Claire Danes, and Mandy Patinkin add just the right touch of intensity that keeps me glued to the TV set!"
5,Got me hooked!,"Never thought I would like a TV series as much as Breaking Bad, but here it is. Outstanding in every way."
3,Pretty far-fetched story line,It took me three episodes to begin to get interested in the characters. I don't like red-haired men so that takes warming up to. Grew drawn to the love affair between the two leads but hated Danes becoming goofy at the end of the season. Pretty convoluted plot that turned me off.
5,Love it!,The acting is superb and the story line is intense. I can't wait to see more from this show! Bravo!
5,sooooo good!,the only negative thing i can say about this show is that i could not quit watching it! seriously one of the best shows on!
5,Riveting Performance,"Both my wife and I could not wait watching a few episodes per night, until we finished the entire series. Great entertainment."
5,Buy it,"Thrilling, well crafted and tight. It leaves you craving more. This is the best that television has to offer. Claire Danes is Emmy worthy."
5,Hooked,"I convinced my husband to watch the pilot, expecting it to be another show that only one of us liked. (Which means we would never get very far into it, like so many other series.) Happily, that was not the case! Claire Danes is perfect as Carrie, and the rest of the cast are smart and interesting characters. The plot is surprising, and the twists and turns keep you wanting more! We devoured the whole series over 3 days -- a first for us! We will pre-order season 2, for sure!"
1,"Does not work with my Smart LG 55"" HDTV.","Does not work with my Smart LG 55"" HDTV. Acts like it is playing but there is no picture or sound. Netflix works thru the TVs WIFI. If you want to sell this stuff make sure it works first."
1,Homeland: The Complete First Season.,"Homeland: The Complete First Season. This series should have been marked ""soft porn"" because of the nudity and graphic sex scenes."
3,Disappointing,"I had heard that Homeland was just as good as Breaking Bad, Mad Men, and other top-tier shows.Sadly, it's not even in the same ballpark.A passable show? Sure. But several things prohibit it from being in the same class as those mentioned above. First up, the obvious: Does anyone believe that Claire Danes (an über-talented actress) was cast correctly? I don't buy her for a minute here. A petite and attractive blonde CIA agent? I have a hard time on this one.Next, things are just too convenient. I can see plot twists coming a mile away and there seemed to be the need to resolve everything within a few episodes.Had this show been hyped less, I would have enjoyed it more."
2,waste of time and money,My own fault for contiuing to buy this. Starts well but then bogs down into repetion and awful writing and direction. Please save your money.
3,"Good Plot, Some Repulsive Things","The plot is plausible and mostly realistic. However, the writers missed realism with the character of the lead gal, who appears educated, intelligent, and focused. People like that don't have a gutter mouth vocabulary as they portray her. The profanity is unnecessary and completely out of character for a person who is a real thinker. Those kinds of people don't need trash words to make their point. They have access to better and more descriptive ways to convey their feelings and ideas. So, it was a huge disappointment in that respect. Otherwise, pretty good show."
2,Homeland First Season,This would be a very good series if there was not so much nudity and profanity. I watched a couple of the discs but could not continue because it was not enjoyable with all the bad stuff.
2,dissapointed,"We really liked the actor in this when he was on LIFE (which was discontinued on tv)but when we watched the first three episodes it was porn.They could not get through an episode without showing plenty of nudity.sorry, there should be some kind of warning at least."
4,Best Show on TV,"We watched all 13 episodes in 2 days. The video was erratic at times, but we got through it. Recommend it for Homeland fans"
4,Gift,Was on Son's gift list. He seemed very happy with it he missed some of the origional episodes and said he will enjoy watching it from beginnin to end.
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"i was amazingly surprised by this tv show, so much so that ive bought season one 4 times for other ppl as gifts. an amazing story line rivaling 24"
4,Awesome... Must see TV,"Really fun show on the topic of National Security, great cast and really solid story threads to follow, I would definitely recommend watching the pilot."
4,Intense,"I like the series but sometimes Clare Dane is too crazy acting for me. I am well acquainted with the FBI and that kind of intensity would alert terrorists,in a heartbeat."
3,Not as good as everyone thinks,"Homeland is not nearly as good as Dexter, AMC's The Walking Dead or Justified. Cant quite figure out how it won so many awards but I guess Hollywood loves to love their own. I have this on DVD and the only reason I'm watching it is because the cable is out due to Hurricane Sandy. I had a feeling I would be disappointed...I am."
5,Addictive!,"Once you start watching this series, you're hooked! Great writing and great casting. I now understand why the show has won so many awards. Awesome!"
4,Homeland,Top notch TV drama. It contains some very exlicit content and is unsuitable for children. But for adult intrigue enthusiasts it is really entertaining.
5,Great,GREAT cast Looks like it deserves the attention it has been getting.I will watch more episodes. I recommend this.
5,Fantastic!!,This was such a pleasure to view the entire season at once. The action was nonstop and phenomenal acting. I highly recommend this DVD>
5,Compelling.,"Great acting. Timely, interesting and eerily current story. There is depth here. I can't wait until I can stay season 2."
5,YES,"Yes, I loved this. I like a spy thriller with some family drama. Lack of family drama was why I didn't like 24 towards the end. it was all about blowing stuff up and shootouts. I wanted to see Keifer Sutherland going home to his wife and doing homework with his kids and dealing with family situations when he wasn't at work. HOMELAND accomplishes this. During work hours it's all work and no play but when the characters go home at night you get relief from all the spy stimuli and enjoy great acting by the supporting cast playing Brody's wife and two kids and a glimpse into Carrie's family life. Dysfunctional as it is."
5,Fantastic!,"I can not wait for Season 2 to be offered on DVD so I can watch it.....since it is on Showtime, I dont get to see it that way. Absolutely amazing story, acting, etc. And it is Pres. Obama's fav show!"
3,Eh,"I was expecting non-stop action and intrigue. It's rather slow and drawn out. Im glad that I only paid $10 because I wouldve been pissed if I paid a penny more. Its entertainment and I am now invested to see what happens in season 2, but again, I will not be paying full price for this series."
4,Pretty Good show minus the love story,Decided to buy this and check it out after so much hype surrounding it and I enjoyed it for the most part. The only thing I didn't care for was the love story between the female agent and the suspect. I felt it was really unnecessary and It did nothing for the story. I wish they would have just stuck with the story of her suspecting him and working towards uncovering it. Once she developed feelings for him the show became a bit annoying because it lost its speed
5,"Homeland, the complete first season","Great story and acting; actually did a marathon for two nights, very engaging and timely. Recommend to everyone who likes timely messages and good spy stories."
5,"Great, timely drama!",Great television for mature audiences. A better value than buying the season DVD or subcribing to Showtime for this single series.
4,IT'S TOO Real,"S Emotionally, it's suspenseful and all too realistic; I wonder how many of the young men who fight overseas are vulnerable to the teachings of radical anything? Remembering the recordings of Tokyo Rose of WWII attempting to brainwash/seduce the boys to betray their homeland. Terrorism is so scary to contemplate and this series explores my worst fears."
3,"Doesn't Say Much For the CIA, or Plot Direction","The plot is interesting, but each episode it becomes harder to tell the ""Good guys"" from the ""Bad guys"", with CIA ignoring the law, and using any means to stop a far fetched theory to shoot the President at a mile away with a rifle and the wind gusts and heat from an airport making this so improbable that no one would take it serously.The CIA characters worry me more than their targets based on the illegal use of drugs, unbelievable conduct, and contempt for the lie detector with the unreliable results. With all the moles they have found in the real FBI (Hanson) and CIA (Pollard), I'm not sure what the point of this story really is.I doubt that there can be real ""sleepers"" or people programmed to do attempt terrorists acts without being on drugs and having constant brainwashing for long periods of time like Sirhan Sirhan. Now that Brody is supposedly cleared, except for the admitted murder of someone he thought was Walker, it makes a little more sense."
5,I want more!,"Interesting, involved story line that keeps you guessing and on your toes. The cast is excellent, and it was actually sad to watch the last episode, knowing we now have to wait for Season 2 to finish and get released!"
3,Certain Episodes Froze Up Repeatedly,"The show is excellent. Downloading HD (which costs more per episode) wasn't worth the extra money. Some episodes were fine, but when they froze up, there was little you could do. It was extremely frustrating."
4,Loved it,Watched this because of a friend's recommendation and I'm hooked. I would definitely recommend to others. I watched it on Amazon Prime which I love also and have cancelled my subscription to Netflix.
4,"Slow build, great pay off","Homeland Season 1 starts slow, but each episode becomes more interesting. Worth the investment of time. I'm hooked and ready for season 2!"
5,Addictive Show,"I received my DVD of ""Homeland"" the first season shortly after ordering it. It was in perfect condition upon arrival. My husband and I have become engrossed in this show and I can't wait until the second season comes out on DVD so we can purchase and watch it as well."
5,Thrilling and thought provoking!,"This is one of the best shows on TV. The story line pulls you in and the acting is superb (especially Carrie, the main character who is both brilliant and mentally unstable)."
3,May be a victim of its own hype...,"WHile certainly a quality television offering, I thinky the hype was a little bit much for this pilot. I'll likely watch the rest of the series, but I was underwhelmed by the first installment."
3,A Good Spy Thriller,"Homeland is well written and acted, and is a spy mystery thriller worth a watch. It's not plausible, of course, so be prepared to suspend your disbelief."
4,Lots of plot twists.,Claire Danes does a good job portraying someone who is severely Bi-Polar. I feel sorry for her at the end of season 1.
5,Homeland addiction!,"I watched both seasons in less than 2 weeks! Awesome, addictive... Can't wait for season 3.Carrie, Saul and Brody....sensational!"
4,Great Science Fiction,"I always enjoy Doctor Who episodes. The series is interesting as science fiction, and the special effects are always excellent. Keep up the good work."
2,you get what you pay for or a little less,"This little quick reference looks like it was xeroxed on thin crummy paper. It is disorganized and hard to find anything. It's just the menu command, the icons and the keyboard equivalent and a scrap of explanation. I bought 10 of these as classroom handouts and the students were very disappointed."
3,incomplete,"The seine does not come with poles or any type of instructions. As the previous review indicates, the weights are also wholly insufficient. I would suggest trying a different brand."
3,Seine Net,The net seems to be well made except it does not have enough weight to hold the net down. I manually added weight to make it work.
2,Glorified pamphlet,"This is the sort of thing that would be interesting to glance through, but it's basically a glorified pamphlet and it won't tell you anything you can't figure out for yourself from studying old movie stills. ""How to create the perfect Marilyn mole""... doi! Didn't we all know this by 7th grade? Instead of shelling out for this, you'll learn a lot more about vintage style by investing that cash in renting some old Veronica Lake flicks."
2,Very Disappointed,This book has no pictures to further illustrate the points that it makes. It is all in black and white. It is basically information that you would know anyway from general makeup application. It goes through the different eras but doesn't cover in very much detail. At the back there is a recipe section for making your own makeup but it is unlikely that these would be made as some use dangerous products!!Very diasppointed with the book-lucky I bought it second hand.
3,A slender volume but still a nice reference,"Yes, this book is not a comprehensive guide to vintage looks and cosmetics.Yes, the photos are sadly only in black and white.However, the classic film star photos to accompany each look are wonderful. Case in point, the evolution of Gene Tierney from the 1930s with slightly pudfy cheeks to 1940s glamour girl.Defintely snap this one up if you can find a good quality used copy. A discounted price will help soften the blow of the covers being too close together.An expanded, revised edition would be a most welcome addition to my personal library"
2,Please don't pay $300 for this book!,"It is very small. It was only $12.95 at full retail price, and honestly it is not worth it. I did not buy it, but I chose to search for it through my library. If your library does Inter Library Loans, they can often find any book in the USA library system and mail it to your library for a small fee. I paid $3 and have it loaned to me for at least 2-3 weeks."
3,I love this book--but,"I love this book, and I use it all the time for a guide when I'm going to a period event. However, I bought the book when it was cheap and new. I definitely wouldn't plunk down hundreds of dollars for it, so I can understand the disappointment. At a more reasonable price, it's a great book. At those prices, it seems like highway robbery."
1,What is it with flames?,"Don't get me wrong, there is useful information in this book, just not a whole lot of it. And the over-emphasis on flame painting - what's that all about? Perhaps the book should have been titled ""How to Custom Flame Damn Near Anything"". As a practical guide to custom painting it falls short of the many superior other references out there. As a fan book for the Monster Garage series, forget it, as the show only gets a passing mention."
1,Book is far from living up to it's title.,It was just a real letdown. Read it in about an hour. Am I now ready to paint damn near everything? I think not. I gave 20 cents for the book and still feel cheated.
1,Not much usable info here.,"This reads like someones Masters Thesis. The author uses a lot of words to say very little: not much user-friendly info. But if you're having trouble sleeping, and you don't like to take sleeping pills, I highly recommend thisbook."
2,"FUN, BUT NOT TOO INFORMATIVE OR INSTRUCTIONAL","I PURCHASED THIS BOOK/CASSETTE IN THE HOPES THAT MY SON WOULD LEARN SPANISH (OR A BIT OF SPANISH AT LEAST) WHILE HAVING FUN SINGING THE MUSIC. HE NOW KNOWS THE WORDS TO ALL OF THE SONGS IN SPANISH, BUT HE HAS NOT A CLUE TO WHAT HE IS SINGING. IT IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. THERE IS NO INSTRUCTION OR TRANSLATION. I WOULD ONLY RECOMMEND IT TO SOMEONE WHO WAS LOOKING FOR A SPANISH CHILDRENS CASSETTE, NOT TO ONE WHO IS LOOKING TO LEARN SOME OF THE LANGUAGE."
2,Item was smaller than expected,"The pendant was smaller than I expected, even based on the dimensions given - maybe I just couldn't picture the size. The blue topaz stone was a little light in color. I ordered this with a pair of blue topaz earrings which I didn't keep, so I really didn't need to keep the pendant. I returned the items together for a refund and was very pleased at the speed at which I got the refund. I was also pleased at the speed of delivery of the items."
3,Pretty but not substantial,"The stone is pretty, but the whole piece seems too lightweight... cheap. When you hold it in your hands it doesn't have any weight to it. It doesn't look like an expensive piece of jewelry."
4,"Cute ornament. Fairly heavy, as expected.","This is a cute ornament and somewhat hard to find this year so I am glad I was able to purchase it. It's solid resin, so it's a heavy ornament. Works fine with an artificial ornament but would probably be too heavy for a real tree."
5,So Cute!,"Gorgeous, just as discribed. The items are so cute and they were packaged very well. The order was received in less time than expected. Hope to purhase more soon!!!"
3,not enough,If you need this cushion for a long period of time dont get this one. The cushion isn't as good as ones with real memory foam that stay thick while your sitting on them.
3,It is ok - best for someone lighter than me,I weigh 200lb and the foam is not dense enough for me. I would suggest if for people under 150lb. I compress the foam all the way so the support is not what I hoped for.
3,Too big!,"Said it was a ""petite"" cushion yet this thing was huge! Just as big as my regular sleeping pillow. Got it so I could put it in my backpack and use it while in a long lectures for school. Won't fit in my backpack. Make sure you look at the measurement if they have any if you're looking for a small cushion seat. Other than that its very comfortable."
4,The cushion seat is helpful,This cushion is helpful especially when I sit for a long time at my computer desk. I will enjoy it.
4,nice,Tail bone pain is a terrible thing. This cushion helps to take the pressure off the very painful end joint of the spine and I am hoping it will lead to permanent cure.
1,PSP UMD/GAME Case,bought two of them hoping to get all our PSP games and movies in. Well it comes with 4 plastic sleeves that each holds 4 games per sleeve. Problem is if you use all the sleeves and put PSP Games/movies in them. then the case WILL NOT close. So still looking for a great case for them.
4,Quasi-Perfect Compilation,"Unlike the 2003-remake DVD set (greatly criticized because of its erratic episode order), this set (though missing its real 2nd episode, ""Astro vs Atlas"") follows the original Japanese episode ordering, a must for hard-core Astro fans. What I miss here is the US-version opening sequence (instead, they inserted the Japanese opening & credits sequences, accompanied by partial English subtitles you can turn on or off at your own taste); also, they forgot to add the US voice credits (I still wonder who the heck dubbed Astro's voice for the States, but I'm pretty sure neither Candi Milo nor Billie Lou Watt was). Apart from all these flaws, this compile is among the greatest ever made. Even its accompanying booklet, featuring Osamu's bio, is a must."
2,NO SPANISH AUDIO!!!!!!BUAAAAAAAAHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When I was very little I grew up by watching Astro Boy in the 80's. It was SOOO COOOOL because I woke up every morning in the weekend getting my breakfeast and ready to have some fun watching Astro Boy. Of course! It was in spanish because Im from Puerto Rico and nothing is better to watch a saturday morning cartoon in your language.I hope that one day this DVD collection will have multiple languages. I know that there is another collection of Astro Boy in multple languages but is the present series, and Im not interested in the new Astro Boy, Im a fan of ""Old School""!!!P.S: At least Im happy for G-Force, Robotech and Evangelion dvds in spanish.Adios."
5,The Original Anime Hero,"Early anime on USA tv can be counted on one hand: Starblazers, Speed Racer, Gigantor, and Astro Boy. When I searched for Astro Boy some time back, the videos hadn't made it to DVD. I finally got a Japanese edition with English and Chinese audio tracks from Japanimation.com.The first thing I realized was that although I'd always loved what I'd seen of Astro Boy, the series was far better than I'd remembered. Tezuka eeked a lot of emotion and character out of his manga, as the recent reprint series by Dark Horse shows, but these qualities survived intact the jump to TV.As with Gigantor, some modern viewers are allergic to anything in black and white (while retro fans eagerly track those copies down). This is the color series but it's not to be confused with the recent remake (in the black box) shown on Cartoon Network. Being both in color and fondly remembered by many viewers from the '80s, this box set will be welcomed by the many fans of Tezuka's best-loved creation."
4,Pleasure to see O'Henry's characters,"Nice set of screen versions of 3 O'Henry's stories illustrating different facets of his style: 1 dramatic (""The Roads we Take"")+ 1 slightly melancholy humor (""Makes the Whole World Kin"")+ 1 eccentric (""The Ransom of Red Chief""). Excellent work of a few comedy stars of the 60s - 70s. The example of early work of the most talented Soviet comedy director Leonid Gaidai. The only thing I wish the disc had - English subtitles, though the screen versions are so detailed that one can enjoy them simply right after reading the stories themselves."
4,Kaleidoscopic Mystery,"This novel was very unordinary as a Mason mystery; no trials, no clients charged with murder and Mason acted not as a lawyer but as a detective. The novel showed me various pictures like a kaleidoscope page by page; a mysterious empty tin, gunshot and bloodstrain but no corpse, another corpse in another house, secret smuggling business, domestic disputes between sisters-in-law and so on."
4,"Not what I first thought, but some gems","I bought this after reading the Preface by David Duchovny in the Wall Street Journal. Thought it was about how coaches influence lives. George Vecsey's essay on Casey Stengel immediately let me know I approached the book in the wrong manner. Not the book's fault. Just read a true gem by John Edgar Wideman, pure poetry for anybody who has played pickup basketball. One or two more like that one, and I'll forget all about why I thought I was purchasing it."
3,A Decent Coaching Clinic,"This is an anthology of articles about coaches who influenced each of the writers in the book. The pieces themselves are hit and miss with some great stories by George Vecsey, Benjamin Cheever and Frank DeFord among others, but there are also several that just aren't that interesting. The benefit is that you don't have to read any of the chapters that don't interest you and the good ones are worth the price of the book. I would recommend this for a quick read of some inspirational stories, but not as a comprehensive anthology about the greatness of coaches or what makes them special."
3,Informative but too detailed for a quick read,"I had ordered the book on the basis of some good reviews on Amazon. The book is very informative and exhaustive especially the topics on Bipolar and BiCMOS circuits. However, the book is too detailed and can be overwhelming for a beginner. I just wish the author had cut down on the content."
5,Finally a hands-on approach to analog IC layout!,"Books on layouting integrated circuits that are practical and don't use an overwhelming amount of maths are very hard to find. But now Alan Hastings has come up with ""The Art of Analog Integrated Circuits"". Based on his own experience as a circuit and layout designer, he covers every aspect of IC layouting, covering bipolar, CMOS and BiCMOS. He uses a hands-on approach, trading maths for intuitive insights, and gives pointers to overcome real-world problems (somewhat like the other ""The Art of..."" electronics book!). Important topics include failure mechanisms (ESD, latch-up, ...), matching, device merging, guard rings, high-voltage devices and many more. In short, THE book for anyone that needs an introduction into analog IC layout."
5,Well written and useful book for the CMOS designer.,"I read Hasting's book when it was in manuscript form, and recommended to Tom Robbins at Prentice-Hall they they publish it. It is full of state-of-the-art information, techniques, and tips that anyone in CMOS IC design would find useful. Many of these are of the type usually only learned from experience. Drawings are accurate, and clear explanations accompany every topic. Alan Hasting's book is a valuable text for the beginner, and an excellent reference for the practicing engineer."
3,Be careful of purchasing the international edition,The international edition in softcover is shamefully printed in gray scale. This makes the different mask layers hard to distinguish.
2,Oh Come On!!!,"This book was a waste of money. I know that he's a new author, but come on. He could've done SOOO much more with this great storyline. There was no real conclusion and it was a difficult book to get through for me, somebody who reads nonstop. I expected so much more from this. Don't buy this. If you really want to read it, get it at the library or convince somebody else to get it and borrow it from them. Just don't waste your money on this. Instead, buy ""What Happened to Cass McBride"". It's better."
2,Infomercial,"What you begin to notice when reading this book is the constant reference to a particular website, which has the same name as the title. And at this site you can BUY all the ancient remedies touched on in the book.This book is an extended pitch for the website, folks.Please, look elsewhere."
3,herb book,"not a very informative book in my opinion lots of pages but not much in the stuff i wanted to see, may be good for herbalists. but not for me"
4,Kills bugs dead,"Worked as described, killed the ants in my 1500 Sq foot rental unit. Didn't leave a bad smell and was easy to use. I'd recommend it."
4,Two time is a charm,"I don't own a pet so it puzzels me when I started getting flea bites on my body. On the first night after used the first fogger, I got two new bites. I used second fogger on the following night and now it seems to do the trick (fingers crossed)."
4,Raid fogger,The fogger was difficult to use and was not as effective as it declared on the box. Some spiders remained unscathed
3,Better foggers out there,"This worked okay. I bought them for tiny ants invading my home on floor level. Ant traps are better if your kids/dogs will leave them alone. 3 foggers come in one box, I used all three in my 900 square foot home - putting them near the 3 rooms with any issues. Maybe would have worked better if I would have used more foggers, but it did kill all the flying insects and a couple beetles. About 50% of the ants died, but the rest remained to live another day (after which I used ant spray on - worked like a charm)"
1,Ineffective for flea control.,"We set off the full package (three foggers) in our basement and let it sit for six hours. Upon our return we were immediately beset by fleas. There's no evidence that a single one had died. Apparently, many flea populations have developed resistance to permethrin, which is the only active ingredient in this fogger.Look for a fogger that contains various agents, so you will have a better likelihood that one of them will work. Also, look for a product that has an IGR (Insect Growth Regulator) as it will also kill eggs and larvae -- permethrin alone will not do this.Finally, permethrin is reasonably safe for dogs and humans, but pretty dangerous for cats, so if you have cats you may want to avoid permethrin-based products altogether."
2,Useless on fleas,"This stuff seems to work OK with most bugs but is worthless for fleas and some kinds of spiders. I recently moved into a house that had been empty for over a year and the place was literally crawling with spiders. This fumigator killed some, but left more than a dozen black widows living happily near the ceiling. I used a bug spray to knock them down.My dog brought in some fleas and we soon had an infestation. Six fumigators later we still have LOTS of fleas. I finally had to get an exterminator to kill the fleas in the house. A flea bath and a collar fixed up the dog."
4,A fun movie...,"This was a good movie, and it is always enjoyable to see Jackie Chan branch out a bit and show his acting ability (though, this was not the best of his movies for that.) I have to say that, even though I have my own copy of this movie and have watched it and enjoyed it several times, I am never able to suspend my disbelief. I am always bothered by the disparity in the ages of Jackie Chan and his leading teenager! I will be glad when Jackie Chan stops playing 20-somethings and moves entirely into his true age group with roles that allow him to show off his acting range (which is actually quite impressive.) The man is a good actor, and he can sing! As he matures and his impressive martial arts and acrobatic abilities inevitably change, I would like to see him develop and share his other abilities."
4,A good movie.,"Another good film from Jackie. There are some incredible fight scenes but not many (if any) stunts. The English dubbing is appauling. It just doesn't work, but it's a small price to pay for such a great film. Worth a watch."
3,Not bad,"As Chan's movies go i didnt think this was one of his better ones. but it does have some interesting characters, jacki's rival in it is by far my favorite. alot of good fight scenes and some new faces which was good. overall good fun and not overly serious which makes a nice change. worth a watch if you like action or are a fan of chan."
4,Jackie's first romantic comedy,"I've seen the HK version of this and think that it isn't half bad. The fight scenes are pretty good, and Bradley James Allan is awesome too. If you ask me, the real 'gorgeous' aspect of this movie is Hsu Chi!!!"
5,Gorgeous for sure!,"I watched this on Starz movie channel a few months ago, and after that, watched it again every time it came on! The minute I saw it was up for preorder, I had to order it. This movie is worth the price just for the girl in it. She is so GORGEOUS-(shameless plug)! She really is beautiful. What can I say though, I love asian girls. Besides her being such eye-candy, the movie itself is great. Jackie Chan is great, as he always is. Not as much action-oriented as you may like for a Jackie Chan flik, but...the girl!"
2,Average Jackie Film at Best,"I say this because Jackie doesn't usually do wired Kung-Fu and this movie utilized that. It also utilized the sped up frame rate to make the fighters appear more skilled. Now that being said, the martial artists really are quite skilled. They really are pretty quick. They really can do most of those moves. It had some OK though special effects assisted fights, but this movie wasn't really about that. Jackie Chan was trying to break into ""real"" acting in this movie. I wouldn't buy it if you are trying to watch him fight, and if you buy it for the story....well that's your choice I guess."
4,Pretty good,"i give this movie 3 1/2 stars, while it still has some really cool fight scenes, (beats up a gane with some metal baseball bats, and two of jackie's greatest one on one fights i have ever seen) yet it still is not my type of music. its kinda like a chinese rocky, and i dont really like that there is a dreamy music in the backround throughout the whole move literally."
2,TO EACH HIS OWN,"As a super fan of Jackie Chan and one who sees his movies over and over again I must say Gorgeous, was ""not good"" the plot is silly but most importantly a natural flow from one scene to another is missing. But if you are a collector, it's worth having just for the FANTASTIC FIGHT scene with Brad Allen."
3,Jackie Chan Gorgeous,I would like to review it but as of yet I have not recived it. It is looking like it will never arrive so at this time it's probly a good movie I just failed ro recive it. Now that I'm moving away I will not be able to review it at all.
3,Decent Jackie movie,"So I was pretty impressed with Gorgeous until the end came around. I enjoyed the non violence theme and could definitely get with the humor that I was being given. Odd, but still funny and enjoyable. Seeing Jackie in a non comedic role was very interesting. You won't find that very often. The first fight Jackie has with Brad Allen is certainly gorgeous but the finale is just pure crapola. I really wish they wouldn't have turned to the comedy and made Jackie into the stupid character he always plays. Shu Qi does a very good job in trying to make herself Jackie's love interest. Fun movie, could have been way better though.I was really looking forward to the Jackie commentary and while it was very informative, it was just an interview and he wasn't actually watching the movie with us, at least it seemed that way. The making of also gives you an more of an inside view of the film. You can tell that the cast and crew had one heck of a good time making this movie."
2,Jackie Chan Exercises Acting Muscles,"Not your typical Jackie Chan flick, which is why the rating is not higher. There are some very funny scenes involving a gay character and the female lead. Also hilarious is the short guy chasing Jackie all over to fight him. I found the age difference between Jackie and his co-star to be disturbing. Jackie looks great for his age, but his young co-star plays a naive young woman, and she comes across even younger than she really is. Not that there are any real love scenes between them, but there is a kiss and all I could think was ""ICK."""
2,Kinda Korny,"Who would actually go on a plane because, of some stupid message in a bottle? The fighting was stupid too, who would waste time to pick out a pair of cheap gloves? It's english dubbed that means the people who can read the chineese script to translate it in english can't act for beans. I think Jackie Chan should leave little girls alone and fall in-love with someone his age. I like Jackie Chan and everything but, this movie was kinda wack."
1,Gorgeous,"I am a huge Jackie Chan fan, but this movie was a huge disappointment. I know there are fans out there who think Jackie can do no wrong, but this film was a real stinker. I will let this slide since he has given us so much great and original work, but I am just praying that this is not a taste of things to come. I still have a bad taste in my mouth from this one."
1,WHAT THE ... IS THIS ...???,"this is by far the worst Jackie Chan movie since the horrible fantasy mission force! I can't believe I paid 5 dollars to rent this piece of ...! IF YOU LIKE ACTION MOVIES, DO NOT RENT THIS! IT HAS 2 GOOD ACTION SCENES AND THAT'S IT!THIS MOVIE LICKS!"
1,This is the most boring Jackie Chen movie ever seen.,The most boring Jackie Chen movie I have ever seen. Basically his movies have bad scripts but good actions. This one has less actions and a bad love story.
1,Jackie Chan's Gorgeous,"This movie was a total waste of time and money. The acting was bad, the plot was stupid, the action scenes rare and not that amazing considering Jackie's previous movies, and the dubbing was atrocious. They didn't even allow Jackie to do his own dubbing. Do not buy."
3,Most annoying - but best Chan fight scene EVER!,"Shu Qi is so annoying I cringed whenever she opened her mouth in this mediocre Chan film. I dunno, maybe Chan was dating her or something. A love story? Bleh. I hated it.I can only recommend the movie for the absolutely stunning fight scenes pitting Chan with Brad Allen. Incredible martial arts action. No wires and camera stunts here - just pure, unadulterated, REAL fight moves performed by two of the best film martial artists you'll ever have the fortune to see."
4,"Not your typical good vs. evil, action hero vs. villian","This movie has a lot of comedy, and to be honest in many ways different from your standard Jackie Chan flick, I liked his co-Star, I dont know her name but she has some sexy @$$ lips though. This has your crazy and amazing fight scenes that are so creative and only Jackie can pull em off. The last fight scene with ""Adam"" the fight scene is more of a gentlemens fight, they have respect for each other, and its a pretty long fight scene, well worth the wait, the guy who plays ""Adam"" is actually a student of Jackie chan, you might recongize him in the background in ""Mr. Nice Guy"" as a ""thug"". The so called ""Villian"" in this movie, is not a villian at all, Hes a childhood rival of jackies who of course is trying to out due jackie in everything. Hes actually pretty funny, this movie to me is a overall love first action second movie. Pretty good movie, I bought it cause Im trying to complete my Jackie Chan collection and Im glad I did."
2,"An inane movie, with some killer scenes.","As far as Chan's movies go, this one ranks near the bottom of my list. The plot is nonsensical, and the dubbing certainly doesn't help. If you're looking for a Jackie Chan movie that you can actually enjoy on its own merits, then skip this one.However.This movie does have the distinction of having some of the greatest fight scenes I've ever seen Jackie do. You will regret seeing the movie afterwards, but these scenes (almost) make up for the rest of this lackluster movie."
3,The Asian version of Pretty Woman.,"To tell the truth, I don't quite like the story. It's like watching an Asian version of Pretty Woman. Everything is so perfect and so beautiful... It's annoying!But the rare fight scenes (4 in all) are great and funny to watch, particularly the last one, which lasts about 10 minutes. In it, we can see Jackie Chan's talent as a martial artist.As for the DVD, the only complaint I have is that there are not enough supplements. The quality for the picture and the sound is almost perfect. We can always count on Columbia/Tri-Star to give us DVDs of high standards."
2,For Chan Fans only,"Jackie Chan could make a successful love story for an American audience, NOT THIS ONE! He plays a middle-aged, very boring, badly dubbed business man who falls for a flighty, yet beautiful...child. Bu (the flighty kid)should be marrying her sweetheart but instead falls for the boring, badly dubbed clean freak with the stupid name, CN (ChaN). I love Jackie Chan so I'm glad to have this title in my collection but I'd like to see him play a Chan role and find an energetic equal for a partner. (try less Pretty Woman, more Raiders of the Lost Ark)"
5,Best product on the market!,"This all and one wipe is Great for leather, vinyl and plastic, I have been using it for a couple of years now and it works on everything. It leave a lasting low gloss shine and protects very well. It also leaves leather interiors soft and supple like an old leather glove.Lando"
1,Turns leather into shiny sticky vinyl,YUCK!I trusted the brand new leather seats in my MX-5 to this junk. They're now sticky and shiny. Caveat Emptor.
2,Leather wipes,"These are handy, smell nice, and are nice sized...but did not produce the results I was expecting on my car's leather seats."
5,Leather conditioner,This product is great for touchups on leather seats. Use between more agressive leather conditioning.
1,100% disappointed,"I didn't expect these wipes to work as well as liquid cleaners and conditioners, but at the same time I didn't expect them to leave the seats feeling a big greasy and make them leather feel harder.I first used these wipes, but didn't see much effect. I then used a specific product that was a cleaner only, and finished with Lexol to condition it. Made a huge improvement.Later I used the wipes again, and was disappointed to get a greasy feeling on the seats, as well as the leather somehow feeling harder than when I started.I'll keep them around until they're gone to wipe up spills or quick spot cleaning, but overall these wipes performed worse than my already limited expectations."
3,Cleaned Well but Left Leather Too Greasy,I bought this product to clean and condition my brand new black leather interior in my car. I was not expecting it to leave the leather so shiny and greasy looking. It recommends using a terry cloth towel after to decrease shine but it still left it too shiny for my liking. I will use them until they run out but will definitely buy a new product next time.
1,Took the Softness and Plushness Out of My Seats,This product is easy to apply and is very convenient. That is about all I can say in the pro-column.My seats now feel like plastic or vinyl. I have the optional soft leather package in my car and the leather now feels like fake garbage from the 80's economy cars. I am so irritated. I think the protective coating it leaves makes for a stiff and slippery seat.This weekend will be spent doing what I can removing this stuff from the seats. This is the first product from this manufacturer that I have been disappointed in.Follow Up: I have been able to wash the plastic residue for the most part. My back seats were not treated and are obviously softer and nicer. I'm still irritated. Going with a serious (and much more expensive) leather conditioner to see if I can restore what I had.
5,Outstanding portable leather cleaner!,"I took this product on a trip and it was very useful twice. My grandmother almost always makes a mess when she decides to eat while we are on the road she also likes to drink one of those shakes for diabetics. Well, part of the shake ended up on the leather seat, my wife tried to help and made it worse... I just took a single wipe and cleaned it completely, very easy to use, and it left a good protection layer just like the Meguiars Gold Class Rich Leather Cleaner does. The only thing I did after wiping the seat was using a microfiber cloth to remove a bit of the excess and spread it more evenly, also very easy. The leather was just like new and read to be used again. Very nice smell also."
2,Wouldn't buy these wipes again,"I used these on the leather of my 2005 Lexus ES 330 because of the perforated leather. They made my soft comfortable leather feel hard, shiny and cheap. I would never buy these again. Now to figure how to get this stuff off!"
5,"What's new about ""Hot August Night""?","The previous reviewers have all done a wonderful job of commenting on this album, but their comments overlook my personal reasons for buying the album. I have the original LP, the original two-CD set, and the ""Original Master Recording."" Why bother to put out the cash for yet another reissue of this album? Easy--because of the extra cuts: the first live performance of ""Walk on Water"" available anywhere, the return of ""Kentucky Woman"" to the set (an omission I always wondered about, considering that things like ""Soggy Pretzels"" were included), and an exquisite performance of ""Stones,"" long omitted from concerts and recordings alike because it was feared to be too much of a downer for live settings. I'm biased because it's always been my fave, but try to convince anybody this cut is less than awesome!!!"
5,Unique and unparalled !,"Its a pity that these performances at the Greek Theatre in LA is not (yet!) available in VDO as this concert was recorded in 1972 when Neil Diamond was considered one of the hottest properties for any recording company. He was at his prime when his voice had that cutting edge and his compositions were indeed awesome by any standards. By any yardsticks this album is a masterpiece and considered as a tracing point for his later live albums.Each track has been rendered with his awesome power and style. With his unique band and a string sections with horns, the music comes alive and leaves you wanting for more and more. And since this album is now remastered and re-released with additional tracks, perhaps the VDO maybe not so far behind.If you dont own this album or havent heard any tracks, here is that golden opportunity to get it now with additional bonus tracks.Indeed as Robert Hilburn commented,'His audience falls like plums at his feet.'"
5,Great CD,"This CD arrived quicker than I had expected, and it was in excellent shape. I enjoyed listening to this when I was younger, and still enjoy it now."
4,Diamond,"My wife and I are both fans of Neil Diamond. We had the music on the CD ""Hot August Night"" on an old cassette tape that was pretty worn. Now we can enjoy the remastered version!"
2,Sound quality is terrible!,"This is one of the best albums of all time but this particular CD/Company/ remake is NOT the original... The sound quality is terrible. If you are going to buy this CD, find the original... not this one."
1,Neil Diamond Hot August Night expanded 2CD,"I'll be sending this back. Either I got a bad copy or the technician who inserted the track segues sucks big time. The transition between each song has a burp or gap which disrupts the flow. Very annoying. Like a skip in the old LP. If my replacement is the same, then this sadly, will be BAD NEWS, and save your money. Is it a big deal? Imagine your TV station switching to a commercial with one last play in the Super Bowl. Like that.Anyone else with this issue?"
3,Poor Sound quality,"I bought this CD based on reviews on this site giving this 5 stars. I am extremely unhappy with the sound quality of this CD. Obviously, I love Neil Diamond's music or I would not have purchased this. But I am disappointed in this CD."
3,The Second Best Live Recording,"Actually, the Gold live album, which was earlier, was better because his voice was stronger. If you listen to Gold, you will understand why his voice is so shot on this cd. His live albums got worse and worse, but this one still had moments. The Prologue is tremendous, and Cherry, Caroline and You'll Be a Woman Soon are great versions. If you are a fan, you already have it, but if you are a casual fan, there are better places to go than this."
2,Not what I expected,The original CD set consisted of 2 CD's.The product that I received only contained 1 CD (disk 2).I wrote to the seller and he was unable to complete the order.He then refunded my entire purchase price.the first CD of the set contains the Prolough and is followed by Crunchy Granola Suite. This is the piece of the CD set that I was most interested in.
5,Hot August Night-Neil Diamond,The intro on this CD is worth every penny spent. The haunting instrumentals before Neil Diamond takes the stage will be with you forever. The remastered & expanded version is a MUST for your collection! I'll have to buy another one to keep on hand so when this one is worn out I'll still have this music. BUY IT...you won't regret it!!
5,great live disc,"I think this is the first neil diamond cd i actually bought. when i was a kid, my dad liked (and still likes ) neil's music, and i thought it was wack. now that i am older and after a few listens of 'hot august night', i can honestly say i am a neil diamond fan. a lot of great tunes on here the band sounds great. i discovered a lot of songs i hadn't heard. before this i was only familiar with the big hits. standout tunes on this collection are : play me, canta libre, walk on water, solitary man, cryin in your pretzels, and red red wine (way cooler than ub40's version). pick this disc up, you won't be disappointed"
4,Beasts,Beasts was a very interesting and enjoyable take on this subject. The story flowed quite well and I thought the character development was well thought out and executed. I was able to connect on an emotional level with each of the major characters. I can't wait for the sequel.
